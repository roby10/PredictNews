1,AXP,EBay buys Zong as mobile payments gain traction,"NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - EBay Inc said on Thursday it agreed to buy cellphone payments provider Zong for about $240 million in cash to help its PayPal unit push further into mobile commerce.  EBay does not expect the deal to affect its financial outlook. It should close in the third quarter of 2011.  Zong is eBay’s seventh acquisition so far in 2011. Other deals this year include the purchase of GSI Commerce, Magento and Where. The company is buying businesses and technology that can help it work with more merchants as commerce moves increasingly online.  The strategy has been welcomed so far by investors. EBay shares rose 1.4 percent at $33.38 on Thursday afternoon, leaving them up more than 17 percent so far this year.  Zong is a leader in mobile payments for virtual and digital goods, offering one of the main ways to load up on social-networking currency Facebook Credits and quickly purchase items while playing social games like Zynga’s FarmVille.  Zong lets shoppers pay through their mobile phone account. When checking out online, a customer enters his or her number in a box. Zong verifies it and sends a text, to which the customer replies. The payment shows up on the wireless bill at the end of the month.  Zong has access to 3.2 billion mobile users through relationships with more than 250 wireless carriers in 45 countries.  For PayPal, the deal will let its 100 million users fund their accounts with their phones — something the company didn’t offer before.  The move comes as PayPal tries to defend its business against inroads by Visa, MasterCard, Google Inc and big U.S. banks, which are developing ways for customers to pay online or with phones as well as cards.  The total value of mobile payments may reach $670 billion by 2015, from $240 billion this year, according to a recent Juniper Research forecast.  “Online and offline payment worlds are blurring with the growth of mobile and smart phones,” said Dana Stalder, general partner of venture capital firm Matrix Partners, which invested in Zong.  “It’s increasingly important for anyone in the payment industry to have mobile phone numbers authenticated and attached to their wallet offerings,” added Stalder, a former PayPal employee who helped start projects including PayPal Mobile.  With Zong, PayPal gets 30 million authenticated phone numbers already attached to payment accounts, he noted.  In a typical online checkout, shoppers see four options: Visa, MasterCard, American Express and PayPal. The fifth option is paying with a mobile phone number, Stalder added.  “PayPal will effectively be the payment operator behind two of the five main payment options in online checkout flows,” he said.  Zong will also give PayPal another way to make sure its nine million merchants get sales completed online quickly and smoothly.  Wireless carriers have low limits on transaction sizes and volume currently. If a Zong mobile purchase hits such caps, it will be easy to shift that transaction to another source of cash in the PayPal system, Stalder explained.  “What the merchant cares about is completed transactions,” he said. “This is a way of offering more funds-in capabilities and higher converting checkout flow for merchants.”  Ultimately, Stalder sees an opportunity for a company to create a “wallet in the cloud” that is funded by all sources of money and can be used to pay for anything online and offline.  In May, Google, MasterCard, Citigroup, Sprint and transaction processing company First Data unveiled a new service that lets shoppers pay for things with mobile phones.  A day after the announcement, PayPal sued Google for allegedly stealing trade secrets related to mobile payment systems.  On Thursday, PayPal Chief Financial Officer Patrick Dupuis said the Zong purchase wasn’t a reaction to rivals’ efforts to build mobile wallet businesses.  “There’s been a lot of chit chat on this. We don’t think mobile wallet. We just think wallet. We’re there. We’ve been in digital for six years,” Dupuis told Reuters. “I think it’s the other guys who are trying to compete with us.”  ",7072011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ebay/ebay-buys-zong-as-mobile-payments-gain-traction-idUSTRE7663E420110707
2,AXP,Wall St Week Ahead-Stocks stymied without a US debt deal," NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks will be hard pressed to turn the tide of recent selling next week as political jousting over raising the United States’ debt ceiling intensifies.   The benchmark S&P 500 index this week recorded its worst weekly loss in five weeks.   Investors, frustrated by the lack of progress in the debate between the Democrat-controlled White House and Senate and the Republican-majority House, could move into what are perceived as safer assets, such as cash.   While the wrangling over the debt ceiling takes center stage, earnings season will continue to heat up after a solid first week. According to Thomson Reuters data, 39 companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index .SPX have posted results, with 74 percent reporting earnings that topped Wall Street estimates.   Companies in the index are forecast to show a 6.5 percent rise in profits over the second quarter of 2010 when all the reports are in.   For this week, the S&P 500 ended down 2.1 percent; the Dow fell 1.4 percent and the Nasdaq declined 2.5 percent.   The overhang from the debt ceiling issue could diminish the focus on earnings.   House Speaker John Boehner, the top U.S. Republican in Congress, said President Barack Obama and Democrats had still not put a serious deficit plan on the table, underscoring the acrimony in negotiations to avert a government default. For details, see [ID:nN1E76D26R]   “The news flow next week dealing with the deficit issues and the political posturing that is taking place is going to intensify and is really going to drive these markets,” said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont.   “People are starting to get nervous about what they are seeing out there. For a portfolio manager — let alone an average investor — this is a treacherous market to be trying to position yourself in.”   Economic data on tap for next week includes several reports on the housing market — June housing starts on Tuesday and existing-home sales on Wednesday. In addition, data is due on leading economic indicators for June and the Philadelphia Fed survey of manufacturing activity in the Mid-Atlantic region. Economic reports over the last month have raised questions about the health of the U.S. recovery.   “The bigger picture is the economy is still a disaster,” said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.   Saluzzi said people still are watching earnings for signs growth may be stagnating. “Eventually, companies are not going to keep cutting costs.”   Quarterly results are expected from a slew of companies next week, with more than 10 Dow components scheduled to report.   Major financial companies due to report include Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and American Express (AXP.N). Also on the calendar are earnings news from technology companies Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O).   “Let’s see what all the rest of these guys have. Let’s see if it’s still being driven by cost cuts or are they actually getting revenue gains. That is going to tell me a lot more than if they cut the debt deal,” said Saluzzi.   After the S&P 500 weekly loss, the index was just below its 50-day moving average, a technical level which could indicate more selling. Some analysts believe the market could still come back if the U.S. debt issue is resolved soon.   “This area, as far as it pulling back, is balancing the threat of a default, but it would take an actual default to take us much lower than here,” said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. in San Francisco.   But the longer the debt ceiling question continues without a conclusion, the bigger the risk for further declines in stocks and for volatility to spike.

That will be an overhang no matter how good the financials come in terms of earnings reports next week,” said Tommy Huie, chief investment officer of BMO Asset Management U.S. in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.   “It could be a pretty volatile week, no doubt about it.”  (Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Kenneth Barry)  (Wall St Week Ahead appears every Friday.

8,AXP,UPDATE 2-Isis hooks up with four payment networks," * Isis in deals with Visa, MasterCard, Discover, Amex   * Still expects to offer service in 2012   * Sees 2012 launch with “handful” of banks   (Adds Isis comment, background)   By Sinead Carew   NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) -  Isis, a venture of three of the top four U.S. mobile providers, plans to launch mobile payments services with major payment networks Visa (V.N), MasterCard (MA.N), Discover (DFS.N) and American Express (AXP.N), the venture said on Tuesday.   The venture of Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc (T.N), and T-Mobile USA hopes to convince consumers to start using their mobile phones to pay for goods instead of plastic credit cards or cash.   Isis, which plans to kick off its service in the first half of 2012, will compete with Google Inc (GOOG.O) and No. 3 U.S. mobile service Sprint Nextel (S.N), which plan to launch services this summer.   Now that it has signed up the four payment networks, Isis expects to be able to more easily finalize deals with banks that issue credit cards, Ryan Hughes, Isis Chief Marketing Officer, told Reuters.   “It delivers a message to the banking community,” said Hughes, who noted that banks needed to know that their payment network partners would work with Isis before signing up as partners for the service.   Which payment networks are involved in the service launch depends on whether Isis has been able to sign up the network’s bank partners, said Hughes, who expects to have a “handful” of banks ready for its launch next year.   Participating banks need to invest in new technology to support a mobile payments and several have already done so, according to Hughes, who would not name bank partners.   Isis expects to make money from the service by generating revenue from their financial services partners and by offering merchants the option to link loyalty programs or coupon offerings to the Isis service, the executive said.   For example, instead of printing out a coupon found on a merchant’s website, consumers would be able to click on an Isis button to have the coupon delivered to their cellphone. Then the coupon could be applied automatically during a mobile transaction in that merchant’s store.   Hughes said merchants will be able to access an application interface to link their offerings with Isis.   While the company is still working on pricing for mobile payments, Hughes said he expects Isis to “take a small percentage of the cost of delivering” an ad or coupon to the Isis application.   In countries such as the United States, where most people have bank accounts and credit cards, analysts see easy-to-use electronic coupons and loyalty programs as the main way for wireless companies to convince consumers to pay with their cellphones instead of their credit cards.

10,AXP,American Express posts higher quarterly earnings,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American Express Co (AXP.N) posted a 31 percent increase in second quarter profits, beating analysts’ expectations, as customers spent more on their cards and the company’s processing revenue jumped.  Average spending on the company’s cards for the quarter rose 15 percent to $3,767 from the same period a year ago and the number of outstanding American Express cards rose 6 percent to 94 million.  “You’re definitely seeing very strong spending growth and the question is how long can the strength persist?” said Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst covering credit card companies at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York.  Part of the spending growth is because consumers in general are spending more in the United States. The U.S. Census Bureau said last week that retail sales rose 7.7 percent in the second quarter from the same period a year ago.  But part of the growth is because American Express is spending more on its rewards program to encourage its customers to spend more.  The company spent more than $1.6 billion on its rewards program during the quarter, up 35 percent from last year’s second quarter. In the first quarter, American Express boosted its marketing and rewards spending by 30 percent.  In the second quarter, the rising rewards cost came from customers redeeming more reward points and from each reward point costing the company a little more.  Customers are ultimately redeeming a little more than 92 percent of their rewards points, compared with about 91 percent last year. Every 1 percentage point increase in rewards redemptions costs the company about $283 million.  Offering better rewards encourages customers to spend more on their American Express cards. The company has been focusing on making money from processing credit and debit card transactions, which is less risky than lending, so better rewards are a key engine for boosting profits.  American Express has few choices, but to offer better rewards as rivals such as JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) court its best customers — wealthy consumers who pay off their credit or charge card bills in full every month.  “There has been a war for the premium end of the industry for 15 years. If we were complacent, we’d lose market share,” Chief Financial Officer Dan Henry said on a conference call on Wednesday.  The New York-based company posted quarterly earnings for common shareholders of $1.32 billion, or $1.10 a share, compared with $1.00 billion, or 84 cents a share, in the same quarter last year.  Earnings per common share from continuing operations were $1.07, exceeding Wall Street analysts’ average estimate of $0.99, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  In another effort to drive customers to spend more on their American Express card, the company said earlier this week it is working with merchants to offer coupons to customers via Facebook. Those coupons and special offers can only be redeemed if the customer makes a purchase using their American Express card.  In the years leading up to the credit crunch, the company boosted profit by making more loans, only to be burned by customer defaults. American Express is one of the few companies that issues credit cards and has its own processing network.  The company’s credit losses have been abating in recent quarters. American Express set aside $357 million to cover bad loans in the quarter, a 45 percent drop from the same quarter last year.  Total revenue excluding interest expense rose 12 percent to $7.62 billion. Processing revenue rose 16 percent to $4.28 billion.

14,AXP,Competition pushing rates down for cyberinsurance,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rates for cybersecurity insurance edged lower in the last few months despite surging demand, as heavy competition brewed among insurers rushing into the market in search of the next profitable product, insurance brokers Marsh said on Wednesday.  A series of high-profile data breaches at companies including Sony Corp and Citigroup have drawn sudden attention to “cyberinsurance,” which covers everything from the cost of notifying customers their data has been breached to the cost of defending against those customers’ lawsuits.  A number of brokers told Reuters in early June that their phones were ringing off the hook, with some customers seeking coverage limits of up to $200 million for new policies. Such huge limits are noteworthy, since less than 5 percent of all data breaches cost more than $20 million.  Yet despite all that demand, there has also been a marked increase in the number of insurers willing to write such policies. Travelers Companies Inc, one of the largest property and casualty insurers in the world, launched its own program last month, and others like Chubb Corp are increasingly aggressive in the market as well.  “We see a major player come into the space once a quarter, once every other quarter, so capacity continues to exceed demand,” said Bob Parisi, a senior vice president in the financial and professional liability practice at Marsh, a unit of Marsh & McLennan.  “You’ve got $100 million, $200 million in capacity chasing $25 million in risk. It’s the undiscovered country, everyone’s looking for a growth area.”  Amid that competition, Marsh said cyberinsurance rates fell an average of 2 percent in the second quarter. Insurers are giving their customers extra coverage in an attempt to hold the line on rates, but prices are still falling, Marsh said.  Those concessions include raising coverage limits, lowering deductibles, or adopting a more liberal interpretation of what counts as a claim — all of which benefit the customer at the expense of greater risk for the insurer.  As it has been for years, one of the biggest problems is accurate pricing. Customers face huge risks and insurers are still developing standards to figure out who is worth covering and who is uninsurable at any price.  “You’re insuring all the nonsmoking, low-cholesterol iron workers — they do something inherently dangerous but they’re well-trained and they’re all healthy,” Parisi said, by way of an analogy to describe how insurers approach cyber risk.  Of all the categories of coverage that exist, Marsh said the biggest increase in claims during the most recent quarter was for privacy-related claims, such as notifying customers their data had been breached and giving them credit monitoring and identity theft services.  A year of credit monitoring services has been become a standard offering from companies to their customers after a data breach, consumer advocates say.  Even so, new risks continue to emerge all the time. The latest is social media, particularly as financial companies increasingly tie up with social networks, like the American Express deal this week with Facebook.  “No one has any idea what risk social media and social networks are creating yet,” Parisi said.

16,AXP,Analysis: Groupon growth lures rivals and regulators,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Groupon Inc’s rapid growth has attracted rivals and regulators, a twin threat to the largest online daily deal company as it gets ready for an initial public offering.  At a daily deals conference in San Francisco this week, executives from AT&T Inc, MasterCard Inc and Facebook described plans to expand in the industry. Google Inc, which tried to buy Groupon last year, is forging ahead with its own daily discounts on local goods and services.  “Groupon has faced big challenges this year and a lot of those have come from competitors,” said Boyan Josic, chief executive officer of daily deal tracker DailyDealMedia. “It’s a huge new sector that’s growing like crazy and there are no real regulations or industry standards.”  Last week, Connecticut’s attorney general said Groupon’s vouchers might violate state law. And industry regulation will be the topic of a panel discussion at a DailyDealMedia conference in September.  Groupon filed for an initial public offering in June, saying it hoped to raise at least $750 million. The IPO may value Groupon at $20 billion or more, although concern about competition and regulation may limit that.  “These problems call into question Groupon’s valuation,” said Harvard Business School associate professor Ben Edelman. “With competitors and regulators nipping at Groupon’s heels, the company may be worth less than their prospectus suggests.”  A Groupon spokesman said the company is planning on “working with regulators to explain our business model and practices,” but declined to comment on competition.  The daily deal industry may generate as much as $6.1 billion in annual gross revenue by 2015, up from $873 million last year, according to BIA/Kelsey, which tracks local advertising.  That growth potential has attracted a lot of new entrants. New York-based Yipit tracks more than 400 U.S. daily deal websites, up from about 20 in early 2010, said data product manager David Sinsky.  “In the last 12 months, there’s been an explosion in the quantity of competitors,” Sinsky said. “In the next 12 months, the quality of competition will increase.”  AT&T, MasterCard, Google and Facebook will be the biggest threats to Groupon, he said.  Amazon.com Inc started offering daily deals last month through its AmazonLocal service. The Internet retailer sources most of the deals from LivingSocial, Groupon’s closest competitor. Amazon bought part of LivingSocial in late 2010.  American Express Co said on Tuesday it would offer deals to card members in a partnership with Facebook.  AT&T Interactive, which runs the telephone company’s online yellow pages business, introduced daily deals in Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth and Los Angeles on Monday.  To source daily deals, the company is using “a fraction” of its roughly 5,000-member sales force, which sells yellow pages ads and other marketing services to local merchants, said AT&T Interactive Chief Executive Officer David Krantz.  “We’re able to self-fund and start this thing from existing resources,” he added.  By contrast, Groupon has spent heavily to recruit thousands of sales people in the past year.  Groupon is still the clear leader with 48 percent of the daily deal market, according to Yipit data for May, but that is down from 52 percent in April. Meanwhile, LivingSocial’s share rose to 24 percent from 20 percent.  Competition has already affected Groupon’s operations, Yipit’s Sinsky said.  Subscriber acquisition costs rose almost threefold in the first quarter from a year earlier, while the cost of attracting Groupon-buying customers jumped fourfold, according data in the company’s IPO filing.  And while the number of vouchers sold rose to about 28 million from 1.76 million, they fell on a per-subscriber basis to 0.42 from 0.67, data from the filing show.  Groupon typically takes 50 percent of revenue generated from deals, while merchants take the rest. But the company’s share has started slipping with the entry of rivals such as Google, whose commission is only in the mid-30 percent range, Sinsky noted.  Regulation may also change the way Groupon operates.  The main question is whether states decide Groupon’s deals are gift certificates, which are subject to expiration rules.  Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen said last week that Groupon’s daily deals could violate a state law that prohibits expiration dates on gift certificates.  California also bans expiration dates on gift certificates. Under Massachusetts law, gift certificates are good for seven years.  Groupon deals usually last a year or less. If the company has to extend expiration dates, merchants might be less willing to sign up for deals, it warned in its IPO filing. Groupon would be on the hook to pay merchants for a longer time, increasing its liabilities.  Some U.S. states and overseas jurisdictions require money on unused gift certificates to go to the government. Groupon said it did not turn those funds over now, but warned that a successful challenge to its position could also increase liabilities.

24,AXP,Lazard hires ex-UBS financial services banker Howe," * Howe to head North America financial services   * Howe left UBS in May, was co-head FIG, Americas   By Paritosh Bansal   NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N) said on Monday it hired former UBS AG UBSN.VX investment banker Gary Howe as head of financial institutions advisory in North America.   Howe, who will be based in New York, was previously co-head of UBS financial institutions group in the Americas. He left UBS in May and has been on leave in between jobs.   UBS has seen scores of investment bankers leave in the last three years as the financial crisis hit the Swiss bank hard and forced it to put unpopular curbs on compensation.   UBS has, however, been hiring bankers to rebuild its ranks. Separately on Monday, UBS said it had hired Michael Konigsberg, a former Barclays Capital (BARC.L) banker, as Americas head of leveraged finance. [ID:nN1E76O18Q]   Lazard said Howe’s appointment was effective immediately.   Howe, a South African native, joined UBS in 2005 after nine years at Credit Suisse First Boston, and has advised on a wide range of financial services transactions.   In recent years, his M&A deals include Butterfield Bank’s $550 million recapitalization by Carlyle Group and other investors, and American Express Co’s (AXP.N) $1.1 billion acquisition of General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Corporate Payment Services.   He also advised Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) on several transactions, including its exit from the U.S. government’s bailout program, an $18.8 billion equity transaction and the placement of $3 billion of its China Construction Bank Corp (601939.SS) stake.

25,AXP,"American Express, Verizon in mobile payments deal","   * Deal involves pre-loading of Serve app on Verizon phones   * Separate deal to Amex/Isis pact for in-store payments   NEW YORK, Aug 1 (Reuters) - American Express Co (AXP.N) is teaming up with No. 1 U.S. mobile service Verizon Wireless to offer online and person-to-person payments in the credit card company’s latest effort to expand in the mobile payments business.   The partnership comes weeks after American Express announced a deal with Sprint (S.N). The credit card company also recently unveiled a separate agreement with Isis, Verizon’s mobile payments venture.   Under the latest agreement, Verizon Wireless will pre-load many of its smartphones with the American Express “Serve” application, which will allow Verizon customers to make online payments by typing in their phone number and a personal identification number instead of having to type out their credit card number.   Serve allows individuals to pay one another with no transaction fees, and also comes with a card that can be used to pay any merchant that accepts American Express.   The Serve platform allows American Express to attract to its payments network customers who usually pay with cash, checks, and debit cards.   American Express built its Serve business on the foundation of Revolution Money, a company launched by Steve Case’s Revolution LLC that American Express acquired in early 2010. Steve Case is a co-founder of America Online.   Isis, which will introduce services in 2012, is a venture of Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc (T.N) and T-Mobile USA, a unit of Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE). Verizon Wireless is a joint venture between Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L).   The separate Isis partnership is designed to allow in-store payments where consumers will be able to wave their phone at the check-out terminal to pay.

31,AXP,Dealtalk: Goldman helps AmEx take sting out of ICBC stake,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - When Goldman Sachs (GS.N) executed a $479 million block share sale in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (1398.HK) this week to help American Express Inc (AXP.N) hedge its position in the Chinese lender, a wall of mystery surrounded the transaction.  Though the deal value wasn’t huge, what sparked interest in it was the involvement of three large global and publicly traded institutions: ICBC, the world’s biggest bank by market value, Goldman, one of the world’s most influential securities firms, and American Express, another large U.S. bank making huge strides into China.  Furthermore, this could be a way for institutional or strategic investors to take short-term directional bets on Chinese banks without necessarily having to offload their positions and ruffling feathers.  The deal underscored the sensitivities and challenges of dealmaking in China. Before going through with its plan, American Express assured ICBC (601398.SS) that it wants to retain its stake, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  Typically, the sale of large strategic stakes is executed via block deals wherein underwriters take the chunk of shares to be sold on their books and then sell it to fund managers or other institutional investors.  When American Express concluded it was time to lock in profits from its $200 million pre-IPO investment in ICBC, it decided to take a less trodden path.  The move to not dump in the market the 638.06 million shares, equivalent to a 0.74 percent stake in ICBC’s Hong Kong-listed shares, could have been guided by political sensitivities, sources said. Creating a hedge will also limit American Express’s capital requirements under Basel III.  “If AmEx can show that it is fully hedged and there is no market risk, then they don’t have to include it in their risk-weighted assets,” one banking analyst said.  The deal comes at a time when analysts and ratings agencies such as Moody’s Investors Service have raised concerns about Chinese banks’ exposure to poor-quality local government debt.  The solution was to structure a hedge, enabling American Express to keep its ICBC stake. Details of the deal weren’t entirely clear, but one source said American Express could have bought a put option from Goldman Sachs.  A put option gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified amount of shares at a specified time.  Late on Monday, Goldman launched a block deal to sell 638.06 million ICBC shares. The term sheet named Goldman Sachs International as the seller, but added it was acting “as a hedge for a third-party client facilitation transaction.”  Some sources said it would have been easier for Goldman Sachs to execute such a deal because it had more than enough shares of ICBC to lend to American Express.  Goldman sold the shares to offset the long position created by the transaction. When the contract expires, Goldman will have to buy back the same number of shares from the market so that it is not left with a short position on its book.  At the end of the transaction, American Express will continue to own the stake in ICBC, but it is totally immune to the market fluctuations. ICBC shares are down 2.8 percent this year, adding to last year’s 8.4 percent fall.  Both Goldman and AmEx declined to comment.  “The benefit of such a structure is that Amex could limit any downside in the stock,” one person, who was not involved with the deal, said. The person has previously worked on structured transactions.  American Express paid $200 million to buy 1.28 billion Hong Kong shares of ICBC in 2006 as part of a group of strategic investors before ICBC’s IPO. When the lock-up expired in April 2009, American Express sold half its stake for some $310 million. The latest transaction would help American Express to reap about five times the return on its initial investment.  American Express wanted to lock in the tidy return before sentiment for Chinese bank stocks deteriorated further.  Chinese bank shares have been under pressure partly on concerns of slowing loan growth and mounting worries about bad debts. Last month, Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings TEM.UL sold $3.6 billion worth of stakes in two of China’s top-four banks.  With China offering huge potential, American Express was careful not to send out the wrong message with the transaction, even though the deal was small.  “They are not going to be on the good graces of the regulators if they were to divest their entire stake in ICBC,” the bank analyst said.

Chinese bank shares have been under pressure partly on concerns of slowing loan growth and mounting worries about bad debts. Last month, Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings  sold $3.6 billion worth of stakes in two of China’s top-four banks.

33,AXP,China's ICBC to take over Standard Bank Argentina,"HONG KONG/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (1398.HK) is to pay $600 million to take control of the Argentina operations of South Africa’s Standard Bank (SBKJ.J), it said on Friday, becoming the first Chinese lender to enter Latin America’s third-largest economy.  ICBC, the world’s biggest bank by market value, will take 80 percent of commercial lender Standard Bank Argentina and its two affiliates, asset manager Standard Investments and Inversora Diagnol, a commercial service provider.  The deal highlights the booming growth of Chinese finance in emerging markets beyond Asia. ICBC has been the top shareholder in Standard Bank since 2008, and is looking to benefit more as Chinese corporates extend their reach into Africa and other frontier markets.  “Chinese government policy probably had some influence on ICBC’s decision. When you look at the other Chinese banks, none of them are doing acquisitions like ICBC is,” said Ivan Li, an analyst at Kim Eng Securities in Hong Kong.  “China is probably treating ICBC like its flagship and wants it to expand everywhere.”  Johannesburg-based Standard will reduce its stake in all three firms to 20 percent. It owns 75 percent of Standard Bank Argentina, which it acquired in 2007 for $120 million, and 70 percent in the other two units.  Minority shareholders in Argentina also agreed to sell their stakes to ICBC.  Standard Bank, Africa’s largest by assets, this year scaled back its overseas strategy to rein in costs and boost its return on equity. The bank said it no longer has ambitions to buy or build commercial banking operations outside of Africa.  In March it sold its stake 36 percent stake in Russia’s Troika Dialog to Sberbank SBER03.MM for $372 million.  “Through hard lessons they’ve realized that it’s very difficult to compete outside of Africa,” said Faizal Moolla, an analyst at Avior Research in Cape Town.  “Africa is where they have the competitive advantage and this is where their bread and butter is made.”  Following the transaction, the Argentine bank will get a $100 million capital injection, of which Standard Bank will pay $20 million. Its net proceeds from the deal will be $380 million.  Standard Bank is not considering any more assets overseas, chief executive Jacko Maree told a conference call, including its Turkish unit, Standard Unlu.  He also said the bank aimed to be more than a “passive investor” in Argentina, and aimed to use its remaining stake to continue to do deals between Africa and Latin America.  “It enables us to still have a connection to Argentina. I think ICBC are very keen for us to partner with them in Argentina, they clearly don’t have any expertise in the country,” Maree said.  Standard Bank Argentina’s chairman, Myles Ruck, said the South African bank was “almost spoiled for choice,” having received about 10 offers from Argentine and overseas banks for the units.  The deal gives ICBC a full-service commercial bank and 103 branches in a country where China is the second-largest trading partner and no other Chinese banks have a presence.  “ICBC has a much larger balance sheet and will be able to take the business to a new dimension... It givest them first-mover advantage,” said Avior’s Moolla.  Argentina’s center-left president, Cristina Fernandez, met with ICBC officials in Buenos Aires and said she asked the bank to present an investment plan to her government.  “We want investment but investment for the real economy, investment that will generate production, investment that sustains growth for Argentines,” Fernandez said in a televised speech.  Shares of ICBC fell more than 3 percent in Hong Kong trade while Standard Bank dropped 1.6 percent in Johannesburg by 1053 GMT, as both were hit by the global sell-off in equity markets.

38,AXP,"Obama, CEOs talk markets, global economy woes","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Global financial upheaval was on the agenda on Friday when President Barack Obama met with top executives from the U.S. business community, the White House said.  Chief executives from Johnson & Johnson, Wells Fargo & Co, U.S. Bank, Xerox Corp, BlackRock Inc, Silver Lake Partners, American Express and U.S. Steel all met with Obama to discuss the economy and the president’s plans to create jobs.  Obama held his latest in a series of talks with Big Business against the backdrop of a euro zone debt crisis that has hit financial markets worldwide, adding to investor anxiety in the aftermath of last week’s U.S. credit downgrade.  Before Friday’s session which included major players from the financial sector, the White House said market turmoil and economic troubles around the world would be among the issues discussed, along with the U.S. economy and job creation.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest denied the meeting was called in reaction to market and global concerns but said: “They’ll certainly talk about these issues, about the market reaction here.”  The meeting came at the end of a volatile week. U.S. stocks rose on Friday as mildly upbeat retail sales data offset a closely watched barometer showing U.S. consumer sentiment at its lowest point in more than three decades.  European stock markets also gained despite continued concern about French banks’ exposure to European debt woes.  Critics have complained that Obama has failed to reassure Americans as markets whipsawed this week, in one of the most dramatic periods in the stock market since he took office amid the financial crisis in January 2009.  He said on Thursday that Europe’s debt troubles were among the global challenges weighing on the struggling U.S. recovery, but the White House said the administration remained confident in European leaders’ ability to handle the situation.  Obama’s hopes for re-election in 2012 will likely hinge on his success in lowering unemployment, currently pinned above 9 percent, boosting sluggish growth and restoring confidence lost from the Standard & Poor’s downgrade and fractious debt talks.  White House meetings with executives have become almost routine as Obama has courted business leaders while seeking to cast himself as more of a centrist.

40,AXP,"Dealtalk: Undervalued, NetSpend may be scooped up","BANGALORE (Reuters) - Less than a year since it went public, NetSpend Holdings Inc’s depressed stock price and cut-throat competition in the pre-paid debit card market make it a potential takeout target.  Pre-paid cards — targeted at low income and under-banked customers — grew significantly during the economic downturn, but the card market is now over-crowded and has attracted regulatory scrutiny, priming the sector for consolidation.  Credit card giant American Express and payment processor MasterCard have both entered the pre-paid debit card space, and other financial companies are taking a close look, hoping to tap a broad source of fee-income, but making competition tougher.  Shares in NetSpend, which has lost some distribution partners and seen slower take-up of its cards, have spent most of the past six months below its $204 million October IPO price of $11. The stock price this month dipped below $4 to a life-low.  “NetSpend could be a strategic fit for other card companies, a direct competitor, or even private equity,” said Sterne Agee analyst Greg Smith.  The likeliest buyer is Green Dot Corp, NetSpend’s main rival in a U.S. pre-paid debit card market that Mercator Advisory Group forecasts will next year have funds of $118.5 billion — more than treble the 2010 total.  MasterCard recently forecast pre-paid volumes would top $840 billion by 2017.  “Green Dot would be a usual suspect here. I don’t see any reason why these companies should butt heads instead of getting together,” said Darren Chervitz, director of research at Jacob Asset Management, and a former holder of NetSpend stock.  While Green Dot has been insulated from some of the fierce competition due to its relationship with Wal-Mart — which brings in nearly two-thirds of its revenue — the same tie-up also makes it highly dependent on a single customer.  “You have to wonder if that’s a long-term relationship you really want to tie your horse to because, clearly, Walmart has the leverage in that relationship,” Chervitz said.  NetSpend has had some challenges retaining partners, but it does have a more diverse client base. Its largest client, ACE Cash Express, accounted for just a third of its 2010 revenue of $275 million.  “Green Dot is in a position to do a very accretive acquisition given where NetSpend is right now,” said Wedbush analyst Gil Luria said, noting the market is pricing in a possible buy-out of NetSpend.  “The stock has been volatile and, on the days it’s up, it’s my view that people bid it up because they feel the company is going to get sold,” Luria said.  NetSpend may also attract interest from Capital One, which tried to buy the company four years ago, Luria said.  NetSpend’s cheap stock valuation — it trades at 12 times forecast 2012 earnings, compared with 20 times for Green Dot — is likely to attract buyers, but the company may struggle to get what it thinks is the right price.  “I don’t think management would be interested in anything less than a 30-40 percent premium to even get the conversation started,” said Luria at Wedbush.  But the headwinds the company faces may leave it with few bargaining chips, and, while Green Dot’s market value is more than triple NetSpend’s, it’s unlikely to want to offer a big premium.  “I don’t think they’re (NetSpend) in a position to demand too much,” said Chervitz. “If you assume a 20-30 percent premium, you’re starting to come to a comparable valuation, which is like a merger of equals. I’m not sure that’s something Green Dot would want to do.”  If a deal gets done, it could signal a slowdown in growth for the pre-paid card sector as a whole.  “If you saw a deal happen, it’s not a bullish thing,” said Chervitz. “It probably says Green Dot is seeing some of the stress that NetSpend has seen, and sees the need to build up scale inorganically.”  ",8232011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-dealtalk-netspend/dealtalk-undervalued-netspend-may-be-scooped-up-idUSTRE77M5AW20110823

The two banks join second-ranked China Construction Bank  and No.4 Bank of China in unveiling record six-month profits, benefitting from the mainland’s move to raise interest rates and further helped by fast-rising fee income.	   “Going forward, they’re not going to be able to post these type of earnings,” Ken Peng, senior economist at BNP Paribas said. “The regulators are starting to catch onto the types of grey areas in the banking system. Also, interest rates should be normalising.”	   China has been trying to pull back on bank lending by steadily raising interest rates and ordering banks to keep more reserves with the central bank, to keep inflation under control. Rising rates typically improve the margins of banks.	   ICBC and AgBank also dismissed concerns that the massive lending to local government financing vehicles (LGFVs) in 2008 and 2009 could go sour, pointing to their falling non-performing loan ratio as evidence of that.	   ICBC, also the world’s biggest bank by market value, said LGFV loans had an NPL ratio of 0.25 percent, while AgBank said its LGFV loans had an NPL ratio of 1 percent. This is lower than the two banks’ overall bad-loan ratio.	   “I have been asked about LGFV loans so many times I have already memorised my answer,” ICBC’s President Yang Kaisheng told a news conference after the results. “I will say that the risk is manageable, the loans are properly spread out, we have enough provisions, and the assets are of good quality.”	   AgBank had total outstanding LGFV loans of 530 billion yuan, while ICBC’s total outstanding LGFV loans clocked in at 931 billion yuan, according to executives at the two banks. 	   LGFV loans have been highlighted as a possible hotspot for souring loans by China’s banking regulators. Unable to borrow directly from banks, many local governments set up financing vehicles that borrow on their behalf to fund infrastructure projects.   ICBC, in which Goldman Sachs and American Express  hold stakes, reported a January-June net profit of 109.5 billion yuan ($17.14 billion), slightly better than analysts’ expectations for 106.9 billion yuan, according to a Reuters survey of nine analysts.  	   It was also 29.4 percent higher than the 84.6 billion yuan it made the same period last year.	   Net interest margin, which measures the profitability of loans, widened to 2.6 percent from 2.44 percent at the end of 2010. Non-performing loans stood at 0.95 percent, down from 1.08 percent at the end of 2010.	   Helping boost earnings was fee and commission income, which rose 46 percent to 56.8 billion yuan from a year ago. ICBC’s investment banking arm is Hong Kong-based ICBC International, which has snagged several high-profile deals, including Brazilian oil giant Petrobras’ $70 billion share sale.	   AgBank recorded a 66.67 billion yuan profit for January-June, up from 45.8 billion yuan a year earlier. The result was roughly in line an with the average estimate of 67 billion yuan from nine analysts surveyed by Reuters.	   The bank, which was set up in 1951 to fund rural causes, also dismissed concerns that it could soon head for another round of fundraising just a year after its bumper $22 billion IPO in Shanghai and Hong Kong.	   “Of course everyone is concerned if the CBRC hikes capital requirements,” AgBank’s President Zhang Yun said, referring to the China Banking Regulatory Commission. “But for now, all the big banks have high levels of capital and we have no plans for fundraising in the near future.”	   AgBank, whose key investors include sovereign wealth funds such as the Qatar Investment Authority, was sticking to its previously stated plan of having no more equity fundraising for at least three years from its IPO, Zhang added.	   Net interest income for the quarter was 144.7 billion yuan, up 29 percent from a year earlier. Net interest margin was 2.79 percent versus 2.47 percent in the first half of last year. Its non-performing loan ratio stood at 1.67 percent, compared with 2.03 percent a year earlier.	   ICBC shares in Hong Kong ended up 1.9 percent on Thursday, compared with the benchmark Hang Seng Index’s 1.5 percent gain. AgBank shares closed up 0.3 percent.

47,AXP,"TrueCar raises over $200 million in debt, equity"," * Company plans to use proceeds for acquisitions   * Backers include Allen & Co LLC, GSV, Silicon Valley Bank   * Company expects IPO first half of 2012   SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 7 (Reuters) - TrueCar, a company that provides car-sales prices to consumers, has raised over $200 million in debt and equity financing to use for acquisitions and growth, the company said.   The transaction underscores continuing investor enthusiasm for companies that allow consumers to find good buys using the Internet. Daily-deals site Groupon has 115 million subscribers, although it is delaying its $750 million initial public offering.   “We are effectively Groupon for cars,” TrueCar chief executive officer Scott Painter told Reuters. He said it would be difficult for Groupon or any other site to replicate TrueCar’s business because of the complexity involved in collecting all the car-sales data that TrueCar provides.  TrueCar has raised about half its funds in debt and half in equity, Painter said.   Its new equity comes from backers including GR Match, McCombs Family Partners, and DealerTrack, Keating Capital, GSV Asset Management, Passport Capital, International Investment House and Allen & Company LLC.   Silicon Valley Bank arranged the debt portion of the funding for TrueCar, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif.   The company is gearing up for an initial public offering in the first half of next year, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.   TrueCar.com allows consumers to check prices in their area for specific makes and models of cars. Its sister site, ClearBook.com, provides the same service for used cars.   Instead of relying on advertising for revenue, TrueCar takes a cut of the sale when its referral leads to a sale.   A spokesman declined to disclose revenue, but said TrueCar is profitable. Earlier this year, it acquired data-provider ALG, or Automotive Lease Guide, for an undisclosed sum. It also acquired Carperks, an automotive-purchasing and leasing company, for an undisclosed sum.   TrueCar also provides white-label online car purchasing services to partners such as credit card company American Express (AXP.N), car-services provider AAA and insurance-provider USAA. The company said it has driven 350,000 sales since its founding in 2005, including 20,000 last month.

50,AXP,Exclusive: U.S. in criminal probe of eBay employees,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have launched a criminal probe into whether eBay Inc employees took confidential information from classified ad website Craigslist as eBay sought to build a rival service, a copy of a grand jury subpoena obtained by Reuters shows.  The two companies have been feuding for years in civil court over allegations that online giant eBay took a stake in Craigslist and then misappropriated confidential information while it secretly planned its own classifieds site.  The subpoena seeks information regarding several eBay personalities, including founder and Chairman Pierre Omidyar and Joshua Silverman, the former Skype chief executive who served as eBay’s representative on Craigslist’s board.  An eBay spokeswoman, Amanda Miller, said the company would cooperate in any inquiry related to the disputes with Craigslist.  “EBay believes that Craigslist’s allegations against eBay are without merit,” Miller said in an email on Tuesday. “We will continue to vigorously defend ourselves, and we will aggressively pursue our claims against Craigslist.”  EBay shares traded at $29 on Tuesday in after-hours trading, down from their $29.40 close.  Last year, a Delaware’s Chancery Court judge ruled that Craigslist properly removed an eBay representative from its board. The judge also ruled that Craigslist could not dilute eBay’s 28.4 percent stake in the company.  Miller said allegations of misconduct were leveled by Craigslist as a defense in the Delaware case, and the court did not rule in Craigslist’s favor on the defense.  Craigslist representatives did not respond to an email seeking comment.  RJ Hottovy, an equity analyst at Morningstar, said there could be implications for VP-level executives.  “While these are serious allegations, I don’t think it’s too big of a concern for investors,” Hottovy said. “Classifieds are a smaller part of eBay’s business.”  The subpoena — issued by a federal grand jury in San Jose, Calif., last week on behalf of the U.S. Justice Department — seeks an array of information and documents.  Many of the requests in the subpoena match word for word language in another civil lawsuit filed by Craigslist against eBay. That litigation in a San Francisco court is ongoing.  EBay launched classified ad service Kijiji in the United States in 2007.  In 2005, “Omidyar requested information about Craigslist’s approach to adding new cities as well as advance notice of plans to launch in new cities,” the subpoena says, seeking documents about the allegation.  Omidyar could not immediately be reached on Tuesday.  The subpoena also seeks documents about allegations that Silverman provided an eBay employee “with insider information about Craigslist management and provided recommendations to the eBay team responsible for the launch of Kijiji.”  Silverman is currently president of the US Consumer Services business at American Express. He declined to comment through an American Express representative.  It was not clear on Tuesday how many companies or individuals have received subpoenas, and no one has been charged with any criminal wrongdoing. Northern California U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag declined to comment.  The civil case in San Francisco Superior Court is Craigslist Inc. v. eBay Inc. et al., 08-475276.

51,AXP,"Heartland Payment sees growth in market share, margins","(Reuters) - Payment processor Heartland Payment Systems Inc HPY.N sees scope for growing its market share and margins at a time when the sluggish U.S. economy is expected to hurt its larger rivals.  The company, which competes with JPMorgan Chase’s (JPM.N) Chase Paymentech, KKR’s (KKR.N) First Data and Global Payments (GPN.N), caters mainly to small and mid-size merchants, who are doing better even as larger retail chains struggle with a cutback in consumer spending.  “Our business model allows us to make money at pricing levels that we think are challenging to some of our competitors,” said Heartland’s President Robert Baldwin in an interview with Reuters.  “We win some, they win some ... but we think we can take market share from them. Even modest moves in market share are very meaningful to us,” added Baldwin, whose responsibilities cover Heartland’s operations, administrative activities and internal controls.  While the weak U.S. market has forced payment processors to look abroad for growth opportunities and possible acquisitions, Baldwin said Heartland, which has operations in the United States and Canada, has no immediate plans of entering newer markets.  “There’s a ton of opportunity in the United States, and we want to focus on establishing a better share here.”  Heartland’s stock has grown 36 percent over the past one year, outperforming the broader S&P 1500 Data Processing & Outsources Services Sub-Industry Index .15GSPTKDP, which has risen 18 percent in the same period.  Stanford alumnus Baldwin, who served as Heartland’s chief financial officer for over a decade from 2000 to 2011, also said he sees the company’s margins growing over the next few quarters.  “We know we’ll achieve some more savings in the processing and servicing line because of the processing center consolidations that we still have under way, and the remainder is likely to come from our restraint in the G&A line item,” he said.  On a post-earnings call in August, the company said it hoped to complete its transition from 12 centers to 3 centers by mid-2012.  Heartland, which is expected to pass on benefits from lower debit interchange rules to its merchants, should also see better merchant retention in 2011 compared with last year, Baldwin said.  “Merchant retention has been trending better modestly over the last year, basically driven by the fact that we have fewer businesses going out of business,” he added.  On the proposed debit interchange rules, Baldwin said the company would see a lower cost from the reduced interchange, which it would pass on to its merchants, but it was too early to predict the exact outcome and benefits for the company.  Heartland Payment, which was the target of a massive cyber hacking attack in 2008, said issues from the data breach were largely behind them.  The data theft resulted in several lawsuits, including some from major card companies like Visa (V.N), MasterCard (MA.N), American Express (AXP.N) and Discover Financial (DFS.N).  “It’s absolutely way (behind) in our rearview mirror and we feel very good about the future,” Baldwin said.  “There are some things that could reemerge in the future but right now they’re very very quiet.”  ",9212011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-heartlandpayment/heartland-payment-sees-growth-in-market-share-margins-idUSTRE78K65R20110921
52,AXP,Discover Financial beats profit estimates,"(Reuters) - Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) reported higher quarterly profit, topping analysts’ estimates, on increased credit card spending by customers and lower costs for bad loans.  Net income rose to $649 million in the third quarter that ended August 31, from $261 million a year earlier, the Riverwoods, Illinois-based credit card company said on Thursday.  Earnings per share were $1.18, beating analysts’ average estimate of 96 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Discover stock slipped nine cents to close at $25.25 on a day when many financial stocks were down sharply.  “We achieved record results again this quarter as a result of further improvements in credit performance and record sales volume,” Chairman and Chief Executive David Nelms said in the announcement.  The delinquency rate for credit card loans over 30 days past due fell to a new low for the company of 2.43 percent, down from 2.79 percent in the second quarter and 4.39 percent a year earlier.  With the improvement in delinquencies, the company’s expenses for loan losses fell to $100 million, down 86 percent from $713 million a year earlier.  Discover reduced its reserve for credit losses by $359 million in the latest quarter, compared with $187 million a year earlier.  But the boosts from reserve releases are going to fade, executives cautioned after the announcement.  “We believe we have reached the end of the really large reserve releases like the one we had this quarter and the last few quarters,” Nelms said in an interview.  Nelms said that delinquency rates are unlikely to fall much further from their current record lows and that the company will have to make new provisions for losses as its makes new loans.  As a result, Discover will probably start building its loss reserves again in 2012, Chief Financial Officer Mark Graf said on a conference call with analysts.  The shift could be a bad, but inevitable, sign for future earnings reports from banks in general. Bank profits have been lifted for several quarters by reserve releases, which essentially reversed what proved to be excess expenses recorded for bad loans during the recession.  Nelms told Reuters the timing for the end of releases at other lenders will likely vary because of their different mixes of loans. Discover lends mostly on credit cards.  The trailing off of the accounting lift will put more pressure on financial firms to increase their businesses profitably, which is what Discover did in the third quarter. Sales on its credit cards increased 9 percent from a year earlier to $26.3 billion and were up from $24.8 billion in the second quarter.  The company said card volume rose because increased spending by new and existing customers and higher gas prices.  Interest yield on card accounts slipped 0.4 percentage points from a year earlier to 12.46 percent because of new restrictions from federal CARD Act, an increase in promotional rates and the fact that more customers are paying their balances in full.  Graf said the company’s profits from interest will benefit from a “tailwind” of lower funding costs in 2012 as it replaces deposits taken two or three years ago with new deposits at lower current rates.  Discover said it bought back 8.4 million of its shares, or 1.5 percent, in the third quarter for $198 million.  Through Wednesday, the company’s shares were up more than 36 percent this year.

58,AXP,Insight: Chase's card chief rebuilds business part by part,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Gordon Smith, credit card chief of JPMorgan Chase, often spends his weekends at his northern New Jersey home, rebuilding the engines of vintage cars.  As he takes apart an engine, he puts pieces in plastic Ziploc bags to keep track of where they belong. He videotapes the disassembly, in case he forgets how to rebuild.  “It would be really embarrassing to take a pile of pieces back to the shop and say, ‘I took it apart. I’m an office worker. Could you put it back together for me?” Smith quipped in an English accent in a recent interview.  Smith is using that same careful approach to rebuild Chase’s credit card unit. And the model he is using resembles that of American Express Co.  Smith, who joined Chase in 2007 after 26 years at American Express, took over operations of a travel agency in JPMorgan’s private equity unit, allowing him to offer better travel rewards and a better corporate card.  He built up the bank’s Paymentech unit, which processes card transactions for merchants. He created the Sapphire card for wealthier customers whose big spending earns him more processing fees.  Smith is also applying several lessons taken from the consumer finance industry’s playbook: improving customer service, combining many rewards programs into one and shedding cards that are not profitable enough. Along the way, he is spending hundreds of millions of dollars mailing card offers.  Step back and look at what Smith is building, and it looks a lot like American Express: a business that caters to rich clients and relies increasingly on processing fees to make money.  That has made American Express the most consistently profitable of the major financial services companies, outpacing more glamorous businesses like Goldman Sachs Group Inc in recent years in return on equity. (Please see graph: link.reuters.com/bym24s )  There’s big risk in this strategy for Smith, though, and at stake is more than his 1969 Jaguar XK-E or his 1972 Triumph TR6. Credit card companies have tried to follow American Express’s strategy for years and have failed.  Chase starts with some big disadvantages. Although its Paymentech processes transactions for merchants, it does not run the Visa or Mastercard global networks that accept its cards and influence how much it can charge for credit card transactions.  American Express runs its own network, which allows it to charge merchants a higher price for delivering wealthy clients. American Express can earn more on transactions than Chase.  But Chase’s credit card business is second in size only to American Express’s, and contributed 12 percent of JPMorgan’s $17.4 billion of profits last year. If Smith pulls off the transformation, the rewards could be handsome.  Some analysts believe he is among a small group of potential successors to Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, even though the 53-year-old Smith is just 2-1/2 years younger than Dimon, 55.  “Smith would do well with even larger responsibilities in the company. He’s a very talented executive,” said Moshe Orenbuch, a veteran industry analyst at Credit Suisse.  Jamie Dimon in an interview said Smith is “an extraordinary executive on multiple levels.”  Dimon has given Smith more responsibility in recent months, including oversight of JPMorgan’s auto finance and student lending business, and responsibility for marketing the Chase retail banking brand and shaping up Chase’s information networks.  Smith is making progress. Profits have recovered under his watch. He’s improved the bank’s customer service rankings for credit cards, and he is getting ahead of competitors who also issue MasterCard and Visa cards.  “Chase is taking share of big spenders who previously had loyalty to other issuers,” said David Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, which publishes news and research on consumer payment systems.  Robertson says that since Smith arrived, Chase seized 1.15 percentage points of market share while Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc each lost more than one point.  Boosting market share in consumer finance businesses is usually a game of inches.  “That is a huge change,” Dimon said.  Smith, who grew up in the quiet coastal town of Peacehaven in southeast England, says he owes some of his success to his training as a computer programer, which taught him to focus on details as well as the broader picture.  “When you are doing systems work, you have to take a high-level view of what you want to do, and you have to turn it into lines of code that will actually do something,” said Smith, whose first job at American Express was programing.  Smith is doing some heavy rewriting of Chase’s code after expenses for losses on card balances reached an astounding $18.5 billion in 2009.  That coupled with a grim outlook for lending spurred Smith to scale down risk by extending less credit to customers who carry more than $20,000 of debt on all their cards. Within two years, balances of such higher-risk customers were down by 40 percent.  He has also cut card loans outstanding by 20 percent to $125.6 billion in June from $157 billion at the end of 2007.  Smith still likes interest income when he can get it safely. He created a product he calls Blueprint, an online budgeting program to support customers who will occasionally use their cards to borrow, with plans to pay back what they owe.  As he reduces credit risk, he is boosting profits by processing transactions, a move that Dimon supports.  Every time a customer spends on a credit card, the bank that issues the card earns, on average, about 1.75 percentage points of the transaction as a fee, according to Credit Suisse’s Orenbuch.  In Smith’s most-recently reported quarter, the take helped push his fee revenue to nearly 40 percent as much as his interest income, nearly twice the proportion as in 2007.  And now that Chase is making fewer dubious loans that require big loss provisions, Smith’s bottom line is rising again. Return on equity in the unit rose to 35 percent in the first half of this year from 1 percent in the first half of 2010. The company has told analysts to generally expect 20 percent returns on equity.  The first half of 2011 may be unusually high for return on equity because the firm’s delinquencies fell precipitously.  Every morning at 9 a.m., Smith has some 500 managers on a conference call for 30 minutes to review calls from customers.  They receive basic information about a client or two, listen to the interactions and discuss how the process could have gone better.  Smith pushes his staff to recognize what he calls customer “moments of truth,” experiences that define how cardholders think about Chase.  One is when someone loses a card and needs a replacement immediately. (Smith has a team to get new cards to remote locations.) Another is when suspicious charges appear on accounts and must be discussed.  One lesson Smith and his executives have taken from these calls is how much customers hate to be transferred.  “You hear the tone from the customer drop when that happens,” Smith said. “As soon as you get to that first transfer, customer satisfaction begins to drop, even though the problem gets resolved.”  His response: train representatives to solve more problems themselves. It’s a logical answer, but not an easy task given that Chase has 12,000 people taking calls and answering mail.  Chase’s standing with customers improved more than that of the industry last year, said Michael Beird, director of banking services for research firm J.D. Power.  But Smith needs a lot of those kinds of fixes to make more progress in customer service and loyalty for Chase, particularly with competitors trying to improve their game.  Chase ranks only about average in credit card customer satisfaction, behind top-ranked American Express and the slightly lower-ranked Discover Financial Services, according to J.D. Power.  Smith, said Nilson’s Robertson, is trying to create something many people doubt can exist: good service from a big bank.  Smith has been spending a lot of money on marketing and the bank’s rewards program. Since 2008, the bank’s annual spending on marketing has risen nearly 40 percent.  The unit’s overhead, including marketing expenses, reached 41 percent of revenue at the end of the quarter in June, up from 31 percent in 2008.  He increased marketing spending at the end of 2009 when he rolled out his new products with mailings and broadcast advertising. The new products included the Sapphire Card, the INK card for small businesses and other card accounts with new rewards programs.  Chase has pushed the industry to send out more mail for new accounts and aggressively offer customers cash back for their rewards points. He has promoted additional perks, such as the transferring rewards to airline frequent-flyer accounts, point-for-point.  That has raised concerns among stock analysts about how far industry-wide spending and price-cutting might go.  “Chase has really kick-started the mailbox,” said Andrew Davidson, senior vice president of research firm Mintel Comperemedia.  In the second quarter of this year, card companies sent nearly 1.3 billion new account offers to U.S. addresses, up from about 850 million a year earlier, said Davidson.  Citibank this year has followed Chase’s lead and now the two banks are responsible for most of the mail, said Davidson.  Cardholder spending on new Chase accounts came in 53 percent higher in the last quarter of 2010 compared with a year before. Now Smith has to make sure he holds onto those gains to get the real payoff from all his spending.  Dimon says he is confident in the investments.  “In the recession, Gordon and I saw eye-to-eye,” Dimon said. “We are going to run this company for the future ... and we had lost so much money, nobody is going to notice an extra couple of hundred million dollars.”  Every credit card company from Capital One Financial Corp to Bank of America to Citigroup wants wealthy clients because they are a low credit risk and they spend a lot.  Companies try to woo them with lagniappes galore: rewards programs, sign-up bonuses and so on. The strategy is easy to conceive, but hard to execute profitably.  Bank of America invented what is now the Visa card in the late 1950’s as a replacement for the credit that local drugstores and grocers offered their customers.  For most banks, lending through credit cards is in their DNA, but with weak demand, it’s not the source of profits it used to be.  “People have been nipping at American Express’s heels for a decade, off and on,” said Brad Ball, an analyst at investment bank Evercore. “Some have been somewhat successful, but arguably American Express is a premium product with a premium customer and a premium brand, so they can have premium pricing.”  Smith over time can make his business look more like American Express’s, but without a network, he may never be able to fully duplicate it, analysts said.  He has considered purchasing or building one, but the only network that any company could realistically buy, namely Discover Financial Services, is not as globally available as Visa and Mastercard.  Clients care most about their cards being accepted in as many places as possible, Smith said. “We obviously think about these things a lot, but that would really be the challenge, and it would be a tough one.” (Reporting by David Henry and Dan Wilchins in New York.

62,AXP,Americans not spooked by the economy for Halloween,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A stalled economy hasn’t spooked Americans out of enjoying Halloween. Nearly three-quarters of U.S. consumers plan to celebrate, but will spend less this year on costumes and candy. Although more people will be taking part in Halloween, the biggest non-gift giving holiday in the United States, this year than last, they will be economizing. The average spend is expected to be $53, down from $73 in 2010, according to the American Express Spending & Savings Tracker. Candy and decorations for parties and costumes will account for the biggest outlay, particularly among young professionals, who are expected to spend between $63 to $80 dressing up. “There is no doubt that consumers are watching their wallets. But we know that they are taking part in Halloween and I think it is because Halloween is an experiential holiday,” said Melanie Backs, manager of public affairs at American Express. About 41 million children, aged five to 14 years old, went trick-or-treating last year, U.S. Census Bureau data showed. But young and older children and adults also take part in the holiday which dates back thousands of years to Celtic rituals. “Halloween has evolved from being a one-night event mostly focused on kids trick-or-treating to a full season. We’re seeing candy and decorations on sale in late August,” said Backs. About 70 percent of U.S. consumers will spend an average of $28 on candy and decorations. And it wouldn’t be Halloween without a pumpkin, which will set back consumers about $18, according the American Express. “It (the pumpkin) is the second most important Halloween tradition for many people,” said Backs, adding that candy and decorations is first. Although still primarily a children’s holiday, young adults are also getting into the spirit. Ghosts, goblins and witches are usually top selling costumes for children and adults, but searches on Yahoo.com revealed some unusual choices this year. Yahoo said actor Charlie Sheen, whose highly publicized departure from the hit TV series “Two and a Half Men” kept him in the headlines, was among the years’ most controversial costume searches. “I heard Charlie Sheen will be a favorite one this year,” said Backs. “There is also my personal favorite. I’ve been seeing Angry Bird costumes for both children and adults online,” said Backs, referring to the popular video game. The National Retail Federation predicts the top costume for young girls for the seventh consecutive year will be princesses, and thanks to the popularity of Johnny Depp’s portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow, pirates for boys. Animal and bug costumes are also expected to be a hit. Las Vegas, New York and San Francisco are the favorite cities for people traveling on Halloween, according to American Express. But most people prefer to stay close to home and many will be visiting ghostly houses and spooky theme parks. The haunted attraction industry, which is worth approximately $6 billion and includes 2,500 attractions worldwide, is betting on a good year. “We’re hearing from haunted house attractions around the country that they are doing well,” said Patrick Konopelski, the president of the Haunted Attraction Association (HAA), which has haunts in every U.S. state. “What affects us more than the economy is the weather. When the weather is just right we do very, very well.” The midwest and northeast are the areas of the country where haunted attractions dominate. One of the most popular is Eastern State Penitentiary, which bills itself as a massive haunted house in a real prison that was abandoned 40 years ago. “People want to come out and have a good time — to be scared or watch their friends be scared. Usually right after the fear or the fear there is a lot of laughter,” said Konopelski.",10172011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-halloween-spending/americans-not-spooked-by-the-economy-for-halloween-idUSTRE79G3M720111017
63,AXP,Flash sales pioneer Vente-Privee targets U.S.,"PARIS (Reuters) - Vente-Privee, the French start-up that pioneered the now much-imitated model of on-line flash sales, plans to launch its U.S. website by mid-November in partnership with American Express and aims to reach $500 million in sales in the ultra-competitive market in the next five years. Founder and Chief Executive Jacques-Antoine Granjon told Reuters the joint venture with the credit card group would give Vente-Privee access to an affluent client base of 40 million card holders, giving it instant credibility and brand recognition despite not being a household name outside Europe. But success in the U.S. is far from certain. Vente-Privee is arriving years after imitators of its flash-sales model such as Gilt Groupe and Rue La La, and also faces e-commerce giants such as Amazon, which recently launched a daily deal service hawking local merchants and restaurants. Unlike in France where sales are limited legally to twice-yearly set periods, U.S. consumers are used to getting deep price cuts on merchandise in factory outlet stores and discount chains such as T.J. Maxx and Marshalls. “The U.S. market is a difficult one where discounting is already very common, so we will have our work cut out for us,” said Granjon, whose wavy long hair and habitual uniform of jeans and chunky silver skull-shaped rings belie his status as one of France’s most respected entrepreneurs. “But we have big ambitions, and if we have the right offering and excellent brands, things will take off quickly.” To conquer the U.S., Granjon said Vente-Privee would stick closely to its formula of selling luxury goods to price-conscious fashionistas in two- to six-day sales, while helping major brands like Armani and Diesel liquidate unsold stock. The approach has put the decade-old company on track to hit more than 1 billion euros in sales this year and turned it into one of Europe’s biggest homegrown on-line retailers with a presence in six countries, including France, Germany, Spain, the UK and, from next week, the Netherlands. Vente-Privee, which has been profitable since 2004, has also been the subject of frequent speculation about an initial public offering or a takeover by a U.S. giant like Amazon. Granjon dismissed both scenarios, saying the company could afford to expand abroad without outside funds given its 150 million euros in cash and healthy 7 percent profit margins. “I’ve never raised money and I don’t need to now,” he said. Granjon and the other founders own 80 percent of the group, which was valued at about 1 billion euros ($1.38) when U.S. private equity fund Summit Partners took a 20 percent stake in 2007 and could be worth three times that, according to analysts. But the e-retailer has so far struggled to replicate its success beyond France, where it earns more than three-quarters of sales, and has seen its model cloned by rivals like Spain’s Privalia, Germany’s Brands4Friends and the UK’s Brand Alley. Vente-Privee hopes to buck that trend in the United States by teaming up with American Express. After more than a year of negotiations, the two agreed in March to invest $15-20 million each in the joint venture. Soon after, they hired former Google executive Mike Steib to run the business and are on track to hire some 200 staffers for the New York headquarters by Christmas. The company has a batch of 30 flash sales ready for the upcoming launch of the U.S. site, Granjon said. Especially in the first few months, Granjon said Vente-Privee would showcase fashion from top brands to win the loyalty of new consumers. The company must also convince U.S. companies to sell unsold inventory on the site at a time when competition for such stock is intensifying. Granjon said the company planned to draw on the strong ties it already has with European brands such as Spanish shoemaker Camper and Italian designer clothes company Diesel, as well as signing up major U.S. retailers like the Gap. Asked what brands he was targeting, he referred to downtown Manhattan’s Soho district: “Think of the square of streets down there between Houston and Canal and West Broadway and Lafayette. I want all the brands that are there.” In a separate interview, Vente-Privee’s Steib said the site would offer 60-65 percent discounts on average and estimated such private sales in the U.S. would be a $1.5 billion market this year and grow to $5-6 billion in the next five years.

64,AXP,UPDATE 4-American Express posts higher Q3 net income,"* EPS of $1.03 vs. Street view of $0.96 * Total expenses up about 13 pct, revenue up 9 pct * Shares dip after hours By Joe Rauch Oct 19 (Reuters) - American Express Co posted higher-than-expected quarterly net earnings as cardholders spent more, but expenses grew faster than revenue. The charge- and credit card company spent 24 percent more on its rewards program during the quarter, its third consecutive quarter of boosting its spending on rewards. The rewards expense helped lift the company’s overall costs excluding interest and credit by 13 percent, outpacing its 9 percent revenue growth, after interest expense. But the company’s investments in rewards programs may be boosting customer spending on American Express cards. The number of American Express cards worldwide rose 8 percent and customers charged 12 percent more to those cards than last year. The total number of cards rose to 95.8 million from 89 million a year prior, and average spending per card rose 12 percent to $3,739. “The revenue growth was strong and credit did well, but expenses were up,” said Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. “When they have excess earnings power, they tend to reinvest for the future, and I think that’s what you’re seeing this quarter.” Chief Financial Officer Daniel Henry said the company plans to rein in expenses in the coming quarters and the company has focused its expenditures in areas that generate revenues. The New York-based company said third-quarter net income rose to $1.2 billion, or $1.03 per share, from $1.1 billion, or 90 cents per share, a year ago. That was above analysts’ average estimate of earnings of 96 cents per share on a net basis, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue, net of interest expenses, rose 9 percent to $7.57 billion. But membership rewards costs rose 24 percent to $1.57 billion, bringing total expenses to $5.61 billion, up 13 percent from the same quarter last year. The redemption rate for rewards remained steady at 92 percent, Henry said, remaining steady for the last three quarters. But he characterized the quarter as a “rounding down” on the redemption rate and that it was trending towards 93 percent. Compensation also jumped, rising 18 percent to $1.6 billion. Henry said American Express was hiring additional people, but the rising quarterly compensation also included merit and incentive pay increases. The company’s return on average equity, a measure of how well it wrings profit from its equity, was 27.8 percent during the quarter, up from 25.9 percent in the same quarter last year. Many big Wall Street banks are generating returns on equity in the mid-teens, or below. The increases in expenses, however, were offset by a drop in credit costs and rising revenues. American Express’ provision for loan losses dropped 33 percent year-over-year to $249 million, as the company set aside 82 percent less for card member loans from a year prior. The company’s writeoffs are now near historic lows, Henry said, and that will likely rise in coming quarters. Henry said the company is not managing to minimize losses, but instead focused on the optimal return from its card business. He noted writeoffs will increase over time from their current level of 1.8 percent. With the enactment of the Durbin amendment’s cap on debit card fees on Oct. 1, some banks have introduced debit card fees that some analysts have speculated would lead to customers using credit and prepaid cards more. Henry said it was too soon to note whether customers were using their credit cards more for purchases due to debit fees, or whether American Express’ prepaid cards were seeing more activity. American Express’s shares fell 1 percent to $45.65 in after hours trading compared with their close of $46.13.",10192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/americanexpress/update-4-american-express-posts-higher-q3-net-income-idUSN1E79I1VY20111019
65,AXP,UPDATE 1-American Express exec says mobile wallet growing,"* Mobile payments will reach “tipping point” in 3-5 years * Brick-and-mortar retailers can offer targeted deals * American Express will do small deals to grow mobile Nov 15 (Reuters) - U.S. consumers’ adoption of so-called digital wallets will allow brick-and-mortar retailers to better compete with their online rivals, an American Express Co executive said on Tuesday. Dan Schulman, American Express’ group president for enterprise growth, said with a digital wallet, retailers can provide customers with more targeted deals that until now have mainly been offered by online retailers. The use of smartphones for everyday purchases will reach a “tipping point” within three to five years, Schulman said in a speech at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch financial services conference. Digital payments — rather than using credit or debit cards — have become an increasingly competitive field as more consumers use smartphones capable of processing transactions. American Express, unlike other credit card companies, operates its own payments network, and is joining a growing group of competitors vying for processing digital wallet transactions. Schulman oversees American Express’ new digital wallet initiative, known as Serve. To build the unit, Schulman said American Express would consider select small acquisitions.",11152011,http://www.reuters.com/article/americanexpress-digital/update-1-american-express-exec-says-mobile-wallet-growing-idUSN1E7AE1IC20111115

67,AXP,New York waiters busted for stealing credit card numbers,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Seven waiters at New York’s top steakhouses were busted for stealing the American Express card numbers of rich customers and using them to buy luxury goods, authorities said on Friday. High-tech “skimmers” — hard to detect because they fit into the palm of a hand — captured customers’ credit card numbers at high-end restaurants in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, including Smith & Wollensky’s and the Capital Grille, according to indictments unveiled by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance. The two indictments, with a total of 172 criminal counts, detailed the scheme run by the 28-member ring, which included seven waiters, 10 shoppers, several organizers and a handful of customers who bought the luxury goods knowing they were stolen. The cards targeted were those with a high-limit or unlimited American Express credit cards. These included the famed “black card,” which ensured that the ring could make purchases without fear of automatic red flags with American Express, said New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. After the waiters skimmed the credit cards, the numbers were then used to manufacture phony credit cards, complete with embossed numbers and the names of the customers whose cards were skimmed, investigators said. An army of shoppers equipped with the cards — and in some cases, matching fraudulent driver’s licenses — were sent to stores such as Jimmy Choo, Cartier and Neiman Marcus to purchase handbags, shoes and other items, according to the indictments. The items were resold for profit. Search warrants executed Thursday at a storage unit in midtown Manhattan and other locations turned up more than $1 million worth of watches and more than $1.2 million in cash, among other items, authorities said. The charges range from grand larceny to enterprise corruption, New York State’s equivalent of racketeering. The alleged ringleader, Luis Damian Jacas, 41, faces more than 135 felony counts in all. “Every day, hard-working New Yorkers find themselves the victim of identity theft,” Vance said at a press conference. “It can take years for those individuals to have their credit restored.” The 18-month investigation was conducted by the Secret Service, the New York Police Department and the Manhattan district attorney’s office and included wiretapping phones, monitoring email accounts, analyzing financial records, and tailing shoppers, Vance said.

69,AXP,AmEx expects government action on its credit card fees,"(Reuters) - American Express Co disclosed on Friday that it expects federal and state regulators to bring enforcement actions against the company over how it has charged late fees on certain card accounts. Regulators at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions have been reviewing the company’s practices under consumer protection laws and regulations, American Express said in its annual financial report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

72,AXP,"UPDATE 2-Discover Financial profit beats, foreign shores beckon","* Q1 EPS $1.18 vs est. 0.94 * Total loans up 9 percent to $56.3 bln * Says testing model to take brand to international markets By Jochelle Mendonca March 21 (Reuters) - Discover Financial Services’  quarterly profit handily beat Wall Street expectations for the eighth straight quarter, as more Americans used its credit cards, and the company said it is speeding up its expansion into international markets. While larger rival American Express has a strong credit card brand in international markets, Discover is just beginning to take its brand beyond U.S. shores. Earlier this month, the company said it signed an agreement with Diners Club Ecuador to issue Discover cards in that country. “We believe it will allow us to market test a model that could eventually become a framework for expanding Discover branded card issuance into additional countries with what to-date has been a purely domestic model,” Chief Executive David Nelms said on the post-earnings conference call. Like American Express, Discover lends directly to consumers and also competes with Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc  to process transactions for banks. In March, the company also signed a deal with National Payments Corporation of India which processes transactions in India. The moves make Discover less heavily dependent on the U.S. consumer to grow profits in the future. In the first quarter, Discover’s credit card loans grew $1.6 billion to $45.9 billion in the quarter and total loans, including private student loans, grew 9 percent to $56.3 billion. Transaction volume for the payment services segment grew 8 percent to $46.7 billion. Along with growing consumer loan balances and transaction volumes, Discover also saw bad debts fall in the first quarter — signalling better times for the U.S. consumer. The credit card lender and payment processing network set aside $152 million to cover future bad debt, down 64 percent from a year ago. Delinquency rates for loans over 30 days past due was 2.22 percent, down 137 basis points. But the company said it may have to increase its provision for loan losses later in 2012 as its loan balances increase.

73,AXP,"Security breach hits U.S. card processors, banks","(Reuters) - Four giant card-payment processors and large U.S. banks that issue debit and credit cards were hit by a data-security breach after third-party services provider Global Payments Inc discovered its systems were compromised by unauthorized access. It was not immediately clear how many cardholders became victims of the breach, which affected MasterCard Inc, Visa Inc, American Express Co and Discover Financial Services, as well as banks and other franchises that issue cards bearing their logos. U.S. law enforcement authorities including the Secret Service are investigating and MasterCard said it has hired an independent data-security organization to review the incident. The shares of Atlanta-based Global Payments, which acts as a credit-checking middleman between merchants and card processors, were halted on Friday afternoon after dropping more than 9 percent on the news. MasterCard shares fell 1.8 percent to close at $420.54, Visa shares dropped 0.8 percent to $118, American Express shares fell 0.1 percent to $57.86, while Discover rose 1.2 percent to $33.34. Analysts said any financial losses from the data breach would be shouldered by merchants, card issuers and Global Payments rather than Visa or Mastercard, which operate payment networks. Global Payments said it determined that an unauthorized entity had accessed its systems and possible customer card data in early March. Krebs on Security, a blog that first reported the incident on Friday, said accounts had been compromised for over a month, between January 21, 2012 and February 25, 2012. Global Payments is holding an investor conference call Monday morning to discuss the issue. This Global Payments breach is just the latest in a long string of incidents that have put the personal information of millions of credit and debit cardholders at risk. Individual banks and processors said they had not yet determined the full extent of the breach, but Krebs on Security described it as a “massive” breach that may affect more than 10 million cardholders. Some industry experts suggested the figure might be much less, perhaps on the order of tens of thousands. Bernstein Research analyst Rod Bourgeois noted that Global Payments is a relatively small player in the transactions services industry, servicing 800,000 merchants with a 3.5 percent market share. By contrast, the largest competitor, First Data, services millions of merchants, with 22.6 percent of the market. JPMorgan Chase & Co, as well as American Express and Discover, which issue their own cards, said they are monitoring customers’ accounts and would issue new cards to anyone whose information may have been compromised. Citigroup Inc said it has been notified by processors of the breach. Bank of America Corp declined to comment on the matter and Wells Fargo & Co said it was too early to comment on the impact. Banks and processors emphasized customers would not be held liable for any fraudulent charges that may occur. Mike Simonsen, the Chief Executive of real-estate research company Altos Research, said he may have been a victim. Simonsen said he was contacted by his bank, Bank of America Corp, last week about his Visa card. Although there were no unauthorized transactions, the representative told him a vendor or law enforcement agency had flagged his account as compromised and so he would receive a new one. “It was very unusual,” he said. Global Payments, which has about 3,700 employees, was spun off from information-services firm National Data Corp in 2001. For the fiscal year ended May 31, Global Payment reported revenue of $1.9 billion, an increase of 13 percent from the year-earlier period. According to a company presentation in January, the company was projected to report fiscal 2012 revenue in the range of $2.15 billion. The company is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter results on Wednesday and there had been the expectation Global Payments would report improving results. On Wednesday, Sterne Agee raised its price target for Global Payments to $65 a share from $58. Global Payments is one of dozens of companies that operate along the payment-processing chain, between the time a person swipes a card to pay and the time the payment is delivered. The account number, expiration date and possibly the cardholder’s name is sent from the point of payment to a processor, which then connects to Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover. Information is then sent to the card issuer — often a bank — which ultimately authorizes the transaction. The actual transfer of money occurs later. Processing companies, which perform millions of authorizations each day, are supposed to encrypt card information. But a breach could occur if someone gains access to the system and identifies a gap in the encryption. The information that was likely collected illegally from Global Payments is called Track 1 and Track 2 data. A person improperly using the information can transfer the account number and expiration date to a magnetic strip on a card and then try to use the card on a website. Thousands of U.S. banks that issue credit and debit cards receive daily alerts regarding breaches through a system referred to as CAMS, said Thomas McCrohan, an analyst with Janney Capital Markets. The illegal use of the data could be stymied if an online merchant asks for the three or four digits printed on a card known as the “CVV code.” “The systems can all be made tighter, but if they’re too tight no transactions would ever be approved,” said Edward Lawrence, a director at Auriemma Consulting Group, a payment systems consultant. “You still have to allow commerce to occur.” Rep. Mary Bono, a California Republican who chairs the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade, condemned the Global Payments breach and urged Congress to adopt stronger data-security legislation this year. “You shouldn’t have to cross your fingers and whisper a prayer when you type in a credit card number on your computer and hit ‘enter,’” she said in a statement. The Visa-Mastercard-Discover breach is the first major instance this year of consumer information put at risk by technological flaws or hacking, but there are plenty of examples of massive data breaches in recent years affecting banks, retailers, technology companies and payment processors. Last June, Citigroup said computer hackers breached the bank’s network and accessed data of about 200,000 cardholders in North America. Sony Corp also reported several recent attacks, including one last year in which hackers accessed the personal information on 77 million PlayStation Network accounts. Google Inc suffered a major attack on its Gmail accounts in 2011 that it said appeared to originate in China. Attacks against Gmail users involved direct attempts to compromise accounts by tricking users into revealing information - so-called “phishing” - or by gathering their passwords from other websites, rather than compromising Google systems, according to the company. Separately, TJX Companies Inc and Heartland Payment Systems Inc have had their systems compromised. On Friday, retailers were already beginning to look for fraudulent purchases from the compromised card accounts stemming from the Global Payments breach. They will bear the financial brunt of those crimes under rules worked out with the card associations and issuers, analysts said. “Our merchant community is sitting here girding itself and looking at their own fraud-prevention strategies and bracing for the influx of bad transactions,” said Tom Donlea, managing director for the Americas at the nonprofit Merchant Risk Council. “After Heartland and after the Sony breach, there was an increase in fraud activity.” (This version of the story corrects paragraph 29 to delete statement Google systems were compromised and adds that Gmail users were targets of a “phishing” scam) ",3302012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mastercard-breach/security-breach-hits-u-s-card-processors-banks-idUSBRE82T0VD20120330

Processor Global Payments Inc said on Friday it had found “unauthorized access” into its system early in March and notified law enforcement and financial institutions. Payment network operators MasterCard Inc, Visa Inc , American Express Co and Discover Financial Services confirmed they were affected, along with banks and other franchises that issue cards bearing their logos. A spokesman for the Secret Service said the agency is leading investigations into the case but declined to give any details. Though Global Payments is far from a household name, middlemen s uch as the company a re p rized targets f or hackers because of the vast amount of sensitive financial information they handle. The company’s stock fell more than 9 percent on the news before trading was halted. It said it would discuss the breach in a phone call for investors on Monday. It was not immediately clear how Global Payments was penetrated or how many accounts were exposed. Consumers who detect fraud usually can be reimbursed.

76,AXP,Higher consumer spending boosts AmEx profit,"(Reuters) - American Express Co (AXP.N) posted a strong first-quarter profit, as its customers spent more on their credit cards while redeeming fewer rewards, and the company said it will look to boost its digital offerings. As the U.S. economy begins to add jobs and gain strength, consumers have been spending more with their credit cards, the dollar volume of which grew 8.7 percent in March, according to KKR-owned payment processor First Data. Though American Express caters to the high-spending consumers who pay their bills on time, these sought-after customers also expect pricey rewards such as flight upgrades and free hotel rooms from the points they earn every time they swipe their cards, which sent its costs soaring last year. In the first quarter, costs for cardmember rewards fell 7 percent to $1.47 billion but the company’s customers spent more than they did last year. The company said the fall in reward costs was due to lower increases in the rate at which it expects members to redeem their points. While it expects the rate to rise in 2012, the increase will still be line with levels seen before 2011. On a post earnings conference call, Chief Financial Officer Dan Henry said the number of cards in circulation rose 7 percent to 98 million. American Express is also investing more money in building its e-commerce services. The company already has deals with social networking sites Facebook and Twitter and is expanding further online. It has been beefing up its digital commerce offering, Serve, which is an online payments platform. “Last year, we saw the digital growth at 22 percent of billings. I strongly suspect it’s in all likelihood growing at a faster rate than the average,” CFO Henry said on the call. The company appointed Neal Sample, the former chief technology officer of EBay’s (EBAY.O) commerce platform, to the Serve team earlier this month. “Digital at American Express is a buzz word. We think it’s important that we think about transforming the company,” Henry said. For the first quarter, net income was $1.26 billion, or $1.07 per share, compared with $1.18 billion, or 97 cents per share, last year. Total revenue, net of interest expense, was $7.61 billion, up 8 percent. Analysts expected the company to earn $1.00 per share on revenue of $7.57 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s lending business, which was one of the first to recover from a surge in losses on its credit cards during the financial crisis, has also seen fewer defaults. Among the large credit card companies, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), Discover Financial (DFS.N), Capital One (COF.N), Bank of America (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N), American Express had the lowest delinquency rate in March. But a larger lending portfolio led the company to set aside $412 million to cover future loan losses, more than four-times what it provisioned last year The credit card company said the comparison reflects the $725 million it released from its loan loss reserves last year. American Express, which lends directly to consumers but also competes with Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) to process credit card transactions, said global network and merchant services revenue grew 8 percent to $1.25 billion.

79,AXP,Can you have too many credit cards?,"(Reuters) - Vitaly Pecharsky, chief technology officer for the shopping site SlickDeals.net, is something of a credit card collector and has 40 active credit cards to show for his passion. “I have cards for every situation in life,” says Pecharsky, 32, who lives in Las Vegas, Nevada. His portfolio of cards - the oldest of which he’s had for 16 years - grows when there’s a credit card deal he just can’t refuse. Most recently, there was one that offered cash back on dining. He has others that give back cash for anything from gas to groceries. He estimates he gets $2,000-$3,000 a year in rewards and cash back. His strategy might be tempting at a time when card issuers are increasingly dangling reward offers. About three-quarters of all card offers in the first quarter of 2012 involved a reward program - up from 66 percent in the last quarter of 2011, according to the marketing intelligence firm Mintel Comperemedia. But, does a guy like Pecharsky - who is something of an outlier since the credit bureau Experian says consumers have an average of three cards and only 15 percent have more than seven - make credit experts cry? Not really. The key for evaluating Pecharsky’s 40 cards isn’t how many he has, but how much he spends in relation to how many cards he has (and that he has no negatives like missed payments). “You can’t have ‘too much credit,’ but you can utilize too much credit,” says Anthony Sprauve, a spokesman for FICO, the company that calculates the leading credit scores. “Credit utilization (amounts owed as a percentage of available credit) counts for 30 percent of a person’s credit score. The more of someone’s available credit they are using the bigger negative impact on their credit score.” If you have $100,000 in available credit and $10,000 charged on your cards, then you have a 10 percent utilization ratio. If you have $20,000 on them, the rate is 20 percent, and so on. For consumers with the best credit scores - at 760 or above - their average utilization rate is 7.0 percent, says John Ulzheimer, president of consumer education at SmartCredit.com, who previously worked for the credit scoring company FICO and credit bureau Equifax. You might assume that trimming off unused accounts (especially pruning multiple accounts from a big issuer like JPMorgan Chase & Co or Citigroup Inc.) would be like any other housekeeping measure - just ridding yourself of what you don’t need. But credit experts like Ulzheimer say that more is better, as long as you aren’t tempted to actually use all that borrowing power. It is the unused credit that is valuable, while overusing credit can have the opposite effect. The danger of overspending has long made it the conventional wisdom in the personal finance world to limit the number of cards you have. But David Bakke, 45, editor of the personal finance site MoneyCrashers.com, currently has eight active cards. “It surprises people that I have so many cards since there are many myths that say that simply applying or having multiple cards will hurt your credit score,” he says, but he adds, “That’s just not true.” Both Sprauve and Ulzheimer caution that if you want to embrace this philosophy of loading up on credit, going on an application binge isn’t going help. It takes time for your credit history to form. Also, applying for a series of cards one right after the other will push down your credit score, because credit applications have a negative impact. The next challenge you’ll face once you have a stack of new cards is how to keep them all active, using them at least once or twice a year. If you don’t, says Ulzheimer, “the issuer of the card actually loses money, and eventually they’re going to close your account.” Some cardholders arrange to have different bills automatically charged to their different cards every month, just to make sure their cards get some use, but that can involve a lot of bill-paying organizing, too. Fail to pay every credit card bill on time and you can end up with penalty fees and interest high enough to negate the value of those card rewards. Thanks to the 2009 federal Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure (CARD) Act, consumers no longer face inactivity fees or charges to reopen a closed card. But if you want a closed account back, you’ll have to apply for it anew - meaning a negative to your credit score because another credit report will be run. When it comes to applying for a larger loan, like a mortgage, the number of credit cards you have won’t hurt you a bit, says David Boone, first vice president and head of mortgage origination for The Provident Bank in Jersey City, New Jersey. A bigger problem is applicants who don’t have at least three “trade lines” - credit cards or auto loans - to establish a strong enough history, he says. Someone with a lot of lines and lot of available credit who has kept usage low and maintained a solid history of payment is a good candidate for a mortgage. “We do scratch our heads sometimes,” Boone says. “Why does that guy have five Visa cards from Chase?” (The author is a Reuters contributor.)

80,AXP,TEXT-S&P; says American Express rtgs unaffected by Q1 results,"April 19 - Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services said today that its ratings on American Express Co. (Amex; BBB+/Stable/A-2) are not immediately affected by the company’s good first-quarter results, which were consistent with our expectations, given the current operating conditions. 	 	 Amex generated $2.2 billion in pretax preprovision earnings in the first 	 quarter, which was relatively flat compared with the previous quarter but up 	 19.5% year over year. Revenues increased 8% year over year, reflecting a 9% 	 growth in discount revenues and a 6% increase in net interest income. 	 Operating expenses rose 13%, compared with first-quarter 2011; but on an 	 adjusted basis (excluding the impact of the Visa/Master card settlement) 	 expenses increased only 5%.	 	 The billed business increased 12% year over year, reflecting an increase in 	 credit card usage, as well as an increase in the number of credit cards issued 	 and outstanding. If the U.S. economy continues to improve at a slow pace, we 	 believe the billed business will benefit and continue to grow. However, 	 macroeconomic challenges could change our expectation.	 	 The loan-loss and fraud provision totaled $412 million in the first quarter, 	 marginally up from $409 million in the previous quarter but considerably 	 higher than the $97 million in first-quarter 2011. The year-over-year increase 	 was mainly due to the larger reserve release in first-quarter 2011, compared 	 with first-quarter 2012. 	 	 Asset quality in the charge card and lending businesses remained stable, with 	 net charge-offs remaining relatively flat while delinquencies improved 	 slightly. The managed lending net write-off rate dropped to 2.3%—its lowest 	 level in more than a decade. However, the U.S. card services charge card 	 segment’s net write-off rate increased to 2.3%, compared with 1.9% in the 	 previous quarter, as the company grew this business. We don’t expect the 	 write-off rate to increase materially from this level. 	 	 Capital levels strengthened further in the quarter, and the Tier 1 common 	 ratio rose 110 basis points to a solid 13.4%. We believe the capital levels 	 could remain relatively flat for the remainder of 2012, but they may trend 	 lower as Amex returns capital to shareholders and pursues acquisition 	 opportunities. The Federal Reserve had no objections to Amex’s capital plan. 	 As a result, the company increased dividends to $0.20 from $0.18, and it is 	 moving ahead with its plans to repurchase up to $4 billion in shares in 2012 	 and up to an additional $1 billion in first-quarter 2013. Liquidity was 	 seasonally high in the first quarter, but, as the year progresses, we expect 	 excess cash and securities to decline closer to the level of the firm’s 	 short-term maturities.	 	 Amex has reported good growth in revenues and earnings, good capital 	 accumulation, and better credit performance during the past few quarters. 	 However, as the credit cycle normalizes and the company’s focus turns more to 	 growth and returning capital to shareholders, we expect the rate of 	 improvement to slow. Our ratings and outlook incorporate these expectations.",4192012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA538120120419

83,AXP,Zynga launches prepaid debit card with American Express,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Zynga Inc., the social games publisher, has reached a partnership agreement with American Express to issue a prepaid debit card that could be used to redeem virtual credits, the two companies said. The partnership will help increase use of American Express’ digital payments platform Serve as the credit card issuer competes with online gateway Paypal, a unit of eBay Inc, which is pushing to process transactions by mobile phones. Zynga, whose shares have fallen as user numbers for its most popular games decline, aims to boost the profile of its partnership programs with major companies and also to retain users, who will be rewarded with in-game credits for swiping the American Express card. “This is the first rewards program for a pre-paid card, and Zynga and American Express have the opportunity to bring value to Zynga players, while connecting and expanding American Express’ customer base,” Jeff Karp, Zynga’s chief marketing and revenue officer, told Reuters. The two companies declined to disclose financial details of the partnership. Beginning this week, cardholders who make purchases exceeding $25 will collect “Farm Cash,” the currency used to purchase virtual goods within Zynga’s FarmVille game. Zynga said it will roll out similar rewards for its CastleVille and CityVille in the coming months. “This enables us for the first time, in a fully integrated fashion, to link everyday spend that you would do online or offline to in-game virtual currency rewards and special offers,” said Daniel Schulman, group president of enterprise growth at American Express. In the future, Schulman said, the program will be expanded so Zynga players can receive real-life discounts for in-game activity. Zynga shares have shed almost half its value since April 1 amid investor doubts over whether the company can sustain its revenue growth.

89,AXP,AmEx revenue misses as spending growth moderates,"(Reuters) - Credit card company American Express Co’s (AXP.N) second-quarter revenue marginally missed Wall Street estimates as cardmember spending growth moderated amid low consumer confidence. U.S. retail sales fell in June for the third straight month, the longest run of consecutive drops since 2008, and consumer sentiment is now at its lowest level in seven months as Americans take a dim view of their finances and job prospects. “Overall cardmember spending rose 7 percent, or 9 percent adjusted for foreign currency translations. That’s slower than the increases we’ve seen in the recent quarters,” Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Chenault said in a statement. Cardmember spending at the company, which focuses on the affluent customer, grew in the double-digit range for the last nine quarters. American Express said spending growth rates slowed across all business lines and all segments. The company’s card data is widely held as an indicator of the spending sentiment of the more affluent consumer, signaling that the weak recovery is taking its toll across all economic segments. American Express, which lends directly to consumers and also competes with Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) to process credit card transactions, said it does not believe it will be affected by merchant cases related to interchange or “swipe” fees it charges. Visa and MasterCard — which together control more than 60 percent of the payment processing market — and the banks that issue their credit cards agreed to a $7.25 billion antitrust settlement on Friday, but some merchant cases are still being litigated. “American Express does not have market power. We continue to believe that there’s no merit to the separate merchant cases that we are involved in, and we believe that we have strong legal defenses,” a company executive said on a conference call. The anti-trust settlement will also allow stores to start charging customers extra for using certain credit cards in an effort to steer them toward cheaper forms of payment. American Express said 50 percent of its U.S. billings come from states that currently prohibit surcharging, and it will continue to require parity treatment from merchants. In the second-quarter, the company earned $1.34 billion, or $1.15 per share, compared with $1.33 billion, or $1.10 per share, a year earlier. The number of outstanding shares fell 4 percent from a year earlier. Total revenue, net of interest expense, was $7.96 billion, up 5 percent. Analysts on an average had expected the company to earn $1.09 per share, on revenue of $8.06 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. American Express has the lowest delinquency rate among the large credit card issuers, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), Discover Financial (DFS.N), Capital One (COF.N), Bank of America (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N). Shares of the company, which have risen 11 percent in the last year, were down 1 percent in trading after the bell. They closed at $58.29 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

94,AXP,AmEx to refund $85 million to credit card customers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American Express will refund $85 million to customers to resolve charges that three subsidiaries broke consumer protection laws across the credit card business, U.S. regulators said on Monday. Subsidiaries misrepresented the perks consumers would receive if they enrolled in a credit card program, charged certain consumers higher late fees than were legally permissible, misled consumers about debt collection and committed other violations, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said. In addition to the refund to about 250,000 customers, American Express will pay civil penalties totaling $27.5 million to the CFPB, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. “Several American Express companies violated consumer protection laws and those laws were violated at all stages of the game - from the moment a consumer shopped for a card to the moment the consumer got a phone call about long overdue debt,” CFPB Director Richard Cordray said. The consumer bureau was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law and charged with overseeing credit cards, mortgage loans and other consumer financial products. Since opening in July 2011, the agency has gone after credit card companies for violating consumer laws. Discover Bank, part of Discover Financial Services, agreed to pay $214 million to resolve charges of deceptive marketing. Capital One Financial Corp was fined $210 million in July on similar charges. The latest probe identified marketing violations and other problems that occurred from 2003 to the spring of 2012 at American Express Centurion Bank, American Express Bank and American Express Travel Related Services Company. Those companies are responsible for notifying consumers. “From the moment we learned of the wrongdoing at American Express, we have been troubled by the range of problems that our examination process uncovered,” said Kent Markus, assistant director of enforcement at the CFPB. “The legal violations we discovered span the lifecycle of a consumer’s experience with American Express cards.” American Express is conducting an internal probe of the violations and has already counted a “substantial portion” of expenses related to the charges against its earnings, spokeswoman Marina Norville said.

101,AXP,"Wal-Mart, Amex take on banks with low-priced debit card","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc and American Express Co are teaming up to offer a prepaid debit card called Bluebird to target lower-income shoppers who may not have bank accounts. The move will give American Express, best known for its affluent cardholders, a 4,000-store gateway to tens of millions of so-called “underbanked” households and the fees they will generate as technology moves more of their transactions from cash to digital payments. At the same time, Walmart will get to extend its mantra of “every day low prices” to yet another sphere and come closer to achieving its years-long goal of offering banking services. It also recently announced a deal with Metlife Inc to offer life insurance in a pilot program in South Carolina and Georgia. “Walmart is doing everything it can to be a financial services provider to the largest number of Americans possible,” said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, which tracks the payments industry. The Bluebird, which will be available next week, offers something similar to a checking account, but without minimum balance requirements or monthly or annual fees. Adding money is free, unlike other cards, known as prepaid debit or reloadable cards. Bluebird cards will be accepted anywhere that accepts American Express cards, not just at Walmart. “This is incredibly cheap. This is one of the best, if not the best, options for prepaid cards,” said Anisha Sekar, vice president for credit and debit products at NerdWallet.com, which compares prices for financial products. The average American pays about $200 a year in ATM fees, overdraft fees and other bank fees, said Daniel Eckert, Walmart’s vice president of financial services. Monday’s announcement sent shockwaves through parts of the rapidly changing payments industry. Shares of Green Dot Corp, which sells more expensive prepaid cards through Walmart, plunged 20 percent. NetSpend Holdings, another provider of prepaid debit cards, fell 7 percent. Bluebird also brings a new threat to the relationships banks have with their customers. If the deal with Walmart works for American Express, the financial services company could take market share from other banks. “This is one salvo,” said Toos Daruvala, a consultant in McKinsey & Co.’s North America banking and securities practice. “All banks need to try to figure out who is friend, who is foe, who they are going to partner with and who they are going to compete against in the world of retailers, telecoms and technology players.” Bluebird accounts will accept payroll direct deposits and smartphone deposits of photographed checks. They will also allow holders to make mobile payments and person-to-person transfers. “We reimagined how banking might be done in the 21st century,” said Dan Schulman, American Express’s group president of Enterprise Growth. “Every Walmart cash register is the equivalent of a (bank) teller.” Prepaid cards had been the subject of near-universal scorn by consumer advocates for their often high and complicated fees. But in the past year large banks, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of American Corp, Wells Fargo & Co and U.S. Bancorp, began marketing simpler and low-cost versions of the cards. The Bluebird accounts, like most prepaid accounts, do not allow for paper check-writing and do not charge overdraft fees. Amex wants to add check-writing next year. Schulman declined to say how that would work without overdraft penalties. While American Express may be risking its upscale image by partnering with Walmart, having more cards in use may cause more merchants to accept all Amex cards. Amex is third to Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc in the size of its merchant network. Walmart’s efforts to get into the banking business have spanned more than a decade. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has applied for bank charters several times, but has failed amid opposition from banks, unions and others. Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, has long tried to serve its lower-income shoppers who have little or no access to credit. It has offered various financial services to shoppers for more than a decade, including check-cashing, domestic and international money transmission, walk-in bill payment and gift cards. SW Retail Advisors founder Stacey Widlitz noted that dollar stores - which include Family Dollar and Dollar Tree - have been trying to wrestle market share from Walmart by adding more groceries and payment types. “But Walmart isn’t lying down and taking it quietly,” Widlitz said. “The Amex card is another way to appeal to the low-income consumer.” There is more potential as well for the debit card. Those higher up the income ladder, who have checking accounts with banks, use them for budgeting and cybersecurity. Bluebird will be available next week online and in more than 4,000 Walmart stores in the United States. Cash withdrawals from the 22,000 ATMs in the MoneyPass network carry no fees or surcharges for customers enrolled in direct deposit. For those without direct deposit, withdrawals are $2. For out-of-network ATMs, each withdrawal is $2 and additional operator fees may apply. Walmart and American Express declined to reveal the terms of the deal or detail exactly how they will make money from the partnership, which could become more important as the proliferation of smartphones encourages digital transactions. “A surprising number of underbanked consumers have a smartphone” they can use with a prepaid account to make purchases, Robertson said.

103,AXP,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 5-Wal-Mart, Amex take on banks with low-priced debit card","(Corrects spelling of Daruvala, paragraph 11) * Bluebird card available next week at Walmart stores, online * Amex gets access to 4,000 stores, spending by under-banked * Wal-Mart brings low-pricing to card accounts * Average American pays $200 annually in fees * Shares of rival card companies NetSpend, Green Dot tank By Martinne Geller and David Henry NEW YORK, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc and American Express Co are teaming up to offer a prepaid debit card called Bluebird to target lower-income shoppers who may not have bank accounts. The move will give American Express, best known for its more affluent cardholders, a 4,000-store gateway to tens of millions of so-called “underbanked” households and the fees they will generate as technology moves more of their transactions from cash to digital payments. At the same time, Walmart will get to extend its mantra of “every day low prices” to yet another sphere and come closer to achieving its years-long goal of offering banking services. “Walmart is doing everything it can to be a financial services provider to the largest number of Americans possible,” said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, which tracks the payments industry. The Bluebird, which will be available next week, offers  something similar to a checking account, but without minimum balance requirements or monthly or annual fees. Adding money is free, unlike other cards, known as prepaid debit cards or reloadable cards. Bluebird cards will be accepted anywhere that accepts American Express cards, not just at Walmart. “This is incredibly cheap. This is one of the best, if not the best, options for prepaid cards, said Anisha Sekar, vice president for credit and debit products at NerdWallet.com, which compares prices for financial products. The average American pays about $200 a year in ATM fees, overdraft fees and other bank fees, said Daniel Eckert, Walmart’s vice president of financial services. The elimination of those fees should free up more money to spend elsewhere. The announcement sent shockwaves through parts of the rapidly changing payments industry. Shares of Green Dot Corp,  which currently sells more expensive prepaid cards through Walmart, dropped 20 percent, and NetSpend Holdings,  another provider of prepaid debit cards fell 3 percent, as bigger, more powerful companies move in on their business. Bluebird also brings a new threat to the relationships banks have with their customers. If the deal with Walmart works for American Express, the financial services company could take market share from other banks. “This is one salvo,” said Toos Daruvala, a consultant in McKinsey & Co.’s North America banking and securities practice. “All banks need to try to figure out who is friend, who is foe, who they are going to partner with and who they are going to compete against in the world of retailers, telecoms and technology players.” Bluebird accounts will accept payroll direct deposits and smartphone deposits of photographed checks. They will also allow holders to make mobile payments and person-to-person transfers. “We reimagined how banking might be done in the 21st century,” said Dan Schulman, American Express’s group president of Enterprise Growth. “Where every Walmart cash register is the equivalent of a (bank) teller.” Prepaid cards have been the subject of near-universal scorn by consumer advocates for their often high and complicated fees until the past year when large banks, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co began marketing simple and low-cost versions, partly to cut their own costs of dealing with people with less money. Walmart’s efforts to get into the banking business have spanned more than a decade. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has applied for bank charters several times, but has failed amid opposition from banks, unions and others. Prepaid card accounts are not subject to as many government regulations as traditional bank checking accounts, researchers at the Pew Charitable Trusts said last month. [ID:nL2E8K56AJ} The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is looking to impose restrictions. Of particular concern is fees for overdrawing accounts. The Bluebird accounts do not currently run that risk because they do not allow holders to spend more money than they have on the cards. Schulman declined to say how the company will handle the issue once it allows customers to write checks on the account, expected next year. Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, has long tried to serve its lower-income shoppers who have little or no access to credit. It has offered various financial services to shoppers for more than a decade, including check-cashing, domestic and international money transmission, walk-in bill payment, gift cards, and general prepaid card services. SW Retail Advisors founder Stacey Widlitz noted that dollar stores - which include Family Dollar and Dollar Tree  - have been trying to wrestle market share from Walmart by adding more groceries and payment types. “But Walmart isn’t lying down and taking it quietly,” Widlitz said. “The Amex card is another way to appeal to the low-income consumer.” Bluebird will be available next week online and in more than 4,000 Walmart stores in the United States.

104,AXP,UPDATE 3-Corporate cutbacks hold back Amex profit,"* Q3 EPS $1.09 vs $1.03 a year earlier * Q3 revenue up 4 pct * Corporate belt-tightening holds back growth By Jochelle Mendonca Oct 17 (Reuters) - American Express Co’s  third-quarter profit rose only marginally and spending growth remained muted for the second quarter in a row as corporate executives cut spending on travel and entertainment. Expense accounts have come under greater scrutiny as companies look to cut costs to protect profit margins, hurting the credit card lender, which gets more than a quarter of its U.S. billed business from corporate customers. Amex shares dipped 1 percent in after-hours trading after it reported a modest 1 percent rise in quarterly profit. Travel and entertainment volumes grew 4 percent, the slowest rise this year and far below the 12 percent growth seen a year earlier. Total card member spending in the United States rose 8 percent from a year earlier, the second quarter in a row that growth has been in single digits, after nine quarters of double-digit growth. The slowing growth echoes that of other large credit card issuers. U.S. credit card volume growth decelerated at both Bank of America and U.S. Bancorp, which reported results earlier on Wednesday. American Express, which has a market value of more than $66 billion, is looking to expand its market beyond the affluent, for whom there is stiff competition in the card market. The company has teamed up with Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world’s largest retailer, to offer a prepaid debit card to target lower-income shoppers who may not have bank accounts. “It does push more volume onto our network..it’s a growing market,” Chief Financial Officer Dan Henry said on a post-earnings conference call. It is also a more cheery sector. U.S. consumer confidence hit a five-year high last month but chief executives has sunk to their grimmest outlook for the economy in three years. The move gives Amex access to tens of million of new consumers at a time when regulators are clamping down on credit insurance and other add-on credit card products. Amex agreed this month to refund $85 million to customers to resolve charges that three subsidiaries broke consumer protection laws in the way it marketed credit card add-ons. Henry said the company would stop selling account and ID protection products at the end of this year, given the regulatory concerns. He added the products were not a significant source of revenue for the company. The slowing card spending growth saw Amex’s profit rise just 1 percent to $1.25 billion, or $1.09 per share. Revenue grew at the slowest rate in 11 quarters. Total revenue, net of interest expense, was $7.86 billion, up 4 percent. Analysts on average had expected the company to earn $1.09 per share, on revenue of $7.90 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company has the lowest delinquency rate among the large credit card companies, including JPMorgan Chase, Discover Financial, Capital One, Bank of America and Citigroup. But it set aside $479 million to cover future bad loans, reflecting its larger lending portfolio, 92 percent more than it had provisioned last year. The large increase also reflects a $421 million reserve release in the year-ago quarter. “We didn’t have the same benefit from substantial reserve releases as last year when write-offs and delinquencies were declining at a faster rate,” Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault said in a statement. American Express, which lends directly to consumers and also competes with Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc to process credit card transactions, said global network and merchant services revenue grew 5 percent to $1.3 billion. Shares of the company, which have risen more than 24 percent so far this year, were down about 1 percent at $58.80 after the bell.

That figure, though up from the second quarter, is still below the double-digit growth the company had posted for the nine preceding quarters. “It represents slower growth than we were generating earlier in the year, a trend that we are seeing among major card issuers,” Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault said in a statement.",10172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/amex-results/american-express-3rd-qtr-profit-rises-marginally-idUSL3E8LG5TE20121017

107,AXP,"As others skimp, rich splurge on holiday gifts: study","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Scrooge-like spending patterns for the holidays appear to be a thing of the past for wealthy Americans, who are preparing to open their wallets this year after sitting on piles of cash. The richest Americans, those in the top 10 percent, or with more than $100,000 in discretionary income, are predicted to spend more this holiday season than the remaining 90 percent of the country’s population, according to a quarterly survey by American Express released on Thursday. While most Americans will spend less on gifts this year, the top 10 percent raise their gift spending by 21.9 percent, to $19.2 billion, up from $15.7 billion in 2011. That compares with a projected drop in overall gift spending of 3.4 percent, to $66.3 billion, from $66.6 billion last year, according to the American Express 2012 Survey of Affluence and Wealth in America. The spending by the wealthiest 10 percent will account for 29 percent of total spending on gifts. The rise is explained by the fact that wealthy Americans are sitting on huge piles of savings, said Jim Taylor, vice chairman of the Harrison Group, which conducted the study. Top earners are saving at a high rate - 61 percent of those in the top 1 percent are saving at least 25 percent of their income yearly. But for Americans outside the top 10 percent, only 14 percent are able to save at such an aggressive rate. “If the floodgates open, it will lead to a capital boom,” Taylor said. The moneyed will also spend differently - shelling out for high-end luxury items, shunning gift cards and spending quite a bit on themselves, American Express said. The study, conducted in September, surveyed 832 people with household incomes of more than $138,000 and discretionary income over $100,000. There are other signs, however, that Americans overall are starting to spend more. While the American Express study only surveyed gift spending, an annual forecast by the National Retail Federation’s forecast that looked more broadly at holiday spending - including decorations, greeting cards, holiday foods, flowers and other items, as well as gifts - saw a rise of 1.2 percent, to $749.51 per consumer, up from $740.57 last year. The richest 10 percent may have more money, but in at least one way they are just like other Americans: they want gift cards. Some 60 percent of Americans desire gift cards, according to the NRF. However, the spouses or partners of the wealthy are not planning on getting them what they want, according to American Express. Of the 34 percent of women who want a gift card to a specific retailer, only 11 percent of their spouses or partners plan on giving that as a gift. For the 18 percent of men who want a gift certificate to a restaurant, only 5 percent of their partners are likely to be wrapping that up. “Nobody is going to give somebody a gift card for $5,000 rather than getting them that new bracelet. It’s not quite the same emotional impact,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a New Canaan, Connecticut-based company that analyzes retail trends. Because of the disparity between what respondents want and what they’re likely to get, the richest Americans plan to do a lot of shopping for themselves for the holidays - 46 percent of women in the wealthiest 10 percent say they will buy for themselves, and 27 percent of men, said the Harrison Group’s Taylor. Clothing, accessories and jewelry are among the top items women will be buying for themselves. Men will snap up clothing, fine liquor and gourmet foods.

111,AXP,UPDATE 1-U.S. Supreme Court to review Amex arbitration case,"* Court to review mandatory arbitration clause * Merchants say should be able to sue as a class By Terry Baynes and Jonathan Stempel Nov 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to consider whether American Express Co may invoke an arbitration clause to prevent merchant customers from banding together in an antitrust lawsuit against the company. The court accepted the credit card and travel services company’s appeal from a February ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York th at vo ided the clause, and allowed merchants including the Italian Colors Restaurant in Oakland, California to pursue a class-action lawsuit. A decision could determine the extent to which companies might rely on arbitration clauses to fend off class-action lawsuits, which can allow litigants to obtain larger recoveries at lower cost. Since 1999, American Express has required merchant customers to w aive thei r right to sue the company in a class action. But a group of restaurants, retailers and other customers sued in 2003, saying the New York-based company violated antitrust law in its effort to force them to pay in flated fees on ch arge card transactions. A two-judge panel of the 2nd Circuit said the company’s mandatory arbitration clause violated antitrust law, because many merchants would find it economically unfeasible to pu rsue their claims individually. American Express said that ruling created a “sweeping, unwritten loophole” in federal arbitration law that should be overturned. The Supreme Court has in recent years shown deference to arbitration clauses, while narrowing the ability of various plaintiffs to bring class-action lawsuits. In a 2011 case involving AT&T; Inc, the court gave businesses a big victory by upholding contracts that required customers to submit to individual arbitrations to resolve disputes, and waive their right to pursue class-action litigation. A California law had prohibited such waivers. The same year, the court decertified a class of as many as 1.5 million female workers at Wal-Mart Stores Inc who alleged gender bias in pay and promotions. The Supreme Court will likely hear oral arguments in the American Express case early next year, with a decision to follow by the end of June. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was involved with the case when she was a federal appeals court judge, did not take part in the decision to accept American Express’ appeal.

114,AXP,"European companies maintain budgets, will travel","(Reuters.com) - The majority of European companies said they maintained their business travel budgets in 2012 according to an industry survey released on Wednesday, with travel spend to be protected from cuts next year. American Express Global Business Travel takes a Barometer of the business travel landscape on an annual basis to analyse corporate travel spend and firms’ adherence to travel policies. In its 2012 survey of over 500 European companies the travel management firm found that 63 percent of them maintained their business travel budgets in the last year, with 23 percent increasing travel spending. Just 14 percent of companies cut business travel budgets. This compares to a telling decrease of 21 percent in 2011, 40 percent in 2010 and 66 percent in 2009. Most of the surveyed firms (73 percent) are not planning to tinker with budgets next year, while only 16 percent intend to increase spending. Another prominent player in the travel management space, Carlson Wagonlit Travel CWT.L has similar predictions for 2013. Andrew Waller, CWT’s president EMEA, wrote in a recent forecast report that, “All indications we have are that business travel will remain flat in Europe throughout 2013... Growth is unlikely until there is more clarity around solving the euro crisis and confidence returns.” “We see this process stretching well into 2014.” The AMEX barometer also found that the implementation of a strict corporate travel policy is now widespread, with more than 90 percent of large companies confirming that they have one. However, AMEX found that only 30 percent of companies measure the return on investment of travel spending, saying that this makes “it hard to analyse the bottom line benefits that travel expenditure can offer.” “Companies across Europe recognise that business travel is an important investment that adds value and drives business growth,” said Anthony Drury, vice president and GM, American Express Global Business Travel, UK and Nordics. “Our Barometer helps companies understand how to maximise their business travel spend by providing an overview of trends and best practices in Europe.” Some of these trends include booking tickets in advance; booking best available fares; using preferred suppliers; favouring rail over air travel; using low-cost travel options; and developing virtual meetings. Despite the economic uncertainty in Europe, the cost of travel looks set to rise, though only slightly. According to the 2013 CWT Price Forecast, EMEA air fares are expected to go up by 2.5 percent thanks to airlines’ tight capacity controls. AMEX Global Business Travel expects conservative increases in corporate hotel rates, despite relatively constant hotel room capacity, and flat car rental prices. “The European hotel market in particular has seen little expansion as the recent economic crisis has constrained investment,” it says. High speed rail fares are also set to rise by 9 percent in premium cabins, with a forecast 4.3 percent overall for the region.

117,AXP,New York antitrust trial begins over credit card arbitrations,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three of the largest U.S. credit card issuers headed to trial on Monday to defend accusations that they colluded to force customers to agree to settle disputes through arbitration rather than in class action lawsuits. American Express Co (AXP.N), Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) face the allegations in two antitrust lawsuits filed by customers who had to sign arbitration agreements in order to get credit cards. U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan is hearing the cases without a jury. The trial follows a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2011. That case involved an AT&T; Inc (T.N) unit, and bolstered corporations’ ability to require customers to arbitrate disputes over fees or other issues. Arbitration puts more costs and burdens on individuals than if they collectively pursued claims in class actions, consumer advocates say. No damages are being sought in the antitrust lawsuits, which were filed in 2004 and 2005, and consolidated for trial before Pauley in March. Instead, the plaintiffs are asking the judge to order American Express, Discover and Citigroup to remove arbitration clauses from their cardholder agreements. The plaintiffs also want an eight-year ban on arbitration clauses by the trio, which had 31.4 percent of outstanding credit card balances in 2011, according to The Nilson Report, a payment card industry newsletter. In the first day of testimony on Monday, lead plaintiff Robert Ross from Pennsylvania said he did not view arbitration as a “fair venue” for consumers. “If the average consumer was aware of the costs they’d have to bear in arbitration, they wouldn’t do it,” Ross said in response to questioning by a lawyer for American Express, Rowan Wilson of Cravath, Swaine & Moore. Lawyers for the plaintiffs will present evidence that big banks in 28 meetings from 1999 to 2003 discussed how to institute mandatory arbitration clauses, court documents show. Within three years, all the banks imposed almost identical arbitration clauses that prevented cardholders from pursuing class actions, the plaintiffs claim. Citigroup, Discover and American Express assert that they adopted the arbitration agreements independently. They also contend that the plaintiffs have failed to show that arbitration clauses curb competition or cause injury under federal antitrust law. “We include arbitration in our cardmember agreements because we think that it is an important part of American Express’s overall approach to resolving any disputes with its cardmembers quickly and efficiently,” American Express representative Marina Hoffmann Norville told Reuters. Representatives for Discover and Citigroup declined to comment. Four other banks — JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), HSBC Holdings PLC (HSBA.L) and Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) — settled claims in one of the lawsuits against them in 2010 by removing the arbitration clauses from their cardholder agreements for 3-1/2 years. Those banks also agreed to pay the plaintiffs’ lawyers $2.35 million in fees and expenses. Following those settlements, credit card loans outstanding subject to arbitration clauses plunged from 95.1 percent at the end of 2009 to 48 percent a year later, according to a paper released in November by Peter Rutledge of University of Georgia School of Law and Christopher Drahozal at University of Kansas School of Law. The settlements with the four banks are set to expire later this year, allowing them to again mandate arbitration. The cases in the U.S. District for the Southern District of New York are Ross v. Bank of America, N.A., et al., 05-07116, and Ross v. American Express Company, 04-5723.

The company said some of the cuts would be offset by new hiring but expects to reduce its workforce 4 to 6 percent by the end of 2013. It currently employs 63,500 people. New York-based AmEx said the reductions would be spread proportionately between the U.S. and international markets. “For the next two years, our aim is to hold annual operating expense increases to less than 3 percent,” Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault said in a statement.

It also booked a $212 million charge to account for a larger number of customers redeeming the rewards they earn while using its cards. AmEx also took a $95 million charge for cardmember reimbursements for transactions going back several years. The company said cardmember spending grew 8 percent in the fourth quarter, the third straight quarter of single-digit growth after nine quarters of double-digit growth.

123,AXP,"American Express to cut 5,400 jobs, take charges in fourth quarter","(Reuters) - Credit card company American Express Co said it would cut about 5,400 jobs, or 8.5 percent of its workforce, as it restructures its business and pay legal bills. The steps will cost the company about $600 million in charges in the fourth quarter after taxes, which will halve its net income. Nearly $300 million of the charges are to cover restructuring, primarily in its travel division, to save money and adapt to the fact that customers increasingly book travel online and on their mobile phones instead of with travel agents. The other half of the charges are for higher costs from customers redeeming more rewards for spending with cards, as well as $153 million of payments to reimburse customers that were overcharged or short-changed benefits. American Express tends to cut staff at the beginning of recessions. But CEO Kenneth Chenault, speaking to stock analysts after the announcement Thursday, said spending with its cards continues to grow. “This is not driven by our view of the macro environment,” he said. The company said the job cuts will happen over the year and come even as it hires some new employees and invests in more online customer service. The current workforce of 63,500 people will be about 4 to 6 percent smaller by the end of 2013. The job reductions would be spread proportionately between the U.S. and international markets, New York-based AmEx said. Even with the restructuring, Chenault said operating costs could increase by as much as 3 percent annually as the company spends more money for cardholder services, international expansion, and new products, such as prepaid debit cards. At the same time, the company said that it is going to pay out $153 million to customers because of errors it made in charging fees and crediting people with rewards for spending with their cards. Many of the reimbursements stem from previously-disclosed consent orders that the company reached with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in October. Others are for problems the company found as its went back into its records as far as seven years, Chief Financial Officer Dan Henry told analysts. Some of the errors happened as the company got caught up in applying complex award formulas. For example, a cardmember who bought vegetables in a market that the company had not classified as a supermarket wrongly received half the reward points due, Henry said. Cardholders due money will be notified directly in coming months, the company said. “We are going to continue to work closely with regulators and strengthen our controls,” Chenault said in a statement from the company. The company also said that a previously-announced review of its model for forecasting how many of its member rewards will be redeemed showed that it was underestimating redemptions. The company now expects customers to redeem 94 percent of their rewards, instead of 93 percent, a difference that forced it to set aside an extra $342 million to cover the expense. The change means the company will show about $40 million each year of additional expense, Henry said. The cost is worthwhile, Chenault said, because customers who use the rewards programs more tend to use their cards for more of their spending and are less likely to switch to a different credit or charge card. Higher spending translates to higher revenue for the company from merchants who take the cards for payment. Without the charges, the company said it would have reported fourth-quarter adjusted net income at $1.2 billion, or $1.09 per share. Instead, it said made $637 million, or 56 cents per share.

129,AXP,Retail trade group to opt out of $7.2 billion credit card-fee pact,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A major retail trade association said Wednesday it will reject a proposed $7.2 billion settlement with credit-card giants Visa Inc (V.N) and Mastercard Inc (MA.N) over card fees, calling it a “bad deal” for nearly 8 million U.S. merchants. The Retail Industry Leaders Association, or RILA, said it intends to “make a statement” by opting out of the potentially historic settlement just as lead lawyers for the plaintiffs and credit-card companies are preparing to file papers seeking final approval from a federal judge in Brooklyn, N.Y. RILA represents some of the largest U.S. retailers, including Walmart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Target Corp (TGT.N) and Home Depot Inc, all of which have previously expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed settlement. The move could prompt a new round of criticism of the deal from large U.S. retailers and possibly more opt-outs. The credit card companies believe they have a judge’s backing in the settlement, but a high number of opt-outs could imperil the hard-fought pact. The proposed settlement, announced last year, would resolve an eight-year old lawsuit on behalf of U.S. merchants accusing Visa and Mastercard of artificially raising interchange, or swipe, fees, which are paid to process credit-card transactions. The settlement includes a $6.05 billion payment and $1.2 billion in temporary swipe-fee reductions, as well as changes to Visa and Mastercard rules to allow merchants to charge customers extra for using certain cards. U.S. District Judge John Gleeson has already given preliminary approval to the proposal, potentially the largest private antitrust settlement in U.S. history. Nearly 8 million stores, restaurants and other merchants that accept credit cards have been given until May 28 to opt out or object to the deal. If merchants opt out, they will not be eligible to receive a portion of the monetary damages. But they note that they will be bound by parts of the settlement that would prohibit them from suing Visa and Mastercard over similar interchange issues in the future, if the settlement is approved. RILA general counsel Deborah White said that the group is opting out of the settlement on its own behalf, and that each of its members will have to decide individually whether to object, opt out, or stay in the litigation. “We do have the support from a large majority of our membership for opting out and objecting, and we want to make sure we’re shedding light on what the true ramifications are for the proposed settlement,” White said in an interview. The group believes that the litigation releases in the settlement will force merchants to forego future legal claims against Visa and Mastercard in exchange for “paltry” monetary relief over years of harm from swipe fees, which have cost merchants billions of dollars, White said. RILA is among the first major trade groups to come out swinging against the deal, which drew a flurry of opposition at the preliminary approval stage last year. The National Grocers Association said in February that it would opt out, and urged its members to do the same. Visa, Mastercard and a lawyer for lead plaintiffs supporting the settlement did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday evening. Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman for the Electronic Payments Coalition, which represents the payment card industry, said she remained “highly confident that this (settlement) will be approved, and that the interchange fee battle will finally come to an end.” A hearing on final approval is set for September.

130,AXP,AmEx revenue misses estimates as spending growth remains muted,"(Reuters) - Credit card company American Express Co’s (AXP.N) quarterly revenue came in below analysts’ expectations as cardmember spending growth remained muted. Cardmember spending in the first quarter increased 7 percent, adjusted for foreign currency translations. This was the fourth successive quarter of single-digit growth after nine quarters of double-digit growth. Expense accounts have come under greater scrutiny as companies look to cut costs to protect profit margins, hurting the credit card lender, which gets more than a quarter of its U.S. billed business from affluent corporate customers. However, American Express’s billed business was up 6 percent at $224.5 billion and total cards in force crossed 100 million during the quarter. The company has the lowest delinquency rate among the large credit card companies, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), Discover Financial (DFS.N), Capital One (COF.N), Bank of America (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N). It set aside $497 million to cover future bad loans in the quarter, 21 percent more than it had provisioned last year, reflecting its larger lending portfolio. American Express, which lends directly to consumers and also competes with Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) to process credit card transactions, said global network and merchant services revenue increased 4 percent to $1.3 billion. Consolidated expenses during the quarter remained in check, rising marginally, as the company looks to control costs and maintain a leaner operating structure. The company said in January it would cut about 5,400 jobs as part of a global restructuring and took a related $600 million charge. Profit for the quarter ended March 31 rose to $1.28 billion, or $1.15 per share, from $1.26 billion, or $1.07 per share, a year earlier. Total revenue, net of interest expense, increased 4 percent to $7.88 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.12 per share on revenue of $8.03 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. American Express shares were marginally down in trading after the bell.

134,AXP,"Fitch Affirms American Express, Discover and SLM; Outlooks Stable","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has completed a peer review of three  rated consumer finance companies and their related entities. Based on this  review, Fitch has affirmed the long-term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) of  American Express Company (AXP) at ‘A+’, Discover Financial Services (Discover)  at ‘BBB’, and SLM Corporation (SLM) at ‘BBB-‘. A full list of ratings is  provided at the end of this release. The Rating Outlook for all issuers is  Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating affirmations reflect the solid market positions of each issuer in  their respective product categories and the continuation of strong consumer  credit trends, which has supported solid earnings performance and internal  capital generation.  AXP and Discover continue to maintain peer-superior capital ratios and strong  liquidity profiles, with each retaining sufficient cash and liquid securities to  cover funding maturities over the next 12 months. Loss metrics on their credit  card portfolios lead the industry, as do portfolio expansion and purchase volume  growth, which are expected to continue to support solid earnings performance  over the near term. While Fitch believes growth in provision expense will be a  headwind in 2013, Fitch also believes loss metrics will remain well below  historical norms, and the low cost funding environment will serve as a partial  offset to higher credit costs.      AXP’s superior rating continues to reflect its spend-centric business model,  which allowed the company to remain profitable and build capital throughout the  recent credit crisis. In 2012, interchange revenue accounted for approximately  56% of net revenue, while other large credit card firms are much more heavily  reliant on net interest spread for income. AXP has an attractive customer base,  with the highest average spend-per-card in the industry, which Fitch believes  will continue to support billed business growth and earnings.    Credit trends in the private student loan space continue to move in a positive  direction, as tighter underwriting criteria, including higher co-signer rates on  undergraduate loans and increased school certifications, have and will continue  to benefit loan vintages entering repayment. Fitch expects further stabilization  of private student loan credit metrics in 2013, which should yield further  reductions in provision expense for SLM. Discover’s organic student loan  portfolio is still relatively new, and, therefore, Fitch believes loss metrics  will rise modestly as the portfolio seasons.   SLM has demonstrated improved earnings consistency in recent years, despite the  run-off of its federally guaranteed student loan business, given stronger credit  trends on the private education loan side, reduced funding costs, and greater  operational efficiencies. Fitch believes the supply-demand imbalance in the  private student loan industry will benefit players of scale, of which SLM is the  largest, as portfolio growth can be achieved without loosening underwriting  criteria. While legislative risk remains a headline risk, as it pertains to the  dischargeability of private loans in bankruptcy, Fitch believes the impact of a  potential change in legislation is becoming less significant, as portfolio  co-signer rates rise.     Separately, SLM recently completed the sale of a residual interest in an ABS  FFELP transaction, which was relatively modest in size. Fitch does not view the  sale as a change in operating strategy, but as an accelerated realization of  cash proceeds expected from the amortization of the transaction. Cash flows from  servicing the assets will remain intact, as servicing has been retained. Should  residual sales happen on a larger scale, Fitch would expect a portion of cash  proceeds generated from the sale to be used to repay unsecured debt, as a  meaningful portion of the unsecured debt remaining is being used to support the  legacy FFELP business. The use of significant cash proceeds for higher dividend  distributions and/or share repurchases would be viewed negatively from a  creditor’s perspective and could result in a ratings downgrade.    Given strong earnings performance across the consumer sector, aggregate  dividends and share repurchases were significant in the space in 2012, amounting  to payouts of 98% of earnings for AXP, 60% of earnings for Discover, and 107% of  core earnings for SLM. Still, Fitch believes risk-adjusted capitalization levels  remained solid for each. AXP’s ability to generate capital internally, in  particular, is superior given its spend centric business model and focus on fee  revenue. Given current capital positions, Fitch expects AXP and Discover will  retain relatively high payout rates in 2013.       The Stable Rating Outlook for AXP and Discover reflects Fitch’s expectation that  both will continue to generate consistent earnings, exhibit peer-superior asset  quality, and maintain solid liquidity and strong risk-adjusted capitalization.  The Stable Rating Outlook for SLM reflects Fitch’s expectations for consistent  operating performance in consumer lending and business services, sustained  operating efficiencies, stability in credit metrics for the private education  loan portfolio, growing capitalization, with the amortization of the FFELP  portfolio, and the continued ability to repay maturing debt obligations with  operating cash flow and liquidity on hand.  RATING SENSITIVIES - AXP and Discover For AXP and Discover, negative rating action could be driven by an inability to  maintain competitive positions and earnings prospects in an increasingly  digitized payment landscape. While each is focused on strategic acquisitions  and/or alliances to expand online and mobile capabilities, competition from  technology companies and social networks, with access to significant consumer  data, is expected to intensify. Still, a meaningful shift in consumer payment  behavior is expected to take some time to develop. Negative rating momentum for each could also be driven by a decline in earnings  performance, resulting from a decrease in market share, declines in merchant  acceptance, significant credit deterioration or an inability to contain costs, a  weakening liquidity profile, significant reductions in capitalization, and  legislative and/or regulatory changes that alter the earnings prospects of the  credit card business. Fitch believes positive rating momentum is relatively limited for AXP given its  already strong rating and its concentration in payments and consumer products.  For Discover, however, positive rating momentum could develop from increased  revenue diversity, proven competitive positioning and credit performance in  non-card loan categories over time, and enhanced funding flexibility. To date,  positive momentum has been constrained by the continued introduction of new  product categories, where underwriting capabilities are largely untested.  Further seasoning of these new product portfolios will allow Fitch to assess  whether underlying performance alters the risk profile of the firm.   RATING SENSITIVIES - SLM For SLM, negative rating momentum could result from free cash flow generation  below Fitch’s expectations, which impairs the company’s ability to meet its debt  service obligations. As discussed, should FFELP residual sales happen on a  larger scale, Fitch would expect an appropriate portion of cash proceeds to be  used to repay unsecured debt. The use of significant cash proceeds for higher  shareholder distributions, which Fitch believes impairs the company’s ability to  meet unsecured debt maturities, could result in a ratings downgrade.    Negative rating action could also result from deterioration in asset quality  metrics to crisis levels, legislative change which removes the private sector  from the servicing and collection of government guaranteed student loans, and/or  an inability to arrange economically attractive term funding for private  education loans over time. While Fitch believes the impact of the private  student loan dischargeability issue is declining, the ability for a borrower to  discharge their private student loan without a demonstrated payment history,  would not be viewed favorably.  Furthermore, an inability for SLM to regain its market share in the servicing of  government loans through the ED contract, could pressure the ratings. While not  a meaningful portion of revenue or income at present, third-party servicing  income is expected to grow in importance as the owned portfolio runs off. Given  the company’s scalable servicing platform and default performance, Fitch expects  SLM to achieve and maintain a meaningful share of the contract. Conversely, while upward rating momentum is likely limited to the current rating  category, positive rating actions could result from improved consistency of term  liquidity for private education loans, stable credit performance of Smart Option  loan vintages, and measured core earnings expansion over time, resulting from  growth in business services, consistent risk-adjusted margins in the consumer  lending segment, and an increase in third party servicing revenue.

143,AXP,Federal Reserve appeals ruling on swipe fee for debit cards,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday appealed a judge’s decision to reject the agency’s cap on debit card transaction fees, a controversial requirement of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. The Wall Street reform law ordered the Fed to limit “swipe fees,” or the fees banks charge merchants when customers use debit cards. Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in late July that the Fed’s fee cap of 21 cents per transaction was higher than Congress intended. Banking industry groups protested that ruling, saying they need to charge the fees to offset the costs of offering debit cards. The Fed filed its appeal on Wednesday, according to documents posted on the district court’s website. “The Federal Reserve’s decision to appeal is the right thing to do for consumers who value debit cards and the financial institutions that serve them,” Frank Keating, president of the American Bankers Association, said in a statement on Wednesday. Lawmakers included the fee cap in Dodd-Frank in hopes it would trickle down to consumers in the form of lower prices. The Fed set the cap at 21 cents in 2011. Retailers, who had been expecting a much lower limit on swipe fees, complained the Fed had caved to lobbying by banks. The National Retail Federation and other groups filed a lawsuit to overturn the Fed’s cap. The judge’s eventual decision to rule in their favor dragged down shares of card companies Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc. The retail group criticized the Fed’s decision to appeal on Wednesday. “We are very disappointed to see the Fed giving in to the banks,” the group said in a statement. “The Fed has taken a position that will drag this out while retailers and their customers continue to pay billions of dollars in inflated fees.” Visa and MasterCard set the fee level that banks charge retailers for using their networks. Visa shares were up 3 percent at the end of the day on Wednesday, while shares of MasterCard fell slightly. Last week, Judge Leon ordered the Fed to determine whether it could write an interim rule lowering the cap, which would take effect immediately but could be adjusted later, and to report back to him on how long that would take. Scott Alvarez, the Fed’s general counsel, told Leon in court on Wednesday that the agency would prefer to keep the current fee cap in place while it went through the appeals process. Alvarez said it would be unreasonable to ask the Fed to craft new fee limits at the same time that the agency was asking an appeals court to approve its initial cap. Attorneys representing retail groups and banks both said they would have to change their systems to comply with an interim rule, even though an appeals court might wind up validating the original swipe fee cap. “Switching back and forth is something that imposes costs on everybody,” said Seth Waxman, an attorney with WilmerHale. He spoke on behalf of a number of banking industry trade groups, including the American Bankers Association, which were not directly involved in the lawsuit. Alvarez said if Leon did not stay his ruling, the Fed would ask the appeals court to do so. Leon said he would “keep an open mind” as he considered it.

147,AXP,American Express profit rises as corporate spending picks up,"(Reuters) - American Express Co posted a better-than-expected 9 percent rise in quarterly profit as spending by corporate card users began to pick up after more than a year of sluggish growth. A relatively affluent customer base has helped to insulate American Express from tepid consumer spending that has led to an overall decline in credit card usage in the United States. The company, which has fewer defaulting customers than rival credit card issuers, said on Wednesday that it had not suffered any direct impact from the U.S. government shutdown. “They largely cater to a consumer base who would likely be less sensitive to the fallout from what’s going on in Washington DC,” said Sameer Gokhale, an analyst at Janney Capital Markets. For the third quarter ended September 30, American Express said spending on its cards rose 9 percent after adjusting for foreign currency translations — the biggest jump in five quarters. The company, which lends directly to consumers and competes with Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc to process credit card transactions, said its U.S.-billed business rose 8 percent to $158.2 billion. Chief Financial Officer Jeff Campbell said he was encouraged by the reversal of a trend that had seen growth in corporate card spending lose momentum since the second quarter of 2012. Speaking on his first post-earnings conference call since taking over from Daniel Henry, Campbell also said it was important that a deal be reached soon to resolve the U.S. budget impasse. “The alternative is an outcome that would erode consumer confidence and jeopardize a still-uncertain economic recovery,” he said. U.S. lawmakers are set to vote late Wednesday on a bipartisan Senate deal to break the fiscal impasse in Washington and avert a historic debt default, hours before the government’s borrowing authority is set to run out. American Express has the lowest delinquency rate among the biggest credit card issuers, which include JPMorgan Chase, Discover Financial, Capital One, Bank of America and Citigroup. Its net-lending write-off rate for the quarter dropped to a low of 1.7 percent, compared with 1.9 percent in the year-earlier period, indicating that more customers were keeping up with card payments. Net profit rose to $1.37 billion, or $1.25 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, above analysts’ expectations of $1.22 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue, net of interest expense, rose 6 percent to $8.30 billion, beating average Wall Street estimates for the first time in five quarters. Shares of American Express, which has a market valuation of $81.2 billion, have risen about 30 percent this year, outperforming a 19 percent rise on the broader S&P; 500 Index. They were up marginally in extended trading after closing at $76.32 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

Shares of Intel Corp lost 4.7 percent to $25.29 to weigh on each of the three major U.S. indexes after fourth quarter earnings missed expectations by a penny due to weak spending on servers. The chipmaker gave a lukewarm forecast for first-quarter revenue. General Electric Co lost 2.8 percent to $26.44. The conglomerate posted a slightly better-than-expected rise in revenue on Friday propelled by its businesses selling oil pumps and jet engines. But American Express Co was a bright spot, climbing 4.9 percent to $92.06. The credit card company gave the biggest boost to the Dow and S&P; 500 after reporting strong quarterly results after the close on Thursday. “The market is frustrated at the moment, there is no reason to push higher,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. “There are mixed earnings and even the ones that are coming in stronger, people are taking advantage and using those as sources of cash, so they are taking some money off the table, which is just holding us here.” Morgan Stanley rose 3.9 percent to $33.26. The Wall Street bank reported a sharp fall in quarterly profit as it was hit by legal bills but adjusted earnings beat estimates. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 28.12 points or 0.17 percent, to 16,445.13, the S&P; 500 lost 2.57 points or 0.14 percent, to 1,843.32 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 8.311 points or 0.2 percent, to 4,210.377. After surging 30 percent in 2013, largely due to stimulus from the Federal Reserve, the S&P; 500 started the year on a weak note but recovered recently to set a new record high Wednesday. It is now roughly flat for the year. Housing starts fell less than expected in December, as data showed a 9.8 percent drop, the largest percentage decline since April, to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of a 999,000-unit pace. Economists polled by Reuters had expected starts to fall to a 990,000-unit rate. The PHLX housing sector index  lost 0.7 percent. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s preliminary reading of consumer sentiment came in at 80.4, down from 82.5 in December, weighed by lowered expectations among lower- and middle-income families.

154,AXP,UPDATE 2-American Express says exposure to Target breach 'minimal',"* Fourth-quarter adjusted earnings $1.25/share vs est. $1.26/share * Revenue up 5 pct at $8.55 bln * Says has fraud controls on accounts affected by Target breach By Aman Shah Jan 16 (Reuters) - Credit card company American Express Co , which reported strong quarterly results on Thursday, said it had seen ‘minimal exposure’ to the data breach at Target Corp stores during the U.S. holiday shopping season. American Express said it had fraud controls in place on accounts affected in the theft, one of the biggest card breaches on record. About 40 million credit card records and 70 million other records containing data on Target’s customers were stolen in the breach disclosed in December. “The closed-loop is a big advantage for us, especially in situations like this,” Chief Financial Officer Jeff Campbell said on a post-earnings conference call, referring to the company’s system of issuing its own cards in addition to processing transactions. Earlier in the day, American Express reported a two-fold jump in fourth-quarter profit as its affluent customers spent more in the U.S. holiday season and fewer users defaulted on payments. “We ended the year on a strong note, with card member spending up 8 percent despite mixed reports during the holiday shopping season,” Chief Executive Ken Chenault said in a statement. Concerns over debit and credit card safety have increased after Target, the third-largest U.S. retailer, disclosed the breach that lasted 19 days through Dec. 15. Cards on American Express’s platform are seen as safer than those on Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc platforms due to the ‘closed loop’ system. American Express benefited from the holiday shopping season in the United States, with billed business in its core market growing 9 percent in the quarter ended Dec. 31, the highest growth in six quarters. “Even though overall growth in consumer spending has been somewhat muted, the fact that American Express focuses on affluent consumers is helping it grow its billed business,” said Janney Capital Markets analyst Sameer Gokhale. U.S. retail sales increased 3.8 percent in the 2013 holiday season, according to data released by the National Retail Federation on Tuesday. The same day, the U.S. Commerce Department said retail sales including automobiles, gasoline stations and restaurants rose 1 percent from a year earlier in the October-December period. () American Express, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, said fewer customers defaulted on payments in the quarter, with worldwide net lending write-off rate falling to 1.6 percent from 2 percent, a year earlier. Delinquency rates at credit card companies usually rise in the fourth quarter as customers spend more during the holiday season and then find it difficult to repay loans.

155,AXP,American Express clinches $900 million joint venture investment,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American Express Co (AXP.N) said on Monday that four financial investors have committed a total of $900 million to a business travel joint venture, in what would be the largest single investment ever made in a travel management company. The deal highlights some of the challenges facing the world’s biggest credit card issuer, as tighter corporate budgets weigh on its business travel division, which helps employees of companies with their travel arrangements. Certares LP, the investment firm founded by former JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) dealmaker and private equity veteran Greg O’Hara, will be joined by Qatar Investment Authority, BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and Macquarie Capital (MQG.AX) in the joint venture. Qatar Investment Authority will have a bigger stake in the joint venture than the other three investors, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to publicly disclose this detail. The deal underscores the sovereign wealth fund’s new appetite for private equity-type direct investments in U.S.-based companies. American Express said in September it was in talks to sell half of its business travel division for up to $1 billion to an investor group led by Certares. The company’s consumer travel business will not be a part of the deal. On Monday, American Express said an agreement had been reached and revealed the identity of those involved. It will own half of the joint venture, with the four financial investors owning the remainder, according to a statement by the company.

157,AXP,UPDATE 3-Big credit card issuers defeat collusion lawsuit in U.S.,"* American Express, Citigroup, Discover prevail * Cardholders alleged collusion to require arbitration   (Adds comments from Citigroup, Discover lawyer) By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK, April 10 (Reuters) - Consumers suffered a setback on Thursday as three big credit card issuers won the dismissal of U.S. lawsuits accusing them of colluding to require that disputes be settled in arbitration rather than class action lawsuits. U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan said cardholders failed to show that American Express Co, Citigroup Inc and Discover Financial Services  conspired to violate the Sherman antitrust law. The plaintiffs had argued that the conspiracy ran from May 1999 to October 2003, when 10 card-issuing banks and their lawyers held 28 meetings to discuss how to impose mandatory arbitration clauses in cardholder agreements. Pauley said his decision in the decade-old case was a close call, given the “conscious parallel action” among the biggest card issuers to include the clauses. “It was only by a slender reed that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the lawyers who organized these meetings had spawned a Sherman Act conspiracy among their clients,” Pauley wrote in a 92-page decision, following a 2013 non-jury trial. Class action litigation can allow consumers to pool resources and obtain greater recoveries at lower cost than individual arbitrations. “This is a big dent for consumer rights,” said Curtis Arnold, a consumer advocate and founder of CardRatings.com in Little Rock, Arkansas. “Class action lawsuits have over the years kept this industry in check. Individuals don’t have much recourse taking on card giants by themselves.” Cardholders had sought to force American Express, Citigroup and Discover to remove arbitration clauses from their cardholder agreements for eight years. Merrill Davidoff, a partner at Berger & Montague representing the plaintiffs, said his clients were “obviously disappointed” and strongly disagreed with Pauley’s decision. He said it is premature to address whether there will be an appeal. Robert Sperling, a partner at Winston & Strawn representing Discover, said the cardholders “never came close to proving collusion.” Citigroup spokeswoman Emily Collins said that the bank is pleased with the decision. Spokeswomen for American Express did not respond to requests for comment. American Express, Citigroup and Discover collectively held about 31.1 percent of U.S. outstanding credit card balances in 2013, according to the Nilson Report. In April 2010, Bank of America Corp, Capital One Financial Corp, HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co settled with the plaintiff cardholders by agreeing to remove their arbitration clauses for 3-1/2 years. The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimated in December that just over 50 percent of outstanding credit card loans remain subject to the clauses. It said the percentage would have been 94 percent absent the earlier settlements. Other industries also use arbitration clauses. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2011 upheld contracts used by AT&T; Inc  requiring consumers to arbitrate disputes individually. In his decision, Pauley noted that of the 10 banks that had been part of the litigation, just two had mandatory arbitration clauses at the start of the alleged collusion. He found “compelling evidence” that cardholders would have little economic incentive to fight alleged abuses absent class actions, and said that the banks’ “need to parry consumer backlash and temper any ‘rogue’ players” established a motive to conspire. “A motive to conspire, however, does not mean that a conspiracy existed,” he said. “This court is convinced that the evidence is just as consistent with legitimate activity in furtherance of the issuing banks’ independent self interests.” Pauley said the case also offered a “cautionary lesson” to lawyers, given that the banks’ cost to defend against the lawsuits offset potential savings from the arbitration clauses. “In retrospect, the issuing banks’ short-term goal of lowering litigation costs eluded them,” he wrote. The cases are in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York. They are Ross et al v. American Express Co et al, No. 04-05723; and Ross et al v. Bank of America NA et al, No. 05-07116.

159,AXP,Leash on expenses helps AmEx counter muted user spending,"(Reuters) - American Express Co’s (AXP.N) quarterly profit beat analysts’ average estimate as a tighter control on expenses helped make up for slower growth in consumer spending in its key U.S. market. The world’s biggest credit card issuer said an unusually severe winter caused billed business in the United States to rise 6 percent in the first quarter, lower than the 9 percent growth in the preceding quarter. However, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Campbell said on a post-earnings conference call that the business had grown through the second half of the quarter as the weather improved. U.S. retail sales increased 1.1 percent in March — the biggest gain since September 2012 — in a sign that the economy is bouncing back after the severe winter. “While consumers remain cautious about taking on additional debt, we continued to see a modest increase in card member loan balances” CEO Kenneth Chenault said in a statement. For a graphic on the company's U.S. billed business growth over the past four years, click (link.reuters.com/dyx58v) American Express, which issues its own cards unlike rivals such as Visa Inc (V.N) and Mastercard Inc (MA.N), benefits from its largely affluent customers’ consistent spending and low default rates. The company’s focus on affluent consumers should help drive growth as such customers in the United States spend 6 times more on their cards, Janney Capital Markets analyst Sameer Gokhale wrote in a note in February. The United States accounts for about two-thirds of American Express’s total billed business. The company’s net income rose 12 percent to $1.43 billion, or $1.33 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.30 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue, net of interest expense, rose 4 percent to $8.20 billion but fell short of Wall Street expectations of $8.36 billion. Overall spending by the company’s card users rose 7 percent, adjusted for foreign currency, while consolidated expenses fell by 1 percent to $5.5 billion. “They (American Express) have been trying to control expenses quite a bit and the run rate of expenses is below what we’ve seen in quite a few quarters,” Gokhale said. American Express in March spun off half of its business travel division into a joint venture with four financial investors as companies cut their budgets to protect profit margins. CFO Campbell said that while the company still expects the deal to close in the second quarter, delays in getting approvals could push back this quarter’s earnings release. The company had said it would increase its quarterly dividend by 13 percent to 26 cents per share and buy back up to $4.4 billion of stock in 2014 after it passed the Federal Reserve’s annual stress test in March. The company’s shares were unchanged at $87.40 in extended trading on Wednesday. They have risen 35 percent in the past year, outperforming the Dow’s 11 percent gain.

161,AXP,Fitch Affirms American Express; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 16 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed American Express Company's  (AXP) long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' and short-term IDR at 'F1'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable.  A full list of ratings is detailed at the end of  this release.  The ratings affirmation reflects AXP's strong franchise, spend-centric business  model, leading market position in the payments industry, strong credit  performance, consistent profitability, diverse funding base, ample liquidity,  and strong risk-adjusted capitalization. Ratings are constrained by limited  revenue diversity and heightened legislative scrutiny of consumer products. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch expects operating performance to continue to improve in 2014 supported by  growth in consumer and business spending, an expanding Card Member base, and  expense discipline. Fitch also expects the company to continue to invest in the  franchise including strategic initiatives to expand key businesses (e.g. OPEN,  Merchant Services, Serve, Bluebird) and develop new products and services. That  said, some headwinds remain including a challenging economic backdrop,  particularly in the U.S. and Europe, increased regulatory oversight, and intense  competition from both traditional and alternative payment providers. Credit performance is expected to remain strong in 2014 although charge-offs and  delinquencies will likely start to increase from historically low levels. Fitch  expects provision expenses to increase in 2014 driven by portfolio growth, lower  reserve releases, and some modest deterioration in credit metrics. Net  charge-offs on the lending portfolio improved 30 basis points (bps) to 1.8% in  2013 and were below other top credit card issuers. Reserve coverage remains  strong at 1.9% of loans and 169% of loans past due at Dec. 31, 2013.  Capital ratios remained strong in 2013. The Tier I common ratio grew 60 bps to  12.5% in 2013 and the TCE/TA ratio improved 50 bps to 10.4% in 2013. Both  metrics compare favorably to peer banks. Fitch expects capital ratios to remain  stable as earnings generation is offset by asset growth and return of capital to  shareholders (e.g. dividends, stock repurchases). AXP's liquidity profile remains a rating strength, with approximately $13  billion (excluding CP and operating cash) of readily available cash and  marketable securities at Dec. 31, 2013 to fund $12.5 billion of long-term debt  and CD maturities over the next 12 months. The parent company has $1.3 billion  of unsecured debt maturities in 2014, which compares to cash and equivalents and  investment securities of $6.2 billion at year-end 2013 which Fitch believes is  more than adequate to cover dividend and interest payments for the year. RATING SENSITIVITIES Limited Upside in Ratings: Fitch believes positive rating momentum is relatively  limited, given the company's strong ratings currently, concentrated exposure to  consumers and focus on payment services.  Deteriorating Operating Performance: Negative rating action could be driven by a  decline in earnings performance, resulting from a decrease in market share or an  inability to contain costs, a weakening liquidity profile, significant  reductions in capitalization, and/or potential new and more onerous rules and  regulations. Negative rating momentum could also be driven by an inability of  AXP to maintain its competitive position and earnings prospects in an  increasingly digitized payment landscape. Fitch has taken the following rating actions:  American Express Company -- Long-term IDR affirmed at 'A+'; -- Short-term IDR affirmed at 'F1'; -- Short-term debt affirmed at 'F1'; -- Senior debt affirmed at 'A+'; -- Hybrid capital instrument affirmed at 'BBB'; -- Viability Rating affirmed at 'a+'; -- Support affirmed at '5'; and -- Support Floor affirmed at 'NF'. American Express Credit Corp. -- Long-term IDR affirmed at 'A+'; -- Short-term IDR affirmed at 'F1'; -- Short-term debt affirmed at 'F1'; and -- Senior debt affirmed at 'A+'.

American Express Bank, FSB -- Long-term IDR affirmed at 'A+'; -- Short-term IDR affirmed at 'F1'; -- Senior debt affirmed at 'A+'; -- Long-term deposits affirmed at 'AA-'. -- Short-term deposits affirmed at 'F1+'; -- Viability Rating affirmed at 'a+'; -- Support affirmed at '5'; and -- Support Floor affirmed at 'NF'.

163,AXP,American Express quarterly profit rises as U.S. card holders spend more,"(Reuters) - American Express Co, the world’s largest credit card issuer, reported an 8.1 percent rise in quarterly profit due to higher spending by U.S. customers using its credit cards and a rise in its net interest income.  Spending by U.S. holders of AmEx cards rose 9 percent in the third quarter, boosting profit in the business by 14 percent. The business accounted for nearly three-quarters of the company’s profit.  U.S. consumer spending rose 0.5 percent in August after being unchanged in July, the Commerce Department said last month.  AmEx, which issues its own cards unlike Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc that work through banks, benefits from its largely affluent customer base and low rates of default. However, single-digit growth in spending by its card users for about two years has pushed the company to launch products such as a fee-free card that targets a wider range of customers. The company’s net income rose to $1.48 billion, or $1.40 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $1.37 billion, or $1.25 per share, a year earlier.  Net interest income rose 8.7 percent to $1.4 billion. However, total revenue, net of interest expense, remained nearly unchanged at $8.33 billion. Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault said AmEx’s revenue was growing at a pace below the company’s long-term target. “While the economy is stronger, it is not growing as fast or as steadily as most people would like,” he said in a statement. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.36 per share and revenue of $8.35 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. AmEx’s shares closed at $80.93 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

165,AXP,American Express says Vente-Privee USA to close by year-end,"Oct 27 (Reuters) - American Express Co, the world’s largest credit card issuer, said it would close its joint venture with French online start-up Vente-Privee by the end of the year. Vente-Privee sells luxury fashion, wine and music at steep discounts in “flash sales” that last three to five days. Vente-Privee began operating in the United States in 2011 in a joint venture with American Express to access an affluent client base of card holders, giving it instant credibility and brand recognition despite not being a household name outside Europe. “Both companies decided that given the road to profitability for vente-privee USA was going to be longer than expected, it was time to focus on other priorities,” American Express’ spokeswoman Leah Gerstner said in an email. Vente-Privee USA will continue to operate and fulfil its sales events and customer orders through the end of the year, the spokeswoman said. Launched in 2001, Vente-Privee has grown fast and is now one of Europe’s biggest homegrown online retailers, with a presence in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the UK, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands.

166,AXP,Fitch Rates American Express' Preferred Share Issuance 'BBB-',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 10 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of 'BBB-' to  the $750  million in preferred stock issued by American Express Company (AXP,  rated 'A+/F1' by Fitch). This preferred issuance represents approximately 1% of  AXP's total risk-weighted assets at Sept. 30, 2014. AXP had previously stated that it would issue preferred shares for Basel III  capital planning purposes. More specifically, the new Tier 1 ratio requirement  under Basel III is 150 basis points higher than the current common equity Tier 1  ratio and regulators have started using the new minimums to assess capital  adequacy in the CCAR process. Fitch believes AXP's strategy is consistent with other large financial  institutions which have included preferred stock in their non-common Tier 1  capital structures. KEY RATING DRIVERS - Preferred Shares AXP's preferred stock rating is five notches below the entity's Viability Rating  (VR) of 'a+' in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's  respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk profile. The  preferred stock rating includes two notches for loss severity given these  securities deep subordination in the capital structure, and three notches for  non-performance given that the coupon of the securities is non-cumulative and  fully discretionary. Fitch has accorded these preferred securities equity credit of 50%, which is in  line with its methodology in assessing and rating bank subordinated and hybrid  securities. RATING SENSITIVITIES - Preferred Shares The preferred stock ratings are directly linked to AXP's VR and would move in  tandem with any changes in AXP's credit profile.

167,AXP,"Fitch: AmEx, Discover Can Manage EU Card Interchange Fee Caps","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 13 (Fitch) Draft terms agreed to by the European Parliament  and the European Council in December that cap interchange fees on some European  debit and credit card transactions will likely have a manageable financial  impact on American Express (AmEx, 'A+') and Discover Financial Services  (Discover, 'BBB+'), Fitch Ratings says.  We expect that the effect will also be manageable but more felt at banks with  operations concentrated in the EU that issue payment cards on the Visa and  MasterCard networks. However, the interchange fee caps have been widely  anticipated, and we believe that issuers have had time to prepare for the impact  on revenue. Fitch believes increased regulation could have some unintended consequences. For  example, card members could face higher fees and/or reduced benefits as banks  re-assess these programs and seek to maintain appropriate profitability targets.  Fitch believes these could potentially take the form of annual membership fees,  account maintenance or other fees and/or more limited rewards. At the same time,  it remains unclear if merchants will be willing to pass through the savings to  consumers.  According to the European Commission, the new rules would introduce maximum fees  for consumer debit and credit cards and establish transparency rules for all  transactions, among other points. The agreement is in line with expectations  that interchange fees paid by merchants will become capped at 0.2% for debit  card transactions and 0.3% for credit card purchases. The primary targets of the  proposals are four-party payment networks (e.g. Visa and MasterCard), although  three-party payments systems that rely on bank issuers are also likely included  in the new rules. Three-party systems that rely on bank issuers would include  AmEx's Global Network Services (GNS) business and Discover's Diner's Club,  although neither is a material earnings contributor to their respective  franchises. The core proprietary card businesses of Amex and Discover (which do  not rely on bank issuers), are not included in the recent agreement, consistent  with the prior proposal. The agreement remains subject to final endorsement by EU member states and by  the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, before being put to a vote by the  full Parliament, which is expected in early 2015, according to the European  Commission. The caps are expected to take effect six months after the  legislation enters into force.

The planned redundancies, from a workforce of nearly 63,000, contributed to a $313 million pre-tax restructuring charge taken by the world’s largest credit card issuer during the fourth quarter. The company’s shares fell 2.3 percent to $85.62 after the bell. American Express, which in recent years has been reining in costs to counter sluggish revenue growth, said expenses rose 3.5 percent to $3.60 billion in the fourth quarter, driven mainly by marketing costs and salaries. Total provisions for loan losses increased 21.5 percent to $582 million. Another credit card issuer, Discover Financial Services Inc , reported a 33 percent drop in quarterly profit as it set aside more money to cover bad loans. The job cuts announced by American Express will take place in the United States and abroad. “The actions we are taking will impact over 4,000 people at a cost of $313 million in the quarter,” Chief Financial Officer Jeff Campbell said on a post-earnings conference call, referring to the planned job cuts. The company had 62,800 employees at the end of 2013, according to its latest annual report. Four thousand jobs would constitute about 6 percent of its workforce, but Campbell said the cuts will be offset partly by the creation of some new jobs.

174,AXP,Costco to ditch AmEx cards at U.S. stores next year,"(Reuters) - Warehouse club retailer Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) will stop accepting American Express Co’s (AXP.N) credit cards at U.S. stores from next year, threatening nearly 8 percent of the worldwide annual spending on its cards. AmEx said on Thursday the loss of the contract would hurt earnings for the next two years, sending its shares down as much as 7 percent and wiping out about $6 billion of market value. JPMorgan Securities analyst Tien-tsin Huang said the loss of Costco would reduce spending on AmEx cards by about $80 billion a year, including their use at businesses other than Costco’s 468 stores in the United States and Puerto Rico. AmEx said it expected earnings per share growth in 2015 to be flat to down modestly from 2014 as the company invests aggressively to prepare for the termination of the contract. The agreement between AmEx and Costco is set to end after 16 years on March 31, 2016. Costco warehouses in the United States currently accept only American Express cards. “We were unable to reach terms that would have made economic sense for our company and shareholders,” American Express CEO Kenneth Chenault said in a statement. Competition in the co-branded card business has intensified in recent years, leading to higher renewal costs, Chenault said on a conference call. Costco declined to comment on the move, which follows its decision to drop AmEx in Canada last year. Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) replaced AmEx as Costco’s card partner in Canada, raising speculation that the companies could also replace AmEx in the United States. Capital One, whose shares were up 2.6 percent in early afternoon trading, did not respond to a request for comment. MasterCard’s shares were up 2.7 percent. American Express renewed co-branded contracts with Delta Airlines Inc (DAL.N), Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc HOT.N and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (0293.HK) in 2014. Costco, which sells everything from jewelry to fresh produce at its cavernous members-only stores, reported revenue of $112.64 billion for its fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 2014.

179,AXP,American Express card rules violated U.S. antitrust law: judge,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American Express Co violated U.S. antitrust law by prohibiting merchants from steering consumers to use lower-cost credit cards, a federal judge ruled on Thursday, in the company’s second major setback this month. The decision by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn followed American Express’ loss on Feb. 12 of a lucrative, exclusive partnership with warehouse retailer Costco Wholesale Corp. It is also a victory for the U.S. government and 17 states, which in 2010 sued American Express over allegations it forbade merchants from recommending to consumers which cards to use. The New York-based company’s activities “imposed actual, concrete harms on competition in the credit and charge card network services market,” Garaufis wrote in a 150-page decision. He said he will decide on remedies later. American Express shares fell 1.7 percent. Card companies charge merchants more than $50 billion a year to process consumer transactions, the government said. Those fees have also spurred many years of litigation by the merchants themselves against the card companies. “Today’s decision is a triumph for fair competition and for American consumers,” U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. “By recognizing that American Express’s rules harm competition, the court vindicates the promise of robust marketplaces that is enshrined in our antitrust laws.” American Express said it will appeal, and that Garaufis’ decision would harm competition by “further entrenching the two dominant payment networks,” Visa and MasterCard. “We believe that freedom of choice and fair competition are worth defending,” American Express said. Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc had also been sued by the various governments over their “anti-steering” rules for merchants, but settled in 2011 by agreeing to make changes. “Large retailers can save a good chunk of money by encouraging customers to use cards like Visa and MasterCard,” said Matt Schulz, senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com, an online marketplace. “If a large retailer can go from paying 5 percent on a transaction to even 4 percent, that is a lot.” American Express has said its “premium” services justify its processing fees, which are higher than some rivals charge. It also said its merchant rules help it compete with Visa and MasterCard, which together have more than 1.1 billion cards in the United States versus 55 million for American Express. Garaufis, however, said American Express wrongfully exploited its 26.4 percent share of purchase volume in the U.S. credit and charge card market by banning merchants from giving incentives for consumers to use one card over another, or telling consumers they might be better off if they did. “There is nothing to offset credit card networks’ incentives - including American Express’s incentive - to charge merchants inflated prices for their services,” the judge wrote. “This, in turn, results in higher costs to all consumers who purchase goods and services from these merchants.” Douglas Kantor, a partner at Steptoe & Johnson who represents the National Association of Convenience Stores,  welcomed the decision. “It ought to open up the marketplace for more price competition where there isn’t any at all today,” he said in an interview. “That helps merchants and consumers, because it can help keep prices down, and spur spending and economic activity.” Richard Dagen, an antitrust partner at Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider, said the decision may make it easier for small or new rivals to compete with American Express, Visa and MasterCard. “You might have a chance for someone like Discover to make inroads,” he said, referring to Discover Financial Services. “Whenever that happens, you’re likely to see lower prices for the merchants, which hopefully get passed on to consumers.” Garaufis ruled after presiding over a seven-week non-jury trial last summer. The lawsuit sought to force American Express to give merchants who accept its cards the freedom to encourage consumers “to use any payment method they choose.” No money damages were sought, but American Express has said a loss could have a “material adverse effect” on its business. That could add to the loss of earnings stemming from the demise of its partnership with Costco, which began in 1999 and will end in March 2016. American Express is the only credit payment form accepted at Costco’s U.S. stores. Costco last year decided to replace American Express as its card partner in Canada with MasterCard and Capital One Financial Corp. Shares of American Express closed down $1.38 at $78.40.

Last month, Costco Wholesale Corp said it would stop accepting AmEx cards after it failed to renew a deal. The agreement between AmEx and Costco is set to end after 16 years on March 31, 2016. AmEx said the loss of the Costco contract would hurt earnings for the next two years. It raised interest rates for over 1 million of its cardholders for the first time in more than five years last month.

189,AXP,Fitch Affirms American Express at 'A+/F1'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 08 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed American Express Company's  (AXP) long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' and its short-term IDR at  'F1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the  end of this release.  AXP's rating review was conducted as part of Fitch's periodic peer review of  U.S. consumer finance companies. For a summary of the outcomes and drivers of  this peer review please see the release entitled 'Fitch Affirms Five U.S.  Consumer Finance Companies Following Peer Review' dated April 8, 2015.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, Subordinated Debt, Preferred Shares, Support Ratings,  Support Rating Floors, VRs, Deposits The rating affirmations reflect AXP's strong franchise, spend-centric business  model, leading market position in the payments industry, peer-superior credit  performance, consistent profitability, diverse funding base, ample liquidity,  and strong risk-adjusted capitalization.  Rating constraints include AXP's concentrated and cyclical business model,  potential funding sensitivity associated with wholesale and internet deposit  funding sources, the likelihood of asset quality reversion from current levels.  The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's view that AXP's favourable business model  and strong competitive position afford it a degree of operational and financial  flexibility to respond to recent challenges associated with AXP's loss of the  Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco, 'A+', Outlook Positive) relationship, and  continued elevated regulatory, legislative and litigation risk.  Fitch expects AXP's operating performance to remain under a degree of pressure  over the near term reflecting a number of headwinds including lackluster modest  global economic growth, normalizing credit performance, the loss of the Costco  relationship, a stronger U.S. dollar and continued heightened regulatory,  legislative and litigation risk. Despite these challenges, Fitch believes AXP's longer-term operating performance  will remain strong supported by the company's favourable business model and  competitive position, the continued shift in global payments away from cash and  checks, an expanding Card Member base, and expense discipline. Fitch also  expects the company to continue to innovate and invest in new opportunities that  complement its existing competitive strengths. Credit performance is expected to remain among the strongest of other top credit  card issuers in 2015, although charge-offs and delinquencies will likely start  to normalize. Fitch expects provision expenses to increase in 2015 driven  primarily by portfolio seasoning and growth, as well as some modest  deterioration in credit metrics. Net charge-offs on the lending portfolio  improved 30 basis points (bps) to 1.5% in 2014 and remained well below other top  credit card issuers and the industry average. Reserve coverage remained strong  at 1.7% of loans and 167% of loans past due at Dec. 31, 2014.  The impact from rising interest rates is expected to be manageable for AXP. At  Dec. 31, 2014, assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates,  AXP estimates that net interest income (NII) over the following 12-month period  would decrease by approximately $212 million. This estimated decline in NII  primarily relates to non-interest bearing charge card receivables and fixed rate  credit card loans that are funded with variable rate debt. As of Dec. 31, 2014,  fixed rate worldwide charge card receivables and credit card loans accounted for  approximately 67% of AXP's total portfolio. Regulatory capital ratios improved further from already strong levels in 2014.  The Tier I capital ratio increased 110 bps to 13.6% in 2014 and the Tier I  common ratio grew 60 bps to 13.1% in 2014. Both metrics compare favorably to  peer banks. Additionally, AXP performed very well relative to peers in the  Federal Reserve's most recent Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).  As part of this review, AXP received a non-objection related to its capital plan  submitted in January 2015. Fitch expects capital ratios to remain relatively  stable as strong capital generation is offset by asset growth and return of  capital to shareholders (e.g. dividends, stock repurchases). AXP's liquidity profile remains a rating strength. AXP had $15.2 billion  (excluding CP and operating cash) of readily available cash and marketable  securities at Dec. 31, 2014. This compared to $13.4 billion of long-term debt  and CD maturities over the next 12 months. Furthermore, the parent company has  no unsecured debt maturities in 2015, which compares to cash and equivalents and  investment securities of $8.8 billion at year-end 2014. On Feb. 12, 2015 AXP announced that it would not renew its U.S. co-brand  relationship with Costco. AXP expects the loss of the Costco U.S. contract to  have a negative impact on earnings and revenue growth after the contract expires  in March 2016. However, the company reiterated its long-term earnings per share  growth target of between 12% and 15% beginning in 2017.  Fitch believes AXP will pursue other investment opportunities including within  consumer and small business payments, prepaid products, global network services  (GNS) bank partnerships, and new co-brand relationships in an effort to offset  the long-term loss of earnings from the Costco relationship. For example, on  March 19, 2015 AXP announced a new exclusive multi-year partnership with Charles  Schwab & Co., Inc. ('A', Outlook Stable) to create two new premium co-branded  cards.  Fitch views AXP's decision not to renew such an important relationship as an  understandable outcome when seeking to balance long term economic value and  short-term results. Although near term earnings will be pressured, Fitch  believes AXP's strong franchise, spend-centric business model and leading market  position in the payments industry position it well to achieve its long term  operating performance targets. For a more in-depth review of the implications related to this announcement,  please refer to Fitch's press release 'Loss of Co-Branding Relationship Adds to  Near-Term Challenges Facing Amex' published on Feb. 17, 2015. On Feb. 19, 2015, the United States District Court in the Eastern District of  New York ruled in favor of the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) in its  anti-steering case against AXP. AXP has moved to bring its case to the appellate  court and believes it will prevail on appeal. Fitch believes losing the DOJ lawsuit (for now) is a credit negative and adds to  AXP's near term challenges. That said, in a scenario where the ruling is upheld  Fitch believes the longer term impact on AXP's business model and operating  performance could be modest. While Fitch believes allowing merchant steering  could negatively impact AXP's billed business volumes, it is unclear how many  merchants would actually steer customers at the point of sale. In Fitch's  opinion, merchants will need to prudently manage the trade-offs between customer  satisfaction, sales volume and transaction pricing when making the decision to  steer customers to lower cost forms of payment. That said, if merchant steering  becomes widespread, Fitch would need to evaluate the impact on AXP's market  share and merchant discount revenue, which accounted for 57% of net operating  revenue in 2014. The ratings for AXP and its subsidiaries are equalized, which reflects Fitch's  view that each subsidiary is core and integral to AXP's business strategy and  operations. Fitch believes AXP would fully support each of these subsidiaries in  the event of need. The Support Ratings (SRs) of '5' reflect Fitch's view that external support  cannot be relied upon. The Support Rating Floors (SRFs) of 'No Floor' reflect  Fitch's view that there is no reasonable assumption that sovereign support will  be forthcoming to AXP. AXP's subordinated debt rating is one notch below the entity's Viability Rating  (VR) of 'a+' in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's  respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk profile. The  subordinated note rating includes one notch for loss severity given the  subordination of these securities in the capital structure, and zero notches for  non-performance given contractual limitations on interest payment deferrals and  no mandatory trigger events which could adversely impact performance. AXP's preferred stock ratings are five notches below the AXP's VR of 'a+' in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instruments respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profile. The preferred stock  ratings include two notches for loss severity given these securities deep  subordination in the capital structure, and three notches for non-performance  given that the coupons of these securities are non-cumulative and fully  discretionary. AXP Centurion Bank's and AXP Bank, FSB's uninsured deposit ratings of 'AA-/F1+'  are rated one notch higher than their respective IDR's because U.S. uninsured  deposits benefit from depositor preference in the U.S. Fitch believes depositor  preference in the U.S. gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in  the event of default. RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, Subordinated Debt, Preferred Shares, Support  Ratings, Support Rating Floors, VRs, Deposits Fitch believes positive rating momentum is relatively limited, given the AXP's  strong ratings currently, concentrated exposure to consumers and focus on  payment services. That said, longer-term positive rating momentum could  potentially be driven by successful navigation of current regulatory,  partnership and competitive/technological challenges, increased earnings  diversification that results in less cyclical financial performance, and  enhanced funding diversity/stability, particularly with respect to  internet-based deposits.  Negative rating action could be driven by a material decline in AXP's franchise,  which may be evidenced by discount rate erosion, declines in volumes or loss of  market share, among other factors. Other negative drivers could include  weakening earnings performance, resulting from a decrease in market share,  sustained deterioration in credit performance, the loss of key partner  relationships, increased merchant steering or an inability to contain costs, a  weakening liquidity profile, significant reductions in capitalization, and/or  potential new and more onerous rules and regulations. Negative rating momentum  could also be driven by an inability of AXP to maintain its competitive position  and earnings prospects in an increasingly digitized payment landscape. AXP's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to Fitch's  assumptions around capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of need.  The subordinated debt ratings are directly linked to AXP's VR and would move in  tandem with any changes in AXP's credit profile. The preferred stock ratings are directly linked to AXP's VR and would move in  tandem with any changes in AXP's credit profile. AXP Centurion Bank and AXP Bank, FSB's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one  notch higher than each company's IDR, and therefore are sensitive to any changes  in their respective IDR's. The deposit ratings are primarily sensitive to any  change in AXP's long- and short-term IDRs. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  American Express Company --Long-term IDR at 'A+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Short-term debt at 'F1'; --Senior debt at 'A+'; --6.80% Subordinated Debentures due September 2036 at 'BBB'; --3.625% Subordinated Notes due Dec 2024 at 'A'; --Preferred Shares, Series B at 'BBB-'; --Preferred Shares, Series C at 'BBB-'; --Viability Rating at 'a+'; --Support at '5'; --Support Floor at 'NF'. American Express Credit Corp. --Long-term IDR at 'A+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Short-term debt at 'F1'; --Senior debt at 'A+'. American Express Centurion Bank --Long-term IDR at 'A+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Senior debt at 'A+'; --Long-term deposits at 'AA-'. --Short-term deposits at 'F1+';  --Viability Rating at 'a+'; --Support at '5'; --Support Floor at 'NF'. American Express Bank, FSB --Long-term IDR at 'A+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Senior debt at 'A+'; --Long-term deposits at 'AA-'. --Short-term deposits at 'F1+'; --Viability Rating at 'a+'; --Support at '5'; --Support Floor at 'NF'.

American Express Canada Credit Corp. --Long-term IDR at 'A+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1';  --Senior debt at 'A+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

190,AXP,Alibaba to help Bigcommerce clients tap China supplier network,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alibaba Group Holding Ltd has forged a deal to allow online shopping startup Bigcommerce’s 70,000-plus clients to more easily buy from top-ranked Chinese suppliers and manufacturers on Alibaba.com. The tie-up helps round off Bigcommerce’s services, a startup which helps clients from Gibson Guitars to Ubisoft Entertainment SA create and market e-commerce websites. The Chinese company and Bigcommerce have created a software app to help Bigcommerce’s customers better navigate Alibaba.com, the companies said in a statement on Wednesday. Alibaba.com is the Chinese ecommerce giant’s original product, a service through which millions of merchants around the world source cheap parts, components and products from Chinese suppliers.  It caters primarily to smaller businesses looking for manufacturing partners in China and elsewhere but often lack the financial resources to secure reliable suppliers on their own. Clients of six-year-old Bigcommerce, which counts Softbank Capital, American Express Co and General Catalyst among its investors, will start out with access to 300 “gold suppliers” on Alibaba’s service.  That partnership may eventually extend to thousands more suppliers, and Bigcommerce’s customers will also have the option of selling their products to Alibaba.com users. “For many of our merchants, Alibaba.com represents a tremendous opportunity to tap into the world’s largest supplier network - whether to start selling or expand an existing business - without taking on unnecessary risk or sacrificing margins,” Bigcommerce co-founder and CEO Eddie Machaalani said in a statement.

191,AXP,"AmEx revenue misses on strong dollar, loss of co-branded tie-ups","(Reuters) - American Express Co, the world’s largest credit card issuer, reported quarterly revenue that fell short of analysts’ estimates, hurt by a stronger dollar and the loss of several co-branded tie-ups. AmEx’s shares fell 1.4 percent to $79.80 after the bell on Thursday. Revenue from international operations, net of interest expense, fell 8 percent to $1.24 billion in the quarter ended March 31, accounting for about 16 percent of AmEx’s total revenue. The dollar, which has gained about 22 percent in the past 12 months against a basket of major currencies, has been a spot of bother for U.S. multinational companies. Total revenue, net of interest expense, fell 2.7 percent to $7.95 billion. Analysts had estimated revenue of $8.20 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “AmEx investors generally view tougher revenue comps as more negative than they would for another company,” Janney Montgomery Scott LLC analyst Sameer Gokhale said. AmEx also said the termination of several co-branded relationships, including that with Costco Wholesale Corp in Canada last year, hurt revenue. “We are now seeing the full impact from the termination of this relationship,” a company executive said in a post-earnings conference call, referring to the Costco partnership. AmEx’s exclusive agreement with Costco in the United States, under which the retailer accepts only AmEx cards, is also set to end next March. The tie-up accounts for 8 percent of spending on AmEx cards. Stiff competition has made the “co-branded” credit cards business increasingly tough across the industry due to wafer-thin margins. Such cards make up about a third of AmEx’s purchase volume. AmEx, which also ended a co-branded deal with JetBlue Airways Corp in the first quarter, said in February the loss of the Costco contract in the United States would hurt earnings for the next two years. Sluggish revenue growth in recent years has forced the company to rein in costs. It plans to cut more than 4,000 jobs this year. AmEx, which raised interest rates for a large number of its credit cards for the first time in five years in February, also lost a case filed by the U.S. government and 17 states, which accused it of violating antitrust laws by prohibiting merchants from steering consumers to use cheaper credit cards.

195,AXP,American Express told it cannot enforce anti-steering rules against merchants,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Merchants unhappy with the fees American Express Co  charges them may steer customers toward less expensive cards without fearing retaliation from the credit card company, a federal judge ruled on Thursday. Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn federal court said American Express may not stop restaurants and stores, for instance, from offering discounts, rebates or other incentives for using lower-fee cards. Merchants may also tell customers about the relative costs of using particular cards, the judge ruled. Garaufis ruled in February that American Express’ rules for merchants against such activity, known as steering, “imposed actual, concrete harms on competition in the credit and charge card network services market.” The February decision and the injunction issued on Thursday represented victories for the U.S. government and 17 states. They sued American Express in 2010, alleging it broke antitrust law by forbidding merchants from urging consumers to use cards with lower “swipe fees.” These are charges that must be paid by a merchant for accepting a credit card payment. The U.S. Justice Department settled with Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc over the same practices in 2010. The department argued that the companies’ rules against allowing merchants to steer customers toward the cheaper cards were illegal under antitrust law. Card companies charge merchants more than $50 billion a year to process consumer transactions, the government said. Those fees have also spurred years of litigation by the merchants against the card companies. American Express did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case is U.S. v.

199,AXP,American Express told it cannot enforce anti-steering rules against merchants,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Merchants unhappy with the fees American Express Co  charges them may steer customers toward less expensive cards without fearing retaliation from the credit card company, a federal judge ruled on Thursday. Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn federal court said American Express may not stop restaurants and stores, for instance, from offering discounts, rebates or other incentives for using lower-fee cards. Merchants may also tell customers about the relative costs of using particular cards, the judge ruled. Garaufis ruled in February that American Express’ rules for merchants against such activity, known as steering, “imposed actual, concrete harms on competition in the credit and charge card network services market.” The February decision and the injunction issued on Thursday represented victories for the U.S. government and 17 states. They sued American Express in 2010, alleging it broke antitrust law by forbidding merchants from urging consumers to use cards with lower “swipe fees.” These are charges that must be paid by a merchant for accepting a credit card payment. The U.S. Justice Department settled with Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc over the same practices in 2010. The department argued that the companies’ rules against allowing merchants to steer customers toward the cheaper cards were illegal under antitrust law. Card companies charge merchants more than $50 billion a year to process consumer transactions, the government said. Those fees have also spurred years of litigation by the merchants against the card companies. “We are pleased that the court has ordered American Express to eliminate its illegal anti-steering rules,” the Justice Department said in a statement, adding that merchants and consumers would benefit. American Express did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case is U.S. v. American Express Co, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, No. 10-4496.

201,AXP,"UPDATE 1-Buffett's Berkshire adds to favorites IBM, Wells Fargo","(Adds details of holdings, comment, byline) By Jonathan Stempel May 15 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc  on Friday said it has boosted its holdings in some of the billionaire’s favorite companies, including Wells Fargo & Co  and International Business Machines Corp. The changes were disclosed in a regulatory filing detailing Berkshire’s U.S.-listed stock portfolio as of March 31. Berkshire also boosted its share stake in U.S. Bancorp , another large holding, while other portfolio managers adjusted their stakes in several companies. No new stocks were added to the portfolio, which shrank to $107.1 billion from $109.4 billion in December. Berkshire bought $1.62 billion and sold $1.11 billion of equities overall. Buffett has long praised his “Big Four” stock holdings Wells Fargo, IBM, Coca-Cola Co and American Express Co, which comprise roughly 58 percent of Berkshire’s equity investments. Buffett has stuck with them despite recent adversity including IBM’s stagnant stock price, concern over Coca-Cola’s sugary products and executive pay structure, and a February court ruling that American Express violated antitrust law. “Too many fund managers are more interested in seeing stocks to which they have committed perform well” in the short term, said Andy Kern, a University of Missouri professor who teaches a class on Buffett’s investment strategies. “Berkshire has such a long time horizon that it can afford to watch the stock price go down so it can buy more.” Friday’s regulatory filing does not disclose who makes which investment at Berkshire. Smaller investments are often made by portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who may succeed Buffett as chief investment officers after he departs. In the first quarter, Berkshire raised its stake in Wells Fargo by about 2 percent to 470.3 million shares, and in IBM by roughly 3 percent to 79.6 million shares. The U.S. Bancorp stake grew about 5 percent to 83.8 million shares. Other holdings that grew include Deere & Co, Liberty Global Plc, Phillips 66, Precision Castparts Corp and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. Holdings declined in Bank of New York Mellon Corp, Charter Communications Inc, National Oilwell Varco Inc , Viacom Inc and Wabco Holdings Inc. Berkshire also owns more than 80 businesses, including the Burlington Northern railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream and Geico car insurance. Buffett, 84, this month celebrated his 50th anniversary running his Omaha, Nebraska-based company, whose market value is fifth-highest among publicly-traded U.S. companies.

203,AXP,American Express loses emergency bid to block U.S. card injunction,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected American Express Co’s emergency request to halt an injunction that requires the company to let merchants steer customers toward lower-cost cards offered by competitors. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York nonetheless said it will hear American Express’ appeal in the underlying antitrust case on an expedited basis. American Express is appealing a Feb. 19 decision by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn, New York that its rules preventing merchants who accept its cards from recommending that customers pay with other cards, such as MasterCard and Visa, violate antitrust laws. The judge’s April 30 injunction against enforcing these rules also lets merchants offer discounts, rebates and other incentives to customers for using other cards with lower fees. Garaufis has said American Express’ practices wrongfully exploited the New York-based company’s 26.4 percent share of purchase volume in the U.S. credit and charge card market. “We are disappointed the request for a stay was denied,” American Express said in a statement on Tuesday. “We will move forward to modify the non-discrimination provisions in our merchant contracts, per the trial court’s remedy.” American Express has argued that enforcing the injunction would “weaken competition and harm consumers” in the $2.4 trillion U.S. credit card industry, and cause irreparable harm by costing it revenue and market share.

207,AXP,American Express sued for misleading investors about Costco,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American Express Co was accused in a lawsuit on Thursday of blindsiding investors with the loss of a crucial contract with Costco Wholesale Corp after having failed to reveal how significant that business had become. In a lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court, shareholder Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 137 Pension Fund sought class action status on behalf shareholders who suffered losses after the credit card company in February announced the end of its co-branding agreement with the warehouse club retailer. AmEx at the time said the loss of the contract, set to expire March 31, 2016, would hurt earnings for the next two years. Over the next two days, AmEx’s stock plummeted, losing $8 per share to close at $77.53, according to the lawsuit. The decline wiped out close to $9 billion of market value. Representatives for American Express did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Costco, which sells everything from jewelry to fresh produce at its cavernous members-only stores, had an exclusive co-branding arrangement with AmEx since 1999 for the store’s U.S. business. According to the lawsuit, AmEx did not disclose the revenues and loan volume generated through the agreement with Costco until February when the company announced it was ending its arrangement with the retailer. The lawsuit said that by 2014, the Costco business had in fact generated 8 percent of the company’s revenues and 20 percent of its outstanding loans. The lawsuit said that by October, unbeknownst to investors, AmEx and Costco had begun discussing renewing the U.S. agreement. AmEx subsequently on Feb. 12 announced the end of that business. The complaint said that by concealing the value of Costco’s relationship and its financial prospects, AmEx overstated the continuing revenue growth for its U.S. card services segment.

214,AXP,COLUMN-Judge finds lawyer 'fatally tainted' Amex deal: Frankel,"(The opinions expressed here are those of Alison Frankel, a columnist for Reuters.) (Reuters) - Gary Friedman of the Friedman Law Group can now put a price tag on the cost of his horribly misguided decision to share privileged and confidential documents from his antitrust class action against American Express with his old friend Keila Ravelo, a lawyer for MasterCard in a parallel case: $75 million. After a ruling Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis of Brooklyn, Friedman and his co-counsel in the Amex case are no longer in line for that $75 million. They were slated to receive the money for a settlement that permits merchants to impose a surcharge on customers who use Amex credit cards, as long as those retailers impose the same surcharge when consumers use other credit cards. The judge denied final approval of the settlement, finding that Friedman didn’t provide class members with adequate representation. Garaufis’ ruling adds devastating details to previously bare-bones allegations about the documents Friedman gave Ravelo. The misconduct first surfaced after federal prosecutors charged Ravelo with setting up a fake legal services company that she and her husband allegedly used to defraud MasterCard and two law firms where she had been a partner, Willkie Farr & Gallagher and Hunton & Williams. Willkie’s internal investigation of Ravelo turned up evidence that Friedman had been sending documents from the Amex case to her, even as she defended MasterCard in a separate class action raising similar swipe-fee antitrust allegations against Visa and MasterCard. Merchants that didn’t like the terms of the Amex settlement or the $5.7 billion settlement in the MasterCard case have argued that Friedman’s disclosures tainted both deals, even though MasterCard was not a defendant in the Amex case Friedman led and Friedman wasn’t lead counsel for the class suing Visa and MasterCard. Their briefs have been heavily redacted. Judge Garaufis’ opinion is not. His decision shows that Friedman gave Ravelo pretty much his entire case file: confidential Amex documents (at least 33), confidential documents from members of the class he was representing (22 of those), even his own work product, including strategy memos and emails amongst his co-counsel. Friedman’s lawyers, New York University law professor Samuel Issacharoff and Theresa Trzaskoma of Brune & Richard, have said he used Ravelo as an informal sounding board, to the benefit of the class. Judge Garaufis said instead that his disclosures to a lawyer for MasterCard called his loyalty to his clients into question. “Whether Friedman exchanged confidential and/or privileged materials with Ravelo and consulted with her regarding these actions for financial reasons, out of personal loyalty, due to a misplaced sense that her advice would in fact benefit the merchant class and was not improper, and/or for some other reason(s), is something this court cannot currently, and need not, determine,” he wrote. “Whatever his reason for doing so, Friedman’s bringing MasterCard’s counsel into the negotiating process created a conflict between class members and class counsel, and specifically a risk that Friedman, with Ravelo in his ear, negotiated settlement terms that are worse for class members than the terms he might have negotiated absent that conflict.” The judge said Friedman’s co-counsel, Reinhardt Wendorf & Blanchfield and Read McCaffrey, showed their own questionable judgment by sticking with Friedman in a brief attempting to rescue the settlement, rather than acknowledging his wrongdoing. “This gives the appearance that Friedman’s co-counsel may be more interested in protecting Friedman, their settlement, and their attorneys’ fees application, than they are in protecting the merchant class that they purport to represent,” the judge said. He removed Friedman as class counsel and ordered the other lead lawyers to submit briefs on why he shouldn’t bounce them as well. Garaufis’ opinion is full of surprising revelations, like Friedman and Ravelo’s plan to jointly represent merchants in arbitrations against American Express or to buy a Gulfstream jet and start an air charter business. Friedman, according to the judge, knew full well that it was wrong of him to share documents from the Amex case with Ravelo. He sent some sensitive messages to Ravelo’s personal email account, rather than her work addresses, “suggesting an intention to keep the communications from being discovered,” Judge Garaufis wrote. And in at least two emails to Ravelo, the judge said, Friedman wrote, “Burn after reading.” Breaching attorney client privilege might have been enough of an offense to justify a finding that Friedman did not adequately represent the merchants in the class, the judge said, “but this is not where the misconduct ends, and it does not constitute the complete story of the inadequacy of representation in this case.” That is where Judge Garaufis’ opinion gets really interesting. He discusses the intersection of the now-rejected Amex settlement with merchants’ $5.7 billion settlement with MasterCard and Visa, suggesting a motive for Friedman to push for a certain provision in the MasterCard deal. Retailers with objections to the MasterCard settlement have struggled to convince the magistrate judge in their case that Friedman’s improper disclosures should upend the final judgment entered against MasterCard and Visa. Garaufis’ opinion should help them hone their theory. According to the judge, the two settlements were inextricably connected, and Friedman - who assisted class counsel in the MasterCard case in negotiations on injunctive relief - had an incentive to argue for a provision in that settlement that would help him reach a deal with Amex. The judge quoted an email from November 2011 in which Friedman told Ravelo that Amex’s “fantasy resolution” of the swipe fee litigation was surcharge parity, in which merchants can tack on fees for Amex users as long as they charge the same fees when customers use Visa and MasterCard credit cards. The way to obtain that “fantasy,” Friedman said, was to include a provision in the merchants’ settlement with Visa and MasterCard to require a “level playing field” for such surcharges. Friedman was in constant touch with Ravelo during MasterCard’s settlement negotiations, according to Garaufis, providing her with the plaintiffs’ strategy memos and even volunteering to draft a paragraph on the level playing field provision for Ravelo to present to MasterCard. At the same time, the judge said, he passed to her information about Amex’s negotiating position and the class posture in that case. “This interaction between the (MasterCard) settlement and the (Amex) settlement agreement illustrates why Friedman’s apparent collaboration with Ravelo is so troubling,” Judge Garaufis said. “Friedman’s ability to be a zealous advocate for the class was compromised by his collaboration with counsel for MasterCard, an entity with interests divergent to those of the class; there is reason to be concerned that he was not acting solely in the class’s interests when he, teamed with Ravelo, engaged in settlement negotiations and decision-making.” The judge effectively outlines the interdependence of the two settlements. But the challenge for objectors in the MasterCard case will be to show Friedman or Ravelo had decision-making authority over that settlement. That won’t be easy. The class was represented by lead counsel from Robins Kaplan; Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd; and Berger & Montague, with Friedman just in a supporting role. MasterCard’s lead counsel was Ken Gallo of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison, not Keila Ravelo. And as settlement proponents in the MasterCard case have said repeatedly, their deal - including the level playing field provision - was proposed by an independent mediator in December 2011. Much of the correspondence between Friedman and Ravelo that Judge Garaufis cites came after the mediator had already suggested the provision. Overturning the MasterCard settlement is still a very long shot, but Judge Garaufis’ Amex ruling may improve the odds for settlement detractors. Objectors have submitted briefs calling for judgment in the case to be vacated to Visa, MasterCard and class counsel. Settlement proponents have until Aug. 18 to respond.

215,AXP,Activist hedge fund ValueAct takes stake in AmEx,"(Reuters) - Activist hedge fund ValueAct Capital Management LP has taken a stake in credit card issuer American Express Co (AXP.N), which is struggling with the loss of several co-branded tie-ups amid intense competition. The company's shares jumped as much as 7 percent to $80.14 in regular trading, after Bloomberg reported that ValueAct had built a $1 billion stake and was seeking ""shareholder-friendly"" changes. (bloom.bg/1MSB6w7) At that price, the company is valued at about $80 billion.  AmEx is not yet a core active target of ValueAct, Bloomberg said, citing people with knowledge of the matter.  However, the fund could sell its stake in AmEx if it decides against a longer-term campaign for change, Bloomberg said, adding that ValueAct had held preliminary talks with the company. “We have been speaking with them (ValueAct), as we do with other investors, and look forward to continuing a constructive dialogue,” AmEx spokeswoman Marina Norville said in an emailed statement.  ValueAct could not immediately be reached for comment. The hedge fund, which played a key role in shaking up Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) management, tends to make long-term investments.      AmEx, which caters mainly to wealthy corporate clients, has been cutting costs to cope with stiff competition that lost it a couple of lucrative co-brand contracts.

AmEx had then said that the loss would hurt earnings for the next two years. The company also ended a co-branded deal with JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O) in the first quarter. ValueAct’s stake would account for just over 1 percent of AmEx, based on Thursday’s close.

219,AXP,Consumers lose U.S. appeal over credit card arbitration clauses,"(Reuters) - The credit card industry won a big legal victory on Thursday as a federal appeals court rejected claims by a group of consumers that big issuers colluded to require that disputes be settled in arbitration rather than through class action lawsuits. By a 3-0 vote, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York upheld a lower court ruling that American Express Co , Citigroup Inc and Discover Financial Services  did not violate the Sherman antitrust law in forcing cardholders to submit to arbitration. Consumers argued that card-issuing banks and their lawyers broke the law when they held 28 meetings from May 1999 to October 2003 to discuss how to impose mandatory arbitration clauses in cardholder agreements. In April 2014, U.S. District Judge William Pauley ruled after a five-week bench trial that consumers failed by only a “slender reed” to show collusion, despite “conscious parallel action” among banks to require arbitration clauses. The appeals court said Pauley’s findings did not constitute “clear error,” and upheld them. “The district court found that the ‘final decision to adopt class-action-barring clauses was something the issuing banks hashed out individually and internally,’” the appeals court wrote. “That conclusion is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, and we cannot say that the district court was ‘clearly erroneous’ in reaching this conclusion.” Merrill Davidoff, a lawyer for the cardholders, said his clients disagree with the decision, and have not decided whether to appeal. Citigroup and American Express had no immediate comment. Discover did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Arbitration clauses have in recent years become more prevalent in consumer contracts, including for such things as cellphone, cable TV and Internet service. Companies often prefer them to class-action litigation, which lets consumers pool resources and potentially obtain greater recoveries. In contrast, many consumers may choose not to arbitrate because the chance of success is low, and the cost of pursuing individual claims can be prohibitive. Cardholders had sought to force American Express, Citigroup and Discover to remove arbitration clauses from their cardholder agreements for eight years.

222,AXP,American Express can enforce anti-steering rules: court,"(Reuters) - American Express Co (AXP.N) can once again enforce its rules prohibiting merchants from steering customers to other credit cards after an appeals court temporarily lifted an earlier court order on Friday. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is currently weighing American Express’ appeal of the earlier order, handed down by a lower court in April. It decided to lift the order until it decides the appeal. The 2nd Circuit’s ruling comes the day after it heard oral arguments in the case. American Express is appealing an April 30 order by Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn federal court. The order followed his finding in February that the credit card companies’ rules harmed competition and violated U.S. antitrust laws. The U.S. government and 17 states sued American Express in the Brooklyn court in 2010, alleging it broke antitrust law by forbidding merchants from steering consumers toward cards with lower “swipe fees.” These are charges that must be paid by a merchant for accepting a credit card payment. American Express’ rules forbid merchants from offering consumers discounts, rebates or other incentives for using lower-fee cards, or from telling consumers which cards they prefer. Friday’s ruling means the company can once again enforce those rules. The U.S. Justice Department settled with Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) over the same practices in 2010. Card companies charge merchants more than $50 billion a year to process consumer transactions, the government said in February. Those fees have also spurred years of litigation by the merchants against the card companies. American Express said in a statement that it was “encouraged” by the 2nd Circuit’s decision on Friday. “As we have consistently maintained, we do not believe the initial trial court’s ruling would provide any benefit to consumers and would harm competition by further entrenching the two dominant networks,” the company said.

232,AXP,AmEx shares fall as 2016 earnings outlook disappoints,"(Reuters) - Credit card issuer American Express Co’s (AXP.N) shares slumped in extended trading on Thursday after the company’s 2016 earnings forecast disappointed analysts and investors. AmEx shares fell about 3.7 percent to $60.35 in extended trading following the company’s 2016 earnings forecast of $5.40-$5.70 per share. Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research, said while the new guidance for 2016 is above consensus earnings estimates, it includes an expected $1 billion gain on the sale of Costco portfolio, which implies that underlying growth in 2016 will be “weaker than expected, not stronger.” Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Chenault did not specify he size of the expected gain from the Costco portfolio sale during the company’s earnings conference call.  Nomura Securities analyst Bill Carcache said some investors stripped about $0.66 a share off the expected earnings per share for the year to account for the gain. Analysts on an average estimate 2016 earnings of $5.41 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. AmEx lost long-term partners such as Fidelity Investments, retailer Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O) last year. The company also said it would cut $1 billion in costs by the end of 2017 as it responds to intensifying competition in the payments industry. “Our 2015 results and outlook reflect the reset in co-brand economics, pressures on merchant fees, the evolving regulatory environment and intense competition that have been re-shaping the payments industry,” Chenault said in a statement. Net income attributable to common shareholders fell to $873 million or 89 cents per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1.44 billion or $1.39 per share, a year earlier. The latest quarter included a $335 million after-tax charge and the year-earlier period a $453 million after-tax gain. AmEx reported its fourth straight decline in total revenue, net of interest expense, of $8.39 billion. Adjusted revenue rose 4 percent. Shares of the company, which had fallen about 10 percent this year to Thursday close, lost a quarter of their value in 2015.

233,AXP,American Express looks to grow small business loan revenue,"(Reuters) - American Express Co (AXP.N) wants to grow small-business lending to make up for revenue it expects to lose after its credit card partnership with Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) ends this year.    Last week, American Express said it will pay an undisclosed amount to feature its charge cards on Fundera, an online marketplace. AmEx hopes small-business owners will compare loan terms and rates and choose its cards over traditional loans.    The company is bracing for the end of co-branded cards with Costco that accounted for 8 percent of worldwide annual spending on AmEx cards in 2014, and 20 percent of the company’s outstanding loans.     The planned end of the partnership in March has been delayed a few months because it has taken more time to move customers to a new card, the Seattle Times reported last week.     To make up for that lost revenue, American Express has focused on small-business loans, where it already has a foothold. It views small-business cards as an area with room to grow in the near term, unlike consumer spending.  In 2014, American Express cards for small businesses funded $190 billion in purchases, up from $122 billion in 2010. The company considers cards an untapped form of small-business funding, because small businesses tend to rely more heavily on cash and traditional loans. Only 10 percent of small-business spending takes place on cards.      At AmEx’s investor day last year, management highlighted its small-business loan operation as an area of focus.    “One of the very most important things we’re doing as a company is lending and funding,” David Rabkin, AmEx’s senior vice president of small-business customer acquisition, said in an interview. “Putting our cards on Fundera marketplace is part of that.”    The charge cards American Express offers on Fundera, called Open, are designed for companies that need to fund large spot purchases of inventory or raw materials, and can pay off the balance in full each month. The Open cards do not charge interest, but carry an annual fee. Spending limits adjust with usage and payment history.     There may be pain ahead as American Express works to grow small-business lending.

234,AXP,American Express looks to grow small business loan revenue,"(Reuters) - American Express Co (AXP.N) wants to grow small-business lending to make up for revenue it expects to lose after its credit card partnership with Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) ends this year.    Last week, American Express said it will pay an undisclosed amount to feature its charge cards on Fundera, an online marketplace. AmEx hopes small-business owners will compare loan terms and rates and choose its cards over traditional loans.    The company is bracing for the end of co-branded cards with Costco that accounted for 8 percent of worldwide annual spending on AmEx cards in 2014, and 20 percent of the company’s outstanding loans.     The planned end of the partnership in March has been delayed a few months because it has taken more time to move customers to a new card, the Seattle Times reported last week.     To make up for that lost revenue, American Express has focused on small-business loans, where it already has a foothold. It views small-business cards as an area with room to grow in the near term, unlike consumer spending.  In 2014, American Express cards for small businesses funded $190 billion in purchases, up from $122 billion in 2010. The company considers cards an untapped form of small-business funding, because small businesses tend to rely more heavily on cash and traditional loans. Only 10 percent of small-business spending takes place on cards.      At AmEx’s investor day last year, management highlighted its small-business loan operation as an area of focus.    “One of the very most important things we’re doing as a company is lending and funding,” David Rabkin, AmEx’s senior vice president of small-business customer acquisition, said in an interview. “Putting our cards on Fundera marketplace is part of that.”    The charge cards American Express offers on Fundera, called Open, are designed for companies that need to fund large spot purchases of inventory or raw materials, and can pay off the balance in full each month. The Open cards do not charge interest, but carry an annual fee. Spending limits adjust with usage and payment history.     There may be pain ahead as American Express works to grow small-business lending. The credit-card business has gotten more competitive because banks and card issuers view the loans and transaction fees as a relatively stable source of revenue. Also, consumer spending has slowed despite cheaper gasoline.     American Express shares have fallen 25 percent so far this year. The company plans to cut $1 billion in costs by the end of 2017.

235,AXP,Buffett's Berkshire buys $1 bln worth of Phillips 66 stock in 2016,"(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) has bought an additional $1 billion of stock in Phillips 66 (PSX.N) this year, and now owns roughly 14.1 percent of the oil refiner. The conglomerate run by Warren Buffett has purchased about 12.98 million Phillips 66 shares this year, including nearly 2.18 million shares in February, according to regulatory filings through Tuesday night. Berkshire now owns 74.47 million Phillips 66 shares worth about $5.62 billion, based on Tuesday’s market close of $75.44. Berkshire has paid just over $77 per share for its added stake. Phillips 66 is Berkshire’s sixth-largest common stock holding, according to regulatory filings. The larger holdings are American Express Co (AXP.N), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), IBM Corp (IBM.N), Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the filings show. Berkshire also owns close to 90 businesses in industries including energy, food, insurance, manufacturing, railroads and retail. Last month, the Omaha, Nebraska-based company paid about $32 billion for industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp.

236,AXP,UPDATE 2-Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway quarterly profit jumps almost one third,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Saturday said fourth-quarter profit rose 32 percent, helped by improved results in its insurance operations and higher gains from investments and derivatives. Net income rose to $5.48 billion, or $3,333 per Class A share, from $4.16 billion, or $2,529 per share, a year earlier. Quarterly operating profit rose 18 percent to $4.67 billion, or $2,843 per share, from $3.96 billion, or $2,412 per share. Analysts on average had forecast operating profit of $2,814 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 7 percent to $51.82 billion. Book value per share, which reflects assets minus liabilities and which Buffett considers a good yardstick for Berkshire’s intrinsic worth, rose 3 percent from the end of September, to $155,501. For all of 2015, profit rose 21 percent to $24.08 billion, or $14,656 per share. The gain from the merger that created Kraft Heinz Co prevented profit from edging lower, Berkshire said. Operating profit rose 5 percent to $17.36 billion, or $10,564 per share. Buffett, 85, has run Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire for nearly 51 years. He has transformed it from a failing textile company into a conglomerate with roughly 90 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, energy, food, apparel and real estate. Buffett’s largest-ever acquisition, the $32 billion purchase of industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, closed last month. It ended the year with $71.73 billion of cash. Berkshire expects on Monday to close its acquisition of Procter & Gamble Co’s Duracell battery business, in exchange for P&G; shares that Berkshire now owns. Quarterly profit from insurance operations rose 25 percent to $1.34 billion, as improvement in reinsurance offset higher claims payouts in the Geico auto insurance unit.  Berkshire said gains from investments and derivatives quadrupled to $805 million. This in part reflected profits on stock sales and gains on long-term options contracts whose value is tied to the performance of the stock market. Profit at the BNSF railroad unit fell 9 percent to $1.08 billion, reflecting lower demand, especially in coal and some industrial products, as oil prices fell.  Buffett said BNSF’s profit could decline further in 2016. Berkshire’s insurance units ended 2015 with $87.7 billion of float, the amount of premiums held before claims are paid, Buffett said. Berkshire uses float to help fund acquisitions and other investments. The company has well over $100 billion of equity investments. Berkshire said it plans to keep its big stake in IBM Corp despite a $2.6 billion paper loss as of Dec. 31. In Friday trading, Berkshire’s Class A shares closed at $198,190.50, and its Class B shares closed at $131.92. Both are nearly unchanged this year.

241,AXP,UPDATE 1-Buffett boosts Berkshire's Wells Fargo stake to 10 pct,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Monday said it has increased its ownership stake in Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) to 10 percent, a level that could mean increased federal scrutiny over the investment. Berkshire owns 506.3 million shares of Wells Fargo, worth about $24.7 billion, mainly through subsidiaries, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The ownership stake has risen from 6.5 percent at the end of 2009 and 9.8 percent as of Dec. 31, according to Buffett. Berkshire has paid close to $13 billion for its Wells Fargo shares, based on Buffett’s shareholder letters and the bank’s recent stock price. Wells Fargo is based in San Francisco, and is the third-largest U.S. bank by assets. “We value Berkshire Hathaway as a long-term shareholder and customer and appreciate the confidence that Berkshire’s executive team has shown in Wells Fargo,” a spokesman said. The Federal Reserve exerts special oversight when investors take large stakes in banks. In a September 2008 policy statement, the Fed said it often lets investors take double-digit bank stakes not designed to exert a “controlling influence,” but would review any resulting business relationships “case-by-case.” The U.S. Treasury Department, meanwhile, has said it will not deem a 10 percent stake to result in “control” of a big bank if the investor agrees in writing to limits on its involvement. In one of Monday’s filings, Buffett certified that Berkshire’s Wells Fargo shares “were not acquired and are not held” with the intent of changing how the bank operates. Speaking on CNBC television on Feb. 29, Buffett called Wells Fargo “a terrific operation” and said Chief Executive John Stumpf has done a “fabulous job.” As of Dec. 31, Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire also owned a 15.6 percent stake in American Express Co (AXP.N), having crossed the 10 percent threshold two decades earlier. Berkshire also operates close to 90 businesses including the Geico insurer, the BNSF railroad, various utilities and Dairy Queen ice cream.

250,AXP,Costco posts flat comparable U.S. sales for first time in six years,"(Reuters) - Warehouse club retailer Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) on Wednesday reported no growth in quarterly comparable sales at U.S. stores for the first time in more than six years, hurt by weak sales in April. Sales at stores in the United States open more than a year were flat, falling short of the 1.9 percent growth expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix. Comparable sales at U.S stores had last fallen in 2009. Analysts earlier this month said a pullback in spending by high-income consumers, who make up Costco’s core customer base, contributed to lower comparable sales in April, when the company posted flat growth. Unseasonably cold weather in April, transition issues arising from the company switching to Visa Inc (V.N) for its co-branded credit cards from American Express Co (AXP.N) may have also weighed on comparable sales during the third quarter ended May 8. While retailers such as Macy’s Inc (M.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N) reported weak quarterly sales, citing unseasonable weather and lower demand for apparel and electronics, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), which largely caters to lower-income customers, reported better-than-expected sales, helped by demand for basic apparel and higher drug prices.  The quarterly results from retailers suggest that lower-income customers are spending while middle and higher-income customers are holding back.  Comparable store sales were flat in the third quarter, lower than the 1 percent rise analysts were expecting. Excluding the impact of fuel and currency fluctuations, sales at comparable stores rose 3 percent, below the average analyst estimate of 4.6 percent growth. Net income attributable to Costco rose to $545 million, or $1.24 per share, in the third quarter ended May 8 from $516 million, or $1.17 per share, a year earlier.

253,AXP,Samsung takes fight to Apple with mobile wallet strategy,"SYDNEY/SEOUL (Reuters) - Smartphone leader Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) has for years been a spectator as Apple (AAPL.O) built a services “ecosystem” supporting its products. But now, as the two develop the market for mobile payments, the Korean tech giant is taking the fight to its U.S. archrival. For Apple, offering users the ability to tap their iPhones on sales terminals to buy a coffee, snack or train ticket is a fresh revenue stream, like its iTunes music and entertainment service. The banks it works with cough up a small charge for each transaction - reportedly 0.15 percent in the United States. Samsung, which has trailed behind its competitors in software and services, is taking a different path. It is not seeking fees from its financial partners, viewing Samsung Pay as an engine to drive sales of phones and other devices. “We’re a hardware company, and at the end of the day I think what we’re trying to do is get people who hold (one of) our phones and use it ... to just love it more,” Elle Kim, Global Vice President of Samsung Pay, told Reuters in Sydney. It is early days yet; the companies’ payment services have been direct competitors in the United States only since last September, China for four months, and Australia and Singapore for just a week or two. Apple Pay is also available in Britain and Canada, and Samsung Pay in South Korea and Spain. Apple Pay usage totaled just $10.9 billion last year, mostly in the United States, tiny compared with China, where an estimated $1 trillion worth of mobile transactions were completed last year, dominated by Internet giants Alibaba (BABA.N) and Tencent (0700.HK). Alibaba and Tencent have ambitions to develop their business outside China, too, but have yet to make significant inroads. Samsung said on Tuesday its payments service had processed more than $1 billion in South Korea since its August launch – still only a fraction of the country’s $500 billion-plus credit card transactions last year. There is no reason why banks can’t work with both rivals, since these are not exclusive technologies, but Samsung’s approach could help it scale up quickly with banking partners. “Apple wants more control, and the negotiations are more complex,” said Christophe Uzureau, Vice President of Digital Payment Strategies at Gartner. “Samsung is more flexible, so from a bank’s perspective there is an ability to have more flexible terms and conditions.” The two have partnerships with a long list of banks and credit card companies in the United States and have many of the same partners in Singapore. Samsung Pay launched in Australia last Wednesday with partners American Express (AXP.N) and Citibank (C.N). Apple Pay has also teamed up with Amex there and with Australia and New Zealand Bank (ANZ)(ANZ.AX), so far the only major local bank to offer either service to its customers. Australia’s large banks all have their own mobile payment services, though National Australia Bank (NAB.AX) said it welcomed strategic partnerships in this space, and Westpac (WBC.AX) said it had discussions with a range of wallet providers and was assessing its options. Samsung Pay also has an extra technological weapon in its armory. Apple Pay only works with sales terminals equipped with Near Field Communications (NFC) technology, but phones compatible with Samsung Pay use both NFC and the older technology Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST), which mimics the magnetic strip on traditional payment cards. That gives Samsung an edge in countries like the United States, where NFC terminals are far from ubiquitous, said Thomas Ko, Vice President of Samsung’s Service R&D; Team, Mobile communications business. “Mobile payments need at the end of the day to make it available as much as where plastic is acceptable. If the mobile payments cannot match it, it’s very difficult for someone to replace their wallet with a mobile,” Ko said. Both Apple and Samsung, which sell 40 percent of global smartphones, are investing in mobile payment in part to defend their premium product pricing as the industry’s growth slows and Chinese rivals bring down average selling prices. Apple Pay is currently available on its late-model iPhones and the Apple Watch. Samsung Pay is available on its newer Galaxy mobile phones and some tablets. Samsung plans to offer the service on its virtual reality headset, and hopes that will enhance sales of the novel device. “Both companies will be looking to their payment solutions to drive loyalty,” said Foad Fadaghi, managing director of technology researcher Telsyte. Apple has been able to drive loyalty through its unique ecosystem and proprietary operating software, while Samsung, like many makers, runs its phones on Google’s (GOOG.O) Android software, making it more difficult to differentiate its offering. “It’s more important for Samsung to have services like Samsung Pay so that it can edge out its competitors which are numerous and many in the Android space, particularly the Chinese vendors,” Fodaghi said. Kim Ki-su, an IT industry worker in Seoul who uses Samsung Pay, has witnessed the marketing power of the service. “I know several people who were trying to decide between Galaxy S7 and LG’s G5, and they ultimately ended up with the S7 because of Samsung Pay,” he said.

264,AXP,Fitch Affirms American Express at 'A/F1'; Maintains Negative Outlook,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has today affirmed American Express  Company's (AXP) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A', Viability Rating  (VR) at 'a' and Short-Term IDR at 'F1'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.  A full  list of ratings is detailed at the end of this release. Today's rating actions have been taken as part of Fitch's periodic peer review  of U.S. consumer lending-focused internet banks, which comprises four publicly  rated firms.   KEY RATING DRIVERS  VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT The rating affirmations reflect AXP's strong franchise, spend-centric business  model, leading market position in the payments industry, peer-superior credit  performance, consistent profitability, diverse funding base, ample liquidity,  and strong risk-adjusted capitalization.  Rating constraints include meaningful erosion in AXP's earnings growth outlook,  a modestly weakened market position and greater earnings volatility stemming  from competitive and regulatory dynamics. Specifically, AXP faces challenges  stemming from the loss of several co-brand card partnerships, most notably the  termination of its co-brand relationship with Costco Wholesale Corporation  (Costco) in the second quarter of 2016 (2Q16), which had represented nearly 10%  of AXP's consolidated revenue. Additional rating constraints include AXP's  concentrated and cyclical business model, potential funding sensitivity  associated with wholesale and internet deposit funding sources, the likelihood  of asset quality reversion from current levels, and continued elevated  regulatory and legislative risk.  The maintenance of the Negative Rating Outlook reflects continued execution risk  as the company engages in strategic initiatives aimed at addressing the  challenges related to its profitability and business model. These initiatives  include a $1 billion cost reduction plan (run rate by the end of 2017),  acceleration of revolving loan growth by expanding its share of loans from its  existing Card Member base, achieving parity of merchant acceptance with Visa and  MasterCard in the U.S. by the end of 2019, and accelerating revenue growth  through increased penetration of the small business and middle market components  of its Global Commercial Services segment. At the same time, AXP is seeking to  respond to rapidly evolving technological developments in the payment space and  a period of, what Fitch views as, elevated management turnover.  Although competitive intensity in the credit card sector has manifested itself  most recently in the bidding process for co-brand partnerships, competition has  also intensified in rewards offerings to premium customers, particularly  cash-back products. Other payment networks have also become more aggressive in  offering lower interchange fees to merchants that produce significant volume,  and emerging payment technologies could further pressure merchant pricing. These  developments could drive more rapid erosion of AXP's discount rate and add  additional pressure to operating margins.  Additionally, the timing over which the company will be able to re-establish its  long-term financial targets is uncertain. Recent earnings guidance which  included an estimated $1 billion pre-tax gain from the expected sale of the  Costco card portfolio, and excluded any restructuring charges related to its  ongoing cost reduction initiatives implies that the company would be unable to  achieve its long-term EPS growth target of 12% - 15% until 2018 at the earliest.  Likewise, revenue growth has fallen short of the company's 8% long-term target  in recent years, which has created uncertainty as to whether such a level of  growth is reasonably attainable over the long term. In addition to the previously mentioned secular headwinds, Fitch believes  several cyclical headwinds could pressure AXP's revenue and EPS growth over the  near term. These include a stronger dollar, higher interest rates, credit  normalization, and weak global economic growth. Over the longer term, Fitch  believes AXP's operating performance should remain strong relative to peers,  supported by the company's largely fee-based business model and scale  advantages, the continued secular shift in global payments away from cash and  checks, a growing card member base, and continued expense discipline. Fitch also  expects the company to continue to seek to innovate and invest in new  opportunities that accelerate growth toward its longer-term financial targets. Credit performance is expected to remain among the strongest of large credit  card issuers, although charge-offs and delinquencies will likely start to  normalize later this year, particularly as balances from new accounts season.  Fitch expects provision expenses to increase over the next several quarters  driven primarily by portfolio seasoning and loan balance growth, as well as some  modest deterioration in credit metrics. Net charge-offs on the lending portfolio  increased 10 basis points (bps) to 1.5% in the first half of 2016 (1H16) but  remained well below other large credit card issuers and are near historical  lows. Reserve coverage remained strong at 1.8% of loans and 160% of loans past  due at June 30, 2016.  Unlike many of its peers, rising interest rates are an earnings headwind for  AXP, although Fitch believes the impact from rising interest rates is likely to  be manageable. At Dec. 31, 2015, assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase  in interest rates, AXP estimates that net interest income (NII) over the  following 12-month period would decrease by approximately $216 million. The  durability of AXP's internet deposits in a rising interest rate environment is  also unproven. The company's already strong regulatory capital ratios improved further from the  prior year end, driven in large part by the sale of the Costco portfolio in June  2016. The company's common equity Tier I ratio increased 110 bps to 13.5% at the  end of 2Q16. Additionally, AXP continued to perform well relative to peers in  the Federal Reserve's most recent Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review  (CCAR), albeit not quite to the degree of outperformance in prior year CCARs. As  part of this review, AXP received a non-objection related to its capital plan  submitted in April 2016, and announced a roughly 10% increase in its quarterly  common dividend and a share repurchase authorization of $3.3 billion over the  four quarters ended 2Q17.  Given a share repurchase program that is significantly below its previous $6.6  billion (over five quarters) authorization, Fitch expects AXP's payout ratio as  a percentage of earnings to moderate from the prior year's level when it  exceeded 100% of net income. Nonetheless, Fitch expects the company's regulatory  capital ratios to trend back toward 2015 levels over the next couple of years as  management emphasizes loan growth as part of its overall growth strategy.  AXP's liquidity profile remains a rating strength. AXP had approximately $34  billion of readily available cash and marketable securities at June 30, 2016, of  which a portion is used to fund daily operating activities. This compared to  $16.7 billion of long-term debt and certificate of deposit maturities over the  next 12 months. Of the $16.7 billion of debt and deposits maturing over the next  12 months, $10.4 billion consisted of unsecured debt maturities. The company is  also subject to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), a liquidity standard imposed  by bank regulators to measure liquidity under a stress scenario, which AXP  reported that it was in compliance with as of June 30, 2016.   The affirmation of AXP's Short-Term IDRs at 'F1' reflects the strongest  intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments and maintains the  correspondence between short-term and long-term IDRs, as the 'F1' short-term IDR  can correspond to both an 'a+' and an 'a' VR under Fitch's criteria. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES AXP's rating on the 3.625% subordinated notes due December 2024 is one notch  below the entity's VR of 'a' in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each  instrument's respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk profile.  The subordinated note rating includes one notch for loss severity given the  subordination of these securities in the capital structure, and zero notches for  non-performance given contractual limitations on interest payment deferrals and  no mandatory trigger events which could adversely impact performance. AXP's preferred stock ratings are rated five notches below AXP's VR of 'a' in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profile. The preferred stock  ratings include two notches for loss severity given these securities deep  subordination in the capital structure, and three notches for non-performance  given that the coupons of these securities are non-cumulative and fully  discretionary. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS AXP Centurion Bank's and AXP Bank, FSB's uninsured deposit ratings of 'A+/F1+'  are rated one notch higher than their respective IDR's because U.S. uninsured  deposits benefit from depositor preference in the U.S. Fitch believes depositor  preference in the U.S. gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in  the event of default. HOLDING COMPANY AXP's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its bank subsidiaries, reflecting  its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a  source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also equalized  reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and subsidiary  failure and default probabilities. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR AXP has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, AXP is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  sovereign support is unlikely. AXP's IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any  support. RATING SENSITIVITIES IVR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT  Negative rating action could be driven by an inability to execute on  management's growth initiatives and cost reduction plan, a material degradation  in credit performance beyond expected normalization, a sharper than expected  erosion in AXP's discount rate, the termination of additional co-brand card  relationships, and/or meaningfully weaker liquidity and capital levels. Negative  rating momentum could also be driven by additional regulatory and/or legal  challenges, technological developments in payments, and increased competitive  intensity that leads to significant erosion in AXP's market share and  competitive position. That said, potential further negative rating actions would be likely to be based  on how several of the aforementioned factors develop rather than a single  factor, and a resolution is more likely to occur toward the outer end of Fitch's  Outlook period given the deliberate pace at which several of these factors are  expected to evolve. The Rating Outlook could be revised to Stable if the company is able to  demonstrate resiliency in its competitive position and maintain operating  performance that is consistently above peers without meaningfully weakening its  credit profile and/or capitalization levels.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The subordinated debt rating is directly linked to AXP's VR and would move in  tandem with any changes in AXP's credit profile. The preferred stock ratings are directly linked to AXP's VR and would move in  tandem with any changes in AXP's credit profile. LONG-AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS AXP Centurion Bank and AXP Bank, FSB's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one  notch higher than each company's IDR and therefore are sensitive to any changes  in their respective IDR's. The deposit ratings are primarily sensitive to any  change in AXP's long- and short-term IDRs. HOLDING COMPANY Should AXP's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential Fitch could notch the holding  company IDR and VR below the ratings of the operating companies. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since AXP's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.

268,AXP,U.S. loses bid to overturn AmEx antitrust decision,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday rejected the U.S. government’s request that it reconsider its decision allowing American Express Co (AXP.N) to stop merchants from encouraging customers to use rival cards that charge lower fees. Without comment, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals let stand its Sept. 26 reversal of a lower court ruling that had struck down AmEx’s “anti-steering” rules. That reversal by a three-judge panel allowed New York-based AmEx to block merchants that accept its cards from steering customers to rivals Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N), even if the move saved them money. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment. The government can still ask the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the case. Seventeen U.S. states also opposed AmEx’s anti-steering rules. At issue were the more than $50 billion of fees that merchants pay annually to process transactions, and which can be passed along to customers through higher prices. The Justice Department said the appeals court wrongly focused on how the company’s policy affected customers and merchants, rather than merchants alone. It also said it should have been AmEx’s burden to show that its policy promoted competition, not the government’s burden to show otherwise. Several dozen merchants including Kroger Co (KR.N), Target Corp (TGT.N) and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) supported a rehearing by the original panel, or by all of the appeals court’s active judges. Visa and MasterCard settled similar lawsuits in 2011 by agreeing to change their rules. AmEx accounted for 26.4 percent of U.S. credit and charge card purchase volume in 2013. It was able to resume enforcing its anti-steering rules after the 2nd Circuit in December 2015 lifted an injunction imposed by the lower court judge. AmEx spokesman Andrew Johnson said the government’s claims still lack merit. “With today’s decision, consumers can continue to choose how they pay and our card members will not be discriminated against at the point of sale,” he said. The case is U.S. et al v. American Express Co et al, 2ndU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-1672.

273,AXP,'More mellow' on Trump; not 'crazy' on Apple -Berkshire's Munger," LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Charlie Munger, the billionaire vice chairman of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), said some of U.S. President Donald Trump’s ideas may prove constructive for the country, tempering comments a year ago suggesting that his fellow Republican was not morally qualified for the White House.  “Well, I’ve gotten more mellow,” Munger said during Wednesday’s annual meeting at the publishing company Daily Journal Corp in Los Angeles, which he chairs.  MORE TOP NEWS Trump administration proposes stricter Obamacare rules Andrew Puzder out as Trump's Labor nominee Lawmakers push for answers on Trump team's Russia ties “He’s not wrong on everything,” said Munger, referring to Trump. “Just roll with it. If there’s a little danger, what the hell, you’re not going to live forever anyway.”  Munger, 93, spoke for nearly two hours to investors and students on a wide range of issues.  He has been Buffett’s right-hand man for decades, helping the 86-year-old build Berkshire into a roughly $410 billion conglomerate with more than 90 companies including insurers, utilities, food producers and a railroad.  Berkshire also has large investments in dozens of stocks, including iPhone maker Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and the four biggest U.S. carriers: American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N).  On Tuesday, Berkshire revealed multi-billion-dollar stakes in all five companies, marking a reversal of its longstanding aversion to the technology sector and antipathy to the “joke” that Munger said airlines once were.  Berkshire is now Apple’s fifth-largest investor, and the largest or second largest investor in the four airlines.  “The nice thing about the game we’re in is that we can keep learning,” Munger said.  “He’s changed when he’s buying airlines, and he’s changed when he’s buying Apple,” he said of Buffett.  “I don’t think we’ve gone crazy,” Munger added. “I think we’re adapting.”  Munger downplayed the impact of the recent scandal afflicting Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), in which Berkshire is the largest investor with a roughly 10 percent stake.  Wells Fargo was caught flat-footed by the public outcry after it settled regulatory charges that workers created as many as 2 million sham customer accounts to meet sales goals. The scandal cost longtime Chief Executive John Stumpf his job.  Munger said the bigger problem for Wells Fargo was not its sales culture, but how it reacted.  “The mistake there was that when the bad news came, they didn’t recognize it,” Munger said. “I don’t think that impairs the future of Wells Fargo.”  He was less definitive about the outlook of another big Berkshire holding, American Express Co (AXP.N), saying people would be in a “state of delusion” for thinking they could project the state of the payments system in a decade.  Munger also defended his earlier faulting of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc’s (VRX.TO) business practices, including the Canadian drug company’s model of acquiring rights to drugs and driving prices higher.  Criticism and regulatory probes have caused Valeant’s growth plan to unravel, and its share price to plunge more than 93 percent in a year-and-a-half.  “It was really interesting how many high-grade people that took in,” Munger said. “It was too good to be true.”  ",2152017,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-hatha-munger/more-mellow-on-trump-not-crazy-on-apple-berkshires-munger-idUSL1N1G01V4

279,AXP,UPDATE 2-AmEx profit beats as higher spending blunts partnership losses,"(Reuters) - American Express Co’s (AXP.N) first-quarter profit fell less than expected as its card members spent more and the company expressed more confidence over its full-year results, amid fierce competition in the industry. AmEx’s shares rose 2.5 percent after the bell on Wednesday as the results and guidance indicated the company was starting to mitigate some of the impact of losing key partnerships last year, especially one with Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O). Some of that impact was also blunted by AmEx spending heavily on marketing as well as on premium rewards to retain existing customers and woo new ones. The company, which has long catered to affluent customers, last month fattened up rewards on its Platinum charge cards to fortify its high-end market against JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N). However, AmEx is curbing costs in other areas to bolster margins and said it was on track to remove $1 billion from its expenses this year and was “very confident” of meeting its full-year profit forecast of $5.60-$5.80 per share. “As we move through 2017, we expect net income and EPS to grow due to the benefits from our cost-reduction initiatives and the seasonality of revenue,” Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Campbell said on a call with analysts. Campbell has said in mid-January, after AmEx’s fourth-quarter results, that earnings and revenue would be “uneven” in 2017. AmEx said first-quarter net income attributable to shareholders fell 13 percent to $1.21 billion, or $1.34 per share, from a year earlier, which included some now  discontinued partnerships. Analysts on average were expecting $1.28 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. KBW analyst Sanjay Sakhrani said AmEx did reasonably well, excluding Costco, and noted the company’s growth had accelerated last year and continued in the latest quarter. “The company has had to spend more to generate the types of growth ... and now we see them starting to pull back on the expenses, but still put up accelerated growth and I think that is what is encouraging,” Sakhrani said. AmEx said it also benefited from higher net card fees and loan growth in the quarter. Card member spending increased 8 percent, adjusted for currency fluctuations and the loss of the Costco partnership, while net card fees rose 7 percent. Loans grew 11 percent, with more than half of the growth in U.S. consumer loans coming from existing customers. AmEx added 1.7 million new cards across its U.S. issuing businesses and 2.6 million worldwide in the quarter, slightly higher than the additions in the fourth quarter.

282,AXP,Buffett says deal partner 3G follows 'standard capitalist formula'-CNBC,"May 8 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett said on Monday 3G Capital, its controversial partner on multiple transactions, follows a “standard capitalist formula” when it sweeps away thousands of jobs and imposes deep expense cuts to make the companies it buys more efficient. Speaking on CNBC television, Buffett said, “It’s a defect of mine” that he doesn’t focus as closely on the efficiency of business units at Berkshire Hathaway Inc, the conglomerate he has run since 1965. Berkshire and 3G control Kraft Heinz Co and recently tried to merge it with Unilever NV UNc.AS> for $143 billion, but was rebuffed. The Brazilian firm is known for “zero-based budgeting,” where it requires managers to periodically defend all of their expenses, and cuts waste where possible. “They have followed the standard capitalist formula ... of trying to do the same business with fewer people,” Buffett said. “People live better when there is more output per capita.” Nonetheless, he acknowledged that cutting jobs can be a “painful process.” Separately, Buffett expressed regret over his failure to invest early in Internet search company Google, now part of Alphabet Inc, saying “I should have some insight into” what became an “extraordinary business” with attributes of a monopoly. He said he was more comfortable buying shares of Apple Inc , in which Berkshire has disclosed a 133 million share stake, worth close to $20 billion on Friday. Buffett noted that many iPhone purchasers are repeat customers who know a new phone will be introduced regularly, or buy them for such occasions as graduations. “I can very easily determine the competitive position of Apple now and who is trying to chase them,” he said. He said “the shares, when we bought them, were much more reasonable” in price. Asked if he had stopped buying Apple, Buffett said: “Maybe, may not.” Buffett said he was not bothered by initial U.S. data showing the economy grew at just 0.7 percent in the first quarter, saying it was “more or less” growing at 2 percent a year. He said some of Berkshire’s industrial units saw upticks in business this year, as have credit card companies such as Visa Inc and American Express Co, a longtime Berkshire investment. “Credit cards will tell you a lot about the consumer, what their attitude is,” he said.

289,AXP,AmEx profit dips as it splurges on customer rewards,"(Reuters) - American Express Co’s profit declined 33 percent in the second quarter, hurt partly by higher expenses, as the card company spent heavily on rewards to woo customers amid intense competition from big U.S. banks. Shares of the company, up 16 percent so far this year, dipped 1.2 percent to $84.87 in after-market trading. New York-based AmEx has increased spending on rewards to prevent its generally affluent clientele from switching to JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc, which have rolled out lucrative rewards in an effort to boost their own credit card businesses. For JPMorgan and Citi, post-financial crisis regulations have made the credit card business more profitable than businesses such as mortgages and capital markets trading. Both the major banks reported upbeat results at their card businesses in their earnings last week. AmEx said it spent $1.93 billion on card member rewards in the second quarter ended June 30, up 9 percent from a year earlier. That increase was the highest since late 2014. As a result, total expenses soared 21 percent to $5.77 billion, denting profit, which declined but beat analysts’ forecasts. Net income attributable to shareholders plunged 33 percent to $1.31 billion, or $1.47 per share, partly reflecting the loss of a longtime partnership with warehouse club retailer Costco Wholesale Corp as well as a $1 billion gain in the year-ago quarter on the sale of a related loan portfolio. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.43 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue, net of interest expense, inched up 0.8 percent to $8.31 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $8.20 billion. The better-than-expected results came as adjusted card member spending rose 8 percent and AmEx added 2.7 million proprietary card members globally. “The work is not complete, but we’re now moving forward with a stronger foundation,” Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault said in a statement. Discount revenue, which makes up the bulk of AmEx’s total revenue and represents fees paid by merchants to the company, was flat at $4.82 billion. AmEx also backed its forecast for full-year earnings of $5.60 to $5.80 per share and said it was on track to remove $1 billion from its expenses this year. The company’s shares slipped in after-hours trading as investors were probably disappointed that AmEx did not lift its earnings forecast after reporting a better-than-expected profit, KBW Inc analyst Sanjay Sakhrani said.

297,AXP,American Express to pay $96 million over discriminatory card terms,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American Express (AXP.N) will end up paying $96 million to credit card customers in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories for charging higher interest rates and engaging in other discriminatory practices, federal regulators said on Wednesday.  The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that more than 200,000 consumers at two of the company’s banking subsidiaries had been harmed by the practices, which also included stricter credit cutoffs and less debt forgiveness than offered to customers in U.S. states. American Express said in a statement the discrepancy was discovered in an internal review and reported to the CFPB in 2013. The company voluntarily agreed to provide $95 million in compensation to affected customers, but said it “absolutely does not” agree with the CFPB’s contention that it had discriminated against clients. “Having long since taken actions that the CFPB subsequently ratified, the company decided to settle with them rather than go through years of litigation that would have provided no additional value to any of its customers,” American Express said. The CFPB ordered the company to pay an additional $1 million on top of the $95 million and establish new guidelines to ensure the terms of its card offerings were not discriminatory in the future. The agency added that the company had not intentionally discriminated against customers, but rather the discrepancy occurred due to different business units overseeing cards in U.S. territories as opposed to U.S. states. “They have ceased this practice and are making consumers whole. In particular, because they self-reported the problem and fully cooperated with our investigation, no civil penalties are being assessed in this matter,” CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in the statement.

300,AXP,Fitch Affirms American Express at 'A/F1'; Outlook Revised to Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 08 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed American Express Company's (AXP) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A', Viability Rating (VR) at 'a' and Short-Term IDR at 'F1'. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Stable from Negative. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. Today's rating actions have been taken as part of Fitch's periodic peer review of U.S. consumer lending-focused internet banks, which comprises four publicly rated firms. KEY RATING DRIVERS VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT The rating affirmations reflect AXP's strong franchise, spend-centric business model, leading market position in the payments industry, peer-superior credit performance, consistent profitability, diverse funding base, ample liquidity, and strong risk-adjusted capitalization. The revision of AXP's Outlook to Stable from Negative reflects the stabilization of its key operating performance metrics over the past year, specifically the resumption of billed business and revenue growth (adjusted for Costco) to levels more in line with those achieved prior to the termination of the Costco relationship. In addition, the company continues to make progress on other strategic initiatives that management outlined in 1Q16, which included reducing its operating expenses by $1 billion, increasing its penetration of existing cardholders' revolving balances, accelerating growth of its middle market and small business customer franchises, and improving merchant acceptance of its card products in the U.S. Fitch views the more stable trends as sustainable over the Outlook horizon. Rating constraints include AXP's concentrated and cyclical business model, potential funding sensitivity associated with wholesale and internet deposit funding sources, the likelihood of asset quality reversion from current levels, and continued elevated regulatory and legislative risk. Although competitive intensity in the credit card sector has manifested itself most prominently in the bidding process for co-brand partnerships, competition in rewards offerings to premium customers more broadly remains intense. Other payment networks have also become more aggressive in offering lower interchange fees to merchants that produce significant volume, and emerging payment technologies could further pressure merchant pricing. Although these developments could drive more rapid erosion of AXP's discount rate and apply further pressure to operating margins, the company has demonstrated an ability to leverage the flexibility of its closed loop business model in navigating similar challenges during previous market cycles. In addition to the previously mentioned secular headwinds, Fitch believes several cyclical headwinds could continue to pressure AXP's revenue and EPS growth over the near term. These include a FX volatility, higher interest rates, credit normalization, and weak global economic growth. Over the longer term, Fitch believes AXP's operating performance should remain strong relative to peers, supported by the company's largely fee-based business model and scale advantages, the continued secular shift in global payments away from cash and checks, a growing card member base, and continued expense discipline. Nonetheless, Fitch believes both cyclical and secular challenges may result in greater earnings volatility over the medium term than AXP has experienced in the past, particularly should lending become a larger driver of the company's revenue. Credit performance is expected to remain among the strongest of large credit card issuers, although charge-offs and delinquencies have begun to trend higher as balances from new accounts season. Fitch expects the growth in provision expense to continue to outpace loan growth over the next several quarters driven primarily by portfolio seasoning, as well as some modest deterioration in credit metrics. Net charge-offs on the lending portfolio increased 30 basis points (bps) to 1.8% in 2Q17 compared to 1.5% in 2Q16 but are well below other large credit card issuers and remain near historical lows. As a result of the increases in loss provision, reserve coverage increased to 2% of loans and 167% of loans past due at June 30, 2017, compared to 1.8% and 160%, respectively, a year ago. Although down from last year's level, AXP's regulatory capital ratios remain a rating strength. The company's common equity Tier I ratio (CET1) dipped 120 bps to 12.3% at the end of 2Q17 compared to the year ago quarter. While Fitch expects AXP's CET1 to continue to decline over time toward its 10% longer-term target, its payout ratio as a percentage of earnings should also moderate to reflect the increase in capital needed to support strong loan growth. AXP's liquidity profile is also a rating strength. The company had approximately $30 billion of readily available cash and marketable securities at June 30, 2017, of which a portion is used to fund daily operating activities. This compared to $11.8 billion of long-term debt and certificate of deposit maturities over the next 12 months. Of the $11.8 billion of debt and deposits maturing over the next 12 months, $8.6 billion consisted of unsecured debt maturities. The affirmation of AXP's Short-Term IDRs at 'F1' reflects the strongest intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments and maintains the correspondence between short-term and long-term IDRs, as the 'F1' short-term IDR can correspond to both an 'a+' and an 'a' VR under Fitch's criteria. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES AXP's rating on the 3.625% subordinated notes due December 2024 is one notch below the entity's VR of 'a' in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk profile. The subordinated note rating includes one notch for loss severity given the subordination of these securities in the capital structure, and zero notches for non-performance given contractual limitations on interest payment deferrals and no mandatory trigger events which could adversely impact performance. AXP's preferred stock ratings are rated five notches below its VR of 'a' in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk profile. The preferred stock ratings include two notches for loss severity given these securities' deep subordination in the capital structure and three notches for non-performance given that the coupons of these securities are non-cumulative and fully discretionary. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS AXP Centurion Bank's and AXP Bank, FSB's uninsured deposit ratings of 'A+/F1+' are rated one notch higher than their respective IDR's because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from depositor preference in the U.S. Fitch believes depositor preference in the U.S. gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default. HOLDING COMPANY AXP's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its bank subsidiaries, reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and subsidiary failure and default probabilities. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR AXP has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's view, AXP is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of sovereign support is unlikely. AXP's IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support. RATING SENSITIVITIES IVR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT Negative rating momentum could be driven by an inability to sustain the recent stabilization in AXP's core operating trends for an extended period, a material degradation in credit performance relative to peers, a sharper than expected erosion in AXP's discount rate, and/or meaningfully weaker liquidity and capital levels. Negative rating momentum could also be driven by additional regulatory and/or legal challenges, technological developments in payments, and continued competitive intensity that leads to significant erosion in AXP's market share and competitive position. Fitch believes positive rating momentum is relatively limited in the near term, given the heightened competitive environment, AXP's concentrated exposure credit/charge cards, and its high reliance on wholesale funding. Longer-term positive rating momentum could potentially be driven by successful navigation of current regulatory, partnership and competitive/technological challenges, increased earnings diversification that results in less cyclical financial performance, and enhanced funding diversity/stability, particularly with respect to internet-based deposits. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The subordinated debt rating is directly linked to AXP's VR and would move in tandem with any changes in AXP's credit profile. The preferred stock ratings are directly linked to AXP's VR and would move in tandem with any changes in AXP's credit profile. LONG-AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS AXP Centurion Bank and AXP Bank, FSB's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than each company's IDR and therefore are sensitive to any changes in their respective IDR's. The deposit ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in AXP's long- and short-term IDRs. HOLDING COMPANY Should AXP's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to meet near-term obligations, Fitch could notch the holding company IDR and VR below the ratings of the operating companies. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since AXP's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively, there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable future.

304,AXP,American Express wins dismissal of lawsuit over lost Costco contract,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American Express Co (AXP.N) has won the dismissal of a lawsuit accusing the credit card services company of defrauding shareholders about the loss in 2015 of a lucrative co-branding relationship with Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O). In a decision made public on Monday, U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan rejected claims that American Express improperly downplayed the risk its 16-year relationship with Costco might end, and concealed how the warehouse chain had generated 8 percent of its revenue and 20 percent of its loans. While the proposed class-action complaint alleged that Costco might have viewed American Express as “just another vendor” that could be shunted aside for a “cheaper” rival, the judge said American Express merely viewed such statements as evidence that Costco would “drive a hard bargain,” not walk away. The plaintiffs were led by the Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 137 Pension Fund in Springfield, Illinois. Its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. American Express spokeswoman Marina Norville said the New York-based company was pleased with the decision, which was dated Sept. 30. The judge said the plaintiffs may amend their complaint. The market value of American Express fell by roughly $8 billion in the two days after the company, whose largest shareholder is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), disclosed the loss of the Costco contract, which moved to Visa Inc (V.N). American Express has long traditionally focused on affluent customers who often pay bills on time, but has been encouraging some cardholders to borrow more and earn more rewards. This summer, American Express announced a plan to let cardholders pay off purchases of $100 or more in installments, which could result in more fees.

307,AXP,Buffett says success of Trump tax plan may affect stock investments,"Oct 3 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett is closely monitoring whether U.S. President Donald Trump can lower corporate taxes, one of the rare times the billionaire has looked to Washington to help him decide which stocks to buy and sell. “It’s an actual factor at Berkshire,” Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, said in a Tuesday interview with CNBC television. “And it’s very, very, very seldom in my 87 years that it has ever been a factor.” Buffett normally buys stocks for the long term with less focus on tax issues. But when asked if he was thinking about taxes, he said “I think about them plenty” now. “We’ve got actions on both sides that we would take,” referring to taking gains or realizing losses, he said. Berkshire has said it ended June with more than $135 billion of equity investments, which Buffett mainly controls and holds for the long term. The conglomerate is sitting on huge gains in big investments such as American Express Co, Coca-Cola Co and Wells Fargo & Co, while other bets such as International Business Machines Corp have fared less well. Buffett had said at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, on May 6 that he would rather realize losses than take gains if he expected rates to fall. That might be a good strategy now, if Trump and many congressional Republicans succeeded in lowering the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. Buffett explained that he would “feel kind of silly” realizing a $1 billion gain and paying $350 million in taxes, only to have Congress lower the rate and thus his tax bill. He said other investors sitting on “hundreds of billions” of dollars of potential profits might be thinking the same thing. It is unclear whether the Republican-controlled Congress can pass a tax bill that Trump will sign, and Buffett said it has been unable to overhaul the Affordable Care Act or move forward on infrastructure, two of the president’s priorities. He expects to know by year end whether taxes are going down. “I would think the Republicans controlling both houses [of Congress] and the presidency, they would not want to have a shutout, in their first year,” Buffett said. “I think they can get it done.” (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Tom Brown)",10032017,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-hatha-trump-taxation/buffett-says-success-of-trump-tax-plan-may-affect-stock-investments-idUSL2N1ME191
308,AXP,"UPDATE 1-JPMorgan's card gamble lures millennial travelers, squeezes competitors","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morrie Low, a 28-year-old who works for a mobile technology start-up in Seattle, called from vacation in Taiwan to chat about what he has been doing the past year with his Chase Sapphire Reserve card. Sapphire Reserve is the credit card that shocked the industry when JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) debuted it in August 2016. Upwards of 1 million people signed up as users wrote in   internet posts that its perks, credits and give-backs were so rich people could recoup the $450 annual fee and pick up another $1,000 or so of value.  “It is definitely working out for me,” said Low, recounting trips he made using Sapphire Reserve and other card travel rewards to Miami, Berlin, London, the Philippines and Taiwan. It has not worked out so well for JPMorgan’s card competitors. And it is not clear when, or if, it will work out for JPMorgan, analysts and bank executives said. Entering the premium card market with the Sapphire Reserve, JPMorgan dramatically undercut the pricing of the Platinum Card of American Express Co (AXP.N) and the Prestige Card of Citigroup Inc. (C.N)  It also lured credit card spending from customers of Bank of America Corp (BAC.N). An American Express executive earlier this year called the move a “full frontal assault” on the Platinum Card. On Thursday, a Citigroup executive said that after JPMorgan’s move Citi changed course and turned its marketing toward no-fee cards that offer free borrowing for as long 21 months instead of travel rewards. “We shifted our focus away from rewards because of the competitive heat,” Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said in a conference call with reporters on Thursday after the bank posted quarterly results. Bank of America introduced a new rewards card in September but was “very careful to balance the customer value with the shareholder value,” Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio told analysts on Friday after the bank reported results. Investors are concerned that card issuers are stretching too far as they compete for business, whether through extra givebacks to customers or by granting more credit to riskier borrowers. On Thursday, disclosures by JPMorgan and Citigroup that they had increased provisions for credit losses hurt their shares even though the two reported profits that beat expectations.      JPMorgan’s invasion of the premium card business illustrates how Chief Executive Jamie Dimon is leveraging the scale and strength of his bank, the biggest in the United States, to undercut profit margins of competitors and take away business, analysts said. “This is another example of Dimon’s scorched earth strategy,” said one analyst, who declined to be named talking so bluntly about the bank’s tactics. JPMorgan has also muscled in since the financial crisis on European debt, fixed income trading, securities custody for institutional investors and commercial lending. Earlier this year Dimon quoted Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com as saying “your margin is my opportunity,” noted analyst Jason Goldberg of Barclays. “JPMorgan is trying to bring some of that to the financial space,” Goldberg said. The company has not given an exact cost for the Sapphire Reserve foray. It has said it must account for the expense of signing customers in the first year and that those costs have run as much as $200 million each quarter. That $800 million a year is a lot of money for most companies, but less so for JPMorgan, which this year is expected to earn about $25 billion, one analyst said. The move on premium cards is also an example of how Dimon’s lieutenants throughout the bank look for thin spots in their market penetration. When JPMorgan brought out Sapphire Reserve, its no-fee, low-fee and cash-back cards had already made it a strong second to American Express in card spending, according to the Nilson Report.  But it needed a premium travel card of its own for its customers, Jennifer Piespzak, chief executive for Chase Card Services, said in an interview. “For us to be able to earn the greatest share of the customer wallet, we don’t want them to have American Express Platinum,” she said. “We want them to have Sapphire Reserve.” JPMorgan earlier this year cut its sign-up bonus for Sapphire Reserve in half, saying the initial offer was to attract a base of users.

309,AXP,"JPMorgan's card gamble lures millennial travelers, squeezes competitors","NEW YORK, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Morrie Low, a 28-year-old who works for a mobile technology start-up in Seattle, called from vacation in Taiwan to chat about what he has been doing the past year with his Chase Sapphire Reserve card. Sapphire Reserve is the credit card that shocked the industry when JPMorgan Chase & Co debuted it in August 2016. Upwards of 1 million people signed up as users wrote in Internet posts that its perks, credits and give-backs were so rich people could recoup the $450 annual fee and pickup another $1,000 or so of value. “It is definitely working out for me,” said Low, recounting trips he made using Sapphire Reserve and other card travel rewards to Miami, Berlin, London, the Philippines and Taiwan. It hasn’t worked out so well for JPMorgan’s card competitors. And it is not clear when, or if, it will work out for JPMorgan, analysts and bank executives said. Entering the premium card market with the Sapphire Reserve bid, JPMorgan dramatically undercut the pricing of the Platinum Card of American Express Co and the Prestige Card of Citigroup Inc.  It also lured credit card spending from customers of Bank of America Corp. An American Express executive earlier this year called the move a “full frontal assault” on the Platinum Card. On Thursday, a Citigroup executive said that after JPMorgan’s move Citi changed course and turned its marketing toward no-fee cards that offer free borrowing for as long 21 months instead of travel rewards. “We shifted our focus away from rewards because of the competitive heat,” Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said in a conference call with reporters after posting quarterly results. JPMorgan’s invasion of the premium card business illustrates how Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon is leveraging the scale and strength of the biggest bank in the United States to undercut profit margins of competitors and take business, analysts said. “This is another example of Dimon’s scorched earth strategy,” said one analyst who declined to be named talking so bluntly about the bank’s tactics. JPMorgan has also muscled in since the financial crisis on European debt, fixed income trading, securities custody for institutional investors and commercial lending. Earlier this year Dimon quoted Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com as saying “your margin is my opportunity,” noted analyst Jason Goldberg of Barclays. “JPMorgan is trying to bring some of that to the financial space,” Goldberg said. The company has not given an exact cost for the Sapphire Reserve foray. It has said it must account for the expense of signing customers in the first year and that those costs have run as much as $200 million each quarter. That $800 million a year is a lot of money for most companies, but not such much for JPMorgan, which this year is expected to earn about $25 billion, one analyst said. The move on premium cards is also an example of how Dimon’s lieutenants throughout the bank look for thin spots in their market penetration. When JPMorgan brought out Sapphire Reserve, its no-fee, low-fee and cash-back cards had already made it a strong second to American Express in card spending, according to the Nilson Report. But it needed a premium travel card of its own for its customers, Jennifer Piespzak, chief executive for Chase Card Services, said in an interview. “For us to be able to earn the greatest share of the customer wallet, we don’t want them to have American Express Platinum,” she said. “We want them to have Sapphire Reserve.” JPMorgan earlier this year cut its sign-up bonus for Sapphire Reserve in half, saying the initial offer was to attract a base of users. Now the bank is trying to hold and consolidate the territory it has taken. It has kept the spending credits and travel perks attractive enough that Low said he is paying the annual $450 fee again to renew and tossing other cards in his sock drawer. And, the bank is promoting Sapphire Reserve in the first television ads it has launched in 18 months for a consumer credit card. The ads show late night talk show wit James Corden asking millennials to plan his next vacation as they travel the world with the card.

310,AXP,U.S. top court to review antitrust claims against American Express,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide whether American Express Co (AXP.N) is violating federal antitrust law by forbidding merchants that accept its credit cards from encouraging customers to use rival cards that charge lower fees. The justices will hear an appeal by 11 states led by Ohio that had sued American Express of a 2016 lower court ruling that endorsed the legality of the company’s “anti-steering” provisions in contracts with merchants. Merchants annually pay more than $50 billion in so-called swipe fees to process credit card transactions, and these fees can be passed along to customers through higher prices. New York-based American Express charges merchants higher fees relative to the other credit card networks, and generates more revenue, according to the states’ legal papers. The company accounts for about 26 percent of all U.S. credit card transactions. As a result of advertising campaigns in the 1980s by competitors Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) aimed at convincing merchants and consumers to use cards with cheaper fees, American Express tightened contract provisions with merchants to stop what it called discrimination against its cards.  American Express said in a statement it will “vigorously defend” the lower court’s ruling before the nine justices. It said the earlier ruling “protects a consumer’s right to choose how they pay, prevents our card members from being discriminated against and promotes competition in the payments industry.”  In a court filing, the company said that lower fees paid by merchants would mean fewer benefits for cardholders. The Obama administration and 17 U.S. states sued American Express in 2010 alleging that the company’s anti-steering contract requirement obstructs merchants from using competition to try to keep credit card fees from increasing. A trial court agreed, finding that the rules kept lower cost networks out of the field and led to higher prices for merchants and consumers. In September 2016, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York overturned that ruling.  The states - Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, Rhode Island, Utah and Vermont - appealed the 2nd Circuit ruling to the Supreme Court.  Visa and MasterCard settled similar lawsuits in 2011 by agreeing to change their rules. A number of companies backed the states’ appeal in the American Express case, including supermarket and drugstore chains Kroger Co (KR.N) and Walgreens(WBA.O), which said credit card fees are among their largest and fastest-growing expenses.  Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) said in a legal brief that American Express had insulated itself from competitive market forces, resulting in “hundreds of millions (if not billions) of dollars in excess costs incurred by Southwest, other merchants, and their customers.” ",10162017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-american-express/u-s-top-court-to-review-antitrust-claims-against-american-express-idUSKBN1CL1X6

326,AXP,AmEx to post fourth-quarter loss on $2.4 billion hit from tax legislation,"(Reuters) - American Express Co (AXP.N) said it expects to report a fourth-quarter loss due to a $2.4 billion hit from the tax legislation which makes it cheaper for U.S. companies to repatriate profits. The company also said it expects full-year 2017 earnings to be below its $5.80-$5.90 per share forecast. (bit.ly/2CyIWfT) The impacts of the tax act in the fourth quarter will reduce American Express’ regulatory capital and capital ratios for the fourth quarter, the company said. In the long run, AmEx expects the lower corporate tax rate to be a significant benefit. The company anticipates effective tax rate in the low twenties before discrete tax items in 2018. Congress’ U.S. tax overhaul bill, which President Donald Trump signed into law last month, significantly cuts the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. According to the new law, profits brought back to the United States would not be taxed at the full 35-percent corporate tax rate that would normally be due. Instead, those profits would be taxed at only 15.5 percent for cash assets and 8 percent for illiquid assets. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said last week it also expects fourth-quarter earnings to decrease by about $5 billion due to the tax legislation.

Hogg Robinson said GBT would pay up to 120 pence per share, which according to Reuters calculations would value the company at up to 393.1 million pounds ($549.6 million), a nearly 54 percent premium to the stock’s close on Thursday. U.S. credit card issuer American Express Co has a 50 percent holding in American Express GBT. Visa said it would pay 141.8 million pounds for Fraedom. However, if the Fraedom sale does not complete prior to a court meeting to approve the AmEx GBT takeover, Hogg Robinson said its shareholders would receive a minimum consideration of 110 pence per share in cash. Visa said separately that it expected the Fraedom deal to close in the first quarter of 2018. Shares of Hogg Robinson were up 48 percent at 116 pence at 0911 GMT in thin trading.

334,AXP,UPDATE 2-U.S. Supreme Court liberals skeptical of American Express merchant fees,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices on Monday sharply questioned American Express Co (AXP.N) over its policy of forbidding merchants from encouraging customers to use rival credit cards with lower fees, a practice that some states and the Trump administration have concluded violates federal antitrust law. The high court heard about an hour of arguments in an appeal by the states, led by Ohio, of a 2016 ruling by a lower court in New York that cleared American Express of unlawfully stifling competition through its so-called anti-steering provisions in contracts with merchants.  While liberal Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer signaled hostility toward the company’s policy, conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch indicated support for American Express. It was less clear how the other conservative justices would vote. The court has a 5-4 conservative majority. Merchants like a local coffee shop might be able to pass lower transaction fees on to customers in the form of cheaper prices, except that the anti-steering measures prevent them from doing so, Kagan said.  “That sounds like a market that is not working the way it’s supposed to,” Kagan told Evan Chesler, the attorney for American Express.  The case could have major implications for the credit card industry and particularly American Express, whose business model is closely tied to the fees it charges to merchants for each transaction. These fees, it said, fund the additional benefits it offers its cardholders compared to competitors. American Express said its system has allowed it to compete against the dominant networks, Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc(MA.N). The states, backed by President Donald Trump’s  administration, argued that the anti-steering policy violates antitrust law, blocks lower-fee rivals, raises fees for merchants and inflates retail prices for everyone, including those who do not use credit cards. The legal issue centered on how courts find antitrust violations when businesses cater to two groups at the same time and limits on competition for one side might offer benefits for the other. The two groups in this case are cardholders and merchants but the ruling would likely reverberate more widely because the dynamic is common in other industries, such as advertising and e-commerce. Gorsuch expressed doubts about the states’ arguments. “Do you have any evidence that, on a net basis, consumers pay more?” he asked Ohio State Solicitor Eric Murphy. “I don’t believe you have.”  Breyer said the key question was whether there is an anti-competitive aspect to the American Express conduct.  “It seems to me obvious, of course, there is,” he said.  Merchants annually pay more than $50 billion in so-called swipe fees to process credit card transactions. New York-based American Express charges merchants higher fees relative to the other credit card networks, and generates more revenue, according to the states’ legal papers. The company accounts for about 26 percent of all U.S. credit card transactions. The Justice Department and 17 U.S. states sued American Express in 2010, alleging that the company’s anti-steering contract requirements obstruct merchants from using competition to try to keep credit card fees from increasing. Visa and MasterCard settled similar lawsuits in 2010 by agreeing to change their rules.

342,AXP,AmEx profit tops estimates as record splurge on rewards woos customers,"(Reuters) - Credit card issuer American Express Co (AXP.N) easily topped Wall Street targets for quarterly profit as record investments in card rewards and a strengthening U.S. economy contributed to higher customer spending. Shares of AmEx, which ended 1.4 percent higher on Wednesday, added another 3.5 percent in after-hours trading. New York-based AmEx spent a record $2.35 billion in customer rewards during the first three months of the year, seeking to woo more high-spending customers and counter competition from major U.S. banks. JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), Citigroup (C.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N), which have all begun offering premium cards, each saw their card businesses grow in the first quarter. “Today’s results are showing good returns on the investments we’ve been making to drive growth in the premium sector,” AmEx Chief Executive Stephen Squeri said in a statement. Higher marketing expenses are the “table stakes” in the premium card category, analysts at Jefferies Group said last week, forecasting that industry-wide investments will continue to grow because of high competition. AmEx on Wednesday also said it expects 2018 earnings at the high end of its estimated range of its $6.90 to $7.30 per share. Analysts on average were expecting $7.11 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said first-quarter card customer spending increased 3 percent in the United States and 7 percent worldwide. Consumer spending in the United States rose in January and February. AmEx’s net income rose to $1.63 billion or $1.86 per share in the quarter ended March 31, from $1.25 billion or $1.35 per share a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.71 per share. Total revenue, net of interest expense, climbed 12 percent to $9.72 billion, topping analysts’ forecasts of $9.46 billion. AmEx is confident of resuming stock buybacks in the second half of 2018, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Campbell said on a call with analysts.
