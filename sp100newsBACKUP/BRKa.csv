According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Buffett donated on Thursday 19.34 million Class B shares of his insurance and investment company Berkshire Hathaway Inc to the Gates Foundation.  The B shares closed up $1.25 at $77.77, while Berkshire Class A shares closed up $1,840 at $116,640.  Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft Corp and a Berkshire director, and his wife Melinda created the Gates Foundation to address education, health and poverty problems.

The Gates Foundation said it employs 927 people, spent $2.6 billion last year, and has a $37.1 billion endowment.  Buffett expects the foundation to spend his gifts, which have totaled roughly $9.5 billion.  The number of shares that Buffett donates declines by 5 percent each year.

3,BRKa,Citi hit Moody's hurdle in OneMain sale: source,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc (C.N) is finding its consumer finance unit, OneMain Financial, to be a tough sell.  In recent days, Moody’s Investors Service gave OneMain a lower preliminary credit rating than what the U.S. bank had been expecting, making it more expensive to finance a deal, according to a source familiar with the situation on Wednesday.  Citigroup redid the capital and deal structure it had been working on for months following the unexpected blow, and decided to retain $3 billion of OneMain loans, the source said.  Citigroup is now in exclusive negotiations with Centerbridge Capital Partners LLC and Leucadia National Corp, three sources said.  Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) has also joined that group, according to the Wall Street Journal.  Citigroup has been insisting on getting book value for the unit, the sources said, but the prospective buyer could resist that demand.  “I just find it hard to believe that they will ultimately wind up getting the price they expect because the funding has gotten so much more expensive,” one of the sources said.  The setback from Moody’s comes on top of concessions to potential buyers that Citigroup had made earlier and highlights how hard the third-largest U.S. bank will have to work to shed the $337 billion of problem assets on its balance sheet.  Some investors fear that as Citigroup sells what it can from Citi Holdings — the unit that holds those assets — it could be left holding many of the toxic loans that it’s trying to shed.  OneMain, which was previously known as CitiFinancial, has a book value of about $2 billion and initially came with roughly $13 billion of assets.  The $3 billion in loans that Citigroup is retaining now add to billions of dollars of OneMain assets it had decided to keep before starting the auction.  Any buyer would have to find ways to fund OneMain’s assets through various types of debt and equity.  Now the presence of Buffett, one of the world’s richest men, could prove to be key in the bidding group’s ability to do the deal.  “Financing is the most complex part of it,” the source said. “If you got Warren Buffett, there is only one guy who has to make a decision about putting money into the company.”  Still, the source added that any buyer would likely want Citigroup to provide some credit support for an extended period of time.  In March, sources said Citigroup was offering partial financing and was open to also retaining a stake in the consumer finance business. [ID:nN08101968]  Citigroup and Centerbridge declined to comment. Berkshire Hathaway, Leucadia and Moody’s did not respond immediately to a request for comment.  Citigroup considers its target retail customers to be wealthy people globally, while OneMain focuses on lower-income borrowers through its network of 1,300 branches in the United States.  But buyout shops have been eyeing U.S. consumer finance assets, looking to take advantage of a shrinking supply of consumer loans to people with credit problems as firms like Citigroup exit the market.  OneMain’s auction initially attracted a Who’s Who of private equity firms, but the field narrowed as Citigroup’s insistence on being paid book and the huge financing hurdle proved to be too much for many firms to overcome, sources have said previously.  In the end, the groups that remained in the race included a consortium led by Brysam Global Partners, and another consisting of Apollo Management and J.C. Flowers, sources said.  Last week after Moody’s came back with the preliminary rating for OneMain, Citigroup wanted the remaining bidders to re-confirm a book value bid based on the new capital and deal structures, the source said.  Citigroup picked the Centerbridge consortium for exclusive talks, the source said.

6,BRKa,Ex-Goldman director Gupta may pursue SEC lawsuit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc director Rajat Gupta may pursue his lawsuit accusing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of violating his rights by denying him a jury trial in an insider-trading case.  U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff rejected the SEC motion to dismiss Gupta’s case, which stemmed from the agency beginning administrative proceedings against him on March 1.  Gupta, a former chief of consulting firm McKinsey & Co, was accused by the SEC of passing tips to Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam about Goldman and Procter & Gamble Co, where Gupta was once also a director.  The tips included alleged details about financial results, and a $5 billion investment in Goldman from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc at the height of the 2008 financial crisis.  On May 11, a federal jury convicted Rajaratnam of 14 securities fraud and conspiracy charges related to insider trading. Prosecutors named Gupta as an unindicted co-conspirator, but have not charged him criminally.  In his ruling, Rakoff said Gupta may argue that the SEC violated his equal protection rights by singling him out from other defendants it had sued in the Galleon case.  Some protections in federal court, including rights to have a jury trial, obtain some evidence and raise counterclaims, are not available in administrative proceedings.  “We have the unusual case where there is already a well developed public record of Gupta being treated substantially disparately from 28 essentially identical defendants, with not even a hint from the SEC, even in their instant papers, as to why this should be so,” Rakoff wrote.  The allegations of unequal treatment, if made properly, “would state a claim even if Gupta were entirely guilty of the charges made against him,” Rakoff added.  Gary Naftalis, a lawyer for Gupta, declined to comment on Rakoff’s decision. He has previously called the SEC charges “baseless.”  SEC spokesman John Nester declined to comment.  In his March 18 complaint, Gupta alleged that the SEC chose to bring administrative proceedings, authorized under last year’s Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, “for the bad faith purpose of shoring up a meritless case by disarming its adversary.”  Rakoff said it is unnecessary to decide whether Dodd-Frank should be applied retroactively to Gupta, and that the issue could very likely become moot.  The judge ordered expedited treatment of Gupta’s lawsuit, with a hearing on evidence within four months.  Last month, a U.S. administrative law judge delayed Gupta’s administrative proceedings, once scheduled for July 18, for six months after federal prosecutors filed motions to intervene.  At Rajaratnam’s trial, prosecutors played secretly recorded phone calls to show Gupta’s alleged tips.  In one, Rajaratnam and Gupta discussed a Goldman board meeting. In another, Rajaratnam told a Galleon colleague that a Goldman director provided him with details that the bank was on track for a surprise loss in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Rajaratnam is expected to be sentenced in the criminal case on September 27. He also faces SEC civil charges.  The case is Gupta v.

The company, which also makes battery and mobile phone parts, said sales of its handset parts and assembly business also declined during the six month period after a major customer postponed orders, according to a statement filed at the Shenzhen stock exchange on Tuesday.	   BYD forecast its net profit for the first six months of the year at between 121.06 million yuan ($18.7 million) and 363.18 million yuan, down 85-95 percent from 2.42 billion yuan a year earlier, based on the company’s preliminary estimate.	   Two analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S forecast on average a first half net profit of 576.7 million yuan.	   “It’s below my expectation and there is a chance that they make a loss in the second quarter,” said Steven Man, an analyst at Samsung Securities.	   The company reported a net profit of 266.74 million yuan for the first quarter of 2011, down 84 percent year-on-year.	   Man said he would lower his annual net profit forecast for the company, which is currently at 2.8 billion yuan.	   BYD said sales were affected by the government’s move to cancel a tax incentive for cars with engines of 1.6 litres or below this year. Its gross profit margin also fell in the first half due to falling revenue in all divisions.	   The company raised 1.42 billion yuan in June by selling domestic Chinese shares listed in the Shenzhen stock exchange. These shares ended down 4 percent on Tuesday at 31.51 yuan, but were still 75 percent above their initial public offering price.	   Its Hong Kong-listed shares dropped 6.1 percent, underperforming a 3 percent loss in the blue-chip Hang Seng Index . The stock has lost nearly 44 percent this year on weak car sales.	   BYD, the country’s sixth-largest carmaker by sales, competes with larger rivals such as SAIC Motor Corp Ltd , which has joint ventures with General Motors and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE). Its car sales dropped nearly 20 percent in the first six months to about 232,268, according to company and historic data.

Well-known credit derivatives expert Janet Tavakoli said on Wednesday she will auction off a charity lunch in New York, much like the one Buffett does every year.   The oft-quoted Tavakoli is the author of a popular Buffett biography and is a past lunch companion of the investor known as the “Oracle of Omaha.” His Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) conglomerate owns businesses from insurance to ice cream.   The “first derivative lunch auction” will entitle the winner to eat with Tavakoli and three friends at Michael’s in New York City.   Proceeds from the auction, being hosted by the website uBid, will benefit the National Safe Haven Alliance, which works to help promote “safe haven” laws for abandoned babies. Bidding begins July 18 and runs to Aug. 1.   Buffett auctions off a lunch at a New York steakhouse every year to benefit a San Francisco charity. This year’s lunch sold for $2.63 million.

12,BRKa,Bonneville defends wind curtailment in FERC filing,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - The Bonneville Power Administration urged federal regulators to dismiss a complaint filed by wind farm owners in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, saying that the agency’s policy to cut wind generation without compensation is needed to maintain grid reliability, according to a filing made late on Tuesday.  The largest snowpack since 1997 boosted Northwest river levels this spring, complicating competition between hydro and wind interests in the region where Bonneville (BPA) operates the lion’s share of the high-voltage power network.  In its response to a complaint filed at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) last month, BPA said it adopted its “environmental redispatch” policy to balance surplus hydro power while dealing with “a myriad of statutory responsibilities.”  “This policy has effectively maintained the reliability of the transmission system and reduced harm to endangered species,” BPA said. “The commission should not take action that could remove this critical tool from the agency.”  From mid-May until early July, BPA curtailed wind generation nearly every day to increase its hydro output to protect salmon and other fish, the agency said.  In the complaint, a coalition of owners of nearly 2,000 megawatts of wind generation said BPA’s policy was an unfair use of the grid, costing generators lost income and discouraging development of renewable power resources in the region.  While BPA offered to replace wind farm output with hydropower so that wind generators still get paid by their customers, they can lose money in other ways, including lost production tax credits and renewable energy credits (RECs).  The complaint was filed by Iberdrola Renewables, an affiliate of Spain’s largest utility; PacifiCorp, a unit of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co, the electric unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc; Horizon Wind Energy, a unit of EDP Renewables which is part of Portugal’s largest utility; NextEra Energy and privately ownedInvenergy.  Is has attracted dozens of intervenors, including supporters like the Oregon Public Utility Commission and an environmental coalition that said BPA’s policy did not benefit fish.  However, a majority of parties that want to be heard are public power utilities in the Northwest.  The American Public Power Association and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association sided with Bonneville, asking FERC to reject the complaint due to FERC’s limited legal authority over BPA.  “It’s an important regional issue and should be treated like that,” said BPA spokesman Doug Johnson. “We all are committed to reliability and to meeting our environmental requirements. We can’t abandon that, but we are willing to explore solutions and would like to get back to the work of doing that.”  Daily wind curtailments ended this month as high water conditions subsided, Johnson said. From mid-May to July 10, BPA cut 97,557 megawatt-hours of wind generation, according to the agency’s website.  Wind generators said the curtailments which occurred in the overnight hours when power demand and prices were low were made for economic reasons and violated BPA’s contracts with generators.  “We tried for over a year to come to some agreement,” said Don Furman, a senior vice president for Iberdrola Renewables. “They were not willing to refrain from curtailing us for economic reasons.”  ",7202011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-utilites-bonneville-ferc/bonneville-defends-wind-curtailment-in-ferc-filing-idUSTRE76J7U620110720

14,BRKa,"UPDATE 3-POSCO warns of slow steel demand, high costs in H2"," * Q2 operating profit 1.5 trln won vs. 1.46 trln won forecast   * Raw material costs, oversupply after Japan quake bite   * Sees H2 operating profit slightly lower than H1   * Shares finish up 0.9 pct prior to results   (Adds comments, details)	   By Hyunjoo Jin	   SEOUL, July 22 (Reuters) - POSCO , the world’s No.3 steelmaker, warned of weakening demand growth and persistently high input costs in the second half, after posting a 17 percent fall in quarterly operating profit.	   Steelmakers’ earnings are set to be further squeezed as record production in China floods the market when demand is under pressure from  tightening monetary policy in China and debt problems in Europe and the United States.	   High prices of iron ore and coking coal, which rose between  25 and 47 percent quarter on quarter in April-June, show no signs of a sharp retreat.	   “Sluggish demand and the oversupply issue will stay for the time being (and) Chinese demand will not strengthen. Investors do not find POSCO attractive,” said Kim Se-hoon, a fund manager at Assetplus Investment Management, which owns POSCO shares.	   POSCO, which trails ArcelorMittal and Baosteel  , did not give a profit outlook for this year in its earnings statement, but its CFO Choi Jong-tae told reporters that its second-half operating profit was expected to be “slightly lower” than the first half’s 2.4 trillion won.	   It reported 1.5 trillion won ($1.4 billion) in April-June operating profit, broadly in line with the consensus forecast of 1.46 trillion won in a poll by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.	   The South Korean firm raised its domestic product prices for the first time in nine months in April, which helped sales rise by 27 percent to 10 trillion won, but profit dipped as it failed to fully pass on cost increases.	   The price rise was also overshadowed by cheaper imports from Japanese rivals struggling to make up for a demand slump from customers such as automakers after the March 11 earthquake.	   Tightening in China, the world’s top steel producer and consumer, may weigh on demand from sectors such as automobiles, while planned construction of 10 million affordable houses this year alone is expected to keep steel output at close to record levels.	   “The steel market is expected to bottom out in the third quarter and gradually improve,” POSCO said in a statement.	   Shares in POSCO, which counts billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) as a major shareholder, have underperformed the wider market this year.	   The stock closed up 0.9 percent ahead of the earnings release on Friday in a market that gained 1.2 percent.	   “Many institutional investors have already slashed their holdings of POSCO and instead added its smaller but nimble rivals such as Hyundai Steel, as its growth outlook is not bright,” said Jung Sang-jin, a fund manager at Dongbu Asset management.	   “With POSCO shares already lagging the market, the stock is unlikely to fall sharply from the current level.”	   POSCO, which generates around two thirds of its revenue from the home market, faces rising competition from cross-town rival Hyundai Steel , which started its second blast furnace this year.	   POSCO said its 2011 crude steel output would rise 10 percent to 37.1 million tonnes, while sales are seen rising to 39.9 trillion won from 32.6 trillion won a year ago.	   The firm, which plans 7.3 trillion won of investment this year, said it was not considering bidding for a controlling stake in its core client Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering .	   POSCO has been on an active acquisition trail in recent years, snapping up trading firm Daewoo International  and Thainox Stainless .

17,BRKa,UPDATE 1-BPA to hike U.S. Northwest power rates by 7.8 pct," * U.S. Northwest rates remain among nation’s lowest   * No transmission rate increase   * BPA to lower rates to integrate more wind  (Adds link to BPA wind story)   NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Pacific Northwest’s Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) adopted a 7.8 percent average wholesale power rate hike that takes effect Oct. 1.   In a release Tuesday, BPA, the U.S.-owned power company that operates the federal Columbia River hydropower dams, said the new rates will support needed improvements to the region’s 31 federal dams and the Columbia nuclear plant.   Despite any rate increase, power costs in the Pacific Northwest are expected to remain among the lowest in the nation because of that low cost hydropower.   The average retail price of power is 6.6 cents per kilowatt hour in Washington State and 7.4 cents in Oregon, versus a national average of 9.8 cents for the nation, according to federal data.   BPA, which also manages 75 percent of the power transmission lines in the Northwest, said transmission rates will hold steady or decrease under this rate plan.   And for wind generators, who have fought BPA this year over having their output curtailed to allow more hydropower to reach the power lines, BPA said it would slightly reduce the rates to integrate wind farms. [ID:nN1E76J263]   BPA said it was able to hold down its 2012-2013 wholesale power rate increase by relying more heavily borrowings from the U.S. Treasury, instead of replenishing its reserves, among other things.   In addition, BPA announced on Tuesday it settled a long-standing residential exchange program dispute over how benefits from the federal hydro system are divided between public and investor-owned utilities.   As part of that settlement, BPA said it would distribute about $3.3 billion to investor-owned utilities over the 17-year term of the settlement, beginning at $182.1 million in fiscal 2012 and increasing to $286.1 million by fiscal 2028.   Investor owned utilities in the area include units of Avista (AVA.N), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) and Portland General (POR.N).   For consumer owned utilities, BPA said it will distribute about $612 million, paid at $76.5 million per year from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2019.   “We need to make careful investments to protect the substantial value of the Northwest power system, but we also need to keep rates as low as possible, especially since the economy is still struggling,” said Steve Wright, BPA administrator.   “This rate strikes a balance that allows us to replace and refurbish aging equipment at the dams and Columbia Generating Station and maintains the momentum of our efforts to protect endangered salmon.”   BPA said it will reduce the rate for integrating wind onto its transmission grid by 4.7 percent.   BPA said the cost of integrating more wind is increasing but the reduction was possible because some additional geographic diversity of the wind projects.   There are more than 3,500 megawatts of wind connected to the BPA transmission system. By Sept. 30, 2013, BPA said that amount is expected to grow to about 5,500 MW.   One megawatt can power about 1,000 homes.   BPA anticipates having the capability to integrate the projected wind coming onto the system through 2013, but noted it was “rapidly running out of system flexibility.”   To deal with the growing wind power resources, BPA said it has developed mechanisms to acquire more balancing reserves if the amount of wind outpaces its ability to integrate it.   If the need for more reserves arises, BPA said it established mechanisms to pass those costs on to the customers using the service and said it was providing options for wind generators to obtain additional service or lower costs by committing to adjust their schedules every half hour.

18,BRKa,Analysis: New asbestos charges point to reserve woes,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Asbestos-related diseases have been falling for a decade, but warnings from a pair of U.S. insurance giants about new claims raise questions about the industry’s ability to put the scourge behind it.  While medical evidence suggests fewer new cases of asbestosis and the lung cancer mesothelioma, insurers say they are getting sued more frequently and aggressively by people with claims against “peripheral insureds,” such as contractors that worked on projects where asbestos was used.  As some of these lawsuits succeed in courts across the country, it fuels new suits by aggressive plaintiffs’ lawyers and compounds the problem for insurers trying to understand their exposure.  The disconnect between a waning disease and flourishing claims also exposes a flaw endemic to insurers. When they set aside reserves for indistinct risks, they are making guesses — even if educated ones — on how long a particular risk will endure and what it will cost them to be done with it.  No law says any particular company’s guess has to match anyone else’s, but investors raise alarms about companies where reserves are not in line with peers.  That’s why Hartford Financial’s announcement this month of a $290 million pretax earnings hit from increasing reserves for asbestos cases fostered concerns beyond the insurer’s citation of rising claims for mesothelioma.  “Although these items are one-time events, the result raises questions about ... reserve adequacy,” Barclays Capital analyst Jay Gelb said in a note to investors. He was referring to both the asbestos charge and Hartford’s sharp rise in second-quarter catastrophe losses.  American International Group Inc similarly riled investors in early February with a $4.1 billion addition to its reserves, including more than $1 billion related to its asbestos exposure.  Fitch Ratings responded by cutting the credit rating on AIG’s domestic property unit insurance units, calling the charges “a significant outlier” compared to competitors and the whole property insurance market.  According to insurance ratings agency AM Best, the Hartford had the fourth-highest level of asbestos and environmental reserves of all large property insurers at the end of 2009 while AIG ranked seventh. They also ranked in the top seven in terms of average annual asbestos losses in 2005-2009.  AIG and The Hartford are in particularly sensitive positions since they were two of the three insurers who took government bailouts during the financial crisis. Their reserve accounting has not been questioned by any of their regulators.  For decades asbestos was a favorite material in building products, naval applications and other industrial settings because of its fire-retardant properties. Over time, though, exposure to its microscopic fibers causes health problems.  More recently, many of the rescue workers at the Ground Zero site in New York after the 9/11 attacks were exposed to high concentrations of asbestos - in some cases, reports have said, nearly a million times the normal background level.  To be sure, some of the new claims stem from plaintiffs’ lawyers becoming more effective at suing people who are only peripherally connected to asbestos victims. Late-night cable television is flooded with ads from asbestos lawyers, and “mesothelioma” is among the most valuable of advertising keywords on Google. Since there is still plenty of asbestos in buildings across the country, it is also possible that new cases are adding to insurers’ burdens.  Best warned in February that the insurance industry is generally underfunded in its asbestos reserves. It cited a growing number of legal claims reflecting a weakening of tort reform in some states and the “ongoing filing of mesothelioma claims for years to come.”  Asbestos claims have been a bane of insurers for at least a decade. They nearly brought down the Lloyd’s of London market in the 1990s and have cost some of the industry’s largest players billions of dollars. Insurers like MetLife were accused for decades of helping to conceal the deadly side effects of the fire retardant.  In recent years, insurance investors have been celebrating the steady decline of asbestos-related claims and reserves. According to the Insurance Information Institute, reserves grew every year from 2001 to 2005, then shrank every year since through 2009.  The trend appeared to be tracking the medical evidence. New cases of malignant mesothelioma, a lung cancer caused only by asbestos exposure that one oncologist called a “tremendously lousy disease,” declined at an annual rate of 1.8 percent from 1999 to 2008, according to the American Cancer Society.  “I am surprised myself to hear insurers are (seeing) more claims, because we think with the reduction of asbestos years back we’re starting to see a reduction in incidence of the disease,” said Kevin Becker, an oncologist at Maimonides Medical Center in New York.  Annual reports from MetLife, the country’s largest life insurer, show new claims and total outstanding claims dropping at a steady pace from 2003 through 2010, declining around 40 percent over the period.  The sums paid annually by the industry as settlements also have generally been shrinking. A.M. Best’s forecast that the insurance industry may ultimately end up paying $75 billion in asbestos claims over time seems inflated to some regulators.  “I can’t speak for everyone out there but (claims) may be a little less than that,” said Joseph Torti, Rhode Island’s superintendent of insurance and the designated spokesman on asbestos issues for the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.  LONG-TERM CHALLENGE  But deciding to build or draw down reserves remains a crapshoot for insurers.  Mesothelioma has an incredibly long latency period, meaning 30 years or more can pass between exposure to asbestos and the onset of the cancer. That is why companies such as Travelers and Berkshire Hathaway continue to build reserves.  “Trends were kind of favorable, but you still see the companies with exposure kind of trickling up their reserves from time to time,” said Jim Auden, head of the property and casualty insurance unit at Fitch Ratings.  Another concern for insurers are new and expensive therapies being developed to treat mesothelioma.  The upshot? Asbestos claims and payments are not going away, and no one knows when the bend will turn.  “You wish that this would be completed,” Auden said. “These claims are tied to activities in the ‘70s mostly (and) you still can’t get your arms around it.”  ",7282011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-insurance-asbestos/analysis-new-asbestos-charges-point-to-reserve-woes-idUSTRE76R4CW20110728
19,BRKa,"UPDATE 4-Ex-General Re, AIG execs' convictions thrown out","   * Ex-Gen Re CEO, others win reversal of convictions   * Appeals court cites errors by trial judge   * Transaction said to inflate AIG’s loss reserves  (Adds comment by lawyer, paragraph 17)   By Jonathan Stempel and Ben Berkowitz   NEW YORK, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Four former executives at Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s General Re Corp unit and one at American International Group Inc won the reversal of their convictions over a reinsurance transaction that prosecutors said fraudulently boosted AIG’s loss reserves.   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York ordered on Monday a new trial for all five defendants, including former General Re Chief Executive Ronald Ferguson, citing errors by the presiding judge at their closely watched 2008 trial.   Prosecutors had accused the defendants of engineering a sham transaction in 2000 that let AIG inflate its loss reserves by $500 million without transferring risk.   The transaction helped lead to the 2005 ouster of AIG’s longtime chief executive, Maurice “Hank” Greenberg.   Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) chief executive, was questioned by investigators about the transaction but was not implicated or accused of wrongdoing.   The other defendants whose convictions were thrown out are former General Re Chief Financial Officer Elizabeth Monrad, former Senior Vice President Christopher Garand and former Assistant General Counsel Robert Graham, as well as former AIG (AIG.N) Vice President Christian Milton. They have been free on bail pending their appeals.   It is unclear whether prosecutors will retry the case. The office of U.S. Attorney David Fein in Connecticut did not return calls seeking a comment.   The reinsurance arrangement took place well before AIG in 2008 and 2009 accepted $182.3 billion of taxpayer-funded bailouts amid the global financial crisis. The government still owns a majority of AIG.   In its decision, the 2nd Circuit said the trial judge, U.S. District Judge Christopher Droney in Hartford, Connecticut, erred in admitting data suggesting that the transaction caused a 12 percent decline in AIG’s stock price in early 2005, when details about it became known.   The court said the data were prejudicial because there were other problems, including bid-rigging and earnings manipulation allegations, that could have also hurt the insurer’s stock price.   “The defendants’ substantial rights were affected,” Chief Judge Dennis Jacobs wrote for the appeals court.   Jacobs also said Droney did not properly instruct jurors on how to decide whether the defendants had committed fraud.   Droney sentenced Milton to four years in prison, Ferguson to two years, Monrad to 1-1/2 years, and Garand and Graham to one year each, following a six-week trial.   Two other former General Re executives, John Houldsworth and Richard Napier, pleaded guilty in the case and were sentenced to probation.   In May, President Barack Obama nominated Droney to serve on the 2nd Circuit.   Frederick Hafetz, a lawyer for Milton, said: “We are very gratified by the decision, and look forward to a new trial.”   Alan Vinegrad, a lawyer for Graham, also said he was gratified by the decision.   Lawyers for the remaining defendants did not return calls seeking comment.   Greenberg is still dealing with fallout from General Re, including a 2005 civil fraud lawsuit in which then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer accused him of structuring transactions to hide AIG losses.   That case has yet to go to trial, and Greenberg in March lost a bid to remove the presiding judge on bias grounds after that judge called the government’s case “devastating.”   In 2006, AIG agreed to pay $1.64 billion to settle state and federal probes into its business practices.   General Re, meanwhile, agreed in January 2010 to pay $92.2 million to end a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe over alleged sham transactions with AIG and Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N).   The case is U.S. v. Ferguson et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 08-6211.  (Editing by Gerald E.

20,BRKa,"Ex-Goldman director Gupta, SEC to drop litigation","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) director Rajat Gupta and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are dropping litigation against each other stemming from the sprawling federal insider trading probe.  The agreement, revealed Thursday in a court filing, for now ends litigation against Gupta, a former chief of consulting firm McKinsey & Co and one of the highest-profile defendants accused by the government of wrongdoing.  Investigators have said Gupta passed tips to Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam about Goldman, including a possible multibillion dollar investment from Warren Buffett, and Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), where Gupta was also a director.  Prosecutors named Gupta as an unindicted co-conspirator in that case, which led to Rajaratnam’s conviction in May, but have not charged him criminally.  Citing the “public interest,” the SEC dismissed administrative proceedings filed on March 1 accusing Gupta of passing tips illegally to Rajaratnam.  “Dismissing these proceedings will not prevent the Commission from filing an action against Mr. Gupta in United States District Court,” the dismissal order shows.  As a result of the dismissal, Gupta agreed to dismiss his lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court against the SEC.  In it, Gupta accused the regulator of depriving him of a jury trial and other procedural safeguards by bringing administrative proceedings rather than filing a lawsuit.  A two-page letter agreement between Gupta and the SEC was made public on Thursday by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who presided over Gupta’s lawsuit. He said that agreement will moot that case.  “Mr. Gupta is very pleased that as a result of his lawsuit the SEC has dismissed its administrative proceeding and he will no longer be singled out for disparate treatment,” his lawyer Gary Naftalis said in a statement. “Mr. Gupta’s lawsuit against the SEC has achieved all of the relief he sought. As we’ve said previously, the SEC’s allegations are totally baseless.”  SEC spokesman John Nester said: “The staff is fully committed to the case and will proceed as appropriate.”  A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in New York declined to comment.  Gupta had been accused by the SEC of passing advance tips about Goldman’s financial results, and a $5 billion investment from Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) at the height of the 2008 financial crisis.  On May 11, a federal jury convicted Rajaratnam of 14 securities fraud and conspiracy charges related to insider trading.  At Rajaratnam’s trial, prosecutors played secretly recorded phone calls to show Gupta’s alleged tips.  In one, Rajaratnam and Gupta discussed a Goldman board meeting. In another, Rajaratnam told a Galleon colleague that a Goldman director provided him with details that the bank was on track for a surprise loss in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Rajaratnam is expected to be sentenced in the criminal case on September 27. He also faces SEC civil charges.  The case is Gupta v.

24,BRKa,"Berkshire profit rises on rails, manufacturing","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) reported a larger second-quarter profit on Friday, as favorable investment results and strength in the rail and manufacturing businesses offset another underwriting loss in insurance.  The 80-year-old “Oracle of Omaha” warned in April the insurance business was probably going to post an underwriting loss for the year because of the severe earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand in the first quarter.  Analysts and investors said the quarter was much as they expected, although the long-term questions about Buffett’s succession plans remain. Buffett has said Berkshire will separate his CEO and investment chief roles when he is gone, but has given no clarity on who will fill them.  Berkshire reported a net profit of $3.42 billion, or $2,072 per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $1.97 billion, or $1,195 per share.  Revenues at the insurance business rose by roughly $2 billion from a year earlier, driven by an asbestos reinsurance contract with AIG (AIG.N). On a net basis, though, the unit had an underwriting loss of $7 million due to natural disasters.  “You can’t look at insurance in a vacuum over one quarter,” said Tom Lewandowski, financial services analyst at Edward Jones. “I’m not overly disappointed.”  Revenue also was up sharply at the railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, and earnings rose nearly 15 percent year-on-year. Berkshire said it managed to handle more rail cars and to get higher revenue per car.  Profits were sharply higher in the manufacturing, service and retailing segment, reflecting a wide array of stronger results in lines including engineered products, metalworking and building products.  One of the downsides in the quarter was manufactured housing business Clayton Homes, where revenue from home sales declined 30 percent and the average price per home sold also fell.  Besides the operating results, the company also benefited from better investment results than in prior periods.  Berkshire recorded smaller losses on a derivative position linked to stock markets, $184 million versus a loss of $2.18 billion a year earlier. Though he has condemned derivatives generally, Buffett has said this particular investment could be lucrative for the company over time.  The company also had no writedowns in the second quarter for other-than-temporary losses on stocks. Berkshire has been under pressure from securities regulators to more quickly recognize losses on shareholdings when those stocks have been in a loss position for more than a year.  Book value per share, Buffett’s preferred measure of the conglomerate’s worth, rose 3.4 percent to $98,716 per Class A-equivalent share. One investor said the company’s shares are at the second-lowest multiple to book value he has seen in the last 30 years.  “The stock is crazy undervalued,” said Steve Check, president of Check Capital Management in Costa Mesa, California, whose largest shareholding is Berkshire Class B stock. “In plain daylight you have a very large, stable company about 35 percent underpriced.”  But despite that attractive valuation, Lewandowski had a “hold” rating on the stock because of questions about what Berkshire will do with its cash — $47.89 billion at the end of the quarter, nearly $20 billion more than a year ago and $6.7 billion more than at the end of the first quarter.  That and the unanswered question of who will run Berkshire after Buffett steps aside are key parts of the investment story, he said.  “You have these concerns, you generate all this cash, you’ve got to put all that cash to work,” he said. “There’s a reason why we’ve seen the multiples contract.”  ",8052011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire/berkshire-profit-rises-on-rails-manufacturing-idUSTRE7746S120110805

The Silicon Valley-based company is regarded to be the leading software maker for the $1.7 trillion property and casualty insurance industry, and its initial public offering has been expected for the past two years.  JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank are the lead bookrunners, with Citigroup Inc (C.N) among other underwriters, the sources said. Although a specific timeline is uncertain, Guidewire could file with regulators later this year.  Guidewire did not return calls for comment. Spokespeople for the banks declined to comment.  Guidewire’s Java-based, online software addresses the full insurance process, from developing and writing policies, to administering claims on those policies, and billing customers for their premiums.  Its claims-management software is the most popular portion of its suite, based on customer lists on the company’s website.  While most of these customers are small by the standards of property and casualty insurance, Guidewire’s 96 clients include major corporate names such as CNA Financial (CNA.N) and Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRKa.N) auto insurer GEICO, as well as government bodies like the Earthquake Commission of New Zealand and the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association.  The company has not disclosed its revenues, nor the investment amounts made by its venture capital backers Bay Partners, U.S. Venture Partners and Battery Ventures L.P.  Guidewire is among a slew of small but profitable software companies like ServiceNow and Palo Alto Networks that could fetch multiples of five to 10 times revenue when they go public, according to one of the people close to the matter.  That contrasts with the hyper growth potential of social media companies like Groupon, Zynga and Facebook, which could generate multiple in the 20 times revenue range.  “It is a sizable software company, and the lead in that space.

27,BRKa,Buffett unit offers $3.2 billion for Transatlantic,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc made a $3.24 billion buyout offer for Transatlantic Holdings Inc, topping two existing rival bids for the reinsurer.  Transatlantic’s board said on Sunday it would “carefully consider and evaluate” the $52-per-share offer by Berkshire unit National Indemnity Co.  Berkshire has given the reinsurer time until the close of business on Monday, August 8, to make a formal response to the offer.  Transatlantic has an agreement to be bought by Allied World Assurance Company Holdings Ltd in a deal currently worth $44.22 per share, or $2.75 billion.  Validus Holdings Ltd, meanwhile, launched a hostile bid for Transatlantic, with a proposal currently worth $46.36 per share, or $2.89 billion.  Allied World issued a statement on Sunday reaffirming that its combination with Transatlantic is financially superior and strategically beneficial to shareholders.  Validus Holdings also separately issued a statement on Sunday urging the board of directors of Transatlantic to enter into discussions with Validus after receiving the new Buffett proposal.  Today’s news comes just days after Berkshire reported a larger second-quarter profit. On Friday, one analyst said the conglomerate had to find ways to start spending its $47.89 billion cash pile in order to grow.  Buffett, often called the “Oracle of Omaha,” has talked about his desire to make more insurance acquisitions if he could find strong companies with competitive advantages.  “It would appear that given depressed markets they see an opportunity here,” said Michael Yoshikami, president of YCMNET Advisers, a California wealth manager and Berkshire shareholder.  “Given the short time frame, Transatlantic has been given to respond, they are looking to press this on a short time frame; I don’t sense a bidding war here,” Yoshikami said.  Buffett’s bid values Transatlantic’s shares at $52 apiece, a 15 percent premium to Friday’s closing price of $45.24 on the New York Stock Exchange.  On Sunday, Transatlantic’s board backed its recommendation of the agreement with Allied World and advised shareholders to await the board’s decision regarding the Buffett proposal before taking any action.  Goldman, Sachs & Co and Moelis & Co LLC are acting as financial advisers and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP is acting as legal counsel to Transatlantic.  Allied World and Validus have been canvassing shareholders to drum up support for their proposals.  Allied World has been making the case that its deal with Transatlantic would save money and create a company with a better risk profile, two sources told Reuters last month.  It says Transatlantic shareholders also would get a specialty insurance business with their plan, while the company would double down on reinsurance in the rival offer.  Validus has argued that its offer was still worth more than Allied World’s, a third source told Reuters in July.  It was also raising questions about the industrial logic of the rival deal, arguing that Allied World’s specialty insurance business competes with many reinsurance clients of Transatlantic, according to the source.

28,BRKa,UPDATE 4-Buffett unit offers $3.2 bln for Transatlantic," * Berkshire unit offers to buy Transatlantic for $52/shr   * Buffett’s bid tops two rival offers for Transatlantic  (Adds Allied World, Validus reactions)   By Ben Berkowitz and Dhanya Skariachan   NEW YORK, Aug 7 (Reuters) - A unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) made a $3.24 billion buyout offer for Transatlantic Holdings Inc TRH.N, topping two existing rival bids for the reinsurer.   Transatlantic’s board said on Sunday it would “carefully consider and evaluate” the $52-per-share offer by Berkshire unit National Indemnity Co.   Berkshire has given the reinsurer time until the close of business on Monday, Aug. 8, to make a formal response to the offer.   Transatlantic has an agreement to be bought by Allied World Assurance Company Holdings Ltd AWH.N in a deal currently worth $44.22 per share, or $2.75 billion.   Validus Holdings Ltd (VR.N), meanwhile, launched a hostile bid for Transatlantic, with a proposal currently worth $46.36 per share, or $2.89 billion.   Allied World issued a statement on Sunday reaffirming that its combination with Transatlantic is financially superior and strategically beneficial to shareholders.   Validus Holdings also separately issued a statement on Sunday urging the board of directors of Transatlantic to enter into discussions with Validus after receiving the new Buffett proposal.   Today’s news comes just days after Berkshire reported a larger second-quarter profit. On Friday, one analyst said the conglomerate had to find ways to start spending its $47.89 billion cash pile in order to grow. [ID:nN1E7730V6]   Buffett, often called the “Oracle of Omaha,” has talked about his desire to make more insurance acquisitions if he could find strong companies with competitive advantages.   “It would appear that given depressed markets they see an opportunity here,” said Michael Yoshikami, president of YCMNET Advisers, a California wealth manager and Berkshire shareholder.   “Given the short time frame, Transatlantic has been given to respond, they are looking to press this on a short time frame; I don’t sense a bidding war here,” Yoshikami said.    Buffett’s bid values Transatlantic’s shares at $52 apiece, a 15 percent premium to Friday’s closing price of $45.24 on the New York Stock Exchange.   On Sunday, Transatlantic’s board backed its recommendation of the agreement with Allied World and advised shareholders to await the board’s decision regarding the Buffett proposal before taking any action.   Goldman, Sachs & Co and Moelis & Co LLC are acting as financial advisers and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP is acting as legal counsel to Transatlantic.   Allied World and Validus have been canvassing shareholders to drum up support for their proposals.   Allied World has been making the case that its deal with Transatlantic would save money and create a company with a better risk profile, two sources told Reuters last month.   It says Transatlantic shareholders also would get a specialty insurance business with their plan, while the company would double down on reinsurance in the rival offer.   Validus has argued that its offer was still worth more than Allied World’s, a third source told Reuters in July.   It was also raising questions about the industrial logic of the rival deal, arguing that Allied World’s specialty insurance business competes with many reinsurance clients of Transatlantic, according to the source.   Validus is digging in for a long battle, as it did two years ago when it won a months-long bidding war for Bermuda reinsurance rival IPC, the source said.

29,BRKa,WRAPUP 2-S&P; cuts ratings tied to US sovereign credit," * S&P cuts ratings of clearing and depository institutions   * Downgrades include insurers, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae   * Muni prices level to firmer awaiting S&P guidance   (Recasts, adds comments, paragraphs: 3, 7, 20-21)   By Joan Gralla   NEW YORK, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Credit ratings on some of the main arteries of the U.S. financial system — from clearing houses to government mortgage agencies — were cut one notch to AA-plus by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services on Monday.   S&P said the downgrades, which also hit big insurers, were due to its lowering of the U.S. sovereign credit rating late on Friday. That decision prompted the agency to review ratings of a host of entities whose financial health depends heavily on the federal government.   S&P based its decision on its view the U.S. Congress and President Barack Obama have not done enough to shrink the budget deficit and rising debt burden. A Senate panel responded by launching a probe of the downgrade. See: [ID:nN1E7771XF].   Prices of Treasuries held their gains while the U.S. stock market’s dive accelerated after President Barack Obama said he hopes S&P’s downgrade gives lawmakers a new sense of urgency to tackle long-term deficit spending.   Corporate bond issuance ground to a halt. Even Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), the heavyweight insurer run by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, was swept up in the wholesale credit revisions. S&P affirmed its AA-plus rating but cut the company’s outlook to negative.   Four of Berkshire’s peers suffered the same fate: Assured Guaranty (AGO.N), Guardian, Massachusetts Mutual, and Western & Southern [WESTE.UL]. Five U.S. insurance groups were cut by one notch to AA-plus: Knights of Columbus, New York Life, Northwestern Mutual, Teachers Insurance & Annuity Association of America and United Services Automobile Association.   U.S. bank stocks were among the biggest losers though S&P said the country’s downgrade had no immediate or direct impact on its bank ratings.   The U.S. municipal market got little guidance from S&P, which so far has only cut to AA-plus the ratings of some defeased industrial revenue bonds and debt backed by federal leases. Public housing debt is expected to be cut if it has federal guarantees.   The credit agency currently rates 13 states at AAA and is reviewing the impact of the country’s debt consolidation plan on the budgets of states and municipalities, said David Beers, who leads the agency’s sovereign ratings group.   Muni bond yields closed unchanged to three basis points lower, keeping a tight grip on last week’s stunning rally, which clipped yields of some top quality tax-free bonds as much as 40 basis points. [ID:nN1E7770SM]   The ratings of four institutions that clear and process trades and are crucial to the daily workings of the U.S. financial markets were cut to AA-plus from AAA.   The firms, whose behind-the-scenes work is vital, are: the Depository Trust Co, National Securities Clearing Corp, Fixed Income Clearing Corp and the Options Clearing Corp.   Wayne Luthringshausen, chairman of the OCC, said: “This rating change will have no impact on OCC’s operations or our ability to meet our obligations to OCC’s clearing members.”   However, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) warned: “Because of the unprecedented nature of negative credit rating actions with respect to U.S. government obligations, the ultimate impacts on global markets and our business, financial condition and liquidity are unpredictable and may not be immediately apparent.” For details, see: [ID:nN1E77706W].   S&P — the only one of three major rating agencies to cut the U.S. rating from the highest rank — said the downgrade constrains the clearing and depository institutions because “their respective businesses and the assets they hold are concentrated in the domestic market.   “We have not changed our view of the fundamental soundness of their depository or clearing operations,” it said.   Giving the four clearing firms negative outlooks, S&P cited the macro-economy and long-term stability of U.S. markets.   S&P also cut ratings on 73 funds sponsored by banks, states, counties, and cities by as much as two notches because of their direct or indirect investments in Treasuries and U.S. government agency securities.   The list included funds from BlackRock Fund Advisors (BLK.N), Federated Investors (FII.N), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and State Street (STT.N). Illinois, Georgia, Florida’s Palm Beach County and Los Angeles also made the list.   As expected, S&P cut by one notch to AA-plus the ratings of Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB, the two government-sponsored enterprises that are central to the U.S. residential mortgage market.   Fannie Mae stressed the huge uncertainty S&P injected into global markets. “We cannot predict the ultimate impact of the S&P downgrade on our access to or cost of debt funding, or on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition or net worth.” Freddie Mac had no comment.   The Federal Home Loan Banks were also cut to AA-plus.

33,BRKa,Top insurers plunge amid market rout,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of the largest U.S. insurers plunged on Monday, with some of the top names losing more than 10 percent, as the Standard & Poor’s downgrade of the United States’ credit rating rippled through the markets.  The S&P insurance index .GSPINSC fell 6.5 percent to its lowest level in two years. Every stock in the index was down, and only two — conglomerates Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) and Loews Corp (L.N) — were down less than 5 percent.  The declines came amid a broad market plunge that saw the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI drop 500 points and the S&P 500 index .SPX lose more than 6 percent at one point.  The largest decliner in both the insurance index and the S&P 500 was mortgage and life insurer Genworth Financial (GNW.N), down 20.9 percent at $5.36 in afternoon trading.  Genworth has been under severe pressure of late as mortgage insurers report deteriorating market conditions that threaten their ability to survive. Genworth, which has said it may split in two, has lost half of its value in the last five weeks.  Other leading decliners included Hartford Financial (HIG.N), down 13 percent; AIG (AIG.N), down 11.1 percent; and MetLife (MET.N), 8.4 percent lower.  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners said early Monday the U.S. debt downgrade would not have any impact on insurance companies from a regulatory standpoint, easing fears they might be caught short of capital requirements by not having enough AAA-rated investments on their books.  However, analysts say it could matter from a valuation perspective, particularly if the price of U.S. debt falls and hurts the book value of insurance companies, which hold huge piles of U.S. Treasury securities.  “Since most property-casualty insurers trade on book value, the property-casualty stocks would thus also likely fall. Some investors continue to value life insurers on book value, so the life insurance stocks would probably fall as well,” analysts at Sandler O’Neill said in a research note.

34,BRKa,Transatlantic shares rise after Berkshire bid,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings TRH.N rose more than 8 percent on Monday despite broad and deep market declines, after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) made an unsolicited offer over the weekend to buy the company.  Transatlantic shares rose to $48.92 in morning trading, far outstripping a 1.1 percent decline in S&P insurance shares.  The company now has three suitors — Berkshire, its agreed buyer Allied World AWH.N and hostile candidate Validus (VR.N). Transatlantic and Allied reached a deal in mid-June, which Validus attempted to trump in July with an offer it has now taken to shareholders.  At the share prices shortly after the markets opened Monday, the Allied World bid was a 7 percent discount to Transatlantic’s share price, while the Validus offer is a 4 percent discount and the Berkshire offer is a 6.2 percent premium.  All three deals value Transatlantic at less than book value. Transatlantic currently trades at 0.72 times its book value, compared to a sector average of 0.74, according to Thomson Reuters data.

35,BRKa,Transatlantic reminds why Wall Street likes reinsurance,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s entry into the bidding for Transatlantic Holdings TRH.N is drawing fresh attention to the reinsurance industry, which specializes in writing insurance for insurers in a way that frees up those companies to take on more risk.  With cheap valuations and the potential for quick returns and lucrative fees, it is little wonder that Wall Street has always liked the reinsurance business.  From hubs in Bermuda, London, Switzerland and Germany, the largest reinsurers collectively write more than $100 billion a year in new premiums, and as long as major disasters don’t sap their capital, they hum along as steadily as anything else in the financial sector.  “Within the overall financial services sector you have one of the most attractive valuations, and you have a catalyst that is somewhat separate from some of the macro issues out there,” said Cathy Seifert, an insurance equity analyst at Standard & Poor’s who covers many of the Bermudan players. “The financial sector is sort of not an in-favor sector right now but in that sector these stocks look attractive.”  While shares in investment banks and brokers trade at a multiple of 1.34 times their book value, for example, reinsurers trade at closer to 0.74 times book in the current market, according to Thomson Reuters data.  That in and of itself makes the business attractive to the likes of Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) entered the fray for Transatlantic last weekend with an offer that values the company at less than 0.8 times book.  As one financial services banker put it, Buffett could buy Transatlantic, shut it down and still make money on it as its already written book of business runs off over time.  If he succeeds, the Transatlantic deal could vault the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group into the No. 3 slot globally behind European titans Munich Re (MUVGn.DE) and Swiss Re RUKN.VX.  “Predictability is difficult in this business, but at the end of the day Buffett likes insurance businesses because he gets to put float to work,” said Tom Lewandowski, financial services analyst at Edward Jones, referring to the cash pile insurers hold and invest while waiting to pay claims.  Whichever way Transatlantic answers, no one expects Berkshire to get into a three-way fight over price with the other two potential buyers.  “I don’t think Berkshire will be in a bidding war. I think they made an offer and that’ll be that,” said Steve Check, president of Check Capital Management in Costa Mesa, California, whose largest shareholding is in Berkshire.  Putting the float to work, as Buffett may aspire to do with Transatlantic, is one of the factors that has drawn Wall Street to the reinsurance business in past.  Transatlantic suitors Allied World AWH.N and Validus Holdings (VR.N) were both co-founded by affiliates of Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N), in 2001 and 2005, respectively.  Each is part of a disaster “class,” a group of reinsurers founded after a major capital-absorbing event like the 9/11 attacks or Hurricane Katrina. When a disaster like one of those events suddenly takes up tens of billions of dollars of reinsurance capital, companies rush in to take advantage of the subsequent increase in insurance pricing.  In fact, according to a 2008 economic analysis of the Bermudan insurance market by the Wharton School, at least four of the 11 insurers from the “class of 2005” had investment banks or top-tier private equity firms as lead investors. The same was true for at least three of the 10 firms from the 2001 class and four of the nine firms from the 1993 class.  In some cases, those Wall Street sponsors have started a company and then cashed out with an initial public offering or a trade sale as quickly as they could. In other cases, they have kept a significant stake in the business and maintained a banking relationship with the company.  Some of that has to do with what the insurance industry refers to as “long-tail risk” versus “short-tail risk” — in other words, how quickly the insurer is likely to see claims for coverage from insureds.  Long-tail risk, where claims may come in years after the fact, would include things like medical malpractice coverage and worker’s compensation policies. Short-tail risk, on the other hand, is the reinsurance people think of more typically, such as hurricane coverage.  The financial services banker said Wall Street firms like short-tail reinsurers for their ability to start them and sell them quickly, but they also like long-tail reinsurers because they can obtain deals to manage the float for those insurance companies and be paid fees as a result.  Given the attraction, there has been speculation in the industry that 2011 could eventually host its own disaster class. Insurers and reinsurers have lost more than $60 billion this year on natural disasters like the Japanese and New Zealand earthquakes and U.S. tornadoes.  That has not been enough to cause a so-called “hard market,” where insurers can raise prices across the board, but it has come close.

36,BRKa,Transatlantic reminds why Wall St likes reinsurance," * Analysts point to sharp discount to book value   * Big banks backed at least a third of recent start-ups   * Bidding war for Transatlantic proves value   By Ben Berkowitz   NEW YORK, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s entry into the bidding for Transatlantic Holdings TRH.N is drawing fresh attention to the reinsurance industry, which specializes in writing insurance for insurers in a way that frees up those companies to take on more risk.   With cheap valuations and the potential for quick returns and lucrative fees, it is little wonder that Wall Street has always liked the reinsurance business.   From hubs in Bermuda, London, Switzerland and Germany, the largest reinsurers collectively write more than $100 billion a year in new premiums, and as long as major disasters don’t sap their capital, they hum along as steadily as anything else in the financial sector.   “Within the overall financial services sector you have one of the most attractive valuations, and you have a catalyst that is somewhat separate from some of the macro issues out there,” said Cathy Seifert, an insurance equity analyst at Standard & Poor’s who covers many of the Bermudan players. “The financial sector is sort of not an in-favor sector right now but in that sector these stocks look attractive.”   While shares in investment banks and brokers trade at a multiple of 1.34 times their book value, for example, reinsurers trade at closer to 0.74 times book in the current market, according to Thomson Reuters data.   That in and of itself makes the business attractive to the likes of Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) entered the fray for Transatlantic last weekend with an offer that values the company at less than 0.8 times book.   As one financial services banker put it, Buffett could buy Transatlantic, shut it down and still make money on it as its already written book of business runs off over time.   If he succeeds, the Transatlantic deal could vault the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group into the No. 3 slot globally behind European titans Munich Re (MUVGn.DE) and Swiss Re RUKN.VX.   “Predictability is difficult in this business, but at the end of the day Buffett likes insurance businesses because he gets to put float to work,” said Tom Lewandowski, financial services analyst at Edward Jones, referring to the cash pile insurers hold and invest while waiting to pay claims.   Whichever way Transatlantic answers, no one expects Berkshire to get into a three-way fight over price with the other two potential buyers.   “I don’t think Berkshire will be in a bidding war. I think they made an offer and that’ll be that,” said Steve Check, president of Check Capital Management in Costa Mesa, California, whose largest shareholding is in Berkshire.   Putting the float to work, as Buffett may aspire to do with Transatlantic, is one of the factors that has drawn Wall Street to the reinsurance business in past.   Transatlantic suitors Allied World AWH.N and Validus Holdings (VR.N) were both co-founded by affiliates of Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N), in 2001 and 2005, respectively.   Each is part of a disaster “class,” a group of reinsurers founded after a major capital-absorbing event like the 9/11 attacks or Hurricane Katrina. When a disaster like one of those events suddenly takes up tens of billions of dollars of reinsurance capital, companies rush in to take advantage of the subsequent increase in insurance pricing.   In fact, according to a 2008 economic analysis of the Bermudan insurance market by the Wharton School, at least four of the 11 insurers from the “class of 2005” had investment banks or top-tier private equity firms as lead investors. The same was true for at least three of the 10 firms from the 2001 class and four of the nine firms from the 1993 class.   In some cases, those Wall Street sponsors have started a company and then cashed out with an initial public offering or a trade sale as quickly as they could. In other cases, they have kept a significant stake in the business and maintained a banking relationship with the company.   Some of that has to do with what the insurance industry refers to as “long-tail risk” versus “short-tail risk” — in other words, how quickly the insurer is likely to see claims for coverage from insureds.   Long-tail risk, where claims may come in years after the fact, would include things like medical malpractice coverage and worker’s compensation policies. Short-tail risk, on the other hand, is the reinsurance people think of more typically, such as hurricane coverage.   The financial services banker said Wall Street firms like short-tail reinsurers for their ability to start them and sell them quickly, but they also like long-tail reinsurers because they can obtain deals to manage the float for those insurance companies and be paid fees as a result.   Given the attraction, there has been speculation in the industry that 2011 could eventually host its own disaster class. Insurers and reinsurers have lost more than $60 billion this year on natural disasters like the Japanese and New Zealand earthquakes and U.S. tornadoes.   That has not been enough to cause a so-called “hard market,” where insurers can raise prices across the board, but it has come close. Given that the worst of hurricane season is just starting, many believe a single U.S. landfall of a major hurricane would be enough to force that market turn.   If so, capital could rush in quickly; in 2005, for example, some of the new reinsurers were formed within two months or so of Katrina devastating New Orleans.   “It’s not 2001, and it’s not 2005 but slowly and gradually, it is a catalyst, and it is a catalyst that is bearing down on a group that is trading below their tangible book value,” S&P’s Seifert said.

37,BRKa,S&P;: Berkshire outlook to negative amid broad move,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Standard & Poor’s cut its ratings outlook on Warren Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway to “negative” from “stable” on Monday, part of a broad action on 10 insurers linked to last Friday’s downgrade of the United States credit rating.  S&P downgraded five insurers to “AA+” from “AAA,” as it had warned it would do: Knights of Columbus, New York Life, Northwestern Mutual, TIAA and USAA.  But it also unexpectedly revised the ratings outlook on five insurers already rated “AA+” to “negative” from “stable,” among them Berkshire and bond insurer Assured Guaranty.  The agency made clear that the move was wholly linked to last Friday’s action, and it warned that if the United States were downgraded again, the insurers likely would be as well.  “Our view of these companies’ fundamental credit characteristics has not changed,” S&P said. “Rather, the rating actions reflect the application of criteria and our view that the link between the ratings on these entities and the sovereign credit ratings on the U.S. could lead to a decline in the insurers’ financial strength.”  For Berkshire, the move affects a variety of its insurance businesses, including auto insurer Geico and reinsurance business General Re.  One Berkshire investor immediately questioned the agency’s logic but also played down the impact.  “I don’t think it matters much to Berkshire and I don’t think it makes much sense,” said Steve Check, president of Check Capital Management in Costa Mesa, California.

38,BRKa,Insurance shares rally on valuation calls,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Insurance shares rallied sharply on Tuesday, after having their worst day in 28 months Monday, as a number of analysts said valuations had become too attractive to ignore.  The S&P insurance index .GSPINSC rose 3.7 percent in early trading, with all 22 index components higher. On Monday, the index fell 8.1 percent — its biggest drop since April 2009 — with all 22 components down roughly 6 percent or more.  Both Monday’s plunge and Tuesday’s bounce reflected the broader markets, which had one of their worst days ever before rebounding.  Barclays Capital upgraded Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), Progressive Corp (PGR.N) and Chubb Corp (CB.N) to “overweight” from “equal weight,” citing their valuations and strong position relative to the rest of the property and casualty insurance industry.  Bernstein Research was just as positive on life insurers, saying circumstances were different now than in late 2007, with better liquidity and a better market understanding of the companies’ interest rate risks. The firm said it prefers MetLife (MET.N), Prudential Financial (PRU.N) and Ameriprise Financial (AMP.N).  The recent plunge comes as insurers languish at historically low valuations. Many insurers are trading at or slightly below book value, whereas in good times many may trade at twice that.

43,BRKa,"Transatlantic bids tighten, Buffett watch still on","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The spread between two of the dueling offers for reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings TRH.N virtually disappeared on Wednesday amid a fresh market rout, as deal-watchers waited for any sign as to what late entrant Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) might do next.  As of 12:20 p.m. ET, the gap between Transatlantic’s accepted offer from Allied World AWH.N and its hostile offer from Validus Holdings (VR.N) was about $70,000 in Allied’s favor. At one point, Validus’s mid-July bid was nearly $400 million better than the Allied offer, which Transatlantic accepted in June.  At the time each was made, the Allied World offer was worth $3.2 billion and the Validus offer was worth $3.5 billion.  Validus has lost more than a fifth of its value over the last month since making its bid, which has narrowed the spread substantially. Both bids remain at a sharp discount to Transatlantic’s share price and book value, though.  On the other hand, the surprise $52-a-share offer from Warren Buffett’s National Indemnity unit still stands at a premium. One analyst following Transatlantic said Berkshire stood a good chance of winning just on that premium alone.  “I look at it and have a hard time seeing how it doesn’t go to Warren at some point,” said Larry Greenberg, an insurance analyst at Janney Capital Markets unit Langen McAlenney.  “It probably comes down to price. We don’t know if Warren’s price was cash, they left that ambiguous. I think for some shareholders that is a consideration in being able to participate in any potential upside, but given the spread between Warren’s offer and what the others suggest at this point, and looking at where Transatlantic is trading, I kind of think it comes down to economics.”  There are many who agree with his logic, though there are just as many who doubt Validus or Allied World will give up without a fight.  Stifel Nicolaus, in a research note Monday, said Berkshire’s entry helped prove the merit of Validus’s bid, and that Validus could easily raise its bid without spending more by cutting the amount it plans to infuse into Transatlantic’s reserves after closing.  Transatlantic said Monday night that it would stick with the Allied bid but that National Indemnity’s offer could lead to a superior proposal — the same language it once used with Validus, before the sides failed to agree on confidentiality terms and Validus went to shareholders.  Berkshire has not given any reaction yet to Transatlantic’s offer to hold confidential talks. Berkshire investors, however, doubt that the company has any interest in a bidding war and have said it is likely being opportunistic with a “take-it-or-leave-it” offer well below book value.  With the values getting close, though, sources close to Allied World are hoping it would lead to shareholders picking their deal over the rivals.  “They are better off doing a transaction than not doing a transaction. ‘I am getting synergies, the benefits of a global non-U.S. domiciled reinsurer, and I am getting my fair share of book value per share split,’” a source close to Allied World said, referring to Transatlantic shareholders.  “At the end of the day, between doing no deal or something to that nature, I think they will choose to do something,” the source said.  Validus, on the other hand, said Allied was the wrong long-term choice for a number of reasons, including its growth strategy in the U.S. casualty market.  “We continue to believe that our proposal offers superior value and greater potential for future upside to Transatlantic stockholders,” a Validus spokeswoman said.  Shares in Transatlantic fell 2.5 percent to $49.48, shares in Allied were off 1.1 percent at $52.27 and Validus shares declined 2.2 percent to $24.43.

The dual moves were designed to raise the pressure on Transatlantic, which has stuck with a deal with Allied World Assurance Co Holdings Ltd AWH.N despite subsequent larger offers from Validus and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N).  Validus’ Delaware suit against Transatlantic, its board and Allied World is designed to stop the Allied deal until Validus can enter into talks with Transatlantic, in part through a declaration that Validus does not need to sign a standstill agreement as a condition of those talks.  Such an agreement would keep Validus from pursuing a hostile bid or opposing the Allied World deal in the event talks were unsuccessful.  The 61-page suit was full of blunt language, as when Validus asked the court “to compel the (defendants) to fulfill their fiduciary duties to Transatlantic’s stockholders and stop burying their heads in the sand.”  Validus went on to allege that Transatlantic’s directors had only limited shareholdings in the company and were acting solely to guarantee themselves better-paying jobs on a combined TransAllied board.  A Transatlantic spokesman could not immediately comment.  In a filing with securities regulators, Validus also disclosed a letter it sent to Transatlantic management on Wednesday, offering the company a chance to review Validus’ books without Transatlantic opening its own books in return.  The review of information has been a major sticking point in the deal. Transatlantic agreed to a deal in June with Allied World, but determined in July that Validus’ unsolicited bid could lead to a superior offer.  At that time, Transatlantic asked Validus to sign a confidentiality agreement that included a standstill provision. Validus refused to sign the agreement and took its bid directly to shareholders.  Transatlantic subsequently sued Validus for allegedly misleading shareholders.

47,BRKa,Warren Buffett buying in down market,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett has been buying amid this week’s sharp declines in the market, and has not yet seen anything that suggests another downturn is emerging, the legendary investor told Fortune magazine.  In an interview published on Thursday, Buffett also told the magazine he understood why Standard & Poor’s lowered its outlook on the credit rating of his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, but said he disagreed with the underlying premise - the downgrade of the United States’ credit rating.  The 80-year-old “Oracle of Omaha” is known for his love of a good deal, which is why his company made an unsolicited offer below book value for reinsurance company Transatlantic Holdings last weekend, and why Berkshire sold $2 billion of senior unsecured notes this week at historically low rates.

51,BRKa,Transatlantic opens buyout talks with Berkshire unit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Transatlantic Holdings Inc opened talks with a unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Friday over a $3.2 billion takeover offer, adding a new twist in the battle for the reinsurer.  The Berkshire unit, National Indemnity, entered into a confidentiality agreement with Transatlantic, according to Transatlantic.  Transatlantic already has an all-stock $2.9 billion deal to merge with Allied World Assurance Company Holdings Ltd.  It is also facing a hostile $2.9 billion cash-and-stock takeover offer from Validus Holdings Ltd.  Friday’s move could force these other Transatlantic suitors to sweeten their bids, and possibly unleash a bidding war for the New York-based reinsurance company.  Allied World and Validus have both seen the value of their bids fall, thanks to the stock in the purchase price.  The Validus bid, which at one point was nearly $400 million better than the Allied offer, has lost all its premium, thanks to adverse investor reaction to its bid and broader market turmoil.  Transatlantic first entered into a deal with Allied World in June, but its plans hit a hurdle when a month later Validus came in with an offer of its own.  At the time each was made, the Allied World offer was worth $3.2 billion and the Validus offer was worth $3.5 billion.  Earlier this month, as the values of Allied World’s offer fell, Buffett’s lieutenant Ajit Jain jumped in with its $3.2 billion cash bid.  Transatlantic rejected Berkshire’s offer as too low but said the bid could lead to a superior proposal, and offered to open talks if Berkshire signed a confidentiality agreement.  Transatlantic said on Friday the terms of the confidentiality agreement with National Indemnity are substantially similar to the terms of the agreement it entered into with Allied World.  Notably, the agreement includes a standstill provision, which had become a point of contention with Validus and led the Bermuda reinsurer to take its bid directly to Transatlantic’s shareholders.  Validus sued Transatlantic on Thursday, but also offered its own books for review in an effort to raise pressure on Transatlantic to open talks with it.

54,BRKa,Buffett higher tax call strikes a nerve,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett has touched a national nerve.  The 80-year-old “Oracle of Omaha,” one of the world’s three richest men, has taken to the pages of the New York Times to call for higher taxes — yes, higher taxes — for himself and his well-off peers.  “My friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress. It’s time for our government to get serious about shared sacrifice,” he said.  Buffett calling for a higher tax burden for the wealthy is nothing new; last November, in a lengthy sit-down interview with ABC News, he insisted that the wealthy “have it better than we’ve ever had it” and that they had an obligation to pay substantially more tax.  However, the timing of his latest appeal made people take notice. Washington lawmakers are fighting about how to reduce the nation’s budget deficit and curb its massive debt burden, and the question of “added revenue” — code for higher taxes — looms larger than any other.  Republicans have fiercely resisted any attempts by President Barack Obama and Democrats in Congress to make higher taxes for the wealthy part of any budget plan, insisting instead on all the deficit-curbing measures be made through spending cuts.  Taxation will be a major theme of the 2012 presidential election, and Buffett planted himself squarely in the middle of the debate.  “While the poor and middle class fight for us in Afghanistan, and while most Americans struggle to make ends meet, we mega-rich continue to get our extraordinary tax breaks,” he wrote.  Buffett is not alone in agitating for change.  Starbucks Corp Chief Executive Howard Schultz is brewing up support for his call to withhold political contributions to U.S. lawmakers until they strike a “fair, bipartisan” deal on the country’s debt, revenue and spending.  In his Times piece, Buffett felt free to speak for his fellow rich.  “Most wouldn’t mind being told to pay more in taxes as well, particularly when so many of their fellow citizens are truly suffering,” he said.  While there are plenty of “super-rich” who have been outspoken on tax issues in past, like Carlyle Group co-founder David Rubenstein and Congressman Darrell Issa, only one of the country’s notably wealthy people who was contacted by Reuters was immediately willing to respond to Buffett’s call.  “George Soros says he agrees and congratulates Warren Buffett,” his spokesman said. “The rich are hurting their own long term interests by their opposition to paying more taxes.”  From the general taxpaying public, the reaction was almost instantaneous. “Warren Buffett” was one of the single most mentioned topics on Twitter as of Monday afternoon, as was the title of his op-ed piece, “Stop Coddling the Super-Rich.” Nearly 55,000 people voted in an MSNBC.com poll on his comments, and 95 percent agreed with him.  President Obama, appearing in Minnesota on a bus tour of the U.S. Midwest, cited Buffett’s comments as further proof that Congress needed to find ways to raise tax revenue without taxing the middle class any further.  Speaking of the various tax incentives he and other wealthy taxpayers receive, Buffett said “(these) and other blessings are showered upon us by legislators in Washington who feel compelled to protect us, much as if we were spotted owls or some other endangered species. It’s nice to have friends in high places.”  Buffett, chairman of the conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, said his federal tax bill last year was $6,938,744, the equivalent of 64 shares of Berkshire Class A stock.  “That sounds like a lot of money. But what I paid was only 17.4 percent of my taxable income — and that’s actually a lower percentage than was paid by any of the other 20 people in our office. Their tax burdens ranged from 33 percent to 41 percent and averaged 36 percent,” he said.

56,BRKa,Obama says Warren Buffett is right about taxes,"CANNON FALLS, Minnesota (Reuters) - Small-town Americans probably don’t make as much money as Warren Buffett, but they pay more of their income in taxes, President Barack Obama said on Monday, citing the billionaire investor to argue that the government needs more revenues to balance the budget.  Obama referred to an opinion column written by the Berkshire Hathaway Inc chairman as he made the case to about 500 people at a town hall meeting in rural Minnesota that any attempt to close the U.S. deficit gap should include tax increases for the rich as well as spending cuts.  Cannon Falls was the first stop on Obama’s three-state bus tour through middle America intended to connect with voters as he embarks on his 2012 re-election campaign.  He is expected to focus on jobs and the economy after a bitter debate in Washington over debt and deficits that triggered a downgrade in the U.S. credit rating.  “I put a deal before the Speaker of the House, John Boehner, that would have solved this problem.  “And he walked away because his belief was we can’t ask anything of millionaires and billionaires and big corporations in order to close our deficit,” Obama said, referring to the divisive fight with congressional Republicans over how best to deal with the country’s massive budget deficit.  In a column headlined “Stop Coddling the Super-Rich,” Buffett wrote in The New York Times on Monday that he paid $6,938,744 in income tax last year, only 17.4 percent of his taxable income.  “That’s actually a lower percentage than was paid by any of the other 20 people in our office,” Buffett wrote. “Their tax burdens ranged from 33 percent to 41 percent and averaged 36 percent.”  Buffett urged members of a new congressional “supercommittee” looking at ways to balance the budget to raise rates immediately on taxable income in excess of $1 million, and even more for those making more than $10 million.  “My friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress,” Buffett wrote. “It’s time for our government to get serious about shared sacrifice.”  Congressional Republicans — and Republican candidates vying for the party’s nomination to run against Obama next year — oppose any increase in taxes. Obama wants taxes to be increased for the wealthiest Americans.  “You don’t get those tax breaks. You’re paying more than that. Now I may be wrong, but I think you’re a little less wealthy than Warren Buffett. Now that’s just a guess,” Obama said, to laughter from his Minnesota audience.

59,BRKa,Transatlantic rises as Berkshire talks start,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings Inc TRH.N hit their highest level in nearly two weeks on Monday after the company said it would open talks with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on an unsolicited buyout offer.  Transatlantic shares rose 2 percent to $51.13 in morning trading, drawing closer to Berkshire’s $52-a-share offer. It is not known whether that offer is in cash, stock or both, though most investors and analysts assume it is in cash.  Transatlantic said Friday night it would enter into confidential talks with Berkshire’s National Indemnity, further complicating what was already a highly involved deal.  In June Allied World Assurance Co Holdings Ltd AWH.N and Transatlantic agreed on an all-stock deal that is now worth $2.96 billion. A month later, Validus Holdings Ltd (VR.N) made its own unsolicited cash-and-stock offer, also worth $2.96 billion at Monday’s prices.  In the meantime, Transatlantic and Validus have sued each other, some Transatlantic shareholders have sued as well, and the largest shareholder in Transatlantic has said he may oppose the Allied World deal.  One analyst said Monday the transaction could get more complicated still.  “We expect talks with Berkshire to progress, but would not rule out additional overtures from other parties,” Standard & Poor’s equity analyst Cathy Seifert said in a research note Monday.  Validus has argued that its offer gives Transatlantic shareholders the most upside of the three deals, since it includes a stock component. Allied World has relied on the synergies it says it will gain with a merger and a criticism of Validus’s plan to boost Transatlantic’s reserves.  While Berkshire has said next to nothing publicly about its own offer, its selling point seems to be price, since only its offer remains at a premium to Transatlantic’s shares.

61,BRKa,Judge denies Rajaratnam's bid to toss conviction,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam has lost a bid to have his conviction thrown out after he was found guilty on insider trading charges in May.  U.S. District Court Judge Richard Holwell on Tuesday denied Rajaratnam’s renewed attempt for a judgment of acquittal on his conviction by a Manhattan federal jury on five counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and nine counts of securities fraud.  The one-time billionaire was at the center of the government’s biggest insider trading investigation in decades that has resulted in charges against 50 individuals.  A spokeswoman for Rajaratnam’s defense team had no comment on the ruling.  Lawyers for Rajaratnam challenged the sufficiency of the evidence presented at trial against him. For example, they argued that prosecutors had not provided enough proof that Rajaratnam conspired to trade on the basis of inside tips he received from Rajat Gupta, who was a member of the board of directors of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  At trial, the government presented evidence that Gupta tipped Rajaratnam about Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s agreement to invest $5 billion in Goldman during the financial crisis and the investment bank’s intention to announce losses for the third quarter of 2008.  Holwell ruled that “the jury had evidence several times over to find Rajaratnam guilty beyond a reasonable doubt” on that count.  In a 48-page opinion, Holwell detailed reasons that the other counts should not be thrown out.  Holwell is expected to sentence Rajaratnam on September 27.  Federal prosecutors accused Rajaratnam of trading on inside information from corporate executives, traders, and others, resulting in $63.8 million of illegal profit.  In a court filing last week, prosecutors asked for a sentence of between roughly 19-1/2 and 24-1/2 years, calling Rajaratnam “arguably the most egregious violator” of insider trading laws ever to be caught.  Lawyers for Rajaratnam argued for a sentence “substantially below” what the U.S. guidelines recommend, citing his failing health and his public works.

66,BRKa,UPDATE 1-White House: Vacationing Obama working on economy," * Visiting Detroit on Sept. 5 ahead of jobs speech   * Buffett tax call hit national nerve  (Adds quotes, trip to Detroit.)   By Alister Bull   VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass., Aug 22 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama has taken heat for taking a vacation when the U.S. economy is struggling, but aides are striving to make clear he is not neglecting the country’s finances during his break.   On Monday, Obama met with a top economic adviser and spoke to investor Warren Buffett and Ford Motor Co. (F.N) chief executive Alan Mulally about the economy, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.   Earnest also announced that Obama will travel to Detroit in two weeks to discuss the economy on the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Sept. 5, setting up a major address on jobs he is to deliver later in the month.   The date of that address has not been set.   Obama will spend part of the day with workers and then make remarks to the Metro Detroit Central Labor Council, Earnest said.   With Buffett, the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), Obama discussed the overall U.S. economic outlook and “reaction to the headwinds we’ve experienced over the last couple of months,” Earnest told reporters in Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, where Obama is staying with his family.   “They talked a little bit about some possible measures that would spur investment and increase economic growth. And they also talked about some measures that could address the long-term fiscal situation in this country,” Earnest said.   Some critics from the rival Republican party had questioned whether it was appropriate for Obama to take his annual break given the country’s economic problems, including an unemployment rate stuck above 9 percent and weak growth in the first half of 2011.   TRYING TO JUMP-START THE ECONOMY   Although his schedule includes family outings, golf games and receptions, Obama is expected to spend much of his nine days on the resort island working on a program meant to jump-start the economy and find budget savings that surpass the $1.5 trillion goal of a new congressional deficit-cutting committee.   Buffett, 80, one of the world’s richest men, touched a national nerve last week by taking to the pages of The New York Times to call for higher taxes for himself and his well-off peers.   His call in the Times opinion piece came as Democrats and Republicans fiercely debate how to balance the U.S. budget. Republicans have resisted any attempts by Obama and his fellow Democrats to make higher taxes for wealthier Americans part of a budget plan.   With the Ford executive, Obama discussed developments in the automotive and manufacturing industries, and efforts to work through some temporary disruptions that they experienced earlier this year.   “They also talked a little bit about expanding economic growth, stimulating investment and expanding American exports,” Earnest said.   Aides say he will lay out a package of steps for Congress to consider, including an extension of the payroll tax holiday and unemployment aid, infrastructure investment and patent reform, as well as other proposals that could include extending the payroll tax cut to employers.   Economists are skepitcal that Obama, a Democrat, will be able to muscle anything significant through a divided Congress in which his Republican opponents control the U.S. House of Representatives.

68,BRKa,"Analysis: Rails, not pipes, may tame twisted oil market","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil shipments by railroad could help to end gaping price distortions in world oil markets faster than most traders have been expecting.  Rail shipments of crude from the landlocked and oversupplied Midwest to refiners in the Gulf Coast appear set to surge next year, to nearly double the volume now flowing in congested pipelines between the regions.  The shipments, which were rare until this year, have already grown to around 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) in recent months, industry sources told Reuters. Two rail terminals in St. James, Louisiana are receiving much of the crude, while other sites like Houston are taking additional crude.  The daily cargoes between the Midwest (PADD 2) and the Gulf Coast (PADD 3) could triple to 300,000 bpd by late 2012, industry sources said. Logistics firms unveiled plans for several new crude-by-rail terminals over the last four months.  Since the Department of Energy does not track crude-by-rail, there’s no official data on how much is moving.  But logistics firms say volumes are growing fast, a trend that could slash discounts of $24 a barrel on U.S. oil futures relative to oil in the Gulf Coast or Europe.  Delays in southbound pipeline construction and insufficient existing capacity have resulted in midwestern crude gluts, the main reason cited by oil traders for the unusual discounts. Railroads are emerging as a viable option for inland oil producers to get crude to coastal areas and maximize profits.  “We’re maxed out right now,” said Bill Swann of US Development Corp., referring to his crude-by-rail terminal at St. James that receives around 65,000 barrels per day, mostly from the booming Bakken Shale oilfield in North Dakota.  “We think significant volumes of crude will move by rail for years to come, so we’re building multiple origins and destinations.”  The Texas-based firm is doubling the size of its St. James terminal to receive 130,000 bpd of crude starting in October.  U.S. Development said in June it planned to build five more crude-by-rail terminals by 2013. One on the Texas Gulf Coast could receive Canadian crude, Swann said, while two others could be built on the East and West Coasts.  In futures markets, discounts of at least $18 a barrel on West Texas Intermediate crude delivered at the Cushing, Oklahoma hub persist through the end of 2012, as traders bet that pipeline bottlenecks will perpetuate a supply glut there.  Railroads could allow growing oil supply from Canada’s oil sands and North Dakota to bypass the Midwest.  “While the market frets over what pipeline will be first to bring oil out of the Midwest and into the Gulf Coast, railways are already filling the gap,” JP Morgan oil analysts wrote in a note to clients on Friday.  Crude-by-rail is gaining steam as major pipeline projects fail to get off the ground. Enterprise Products (EPD.N) and Energy Transfer (ETE.N) dropped plans for a 450,000 bpd pipeline between Cushing and Houston last week, citing trouble winning shipper commitments. A second major line, TransCanada’s (TRP.TO) Keystone XL to South Texas, has faced long permitting delays and staunch opposition from environmental groups.  Historically, less than 1 percent of crude has been delivered to U.S. refineries by rail. But with major southbound pipeline projects pushed back to 2013 or beyond, rail shipments are growing despite their higher cost.  It costs around $12 a barrel to ship crude by rail between Bakken and St. James, including loading fees and railcar leases, two industry sources said. The bump in traffic has left few idle tank railcars, and manufacturers are rushing to build hundreds more.  Total U.S. crude and petroleum product shipments by rail hit a record weekly high last month and reached 7,529 carloads last week, or around 780,000 bpd, up 15 percent from year-ago levels, according to the Association of American Railroads.  The trade group’s data doesn’t break out crude from oil products like gasoline, diesel or asphalt, some of which also move by rail.  EOG Resources Inc (EOG.N) and Nustar Energy LP (NS.N) this month said they would expand an existing 20,000 bpd rail terminal in St. James to receive 70,000 bpd by early 2012. EOG says it could double that volume again quickly.  In April, Utah-based Savage Cos. launched plans to build a 70,000 bpd terminal in Port Arthur, Texas, for late 2012. The company is also in talks with refiners on the East and West coasts to ship them Midwestern crude by rail.  “Refineries that import crude are interested in getting it from us by rail,” said Savage manager Jared Larrabee, without naming potential customers due to confidentiality agreements.  Crude-by-rail loading capacity in North Dakota’s Bakken Shale is expected to rise from 130,000 bpd to 500,000 bpd next year, and logistics firms are offering to ship crude almost anywhere tracks can carry it.  Texas-based logistics firm Rangeland Energy struck a deal last month with Tesoro’s TSO.N Anacortes refinery in Washington State to deliver Bakken crude starting in 2012.  Bakken’s growth has turned North Dakota from a tiny oil producer to a 400,000 bpd powerhouse within a few years, and some analysts expect output to hit 1 million bpd by the end of the decade. Meanwhile, crude imports from Canada have grown to around 2 million bpd, doubling since the 1990s.  For decades, the usual flow of U.S. crude has been northbound, from the Gulf Coast states to hubs like Cushing. As southbound flows grow, pipelines are running at full tilt. Some 166,000 bpd moved in pipelines between PADD 2 and PADD 3 in May, or triple the average level in 2009, according to U.S. Department of Energy data. Another 28,000 barrels moved south by barge or truck.  That means rail cargoes could surpass the southbound pipeline volumes next year, and potentially keep the advantage, at least until new lines can be built.  Railroad companies are giddy over the growth prospects. Berkshire Hathaway-owned BNSF railway (BRKa.N) said in February that it could transport 730,000 bpd of Bakken crude as production grows. Competitor Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N) said it could quadruple Bakken-to-Gulf crude-by-rail volumes this year.  The shipments also risk creating new constraints. They have prompted a manufacturing crunch for suitable railcars to ship oil in unit trains, the 100-car configurations that are cheapest and most efficient.  “The growth has been so fast that almost every U.S. railcar with a tank that can ship crude is doing it,” said JP Fjeld-Hansen of logistics firm Musket, which is building a rail terminal in Bakken.  “People want to get it to the Gulf Coast if they can.”  ",8232011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-rail-analysis/analysis-rails-not-pipes-may-tame-twisted-oil-market-idUSTRE77M4MJ20110823
69,BRKa,Insight: Investors say Buffett might go all-in on China's BYD,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett has a Chinese car problem, and he may be tempted to fix it himself — at a cost of billions of dollars.  At the depths of the financial crisis in September 2008, Buffett bought nearly 10 percent of Chinese car and battery maker BYD Co Ltd (002594.SZ) (1211.HK), an investment suggested by his partner Charlie Munger and heartily endorsed by his then-lieutenant David Sokol.  Buffett, despite his self-professed ignorance about BYD’s technology, gave the company his seal of approval. It sparked a huge rally and the stock appreciated tenfold within a year, making his $230 million stake worth $2.47 billion.  Fast-forward two years: BYD’s sales are sinking, its international expansion plans are delayed again, the market is questioning its technology and the stock has lost about 80 percent of its peak value.  Meanwhile, Sokol is gone amid a scandal over his personal investments and the U.S. government has raised questions about BYD’s ability to ever sell outside China because of a pattern of allegedly stolen industrial designs, which BYD has denied.  “Warren Buffett is the greatest investor of all time but sometimes he drinks the Kool-Aid. Not selling BYD, he kind of drank the Kool-Aid on BYD,” said Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management and a Berkshire investor.  Even though Buffett is still up 100 percent on his initial investment, for his Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) conglomerate BYD has become the question that won’t go away.  The solution, Berkshire investors say, may lie with Buffett’s core skill: buying companies cheaply.  “I think he probably will put in more money and if the stock keeps falling I think he will buy the company,” said Michael Yoshikami, founder and chief executive of wealth manager YCMNET Advisors, which oversees $1 billion and holds Berkshire shares. “They’re in the right space and over the long period of time it’s going to be a good international play.”  With a market capitalization of about $8.1 billion, based on Thomson Reuters data, BYD would be well within Buffett’s reach and in line with the size of deal he has talked about doing of late.  Buffett’s assistant did not respond to a request for comment.  If he waits, though, it could get cheaper still. Shares in BYD plummeted more than 14 percent on Tuesday after the company warned it could post a third-quarter loss.  “BYD is run by a guy that Charlie Munger has enormous respect for,” said Steve Check, founder and chief investment officer of Check Capital Management and a Berkshire holder. Check also believes Berkshire would be a buyer of BYD shares rather than a seller in the current circumstances.  “I know Munger is just fascinated with the way the company is run and how hard working the employees are,” Check said via e-mail.  BYD was formed by its Chairman Wang Chuanfu in 1995 with money from a relative and, according to one estimate, by 2009 he had become China’s richest man. Munger once told Fortune magazine Wang was like a combination of Thomas Edison and former General Electric Co CEO Jack Welch.  However, its operations have had their fair share of hiccups of late, given China’s tough auto market. Despite BYD’s F3 sedan being China’s best-selling car brand in 2009 and 2010, the company sold only 480 vehicles combined of its F3DM hybrid and e6 electric model.  It has also delayed the U.S. launch of its e6 until 2012 and warned its net profit for the first three quarters may fall 85 to 95 percent.  Yet despite a long-running trend of sales declines, Munger has continued to firmly endorse the company. In early July, when asked at an investor meeting how long he planned to stick with BYD, Munger said he was in “till the end.” Investors say Buffett may be there with him.  “If Warren Buffett still trusts doing business in China, if he does not believe they’re due for a serious cleansing and difficulty, then he might be very motivated to buy the company while the stock is being pounded aggressively like it is,” Smead said.

In early July, when asked at an investor meeting how long he planned to stick with BYD, Munger said he was in “till the end.” Investors say Buffett may be there with him.   “If Warren Buffett still trusts doing business in China, if he does not believe they’re due for a serious cleansing and difficulty, then he might be very motivated to buy the company while the stock is being pounded aggressively like it is,” Smead said.

71,BRKa,"BYD plummets, puts spotlight on strategy and Buffett","HONG KONG (Reuters) - BYD Co’s profit warning and failure to deliver its promised electric car plan sent shares plunging to a more than two-year low, as the Chinese auto and battery maker backed by Warren Buffett struggles with steady sales declines and waning popularity of its top model.  Shares in BYD plummeted more than 14 percent on Tuesday after the company warned it could post a third-quarter loss.  The grim warning and ensuing stock drop has put a spotlight on the company’s strategy and on Buffett, whose investment in BYD has lost around $2 billion in value since taking a stake in 2009. His stake is still worth twice what he paid, though.  BYD attracted Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway because of its battery technology, which former Berkshire executive David Sokol called a “breakthrough.” Sokol has since left the company under a cloud related to his personal investing activities.  Despite BYD’s F3 sedan being China’s best-selling car brand in 2009 and 2010, the company sold only 480 units combined of its F3DM hybrid and e6 electric model. It has also delayed the U.S. launch of its e6 until 2012.  Sales may improve in the second half with the launch of new models, BYD Chairman Wang Chuanfu said on Tuesday.  The company planned to export electric cars and buses to the United States and Europe next year and other overseas markets such as Hong Kong as early as 2011, the chairman said.  “We will start selling e6 to individual customers in China in the second half and to overseas markets next year,” Wang told reporters. “The fourth quarter is the traditional high season for car sales in China and with the new models coming to the market, our auto sales should be better in the second half than the first half.”  He expects BYD’s gross profit margin, which fell to 13.7 percent in the first half, to improve in the second half.  BYD warned Monday its net profit for the first three quarters may fall 85-95 percent due to fierce competition in China, the world’s largest auto market.  “I drove their car two years ago and I love it,” said CLSA analyst Scott Laprise, referring to BYD’s hybrid car. I thought this is the winner and I thought this could go anywhere in the world because of relatively low price.  “The premium part of the valuation is zero because they can’t deliver what they promised years ago,” Laprise said.  Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway paid about $230 million in 2009 for 225 million shares in the company.  That stake was worth as much as $2.47 billion in October 2009 when the stock peaked at HK$85.5 each. The 9.6 percent stake is now worth about $467 million.  Wang said the company continued to maintain a good relationship with Buffett, but declined to comment on whether the U.S. investor would sell BYD shares.  Within Berkshire, the champion for the BYD investment has been Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, who held a personal stake even before the Berkshire investment and who has spoken of BYD’s Chairman Wang in glowing terms.  At investor meetings in April and July, Munger said he intended to stick with the BYD stake, which some took as a signal that Buffett would as well.  Buffett and Munger have also brushed aside concerns — raised by U.S. diplomats in cables released by WikiLeaks — that BYD has copied industrial designs from competitors. Diplomats have said that and other factors may keep BYD from releasing cars in the United States.  Buffett’s assistant did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.  BYD’s guidance for a further deterioration and the forecast represented a 154 million yuan ($24 million) loss to a 90 million yuan profit for the third quarter, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note.  The consensus 2011 profit forecast for the company stands at 1.7 billion yuan, according to a poll of six analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Tuesday cut the target price on BYD shares by 15 percent to HK$17, after lowering its 2011 earnings forecast by 61 percent and its 2012 forecast by 31 percent.

However, its Shenzhen-listed shares were up 1.2 percent.  The market has high expectations on BYD’s newly launched sport utility vehicle S6, and the coming G3 model, which will replace the popular F3, analysts said.  “This (profit forecast) was a surprise to the market,” said Steve Man, an analyst at Samsung Securities.  “Maybe on top of that the year-on-year comparison will be pretty easy starting from the third quarter.

78,BRKa,"Analysis: Rails, not pipes, may tame twisted oil market","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil shipments by railroad could help to end gaping price distortions in world oil markets faster than most traders have been expecting.  Rail shipments of crude from the landlocked and oversupplied Midwest to refiners in the Gulf Coast appear set to surge next year, to nearly double the volume now flowing in congested pipelines between the regions.  The shipments, which were rare until this year, have already grown to around 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) in recent months, industry sources told Reuters. Two rail terminals in St. James, Louisiana are receiving much of the crude, while other sites like Houston are taking additional crude.  The daily cargoes between the Midwest (PADD 2) and the Gulf Coast (PADD 3) could triple to 300,000 bpd by late 2012, industry sources said. Logistics firms unveiled plans for several new crude-by-rail terminals over the last four months.  Since the Department of Energy does not track crude-by-rail, there’s no official data on how much is moving.  But logistics firms say volumes are growing fast, a trend that could slash discounts of $24 a barrel on U.S. oil futures relative to oil in the Gulf Coast or Europe.  Delays in southbound pipeline construction and insufficient existing capacity have resulted in midwestern crude gluts, the main reason cited by oil traders for the unusual discounts. Railroads are emerging as a viable option for inland oil producers to get crude to coastal areas and maximize profits.  “We’re maxed out right now,” said Bill Swann of US Development Corp., referring to his crude-by-rail terminal at St. James that receives around 65,000 barrels per day, mostly from the booming Bakken Shale oilfield in North Dakota.  “We think significant volumes of crude will move by rail for years to come, so we’re building multiple origins and destinations.”  The Texas-based firm is doubling the size of its St. James terminal to receive 130,000 bpd of crude starting in October.  U.S. Development said in June it planned to build five more crude-by-rail terminals by 2013. One on the Texas Gulf Coast could receive Canadian crude, Swann said, while two others could be built on the East and West Coasts.  In futures markets, discounts of at least $18 a barrel on West Texas Intermediate crude delivered at the Cushing, Oklahoma hub persist through the end of 2012, as traders bet that pipeline bottlenecks will perpetuate a supply glut there.  Railroads could allow growing oil supply from Canada’s oil sands and North Dakota to bypass the Midwest.  “While the market frets over what pipeline will be first to bring oil out of the Midwest and into the Gulf Coast, railways are already filling the gap,” JP Morgan oil analysts wrote in a note to clients on Friday.  Crude-by-rail is gaining steam as major pipeline projects fail to get off the ground. Enterprise Products and Energy Transfer dropped plans for a 450,000 bpd pipeline between Cushing and Houston last week, citing trouble winning shipper commitments. A second major line, TransCanada’s Keystone XL to South Texas, has faced long permitting delays and staunch opposition from environmental groups.  Historically, less than 1 percent of crude has been delivered to U.S. refineries by rail. But with major southbound pipeline projects pushed back to 2013 or beyond, rail shipments are growing despite their higher cost.  It costs around $12 a barrel to ship crude by rail between Bakken and St. James, including loading fees and railcar leases, two industry sources said. The bump in traffic has left few idle tank railcars, and manufacturers are rushing to build hundreds more.  Total U.S. crude and petroleum product shipments by rail hit a record weekly high last month and reached 7,529 carloads last week, or around 780,000 bpd, up 15 percent from year-ago levels, according to the Association of American Railroads.  The trade group’s data doesn’t break out crude from oil products like gasoline, diesel or asphalt, some of which also move by rail.  EOG Resources Inc and Nustar Energy LP this month said they would expand an existing 20,000 bpd rail terminal in St. James to receive 70,000 bpd by early 2012. EOG says it could double that volume again quickly.  In April, Utah-based Savage Cos. launched plans to build a 70,000 bpd terminal in Port Arthur, Texas, for late 2012. The company is also in talks with refiners on the East and West coasts to ship them Midwestern crude by rail.  “Refineries that import crude are interested in getting it from us by rail,” said Savage manager Jared Larrabee, without naming potential customers due to confidentiality agreements.  Crude-by-rail loading capacity in North Dakota’s Bakken Shale is expected to rise from 130,000 bpd to 500,000 bpd next year, and logistics firms are offering to ship crude almost anywhere tracks can carry it.  Texas-based logistics firm Rangeland Energy struck a deal last month with Tesoro’s Anacortes refinery in Washington State to deliver Bakken crude starting in 2012.  Bakken’s growth has turned North Dakota from a tiny oil producer to a 400,000 bpd powerhouse within a few years, and some analysts expect output to hit 1 million bpd by the end of the decade. Meanwhile, crude imports from Canada have grown to around 2 million bpd, doubling since the 1990s.  For decades, the usual flow of U.S. crude has been northbound, from the Gulf Coast states to hubs like Cushing. As southbound flows grow, pipelines are running at full tilt. Some 166,000 bpd moved in pipelines between PADD 2 and PADD 3 in May, or triple the average level in 2009, according to U.S. Department of Energy data. Another 28,000 barrels moved south by barge or truck.  That means rail cargoes could surpass the southbound pipeline volumes next year, and potentially keep the advantage, at least until new lines can be built.  Railroad companies are giddy over the growth prospects. Berkshire Hathaway-owned BNSF railway said in February that it could transport 730,000 bpd of Bakken crude as production grows. Competitor Union Pacific Corp said it could quadruple Bakken-to-Gulf crude-by-rail volumes this year.  The shipments also risk creating new constraints. They have prompted a manufacturing crunch for suitable railcars to ship oil in unit trains, the 100-car configurations that are cheapest and most efficient.  “The growth has been so fast that almost every U.S. railcar with a tank that can ship crude is doing it,” said JP Fjeld-Hansen of logistics firm Musket, which is building a rail terminal in Bakken.  “People want to get it to the Gulf Coast if they can.”  ",8242011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-rail-analysis/analysis-rails-not-pipes-may-tame-twisted-oil-market-idUSTRE77M4MJ20110824
79,BRKa,Tense market falls ahead of Bernanke speech,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks fell on Thursday as investors raised cash ahead of a critical speech from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, hoping he will give them a clearer picture of the Fed’s plans for the struggling economy.  Several negatives contributed to the market’s weakness after three days of gains. Jitters over a sharp drop in German stocks and a report showing continued U.S. job market weakness helped fuel the selling.  Stocks rose earlier this week, partly on expectation the soft U.S. economy could trigger another round of monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve, much like the one suggested by Bernanke at the same conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, a year ago.  “There is an assumption there is not going to be an announcement on monetary policy, but the market set up this week like that was the case,” said Art Hogan, managing director of Lazard Capital Markets in New York.  “There seems to be a bit of a dichotomy from what people are saying to what they are doing.”  Bernanke, who is scheduled to speak on Friday at 10 a.m. EDT, is most likely to outline gradualist measures, which would disappoint those looking for dramatic action, such as a fresh round of asset purchases.  Stocks opened higher after Bank of America (BAC.N) said Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N)(BRKb.N) would be taking a $5 billion stake in the bank, whose shares had fallen to two-year lows earlier this week.  “We had some upbeat emotion at the open with Warren Buffett’s investment in Bank of America but that fizzled very quickly when we looked across the pond and saw what was going on with German markets,” said Hogan.  The S&P 500 is still up 3.2 percent so far this week, which could be the first positive one for the benchmark index in the past five.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 170.89 points, or 1.51 percent, to 11,149.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX fell 18.33 points, or 1.56 percent, to 1,159.27. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC lost 48.06 points, or 1.95 percent, to 2,419.63.  Volume has decreased from the frenzied first three weeks of August. Major averages have stabilized, with 1,120 on the S&P 500 now viewed as a key support level, but it remains to be seen whether stocks can gather enough steam for an extended rally.  “I think a lot of what’s been happening in the market is positioning or repositioning for different events,” said Doreen Mogavero, CEO of Mogavero, Lee & Co in New York. “I’m not sure how much of it is real investing.”  Bank of America gained 9.4 percent to $7.65 in trading of more than 855 million shares, or almost 10 percent of total composite volume on the day.  Citigroup (C.N) gained 4.9 percent to $29.03, but Buffett’s investment did not entice buying across the banking sector, and the KBW bank index .BKX shed 0.2 percent.  The S&P financials index .GSPF, which had been the only S&P sector in positive territory earlier in the session, declined 0.46 percent. The index had earlier climbed as much as 4.7 percent.  Apple Inc (AAPL.O) fell 0.65 percent to $373.72 on the first trading day after news that co-founder Steve Jobs resigned as chief executive.  About 8.9 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, above the year-to-date average of 7.9 billion but below the 11.2 billion average so far in August.  Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a ratio of about 16 to 5, while on the Nasdaq, more than four stocks fell for every one that rose.  The European benchmark FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 fell 1.3 percent and Germany's DAX .GDAXI dropped as much as 5 percent before closing down 1.7 percent on talk Germany could enact a short-selling ban following the example of other European nations. A German government spokesman said there were no plans for a general short-selling ban.

80,BRKa,Warren Buffett to invest $5 billion in Bank of America,"NEW YORK/CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Warren Buffett will invest $5 billion in Bank of America Corp, stepping in to shore up the largest U.S. bank in the same way he helped prop up Goldman Sachs and General Electric during the financial crisis.  Bank of America shares rose nearly 26 percent at one point, but gave up most of those gains by early afternoon, closing 9.4 percent higher at $7.65. Trading was so heavy that, at one point midday Bank of America shares made up nearly 13 percent of the composite volume for the entire stock market.  Buffett and Bank of America said he made an unsolicited call to the bank on Wednesday morning offering to make an investment. Buffett told CNBC the idea came to him while taking a bath and the deal was done in 24 hours.  The deal entails Buffett’s insurance company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc buying $5 billion of preferred shares and receiving warrants to buy 700 million shares. The warrants helped lift Berkshire Hathaway’s paper profits on the deal to more than $3 billion, although the transaction has not yet closed.  The deal is expected to close on September 1 and includes provisions barring Buffett from raising his total BofA stake past 14.9 percent. Fully exercised, at the most recent share count the warrants represent a 6.5 percent stake.  Even though the bank has said it did not need to raise capital, investors widely believed it needed more money and to show it could raise funds easily. Employees were also relieved by the news. On at least one BofA trading floor, traders cheered when the news crossed the wires.  Bank of America has been plagued by fears that bad mortgage loans and legal liabilities from loans packaged into bonds by its Countrywide unit could drag it into tens of billions of dollars in fresh losses that would stretch its capital.  The deal proved again that Berkshire Hathaway has become something of a lender of last resort to the financial system, as when it invested in Goldman Sachs Group Inc and General Electric Co. Buffett’s role in aiding the economy and the financial system has become symbolically important, given the lack of policy options left for the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve to stimulate demand.  “This proves to the market that, if the bank needs additional capital, which we don’t believe they do, but if they needed to calm the market by raising capital, they could do it within 30 minutes with a quick call to Uncle Warren,” said Sean Egan, managing principal of Egan-Jones Ratings.  The deal comes at a cost for Bank of America. The $300 million of annual dividend payments it makes will cut into earnings per share and the deal will influence its outstanding share count.  Putting together these factors, analyst John MacDonald of Sanford C. Bernstein estimated the company’s earnings per share will fall by roughly 5 percent for 2012 and 2013.  For Omaha-based Berkshire Hathaway, it is a better deal.  Berkshire gets warrants to buy 700 million shares of common stock at just over $7.14 per share, with an unusually long 10-year exercise period. One Berkshire holder said the warrants were by far the best part of the deal.  “He could well make a 100 percent return on his investment in a few years,” said James Armstrong, president of Henry H. Armstrong Associates. “It’s amazing how much a little hug from Buffett is worth these days.”  Linus Wilson, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, who has studied the pricing of warrants for large bank stocks, said warrants were worth $3.17 billion before the deal was announced, while the $5 billion of preferred shares were worth $4.46 billion, giving Buffett a total paper profit of $2.63 billion at the outset of the deal.  As the bank’s shares soared, the profit on the position jumped.  Bank of America is selling to Berkshire 50,000 shares of cumulative perpetual preferred stock with a 6 percent annual dividend. The bank can buy back the investment at any time by paying Buffett 5 percent more than the face value of the securities.  It is virtually a mirror of the deal Berkshire did with Goldman in the depths of the financial crisis in fall 2008, except Goldman paid a 10 percent dividend and had a 10 percent redemption premium. The Goldman deal paid Berkshire $15 a second in dividends until Goldman bought out Buffett earlier this year.  “It’s a reasonably priced deal for Buffett. It’s opportunistic,” said Tom Russo, a portfolio manager at Gardner, Russo & Gardner who holds Berkshire shares.  As of June 30, Berkshire had 39 percent of its equity investments in the financial sector, according to Standard & Poor’s.  Earlier this month, a $10 billion lawsuit over soured mortgage securities by American International Group Inc helped spur fears about Charlotte-based Bank of America’s liabilities, as well as questions about how it would pay for more losses.  In recent weeks, investors have sold the bank’s shares, worrying that Bank of America might need more capital — as much as $50 billion by some estimates — to cope with losses and meet capital rules.  For shareholders who watched the bank take two government bailouts and saw the government step in earlier this year to block a planned dividend raise, further dilution would have been a bitter pill to swallow.  There is no expectation regulatory approval will be needed in this case, a regulatory official said.  CEO Brian Moynihan said on August 10 that the bank could add to its capital through earnings and asset sales. His remarks came two days after the bank’s shares plunged 20 percent.  But many were not convinced. On Tuesday, blogger Henry Blodget said the bank could face $100 billion to $200 billion in write-offs and balance sheet issues, a claim the bank denied, but one that pushed its shares to early-2009 lows.  “This helps with the credibility gap that I think has existed in the minds of some shareholders,” said Jon Finger, managing partner of Finger Interests in Houston. Finger’s family sold its bank to Bank of America years ago.  Moynihan has said the bank is targeting a 6.75 to 7 percent tier 1 common capital ratio by the end of 2013 under the new Basel III rules, which are designed to ensure big banks have enough capital to withstand crises large and small.  The cost of insuring Bank of America debt against default has risen, but it fell on Thursday after the Buffett deal, down 68 basis points to 305 basis points. That means it would cost $305,000 a year for five years to insure $10 million of debt.

81,BRKa,Bank of America gives Buffett a $3 billion gift,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Bank of America Corp agreed to sell $5 billion of preferred shares to Warren Buffett, it gave the Oracle of Omaha a $3 billion gift with the deal.  The 700 million warrants attached to the preferred share sale were worth $3.17 billion when the deal was crafted, said Linus Wilson, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.  That value rose in the hours after the preferred share sale was announced publicly, as Bank of America’s share price jumped. By the close of trading, the warrants were worth $3.5 billion, Wilson said. Bank of America’s shares rose to $7.65 from $6.99 the day before, but traded as high as $8.79 in Thursday’s session.  The fact that Bank of America was willing to give away these warrants to sweeten the deal for Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway signals how keen the bank was for Buffett’s money, analysts said.  “It’s very nice of Mr. Buffett to throw $5 billion into this but we’re talking about hundreds of billions” in potential losses related to mortgage litigation, said Christopher Whalen, a managing director at Institutional Risk Analytics who analyzes bank stocks.  “It doesn’t really move the needle as far as my concern,” he said. “If Warren had written a check for $50 billion, I might have paid attention.”  Warrants are essentially options, offering an investor the right to purchase a security within a designated period of time at a particular price.  In the case of Bank of America, it gave Buffett the right to buy 700 million shares for $7.142857 apiece any time over the next 10 years.  The value of an option reflects both its “intrinsic value,” or the extent to which it can be exercised at a profit now, as well as its “time value,” or the extent to which exercising the option may be even more profitable in the future because the shares may rise from current levels.  The warrants were just part of the Buffett deal, the other part being an annual dividend of 6 percent on the $5 billion of preferred shares. That represents $300 million per year, or $75 million per quarter, until Bank of America redeems the stock.  The securities never mature, but the bank has the option to buy them back at 5 percent more than their face value any time. They were worth about $4.46 billion when the deal was put together, according to Wilson, and closed at about $4.47 billion after the announcement, which broadly lifted the market value of the bank’s securities.  Adding together the warrants and the preferreds, Buffett’s paper profit rose to $2.97 billion on the deal, from $2.63 billion when the transaction was announced.  The Bank of America warrants are worth more than three times as much as the warrants Buffett got from Goldman Sachs Group Inc in 2008, according to Wilson’s analysis.  But Jon Najarian, co-founder of options trading firm optionMONSTER, points out that “just slight moves” in the market can cause large swings in relative option values.

82,BRKa,Investors who follow Buffett in BofA may be sorry,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Following Warren Buffett is usually an easy way to make money, but in the case of the oracle’s investment in Bank of America Corp investors may find it a lot tougher.  Buffett is buying preferred shares with ample warrants thrown in as a sweetener— a deal not available to the general public.  “Bank of America won’t sell them to Joe Blow. They only will sell them to a guy named Warren Buffett,” said Jeff Matthews, a fund manager in Greenwich, Connecticut and the author of the book “Secrets in Plain Sight: Business and Investing Secrets of Warren Buffett.”  Still there is hope for investors — they can buy the shares of other bank stocks that have been beaten down, now that the sector appears to be rallying, fund managers said.  Buffett’s investing skills are beyond dispute, with a 30-year track record that outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index by 11.1 percentage points a year, according to one study. And studies show investors can profit almost as much by buying stocks that Buffett has disclosed owning.  But the Oracle of Omaha can often get a better deal than regular investors, as when he invested in Goldman Sachs Group Ind and General Electric Co via preferred shares during the 2008 financial crisis.  Those deals were similar to his Bank of America investment. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc surprised the market on Thursday with a $5 billion investment in cumulative preferred stock of Bank of America that will pay a 6 percent annual dividend. Buffett also got 700 million warrants giving him the right to buy common shares at $7.14.  In both the GE and the Goldman investments, Buffett made out well, collecting annual dividends of 10 percent. And Goldman bought back the preferred shares at a 10 percent premium in March.  But investors who followed Buffett’s moves by buying common stock have had mixed results. Goldman common shares gained almost 30 percent from when Buffett bought in until Goldman retired his preferred shares this year. GE shares have lost 36 percent since Buffett’s purchase.  “GE is still underwater, but Warren hasn’t been hurt,” said Andrew Kilpatrick, a former stock broker and journalist who authored ‘Of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett.’ “He’s still getting a dividend and he has the warrants.”  Bank of America shares shot up as much as 26 percent on Thursday after Buffett’s investment was disclosed. The shares sold off later in the day and ended with at $7.65, a gain of more than 9 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange.  “To go out now and buy Bank of America stock after it’s popped up, just to follow him, may not be the best move,” Kilpatrick said.  Still, some investors said there were other ways to piggyback on Buffett’s bank pick, which could bolster confidence in the entire banking sector.  New York hedge fund manager James Altucher, author of the book “Trade Like Warren Buffett,” said investors should consider buying shares of other banks dragged down by recent worries, such as regional Ohio bank Huntington Bancshares Inc. That bank’s shares have dropped 20 percent over the past month, but insiders such as chief executive Stephen Steinour have been buying thousands of shares recently.  “Buffett can’t buy the smaller banks like that, which is why he has to find the biggest bank of all,” Altucher said.  “It gives a good vote of confidence to the oversold U.S. banking system from the best bank analyst on the Street,” said Leora Garner, president of Laurel Grove Capital LLC in Los Angeles.  The firm’s biggest holding is Berkshire Hathaway and it also owns Bank of America shares.  American University finance professor Gerald Martin, one of the authors of a 2008 study that measured Buffett’s superior stock picking abilities, said the Bank of America deal also highlighted Buffett’s negotiating skills.  “It’s another great investment for him and shows that he makes better deals than the government,” Martin said. “A guaranteed 6 percent yield for 10 years with the upside based on a hopefully improving economy.”  ",8252011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bankofamerica-investors/investors-who-follow-buffett-in-bofa-may-be-sorry-idUSTRE77O7FW20110825

85,BRKa,US STOCKS-Tense market falls ahead of Bernanke speech,"  * Bank of America jumps after Buffett investment  * Apple losses modest after Steve Jobs resigns  * German DAX slumps, triggers U.S. stocks' slide  * Dow down 1.5 pct, S&P off 1.6 pct, Nasdaq off 1.95 pct  * For up-to-the-minute market news see [STXNEWS/US]  (Updates to close, changes comment, byline)  By Rodrigo Campos  NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday as investors raised cash ahead of a critical speech from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, hoping he will give them a clearer picture of the Fed's plans for the struggling economy.  Several negatives contributed to the market's weakness after three days of gains. Jitters over a sharp drop in German stocks and a report showing continued U.S. job market weakness helped fuel the selling.  Stocks rose earlier this week, partly on expectation the soft U.S. economy could trigger another round of monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve, much like the one suggested by Bernanke at the same conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, a year ago.  ""There is an assumption there is not going to be an announcement on monetary policy, but the market set up this week like that was the case,"" said Art Hogan, managing director of Lazard Capital Markets in New York.  ""There seems to be a bit of a dichotomy from what people are saying to what they are doing.""  Bernanke, who is scheduled to speak on Friday at 10 a.m. New York time (1400 GMT), is most likely to outline gradualist measures, which would disappoint those looking for dramatic action, such as a fresh round of asset purchases.  Stocks opened higher after Bank of America (BAC.N) said Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N)(BRKb.N) would be taking a $5 billion stake in the bank, whose shares had fallen to two-year lows earlier this week.  ""We had some upbeat emotion at the open with Warren Buffett's investment in Bank of America but that fizzled very quickly when we looked across the pond and saw what was going on with German markets,"" said Hogan.  The S&P 500 is still up 3.2 percent so far this week, which could be the first positive one for the benchmark index in the past five.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 170.89 points, or 1.51 percent, to 11,149.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX fell 18.33 points, or 1.56 percent, to 1,159.27. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC lost 48.06 points, or 1.95 percent, to 2,419.63.  Volume has decreased from the frenzied first three weeks of August. Major averages have stabilized, with 1,120 on the S&P 500 now viewed as a key support level, but it remains to be seen whether stocks can gather enough steam for an extended rally.  ""I think a lot of what's been happening in the market is positioning or repositioning for different events,"" said Doreen Mogavero, CEO of Mogavero, Lee & Co in New York. ""I'm not sure how much of it is real investing.""  Bank of America gained 9.4 percent to $7.65 in trading of more than 855 million shares, or almost 10 percent of total composite volume on the day.  Citigroup (C.N) gained 4.9 percent to $29.03, but Buffett's investment did not entice buying across the banking sector, and the KBW bank index .BKX shed 0.2 percent.  The S&P financials index .GSPF, which had been the only S&P sector in positive territory earlier in the session, declined 0.46 percent. The index had earlier climbed as much as 4.7 percent.  Apple Inc (AAPL.O) fell 0.65 percent to $373.72 on the first trading day after news that co-founder Steve Jobs resigned as chief executive. For more see [ID:nN1E77N227].  About 8.9 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, above the year-to-date average of 7.9 billion but below the 11.2 billion average so far in August.  Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a ratio of about 16 to 5, while on the Nasdaq, more than four stocks fell for every one that rose.  The European benchmark FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 fell 1.3 percent and Germany's DAX .GDAXI dropped as much as 5 percent before closing down 1.7 percent on talk Germany could enact a short-selling ban following the example of other European nations. A German government spokesman said there were no plans for a general short-selling ban.

Bank of America shares rose nearly 26 percent at one point but gave up most of those gains by early afternoon, standing 10 percent higher at $7.72. Trade was so heavy that Bank of America shares made up nearly 13 percent of the composite volume for the entire stock market.   The stock’s rise makes the warrants for Bank of America shares that Buffett gets in the deal instantly profitable.   Buffett and Bank of America said he made an unsolicited call to the bank Wednesday morning offering to make an investment. Buffett told CNBC the idea came to him while taking a bath, and the deal was done in 24 hours.   Even though the bank has said it did not need to raise capital, investors widely believed it needed more money and to show it could raise funds easily.   Bank of America has been plagued by fears that bad mortgage loans and legal liabilities from loans packaged into bonds by its Countrywide unit could drag it into tens of billions of dollars in fresh losses that would stretch its capital.   The deal proved again that Buffett has become something of a lender of last resort to the financial system, as he did with Goldman (GS.N) and GE (GE.N). Buffett’s role in aiding the economy and the financial system has become symbolically important, given the lack of policy options left for the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve to stimulate demand.   “This proves to the market that if the bank needs additional capital, which we don’t believe they do, but if they needed to calm the market by raising capital, they could do it within 30 minutes with a quick call to Uncle Warren,” said Sean Egan, managing principal of Egan-Jones Ratings.   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Factbox on Buffett’s preferred deals       [ID:nN1E77O0LE]   GE investors flash back on Buffett deal    [ID:nN1E77O0JM]   Breakingviews: BofA woes endure            [ID:nN1E77O0SW]   Felix Salmon on BofA                 reut.rs/n6HAfR  Graphic: Buffett’s deals                                   r.reuters.com/syp43s  REUTERS INSIDER - Buffett gives BofA CEO one-year lifeline   link.reuters.com/fup43s  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Buffett’s Omaha-based Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) could make out even better financially than Bank of America in the deal.

90,BRKa,BofA $8.5 billion settlement may go to federal court,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors objecting to Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) $8.5 billion settlement of claims over losses on mortgage-backed securities are seeking to send their dispute to federal court, potentially delaying a resolution of one of the beleaguered bank’s largest legal liabilities.  According to a Friday court filing, 11 entities sharing the name Walnut Place want to move the case to the U.S. District Court in Manhattan from the state supreme court in that borough.  They said the case qualifies as a “mass action” because of its size and complexity, making federal court jurisdiction appropriate. The matter has been in state court since June 29.  The settlement was intended to resolve much of Bank of America’s remaining legal liability tied to its disastrous 2008 purchase of mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp.  Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), the trustee handling 530 Countrywide mortgage pools with $174 billion of unpaid principal balances, negotiated the settlement with 22 institutional investors, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and Allianz SE’s (ALVG.DE) Pimco.  Investors unhappy with the payout or disclosures had until August 30 to intervene in the case, ahead of a November 17 court hearing. Friday’s filing may upset that timetable.  Bank of New York Mellon will seek to move the case back to state court and believes Walnut Place’s effort “is unsupported by the law and will only serve to delay the resolution of the proceeding,” bank spokesman Kevin Heine said.  Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson called the Walnut Place filing “tactical maneuvering.”  David Grais and Owen Cyrulnik, lawyers for Walnut Place, did not respond to emailed requests for comment.  Worries about how much Bank of America will ultimately have to pay angry mortgage securities investors, including in a $10 billion lawsuit by the insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N), had driven down the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank’s share price to a nearly two and a half year low.  On Thursday, however, the bank won a vote of confidence in the form of a $5 billion investment from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N).  Other investors challenging the $8.5 billion settlement include pension funds and insurers, and six Federal Home Loan Banks, which offer financing for mortgage and business loans.  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on August 4 announced his own opposition, suggesting the payout is too low and that Bank of New York Mellon is conflicted and could receive financial benefits from the accord.  A Schneiderman spokeswoman on Friday declined to comment.  The federal case is assigned to U.S. District Judge William Pauley.

94,BRKa,Analysis: Buffett trades off his reputation,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett showed again that his name and money is enough to give a struggling company instant credibility in the market. But the legendary investor also demonstrated his canny command of that reputation means that such deals can immediately generate profits.  Bank of America Corp on Thursday said Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway would invest $5 billion in the bank, the largest by assets in the United States.  Buffett, known for his grand gestures and his calls to buy American assets, may have looked like he was a lender of last resort — or at least a lender of last credible resort — but he was also turning a hefty profit, experts said.  “He’s not doing it out of charitable motive or even out of a concern for the safety and soundness of the financial system,” said Robert Reich, who served in three U.S. governments, most recently as secretary of labor under President Bill Clinton.  “He’s got a lot of shareholders and they depend upon him to maximize the value of their investments,” said Reich, now a public policy professor at the University of California Berkeley.  Bank of America’s shares had been sinking on worries that it might need a massive injection of capital, a major concern given the importance of the bank to the American financial system.  Buffett is buying preferred shares and receiving warrants. The deal guarantees Berkshire $300 million a year in dividends and offers a chance for huge returns if the stock climbs.  At one point on Thursday the shares climbed 25.8 percent. By the close those gains were trimmed back to 9.4 percent, but Berkshire was still sitting on a paper profit of nearly $3 billion.  Berkshire Class A shares closed down 2.8 percent at $103,415 on Thursday, while its Class B shares closed 2.5 percent lower at $68.99.  In many ways, Buffett has perfected the art of swooping in at the last minute when he thinks an American icon is undervalued and has hit troubled times.  Back in the late 1980s, Buffett purchased a stake in Salomon Brothers and even temporarily stepped in as chairman after a trading scandal threatened the company.  The investment was ultimately profitable but for a while looked like it could turn into a bankruptcy, the inside story of which was described in an October 1997 Fortune magazine article.  Since then, Buffett has continued to profit on financial stocks.  During the 2008 financial crisis, he invested $5 billion in Goldman Sachs Group Inc and $3 billion in General Electric Co.  Buffet got a 10 percent dividend on each of those investments.  The investment in Goldman famously earned him the equivalent of more than $15 in dividends each second, or $500 million per year.  In March, Goldman said it would buy back its preferred stock from Buffett at the agreed upon 10 percent premium.  GE, which also has an agreement with Buffett that includes a 10 percent redemption premium, plans to buy back its shares in October. By then, dividends will have topped $900 million.  In the Bank of America deal, the annual dividend may only be 6 percent, but that isn’t bad at a time when an investor can only get a 2.2 percent yield on a 10-year Treasury note or next to nothing from a bank deposit or money-market fund.  “Mr. Buffett is a very shrewd investor and is not altruistic at all. The terms he gets are very favorable to him,” said Richard Bernstein, former chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch and current CEO of investment advisory Richard Bernstein Advisors.  “Too bad the government didn’t do the same with TARP. Taxpayers got ripped off in comparison to the terms Mr. Buffett got,” Bernstein said in an e-mail referencing the U.S. government’s bank rescue plan, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which was introduced in 2008.  Buffett has shown he won’t invest in a storied name just because it is in trouble, though. He turned down pleas from Lehman Brothers then-CEO Dick Fuld for an injection of capital before it collapsed.  Financial experts said Buffett at times may almost seem as powerful a player in financial markets as the government or the Federal Reserve.  “Warren is not the Fed and is not a branch of government, but he comes about as close as any private individual can come to having the power of public policy,” Reich said.  Mark Zandi, Moody’s Analytics’ chief economist and former adviser to 2008 Republican presidential candidate John McCain, said a lot of it has to do with confidence.  “Our most serious economic problem at this point in time is a lack of confidence. We’ve lost faith in our economy and I think (Buffett) is working really hard to shore up confidence.”  ",8262011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-buffett-banks/analysis-buffett-trades-off-his-reputation-idUSTRE77P0TX20110826

98,BRKa,Early estimates suggest Irene losses tame,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene caused between $200 million and $400 million in insured losses in the Carolinas, catastrophe modeling company EQECAT said on Sunday, suggesting the storm may have been far less severe than the insurance industry feared.  The bigger question, though, is how much coverage people have for the severe flooding that struck New York and New Jersey, and whether the federal government’s flood program can handle all of the claims.  EQECAT said the bulk of the losses it has seen so far come particularly from storm surge and flooding.  Combined with its estimate of $300 million to $600 million in insured losses from a direct hit on parts of the Caribbean, EQECAT now puts Irene’s total damage so far in a range of $500 million to $1 billion.  That is far less than its competitor, AIR Worldwide, which estimated Irene’s damages in the Caribbean at $1.1 billion.  It is not unusual for catastrophe modeling companies, whose software is used by insurers to model their exposure to natural disasters, to differ widely in their initial loss estimates.  The figures tend to be revised as the days go by and the companies send more teams to the disaster sites to survey losses first-hand.  Still, the early figures compare with some projections by meteorologists and statisticians that Irene could be a $10 billion or more event. Much will depend on how much damage the storm did in the greater New York area.  Loss estimates on the rest of the U.S. East Coast are expected on Monday.  Nationwide Mutual, one of the country’s largest property insurers, said it received 6,000 claims calls on Sunday, which is twice what it would usually expect on the Sunday after a major storm.  A spokeswoman for the company said that presents a mystery that could take days to clarify.  They can not tell yet whether they are getting an unusually high volume of claims, which would imply a lot of storm damage, or whether more people are calling than usual because they have already gotten home after the storm, which would imply it was somewhat mild.  “Generally what we’re seeing as you move east is a lot of trees on houses, widespread power outages and as you get closer and closer to the coast, we’ve got coastal flooding, the power outages are even more widespread,” said Brian Maness, a claims manager for the company in North Carolina.  In New Jersey, the state is expecting damage in “the billions of dollars, if not in the tens of billions of dollars,” Gov. Chris Christie told NBC’s “Meet the Press.”  By all accounts, in cities like Jersey City, Montclair, Nutley and Hoboken, that damage will come in large part from flooding that put in some cases multiple feet of water into homes.  New Jersey is the fourth-most insured state by the National Flood Insurance Program, which writes almost all of the flood insurance in the United States.  The state has $51.88 billion of insurance in force from the NFIP, and Jersey City and Hoboken are two of the most insured cities in the state. On the other hand, for example, Montclair and Nutley are two of the least.  Congress is working on a reform package for the NFIP, which has been surviving on a series of one-year extensions amid a debate about the cost of the program and its role in keeping the private sector largely out of the flood insurance business.

Energy stocks, up 2.1 percent, powered much of the rally. Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ.TO) was the most heavily weighted climber, jumping 3 percent to C$35.89 as oil prices advanced on strong U.S. equities, relief that Hurricane Irene did less damage than feared in the New York area, and a weaker U.S. dollar. [O/R]  Fertilizer producer Potash Corp POT.TO was the second biggest gainer, up 2.2 percent at C$57.36 as grain prices rose.  Heavyweight financials, up 1 percent, were also among the top advancers at the start of the second week of bank-earnings season. Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS.TO) rose 1.7 percent to C$52.21, while Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) added 1 percent to C$74.61.

Earlier in the day, it was up almost 1 percent at 12,446.06, its highest level since Aug. 18.  Don Vialoux, a technical analyst at JovInvestment Management, said the TSX's short-term momentum indicators are positive as they continue to recover from oversold levels and as the index has recently outperformed the S&P 500.  He noted a natural place for the TSX's recovery to advance to is where it broke a key support level at 12,764, which is also very close to its 50-day moving average.  ""I'm looking for the market to be quite strong over the next week or two, followed by at least a moderate test of its August low, followed by a very important move on the upside starting in October,"" he added.  Markets started to embrace risk assets after Friday's speech by Bernanke. Though he gave no details of further measures to boost the U.S. economy, he said the central bank's policy panel would meet for two days next month instead of one to discuss additional monetary stimulus, offering some hope to the market of a move then.

106,BRKa,UPDATE 2-BYD plans to cut sales staff by 70 pct -media," (Adds comments by BYD executives, background, context)	   * BYD did not confirm details, but calls it normal reshuffle   * BYD sales plunge, lags market and rivals    By Fang Yan and Ken Wills	   BEIJING, Aug 30 (Reuters) - BYD Co Ltd  , a Chinese carmaker backed by U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett, plans to cut its sales force by about 70 percent, a Chinese website said on Tuesday, after the company reported a nearly 90 percent drop in first-half earnings.	   About 1,000 people in BYD’s sales arm will be asked to resign, with the ultimate goal of cutting the headcount to 800 from 2,600, eeo.com.cn said on Tuesday, citing unnamed BYD employees.	   A mid-level executive at BYD told Reuters the initial layoff target was as much as 1,600 people, but the timing of the planned cuts was not clear.	   BYD did not confirm details of the layoff plan.	   However, Li Yunfei, assistant to BYD’s general manager, said on his personal microblog posted on Sina.com that the move was a normal personnel transfer for the company’s sales arm.	   “The sales division has not dissolved or (been) eliminated. The personnel reshuffle is aimed at improving our sales service, raising the efficiency internally and externally,” he said, without elaborating.	   The layoffs represent a small amount of the overall global staff of 120,000 at BYD, which also makes cellphones and batteries. Further layoffs in other departments were possible, the website report said.	   BYD has been a shining star since it received an investment of $230 million from Buffet in 2009. Its F3 sedan was China’s best-selling car in 2009 and 2010, but it has been unable to build on its initial success.	   A lack of competitive new models makes it particularly vulnerable after the government stripped away tax incentives for small cars at the end of last year.	   BYD, percent-owned by Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), reported a first-half net profit of 275.36 million  yuan ($42 million), down 89 percent from a year earlier. Geely Automobile Holdings , meanwhile, managed to grow its net income by 17 percent in the first half, while larger SAIC Motor Corp  reported a 46 percent jump in earnings.	   Xia Zhibin, head of the BYD’s sales unit, resigned earlier in August, citing personal reasons. Analysts said slumping sales were likely to have played a part in the move.	   Plunging sales, a failure to deliver its promised green car plan and delays in the U.S. launch of its e6 electric sedan have led some to question the wisdom of Buffet’s investment in the company.	   Wang said the company continued to maintain a good relationship with Buffett, but declined to comment on whether the U.S. investor would sell any BYD shares. 	   At investor meetings in April and July, Berkshire’s vice chairman, Charlie Munger, said he intended to stick with the BYD stake, which some took as a signal that Buffett would as well.  	   BYD’s H shares, traded in Hong Kong, closed down 0.9 percent at HK$15.48, lagging a 1.71 percent gain in the Hang Seng Index  	 	  (Additional reporting by Alison Leung in Hong Kong and Li Ran in Beijing; Editing by Matt Driskill)	  	  ",8302011,http://www.reuters.com/article/byd/update-2-byd-plans-to-cut-sales-staff-by-70-pct-media-idUSL4E7JU1E220110830

Berkshire had already owned 80 percent of Wesco for decades when it struck a deal to buy the rest in February. Buffett’s business partner and Berkshire’s vice chairman, Charlie Munger, ran Wesco and often described the unusual structure of the company as a historical accident.

112,BRKa,Blackstone boss calls for flat tax for U.S.," * Schwarzman says tax reform important   * His personal tax rate is 53 pct   * Flat tax is one way to get satisfactory resolution   NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) chief executive Stephen Schwarzman called on Wednesday for a flat tax in the United States to create an “inherent sense of fairness,” according to an interview he gave on CNBC.   Schwarzman, who became a billionaire building up and taking public the private equity firm, said confidence in the country “has been strained to broken” and the United States needed to be “relaunched.”   Schwarzman told CNBC his personal tax rate is 53 percent, which he said was 36 percent federal and 17 percent state and local, and described it as “one of the highest tax rates actually in the world.”   “I think tax reform is an important issue ... Everyone is going to be giving up something,” he said. “In terms of tax reform, one way to get to a satisfactory resolution is actually to have a flat tax. Whether you have one level of flat tax or two levels of flat tax, or a higher one for people who earn more, or a lower one for people who earn less, you have to have an inherent sense of fairness.”   Schwarzman said, while he did not feel “undertaxed,” people need to feel they are getting the same treatment as their neighbour.   “If some people are left out and some people have special deals, it doesn’t feel like the kind of situation where everyone’s going to get on board,” he said.   A long fight over debt and deficits ended in early August with a deal that averted a national default, but dented America’s stature as the world’s economic superpower and failed to stave off the first U.S. credit downgrade. [nN1E7800PT]   Round two comes this month when Democrats and Republicans begin to negotiate what should be included in a deficit-reduction package that must contain at least $1.2 trillion in savings. Obama wants higher taxes to be part of the package. The Republicans, driven by Tea Party conservatives in their ranks, are demanding spending cuts with no new taxes.   Billionaire Warren Buffett, chairman of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), recently called for higher taxes for the rich, arguing the wealthy had been “coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress.”   Buffett said his federal tax bill last year was $6,938,744, the equivalent of 64 shares of Berkshire Class A stock.   “That sounds like a lot of money,” Buffett said in August in the New York Times. “But what I paid was only 17.4 percent of my taxable income — and that’s actually a lower percentage than was paid by any of the other 20 people in our office.”   (Editing by Andre Grenon)     ",9072011,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackstone-tax/blackstone-boss-calls-for-flat-tax-for-u-s-idUSN1E7861H220110907
113,BRKa,Dealtalk: Not For Sale? ... The Washington Post,"(Reuters) - Founded 134 years ago, The Washington Post newspaper is a byword for Pulitzer prize-winning political reporting. Think Watergate.  But the storied broadsheet has lost money for three years, and some shareholders of owner The Washington Post Co wouldn’t weep if the paper were sold, allowing the company to focus on its for-profit education and cable businesses.  “The reason we own the stock isn’t because of its newspaper business, it’s in spite of it,” said Charles de Vaulx at International Value Advisers, whose 7.4 percent stake in the company is the second-largest external holding after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s near-26 percent.  The Graham family has owned the company since it was bought in a bankruptcy auction in 1933, and controls most of the voting stock.  “If they ever reach the conclusion that one of their businesses, for instance, the newspaper business, is hopeless, I wish they’ll be willing to cut the cord and not feel any emotional attachment,” de Vaulx added in response to Reuters’ questions on a possible sale of the Post. The company has not said it has any such plans.  The Washington Post Co is struggling not only with falling advertising revenue, but also with slowing profit at its Kaplan education unit.  The company did cast off one of its titles last year, selling the international weekly news magazine Newsweek to stereo magnate Sidney Harman for a token $1 plus $47 million in liabilities. Harman died earlier this year.  After that deal, The Washington Post Co Chairman and CEO Donald Graham, son of former publisher Katharine Graham, wrote to shareholders saying the company would look at selling businesses if “they are losing money and we think they are unlikely to return to profit.”  Ajay Sadarangani, senior analyst at Manning & Napier Advisors, which holds a 6.6 percent stake in The Washington Post Co, believes the Graham family would have no qualms in applying that performance yardstick to the flagship newspaper.  “If the newspaper gets to a point that there’s no way out or there’s no feasible plan to turn it around, I don’t think they’ll not sell it or shut it down,” he said.  So, could one of the great names of print media be put on the block?  Donald Graham declined to be interviewed for this article, but in an e-mail exchange made his stance clear.  “The answer to your question is no. That is spelled n-o,” he wrote.  In 2007, the Bancroft family agreed to the sale of The Wall Street Journal, one of the leading global financial newspapers, to Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp — after rejecting an initial approach — at a 67 percent premium to the paper’s publisher Dow Jones’ share price.  That same year saw the Chandler family’s Tribune Co, owner of a stable of major newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune, taken private by real estate magnate Sam Zell. It filed for bankruptcy in 2008.  While Graham says ‘no’ to selling the paper, investors wouldn’t mind some sort of shake up at the company.  The Washington Post Co shares, valued at just above $2.5 billion, traded near $1,000 apiece seven years ago. Last year, they hit a 14-year low. The stock is down 37 percent in 2011.  De Vaulx reckons the company is worth more than $600 a share — almost double its current market level — and expects more share buybacks, while Sadarangani said he would like management to explore spinning off the cable business.  They think the current stock price — trading at around $316 — represents only the value of the cable and broadcast business, and discounts the education and newspaper businesses.  The Kaplan division — which helps more than 1 million students a year from kindergarten through to higher education and professional training — has had a torrid couple of years as regulators took aim at the for-profit education sector.  The education division, traditionally the company’s cash cow, accounts for around 60 percent of total revenue.  PAA Research analyst Bradley Safalow said last month he did not expect Kaplan Higher Education to generate any profit “as we get into the fourth quarter and 2012.  In May, Standard & Poor’s placed its ratings for The Washington Post Co on CreditWatch with negative implications, specifically citing the weaker performance at Kaplan.  For now, the cable television division and its broadcasting unit are bright spots.  The newspaper division has lost money since 2008, when it reported a $192.7 million operating loss, largely on early retirement costs. Those losses have narrowed, to $164 million in 2009 and just $9.8 million last year, as the paper took restructuring measures and the economy emerged from recession.  Print advertising revenue at The Washington Post declined 6 percent to below $300 million in 2010.  De Vaulx values the newspaper business at $120-$260 million, and said he’d be disappointed if the Post’s losses or EBITDA minus capex exceeded $15-$20 million for a few years in a row.  Many in the media industry just don’t see the Post being sacrificed.  “The Graham family is a newspaper family, and I cannot envision any future scenario that would involve them spinning off the Washington Post,” said industry analyst John Morton.

115,BRKa,Shareholders push but Washington Post CEO reluctant to sell,"(Reuters) - The Washington Post Co’s WPO.N Chief Executive Officer Donald Graham said he was reluctant to sell or spin off any of his company’s businesses amid pressure from shareholders to consider such a move.  Speaking at the company’s shareholders meeting on Friday, Graham said he would follow the footsteps of his friend and adviser Warren Buffett, the billionaire head of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N).  “We are exceptionally reluctant to sell any business,” Graham said. “We would only contemplate it if the business is losing money and we cannot see a way out or if labor relations are terrible — that is quoting Warren, not me.”  Buffett is the largest shareholder with a near-26 percent stake and until recently was on the company’s board.  Buffett, once a paper boy, has owned Washington Post shares for decades and was good friends with Graham’s mother Katharine.  Washington Post has four main divisions - newspaper, education, cable and broadcast.  Graham, whose family has owned the Washington Post Co since 1933, was responding to what he called “a lot of questions” about why the company would not spin off or sell certain businesses.  Shareholders asked about a sale of the company’s flagship newspaper and a spin-off of the cable business.  Graham repeated to shareholders what he told Reuters recently about a possible sale of the loss-making newspaper division: “no and that is spelled n-o.”  Heather McPherson of T. Rowe Price, which manages about $520 billion in assets and owns 1.25 percent of the Washington Post Co, pushed Graham on his reluctance to spin off the cable business.  Graham responded that the company was not into “financial engineering.”  Graham, 65, also said he plans to continue as CEO for a few more years.  Some shareholders told Reuters they would not mind some sort of shake-up at The Washington Post Co, which they think is worth much more than the current $2.5 billion.  The company’s stock has been hammered by falling advertising revenue at its newspaper division and regulatory troubles at its Kaplan education unit.  Kaplan has been hit by slowing enrollment growth due to new government rules that called for better graduation and job placement rates from for-profit colleges.  “We lobbied like hell to prevent the adoption (of the rules),” Graham said at the meeting. “But I do not think anyone is going to visit the for-profit education rules for years.”  The stock has fallen 37 percent so far in 2011. It used to trade near $1,000 a share seven years ago.

116,BRKa,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Shareholders push but Washington Post CEO reluctant to sell," (Corrects to fix spelling of Katharine Graham’s name in paragraph 5)	   By A. Ananthalakshmi	   Sept 9 (Reuters) - The Washington Post Co’s Chief Executive Officer Donald Graham said he was reluctant to sell or spin off any of his company’s businesses amid pressure from shareholders to consider such a move.	   Speaking at the company’s shareholders meeting on Friday, Graham said he would follow the footsteps of his friend and adviser Warren Buffett, the billionaire head of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N).	   “We are exceptionally reluctant to sell any business,” Graham said. “We would only contemplate it if the business is losing money and we can not see a way out or if labor relations are terrible — that is quoting Warren, not me.”	   Buffett is the largest shareholder with a near-26 percent stake and until recently was on the company’s board.	   Buffett, once a paper boy, has owned Washington Post shares for decades and was good friends with Graham’s mother Katharine.	   Washington Post has four main divisions - newspaper, education, cable and broadcast. 	   Graham, whose family has owned the Washington Post Co since 1933, was responding to what he called “a lot of questions” about why the company would not spin off or sell certain businesses. 	   Shareholders asked about a sale of the company’s flagship newspaper and a spin-off of the cable business.	   Graham repeated to shareholders what he told Reuters recently about a possible sale of the loss-making newspaper division: “no and that is spelled n-o.”	   Heather McPherson of T. Rowe Price, which manages about $520 billion in assets and owns 1.25 percent of the Washington Post Co, pushed Graham on his reluctance to spin off the cable business. 	   Graham responded that the company was not into “financial engineering.”	   Graham, 65, also said he plans to continue as CEO for a few more years.   	   Some shareholders told Reuters they would not mind some sort of shake-up at The Washington Post Co, which they think is worth much more than the current $2.5 billion.  	   The company’s stock has been hammered by falling advertising revenue at its newspaper division and regulatory troubles at its Kaplan education unit.	   Kaplan has been hit by slowing enrollment growth due to new government rules that called for better graduation and job placement rates from for-profit colleges.	   “We lobbied like hell to prevent the adoption (of the rules),” Graham said at the meeting. “But I do not think anyone is going to visit the for-profit education rules for years.”	   The stock has fallen 37 percent so far in 2011. It used to trade near $1,000 a share seven years ago.      	   On Thursday, the company said it would buy back up to 750,000 shares, or 11 percent, of its Class B common stock, as it looks to shore up its stock price.  	   Graham said he was “obviously disappointed by the stock price.” 	  (Reporting by A.

117,BRKa,Insight: Extreme makeover BofA: An asbestos solution,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - It worked for asbestos so why not for toxic mortgages?  When some look at all of the litigation arising from Bank of America’s big role in the U.S. mortgage mess, they start thinking of asbestos and how thousands of lawsuits arising from that cancer-causing product brought down many manufacturers more than a decade ago.  The solution back then to dealing with claims filed by more than 750,000 workers exposed to asbestos was the creation of dozens of “asbestos settlement trusts,” which have paid out tens of billions dollars in damages. Some of them are still going strong today.  The asbestos trusts were seen as an innovative approach to deal with seemingly endless litigation and provide a measure of compensation to sick workers and their families. The system for dealing with claims also allowed some of the hobbled manufacturers to emerge from bankruptcy largely free of the crushing weight of lawsuits.  Now some investors in soured mortgage-backed bonds sold by Bank of America and advocates for struggling homeowners are wondering whether a similar strategy can be used to deal with litigation claims that Wall Street analysts estimate could cost the nation’s biggest bank more than $50 billion.  “We’ve suggested an asbestos-style settlement as a solution. It makes the most sense,” says Vincent Fiorillo, a portfolio manager with DoubleLine Capital, a $15 billion bond shop that has its own pending claims against the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender. “It is better than where we are right now.”  The idea of using the asbestos litigation wars as a model for dealing with the fallout from the financial crisis is more talk than anything else. There’s no indication an asbestos-style litigation trust is something Bank of America is actively considering at the moment.  But efforts to find a creative solution to Bank of America’s multi-pronged exposure to Countrywide’s ailing mortgage portfolio become more urgent with each downward tick in the bank’s already depressed share price.  On Wall Street, once extreme ideas - such as spinning off the bank’s Merrill Lynch investment arm to raise additional capital or placing all of its rotting mortgages into a so-called bad bank managed by federal regulators - are being bandied about quite freely. Calls to break up Bank of America are no longer just idle chatter of hedge fund traders selling short its shares.  Just this week, Chris Whalen, a bank analyst and co-founder of Institutional Risk Analytics, was out calling for a Chapter 11 restructuring of Bank of America.  “You need to do something radical, which changes the framework so people can start thinking with their brains again,” says William Black, an associate professor of law and economics at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law and former litigation director of the old Federal Home Loan Bank Board during the run-up to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.  So far, Bank of America’s management has shied away from drastic measures and instead has begun taking a variety of incremental steps to assure Wall Street it has adequate capital to deal with the onslaught of mortgage-related lawsuits from bond investors, the American International Group, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and others. In August, the bank got a badly needed $5 billion cash infusion from Warren Buffett that helped stop the stock’s 49 percent slide this year. It quickly followed-up that deal by selling half of its stake in China Construction Bank for $8.3 billion.  Chief executive officer Brian Moynihan is also mulling a plan to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs over the next several years. On Tuesday, he began a management shuffle by ousting two top executives, Sallie Krawcheck and Joe Price. Analysts expect even more structural changes in the coming weeks, as Moynihan seeks to give a jolt to the bank’s beaten down stock, currently trading around $7.  The bank has set aside more than $15 billion in litigation reserves and contends it is well-positioned to defend itself against the wave of mortgage-related lawsuits. It is bracing itself for a war of attrition with mortgage bond investors, who claim the bank and its Countrywide subsidiary sometimes knowingly stuffed those securities with shoddy home loans. A bank spokesman declined to comment on whether it would consider an asbestos-style trust to deal with mortgage-related claims.  A Federal Reserve spokesman also declined to comment.  This is not the first time that some have talked about a litigation trust as a mechanism to deal with some of Wall Street’s liability arising from the collapse of the U.S. housing market. In the early days of the financial crisis, regulators discussed the merits of using an asbestos-style trust to resolve potential litigation claims against the biggest U.S. banks. But regulators ultimately rejected the trust concept along with other novel ideas that were deemed either unworkable or politically untenable.  One appeal to a trust solution, according to proponents, is that it would be a way for a bank to essentially hive off its litigation liability and establish a mechanism for dealing with claims and litigation. The advocates suggest it would be a way for Bank of America to get a “fresh start” without involving a bankruptcy or a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-imposed receivership.  But an asbestos trust is no magic bullet either. The insurance industry continues to be plagued with new asbestos-related claims years after the trusts were created. Credit rating agency Moody’s Investors Service recently said after asbestos being a “back burner” issues for years, the U.S. insurance industry is recently seeing an uptick in new asbestos claims.  And the problem with any trust is that it must be adequately capitalized. The amount of money the bank would have to commit would no doubt be contentious and costly to shareholders and potentially bondholders as well.  The easiest way to fund a litigation trust would be for Bank of America to issue new shares, something that would severely reduce the value of its existing stock. That’s not the kind of plan that will sit well with stockholders, whose shares are already trading well below the bank’s stated book value of $20 a share.  “You’d have to go to the market and raise capital for this and that would dilute shares,” says Australian hedge fund manager John Hempton, whose Bronte Capital owns a sizable stake in the bank. “That is the last thing BofA wants to do right now.”  Frank Partnoy, a former Wall Street derivatives trader and now a law professor at the University of San Diego, said a litigation trust also could be partially funded by the issuance of a specialized security called a litigation tracking warrant. He said these warrants could be sold to public investors and offered to current Bank of America shareholders allowing them to share in any of the trust’s proceeds that remain after all the litigation has been resolved.  “There are precedents for having publicly traded securities to track how litigation will turn out,” said Partnoy.  He explained that a number of banks issued litigation tracking securities in the wake of the savings and loans crisis, when they tried to sue the federal government for wiping out billions of dollars in goodwill on those institutions’ balance sheets. The tracking stocks were a way for the institutions to raise cash to finance the litigation.  But if some momentum was building for a radical solution, Buffett’s $5 billion investment changed that. Now even some early advocates of an asbestos-style litigation trust are having second thoughts.  “The dynamics have changed dramatically since Buffett entered the picture,” says Sean Egan, a principal of Egan-Jones Ratings Company, an independent rating shop which has eased up on its once bearish view of Bank of America. “It’s a kiss of approval,” he added, even though the bank is paying a rich 6 percent dividend on the preferred stock it sold to Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.  Egan says an asbestos-style trust seemed like a plausible solution during the summer when Bank of America seemed to have few friends in the equity markets. But now, Egan says, to set up a litigation trust would “create a total mess” and “be patently unfair to existing shareholders.”  Just a few months ago, Egan discussed the merits of such a trust with several mortgage-backed securities investors now sparring with Bank of America. Those investors claim the bank is obligated to buy back the underlying home loans in those now soured bonds because the mortgages were issued to homebuyers who either obviously lacked the income to keep making monthly payments, or were duped into taking out greater loans than they could afford.  But Egan says now that the share price hemorrhaging has stopped, Bank of America can focus on taking steps to earn its way out of the litigation crisis.  Much of the search for a radical solution stems from an ongoing debate on Wall Street about whether the bank can earn enough money over time to pay out claims and add money to its legal reserves if necessary.  Most of the bulls who believe Bank of America can earn its way out of its legal quagmire freely admit that the bank’s stock is not likely to do much the next several years. Says Hempton of Bronte Capital: “I own a zombie bank.”  Under a relatively conservative long-term banking industry growth rate of 3.3 percent, Bank of America could earn about $50 billion in pre-tax profits from 2012 through 2016. That’s about equal to the amount most analysts peg the bank’s long-term mortgage legal liability at, if it fares poorly in litigation.  Banking analyst Charles Peabody, a partner with Portales Partners, says the strategy at Bank of America is to shed assets and reduce expenses, and he thinks it can work. “I understand the game plan, and if time is given, they can get through this without raising equity.”  The more bearish investors, by contrast, point out that another recession could throw a big monkey wrench into those profit projections. And predicting legal liability is notoriously difficult. In fact, analysts like Whalen say Bank of America could find itself having to pay as much as $100 billion in damages to mortgage bond investors and homeowners.  Skeptics also point out that in the coming years, Bank of America will need to boost capital by $50 billion in order to comply with new international banking regulations designed to make sure banks are not taking on too much risk.  And next year, Bank of America will need to refinance at least $40 billion in corporate debt that is coming due. In a worst case scenario, the bank has more than $400 billion in liquid assets to pay off any maturing debt.  It’s a lot of capital raising and skeptics worry that could hamper Bank of America’s ability to generate new commercial and residential loans for the next several years. That’s one reason people like Black, who want to break Bank of America apart, say something needs to be done to change the narrative because it’s not healthy for one of the nation’s biggest banks to exist in stasis for years to come.  “If you leave your major banks slowly twisting in the wind in this pathetic zombie condition, they are not going to be effective institutions,” says Black.  In the case of Countrywide, Black says the damage was done to Bank of America the moment that Kenneth Lewis, the bank’s former chief executive officer, pulled the trigger on the deal in early 2008. The Countrywide acquisition was a “pure ego play” for Lewis, who stepped down in December 2009 and was replaced by Moynihan.  In retrospect, if Countrywide had not been acquired and was ultimately taken over by the federal government, it would have been easier for all sides to begin working out deals with financially-strapped borrowers to reduce the principal owed on mortgages and home equity loans. Black says it’s still not too late to do meaningful home loan modifications, but that’s only going to happen in the context of a “bad bank” overseen by an FDIC receiver.  The latest report by the Treasury Department gave low marks to Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase & Co in working to strike deals with struggling homeowners. In a September 1 statement, the Treasury Department said both Bank of America and JPMorgan “remain in need of substantial improvement” when it comes to servicing mortgages and agreeing to permanent loan modifications.  Homeowner advocates say in any kind of overarching settlement - whether it be an asbestos-style trust, a bad bank, or the sale of litigation warrants - borrowers should have a voice as well. A group of them represented by Mississippi attorney Don Barrett has filed an objection to a proposed $8.5 billion settlement that Bank of America reached this summer with some of the nation’s biggest bond investors, including BlackRock, Pacific Investment Management Co. and TCW.  Barrett says homeowners object to the settlement because the terms of the deal would make it even harder to negotiate a loan modification in the future. He cites a recent report prepared by National Consumer Law Center, which concludes that the settlement agreement “will speed up foreclosures, perpetuate existing servicing abuses in the system and undermine federal programs designed to stabilize the housing market.”  The Center, which prepared the report at Barrett’s request, says that in negotiating the deal with big mortgage-backed bond investors, little concern was paid to the interest of the homeowners, who took out the loans that were later bundled into bonds.  “There has got to be a solution where the borrowers’ interests are taken into account. We are the third leg of the stool,” says Barrett. “The current way of doing things is broken. And if it isn’t fixed, it is going to take Bank of America down.” (Additional reporting by Sam Forgione, Ben Berkowitz and Michael Tarsala; editing by Michael Williams and Claudia Parsons)",9092011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bankofamerica-solutions/insight-extreme-makeover-bofa-an-asbestos-solution-idUSTRE78854U20110909

Wang said capital expenditure would reach 8-9 billion yuan this year and 5-6 billion yuan in 2012, versus more than 10 billion yuan last year.	   The Shenzhen-based company is seeking shareholder approval for a proposed domestic corporate bond issue to raise up to 6 billion yuan ($938.4 million) to cut debt and supplement working capital.

A lack of competitive new models has made it particularly vulnerable after the government stripped away tax incentives for small cars at the end of last year.

121,BRKa,Berkshire's Richline to buy Italian jeweler,"VICENZA, Italy (Reuters) - Jewelry company Richline International, part of billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), will buy its fifth small Italian jewelry brand as it plans to expand further in Italy.  Italy-based Richline International, fully owned by Berkshire’s unit Richline Group, said in a statement it has signed a letter of intent to buy the production, design, intellectual property and distribution rights of Carniani.  It did not disclose financial details of the deal.  Lucio Carniani, who would continue to run his gold and silver jewelry maker, told Reuters his company revenues came in at 4 million euros ($5.63 million) last year.  Earlier this year, U.S. jewelry manufacturer and distributor Richline Group, has bought four privately held Italian jewelry brands: children’s jewelry maker Erz, earrings and bracelets maker Farinex, 7AR and Zeno, fuelling expectations that other deals could be in the pipeline.  Richline is looking for other acquisitions on the Italian jewelry market after the Carniani deal, Dennis Ulrich, chief executive officer of Richline Group, told Reuters.  “We are looking to expand ... We always have ongoing conversations (about possible acquisitions) ... A bigger acquisition is not excluded,” Ulrich said in an interview at an international jewelry trade fair.  Richline could be interested in small artisanal jewelry makers and in industrial companies as long as they produce high quality creative products, Ulrich said.  Italian jewelry highly fragmented manufacturing sector, made up mostly of small family-owned companies, has been hit hard by the 2008/2009 financial crisis and many companies need cash injections to keep going.  Richline Group, which was formed in 2007 and includes such brands as Andin, Alarama, Aurafin, Auragem and Bel-Oro (www.richlinegroup.com), made $500 million in sales last year, Ulrich said.  With buying Italian companies and setting up Richline International as a hub for further expansion, Richline Group goes beyond its traditional North American markets to boost sales in Italy, France, Germany, Britain, Scandinavia and reach as far as Australia and Hong Kong, he said.  Carniani is expected to double its sales within a year while the whole Richline International is seen boosting its business by 50 percent over the period thanks to organic growth and new acquisitions, Ulrich said.  Richline does not plan acquisitions of jewelry makers in Asia for now but aims to establish commercial relations there, he said.

124,BRKa,Warren Buffett picks another little-known successor,"NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Warren Buffett advanced his succession plan on Monday by naming Ted Weschler, a low-profile hedge fund manager who has produced out-sized returns in the last decade, to help manage the investments of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  Weschler, 50, will start at the company early next year and work with Todd Combs, who joined Berkshire last year, to manage its equity portfolios. Buffett, 81, has said he may also bring in a third manager, but meanwhile he continues to oversee the lion’s share of the company’s $52.36 billion in U.S. equities.  Weschler, like Combs before him, has succeeded while keeping a low profile far from the canyons of Wall Street.  The Charlottesville, Virginia-based money manager delivered total gains of 1,236 percent over the last 11 years, according to investors. Over the same period, Berkshire’s own Class B shares have risen 84 percent and the S&P 500 index has fallen nearly 23 percent.  As of June 30, Weschler’s Peninsula Capital Advisors had long positions in about $2 billion worth of stock, according to regulatory filings. Combs was managing about $400 million when he was hired.  Combs and Weschler appear to have different strengths, with Combs having focused more on financial stocks while Weschler appears to have favored communications-related picks. Bringing them together may work well, according to some experts.  “It seems they might complement one another,” said David Kass, a professor of finance at the University of Maryland who has studied Buffett and his work. “Weschler will bring diversification and expertise outside of the financial sector to Berkshire Hathaway.”  Since Combs started with Berkshire, Buffett has made clear there would be more people added to the investment team to eventually replace him. When and how many, however, have been open questions that have weighed on Berkshire’s stock, analysts following the stock have said. Some investors say Berkshire shares are currently at their most undervalued level in a generation.  A number of Buffett’s best-known biographers, as well as prominent fund managers including Mario Gabelli, told Reuters Insider they were not familiar with Weschler or his work. The same was true when Combs was appointed last year.  Moments after one of the biggest personnel mysteries in finance was lifted and Weschler was named as one of a likely trio of heirs to Buffett as managers of Berkshire’s investment portfolio, Weschler kept to his usual routine. He was at his desk at Peninsula — the hedge fund he founded in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1999 — dialing investors, his receptionist said.  Weschler’s interest in Buffett, who is both chief executive of the ice-cream-to-insurance conglomerate and its money manager, has been growing for some time.  According to journalist Carol Loomis, a long-time friend of and ghost-writer for Buffett, Weschler paid millions of dollars to dine with the “Oracle of Omaha” twice in the last two years.  Unlike many who bid in the annual charity auction of the lunch with Buffett — to benefit the anti-poverty group Glide — Weschler insisted on anonymity, wanting his name kept out of the headlines and requesting a change of venue from the New York steakhouse where the lunch is usually held. Weschler, who bid $2.63 million for the 2011 lunch, met Buffett on his home turf in Omaha.  In recent years, pressure has mounted on Buffett to put a succession plan in place for the day he will no longer run the company. Buffett’s roles of chief executive and investment manager will be split after he retires; the names on the CEO succession list are secret.  Weschler has overseen a very concentrated portfolio with DirecTV, DaVita, which runs kidney dialysis centers, and Liberty Media ranking among his biggest and most recent holdings.  In total, he held fewer than a dozen publicly traded U.S. stocks at the end of the second quarter, according to his most recent regulatory filing. He is not required to list stocks he may be shorting or otherwise betting against.  Weschler earned an undergraduate degree in economics from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, where Buffett began his own undergraduate education decades ago.  Before starting his stock-picking career in Virginia, Weschler worked at specialty chemicals and materials company W.R. Grace, where at one time he was assistant to the vice chairman.  The path for Weschler to join Berkshire was laid at this year’s lunch when Buffett pitched the idea of a move to Omaha, Buffett told Loomis. “I very much wanted him to do it, but I didn’t expect to get very far with the idea,” Buffett said.  “Ted will no doubt make a lot of money at Berkshire. But he was already making a lot of money with his fund — you can get an idea of that from the size of his (charity) bids — so money wasn’t a reason for him to come.”  In Charlottesville, a city one-quarter the size of Omaha, Weschler and his wife have supported a number of charities, from helping sponsor a youth film festival to donating to one that builds structures for communities in need.

The recommendations added to the three-month-old drama surrounding the deal, with Allied World and Transatlantic shareholders due to vote on Sept. 20.   As it stands, Allied’s offer is the smallest of three outstanding bids for Transatlantic, whose largest shareholder has said it will vote against the merger. [ID:nN1E77N1TM]   Allied World said it was disappointed that the proxy advisory firm, Institutional Shareholder Services, had recommended Transatlantic’s shareholders vote against the offer. Transatlantic said it too was disappointed.   Shares of Allied fell 0.5 percent to $51.66 in early trading, while Transatlantic fell 0.2 percent to $48.75.   At those prices the all-stock offer was worth $2.84 billion and stood at nearly a 7 percent discount to Transatlantic’s share price, valuing it at roughly two-thirds of book value.   There are two richer offers on the table for Transatlantic that complicate the Allied deal. Validus Holdings’s (VR.N) hostile cash-and-stock bid is worth $2.88 billion, while an all-cash unsolicited offer from Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) values Transatlantic at $3.25 billion.   Validus has taken its bid directly to shareholders, while Berkshire and Transatlantic have entered into a confidentiality agreement and opened talks on an offer.

Institutional Shareholder Services, the largest proxy advisory firm, said in a statement dated 9 September that the emergence of two higher competing bids from Validus Holdings Ltd  and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), as well as a lack of any market check, has “cast doubt on whether the deal with Allied World is truly the best economic option available to its shareholders.”	   Transatlantic is seeking shareholder approval for a merger with Allied World in which shareholders would receive 0.88 Allied World shares per Transatlantic share held.

129,BRKa,GE to buy back Buffett's financial crisis stake,"(Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) said on Tuesday it would buy back Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s (BRKa.N) preferred stake in the largest U.S. conglomerate, handing back a lifeline it grabbed during the 2008 financial crisis.  The company said in a regulatory filing it would pay $3.3 billion, plus unpaid dividends, to cash in famed U.S. investor Warren Buffett’s stake, which paid a 10 percent dividend. The redemption date has been set for October 17.  With the long-awaited move, GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt will aim to close one of the most difficult chapters in the company’s history, when trouble at its GE Capital finance arm threatened to take down the entire company.  Buffett bought his preferred stake in GE in October 2008, just a week after taking a $5 billion preferred stake in Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N). The investments were intended to signal his confidence in two storied U.S. companies during a financial crisis he likened to an “economic Pearl Harbor.”  That vote of confidence came at a price: GE will have paid Berkshire nearly $1 billion in dividends over the life of the investment.  In his annual investor letter earlier this year, Buffett lamented the likelihood that GE would redeem the shares, saying it would be an “unwelcome” event that would hurt Berkshire’s earnings power.  GE shares fell 3 percent to $14.95 in after-hours trading. Berkshire shares were unchanged.

133,BRKa,How to play it: Investing in cost-cutting banks,"THE ISSUE: As global economic growth slows, the biggest banks are shedding jobs, exiting businesses and scrambling for new sources of income. The question is: Is it time to jump into banking stocks and bonds? If so, how?  By Jennifer Ablan and Dan Wilchins  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three years after the financial crisis slammed the global financial system, banks are still trying to put tough times behind.  An aggressive new round of job reductions should lower costs and help the bottom line. Major banks have recently announced they are eliminating some 100,000 jobs.  But while some may see the moves as a way for banks to boost profitability, others are looking at it as yet another sign of dire prospects.  Is it time to be a bargain hunter in bank stocks, or to cut losses in the sector? Here are possible investment ideas for the leaner, meaner banking environment:  Bank of America, is attractive to some value investors because even with its problems it is still generating fairly strong earnings of about $5 billion to $5.5 billion per quarter.  But the bank is widely seen as needing to boost its capital to meet new global regulations. On top of that, it faces legal claims for losses on mortgage backed securities that it issued. Some of acquisitions also face big claims.  Bank of America hopes to raise capital by earning money and selling assets. The bank’s game plan can likely take it where it needs to go, said Charlie Peabody, a veteran bank analyst at independent research firm Portales Partners.  But in the end much depends on how much time regulators and the market give the bank to raise more capital. Already Bank of America raised $5 billion from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway in a deal made last month.  Peabody said that the better bet for investors looking to buy an individual stock is to buy top-performing JPMorgan Chase & Co,. The market selloff has made the stock fairly cheap, and the bank has fewer capital needs compared with Bank of America. The fear is that if banks need to issue more shares to raise capital, the stocks will suffer from dilution.  Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, isn’t so hot on Wall Street’s one-time money machine Goldman Sachs.  Staite said the largest U.S. investment bank could have about $1.6 billion of paper losses in its investment and lending division in the third quarter, with $400 million of that coming from the bank’s holdings of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd and $1.2 billion coming from its $15 billion private-equity investments.  He cut his third-quarter earnings estimate for Goldman to 7 cents a share from $2.96 a share and his price target on Goldman’s stock by $15 to $140.  The price target is about 1.1 times his estimated tangible book value for the company, a multiple that makes sense given his expectations for a return on tangible equity of about 12 percent, Staite said. The bank’s shares traded at $104.09 on Tuesday afternoon.  Staite is a five-star analyst who ranks first among 23 peers covering Goldman, according to Starmine.  Some hedge fund traders are altogether “shorting” the entire banking sector, arguing that the third quarter’s operating environment will be challenging.  They note that persistent volatility in the U.S. and European equity and credit markets and declining global growth expectations will add to the selling pressure in banking shares. Since June 30, global equity markets have declined 12 percent, credit spreads have widened sharply (200 basis points for high-yield “junk” bonds) and both foreign-exchange and interest rates have experienced higher volatility.  All combined, hedge funds say it should be no surprise to investors that the third quarter will be a very weak capital markets quarter.  Other investors are bypassing bank shares and instead looking to their corporate bonds.  Mark Kiesel, the global head of corporate bond management at PIMCO, said he favors the corporate credits of global banks, particularly U.S. banks, where conditions for the sector are improving. And global banks are no longer taking on enormous leverage, which augurs well for credit quality.  “Economic growth in the developed world will likely be below trend due to continued deleveraging of stressed public and private sector balance sheets,” he said.  What’s more, global banking regulators “are likely to make banks and financial institutions safer by requiring more capital and liquidity buffers,” Kiesel said.  Other technical factors provide a reason to believe the corporate credits of global banks will outperform, he added. “Bank and financial credit spreads remain attractive relative to industrial credit spreads,” Kiesel said. “  While the U.S. industrial sector could be more vulnerable to a below-trend economic environment and may also entertain more shareholder-friendly activities, U.S. banks remain focused on a longer-term, secular deleveraging trend and are set to continue to strengthen balance sheets due to heightened regulations.”",9132011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-banks-howtoplayit/how-to-play-it-investing-in-cost-cutting-banks-idUSTRE78C6L620110913

136,BRKa,Validus files to replace Transatlantic board,"(Reuters) - Reinsurer Validus Holdings (VR.N) increased the pressure on its target Transatlantic Holdings TRH.N on Wednesday, filing paperwork with regulators to ultimately replace Transatlantic’s board of directors.  Transatlantic shareholders are due to vote next Tuesday on an all-stock offer from Allied World AWH.N, which three proxy advisory firms have recommended they reject. Transatlantic’s largest shareholder also opposes the deal, and an Allied executive said this week the deal was unlikely to succeed.  Against that backdrop, Validus said Wednesday it had filed a preliminary consent solicitation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, seeking written permission from Transatlantic investors to remove and replace the board.  The three proposed new directors are Raymond Groth, a professor at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University and retired investment banker; former Canadian pension executive Paul Haggis; and financial services industry consultant Thomas Wajnert.  The battle for Transatlantic has been highly contentious, with multiple lawsuits and accusations of misbehavior on all sides. Transatlantic and Allied agreed to a deal in June, and Validus stepped in with its offer a month later.  New York-based Transatlantic, which was controlled by AIG until 2009, has a concentration in “long-tail” lines of insurance, like medical malpractice and workers compensation, where claims can take years to develop. That has been seen as an attractive addition for reinsurers that are more heavily exposed to “short-tail” risk like natural disasters.  Validus shares rose 0.6 percent and Transatlantic’s shares rose 0.1 percent in early trading, while Allied shares were flat. At current levels, Allied’s bid is worth $2.92 billion and Validus’ is worth $2.97 billion.  Meanwhile, little is known about the state of Transatlantic’s talks with Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), which made an unsolicited all-cash bid as well. That offer is worth $3.25 billion, and the two sides have been negotiating after signing a confidentiality agreement.

138,BRKa,"GE's Immelt sees ""decent"" U.S. economic growth","NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said he sees “good, decent economic growth everywhere,” including the United States, and is not worried about the economy slipping back into recession.  Immelt spoke to reporters in New York on Thursday ahead of an event at which the largest U.S. conglomerate announced new investments in cancer research.  Asked whether he was worried about recession, Immelt answered, “No. Just because I see good, decent economic growth everywhere. Decent in the U.S., fairly good outside the U.S.”  Immelt, a top adviser to the Obama administration on the economy and jobs, said the president’s jobs council, which he chairs, would next present proposals that focus on small businesses and entrepreneurs.  He also addressed GE’s plans to buy back the preferred shares it sold to investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) during the financial crisis. The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company on Tuesday said it would redeem the shares for $3.3 billion, plus unpaid dividends, on October 17.  “It was good when we did it, it was good when we exited,” Immelt said of the shares, which GE issued at a time when it needed to raise cash to protect its GE Capital finance arm.  GE shares, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, were up 2.7 percent in afternoon trading at $16.07.  Though Immelt did not elaborate why he felt U.S. economic growth was decent, his comments square with those from other U.S. business leaders in recent days.  United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) said on Thursday it was on track for record earnings this year. Its chief financial officer, Kurt Kuehn, said the U.S. economy would return to pre-recession growth levels within a year to 18 months.  Engine maker Cummins Inc (CMI.N) said this week North American construction markets are still weak but that the truck market is recovering, and said it would more than double its overall sales from 2010 to 2015.  The confidence of executives at major U.S. industrial and transportation companies may indicate companies are becoming more comfortable managing in times of volatile markets and muted investor confidence.  Speaking to investors in New York on Tuesday, Cummins Chief Operating Officer Tom Linebarger said the company “has demonstrated increased resilience to volatility.”  UPS shares were down 0.2 percent in afternoon trading at $66.02 while Cummins shares were up 3.6 percent at $97.55, both on the New York Stock Exchange.  Immelt spoke at an event to unveil a pair of investments in cancer research. GE said it would invest $1 billion over five years in research and development for cancer detection and treatment technology, with an initial emphasis on breast cancer.  “Competitively it’s very important,” said GE Healthcare Chief Executive John Dineen, who added that GE has used acquisitions to move into new areas of medical diagnostics.  “The world of diagnostics is going beyond traditional radiology into molecular diagnostics and personalized medicine, particularly in the case of cancer. It’s a very heterogenous disease, it’s a very personal disease.”  Dineen also said healthcare institutions in the United States and in emerging markets continue to buy GE’s technology but said, “Europe is more challenged because they’re public healthcare systems.”  The conglomerate will also contribute $50 million to an open innovation challenge, with another initial $50 million coming from venture capital partners. The program aims to identify and market new ideas for diagnosing breast cancer.  GE’s venture capital partners include Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Venrock, Mohr Davidow and MPM Capital.  The challenge is similar to one introduced last year to fund promising technologies related to a smart electrical grid. GE and its partners have said they would provide about $200 million in funding for start-ups working on commercial products to reduce energy use.

140,BRKa,"Allied World, Transatlantic call off deal","(Reuters) - Reinsurers Allied World Assurance Co Holdings Ltd and Transatlantic Holdings Inc called off their merger on Friday in the face of overwhelming opposition, and Transatlantic indicated it might remain independent despite two higher offers on the table.  Five days after telling shareholders to accept Allied World’s all-stock offer of about $47 per share, Transatlantic said it would be a disservice to them to accept a $52-a-share cash offer from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.  A person familiar with the situation said the difference between the two was a potential upside with the Allied deal — shareholders had the chance to benefit from future gains. However, Berkshire would buy them out at a discount and left no potential for returns down the road.  Transatlantic was controlled by insurer AIG until 2009, when AIG reduced its stake in an effort to raise capital following a U.S. government bailout.  The New York-based company has been attractive to competitors because of its depressed valuation. It also offers reinsurers, with heavy exposure to short-term risks like natural disasters, more exposure to longer-term lines of business like medical malpractice and workers’ compensation.  BREAK-UP FEES  The failure of the Allied deal had been expected for days, after three proxy advisory firms said Transatlantic shareholders should reject the offer. Earlier this week, an Allied executive told a Barclays Capital conference the deal was unlikely to succeed.  Allied World said in a statement it would receive a $35 million break-up fee and $13.3 million in expenses from Transatlantic. Transatlantic would owe Allied another $66.7 million if it entered into another deal within a year.  Allied World’s all-stock offer was worth $2.94 billion, or $47.05 a share, at Thursday’s closing prices and represented a roughly 5 percent discount to Transatlantic’s share price. Shareholders were due to vote on the agreement on Tuesday.  Transatlantic sent a letter to stockholders Friday, noting “it will continue to entertain and evaluate any serious proposal or opportunity that offers its stockholders full and fair value.”  But it said the Berkshire offer “would not deliver fair value to stockholders,” and that Berkshire had been unwilling as recently as last Friday to discuss raising its bid.  Transatlantic has also rejected a cash-and-stock offer from Validus Holdings, which took its bid directly to shareholders in late July. Since then, the companies have sued each other and Validus has filed to remove and replace Transatlantic’s board.  In response to the end of the Allied deal, Validus said it welcomed “the opportunity to enter into discussions (with Transatlantic) without any restrictive preconditions.”  On the New York Stock Exchange, Transatlantic fell 3 percent, Allied rose 3.3 percent and Validus fell 2.6 percent early Friday afternoon.  At Thursday’s closing prices, the Validus deal is worth $48.26 a share, or $3.02 billion. The Berkshire offer is worth $3.25 billion.  But both put Transatlantic at a substantial discount to book value — 0.71 times from Validus and 0.77 times from Berkshire. The property and casualty insurance and reinsurance sector has a median value of 0.84 times book, according to Thomson Reuters data.  In the interim, Transatlantic said it will increase its stock buyback program to $600 million, with a commitment to buy back half of that this year.  Davis Selected Advisors, Transatlantic’s largest shareholder, endorsed both moves.  “Davis Advisors applauds Transatlantic’s efforts to create value for shareholders with an intelligent capital management plan while at the same time remaining open to other strategic alternatives,” it said in the company’s statement.  Transatlantic also said Chief Executive Robert Orlich would retire as planned and that chief operating officer Michael Sapnar would become CEO as of January 1, 2012.  Transatlantic also released preliminary results for the third quarter on Friday, saying it expected to report earnings per share of 85 cents to $1.15 for the quarter. That is less than the lowest of seven analysts’ estimates for earnings compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

144,BRKa,"Factbox: What's on Obama's tax list, besides ""Buffett tax""?","(Reuters) - President Barack Obama is expected to make a raft of recommendations for changing tax law on Monday, in addition to his new proposed tax on the rich — known as the “Buffett tax” after billionaire Warren Buffett — which was disclosed on Saturday.  Obama, in a White House talk, will make his recommendations to the U.S. Congress “super committee” that is trying to find by November 23 at least $1.2 trillion in new budget savings over 10 years. That would be on top $917 billion in 10-year deficit reduction agreed to in an August deal to raise the debt limit.  The U.S. budget deficit in 2011 is expected to be about $1.3 trillion. The national debt stands at $14.7 trillion.  Here are some of the tax measures Obama has either already proposed, or may be looking at, to raise more tax revenue to help reduce the deficit, according to analysts:  * The president wants a new tax on the rich, known as the “Buffett tax.” Details were sketchy, but uber-investor Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, in mid-August made his own tax proposal. If Obama’s recommendation resembles the Buffett plan, then it would look like this:  —Hold income taxes steady for more than 99 percent of U.S. taxpayers.

146,BRKa,"Factbox: What's on Obama's tax list, with ""Buffett rule""?","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama is recommending a long list of tax law changes, including a proposed new minimum tax on millionaires he termed the “Buffett rule,” named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett.  Obama’s wide-ranging tax and budget proposals, introduced on Monday, immediately drew criticism from Republicans. The proposals will be delivered to a congressional “super committee” that is trying to find by November 23 at least $1.2 trillion in budget savings over the next 10 years.  Some of the ideas represent a principled attempt to reform the tax code, which has not been thoroughly overhauled in 25 years. Some of the proposals are largely attempts to boost government revenue with new fees and stricter oversight.  The U.S. budget deficit in 2011 is expected to be about $1.3 trillion; the national debt is $14.7 trillion. Addressing these problems requires spending and tax changes, experts say.  Here are some of the tax measures Obama has proposed.  * BUFFETT RULE. The president wants a new, minimum tax on millionaires, to be known as the “Buffett rule.” This idea is supported by Buffett, chairman of the conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway. The rule would ensure that people making more than $1 million a year should pay at least the same share of their income in taxes as middle-class families pay.  * BUSH TAX CUTS. Deep tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003 would be allowed to expire at the end of 2012 for households making more than $250,000 a year.  * ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS CAP. A limit on the value of itemized tax deductions and exemptions for individuals earning more than $200,000 a year and families earning more than $250,000, that would ensure those higher-earning taxpayers get the same benefit as someone in the 28 percent tax bracket. The cap would apply to popular itemized deductions including mortgage interest and charitable donations, foreign excluded income, tax-exempt interest, employer-sponsored health insurance and other items.  * PAYROLL TAX CUTS. Reductions in the payroll tax, which include Social Security deductions, would be extended. Employers’ taxes would be cut in half to 3.1 percent on the first $5 million in payroll. Employees’ payroll taxes would be cut in half to 3.1 percent next year.  * CARRIED INTEREST. Hedge fund and private equity managers would have to pay the 35-percent ordinary income tax rate, instead of the 15-percent capital gains tax rate, on a big chunk of their annual earnings, known as “carried interest.”  * OVERSEAS CORPORATE PROFITS. A range of tax-avoidance strategies would be targeted. Corporations could no longer deduct interest expenses on foreign earnings with deferred income taxes. These deductions would have to be deferred, as well. Foreign tax credits from dividends paid to a parent company by a foreign subsidiary would have to be determined on a pooling basis, not individually. Excessive shifting of corporate income into low-tax countries would be taxed more strictly. Earnings stripping by foreign entities would be curtailed.  * BUSINESS WRITE-OFFS. Companies could continue to write off 100 percent of the expense of buying new capital equipment.  * HIRING INCENTIVES. Firms could get up to $50 million in payroll tax refunds on new hires and wage increases, as well as tax breaks for hiring the long-term unemployed and veterans.  * OIL AND GAS SUBSIDIES. Several tax subsidies for the energy industry would be repealed, including the oil and gas well depletion allowance; the domestic manufacturing deduction on oil and gas production; expensing of intangible drilling costs; the tertiary recovery cost deduction; and others.  * OIL AND GAS R&D. This federal subsidy for research and development of oil and gas technologies would be ended.  * OIL & GAS LEASES. A $4 per acre fee would be put on non-producing oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters.  * LIFO ACCOUNTING. The last in, first out method of accounting for inventories — widely used by oil and gas companies to lower their tax bills — would be repealed.  * LCM ACCOUNTING. The lower-of-cost-or-market method of inventory accounting would be repealed.  * COAL SUBSIDIES. Some tax preferences for coal mining would end, including expensing of exploration and development costs, hard mineral fossil fuel depletion, capital gains treatment for royalties and the claiming of the domestic manufacturing deduction for coal production.  * FANNIE, FREDDIE G-FEES. The fees that government mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac charge lenders to guarantee repayment of new loans would rise by one-tenth of 1 percent at first, and by more later.  * LIFE INSURANCE. Taxation of life insurance contracts as well as the handling of dividends-received deductions and interest expense by life insurers would be made stricter.  * DUAL CAPACITY TAXPAYERS. Foreign tax credit rules would be tightened for certain taxpayers that pay tax in a foreign country while also getting an economic benefit from that country.  * AIRLINE FEES. The fee paid by airline passengers for aviation security would be set at $5 per one-way trip and rise 50 cents a year from 2013 to 2017. A new, $100-per-flight air traffic services fee would be imposed on airlines.  * BANK TAX. A “financial crisis responsibility fee” will be imposed on financial firms with assets exceeding $50 billion.  * PESTICIDE, CHEMICAL, HAZARDOUS WASTE FEES. Government fees charged to companies registering pesticides and chemicals and transporting hazardous wastes would go up.  * NUCLEAR PLANT DECOMMISSIONING FEES. Federal charges to power utilities for shutting down nuclear plants would rise.  * SUPERFUND TAXES. Taxes to fund the clean-up of the worst hazardous waste dumps would be reinstated.  * CORPORATE JETS. An accelerated depreciation tax break for corporate jet owners would be repealed.  * UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SURTAX. A federal tax on employers for unemployment insurance would rise.

148,BRKa,UPDATE 1-Montana court approves asbestos deal," * $43 million settlement with miners and their families   * State sued after W.R. Grace sought bankruptcy protection   * About 1,400 people to receive payments  (Adds details on lawsuit, settlement payments, byline, dateline)   By Laura Zuckerman   SALMON, Idaho, Sept 19 (Reuters) - A Montana judge has approved a $43 million settlement for people sickened by exposure to asbestos from a mine, with a large part of that amount to be paid by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), court documents show.   The settlement resolves a lawsuit filed against Montana over asbestos exposure at a W.R. Grace mine. Former miners and their families had accused the state of failing to properly oversee the mine or warn workers of dangers there.   The mine in Libby, Montana, produced vermiculite, used for home insulation, potting soil conditioner and absorbent packing material.   More than 70 percent of the vermiculite used in the country over eight decades came from Libby — and it was all contaminated by asbestos deposits in the same mine, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.   Miners originally sued W.R. Grace over their exposure to asbestos, but after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2001 the workers sued the state for failing to adequately protect them, according to court documents.   About 1,400 people will receive payouts from the settlement approved Sept. 8 by Montana District Court Judge Jeffrey M. Sherlock, ending a decade-long legal battle.   The deal ends numerous cases and claims against Montana “but expressly reserves their claims against all other responsible parties,” according to the agreement.   Many of the victims of asbestos exposure from the Libby mine are now over 65, and others have since died of asbestos-related diseases such as asbestosis and cancers like mesothelioma, records show.   Because of the decades-long latency associated with asbestos-related diseases, people continue to be diagnosed decades after the mine closed, according to federal health officials.   Montana officials conducted inspections of the mine in the 1950s and later years, but despite knowing the risk to miners from asbestos dust, the state did not adequately warn workers of those dangers, the Montana Supreme Court found in 2004.   To cover the $43 million settlement, the state of Montana is using $26.8 million out of its self-insurance fund.   Montana’s insurers, National Indemnity, Berkshire’s reinsurance unit, and Montana Insurance Guaranty Association will pay $16.1 million and $100,000 respectively, according to court documents.   Warren Buffet’s Berkshire has been active in taking over asbestos obligations from insurance companies in exchange for huge up-front premiums.   Payments for victims range from $500 to nearly $61,000 each, legal records show.   In a separate order on Sept. 8, Sherlock ordered one-third — or $14.3 million — to be paid out of the $43 million to attorneys for the victims, who worked on contingency.   The W.R. Grace mine in Libby closed in 1990.   In 2008, the company agreed to set up a trust fund to pay victims’ health claims.   Attorneys for the victims and for Montana did not respond to requests for comment.

Transatlantic shares fell 1.7 percent, as the Berkshire rejection left only one — hostile — suitor at the table.  Transatlantic and Allied World Assurance Co Holdings Ltd AWH.N called off their planned merger last Friday in the face of overwhelming opposition.  After that announcement, Berkshire reinsurance chief Ajit Jain sent Transatlantic a letter reiterating the offer his National Indemnity unit made in early August. The two sides had already been in talks, though not in recent days, under the terms of a confidentiality agreement.  The renewed offer, worth $3.25 billion, expires at the close of business Monday, and there appeared to be little chance Transatlantic would accept it. Berkshire said it would not renew its offer if it was not accepted by the deadline.  “The Transatlantic board of directors believes that selling Transatlantic for cash at the substantial discount to book value represented by the National Indemnity proposal simply would not deliver fair value to its stockholders,” Transatlantic said in a statement on Monday.  Transatlantic said last Friday it expects its book value at the end of the third quarter to be $69 to $70 a share. In a presentation to investors, a copy of which it filed with securities regulators Monday, Transatlantic said the Berkshire offer undervalued it by any of seven different metrics used in insurance M&A deals.  A hostile offer for the company remains on the table from Validus Holdings (VR.N). Validus has taken its offer directly to Transatlantic shareholders and has taken steps to replace Transatlantic’s board.  Transatlantic on Friday said it would be open to friendly negotiations with Validus if the companies could come to terms on a confidentiality agreement.

A hostile offer for the company remains on the table from Validus Holdings (VR.N). Validus has taken its offer directly to Transatlantic shareholders and has taken steps to replace Transatlantic’s board.   Transatlantic on Friday said it would be open to friendly negotiations with Validus if the companies could come to terms on a confidentiality agreement. Monday’s investor presentation included four pages of arguments from Transatlantic as to why it could not accept Validus’s current offer.   Validus shares fell 1.9 percent to $24.84 in late-morning trading.

154,BRKa,Montana court approves key asbestos deal: reports,"(Reuters) - A Montana court has approved a $43 million settlement for people who were sickened by asbestos exposure from a former W.R. Grace mine, with a large part of the settlement to be paid by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, local papers reported.  The mine in Libby, Montana, produced vermiculite, which was popular in home insulation. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, more than 70 percent of the vermiculite used in the country over eight decades came from Libby — and it was all contaminated by asbestos deposits in the same mine.  According to multiple Montana newspapers, more than 1,300 people will receive payouts from the settlement approved Friday, ending a decade-long legal battle.  Most are now over 65 and many suffer from the lung disease asbestosis as a result of their exposure, the reports said. Because of the extremely long latency associated with asbestos-related diseases, people continue to be diagnosed decades after the mine closed.  National Indemnity, Berkshire’s reinsurance unit, will pay about 40 percent of the settlement, the papers said. Berkshire has been active in taking over asbestos obligations from insurance companies in exchange for huge up-front premiums.

157,BRKa,Soros joins Forbes top 10 U.S. billionaires list,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investor George Soros, at 81, has for the first time made the list of the 10 wealthiest Americans, Forbes Magazine reported on Wednesday in the 2011 edition of its annual rich list.  Less surprising, Bill Gates again topped the list with a net worth of $59 billion, up $5 billion. The Microsoft founder has been the wealthiest American every year since 1994.  Everyone in the top 20 saw their wealth rise in the past year with the exception of investor Warren Buffett, whose fortune fell by $6 billion to $39 billion as the value of his shares in Berkshire Hathaway dropped.  Buffett has urged U.S. President Barack Obama to tax millionaires more and has pledged to give away 99 percent of his fortune to philanthropic causes.  Coming in at No. 7, Soros had a fortune of $22 billion after adding $7.8 billion to his net worth thanks to investments in gold and related securities as well as equities. Soros switched to cash in the spring, allowing him to preserve his gains and miss market turmoil caused by the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.  This summer, Soros announced he would close his hedge fund and give money back to outside investors, focusing on managing investments for himself and his family instead.  Forbes said hedge funds are notoriously secretive and that after he shut his fund, Soros shared more information with the magazine about his wealth.  “We always thought we were low on our estimates of him, but this time we had more details bringing him to No. 7,” said Forbes Senior Wealth Editor Luisa Kroll.  Buffet was No. 2 and his declining fortune came as his Berkshire Hathaway stock fell by 9 percent between August 25, 2010, and August 26, 2011, when Forbes compiled its data.  “He is also the most generous billionaire,” Kroll said of Buffett, noting that $3 billion of his decline could be attributed to charitable contributions.  The Forbes list comes as Obama has proposed higher taxes on millionaires so they pay at least the same rate as middle-class Americans, something he called the “Buffett rule.”  Unlike Buffett, Tea Party backers David and Charles Koch want Washington to tax them less as their cash pile increases. The brothers’ wealth from conglomerate Koch Industries pushed them into fourth place with $25 billion each, each up $3.5 billion from last year.  In No. 3 was Oracle founder Larry Ellison, whose wealth increased $6 billion to $33 billion.  Christy Walton, heir to Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton’s fortune, dropped to sixth place at $24.5 billion despite a $500 million increase in wealth.  Casino owner Sheldon Adelson was in eighth place with a fortune of $21.5 billion, up $6.8 billion.  Jim and Alice Walton, also of the Wal-Mart family, were ninth and 10th at $21.1 billion and $20.9 billion respectively.

160,BRKa,Credit reporting firm TransUnion for sale: sources,"(Reuters) - TransUnion’s owners are pursuing a possible sale that could fetch roughly $2 billion for the credit information firm, sources familiar with the matter said.  TransUnion, which is owned by private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners and Chicago’s Pritzker family, said in July it planned to raise up to $325 million in an initial public offering.  But the Chicago-based company may instead be sold as the IPO market has effectively been shut amid geopolitical and economic uncertainty.  TransUnion is being advised by Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Bank of America (BAC.N) on the sale, the sources said.  Bidders for the business, which competes with firms like Experian (EXPN.L) and Equifax (EFX.N), include private equity firms, the sources said.  The auction is at an advanced stage, but the process has been hit by problems in the financing markets, which have seen the availability of debt available to private equity firms shrink and the interest rates go up, the sources said.  Private equity-backed deal volume in the third quarter was down nearly 30 percent to $53.1 billion from the same period of last year, according to Thomson Reuters data through September 22.  Dual-track processes, where both an IPO and an outright sale are explored, are often adopted by private equity firms trying to realize their investments in companies.  TransUnion and Bank of America were not immediately available for comment. Deutsche Bank and Madison Dearborn declined to comment.  Chicago-based Madison Dearborn bought a 51 percent stake in TransUnion last year from the Pritzkers, one of the wealthiest families in the United States.  The Pritzkers have been selling assets following a 2001 settlement agreement, under which 11 heirs set a plan to break up the family fortune.  In 2006, the family sold smokeless tobacco company Conwood to Reynolds American RAI.N for $3.5 billion.  That was followed in 2007 by the sale of 60 percent of manufacturing and services group Marmon Holdings Inc to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) for $4.5 billion.  Late in 2009, the family took Hyatt Hotels Corp (H.N) public.  Earlier this year, the Pritzkers sold a controlling interest in Triton Container International Ltd to Warburg Pincus WP.UL and Vestar Capital Partners for about $1 billion.

Transatlantic last week called off a merger with Allied World AWH.N in the face of overwhelming opposition. Earlier this week, it said it would not accept an unsolicited bid from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) either.   Validus made an unsolicited offer for Transatlantic in July, but after they failed to come to terms on a confidentiality pact, Validus took its offer to shareholders.   Since then, both companies have sued each other and Validus has taken steps to replace Transatlantic’s board. The companies have agreed to a standstill period to Oct. 31, during which they will not act on those lawsuits and Validus will not buy any more Transatlantic stock.   If Validus is successful in striking a deal, it would be the second time in two years it broke up a merger among peers. In 2009 it won a bidding war for reinsurer IPC, which initially had a friendly deal with Max Re.   Validus has said a deal with Transatlantic would make it the world’s sixth-largest reinsurer, a quick rise considering that the company was founded in October 2005.   At closing prices Friday, the cash-and-stock Validus offer was worth $2.80 billion, valuing Transatlantic at about two-thirds of book value.   Validus said that as of Thursday night, a total of 699 Transatlantic shares were tendered into its offer, or roughly one-one-thousandth of 1 percent of Transatlantic shares.

165,BRKa,FACTBOX-BofA races to sell assets," Sept 23 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp’s  (BAC.N) push to shed assets and build its capital base is in high gear.   The largest U.S. bank company is ridding itself of investments and businesses it considers “noncore” in order to raise cash and lower the asset base that determines its regulatory capital requirements. The deals range from significant dispositions such as its $8.6 billion Canadian credit card portfolio to more mundane divestitures, such as stock in a Pizza Hut franchisee.   In late August, the company staved off investor fears that it would be forced into a dilutive equity offering by lassoing a $5 billion investment from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. But concerns linger because the bank continues to battle billions of dollars of losses relating to residential mortgages and litigation, and faces tougher capital rules that will be phased in beginning in 2013.   Bank of America has announced some $46 billion of asset sales since 2010, including about $11 billion from shedding money management giant BlackRock (BLK.N), with the pace of deals accelerating in recent months.   The following have been announced, or reported to be on the block, since the start of this year:   February 3: Sells Balboa insurance portfolio for more than $700 million to Australia’s QBE Insurance. The sale contributed to a $3 billion capital raise that was a provision in its agreement to pay off U.S. government bailout aid.   April 2011: Sells its $200 million United Kingdom small-business loan portfolio to Barclays PLC. Terms were not disclosed, and a bank spokesman declined to give a specific date for the transaction.   May 19: Announces sale of its remaining stake in BlackRock for about $2.5 billion.   June 6: Sells a $1 billion credit card portfolio to Regions Financial Corp (RF.N). The deal comprised about 500,000 accounts of Regions customers that were serviced by Bank of America.   July 7: Sells Balboa Insurance’s life insurance division to St. Paul, Minnesota-based Securian Financial Group Inc. Terms were not disclosed.   August 3: Sells a credit card business in Spain to Apollo Capital Management. Terms were not disclosed.   August 5: Sells servicing rights on a pool of 400,000 mortgages to Fannie Mae. The purchase price on the loans that had unpaid principal of $73 billion was more than $500 million, the Wall Street Journal reported.   August 15: Agreed to sell an $8.6 billion credit card portfolio in Canada to TD Bank Group (TD.TO) for an undisclosed amount, and announcement of the possible sale of card businesses in the U.K. and Ireland.   August 25: Billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) buys $5 billion of preferred stock in a private offering. Berkshire also receives warrants to purchase up to 700 million common shares of Bank of America over the next decade at $7.14 per share.   August 29: Sells half of its stake in China Construction Bank for $8.3 billion.   September 15: Sells 80.8 million shares in hospital operator HCA Holdings Inc back to the company for about $1.5 billion. The bank has received roughly $3 billion in proceeds from the original $1 billion that Merrill Lynch & Co investment made in 2006. Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch (and its almost half-interest in BlackRock, in early 2009).   September 22: Reuters reports bank’s plan to sell almost $1 billion of performing and delinquent commercial real estate loans to an investor group including Invesco Ltd (IVZ.N) and Square Mile Capital Management. The loans are tied to 32 properties.   September 22: Bloomberg reports bank’s planned sale of a stake in NPC International, which operates the biggest Pizza Hut franchise in the United States, for more than $800 million.

167,BRKa,Berkshire to launch share buyback plan,"(Reuters) Warren Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway will launch a share buyback program, an unprecedented move from Buffett that comes after months of investor complaints that the stock is undervalued.  Buffett long balked at a buyback, saying he preferred using spare cash to buy companies that would increase his own company’s profit margins.  Yet some long-time investors have said Berkshire shares were lately at their cheapest in a generation, and even analysts who were cautious on the stock said it was attractively priced.  In his letter to shareholders last February, Buffett bragged that “not a dime of cash has left Berkshire for dividends or share repurchases during the past 40 years.” But Berkshire said on Monday it is willing to pay up to 10 percent more than book value for its stock.  “In the opinion of our board and management, the underlying businesses of Berkshire are worth considerably more than this amount, though any such estimate is necessarily imprecise,” Berkshire said in a statement. The buyback program will run indefinitely, the company said.  One long-time Buffett investor said the “Oracle of Omaha” was effectively buying two things cheaply — Berkshire as an operating company for a broad set of industrial and consumer businesses, and Berkshire as a portfolio of financial and other stocks that have been heavily sold of late.  “There’s just so much leverage right now, this is close to as good a setup as you might ever see, to be a domestic play in a land of people hating domestic, with double leverage,” said Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management in Seattle.  Berkshire Class A shares rose 8.1 percent to close at $108,449 — almost equal to the upper threshold of what Berkshire said it would pay for the shares, including the premium and based on last quarter’s book value. The more actively traded Class B shares rose 8.6 percent to $72.09. Last week both classes fell to their lowest point since early 2010.  The A shares are so expensive because Berkshire has never split them, choosing instead to let them appreciate over time. The B shares, which hold lesser voting rights, were split to help finance the takeover of railroad Burlington Northern.  The company said it would use cash on hand to fund the buybacks, but would not buy any shares if doing so took the company’s cash position below $20 billion.  Berkshire had $47.89 billion in cash as of June 30, but has spent at least $15 billion this quarter on acquisitions and investments, most notably the chemical company Lubrizol and a preferred stake in Bank of America.  As of June 30, Berkshire’s book value was $98,716 per Class A share, which would suggest the company would be willing to pay up to $108,588 per share in the buyback program.  If Berkshire spent $10 billion buying stock at a 10 percent premium, it could end up repurchasing nearly 10 percent of its Class A shares.  One investor said the timing of Berkshire’s announcement might be related to recent sharp market declines.  “One might argue that (Buffett) is making a statement about the overall market. Perhaps he thinks that the selling is excessive,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of investment manager YCMNET Advisors and a Berkshire holder.  A possible confirmation that Berkshire thinks the market is cheap is the recent take-it-or-leave-it offer for reinsurance company Transatlantic Holdings.  Though it was rebuffed, another Berkshire investor said it was fair to assume that Buffett remained in the market to buy companies at the right price, even with the potentially huge buyback coming.  “I don’t think he’s out of the acquisition market, ever,” said James Armstrong, president of investment adviser Henry H. Armstrong Associates in Pittsburgh. “Even if his cash runs down to the $20 billion cutoff, if another Lubrizol appears on the scene, he can fund that purchase by selling stock or other securities, or by borrowing.”  Other investors said the buyback was a sign that Berkshire’s relationship with investors was changing, which could portend even bigger changes down the road, like another idea often rejected by the 81-year-old Buffett — a dividend.  “Can he continue to experience a higher return on equity? If not, is a dividend in the future somewhere for the major shares? It might be that this company is turning into a slower-growth stock that generates high cash flow,” said John Augustine, chief investment strategist for Fifth Third Bank, which manages $25.6 billion and owns Berkshire shares.  The buyback is just the latest sea change at Berkshire, which is slowly transforming itself as Buffett ages and begins to look toward the future of the conglomerate.  That future has been at the forefront of investor thinking since early this year, when Buffett’s presumed heir apparent, David Sokol, left the company amid a scandal around his own personal investments in Lubrizol.  Berkshire has brought on two investment managers who will help run its portfolio after Buffett retires, and the board is believed to have a short-list of candidates who would succeed him as chief executive.  “Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett do really good analysis when they make investments in other companies, and you can be sure they know what they’re doing here,” said Michael Holland, founder of Holland & Co, who oversees more than $4 billion of assets and owns Berkshire shares.

172,BRKa,Transatlantic in talks with new bidder,"(Reuters) - Transatlantic Holdings Inc TRH.N said on Monday it entered into deal talks with an undisclosed bidder, adding a fresh twist in a months-long takeover saga and sending the reinsurer’s shares up sharply.  For nearly four months, Transatlantic has been the subject of a bidding war, as the former arm of American International Group Inc (AIG.N) balanced an agreed deal and at least two unsolicited offers.  Just last Friday, Transatlantic agreed to open talks with Validus Holdings Ltd (VR.N) after reaching agreement on a confidentiality pact with the Bermuda reinsurer, which has been pursuing a hostile bid.  That followed two other offers falling through in the last two weeks. Transatlantic called off a merger with Allied World Assurance Co Holdings Ltd AWH.N in the face of overwhelming opposition and, last week, it said it would not accept an unsolicited bid from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N).  Transatlantic has proven to be an attractive target; it is one of the cheapest companies in the industry and has long-tail insurance lines, such as medical malpractice and workers’ compensation, which are attractive to others more exposed to short-tail risks such as hurricane damage.  Transatlantic is trading at 0.71 times book value, which allows rivals to bid less than book and still offer a premium. Berkshire’s National Indemnity Co, for example, bid 0.77 times book value for Transatlantic.  Transatlantic shares rose 4.2 percent to $48.59 in midday trading. Equity analysts at Standard & Poor’s said the stock remained undervalued and should trade closer to the sector than it does now.  Analyst Cathy Seifert maintained a $58 price target, which would be roughly 0.83 times book, right around the industry median.  Experts have been anticipating deals, especially in Bermuda, where a combination of excess capital and a soft pricing environment make consolidation attractive.  Deals, however, have been relatively rare, in part because the “social question” — who will lead the combined company — is often not resolved.  Transatlantic removes that hurdle. Chief Executive Robert Orlich said in June he would retire after striking the Allied World deal, worth $3.2 billion at the time.  There has also been some hesitancy among Bermudan players to buy or sell because valuations are depressed across the sector. Companies are loathe to use their own depressed stock to buy another depressed stock, with little sign of valuation improving anytime soon.  New York-based Transatlantic did not disclose the identity of the latest bidder and said there was no assurance the discussions will result in a deal.

179,BRKa,"Buffett backs Bank of America, buying more stocks","(Reuters) - Warren Buffett said on Friday he is still eager to buy companies and stocks, even as his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway launches its first-ever share buyback program.  Buffett, in a CNBC interview, said the repurchases will not stop the company from making acquisitions or spending on infrastructure for its portfolio of companies.  The “Oracle of Omaha” also reiterated his support for Bank of America Corp even as he acknowledged it will take the bank time to solve its problems.  Buffett said Berkshire bought a net $4 billion of common stock on the market in the third quarter as sharp declines presented opportunities to invest cheaply.  But it is the investment in its own shares that stunned the market. Berkshire announced the program Monday, saying it would pay up to 10 percent above book value for stock. Investors said the program meant Berkshire was probably undervalued by 30 percent or more.  Buffett said the paperwork to start the buybacks was completed on Thursday.  Berkshire Class A shares were down 0.9 percent at $108,202 in afternoon trade on Friday, in line with broader market declines, though the stock is still up sharply from the pre-buyback levels of late last week.  BACKING BofA  While Berkshire has said it could spend heavily on shares, Buffett said on Friday the company would still make acquisitions and would end up spending $7 billion this year on plant and equipment for its portfolio of companies.  As he has all year long, he said such investments were a bet on the economic strength of the United States. “It’s very, very unlikely we’ll go back into a recession,” Buffett said.  That confidence was part of his reasoning for the deal with Bank of America, which gave him a lucrative dividend and a pile of unusually long-lasting warrants as well.  Bank of America is “a fabulous business, but it’s got a lot of problems from the past,” he said, acknowledging that CEO Brian Moynihan will need years to fix them.

181,BRKa,"WRAPUP-BofA shares drop, recover in rollercoaster day"," * Shares reverse losses, close up 4 percent   * Citigroup, Morgan Stanley also close up  (Please note paragraph 11 contains language that may be offensive to some readers)   By Rick Rothacker   CHARLOTTE, N.C., Oct 4 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) shares rose 4 percent on Tuesday after a senior European Union official’s comments on bank aid triggered a broader U.S. stock market recovery.   Shares of the largest U.S. bank by assets closed up 23 cents at $5.76, after being down as much as 5 percent on the New York Stock Exchange for much of the trading day.   The rise in bank stocks came after Olli Rehn, European commissioner for economic affairs, told the Financial Times that the European Union has an “increasingly shared view” that there needs to be some kind of coordinated approach to the European debt crisis, including aiding banks.   Any aid for European banks reduces uncertainty for U.S. banks and likely shields them from possible losses, said Jason Ware, market strategist for Albion Financial Group.   “What markets need right now is coordinated policy action in Europe, or at least the appearance of coordinated policy action,” said Ware.   The rapid share move also came after billionaire investor Warren Buffett told Reuters he was unconcerned about Bank of America’s share drop on Monday, in which shares closed below $6 per share for the first time since March 2009. [ID:nN1E7931OK]   Buffett purchased $5 billion in Bank of America preferred stock in late August, temporarily arresting the bank’s month long-share swoon.   “We agreed to hold it for at least five years, so what I’m thinking about is where Bank of America will be in five years, and nothing in the last 24 hours or 48 hours has changed my views on that,” the Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) chief executive told Reuters on the sidelines of Fortune magazine’s Most Powerful Women Summit.   The bank’s shares rallied late in the session but for much of the day they were lower, falling as much as 7.2 percent amid continuing uncertainty about Europe and the economy. Bank of America has also faced scrutiny for a plan to charge customers a new debit card fee and for ongoing problems with its web site.   “They are the No. 1 target,” said Frank Barkocy, director of research at Mendon Capital Advisors. “Everyone is beating the crap out of them, from Congress to regulators to the man on the street that sees them as the evil empire.”   Also on Tuesday, the bank announced plans to shutter its correspondent mortgage business after attempting to sell the unit for the last six weeks. [ID:nN1E7931Z6]   Bank of America shares have lost more than 50 percent of their value this year as investors have feared the bank will need to raise capital to absorb losses from the mortgage crisis.   The KBW Bank Index .BKX closed up 4.5 percent on Tuesday. Shares of Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which have also dropped in recent sessions, rose 5.5 percent and 12.3 percent, respectively.   The bank has also faced a backlash over its plan to charge customers $5 per month for debit card use and continuing problems with its online banking website.   On Tuesday, Sen. Richard Durbin, the author of a law limiting bank debit card processing fees, criticized Bank of America for its plan to add a new monthly fee for debit card use. Barkocy called Durbin’s comments “inappropriate,” saying the bank has a right to make up lost revenue.   The Illinois senator said competitors should poach customers from Bank of America because of the new fee.    “It means an opportunity for these banks and credit unions who I hope will treat their customers a lot better than Bank of America,” said Durbin. [ID:nN1E7930K7]   Meanwhile, Bank of America’s website carried a message Tuesday saying it was sorry the site was running slowly. Bank spokeswoman Tara Burke said the site was largely operating normally but the disclosure was posted as a precaution. The problems are not the result of hacking or malware, she said.   The bank told customers they could visit a branch or an automated teller machine instead of conducting business online.   The Charlotte, N.C., bank said in August that it planned to exit the correspondent mortgage business, in which it bought home loans originally made by other lenders. The bank will continue to make loans directly to retail customers.   Since taking over last year, Bank of America chief executive Brian Moynihan has been selling off business lines and shedding riskier operations as he looks to raise capital to cover mortgage losses and to meet new international capital standards.   The bank will transfer many of its 1,200 correspondent lending employees to other businesses, bank spokesman Rick Simon said. In a first step, about 100 employees in Westlake Village, Calif., will be moved during the week of Oct. 17 to the unit that handles troubled mortgage loans.   The bank’s correspondent lending employees are primarily based in Westlake Village; Tampa, Fla.; and Thousand Oaks, Calif.

182,BRKa,Exclusive: Buffett not worried by BofA share fall,"LAGUNA NIGUEL, California (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett is not concerned by the sharp drop in Bank of America Corp shares in the last couple of days, despite his $5 billion investment in the company last month, he told Reuters on Tuesday.  “We agreed to hold it for at least five years, so what I’m thinking about is where Bank of America will be in five years, and nothing in the last 24 hours or 48 hours has changed my views on that,” the Berkshire Hathaway Inc chief executive told Reuters on the sidelines of Fortune magazine’s Most Powerful Women Summit.  Buffett made his bet on Bank of America’s survival in late August (though it closed in early September). The deal gave him preferred shares with a hefty dividend and warrants that represent 6.5 percent of Bank of America stock.  Bank of America shares fell 5.2 percent to $5.24 in late-afternoon trading. The stock rose 33 percent in the five days after Buffett’s investment was announced but since that peak has now fallen 37 percent.  Earlier on Tuesday, Buffett told the Fortune summit that many of Berkshire Hathaway’s businesses would post record profits this year, including railroad unit Burlington Northern and energy business MidAmerican.  But he was much less optimistic about the company’s housing-related businesses, including Shaw Carpet and Acme Brick.  Buffett told his long-time friend Carol Loomis, who interviewed him in front of an audience of America’s most important female executives, that the performance of the housing-related units was as bad as it has ever been.

183,BRKa,Corporate America seeks cover in arms of small business,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Facing talk of “class warfare” in Washington and protest marches on Wall Street, some of the biggest players in corporate America are linking arms with small business in what observers see as moves to bolster their images at a time of rising public anger.  Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) Chief Executive Howard Schultz started the ball rolling on Monday with word that the world’s biggest coffee chain was donating $5 million to start a fund dedicated to lending money to small businesses and nonprofit organizations.  General Electric Co (GE.N), the largest U.S. conglomerate, will also tout the virtues of smaller businesses on Thursday when it hosts a meeting in Columbus, Ohio, to discuss how to encourage the growth of mid-sized companies.  Both companies, giants in their own industries, are throwing their weight behind beneficiaries who are generally better regarded in the public eye, in hopes of picking up some of their shine, experts contend.  “Small businesses, entrepreneurs are the corporate equivalent of dolphins. Everybody likes dolphins ... It’s a good group to associate with,” said Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business.  While associating with dolphins may make corporate leviathans seem cuter, it is unlikely to do much to boost the ailing U.S. economy, where unemployment has hovered near or above 9 percent for more than two years, observers said.  “It’s mostly a show. The only thing that is going to help the employment situation in the next two years is macroeconomic policy,” said Josh Bivens, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington think tank.  The moves come at a time of rising tensions over the heading of the U.S. economy. Last month, U.S. President Barack Obama unveiled a plan to raise taxes on people who make more than $1 million a year — a move he called the “Buffett rule” in honor of billionaire investor Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), who backed the idea.  Republican House Speaker John Boehner was quick to blast the idea, saying it amounted to “class warfare.”  Over the weekend, more than 700 anti-Wall Street protesters were arrested in New York after attempting an unauthorized march across the Brooklyn Bridge.  New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg warned in his weekly radio address that the demonstrations could lead to the sort of unrest seen during the so-called Arab Spring wave of protests in the Middle East.  “You don’t want those kinds of riots here,” Bloomberg said, according to media reports.  Amid this turmoil, both Starbucks’ Schultz, who grew up in public housing, and GE Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt, a Dartmouth College graduate, have stepped up their involvement on the political stage, though both deny any interest in running for office.  Immelt, a lifelong Republican, in January took the helm of a White House advisory board on the economy and job creation. He has taken flak this year for the company’s expected low tax rate, which GE attributes to losses at its finance arm.  GE, which has a hefty finance arm, did benefit from some of the federal programs set up during the credit crisis to back private debt. Starbucks, whose business is not in the financial sector, did not.  Before Schultz, a Democrat, unveiled his fund, to which Starbucks is encouraging customers to make $5 donations, he had already called on wealthy Americans and businesses to stop making campaign contributions to U.S. lawmakers until they found a “fair, bipartisan” deal on the nation’s debt, taxes and spending.  Small businesses say they are largely neglected by the nation’s largest banks, leaving many entrepreneurs to rely on personal borrowing, including credit cards and second mortgages, to fund their ventures. To that extent, they welcome attention from other sources of financing, whether they be Starbucks’ “Create Jobs for USA” fund or GE Capital.  “I don’t think the banks in the current regulatory environment have the flexibility to experiment, have the understanding of small business. Their focus is elsewhere,” said Marilyn Landis, a director and former chair of the National Small Business Association. “I don’t see the banks as being significant players any time soon.”  But even so, Landis is wary when big companies rush to embrace small businesses.  “We’re going to see lots of posturing, lots of grand opportunities,” she said. “The question is if any of them will be meaningful.”  Starbucks said its only interest in starting the fund is helping the neighborhoods where it sells its products.  “Let there be no mistake: Our concern is about the communities where we do business and where our partners, which is what we call our employees, live and work,” said Jim Olson, a spokesman for the Seattle-based chain, adding that Moody’s Analytics’ top analyst had backed the idea.  For its part, GE Capital said it is just trying to promote the interests of companies to which it lends.  “It’s our customer base,” said spokesman Russell Wilkerson. “Sure, we have a vested interest here in seeing them do well.”  While companies like GE and Starbucks focus on programs that they contend can help with social ills, it is unlikely their overall actions are going to be any different from those of any major publicly traded corporation, one observer said.",10042011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-corporate-image/corporate-america-seeks-cover-in-arms-of-small-business-idUSTRE79365520111004

187,BRKa,"Buy or Sell: For Allied World, is no deal a better deal?","(Reuters) - Allied World Assurance Co Holdings Ltd’s AWH.N withdrawal from a bidding race for Transatlantic Holdings TRH.N may have cost it the chance to beef up its portfolio, but a nimbler Allied may be better able to navigate choppy markets.  Zurich-based Allied’s stock has fallen about 7 percent since it first bid for Transatlantic in mid-June. Its shares currently trade at a 33 percent discount to their book value.  Most insurers are battling pricing pressures and sluggish growth in new business, and some analysts reckon Allied’s rivals may be a better investment.  Allied World has among the highest return-on-equity and book-value growth among its peers, noted Dean Evans, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. “That’s something being overlooked by the market in terms of the valuation of their shares.”  Allied currently trades 21 percent below its mean price target of $68.38, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data.  “The stock is ridiculously undervalued,” said Jay Kaplan, a fund manager for Royce Total Return Fund. “It would probably buy back a ton of its shares.”  Allied had about $201 million left in a buyback program at the end of the second quarter, and is expected to resume buying back its shares this quarter.  “They definitely have available cash to use, but I expect they’d wait until after the Atlantic hurricane season to really do anything substantial,” said KBW’s Evans, referring to a likely end-November timeframe.  Termination fees from the Transatlantic non-deal should add more than $1 per share to Allied’s earnings — another positive for its stock. Allied would receive a $35 million break-up fee and $13.3 million in costs from Transatlantic.  Reinsurer Transatlantic, once controlled by American International Group Inc (AIG.N) and also recently courted by Validus Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s (BRKa.N) National Indemnity, would also owe Allied another $66.7 million if it enters another deal within a year.  The insurance market has been battling sluggish growth and price weakness since the 2008 financial crisis.  Allied World, whose reinsurance operations make up around a third of its revenue from gross premiums, would benefit from any price hikes — but analysts see larger players like ACE ACE.N and XL Group (XL.N) benefiting more.  “ACE and XL screen best here because both have flexible and robust property-catastrophe platforms, which can directly benefit from better pricing,” said Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Nannizzi.  In addition, any gains from new business that Allied may win could be offset by the high losses from catastrophe this year such as the Japan and New Zealand earthquakes, flooding in Australia and blizzards and hurricanes in the United States.  “The rebound in underwriting and operating margins expected for 2012 is skewed by a high level of catastrophe losses incurred so far in 2011,” said Standard & Poor’s equity analyst Cathy Seifert.

191,BRKa,U.S. government seen intervening in rail dispute,"   * White House action would prevent strike  * Failed talks affect more than 80,000 freight rail workers  * Locomotive engineers authorized strike beginning Friday   WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - The White House was expected to intervene on Thursday in stalled contract negotiations at the largest U.S. freight railroads and head off a potential strike by thousands of locomotive engineers.   Talks between 11 unions representing more than 80,000 workers and a group overseeing negotiations for CSX Corp CSX.N, Norfolk Southern (NSC.N), Union Pacific (UNP.N) and Burlington Northern Santa Fe — owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) — faltered in September.   More than two dozen smaller railroads are also involved in the negotiations.   Government intervention is permitted under federal law in railroad and airline disputes if an impasse or a potential strike is considered damaging to commerce.   The National Mediation Board has overseen rail talks for more than a year and has already notified the White House that mediation has failed.   That cleared the way for possible union strikes at 12:01 a.m. EDT on Friday unless the Obama administration acts to head them off.   The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, representing nearly 25,000 workers, is the only major union to have authorized a walkout.   Robert Scardelletti, president of the Transportation Communications Union, told his members in a letter this week that the group “was certain that President Obama” would intervene.   Railroads also expect the White House to step in and create an emergency board to review the dispute and recommend a settlement.   The White House had no immediate comment.

A person familiar with the situation confirmed that the bidder is Bermuda-based Enstar Group , which buys insurers that are no longer writing new business. Insurers in “run-off” only manage existing policies, collecting premiums and paying claims. Industry trade website Insurance Insider had previously reported that Enstar was bidding with the backing of one of its largest shareholders, hedge fund manager J. Christopher Flowers. Earlier this year, Enstar raised capital by selling nearly a 20 percent economic interest in itself to Goldman Sachs’ private equity arm GS Capital Partners. Goldman is also the financial adviser to Transatlantic in its sale process. Transatlantic is already in discussions with Validus Holdings Ltd , Berkshire Hathaway unit National Indemnity Co and an additional undisclosed party. Last month, Reuters reported that a former Berkshire insurance executive, Joseph Brandon, was working with Morgan Stanley on a possible bid for Transatlantic and was the undisclosed party in question. Transatlantic had a merger agreement with its peer Allied World, which was struck in June, but both sides called off the deal in September amid overwhelming opposition. Validus, which has been interested in Transatlantic for years, launched a hostile bid in July but agreed to a limited standstill while in talks with the company.

193,BRKa,Bill Gates to urge G20 not turn backs on poor,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates said on Monday it was critical that rich donors continue to fund health and agriculture projects in developing countries despite budget cuts in the United States and Europe. In an interview with Reuters, Gates said he would tell G20 leaders at a summit in France next month not to turn their backs on funding development projects in poor countries despite tough times at home. He said there was ample evidence that agricultural and health programs in developing countries made a big difference in the livelihoods of the poor and boosted economic stability. “One thing with agriculture is once you get a boot strap it is a capitalistic market,” Gates said. “If you help a farmer with productivity and show them these new tools have positive returns, then it is something you can leave and you don’t have to keep funding them.” A global food price crisis in 2008 highlighted years of chronic underinvestment in agriculture in developing countries. Costlier food and more price volatility have further weighed on the poor, increasing malnutrition and hunger. Despite 2009 promises by the world’s rich nations to increase funding for agricultural in developing countries, Gates said just half of the promised funds had been received. A sovereign debt crisis gripping Europe and cut in overseas spending in the United States to address budget shortfalls have raised concerns of major scaling back of assistance to the world’s poorest countries. Gates and Howard Buffett, the farmer-conservationist son of investor Warren Buffett, were honored on Monday by the UN’s World Food Program for their efforts in helping farmer overcome hunger and poverty. Their Purchase for Progress program has helped small-scale farmers supply UN food programs in Africa and also sell crops to private companies. The Gates Foundation has also funded initiatives to develop drought-resistant maize and new flood-tolerant rice varieties in India. French President Nicolas Sarkozy asked Gates earlier this year to look into innovative financing that could be used to fund aid to poor countries. Gates will submit the final report to the G20 meeting in Cannes, France, on November 2-3. He said while rising economic powers such as China and Brazil were playing a greater role in helping poorer countries and sharing knowledge on agriculture, traditional aid remained critical in funding development programs. “It is absolutely critical that every meeting we talk to people about meeting their aid commitments, and I’m sure the dialogue at the G20 including my report will be no exception to that,” Gates said, adding: “The rich countries still have the bulk of the resources.” An early draft of Gates’ report obtained by Reuters in September proposed taxing financial transactions, tobacco, and shipping and aviation fuels to raise development aid. Countries such as Canada, Britain, the United States, Australia and China oppose the so-called “Tobin Tax” on financial transactions because it puts an additional financial burden on their banks. “Clearly it is up to the G20 countries,” Gates said. “...But I’m hopeful it will be more than worth the time I put into it but I’ll have to see,” he added. Gates indicated that Mexico would take up the issue when it takes over from France as next G20 chair. In remarks while accepting the World Food Program’s George McGovern Leadership Award, Gates said the famine and drought in the Horn of Africa should be a wake-up call for the international community. “It is unconscionable for a famine of this magnitude to be happening in 2011. The world has the knowledge, tools, and resources to help the world’s poorest overcome hunger and extreme poverty,” he told the ceremony.

194,BRKa,Buffett sheds tech aversion with big IBM investment,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett has always made his distaste for technology investments clear, but on Monday he changed his ways in spectacular fashion. The Berkshire Hathaway chief executive said he has bought nearly $11 billion of International Business Machines Corp stock in the last eight months, building a roughly 5.5 percent stake that potentially makes him the largest shareholder in the company. It was a surprise reversal for Buffett, who has always said he would not invest in technology because he largely did not understand it. But in an interview on cable television network CNBC, Buffett said he was struck by IBM’s ability to retain corporate clients, which made it indispensable in a way that few other services are. “It’s a company that helps IT departments do their job better. It is a big deal for a big company to change auditors, change law firms” or to switch to a new technology vendor, Buffett said. “I don’t know of any large company that really has been as specific on what they intend to do and how they intend to do it as IBM,” said Buffett, who teased CNBC’s anchors for a few minutes with a guessing game about what the major investment was before unveiling the IBM news. IBM shares, which have a market value of about $220 billion, were up 0.2 percent to $187.79 in afternoon trading. Earlier they hit $189.84, nearing the all-time high of $190.53 that the stock touched in mid-October. Buffett, known as one of the best value investors of all time, appeared to have come to IBM late in the game — a year ago the stock was a third lower than it is now. Buffett himself said he should have paid more attention to IBM five years ago. Yet technology analysts said he had still gotten a good deal. “Maybe he could have gotten a better price ... but if you look at Warren Buffett’s investment policy I would assume this is a long term investment,” said Collins Stewart analyst Louis Miscioscia. “This is not your father’s IBM; the management has done a good job of cost control, returning cash to shareholders.” Though it seems like a contrarian move, one long-time Berkshire investor speculated that Buffett was buying IBM for its services business rather than its technology platform. “It’s going to be one of the four or five ‘generals’ in the portfolio,” said Steve Check, chief investment officer of Check Capital Management, a California firm. Another long-standing Berkshire shareholder said the investment was also a global play. “More confirm(ation) that he sees international as more important,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of wealth manager YCMNET Advisers, which manages about $1 billion and holds Berkshire shares. The investment fits with Buffett’s desire to make big bets. Earlier this year, in his annual letter to investors, he joked about having a loaded elephant gun ready to make big deals. He has followed through on that, buying chemicals company Lubrizol, investing $5 billion in Bank of America Corp and taking the IBM position. Though Berkshire started buying IBM shares in March, Buffett’s comments suggested the firm did not cross reporting thresholds on the investment until the third quarter, which let him keep the stake secret until Monday. Buffett has also previously asked for, and received, the right to keep some investments temporarily confidential on the grounds that, given his notoriety, if his trades were to be known, masses of investors might try to pile in as well. The IBM stake was so confidential, in fact, that the company had no idea Buffett was investing in it until he disclosed that he had bought 64 million shares on TV on Monday. An IBM spokesman declined to comment. According to Thomson Reuters data, Buffett’s 5.5 percent position in IBM would tie him with State Street Corpinvestment management affiliate State Street Global Advisors for the largest stake in the company. During the third quarter, IBM shares traded in a range of $157.14 to $185.61, suggesting that no matter when Buffett bought, he is still up on his investment at least $160 million. The median analyst price target for the stock is $200, with 14 of 28 analysts rating it a “strong buy” or “buy” and the rest rating it a “hold,” according to Thomson Reuters data. One thing Buffett is not buying is European banks. Buffett comes up whenever there is talk of a large European bank needing to raise capital, particularly in the current environment of writedowns on sovereign debt. But he told CNBC that he would need to understand European banks better before investing, and that he has not yet seen an investment opportunity there in which he wants to take part. The “Oracle of Omaha” and Berkshire Hathaway chief executive said he expects Europe’s economy to show improvement 10 years from now, but getting there will be difficult. In a three-hour interview, Buffett also disclosed that he was interviewed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in June about David Sokol, his former heir apparent who left Berkshire amid scandal earlier this year.

195,BRKa,WRAPUP 1-Buffett sheds tech aversion with big IBM investment,"* Berkshire Hathaway becomes a top shareholder in IBM * Started building stake in March, now owns 5.5 pct * Buffett says not buying European banks due to crisis * Acknowledges SEC interview over Sokol episode By Ben Berkowitz Nov 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett has always made his distaste for technology investments clear, but on Monday he changed his ways in spectacular fashion. The Berkshire Hathaway chief executive said he has bought nearly $11 billion of International Business Machines Corp stock in the last eight months, building a roughly 5.5 percent stake that potentially makes him the largest shareholder in the company. It was a surprise reversal for Buffett, who has always said he would not invest in technology because he largely did not understand it. But in an interview on cable television network CNBC, Buffett said he was struck by IBM’s ability to retain corporate clients, which made it indispensable in a way that few other services are. “It’s a company that helps IT departments do their job better. It is a big deal for a big company to change auditors, change law firms” or to switch to a new technology vendor, Buffett said. “I don’t know of any large company that really has been as specific on what they intend to do and how they intend to do it as IBM,” said Buffett, who teased CNBC’s anchors for a few minutes with a guessing game about what the major investment was before unveiling the IBM news. IBM shares, which have a market value of about $220 billion, were up 0.2 percent to $187.79 in afternoon trading. Earlier they hit $189.84, nearing the all-time high of $190.53 that the stock touched in mid-October. Buffett, known as one of the best value investors of all time, appeared to have come to IBM late in the game — a year ago the stock was a third lower than it is now. Buffett himself said he should have paid more attention to IBM five years ago. Yet technology analysts said he had still gotten a good deal. “Maybe he could have gotten a better price ... but if you look at Warren Buffett’s investment policy I would assume this is a long term investment,” said Collins Stewart analyst Louis Miscioscia. “This is not your father’s IBM; the management has done a good job of cost control, returning cash to shareholders.” Though it seems like a contrarian move, one long-time Berkshire investor speculated that Buffett was buying IBM for its services business rather than its technology platform. “It’s going to be one of the four or five ‘generals’ in the portfolio,” said Steve Check, chief investment officer of Check Capital Management, a California firm. Another long-standing Berkshire shareholder said the investment was also a global play. “More confirm(ation) that he sees international as more important,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of wealth manager YCMNET Advisers, which manages about $1 billion and holds Berkshire shares. The investment fits with Buffett’s desire to make big bets. Earlier this year, in his annual letter to investors, he joked about having a loaded elephant gun ready to make big deals. He has followed through on that, buying chemicals company Lubrizol, investing $5 billion in Bank of America Corp  and taking the IBM position. Though Berkshire started buying IBM shares in March, Buffett’s comments suggested the firm did not cross reporting thresholds on the investment until the third quarter, which let him keep the stake secret until Monday. Buffett has also previously asked for, and received, the right to keep some investments temporarily confidential on the grounds that, given his notoriety, if his trades were to be known, masses of investors might try to pile in as well. The IBM stake was so confidential, in fact, that the company had no idea Buffett was investing in it until he disclosed that he had bought 64 million shares on TV on Monday. An IBM spokesman declined to comment. According to Thomson Reuters data, Buffett’s 5.5 percent position in IBM would tie him with State Street Corp investment management affiliate State Street Global Advisors for the largest stake in the company. During the third quarter, IBM shares traded in a range of $157.14 to $185.61, suggesting that no matter when Buffett bought, he is still up on his investment at least $160 million. The median analyst price target for the stock is $200, with 14 of 28 analysts rating it a “strong buy” or “buy” and the rest rating it a “hold,” according to Thomson Reuters data. One thing Buffett is not buying is European banks. Buffett comes up whenever there is talk of a large European bank needing to raise capital, particularly in the current environment of writedowns on sovereign debt. But he told CNBC that he would need to understand European banks better before investing, and that he has not yet seen an investment opportunity there in which he wants to take part. The “Oracle of Omaha” and Berkshire Hathaway chief executive said he expects Europe’s economy to show improvement 10 years from now, but getting there will be difficult. In a three-hour interview, Buffett also disclosed that he was interviewed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in June about David Sokol, his former heir apparent who left Berkshire amid scandal earlier this year. Sokol left the company after it emerged he had bought shares in Lubrizol while trying to convince Buffett to acquire it.

196,BRKa,Buffett not interested in European banks: report,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett, often mentioned as a potential savior for troubled European banks, said on Monday that he has no interest at the moment in investing in the sector, and that there is what amounts to a partial run on Europe. The legendary investor and Berkshire Hathaway Inc chief executive, in a CNBC interview, said he expects Europe’s economy to have improved 10 years from now, but getting there would be difficult. Buffett, who put $5 billion into Bank of America Corp earlier this year, comes up whenever there is talk of a large European bank needing to raise capital, particularly in the current environment of writedowns on sovereign debt. But he told CNBC that he would need to understand those banks better before investing in them, and that he has not yet seen an investment opportunity there in which he wants to take part. In a wide-ranging interview, Buffett said he expects that Republican Mitt Romney will be his party’s nominee for president in next year’s U.S. election. Buffett has recently been raising funds for President Barack Obama. He also reiterated his position that the economy will improve when the housing market turns around. That turn will come, he said, when the country starts creating more households than houses. Berkshire has a number of housing-related businesses, including operations in carpet and brick, that he has said are doing as poorly as ever in the current environment.

197,BRKa,UPDATE 5-Buffett builds $10.7 bln stake in IBM,"* Says started buying in March * Did not tell IBM he was accumulating stake * Due to report quarterly holdings Monday night By Ben Berkowitz Nov 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett said his Berkshire Hathaway Inc has accumulated a 5.5 percent stake in IBM , the billionaire investor’s biggest bet in the technology field he has historically shunned. Buffett said he was convinced by IBM’s long-term roadmap and by its entrenched position with major businesses — part of the durable competitive advantage that he looks for when investing in a company. “I don’t know of any large company that really has been as specific on what they intend to do and how they intend to do it as IBM,” Buffett told CNBC in an interview on Monday. The move puts Buffett’s money squarely in the heart of the technology industry, a sector he has steadfastly avoided on the grounds he simply did not understand it. One long-term Berkshire investor said the investment was a global play. “More confirm(ation) that he sees international as more important,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of wealth manager YCMNET Advisers, which manages about $1 billion and holds Berkshire shares. Buffett said he had bought about 64 million shares of IBM, paying $10.7 billion. Berkshire started buying the shares in March, with a goal of building a $10 billion position, he said. Buffett said IBM did not know that he was building a stake and that the company was finding out about his investment for the first time as he disclosed it on television. An IBM spokesman declined to comment. Buffett said he has always looked at IBM’s annual report — his preferred method of identifying companies to invest in — but this year “I read it through a different lens.” He said follow-on conversations with various technology executives throughout the Berkshire conglomerate convinced him to start building the stake. Berkshire is due to make a quarterly report of its equity holdings Monday night. Though it started buying IBM shares in March, Buffett’s comments suggested Berkshire did not cross reporting thresholds on the investment until the third quarter, which let him keep the stake secret until Monday. According to Thomson Reuters data, a 5.5 percent position in IBM would tie Buffett with State Street Global Advisors for the largest stake in the company. IBM shares rose nearly 1 percent in premarket trading. Buffett, known as one of history’s great value investors, appears to have gotten into IBM late in the game. By early March, when he started buying the stock, the shares had risen more than 25 percent from their low of six months earlier. Even the stock’s lowest point during the third quarter, when Buffett built the rest of his stake, was one of its highest levels ever. At a Friday close of $187.38, the stock is nearing analysts’ median price target of $200, according to Thomson Reuters data. One place where Buffett is not investing is European banks. Buffett, who put $5 billion into Bank of America Corp earlier this year, comes up whenever there is talk of a large European bank needing to raise capital, particularly in the current environment of writedowns on sovereign debt.

200,BRKa,UPDATE 3-HIGHLIGHTS-US hedge funds remain divided on banks,"* Beat-up BlackBerry manufacturer RIM finds some love * Viking Global dumps JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, BlackRock * Berkshire Hathaway now a top IBM shareholder * TPG-Axon Capital disconnects from Sprint Nov 14 (Reuters) - David Einhorn and David Tepper backed away from drug company Pfizer Inc . Warren Buffett loves technology giant IBM Corp . And Stephen Mandel’s Lone Pine Capital was among funds unloading video rental company Netflix Inc during the quarter. Or at least that is what quarterly regulatory filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed. For Wall Street, the third quarter was a tumultuous one with stocks swinging widely over fears about the potential for another U.S. recession and the still unresolved debt crisis in Europe. And for U.S. money managers it was a time to make big shifts in their portfolios, either to escape the carnage or position themselves for a fourth-quarter rebound. With the release of so-called 13-F filings, investors began to get insight into the reaction of money managers to macro-economic events. But as is always the case with 13-F filings, this is backward looking information that very well could have changed since the end of the third quarter on Sept. 30. Buffett, one of the world’s most closely watched investors, has tended to favor financial and industrial companies. But in the third quarter, his Berkshire Hathaway Inc made a bold move into International Business Machines, taking a 5.5 percent stake. Berkshire also bought 9.3 million shares of chipmaker Intel Corp . Philippe Laffont’s Coatue hedge fund is best-known for making tech bets and, in the third-quarter, took a position in RIM shares, which have fallen 70 percent this year. Coatue’s accumulation of 1.5 million shares of the BlackBerry maker comes as some hedge funds agitate for a management shake-up or sale of the company. While many hedge fund managers were exiting Yahoo Inc in the third quarter, Lee Ainslie’s Maverick Capital bought more than 5.81 million shares of the Internet search engine. Mandel’s Lone Pine Capital added modestly to several technology holdings during the third quarter, including Apple Inc , Google Inc Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp , NetApp Inc and Sensata Technologies Holding NV . Laffont’s fund cut its stake in wireless chip manufacturer Qualcomm Inc nearly in half to 3.9 million shares. But John Thaler’s JAT Capital Management, one of the most closely watched hedge funds in 2011, more than tripled his stake in Qualcomm to 1.9 million by the end of the third quarter. George Soros’ Soros Fund Management increased his bet on telecommunications equipment maker Motorola Solutions Inc , increasing his stake by almost 20 percent to 6.6 million shares. At the same time, Soros appeared to have dumped over 325,000 shares of spun-off smart phone unit Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc . Dinakar Singh’s TPG-Axon Capital, after building a 37 million-share stake in Sprint Nextel Corp in the second quarter, unloaded all of that stock in the third quarter, a filing shows. John Paulson, whose Paulson & Co is one of this year’s most surprising losers, cut back on Citigroup Inc , trimming his holding to 25 million shares from 33.5 million. He also raised his holdings of Bank of America Corp  to 64 million from 60 million. But Tepper’s Appaloosa also got rid of its final 10 million shares of Bank of America, one of the quarter’s worst performing stocks, after trimming the position during the second quarter. Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global no longer lists owning JPMorgan Chase & Co , Morgan Stanley and BlackRock Inc . But the manager massively increased US Bancorp to 24.5 million shares from 9.7 million and added a brand new holding of 6 million shares of Citigroup. Maverick, meanwhile, added more than 4.8 million of JPMorgan Chase & Co shares to its portfolio. Dan Loeb’s Third Point Management, which had raised his stake in CIT Group Inc in the second quarter, making it one of his bigger holdings, eliminated the stock in the most recent quarter. Bruce Berkowitz’s Fairholme Capital Management sold 69 percent of its holding in Morgan Stanley, but purchased more than 4 million shares in Jefferies Group Inc . Einhorn told his investors he liquidated his position in drugmaker Pfizer — which at 23.5 million shares was his biggest — at the end of the second quarter. Tepper’s Appaloosa appears to have mirrored Einhorn when he liquidated his largest position and sold 14.5 million shares of Pfizer as well. Meanwhile, Berkshire bought 5.7 million shares of pharmacy operator CVS Caremark Corp . Third-quarter filings also showed what hedge funds did with two one-time momentum plays, Netflix and coffee company Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc . Both stocks have fallen on hard times, with Green Mountain tumbling after Einhorn publicly said he was betting against, or shorting, the stock. Laffont’s Coatue dumped its Netflix shares, but remains a big holder of Green Mountain, according to the filings.    Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management owned Netflix in the second quarter but no longer listed it in the third quarter. And Mandel was among funds unloading Netflix during the quarter. After owning 639,421 shares at the end of June, Mandel listed no stake for the end of the third quarter. Mindich’s Eton Park also doubled his ownership of Viacom, which owns Comedy Central.",11152011,http://www.reuters.com/article/hedgefunds-holdings/update-3-highlights-us-hedge-funds-remain-divided-on-banks-idUSN1E7AD1XG20111115

I do know the system as presently designed has a major flaw and that flaw won’t be corrected just by words,” he told CNBC during his first trip to Japan on Monday. Buffett, dubbed the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ for his long track record as a value investor, said he had no idea how Europe’s sovereign debt crisis, which started in Greece two years ago and rages on, would end, though he noted there were good valuations among companies in Europe. “Not in the debt space, but in the equity space there are opportunities. I can think of a dozen euro stocks that are attractive ... there are stocks I like and wonderful businesses. “We bought Tesco earlier. I could buy more if the price came down,” said the 81-year-old chief of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, referring to the British retailer. Buffett earlier told reporters in Iwaki City in northeast Japan that he also sees opportunities to invest in the country and was not deterred by either the March earthquake or a scandal engulfing camera and medical device maker Olympus. Making a trip that he had cancelled in March due to the earthquake and tsunami, Buffett told reporters: “My view on Japanese people and Japanese industries is unchanged. We just had a demonstration over months that the tsunami did not stop Japanese business and the people.” “Olympus doesn’t change my view at all on Japanese investments,” Buffett said, referring to a widening accounting scandal at the company, which has admitted hiding losses for decades through improper accounting, raising questions about Japanese corporate governance standards. Buffett earlier opened a new plant at cutting tool maker Tungaloy Corp, a unit of an Israeli firm in which Berkshire Hathaway holds an 80 percent stake. The factory is just 40 km from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant that was crippled by the disaster in March. Posing for photographs outside the new factory with staff, holding a sign saying, “Never give up, Fukushima”, Buffett said he felt “very welcomed”. Tungaloy, once part of conglomerate Toshiba Corp, supplies automakers with superhard tools used to cut, groove and turn engine parts. A swift recovery in Japanese manufacturers’ supply chains and output helped the world’s No. 3 economy rebound from a post-quake recession and grow by 1.5 percent in the third quarter. But a strong yen, cooling demand in key export markets and disruptions from widespread flooding in Thailand — a major production base for Japanese firms — have clouded the outlook, and Japanese stocks are down about 18 percent this year — their worst performance since 2008. Japan’s exports fell 3.7 percent in the year to October, the fastest pace in five months, signalling more weakness ahead as the strong yen and sputtering global growth drag on the recuperating economy. Known for avoiding companies he does not understand — including those in the technology sector — Buffett surprised markets this month when he revealed Berkshire spent nearly $11 billion to build up a 5.5 percent stake in IBM. Buffett has said he was convinced by IBM’s long-term road map and by its entrenched position with major businesses — part of the durable competitive advantage he looks for when investing. Early this month, Berkshire Hathaway reported a smaller third-quarter profit after losing more than $2 billion on derivatives related to stock market performance.

202,BRKa,UPDATE 2-Alleghany near $3.4 bln Transatlantic deal-source,"* Alleghany set to pay $59-$60 per share in cash and stock * Deal may be announced on Monday * Former Berkshire exec Brandon part of Alleghany bid By Paritosh Bansal NEW YORK, Nov 21 (Reuters) - U.S. property and casualty insurer Alleghany Corp is nearing a deal to buy Transatlantic Holdings Inc for about $3.4 billion, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, in the latest twist in a drawn-out battle for the reinsurer. Alleghany is expected to pay $59 per share to $60 per share in cash and stock for Transatlantic, the source said, adding a deal could be announced as soon as Monday. Shares of Transatlantic closed at $54.43 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. Alleghany’s expected offer price would mean a premium of about 8-10 percent over Transatlantic’s Friday close. A deal with Alleghany could help Transatlantic ward off rival Validus Holdings Ltd, which has gone hostile in its attempt to buy the company. Validus last offered to buy Transatlantic for around $55.35 per share and was also seeking to remove seven incumbent Transatlantic directors and have three of its nominees elected to the target company’s board. Transatlantic rejected Validus’s offer as inadequate earlier this month and said it was continuing to pursue discussions about a potential sale to two other parties. Those parties included former Berkshire Hathaway  insurance executive Joseph Brandon, who at one point was working with Morgan Stanley on a possible bid for Transatlantic, and Enstar Group, which has private equity firm J.C. Flowers as one of its largest shareholders. Brandon is now working with Alleghany on the bid and is expected to join the company’s management team, the source said. SOUGHT-AFTER ASSET Davis Selected Advisors, a key player in the success of any bid for Transatlantic as its largest shareholder, is supportive of the deal, the source said. Alleghany, Transatlantic Holdings and Davis Selected Advisors could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters outside regular U.S. business hours. Transatlantic has become a sought-after asset as it is seen as relatively cheap and has ‘long-tail’ insurance lines, such as medical malpractice and worker compensation, that are attractive to reinsurers more exposed to ‘short-tail’ risks such as hurricane damage. Transatlantic first struck a deal in June this year to merge with rival Allied World Assurance Co Holdings Ltd, but had to call off that agreement in September after it became the subject of competing offers, including those from Validus and a unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. In September, the company also announced a $600 million share buyback program, aiming to repurchase $300 million worth of its shares by the end of this year. Transatlantic was controlled by insurer AIG until 2009, when AIG reduced its stake in an effort to raise capital following a U.S. government bailout.",11212011,http://www.reuters.com/article/transatlantic-alleghany/update-2-alleghany-near-3-4-bln-transatlantic-deal-source-idUSN1E7AJ0DE20111121

Buffett, dubbed the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ for his long track record as a value investor, will hold a press briefing at 4.15 p.m. (0715 GMT) after touring a factory near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant crippled by the earthquake and tsunami in March. That disaster came just days before Buffett had been due to make his maiden visit to Japan. At the time, the head of Berkshire Hathaway Inc said the earthquake was one of those extraordinary events that created buying opportunities. In May, he said he would be “delighted” to invest in Japan.

204,BRKa,"Warren Buffett picks up a newspaper, sees potential","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett buys newspapers every day, including his hometown daily, but on Wednesday he dispensed with the single-issue price and bought the whole company instead. Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway said it would buy the Omaha World-Herald Co, owner of the paper of the same name, six other dailies and a series of weekly papers in Nebraska and Iowa. The World-Herald, which calls itself the last major employee-owned paper in the country, splashed the news across its website, with a picture of the paper’s publisher introducing Buffett to the staff. It is 80 percent owned by employees and 20 percent by the Peter Kiewit Foundation. The paper reported that Buffett would pay $150 million cash, or about $1,109 per subscriber, and assume $50 million in debt. “I wouldn’t do this if I thought this was doomed to some sort of extinction,” the paper said Buffett told a gathering of employees. “It is a reasonable investment. There is no question it is affected by the fact that I am extremely bullish on Omaha, Nebraska.” The World-Herald’s publisher, Terry Kroeger, told the paper the holding company would have needed a capital infusion at some point in the future, as older shareholders were selling stock back faster than younger reporters were buying it. The news appears to have stunned the reporters, for whom Buffett was one of the biggest subjects of their business coverage. The paper’s designated Buffett reporter even did a weekly online chat about Buffett called “Warren Watch.” “I don’t think anyone’s going to be covering anything today. Everyone seems to be too busy talking about the Buffett news,” World-Herald reporter Roseann Moring said on her Twitter feed in response to a request for coverage of another item. With average daily circulation of just over 135,000, it is one of the larger papers in the country. The World-Herald Co said in a statement that Buffett’s ownership would make it easier for the paper to raise money while preserving local control. One newsroom employee, who spoke under condition of anonymity, said Wednesday’s announcement was positive. “It’s obviously good news for the paper because we were facing a pretty heavy load of debt to pay to older stockholders (as they retired). “This is good news for the employees. I think it is good long-term news for the paper, which is in good shape, but was facing some pretty heavy bills down the road.” The holding company had already made some cuts in 2008 and 2009 to improve its finances, including nearly 100 layoffs. It also sold some smaller Iowa papers last year. Berkshire is no stranger to the newspaper business. The company bought the Buffalo News in New York in 1977 and has operated it since, though Buffett said in 2009 his owning the paper was not entirely rational. Buffett was also a long-time board member of the Washington Post Co and a confidante of legendary publisher Katharine Graham. Buffett has said that U.S. newspapers face years of “nearly unending losses” because they lack a sustainable business model. Advertising revenue and circulation at many U.S. papers have fallen in the past several years as people turned to the Internet for free news and advertising, forcing some newspapers out of business and some publishers into filing for bankruptcy protection or laying off thousands of employees. But the 81-year-old “Oracle of Omaha” struck a more moderate tone on Wednesday as he addressed the paper’s staff. “I think newspapers ... have a decent future. It won’t be like the past. But there are still a lot of things newspapers can do better than any other media. They not only can be sustained, but are important,” he was quoted as saying. The deal also adds to Buffett’s stable of local businesses. Though his focus is usually national or global, he owns a number of large Omaha brands, including the sprawling Nebraska Furniture Mart and the jeweler Borsheim’s.

205,BRKa,Buffett's utility company to buy First Solar plant,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s MidAmerican Energy Holdings said on Wednesday it would make its first move into solar energy with the purchase of First Solar’s Topaz Solar Farm power plant in California, one of the two largest under construction in the world. MidAmerican Energy, the utility arm of Berkshire Hathaway, already operates wind power facilities, and its move into solar comes amid growing worries about the solar industry’s ability to finance large utility-scale projects. Financial details of the transaction were not available. Shares of First Solar rose as much as 12.5 percent on the Nasdaq on Wednesday. The deal for the plant, which at 550 megawatts would equal the capacity of another First Solar California project called Desert Sunlight, comes after the company failed to win a U.S. loan guarantee to help finance its construction. “The fact that Topaz was financed without a DOE loan guarantee is a major milestone in the industry’s maturity and evolution,” Frank DeRosa, First Solar’s senior vice president of project and business development for the Americas, said in an interview. The Topaz plant, being built in San Luis Obispo County, will have the capacity to generate enough energy to power about 160,000 average California homes, MidAmerican Energy said in a statement. The deal “demonstrates that solar energy is a commercially viable technology without the support of governmental loan guarantees,” Greg Abel, chairman, president and CEO of MidAmerican, said in a statement. Earlier in the day, Reuters had reported about the deal quoting a source familiar with the transaction. Analysts speculated that the plant’s sale price was likely inside the range that First Solar had sold previous projects on a per-watt basis, putting it between $1.65 billion to $1.95 billion. “If nothing else, what this does is it tells you that First Solar will be able to sell what it makes, and that certainly is better than any other solar company can say at this point,” said Jeff Bencik, analyst at Kaufman Bros. The acquisition dovetails with Berkshire’s increasing interest in solar technologies in recent years, the most notable example being its investment in China’s BYD Co Ltd. Though BYD is best known for its electric cars, it is also one of the world’s largest battery makers and has a nascent solar panel business as well. Even though financial details were not disclosed, First Solar’s struggles financing the plant suggest that Berkshire likely got a good deal, which fits in with Buffett’s value investing strategy. He famously said earlier this year he had a loaded elephant gun with which he was searching for big deals, and he has made a number of them, including the $9 billion takeover of chemical maker Lubrizol and an $11 billion investment in IBM Corp. Ever since Buffett took a stake of nearly 10 percent in BYD during the depths of the financial crisis in late 2008 — via MidAmerican rather than Berkshire proper — Buffett-watchers have speculated the company had an interest in using BYD’s battery technology at renewable energy plants. Buffett’s long-time business partner Charlie Munger has also been a cheerleader for the potential of solar. “All kinds of things are going to be possible once we really gear up to harness the sun,” Munger once said in a CNNMoney interview. “That has always required cheaper solar and better batteries and they’re both coming.” The Topaz plant may qualify for a cash grant totaling 30 percent of its construction costs under a program that expires at the end of 2011. That cash grant program will turn into a tax incentive at the beginning of next year. Pacific Gas and Electric Co will buy the electricity from Topaz under a 25-year agreement, Des Moines, Iowa-based MidAmerican Energy said. First Solar had hoped to secure a loan guarantee from the U.S. government to help finance construction of the plant as it had for three other large solar projects this year. Political pressure on the Department of Energy following the collapse of start-up solar manufacturer Solyndra prompted fresh scrutiny of the loan guarantee application process, and First Solar’s Topaz project was not able to meet the September program deadline. Solyndra, which had received more than $500 million of government funding, collapsed into bankruptcy at the beginning of September. First Solar’s three DOE loan guarantee projects were sold to NextEra Energy Inc, NRG Energy Inc and Exelon Corp, respectively. MidAmerican’s addition to that list shows that investors are becoming more comfortable with solar, DeRosa said. “As each deal gets done and the number of investors increases, people see that these projects are working well, they get constructed on time, they are on budget and they operate well,” he said. First Solar is the largest U.S. photovoltaic solar company and the world’s lowest-cost solar manufacturer. But along with others in the sector, it has been hard hit by a glut of solar panels on the market that has driven prices down by 40 percent so far this year, narrowing its cost advantage over its rivals in China and Europe. Shares of First Solar, which had fallen nearly 65 percent through Monday’s close, were up 4.6 percent at $48.25 on Wednesday afternoon, off an earlier high of $51.89.

208,BRKa,Buffett's MidAmerican makes second foray in solar,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s MidAmerican Energy Holdings made its second foray into solar energy in as many weeks, saying on Friday it will buy a 49 percent stake in an Arizona power plant from NRG Energy Inc. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. MidAmerican, the utility affiliate of Buffett’s holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc, said it will take a stake in the 290-megawatt Agua Caliente project in Yuma County, Arizona. The plant is being built by solar power company First Solar Inc and is supported by a $967 million loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy. The $1.8 billion project is expected to be completed in 2014. California utility Pacific Gas & Electric will buy the project’s electricity output. The announcement comes a little over a week after MidAmerican said it would buy First Solar’s 550 MW Topaz Solar Farm power plant in California. “We are aggressively pursuing opportunities to expand our presence in the renewable energy sector, and the Agua Caliente project is another important step toward that goal,” MidAmerican Chief Executive Greg Abel said in a statement. NRG had said in May that it planned to bring partners into the project. The company first said a year ago that it would invest up to $800 million in the Agua Caliente power plant. The partnership “enhances the strength and credibility of what was already one of the world’s leading solar projects,” NRG CEO David Crane said. The acquisition dovetails with Berkshire’s increasing interest in solar and other alternative energy technologies in recent years, the most notable example being its investment in China’s BYD Co Ltd. Though BYD is best known for its electric cars, it is also one of the world’s largest battery makers and has a nascent solar panel business as well. Solar power is still more expensive than electricity generated from fossil fuels, but the Agua Caliente project may qualify for a cash grant totaling 30 percent of its construction costs under a federal program to stimulate development of renewable energy. “Solar projects on a market basis are far from economic, but when you consider the fact that utilities have to buy solar power right now, MidAmerican, NRG and other solar project owners can make a good return,” said Morningstar analyst Travis Miller. “First Solar and SunPower are developers and if they have new projects we would expect that MidAmerican and NRG would at least consider investing in their projects.” ",12162011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nrg-midamerican/buffetts-midamerican-makes-second-foray-in-solar-idUSTRE7BF1LS20111216

210,BRKa,"Buffett to Republicans: if you pay, so will I","WASHINGTON/BOSTON (Reuters) - Warren Buffett is willing to put his money where his mouth is, if only congressional Republicans would join him. The American billionaire investor, in the new issue of Time magazine, says he would donate $1 to paying down the national debt for every dollar donated by a Republican in Congress. The only exception is Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell - for whom Buffett said he would go $3-to-$1. The idea stems from a New York Times opinion piece Buffett wrote last August in which he said the rich ought to pay more taxes. It sparked an instant controversy, with some Washington conservatives calling on the 81-year-old “Oracle of Omaha” to voluntarily pay extra. McConnell said at the time that if Buffett felt “guilty” about paying too low a tax rate, he should “send in a check.” This was quickly followed by introduction of a bill to give taxpayers an option on tax forms to make voluntary donations. “It restores my faith in human nature to think that there are people who have been around Washington all this time and are not yet so cynical as to think that can’t be solved by voluntary contributions,” the Buffett told Time for an article hitting newsstands on Friday. An aide to McConnell suggested that the Berkshire Hathaway CEO should expand his matching offer to President Barack Obama and his Democrats. “Senator McConnell says that Washington should be smaller, rather than taxes getting bigger. And since some, like President Obama and Mr. Buffett want to pay higher taxes, Congress made it possible for them to call their own bluff and send in a check,” said Don Stewart, McConnell’s deputy chief of staff. “So I look forward to Mr. Buffett matching a healthy batch of checks from those who actually want to pay higher taxes, including Congressional Democrats, the President and the Democratic National Committee,” he added. The jabs over voluntary payments come as higher taxes for the wealthy and extension of payroll tax breaks for middle-class Americans are becoming increasingly contentious issues for the 2012 presidential race. Obama is trying to paint Republicans as only favoring the wealthy, while Republicans are trying to brand the president as relying on tax hikes to fund excessive spending. Buffett said in the Time interview the United States needed a tax system that favored people who were not born investors. “We need a tax system that takes very good care of people who just really aren’t as well adapted to the market system, and to capitalism, but are nevertheless just as good citizens, and are doing things that are of use in society,” he said. Buffett, who has raised money for President Barack Obama recently, also takes swings at Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich in the Time interview, criticizing Gingrich’s track record and Romney’s ties to the private equity business.

211,BRKa,"U.S. weighs 30 percent ""Buffett Rule"" tax on millionaires","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Millionaires would pay a minimum 30 percent effective tax rate under a law introduced on Wednesday in the Senate with the backing of President Barack Obama and named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Nicknamed the “Buffett Rule,” the tax bill reflects Democrat Obama’s bid ahead of November elections to highlight the sort of unfairness he says is represented by Buffett’s tax anomaly - that he pays a lower effective rate than his secretary does. The “Paying a Fair Share Act of 2012,” introduced by Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, has almost no chance of passage this year as the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has sworn off tax increases. “The president is desperate to distract attention away from his failed economic policies,” Kevin Smith, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, said on Wednesday. House Republicans “are going to focus on tax policy that actually helps create jobs - not soundbites,” he said. Revenue generated from the tax has yet to be officially calculated, but Whitehouse said it could raise $40 billion to $50 billion a year. In October, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, introduced the American Jobs Act, which included a first version of the Buffett rule as a 5.6 percent surtax on millionaires. It never came to a vote. About 94,500 taxpayers, a quarter of all U.S. millionaires, pay a lower tax rate than the bulk of middle-income taxpayers, according to the Congressional Research Service. Buffett makes a living off investments, which are taxed at 15 percent for capital gains and qualified dividends. Buffett’s secretary earns a salary and is taxed in wage-income tax brackets that range from 10 percent to 35 percent. The tax fairness issue flared last month when Republican Mitt Romney, one of the wealthiest men ever to run for president, and his wife Ann came under pressure to release their tax returns. Documents released last week showed they paid an effective tax rate of 13.9 percent in 2010 and expect to pay a 15.4 percent effective tax rate when they file their returns for 2011. Obama seized on the issue in his State of the Union address last week when he called for the 30 percent minimum tax. Buffett’s secretary, Debbie Bosanek, attended the speech as a guest of first lady Michelle Obama. Republicans in the House and Senate have countered with legislation that would allow taxpayers to donate money to the Treasury Department if they feel they are not paying enough in taxes.

214,BRKa,Buffett's Berkshire muscles into Thai reinsurance,"HONG KONG/BANGKOK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) is pushing into the Thai reinsurance market and selling cover for higher rates, taking advantage of the retreat of competitors such as France’s CCR after they suffered losses from last year’s floods. The presence of the U.S. conglomerate in the Thai market was confirmed by several sources in the insurance industry, including one who said Berkshire began doing business in the country in late December. “Obviously a number of reinsurers have been affected... some decided to pull out entirely. Only the new guy (Berkshire Hathaway) who had not much money involved, can come in and offer cover,” said one reinsurance executive in the region. Berkshire’s strategy in Thailand, which had a non-life reinsurance market of roughly $1 billion in premiums in 2010, is being led by top reinsurance executive and potential Buffett successor Ajit Jain, and is opportunistic, the sources said. Berkshire will offer to write 100 percent of the business or none at all, a third executive said. The sources quoted in this story declined to be named for fear of damaging their relationship with Berkshire. Berkshire did not respond to a request for comment for this story. It is due to release its annual letter to shareholders on Saturday. The letter typically references Jain and describes some of Berkshire’s insurance and reinsurance activities. Berkshire’s arrival in Thailand was previously reported by The Insurance Insider trade publication, which wrote that Berkshire is underwriting losses over a set amount, and is monopolizing loss-sharing arrangements. Berkshire’s loss-sharing arrangements only allow syndication of up to 30 percent of losses to other reinsurers, according to the trade publication. “They have the capacity to do it on their own, and, quite frankly from their perspective, why would you want to share it?” the third executive said. “Folks like Ajit Jain are very smart. They go in when the rates are extremely high and they leave when the rates come down.” Jain has an appetite for off-beat policies. He once wrote a policy protecting the Texas Rangers if baseball player Alex Rodriguez were ever permanently disabled; he wrote another policy guaranteeing a $1 billion prize being offered by an Internet company, according to Berkshire’s annual letters. In his 2010 annual letter to shareholders, Buffett wrote that Jain “insures risks that no one else has the desire or the capital to take on...yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources.” Buffett praised Jain for adding billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire and compared Jain to Superman: “Even kryptonite bounces off Ajit,” he wrote. “There’s a lot of deference to Ajit Jain,” the third executive said. “He’s quite a rock star in the reinsurance world. People don’t want to be crosswise him and he’s very secretive about what he’s doing — and rightfully so. He doesn’t want people to be following him and taking his business.” Berkshire has struck other non-insurance related deals during moments of crisis and those have paid off handsomely. In August, Berkshire agreed to invest $5 billion in Bank of America Corp (BAC.N). During the financial crisis it also helped prop up Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and General Electric (GE.N). The Goldman deal famously paid Berkshire $15 a second in dividends until Goldman bought out Berkshire last year. Thailand this week said its economy grew just 0.1 percent in 2011, dragged down by the country’s worst flooding in half a century that damaged farmland and inundated big industrial zones in October, hitting thousands of factories, particularly car and electronics makers. Many of the affected firms are still shut and may take a while to reopen. Insured losses from the floods are seen topping $15 billion but it will be months before individual insurers and reinsurers know how they have fared. “We don’t know our losses yet. It will be another six months before we have meaningful figures,” the reinsurance executive said. “It’s all guesswork right now.” Japanese insurers, which had insured factories operating in Thailand, were among the hardest hit. Japan’s top three property-and-casualty insurers, MS&AD; (8725.T), Tokio Marine (8766.T) and NKSJ (8630.T), posted a combined loss of about 370 billion yen ($4.7 billion) in the nine months ended in December, dragged by a total 331.5 billion yen in Thai flood-related costs. France’s CCR stopped writing new business in Thailand following the flooding. Lloyd’s Syndicate 1965, which operated solely in Asia, also stopped accepting new business, and Lloyd’s Hardy Underwriting undertook a “strategic review” of its operations following losses from catastrophes across Asia. The rumor mill is churning out a longer list of other insurers and reinsurers that could follow suit. “I don’t think most underwriters fully understood the full risk over there and maybe they’re being caught a little bit by surprise,” . Rates have more than doubled for property and industrial insurance and earthquake, storm and flood coverage is being sold separately, if at all, the reinsurance executive said. According to a report this month from insurance credit ratings agency A.M. Best, flood policies are now being sold separately and premiums are expected to double or triple. Rates for excess-of-loss protection are seen rising 500 percent to 1,000 percent, policies are expected to cap certain types of losses at 10 percent to 20 percent of the sum insured, and deductibles of 10 percent are also expected. Besides Berkshire, other foreign capital is also finding its way into Thailand. Canada-based financial services firm Fairfax in January said it would buy a 25 percent stake in Thai Reinsurance Pcl (THRE.BK) for $70 million.

Berkshire’s arrival in Thailand was previously reported by The Insurance Insider trade publication, which wrote that Berkshire is underwriting losses over a set amount, and is monopolising loss-sharing arrangements. Berkshire’s loss-sharing arrangements only allow syndication of up to 30 percent of losses to other reinsurers, according to the trade publication. “They have the capacity to do it on their own, and, quite frankly from their perspective, why would you want to share it?” the third executive said. “Folks like Ajit Jain are very smart. They go in when the rates are extremely high and they leave when the rates come down.” Jain has an appetite for off-beat policies. He once wrote a policy protecting the Texas Rangers if baseball player Alex Rodriguez were ever permanently disabled; he wrote another policy guaranteeing a $1 billion prize being offered by an Internet company, according to Berkshire’s annual letters. In his 2010 annual letter to shareholders, Buffett wrote that Jain “insures risks that no one else has the desire or the capital to take on...yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources.” Buffett praised Jain for adding billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire and compared Jain to Superman: “Even kryptonite bounces off Ajit,” he wrote. “There’s a lot of deference to Ajit Jain,” the third executive said. “He’s quite a rock star in the reinsurance world. People don’t want to be crosswise him and he’s very secretive about what he’s doing — and rightfully so. He doesn’t want people to be following him and taking his business.” Berkshire has struck other non-insurance related deals during moments of crisis and those have paid off handsomely. In August, Berkshire agreed to invest $5 billion in Bank of America Corp. During the financial crisis it also helped prop up Goldman Sachs and General Electric. The Goldman deal famously paid Berkshire $15 a second in dividends until Goldman bought out Berkshire last year. Thailand this week said its economy grew just 0.1 percent in 2011, dragged down by the country’s worst flooding in half a century that damaged farmland and inundated big industrial zones in October, hitting thousands of factories, particularly car and electronics makers. Many of the affected firms are still shut and may take a while to reopen. Insured losses from the floods are seen topping $15 billion but it will be months before individual insurers and reinsurers know how they have fared. “We don’t know our losses yet. It will be another six months before we have meaningful figures,” the reinsurance executive said. “It’s all guesswork right now.” Japanese insurers, which had insured factories operating in Thailand, were among the hardest hit. Japan’s top three property-and-casualty insurers, MS&AD;, Tokio Marine  and NKSJ, posted a combined loss of about 370 billion yen ($4.7 billion) in the nine months ended in December, dragged by a total 331.5 billion yen in Thai flood-related costs. France’s CCR stopped writing new business in Thailand following the flooding. Lloyd’s Syndicate 1965, which operated solely in Asia, also stopped accepting new business, and Lloyd’s Hardy Underwriting undertook a “strategic review” of its operations following losses from catastrophes across Asia. The rumour mill is churning out a longer list of other insurers and reinsurers that could follow suit. “I don’t think most underwriters fully understood the full risk over there and maybe they’re being caught a little bit by surprise,” . Rates have more than doubled for property and industrial insurance and earthquake, storm and flood coverage is being sold separately, if at all, the reinsurance executive said. According to a report this month from insurance credit ratings agency A.M. Best, flood policies are now being sold separately and premiums are expected to double or triple. Rates for excess-of-loss protection are seen rising 500 percent to 1,000 percent, policies are expected to cap certain types of losses at 10 percent to 20 percent of the sum insured, and deductibles of 10 percent are also expected. Besides Berkshire, other foreign capital is also finding its way into Thailand. Canada-based financial services firm Fairfax in January said it would buy a 25 percent stake in Thai Reinsurance Pcl for $70 million.",2232012,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-thailand/buffetts-berkshire-muscles-into-thai-reinsurance-idUSL2E8D60WN20120223
216,BRKa,Buffett adds to bullish U.S. economic recovery signals,"(Reuters) - Anyone looking for more evidence of a strengthening U.S. economic recovery need only consider conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), where businesses ranging from railroads and electric utilities to furniture and candy stores are racking up record profits. Even though Berkshire’s Warren Buffett says with emphasis that the housing market is still in a depression, he was as upbeat as ever this weekend on the rest of the dozens of businesses he owns. “Though housing-related businesses remain in the emergency room, most other businesses have left the hospital with their health fully restored,” Buffett said on Saturday in his closely watched annual letter to shareholders. Berkshire’s five largest non-insurance businesses, all of them industrial in some way, posted record profits last year and should do the same this year, he said, surpassing $10 billion in combined earnings. That being the case, Berkshire broke its own records for capital spending in 2011 by a wide margin and expects to do so again in 2012 - almost all of it domestically, even with the company’s global footprint. “About 95 percent of these outlays were made in the U.S., a fact that may surprise those who believe our country lacks investment opportunities. We welcome projects abroad, but expect the overwhelming majority of Berkshire’s future capital commitments to be in America.” There are other big investments on tap, too. Buffett said his home-furnishings retailer, Nebraska Furniture Mart, bought a 433-acre (175-hectare) parcel north of Dallas and will construct what it expects to be the highest volume store of its kind anywhere. He also forecast billions of dollars in spending on solar and wind energy projects. Investors who have been with Buffett over the long term expected his optimism. “That’s not surprising,” said Michael Yoshikami, CEO of Destination Wealth Management, in California, noting in particular Buffett’s sense that the banking business is back in shape. “He’s obviously a believer in the financial sector being a key to the overall economy.” Buffett sounded a similar tone in 2011. “I don’t see how anybody can be other than enthused about this country,” Buffett told Berkshire shareholders last year at the company’s annual meeting, even as the country was in the middle of a crisis over its debt ceiling and credit ratings. Nonetheless, at this delicate stage in the U.S. economic recovery, his words carry weight, partly because of his successes over the years and partly from the sheer size and scope of Berkshire, which employees more than 270,000 people in nearly 80 businesses. That gives him a view into many of the same factors policymakers consider when they try to figure out what to do next with the sluggish economy. Federal Reserve officials have noted lately that while the economic recovery is tepid, there is sufficient evidence that things are picking up to warrant holding off on further stimulus measures. Buffett’s optimism is not confined to industry. He said that “the banking industry is back on its feet” and singled out two of his favorite investments, Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N). He also took a fair bit of space in the letter to call into question the value of bonds and commodities as investments, and to praise his own favorite category, “productive assets” like businesses and real estate. “Ideally, these assets should have the ability in inflationary times to deliver output that will retain its purchasing-power value while requiring a minimum of new capital investment. Farms, real estate, and many businesses such as Coca-Cola (KO.N), IBM (IBM.N) and our own See’s Candy meet that double-barreled test,” he said. If there is one sore spot, it is the housing market. A year ago, Buffett said he expected the housing sector to recover within a year or so. He acknowledged that call turned out “dead wrong.” Berkshire’s five housing-related businesses were profitable the past two years, but at a level two-thirds less than they were in 2006. They have shed 26 percent of their staff over that time, more than 15,000 people in total. As he has in the past, Buffett said the problem was an excess of supply and no one to soak it up. On Saturday, he proposed that lust, of all things, would solve the problem eventually. “Every day we are creating more households than housing units. People may postpone hitching up during uncertain times, but eventually hormones take over. And while ‘doubling-up’ may be the initial reaction of some during a recession, living with in-laws can quickly lose its allure.” ",2252012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-economy/buffett-adds-to-bullish-u-s-economic-recovery-signals-idUSTRE81O0PH20120225
217,BRKa,"Berkshire identifies Buffett successor, not by name","(Reuters) - Warren Buffett told investors on Saturday the Berkshire Hathaway board has identified his successor, easing some shareholder concern about the future of the company once the famed 81-year-old investor steps down as chief executive. Buffett did not disclose who the next CEO will be in his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders. But he began the dispatch with the succession topic, one that’s been a huge issue for shareholders for years. He then delved into familiar Buffett themes - namely his continued appetite for deals, his preference for stocks over treasuries and gold, and his bullish view on the U.S. economy. The Omaha, Nebraska, company has said little about who would step in for the “Oracle of Omaha” and the letter contained the most information to date: Buffett made clear there is a chosen replacement for him now rather than a list from which the board could pick. “Your Board is equally enthusiastic about my successor as CEO, an individual to whom they have had a great deal of exposure and whose managerial and human qualities they admire,” he said, adding there were two backup candidates as well. One Berkshire investor said the nugget of extra clarity was a huge relief, adding he was particularly pleased the issue was addressed at the outset of the letter. “I think the succession issue is a very big box to be checked off for Berkshire shareholders and maybe even future holders,” said David Rolfe, chief investment officer of Wedgewood Partners and manager of the RiverPark/Wedgewood Fund. While Buffett is in his 80s, he is known to be in good health and has made clear he does not plan to step down from running the company any time soon. But another shareholder said he thinks the level of detail in Saturday’s letter signals a change could be coming. “One could chalk up the explicit details of succession plans as being prudent, but in my opinion I don’t think they would have been this explicit about succession unless there was some two- or three-year plan to step down,” said Michael Yoshikami, CEO and founder of Destination Wealth Management. Famous for a poor diet that relies heavily on beef, Buffett joked in the letter that he could consume another 12 million calories before death. Buffett also retold the tale of one-time business partner Rose Blumkin, who sold Buffett a stake in the Nebraska Furniture Mart when she was 89 but continued working until she was 103. “After retiring, she died the next year, a sequence I point out to any other Berkshire manager who even thinks of retiring,” Buffett wrote. Buffett, who has been at the helm of Berkshire for 47 years, controls a conglomerate that employs more than 270,000 people worldwide in dozens of businesses ranging from railroads and electric utilities to ice cream and underwear. Though the successor’s name is not known, the most common guess among Berkshire watchers is Ajit Jain, who runs Berkshire’s reinsurance business. As usual, Buffett and his partner, Charlie Munger, lavished praise for him in the letter. “Charlie would gladly trade me for a second Ajit. Alas, there is none,” Buffett said. In addition to Jain, four other names crop up in speculation on a successor: Burlington Northern chief Matthew Rose, Geico auto insurance boss Tony Nicely, utility company MidAmerican’s Greg Abel and reinsurer General Re’s chief Tad Montross. All four are known to have Buffett’s admiration, though none are as heavily favored as Jain. Yoshikami said he still thinks Jain is the choice; Wedgewood’s Rolfe, however, said Jain’s more limited experience may be a drawback. He said the best candidate would be “the guy who knows the culture and would least affect the underlying business and I think that’d be Nicely.” One name that was conspicuously absent from the letter, though, was David Sokol. Once one of Buffett’s star lieutenants and long presumed to be his successor, Sokol left Berkshire last year amid questions of improper stock trading. The episode prompted inquiries from securities regulators and was a major black mark on Buffett’s track record, but there was no mention at all in his summation of the year. One investor who has held Berkshire shares for more than 25 years said one can never assume the “choice” of a new CEO is actually final. “I don’t think that there’s ever a final checkoff of succession issues. Warren’s approach over the years has been to retain the option to select the best person,” said Thomas A. Russo, a partner at Gardner Russo & Gardner, one of Berkshire’s 10-largest institutional Class A shareholders. The other part of Berkshire’s succession plan - who will run its huge investment portfolio when Buffett is gone - is much clearer. The company has hired two investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, each running or soon to run nearly $2 billion in assets. Buffett said in the letter that Combs and Weschler would be capable of running Berkshire’s investment portfolio after Buffett is gone. There had been speculation Berkshire might add a third manager down the line. “Each will be handling a few billion dollars in 2012, but they have the brains, judgment and character to manage our entire portfolio when Charlie and I are no longer running Berkshire,” Buffett said. Combs and Weschler have made a few notable bets already, among them a large stake in satellite broadcaster DirecTV and a more recent position in content company Liberty Media. Buffett later added that the two would likely help the new CEO make acquisitions down the line. Merger activity was Buffett’s major theme in last year’s letter, in which he famously said he had a loaded elephant gun to hunt for big deals and an itchy trigger finger. He satisfied that itch a number of times, most notably spending $9 billion to buy chemical company Lubrizol, $5 billion to backstop Bank of America with preferred shares and $11 billion to become the largest shareholder of IBM. Buffett noted Saturday he is not done buying, saying Berkshire would like to make large deals to add to operating earnings. “My task is clear, and I’m on the prowl,” he said. Berkshire ended 2011 with $37.3 billion in cash on hand, even though profits fell in the most recent quarter. Buffett also said Berkshire would keep making investments in things like solar and wind energy at MidAmerican, as well as in equities and other assets with some sort of output. He took the chance in the letter, as he often has in the past, to cast doubt on bonds, commodities and currencies as investment opportunities. “My own preference - and you knew this was coming - is our third category: investment in productive assets, whether businesses, farms, or real estate,” Buffett said.

223,BRKa,Buffett: My successor is in the dark too,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett resisted pressure on Monday to identify his successor as chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway, saying the person who has been chosen does not even know it himself. In his annual investor letter on Saturday, Buffett said Berkshire’s board had identified someone who will replace him as CEO when the 81-year-old investor eventually leaves the post. But he did not identify that person in the letter, and in a CNBC interview on Monday, he rejected suggestions that he should. The public does not know who will be the next CEO of other major corporations, he said, and there is a disadvantage to having a “crown prince” in place. “Well, we have four stocks that we have $45 billion invested in: American Express, Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo and IBM. Every one of those four companies ... has changed management since we bought our shares. I didn’t have the faintest idea who the successor of management would be in any of those four, but we’ve put billions and billions of billions of dollars in there,” Buffett said in an interview from the printing plant of the Omaha World-Herald, the hometown newspaper he bought late last year. Buffett would say very little about the successor, other than that he is someone the board has had in mind for years and that the person does not know. He also said the heir apparent was likely to come from the ranks of dozens of chief executive officers at Berkshire operating companies. One person not on the list, though, is David Sokol. Once one of Buffett’s top lieutenants, and often assumed to be his heir apparent, Sokol left Berkshire last year amid a scandal over his stock trading while at the company. The Sokol matter largely dropped from public attention in recent months, but Buffett said Monday that he assumed there is an ongoing investigation, as Berkshire has already paid more than $1.4 million in legal bills for Sokol. Buffett added that securities regulators had not contacted him about the matter since last summer. Buffett’s comments on Saturday about succession helped to ease some shareholder concern about the future of the company. Buffett, who has been at the helm of Berkshire for 47 years, controls a conglomerate that employs more than 270,000 people worldwide in dozens of businesses ranging from railroads and electric utilities to ice cream and underwear. In a wide-ranging interview, he also disclosed that he made one of his largest bets ever on Europe at the end of last year. Buffett told CNBC he had put 175 million euros into each of eight European stocks at the end of last year, all companies that he said were undervalued and had clearly been affected by the sovereign debt crisis. He did not identify the investments, though. His existing European investments run the gamut from retail to financial services. A profoundly “buy American” investor, Buffett had just three European stocks among his 14 largest positions at the end of the year. Two of the three were in the red. The only thing Buffett said he liked better than stocks was houses. “It’s a very attractive asset class right now,” he said, adding he would be happy to buy thousands of houses and take out low-rate 30-year mortgages on them if there was an efficient way to manage such a portfolio.

224,BRKa,"UPDATE 3-Buffett: My successor is in the dark, too","* Said Saturday the board has had one successor in mind * Board has had that name in mind for years * Sokol probe ongoing - Buffett Feb 27 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett resisted pressure on Monday to identify his successor as chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway, saying the person who has been chosen does not even know it himself. In his annual investor letter on Saturday, Buffett said Berkshire’s board had identified someone who will replace him as CEO when the 81-year-old investor eventually leaves the post. But he did not identify that person in the letter, and in a CNBC interview on Monday, he rejected suggestions that he should. The public does not know who will be the next CEO of other major corporations, he said, and there is a disadvantage to having a “crown prince” in place. “Well, we have four stocks that we have $45 billion invested in: American Express, Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo and IBM. Every one of those four companies ... has changed management since we bought our shares. I didn’t have the faintest idea who the successor of management would be in any of those four, but we’ve put billions and billions of billions of dollars in there,” Buffett said in an interview from the printing plant of the Omaha World-Herald, the hometown newspaper he bought late last year. Buffett would say very little about the successor, other than that he is someone the board has had in mind for years and that the person does not know. He also said the heir apparent was likely to come from the ranks of dozens of chief executive officers at Berkshire operating companies. One person not on the list, though, is David Sokol. Once one of Buffett’s top lieutenants, and often assumed to be his heir apparent, Sokol left Berkshire last year amid a scandal over his stock trading while at the company. The Sokol matter largely dropped from public attention in recent months, but Buffett said Monday that he assumed there is an ongoing investigation, as Berkshire has already paid more than $1.4 million in legal bills for Sokol. Buffett added that securities regulators had not contacted him about the matter since last summer. Buffett’s comments on Saturday about succession helped to ease some shareholder concern about the future of the company.    Buffett, who has been at the helm of Berkshire for 47 years, controls a conglomerate that employs more than 270,000 people worldwide in dozens of businesses ranging from railroads and electric utilities to ice cream and underwear. In a wide-ranging interview, he also disclosed that he made one of his largest bets ever on Europe at the end of last year. Buffett told CNBC he had put 175 million euros into each of eight European stocks at the end of last year, all companies that he said were undervalued and had clearly been affected by the sovereign debt crisis. He did not identify the investments, though. His existing European investments run the gamut from retail to financial services. A profoundly “buy American” investor, Buffett had just three European stocks among his 14 largest positions at the end of the year. Two of the three were in the red. The only thing Buffett said he liked better than stocks was houses. “It’s a very attractive asset class right now,” he said, adding he would be happy to buy thousands of houses and take out low-rate 30-year mortgages on them if there was an efficient way to manage such a portfolio. Over the weekend Buffett made a point of emphasizing that housing was in a depression and that the U.S. economy would only really improve when the housing market did.",2272012,http://www.reuters.com/article/buffett/update-3-buffett-my-successor-is-in-the-dark-too-idUSL2E8DR2BX20120227

235,BRKa,US sues Buffett's NetJets unit for unpaid taxes,"* IRS says Berkshire’s NetJets owes $366.3 mln * Berkshire sued for $642.7 mln over errant “ticket tax” * NetJets declines to discuss litigation By Jonathan Stempel March 9 (Reuters) - NetJets Inc, a private jet-sharing company owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc  , was sued for $366.3 million by the U.S. government to recover unpaid taxes, four months after sued the government for nearly twice as much. Four NetJets units have “failed, neglected or refused” to pay excise taxes and related penalties between 2003 and 2009, according to the countersuit filed Thursday with the U.S. District Court in Columbus, Ohio, where NetJets is based. NetJets Aviation Inc owes $302.1 million, NetJets International Inc owes $53 million, Executive Jet management Inc owes $10 million and NetJets Large Aircraft Inc owes $1.19 million, according to the countersuit. Colleen Nissl, NetJets’ general counsel, said the company does not comment on pending litigation. On Nov. 14, NetJets had sued to recoup $642.7 million in taxes and penalties, accusing the Internal Revenue Service of having mistakenly imposed a “ticket tax” meant to apply only to passengers who buy seats on commercial or charter aircrafts. NetJets said that as a manager of private aircraft, it was not required to pay the tax because its services were not “taxable transportation.” It also said the IRS put it at a disadvantage to rivals that did not have to pay the tax. Last year, NetJets posted a $227 million pretax profit, continuing a turnaround after prior management had racked up $1.9 billion of debt and regularly posted quarterly losses. “A few years ago NetJets was my number one worry: Its costs were far out of line with revenues, and cash was hemorrhaging,” Buffett, the world’s third-richest person according to Forbes magazine, wrote last month in his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders. “These problems are behind us.” Berkshire is based in Omaha, Nebraska.

236,BRKa,Lawsuit against Berkshire over Sokol affair dismissed,"WILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway won dismissal on Monday of a shareholder lawsuit that stemmed from allegations former executive David Sokol profited by violating the company’s insider trading policy. Shareholders sued the conglomerate’s board for refusing to take legal action against Sokol, a former heir apparent at Berkshire. Sokol resigned last year after disclosing he bought 96,000 shares of Lubrizol Corp and then urged Berkshire Chief Executive Warren Buffett to acquire the chemical company. The episode has raised questions about Buffett’s oversight of the conglomerate, which he has led since 1965. Buffett said last year that Sokol violated the company’s insider trading rules to score a $3 million windfall profit on Lubrizol shares, which rose by nearly a third after Berkshire announced it would buy the company. Although Delaware Chancery Court judge Travis Laster dismissed the case, he described the claims against Sokol as “really strong” and said it might raise questions if the board did not pursue Sokol. “If they are not doing something with a claim like that, you have to wonder why,” he said. Laster also said the initial news release from the company disclosing Sokol’s trade in Lubrizol suggested “a willingness to let him slide.” However, Laster said the shareholders failed to make their argument the board was so beholden to their prestigious positions that they could not be trusted to pursue Sokol, a once-close associate of Buffett. The shareholders wanted the right to pursue that litigation on behalf of the company in what is known as a derivative lawsuit. Laster accepted Berkshire Hathaway arguments that the company could reasonably want to wait for the outcome of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and may still sue Sokol. The company’s attorney said he did not know the status of the SEC investigation. Shareholders Mason Kirby and Alejandro Gonzalez were also seeking to force Buffett and other directors to compensate the company for damage to its reputation. Laster called that claim “profoundly weak.” The lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice, meaning shareholders could still file an amended lawsuit.

243,BRKa,Buffett delivers news and a tune at Omaha press club show,"COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (Reuters) - Investor Warren Buffett learned more than economics and thrift as a paper boy during the 1940s when he earned the $5,000 that launched the investments that grew into Berkshire Hathaway Inc. He also learned how to fold and tightly tuck newspapers into themselves so they wouldn’t fly apart when pitched to porches. Buffett, 81, demonstrated he still had the knack Saturday during a guest appearance at the annual Omaha Press Club Show, which pairs tunes with lyrics that spoof regional events and skewers and roasts newsmakers. Dressed as a World War II-era street-corner newsboy with a bag of newspapers at his left hip, Buffett folded and tossed copies of the Omaha World-Herald into the crowd of 500 while singing “I’m Only a Paperboy” to the tune of the 1933 song, “It’s Only a Paper Moon:” “I’m only a paperboy Just as happy as I can be ‘Cause the money you pay for this It all goes to me.” Buffett, chairman of Omaha-based Berkshire Hathaway, bought the employee-owned Omaha World-Herald for $200 million in December. The title of the show on Saturday was “Warren’s Herald.” Buffett’s secretary, Debbie Bosanek, made a cameo appearance as his “underpaid, overtaxed” executive assistant. Bosanek was thrust into the national spotlight in January when President Barack Obama invited her to the State of the Union address to illustrate concerns that middle-class workers’ wages are taxed at a higher rate than are the dividends and capital gains of the wealthy. Bosanek recited a list of the top five things she planned to spend money on when she lands in Buffett’s lower tax bracket. Counting down, she said, “A new ribbon for my Smith Corona typewriter,” “a set of earplugs for when Mr. Buffett practices his ukulele,” “an extra scuttle of coal for those cold January days at the office,” “a nice dinner anyplace but Gorat’s or Piccolo Pete’s (Buffett’s two favorite Omaha restaurants),” and “a brand new iMac, so I can stop using those crappy PCs he gets from Bill Gates.” Gates, co-founder and chairman of Microsoft, is a Berkshire Hathaway board member. He and Buffett are bridge-playing pals. The show, which raises money for journalism scholarships, was held at the Mid-America Center across the Missouri River from Omaha, Nebraska. Buffett’s next appearance on a stage will be in front of 20,000 shareholders from around the world during Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting May 5 in Omaha.

244,BRKa,"Warren Buffett has prostate cancer, sees no danger","(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc Chief Executive Warren Buffett said he has stage 1 prostate cancer but his condition “is not remotely life-threatening or even debilitating in any meaningful way.” Buffett, the world’s third-richest man, will begin a two-month treatment consisting of daily radiation treatments starting in mid-July, he said in a statement on Tuesday. This will limit his ability to travel during that time, Buffett added. The news from the 81-year-old “Oracle of Omaha” is likely to intensify the already brewing debate about the succession plan at Berkshire Hathaway, a conglomerate that employs more than 270,000 people in more than 70 businesses around the world. Doctors say he has a very good prognosis, given the disease’s early stage, though some questioned whether he even needed treatment at all given his age. Buffett told investors in late February that Berkshire had identified his successor, but in typically circumspect fashion, declined to say who it was - and ultimately admitted that even the chosen one does not know, himself. The news comes one day after Republicans in the U.S. Senate blocked the “Buffett rule,” a tax on millionaires whose idea was born of a now-famous editorial Buffett wrote in the New York Times last year, saying the rich had an obligation to pay more income tax. That debate ensnared Buffett’s secretary as well. After Buffett said she paid more taxes than he did, President Barack Obama invited Debbie Bosanek to attend this year’s State of the Union address. Berkshire shares fell 1.5 percent in after-hours trading following Buffett’s announcement. The widely held Class B shares are up 5.9 percent year-to-date, half the gains of the broader S&P; 500. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Meyer Shields, in a note to clients, said he expected some weakness in the stock on Wednesday but added the news did not necessarily make the succession worries behind his “hold” rating any more imminent. One Berkshire investor said it was reasonable to assume people would panic at the news of Buffett’s illness, but that nothing had actually changed in the case for the stock. “Despite the news, this is not a reason to sell (Berkshire). Fundamentals are still good at the company and the clear succession plan does give clarity about the future path of the firm,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of Destination Wealth Management in California. Another Berkshire investor who has written books about Buffett’s investment strategies said the news could have been much worse and was, ultimately, not a surprise. “He’s mortal, we knew that,” said Jeff Matthews, author of the book “Secrets in Plain Sight.” “I think it means zero for Berkshire investors. He’s been getting the company ready for the day he dies.” There were skeptics, though, who said the news could at least put a cap on the stock, which has underperformed in recent years. “The uncertainty will diminish the upside to this company,” said Doug Kass of Seabreeze Partners in Palm Beach, Florida, which owns B shares. The situation may not be that uncertain, though - medical professionals said Buffett faces good odds, even at his age. Any man diagnosed with stage 1 prostate cancer “has an excellent long-term prognosis,” said Jonathan Wright, a urological oncologist at the University of Washington and the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. “The cancer is in a very curable stage.” Buffett’s radiation therapy is standard care. Since the beam is extremely focused, there should be minimal side effects, though mild fatigue and a temporary worsening of urinary and bowel function are not uncommon, according to Mark Litwin, a researcher at UCLA’s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center and chairman of the Department of Urology. “Those dissipate quickly,” said Litwin. “A patient is usually able to work while receiving radiation treatment.” One in six American men will get prostate cancer, but only one in 36 will die of it, according to the American Cancer Society. Some doctors even questioned why Buffett was receiving treatment, given his age and since ‘active surveillance’ is often an option. “A good number of men with low risk cancer of the prostate can be observed without needing to be treated,” said Louis Potters, chairman of radiation medicine at North Shore-LIJ in New York. Buffett would also not be the first person to keep running a major company while being treated for cancer. AIG CEO Bob Benmosche was diagnosed with an undisclosed cancer 18 months ago and continues to run the bailed-out insurer. Buffett’s condition will now be center stage at Berkshire’s annual meeting on May 5. The festival-like event draws more than 40,000 shareholders to the company’s headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska.

245,BRKa,"UPDATE 5-Warren Buffett has prostate cancer, sees no danger","* Says condition “not remotely life-threatening” * Will begin 2 months of treatment in July * Annual meeting approaching soon * News likely to intensify succession issue * Berkshire Hathaway shares fall on news By Ben Berkowitz April 17 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc Chief Executive Warren Buffett said he has stage 1 prostate cancer but his condition “is not remotely life-threatening or even debilitating in any meaningful way.” Buffett, the world’s third-richest man, will begin a two-month treatment consisting of daily radiation treatments starting in mid-July, he said in a statement on Tuesday. This will limit his ability to travel during that time, Buffett added. The news from the 81-year-old “Oracle of Omaha” is likely to intensify the already brewing debate about the succession plan at Berkshire Hathaway, a conglomerate that employs more than 270,000 people in more than 70 businesses around the world. Doctors say he has a very good prognosis, given the disease’s early stage, though some questioned whether he even needed treatment at all given his age. Buffett told investors in late February that Berkshire had identified his successor, but in typically circumspect fashion, declined to say who it was - and ultimately admitted that even the chosen one does not know, himself. The news comes one day after Republicans in the U.S. Senate blocked the “Buffett rule,” a tax on millionaires whose idea was born of a now-famous editorial Buffett wrote in the New York Times last year, saying the rich had an obligation to pay more income tax. That debate ensnared Buffett’s secretary as well. After Buffett said she paid more taxes than he did, President Barack Obama invited Debbie Bosanek to attend this year’s State of the Union address. Berkshire shares fell 1.5 percent in after-hours trading following Buffett’s announcement. The widely held Class B shares are up 5.9 percent year-to-date, half the gains of the broader S&P; 500. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Meyer Shields, in a note to clients, said he expected some weakness in the stock on Wednesday but added the news did not necessarily make the succession worries behind his “hold” rating any more imminent. One Berkshire investor said it was reasonable to assume people would panic at the news of Buffett’s illness, but that nothing had actually changed in the case for the stock. “Despite the news, this is not a reason to sell (Berkshire). Fundamentals are still good at the company and the clear succession plan does give clarity about the future path of the firm,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of Destination Wealth Management in California. Another Berkshire investor who has written books about Buffett’s investment strategies said the news could have been much worse and was, ultimately, not a surprise. “He’s mortal, we knew that,” said Jeff Matthews, author of the book “Secrets in Plain Sight.” “I think it means zero for Berkshire investors. He’s been getting the company ready for the day he dies.” There were skeptics, though, who said the news could at least put a cap on the stock, which has underperformed in recent years. “The uncertainty will diminish the upside to this company,” said Doug Kass of Seabreeze Partners in Palm Beach, Florida, which owns B shares. The situation may not be that uncertain, though - medical professionals said Buffett faces good odds, even at his age. Any man diagnosed with stage 1 prostate cancer “has an excellent long-term prognosis,” said Jonathan Wright, a urological oncologist at the University of Washington and the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. “The cancer is in a very curable stage.” Buffett’s radiation therapy is standard care. Since the beam is extremely focused, there should be minimal side effects, though mild fatigue and a temporary worsening of urinary and bowel function are not uncommon, according to Mark Litwin, a researcher at UCLA’s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center and chairman of the Department of Urology. “Those dissipate quickly,” said Litwin. “A patient is usually able to work while receiving radiation treatment.” One in six American men will get prostate cancer, but only one in 36 will die of it, according to the American Cancer Society. Some doctors even questioned why Buffett was receiving treatment, given his age and since ‘active surveillance’ is often an option. “A good number of men with low risk cancer of the prostate can be observed without needing to be treated,” said Louis Potters, chairman of radiation medicine at North Shore-LIJ in New York. Buffett would also not be the first person to keep running a major company while being treated for cancer. AIG CEO Bob Benmosche was diagnosed with an undisclosed cancer 18 months ago and continues to run the bailed-out insurer. Buffett’s condition will now be center stage at Berkshire’s annual meeting on May 5. The festival-like event draws more than 40,000 shareholders to the company’s headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska.

It could be a dry run for when the real event eventually happens. “I expect Buffett to be similar to how he always has been at the annual meeting in a few weeks. Frankly, I think the succession issue gets talked about too much with Berkshire. Berkshire is a huge operating company with many businesses where Buffett has little involvement.

250,BRKa,Berkshire shares dip on Buffett cancer news,"(Reuters) - Shares in Berkshire Hathaway Inc fell less than 1 percent in early trading on Wednesday, a relatively limited reaction to the news that Chief Executive Warren Buffett has stage 1 prostate cancer and will start radiation treatment this summer. Buffett said Tuesday that he had the early-stage illness and that his condition “is not remotely life-threatening or even debilitating in any meaningful way. A number of long-term Berkshire shareholders shrugged off the news, given Buffett’s good prognosis and the succession planning Berkshire had already started. “We’ve owned the stock nearly continuously for 13 years. We’ve thought about succession a lot,” said David Rolfe, chief investment officer of Wedgewood Partners, which holds Berkshire Class B shares. “Somebody needs to say to themselves before they dump their Berkshire, in the mid-$70s ... there’s a chance they could be selling their shares back to Buffett,” Rolfe added, referring to a buyback Berkshire launched late last year. Class A shares fell $1,110 to $120,200, while the more widely held Class B shares fell 67 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $80.09. After underperforming the S&P; 500 in 2011, the stock has lagged again this year, with the Class B shares making just half the gains of the broader market through Tuesday.

253,BRKa,Buffett's cancer to be No. 1 topic at Berkshire meeting,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett is not one to talk much about his personal life in public, but his prostate cancer may dominate the conversation this weekend when his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) convenes its annual shareholder meeting. The event dubbed “Woodstock for Capitalism” draws more than 40,000 shareholders to Omaha, Nebraska’s convention center for a weekend of festivities, the highlight of which being the questions Buffett takes from investors. This year, for the first time, he will also entertain questions from a select group of analysts who follow Berkshire’s stock. Last year’s meeting was dominated by the scandal-driven resignation of one-time Buffett heir apparent David Sokol. Few expected fireworks this year — at least until Buffett’s April 17 disclosure that he has stage 1 prostate cancer and will begin radiation treatment in July. Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management and a Berkshire investor, said he and investors like him are hoping for more substance from this year’s session. “I’d like it to go back to answering meaningful questions,” said Smead, who holds both Class B shares and instruments representing fractional Class A shares. The health issue is part of the larger succession question that has hung over Berkshire in recent years and has weighed on the company’s share price. Buffett, 81, assuaged some of those concerns in February when he said the company had identified the person who would eventually succeed him as chief executive. Of course, Buffett may have made the problem worse when he said a few days later that his designated successor had not been made aware of the fact. The shortlist includes Berkshire’s reinsurance boss Ajit Jain, railroad executive Matthew Rose and GEICO CEO Tony Nicely. All have their backers, though none are likely to get a public nod until the day when Buffett can no longer work. Aside from the health question, the other major change this year is that Buffett will take questions from the Wall Street analysts he has historically held in such low regard. A hand-picked panel of three insurance analysts, all of whom have “buy” ratings on the stock, will likely question Buffett about the stock’s recent performance and future potential. One, Barclays Capital’s Jay Gelb, raised his price target on Berkshire’s Class B shares last Friday as part of a 115-page review of the company’s operations. Gelb and another of the questioners, KBW’s Cliff Gallant, have both had the equivalent of a “buy” rating on the stock since last August. “The question that’s never been asked as far as I know, nobody’s ever asked Warren Buffett ‘why do you think the stock price has lagged so much?’” said Steve Check, president and chief investment officer of Check Capital Management in California. “We get that from our clients,” said Check, whose firm’s largest holding by a wide margin is Berkshire B shares. Through April 24, Berkshire’s more widely held Class B shares were up 4.1 percent for the year, less than half the gains of the S&P; 500 or of the S&P; insurance index .GSPINSC. The stock also underperformed the S&P; 500 in two of the last three years. Many people maintain the stock is undervalued, perhaps even at one of its lowest valuations ever, but some say a discount could be warranted given the succession question. Shareholders will also be hoping for a look at the two men who will shepherd Berkshire’s investment portfolio after Buffett is gone, newly hired managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Combs has been building his portfolio, taking Berkshire into more tech and retail investments, while Weschler recently started and will soon show his hand.

254,BRKa,Berkshire profits double as insurance losses fall,"OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway more than doubled its profit in the first quarter, as the conglomerate’s insurance business was spared from the devastating natural disaster losses that hit the company a year earlier. The company also benefited from much higher gains in its derivatives portfolio, offset in part by a substantial write-down on one of its bond holdings. The results come one day before the conglomerate’s annual shareholder meeting, a festival-like event dubbed the “Woodstock for Capitalism” that draws nearly 40,000 investors to Omaha. Even before the results came out, though, one Berkshire investor said his fellow shareholders were much more likely to focus on succession issues for the 81-year-old Buffett than other questions like the quarterly report. “If you boil it down, most people say: ‘who’s the replacement going to be,’” said Harvey Eisen, chairman of Bedford Oak Advisors. Net income attributable to Berkshire shareholders more than doubled to $3.25 billion, or $1,966 per share, from $1.51 billion, or $917 per share, last year. First-quarter operating profit rose to $2.67 billion, or $1,615 per Class A share. Analysts expected operating profit of $1,780 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 13 percent to $38.15 billion, and Berkshire ended the quarter with $37.83 billion of cash and equivalents, up around $500 million from the beginning of the year. Berkshire posted a $54 million insurance underwriting profit in the quarter. That compared with a year-earlier $821 million loss, when results were hurt by costs for earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand and floods and a cyclone in Australia. Within the insurance group, underwriting gains at auto insurer GEICO fell sharply, in large part on accounting changes related to how insurers recognize the cost of acquiring customers.

255,BRKa,UPDATE 3-Berkshire profits double as insurance losses fall,"* Insurance underwriting reverses year-earlier loss * $337 million loss taken on bonds from former TXU * Net profit more than doubles By Ben Berkowitz OMAHA, Neb., May 4 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway more than doubled its profit in the first quarter, as the conglomerate’s insurance business was spared from the devastating natural disaster losses that hit the company a year earlier. The company also benefited from much higher gains in its derivatives portfolio, offset in part by a substantial writedown on one of its bond holdings. The results come one day before the conglomerate’s annual shareholder meeting, a festival-like event dubbed the “Woodstock for Capitalism” that draws nearly 40,000 investors to Omaha. Even before the results came out, though, one Berkshire investor said his fellow shareholders were much more likely to focus on succession issues for the 81-year-old Buffett than other questions like the quarterly report. “If you boil it down, most people say: ‘who’s the replacement going to be,’” said Harvey Eisen, chairman of Bedford Oak Advisors. Net income attributable to Berkshire shareholders more than doubled to $3.25 billion, or $1,966 per share, from $1.51 billion, or $917 per share, last year. First-quarter operating profit rose to $2.67 billion, or $1,615 per Class A share. Analysts expected operating profit of $1,780 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 13 percent to $38.15 billion, and Berkshire ended the quarter with $37.83 billion of cash and equivalents, up around $500 million from the beginning of the year. Berkshire posted a $54 million insurance underwriting profit in the quarter. That compared with a year-earlier $821 million loss, when results were hurt by costs for earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand and floods and a cyclone in Australia. Within the insurance group, underwriting gains at auto insurer GEICO fell sharply, in large part on accounting changes related to how insurers recognize the cost of acquiring customers. Losses narrowed in the reinsurance business as well. Berkshire said profit from railroad operations, including the former Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp, rose 15 percent to $701 million. Meanwhile, profit from manufacturing, service and retailing operations rose 53 percent to $854 million.

257,BRKa,Buffett's lieutenants see economy picking up,"OMAHA (Reuters) - All signs point to slow but steady economic growth as consumers gradually increase their spending, senior executives of Warren Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway said on Friday. Nearly 40,000 Berkshire (BRKa.N) shareholders are gathering in Omaha this weekend for the company’s annual meeting. While a good bit of Saturday’s Q-and-A is expected to focus on Buffett’s health and succession planning, the “Oracle of Omaha” will inevitably field a number of questions on the economy. Two of his most consumer-oriented businesses, the confectioner See’s Candy and the furniture rental business Cort, have seen something of a turn for the better. “It’s basically more of what we’ve seen the last couple of years, slow growth,” See’s Chief Executive Brad Kinstler said in an interview. “The consumer continues to spend just a little more than a year ago.” See’s, which expects to grow store count by about 5 percent this year with an expansion in the Midwestern United States, is also expecting sales to grow around 5 percent this year, as mall traffic increases slightly. Jeff Pederson, the president of Cort, said his company was also seeing things loosen up. “Businesses are starting to use some of their capital,” Pederson said, adding Cort was also having success in the niche of furniture rental to college students. “That part of our business has been very vibrant the last two years.” Their comments seem to echo the sentiment of their boss, who has been cautiously bullish of late. “We’re still seeing an economy that’s improving, but it’s not at a fast rate,” Buffett told CNBC in comments aired Friday morning. Buffett has said the biggest problem in the market is housing inventory — new families need places to live, and as empty homes getting soaked up by that expansion, housing-related businesses (like Berkshire’s own Acme Brick and Shaw Carpet) can start to rebound. While he has admitted being wrong on the timing of that recovery, long-time Berkshire investors are still backing his strategy. “We think that now is a wonderful time to be an optimist about the United States of America,” said Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management. “We’re happy to be philosophically aligned with what he’s doing.” ",5042012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-ceos/buffetts-lieutenants-see-economy-picking-up-idUSBRE8431GF20120504

259,BRKa,"Buffett plays down health concern, mulled megadeal","OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - Warren Buffett tried to allay fears of Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders about the company’s future after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, and revealed that he recently tried to make one of the biggest acquisitions of his storied career. The question of who will succeed Buffett, 81, as chief executive became more of an imperative after Buffett disclosed the diagnosis on April 17. While Buffett called it “a really minor event,” his early-stage prostate cancer was a reminder that for all his success as an investor and all the plaudits he gets, Buffett is mortal and would be hard to replace at the company he has run since 1965. That made the future of Berkshire, with or without Buffett, a central focus of the five hours of questions at its annual meeting on Saturday in downtown Omaha, Nebraska. “I don’t think that every deal that I made would necessarily be makeable by a successor, but they’ll bring other talents,” including skills to be an effective chief risk officer, Buffett said. “We’re not going to have an arts major in charge of Berkshire.” Charlie Munger, who is Berkshire’s 88-year-old vice chairman and sat beside Buffett, quipped: “I rather resent all this sympathy and attention that Warren is getting. I probably have more prostate cancer than he does.” The annual meeting is the centerpiece of a weekend of events that Buffett has dubbed “Woodstock for Capitalism.” Close to 40,000 shareholders were expected to attend this year. Buffett on Saturday also said that he recently considered a more than $20 billion acquisition, and would have sold some Berkshire stock holdings he wanted to keep to get it done. “I wish we could have made it,” he said. “It could happen. I don’t think it will happen.” Buffett did not name the target. A takeover of that magnitude would have been close in size to Berkshire’s biggest takeover — the $26.5 billion purchase of railroad company Burlington Northern Santa Fe in 2010. It would have also dented Berkshire’s $37.83 billion cash hoard. Buffett said he wants to keep $20 billion on hand. Berkshire has about 80 operating units, which sell such things as car insurance, chemicals, clothing, furniture and ice cream. WAL-MART, POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS This year’s meeting had fewer fireworks than the 2011 meeting, which was dominated by the then-recent, scandal-driven resignation of Buffett heir apparent David Sokol. Yet Buffett offered a blunt assessment on a scandal enveloping Wal-Mart Stores Inc, in which Berkshire held a $2.33 billion common stock stake at year end. Last month, the New York Times said the retailer’s majority-owned Wal-Mart de Mexico unit ran a widespread bribery campaign in that country to win market dominance, and that senior Wal-Mart executives tried to cover it up. “If you read the New York Times story, and there’s always another side to it, it looks like they may well have made a mistake in how that was handled,” Buffett said. He nonetheless said he did not believe the matter “changes the fundamental dynamic” about Wal-Mart or its earnings power. Among the internal candidates seen as possible future Berkshire chief executives are Ajit Jain, Buffett’s top insurance lieutenant; Matthew Rose, who leads Burlington Northern; and Greg Abel, who runs the MidAmerican Energy unit. Tony Nicely, who runs the Geico auto insurance unit, has long been seen as a candidate, but is now in his late 60s. “I virtually know that the successor we have in mind ... has the culture and the people embedded as I do,” Buffett said. Buffett has also hired two portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, to handle some of Berkshire’s investments. He said each was recently given another $1 billion to invest, boosting their portfolios to $2.75 billion each. The meeting took place one day after Berkshire said first-quarter profit more than doubled, as its insurance business was spared the huge losses that natural disasters in Australia, Japan and New Zealand caused a year earlier. Buffett even said that Berkshire is writing “a lot more” reinsurance in those countries, as well as in Thailand. He was also upbeat about Berkshire’s prospects, despite slow U.S. economic growth and the inability of the United States and other countries to get their fiscal houses in order. “I would stay away from medium- or long-term government bonds, our own or those of other countries,” he said. Buffett also said that despite his huge investment in International Business Machines Corp, which topped $11.7 billion at year end, he would not plunge into other technology giants such as Apple Inc and Google Inc. “The chances of being way wrong in IBM are probably less, at least for us,” than in Google or Apple, Buffett said. Though Berkshire shares have lagged broader stock and insurance stock indexes in recent months, shareholder enthusiasm at the meeting does not appear to have flagged. “(The) stock is a home run over the next five years,” said Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management in Seattle. Berkshire did not repurchase shares in the first quarter, and Buffett said he would be comfortable repurchasing stock at a price of 1.1 times book value, and perhaps higher. Buffett also said Berkshire may buy more newspapers. It owns the Buffalo News, just bought the hometown Omaha World-Herald, and is a longtime shareholder of Washington Post Co. As in recent years, Buffett and Munger fielded questions from shareholders and three journalists. For the first time, they also took questions from three insurance industry analysts — Barclays Capital’s Jay Gelb, KBW’s Cliff Gallant, and Dowling & Partners’ Gary Ransom — who each have the equivalent of a “buy” rating on Berkshire. While some hoped the analysts would add depth to the meeting, some of their questions concerned relatively arcane matters such as mortality rates in insurance, or whether Geico would use electronics to track driver behavior. Gelb did ask the question that prompted Buffett’s comment about a mega-takeover. Prior to the questioning, shareholders were regaled with the annual comedy-infused movie made by Buffett’s daughter Susie. In one sketch, Buffett sang and played the ukulele with the cast of the TV show “Glee.” Another featured Buffett’s secretary Debbie Bosanek, whose effective tax rate is higher than her boss’s and helped inspire the Obama administration’s proposed “Buffett rule” to raise taxes on the wealthy that recently failed in Congress. Bosanek was shown with her feet up on her desk, discussing magazine covers. A helpful Buffett fielded phone calls for her.

The question of who will succeed Buffett, now 81, as chief executive has long been a focus of shareholders, and became more of an imperative after Buffett disclosed the diagnosis last month. Buffett has said the condition is not life-threatening and should not have much effect on his work. But the diagnosis has reminded shareholders that Buffett, for all his success as an investor and all the plaudits he receives, is mortal and would be very hard to replace. That made the future of Berkshire, with or without Buffett, a key focus of questioning at the company’s annual meeting in downtown Omaha, Nebraska. “I don’t think that every deal that I made would necessarily be makeable by a successor, but they’ll bring other talents as well,” and needs the skills to be an effective chief risk officer, Buffett said. He nonetheless assured: “We’re not going to have an arts major in charge of Berkshire.” Among the internal candidates seen as possible future Berkshire chief executives are Ajit Jain, Buffett’s top insurance lieutenant; Matthew Rose, who runs the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad company; and Greg Abel, who oversees the utility company MidAmerican Energy. Tony Nicely, who runs the Geico auto insurance unit, has long been seen as a candidate, but is now in his late 60s.

268,BRKa,Buffett tries to assure on Berkshire succession,"* Buffett says CEO successor needs ability to manage risk * Berkshire bulks up on reinsurance in disaster-hit countries * Buffett speaks at Berkshire annual meeting By Ben Berkowitz OMAHA, Neb., May 5 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett assured shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc  that the company will be in good hands after he steps down, trying to allay fears about Berkshire’s succession plan after revealing he had prostate cancer. The question of who will succeed Buffett, now 81, as chief executive has long been a focus of shareholders, and became more of an imperative after Buffett disclosed the diagnosis last month. Buffett has said the condition is not life-threatening and should not have much effect on his work. But the diagnosis has reminded shareholders that Buffett, for all his success as an investor and all the plaudits he receives, is mortal and would be very hard to replace. That made the future of Berkshire, with or without Buffett, a key focus of questioning at the company’s annual meeting in downtown Omaha, Nebraska. “I don’t think that every deal that I made would necessarily be makeable by a successor, but they’ll bring other talents as well,” and needs the skills to be an effective chief risk officer, Buffett said. He nonetheless assured: “We’re not going to have an arts major in charge of Berkshire.” For highlights from the meeting, expected to be attended by close to 40,000 shareholders, please click Among the internal candidates seen as possible future Berkshire chief executives are Ajit Jain, Buffett’s top insurance lieutenant; Matthew Rose, who runs the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad company; and Greg Abel, who oversees the utility company MidAmerican Energy. Tony Nicely, who runs the Geico auto insurance unit, has long been seen as a candidate, but is now in his late 60s. Buffett has also hired two portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, to handle portions of Berkshire’s investment portfolio.

269,BRKa,"Buffett plays down health concern, mulled megadeal","OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - Warren Buffett tried to allay fears of Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders about the company’s future after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, and revealed that he recently tried to make one of the biggest acquisitions of his storied career. The question of who will succeed Buffett, 81, as chief executive became more of an imperative after Buffett disclosed the diagnosis on April 17. While Buffett called it “a really minor event,” his early-stage prostate cancer was a reminder that for all his success as an investor and all the plaudits he gets, Buffett is mortal and would be hard to replace at the company he has run since 1965. That made the future of Berkshire (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N), with or without Buffett, a central focus of five hours of questions at its annual meeting on Saturday in downtown Omaha, Nebraska. “I don’t think that every deal that I made would necessarily be makeable by a successor, but they’ll bring other talents,” including skills to be an effective chief risk officer, Buffett said. “We’re not going to have an arts major in charge of Berkshire.” Charlie Munger, who is Berkshire’s 88-year-old vice chairman and sat beside Buffett, quipped: “I rather resent all this sympathy and attention that Warren is getting. I probably have more prostate cancer than he does.” The annual meeting is the centerpiece of a weekend of events that Buffett has dubbed “Woodstock for Capitalism.” Close to 40,000 shareholders were expected to attend this year. Buffett on Saturday also said that he recently considered a more than $20 billion acquisition, and would have sold some Berkshire stock holdings he wanted to keep to get it done. “I wish we could have made it,” he said. “It could happen. I don’t think it will happen.” Buffett did not name the target. A takeover of that magnitude would have been close in size to Berkshire’s biggest takeover - the $26.5 billion purchase of railroad company Burlington Northern Santa Fe in 2010. It would have also dented Berkshire’s $37.83 billion cash hoard. Buffett said he wants to keep $20 billion on hand. “Ideally we would spend about $20 billion, that would be about as much as I would feel comfortable spending now,” Buffett told Reuters Insider in an interview after the meeting ended. “I would settle for about $10 billion and don’t try me with $5 (billion).” Berkshire has about 80 operating units, which sell such things as car insurance, chemicals, clothing, furniture and ice cream. WAL-MART, POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS This year’s meeting had fewer fireworks than the 2011 meeting, which was dominated by the then-recent, scandal-driven resignation of Buffett heir apparent David Sokol. Yet Buffett offered a blunt assessment on a scandal enveloping Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), in which Berkshire held a $2.33 billion common stock stake at year end. Last month, the New York Times said the retailer’s majority-owned Wal-Mart de Mexico WALMEXV.MX unit ran a widespread bribery campaign in that country to win market dominance, and that senior Wal-Mart executives tried to cover it up. “If you read the New York Times story, and there’s always another side to it, it looks like they may well have made a mistake in how that was handled,” Buffett said. He nonetheless said he did not believe the matter “changes the fundamental dynamic” about Wal-Mart or its earnings power. Among the internal candidates seen as possible future Berkshire chief executives are Ajit Jain, Buffett’s top insurance lieutenant; Matthew Rose, who leads Burlington Northern; and Greg Abel, who runs the MidAmerican Energy unit. Tony Nicely, who runs the Geico auto insurance unit, has long been seen as a candidate, but is now in his late 60s. “I virtually know that the successor we have in mind ... has the culture and the people embedded as I do,” Buffett said. Buffett has also hired two portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, to handle some of Berkshire’s investments. He said each was recently given another $1 billion to invest, boosting their portfolios to $2.75 billion each. The meeting took place one day after Berkshire said first-quarter profit more than doubled, as its insurance business was spared the huge losses that natural disasters in Australia, Japan and New Zealand caused a year earlier. Buffett even said that Berkshire is writing “a lot more” reinsurance in those countries, as well as in Thailand. He was also upbeat about Berkshire’s prospects, despite slow U.S. economic growth and the inability of the United States and other countries to get their fiscal houses in order. “I would stay away from medium- or long-term government bonds, our own or those of other countries,” he said. Buffett also said that despite his huge investment in International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), which topped $11.7 billion at year end, he would not plunge into other technology giants such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Google Inc (GOOG.O). “The chances of being way wrong in IBM are probably less, at least for us,” than in Google or Apple, Buffett said. Though Berkshire shares have lagged broader stock and insurance stock indexes in recent months, shareholder enthusiasm at the meeting does not appear to have flagged. “(The) stock is a home run over the next five years,” said Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management in Seattle. Berkshire did not repurchase shares in the first quarter, and Buffett said he would be comfortable repurchasing stock at a price of 1.1 times book value, and perhaps higher. Buffett also said Berkshire may buy more newspapers. It owns the Buffalo News, just bought the hometown Omaha World-Herald, and is a longtime shareholder of Washington Post Co WPO.N. As in recent years, Buffett and Munger fielded questions from shareholders and three journalists. For the first time, they also took questions from three insurance industry analysts - Barclays Capital’s Jay Gelb, KBW’s Cliff Gallant, and Dowling & Partners’ Gary Ransom - who each have the equivalent of a “buy” rating on Berkshire. While some hoped the analysts would add depth to the meeting, some of their questions concerned relatively arcane matters such as mortality rates in insurance, or whether Geico would use electronics to track driver behavior. Gelb did ask the question that prompted Buffett’s comment about a mega-takeover. Prior to the questioning, shareholders were regaled with the annual comedy-infused movie made by Buffett’s daughter Susie. In one sketch, Buffett sang and played the ukulele with the cast of the TV show “Glee.” Another featured Buffett’s secretary Debbie Bosanek, whose effective tax rate is higher than her boss’s and helped inspire the Obama administration’s proposed “Buffett rule” to raise taxes on the wealthy that recently failed in Congress. Bosanek was shown with her feet up on her desk, discussing magazine covers. A helpful Buffett fielded phone calls for her. Buffett told Reuters Insider he expects some version of the “Buffett rule” would be passed in a second Obama administration.

270,BRKa,Warren Buffett says buying stocks amid market dip,"(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc is adding to its shareholdings of two U.S. companies amid a market dip, billionaire investor Warren Buffett said on Monday. Buffett, Berkshire’s controlling shareholder, also forecast record results this year for Berkshire’s largest non-insurance businesses, among the railroad BNSF and utility MidAmerican. Berkshire class B shares led the insurance sector to close 1.9 percent higher at $82.47 on Monday. In an interview on cable television network CNBC from just outside his conglomerate’s home base in Omaha, Nebraska, he dismissed the dip in European shares after weekend elections in France and Greece. “It’s going to be very, very difficult to resolve their problems,” he said of the euro zone countries, but he insisted they would do so eventually. Buffett declined to identify the two portfolio stocks Berkshire was purchasing more of. He said Berkshire spent $60 million buying stocks last Friday and would buy more on Monday. It was not clear if the $60 million was spent on just two stocks. Over the weekend, Berkshire held its annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, a festival that draws nearly 40,000 people for an hours-long question-and-answer session with Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger. It was during that session that Buffett revealed he had very nearly made an acquisition of more than $22 billion recently, which would have been one of his biggest ever. The 81-year-old Buffett, recently diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer, spent much of the day assuring shareholders he was in good health. Barclays Capital analyst Jay Gelb, who participated in one of the Q-and-A panels, said in a note to clients Monday that Berkshire appeared to be worth at least $118 per class B share. While Buffett has his acolytes, not everyone was impressed with his performance. Australian hedge fund manager John Hempton, in a post on his blog on Saturday, said the day was full of the usual questions on politics, economics and the like. “I got all this — and for the most part I got the usual homily answers. (The same questions were asked last year and the year before and the year before that. Answers can be got from meeting notes),” Hempton wrote. During the CNBC interview, Buffett reiterated his support for Wal-Mart Stores Inc, saying a scandal over bribe payments in Mexico did not change his opinion of the stock.

277,BRKa,Coty raises Avon bid with Buffett's blessing,"(Reuters) - With the help of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), fragrance maker Coty raised its bid for Avon by 6.5 percent to $10.65 billion and set a four-day deadline for the cosmetics company to start talks. That leaves the Avon board and Sheri McCoy with a big decision to make just two weeks into her job as chief executive of Avon Products Inc (AVP.N). The board previously rejected Coty’s offer on the grounds that a turnaround under a new CEO would be more valuable than a buyout. The board did not reject the new bid, saying only that it would consider it in due course. Coty, maker of Stetson aftershave and Beyoncé fragrances, first publicly offered to buy Avon, which has three times its revenue, for $23.25 per share in April. Avon shares rose as high as $23.57 in mid-April. Avon shares closed 3.3 percent lower at $20.89 on Thursday — about 15.6 percent below the latest offer of $24.75 per share — indicating that investors were not betting on a deal. “I don’t think they will (take up the offer). They know that the current bid is too cheap,” said Michael Bigger, founder of trading firm Bigger Capital, which holds Avon shares. “Cosmetics is a great business. It deserves a premium. If I were them, I would ask for $28 or more.” Privately held Coty also repeated in a letter to Avon’s board, dated May 9, that it would not go hostile. Avon’s stance thus far has left some shareholders disappointed. John Lamie, an Avon shareholder who worked in the company’s product development in the 1970s and would be willing to sell his shares for $28, said, “I think they have a responsibility to talk.” Avon, the world’s largest direct seller of cosmetics, could see its shares sink if it ignores Coty. “Absent a takeout, (Avon) shares are likely to return to high-teens levels,” Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Astrachan wrote in a research note. In the letter, Coty Chairman Bart Becht said equity financing sources include Coty’s main shareholder, Joh. A. Benckiser, BDT Capital Partners and some of its limited partners, and Berkshire Hathaway. Coty said J.P. Morgan Securities would provide debt financing. Berkshire Hathaway would provide $2.5 billion of the financing, according to a person familiar with the matter. “Coty can’t wait around for too long. They have to get on with their business,” said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj. “The risk is that the deadline is very short.” While Coty has previously said it had strong sources for its financing, Thursday was the first time Berkshire was mentioned by name. BDT Capital Partners, founded by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) partner and long-time Buffett confidant Byron Trott, and privately held Joh. A. Benckiser have been known since the beginning. It appears other financing, from Coty’s main shareholder, was also recently lined up. On Wednesday the Reimann family’s JAB Holdings BV, which is also Reckitt Benckiser’s (RB.L) biggest shareholder, said it intended to sell about 4.9 percent of its stake in British consumer goods group Reckitt to reduce its total holding to 10.4 percent. One reason given was to invest in new opportunities. Fitch put Avon on a negative ratings watch, pending the outcome of talks between Avon and Coty. Avon’s senior unsecured debt is currently rated BBB-, with a stable outlook. Fitch pointed out that Coty has said before that it wants to keep a combined company at investment grade. It also noted that Berkshire has a history of supporting investment-grade companies and typically is not involved in leveraged transactions. Moody’s Investors Service said in a statement on Thursday afternoon that it was lowering its long-term ratings on Avon to Baa1 from A3. McCoy, a former Johnson & Johnson executive, joined Avon as its CEO on April 23, replacing Andrea Jung, who had held the job for 12 years. McCoy told investors in her first public comments as CEO last week that her priority was to stabilize Avon’s business ahead of an in-depth review. Coty said on Thursday it was willing to raise its bid further, provided it was given access to Avon’s financial records and then decided a higher offer was warranted. It repeated that before it could raise the offer any higher, it needs to understand the financial implications of the U.S. probe into whether Avon broke antibribery laws to win licenses overseas. Coty also said it needs a closer look at Avon’s business to get a sense of potential savings from combining the businesses and to see how it can make selling Avon more lucrative for its representatives. Such due diligence would take “a few weeks,” Becht said in the letter. Last week, Avon reported weak first-quarter results, including a sharp drop in profit. Avon has said it will conduct a thorough business review this year, but Coty said in its letter it could not give Avon all that time. “We continue to believe that our proposal would provide compelling value to Avon’s shareholders relative to a difficult and uncertain multi-year turnaround on a stand-alone basis,” Becht said in the letter to Avon’s board. The companies first met to informally discuss a tie-up in February, initially exploring having Avon buy Coty. Becht last month said that when no offer came from Avon, Coty made a verbal offer, followed by three letters in March.

278,BRKa,"Berkshire adds GM, Viacom positions in first quarter","(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway added new positions in automaker General Motors and media conglomerate Viacom in the first quarter and cut its stake in chipmaker Intel by 33 percent, the conglomerate said in a quarterly holdings statement on Tuesday. Berkshire also boosted its position in Wal-Mart Stores by 20 percent in the first quarter, just before news broke of a bribery scandal involving the company’s Mexican unit. The ice-cream-to-insurance conglomerate is the retailer’s fifth-largest shareholder. At Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting earlier this month, Warren Buffett defended Wal-Mart, saying the scandal did not change his opinion of the company. But the GM and Viacom stakes were both relatively smaller - $256.5 million and $75.5 million, respectively - which suggest they were the work of the company’s new investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, rather than Buffett himself. Berkshire has a limited history with automakers, though the company does have a substantial investment in the Chinese electric car maker BYD Co Ltd. The Intel position is one Combs added in the third quarter of last year and expanded in the fourth quarter, making the quick reduction somewhat unexpected. Tech is another category Berkshire never favored, notwithstanding the recent huge bet in IBM. Tuesday’s filing was the first peek into the investment strategy of Weschler, who joined Berkshire earlier this year to be the company’s second money manager, along with Combs, who was hired in 2010. Weschler’s influence was already evident in the fourth quarter, though, when Berkshire added two of his favorite names, kidney dialysis provider DaVita and media holding company Liberty Media. They were the third- and fourth-largest holdings in Weschler’s now-closed fund. In the most recent quarter, Berkshire more than doubled its position in DaVita and nearly doubled its stake in Liberty. Combs and Weschler run $2.75 billion each now but will jointly manage Berkshire’s entire portfolio when Warren Buffett retires. In order to make them work more closely together, Buffett has said each man gets paid in some part based on how the other’s portfolio does. Among other notable moves, Berkshire raised its stake in bank Wells Fargo by 3 percent and more than doubled its position in BNY Mellon. Berkshire also closed out of a position in Comdisco Holding and trimmed its position in Procter & Gamble by 5 percent.

They were the third- and fourth-largest holdings in Weschler’s now-closed fund. In the most recent quarter, Berkshire more than doubled its position in DaVita and nearly doubled its stake in Liberty. Combs and Weschler run $2.75 billion each now but will jointly manage Berkshire’s entire portfolio when Warren Buffett retires. In order to make them work more closely together, Buffett has said each man gets paid in some part based on how the other’s portfolio does. Among other notable moves, Berkshire raised its stake in bank Wells Fargo by 3 percent and more than doubled its position in BNY Mellon. Berkshire also closed out of a position in Comdisco Holding  and trimmed its position in Procter & Gamble by 5 percent.",5152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-holdings/berkshire-adds-gm-viacom-positions-in-1st-qtr-idUSL1E8GE34U20120515
280,BRKa,UPDATE 4-Coty withdraws $10.7 bln offer to buy Avon,"* Coty says Avon took too long * Bid had backing from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway * Avon shares had been hammered prior to Coty’s bid By Phil Wahba May 15 (Reuters) - Fragrance company Coty Inc withdrew its $10.7 billion takeover bid for Avon Products Inc on Monday, saying the world’s largest cosmetics direct seller had missed a deadline to start discussing a deal that Coty first proposed in March. The move leaves Avon shareholders relying on new Chief Executive Sheri McCoy to come up with a plan to turn around a company that has been suffering from plummeting profits on  falling sales at home and in some international markets, as well as a stock price that had been hammered prior to Coty’s bid. Coty last week raised its unsolicited bid, which had the financial backing of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway   and others, to $24.75 per share from an earlier $23.25 per share offer, and gave Avon a Monday deadline to respond. Avon, which had rejected outright all of Coty’s earlier bids without entering into discussions, said on Sunday in a two-sentence statement that it would look at Coty’s latest offer but  respond within a week. “Avon Products responded promptly to Coty’s May 9 letter by disclosing it on May 10 and indicating that its board would consider the contents of the letter,” Avon said in a statement early on Tuesday. However, on May 14, five days after sending its letter, Coty withdrew its proposal, Avon said. Coty, known for fragrances for celebrities like Madonna and Beyoncé, said that no one on Avon’s board or senior management, including McCoy, returned its request for an explanation of why Avon needed more time to consider the bid. “Your total lack of engagement with us leads us to believe that you remain reluctant to explore a friendly, negotiated combination on a reasonable timetable,” Coty Chairman Bart Becht said in a letter to Avon dated Monday and made public. “Two months is enough.” Avon did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment. Coty’s reaction - take our offer by the deadline or we walk away - is consistent with how Buffett has approached dealmaking in the past. He has always been clear that Berkshire does not get into bidding wars; it makes what it considers a fair offer and that bid is either taken or not. That was most recently seen last year with an offer by Berkshire’s National Indemnity insurance unit for reinsurer Transatlantic. Amid a bidding war by other parties, Berkshire came in with a firm cash offer. It set a deadline, and when that deadline passed Berkshire simply withdrew its bid and went on its way. A number of Avon shareholders had told Reuters in recent weeks that Coty’s offers were too low but that they wanted Avon to at least meet with Coty. Coty, which made its desire to buy Avon known to the public for the first time in April, had said from the start it had no intention of making a hostile bid for Avon, which has close to three times as much revenue as Coty. Avon had rejected Coty’s offers, arguing that they were too low and that the company’s value could rise more from a turnaround led by a new CEO. Avon shares had fallen 38.8 percent between the time they hit a 52-week high on May 16, 2011 and March 30, the last session before Coty went public with its overtures. Avon, is facing declining sales and a loss of sales representatives. Earlier this month, Avon reported weak first-quarter results, including a sharp drop in profits. Avon has been bedeviled by heavy competition from drugstores in the United States, aggressive pricing by rivals in Eastern Europe and inadequate ordering systems that have frustrated representatives in Brazil, its biggest market. The company has poured tens of millions into an internal probe into whether it broke the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to build its business overseas. The U.S. government announced its own investigation last year. Coty had said that before it could raise the offer any higher, it needed access to Avon’s books to understand the financial implications of the U.S. probe as well as to get a sense of potential savings from combining the businesses. When McCoy spoke to shareholders at Avon’s annual meeting on May 3, she said her first priority was to stabilize the business. McCoy, a former Johnson & Johnson executive, took the reins as CEO last month. She will conduct a thorough business review this year. Fragrances accounted for 57 percent of Coty’s $4.1 billion in sales in its year ended June 2011. The bulk of its sales come from Europe and North America. A tie-up would have given it access to developing markets such as Brazil, Russia and Mexico, and deepened its roster of products. The companies first met to informally discuss a deal in February, initially exploring having Avon buy Coty. Becht last month said that when no offer came from Avon, Coty made a verbal offer, followed by three letters in March. Its original offer was for $22.25 per share. Coty had lined up equity financing from several parties, including Coty’s main shareholder, Joh. A. Benckiser, BDT Capital Partners and some of its limited partners, and Berkshire Hathaway. Coty had said J.P. Morgan Securities would provide debt financing. Berkshire Hathaway would provide $2.5 billion of the financing, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters last week. Shares of Avon closed up 77 cents on Monday at $20.96 on the New York Stock Exchange. Coty revealed its decision after U.S. markets closed.",5152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/avon-coty/update-4-coty-withdraws-10-7-bln-offer-to-buy-avon-idUSL1E8GF0HV20120515
281,BRKa,Warren Buffett to buy Media General newspapers,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc is boosting its bet on the newspaper industry, with a deal to buy the majority of Media General Inc’s papers for $142 million in cash, making him one of the largest publishers in the United States. The deal announced Thursday means Buffett will have a stable of about 25 daily newspapers across the country. Buffett is staking his claim in an industry dogged by plummeting advertising revenue and readers who are choosing digital formats over paper and ink. Newspapers, once the toast of investors looking for stable cash-generating companies to park their money, have lost favor over the last several years. The move is a classic turn for the chairman of the ice-cream-to-insurance conglomerate who is always on the hunt for a good value. He told his Berkshire shareholders in May that he was going to spend more money on newspapers because he still views them as the primary source for local information. Berkshire will also lend Media General $400 million and provide a $45 million credit line. Media General will issue warrants for approximately 4.6 million Class A shares, representing 19.9 percent of its existing shares outstanding. Media General’s stock soared 38.2 percent to $4.34 a share in midday trade, touching its highest level in six weeks. The company said in February it was exploring the sale of its papers. Its 63 daily and weekly newspapers are scattered throughout the U.S. Southeast and include the Richmond Times-Dispatch. They will be operated under BH Media Group, a new subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway. The sale does not include newspapers in Media General’s Tampa division, which will be sold separately. The Poynter Institute’s Rick Edmonds said that without the Tampa paper, the group Berkshire bought is probably “modestly profitable.” When the Media General deal is complete, Buffett’s stable of daily papers will have a total weekday circulation of around 800,000. Berkshire already owns the Buffalo News, the Omaha World-Herald Co and a stake in the Washington Post Co. The conglomerate also reportedly holds a small stake in the recently reorganized newspaper chain Lee Enterprises. With the Media General deal, Buffett will own, outright or in large part, three of the top 10 newspapers in the country by market penetration, according to the Pew Research Center. But none of the papers that Berkshire owns directly are in the top 25 nationwide by circulation, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, which one analyst said fits with Buffett’s strategy. “Berkshire Hathaway is clearly (taking) a vote of confidence in small-town local newspapers. They didn’t buy the big city newspaper Tampa Tribune, which is struggling,” said Benchmark Capital analyst Edward Atorino. “They’re basically giving Media General a lease on life here. This is chump change, but Berkshire Hathaway doesn’t fool around. I don’t think Berkshire Hathaway does anything where they’re going to lose money.” Media General is the latest newspaper company with a heavy debt load to turn to a mogul for help. The New York Times Co took a $250 million loan with about 14 percent interest from Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, which the company has since paid back. Slim also received warrants in the deal. Buffett is paying slightly less for the Media General papers than he paid late last year for his hometown paper, the World-Herald. That deal included six other dailies and several weeklies in Nebraska and Iowa. That deal raised eyebrows, as it looked to some to be more like a rescue of a local business with a clouded financial picture than a long-term investment. Many also pointed to his highly skeptical comments in his 2007 letter to shareholders. “When an industry’s underlying economics are crumbling, talented management may slow the rate of decline. Eventually, though, eroding fundamentals will overwhelm managerial brilliance,” he said in discussing the shrinking profits at his first newspaper holding, the Buffalo News. But Buffett was adamant that the World-Herald deal was “reasonable,” and told shareholders earlier this month they were likely to see him do more. “We may buy more newspapers. I think the economics work out OK,” Buffett said at Berkshire’s annual meeting on May 5. One Berkshire investor said the deal fits Buffett’s value model, which has drawn him into a wide range of acquisitions — from railroads and chemical companies to jewelers and alcohol distributors. “Buffett sees the transition away from free content as an ultimate boost to profit margins. The companies are very undervalued if they attain even low single-digit earnings growth. I would compare this to his purchase of gas pipelines in the Enron fire sale in 2002,” said Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management in Seattle. The new holding entity, BH Media Group, also includes the World-Herald papers. Terry Kroeger, formerly CEO of the World-Herald Co, is president of the group. It was not clear where or even whether the Buffalo News fits into the new entity. Buffett’s assistant was not immediately available to comment. With the nearly 20 percent stake in Media General, Buffett also gets a foot back into the broadcast television business, an industry he knows well. After the newspaper sale, the remaining Media General will be mostly a TV company, with a number of NBC affiliates. In the 1980s, Buffett helped Capital Cities finance its purchase of the ABC television network and for years remained one of its key shareholders.

284,BRKa,Buffett tried to buy ResCap before bankruptcy: report,"(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett sought to buy Residential Capital (ResCap) from Ally Financial before the U.S. auto and mortgage lender put its home-lending unit into bankruptcy, Bloomberg said, citing three persons familiar with the matter. The news agency said Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) controlling shareholder, appointed investment manager Ted Weschler for talks with Ally, quoting the persons who preferred anonymity. Under the deal, Berkshire Hathaway would have taken on potential liabilities such as increasing litigation costs and other claims, while paying nothing upfront for ResCap’s assets. Buffett sought to avoid a ResCap bankruptcy filing because Berkshire had unsecured debt in the mortgage unit, the financial website said citing the persons. Bloomberg’s sources said Ally turned down Weschler’s deal, and decided to file for bankruptcy instead, to avoid future liabilities. “We are confident in the bankruptcy court-supervised bidding process, which is designed to ensure that the ResCap estate receives the best possible combination of price and terms for its assets in a court-approved transaction,” ResCap spokesperson Susan Fitzpatrick told Reuters in an e-mail. Residential Capital filed for bankruptcy protection in federal court in Manhattan last week. At the same time, Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc (NSM.N), which is majority-owned by Fortress Investment Group LLC FIG.N, struck a deal to buy substantially all the mortgage-servicing and related assets from ResCap for about $2.4 billion, including debt. Ally has been besieged in the past few years by losses at ResCap, once a major subprime lender and profit engine.

286,BRKa,UPDATE 1-Warren Buffett eyes more newspapers - report,"May 24 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc  is eyeing more newspapers, according to a memo posted on Jim Romenesko’s media website. The Oracle of Omaha wrote in a memo to Berkshire Hathaway’s publishers and editors that “Berkshire will probably purchase more papers in the next few years,” according to the website. Buffett’s company announced on May 17 that it would buy the majority of Media General Inc’s papers for $142 million in cash and that it would form a new subsidiary called BH Media Group. In the memo, Buffett said, “we will favor towns and cities with a strong sense of community, comparable to the 26 in which we will soon operate.” Buffett reassured editors and publishers he would not push any political agenda:  “I have some strong political views, but Berkshire owns the paper - I don’t. And Berkshire will always be non-political.” A call to a Berkshire Hathaway representative was not immediately returned. Buffett’s love of newspapers is well-known though he is choosy about where he sends his affections. He favors small and medium-sized newspapers in thriving towns rather than big city metros. Indeed, Berkshire snapped up 63 daily and weekly newspapers of Media General but left behind the troubled Tampa Tribune and its related properties. “I believe newspapers that intensively cover their communities will have a good future,” he wrote in the memo. Berkshire already owns the Buffalo News, the Omaha World-Herald Co and a stake in the Washington Post Co. The conglomerate also reportedly holds a small stake in the recently reorganized newspaper chain Lee Enterprises. Buffett is making a bet on an industry that is dogged by plummeting advertising revenue and readers who are getting their news in digital formats instead of paper and ink. His appetite for more newspapers comes amid reports that the Newhouse family’s Advance Publications plans on cutting the frequency of the New Orleans Times-Picayune and is forming a separate company for its Louisiana papers.

290,BRKa,UPDATE 1-Berkshire seeks independent examiner in ResCap case,"* Berkshire says ResCap’s pre-bankruptcy deals with Ally are “potentially improper” * Creditor committee had asked for permission to investigate transactions By Tanya Agrawal June 5 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc  has asked a U.S. court to appoint an independent examiner in the Residential Capital LLC (ResCap) bankruptcy case to investigate some transactions between the company and its parent. Berkshire, a major ResCap creditor which tried to buy the company before it filed for bankruptcy, termed the transactions with Ally Financial Inc “potentially improper” and said the examiner should evaluate potential claims arising from them. ResCap, which is Ally Financial’s mortgage unit, filed for bankruptcy protection last month. Ally, the former in-house financing arm for General Motors Co, had said it would sell some international operations to help repay $12 billion in U.S. government bailout money. As part of the bankruptcy filing, ResCap reached a $750 million settlement with Ally that would release the parent company from mortgage-backed securities lawsuits. Last week, a committee of the company’s unsecured creditors had asked for permission to investigate transactions that ResCap entered into with Ally before it filed for bankruptcy protection. However, Berkshire said the committee’s members have potentially conflicting interests over matters that require investigation and that an examiner could access communications between ResCap and its counsel. In a bankruptcy case, an examiner investigates allegations such as dishonesty, fraud, incompetence and mismanagement. Berkshire holds more than $500 million or 50 percent of total outstanding unsecured bonds and $900 million or 40 percent of total outstanding junior secured bonds issued by ResCap, according to a declaration filed by Ted Weschler, an investment manager at Berkshire, late on Monday. Berkshire said ResCap had engaged in several deals with Ally worth billions of dollars whose net effect was to transfer a significant share of ResCap’s operating assets to its parent. ResCap now seeks to release Ally from any claims arising from these transactions even while the mortgage lender admits that it possess valid claims against Ally for “fraudulent transfer”, Berkshire said. “ResCap’s plan fits neatly into Ally’s publicly-stated goal of separating itself, once and for all, from ResCap. Whether Ally’s agenda also happens to be in the best interest of ResCap and its creditors is another question,” Berkshire said in its petition. Reports by court-appointed independent examiners have been given importance by courts in recent bankruptcy cases. In the Lehman bankruptcy case, the court-appointed examiner found that the failed bank’s use of so-called Repo 105 transactions, in which assets were moved on and off the balance sheet, let it obscure its leverage and health. The report was cited in a securities fraud lawsuit against the company and its top executives. More recently, power producer Dynegy Inc was forced to settle with creditors who had complained that Dynegy shielded assets from them before putting a unit into bankruptcy. A bankruptcy examiner had issued a scathing report that bolstered their position. Ally has been besieged in the past few years by losses at ResCap, once a major subprime lender and its profit engine. The company had considered bankruptcy for ResCap and other ways to shed the unit in the past. Ally did not return calls seeking comment.

ResCap now seeks to release Ally from any claims arising from these transactions even while the mortgage lender admits that it possess valid claims against Ally for “fraudulent transfer”, Berkshire said. “ResCap’s plan fits neatly into Ally’s publicly-stated goal of separating itself, once and for all, from ResCap. Whether Ally’s agenda also happens to be in the best interest of ResCap and its creditors is another question,” Berkshire said in its petition. Ally has been besieged in the past few years by losses at ResCap, once a major subprime lender and its profit engine. The company has considered bankruptcy for ResCap and other ways to shed the unit in the past.

293,BRKa,Berkshire sells some ResCap debt as it seeks probe,"* Berkshire says sells more than $500 mln unsecured bonds * Berkshire owns more than $900 mln junior secured bonds * Appointment of examiner has been sought * ResCap, an Ally mortgage unit, sought bankruptcy on May 14 June 8 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc   sold more than a third of its Residential Capital LLC bond holdings this week, shortly after calling for a probe into the mortgage lender’s pre-bankruptcy transactions. Ted Weschler, a Berkshire investment manager, said his company sold its holdings of more than $500 million of unsecured ResCap bonds on June 5 and 6, according to papers filed Thursday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Weschler did not disclose sale prices. Berkshire had held the bonds for several years. The sales followed Weschler’s June 4 request for the court to appoint an independent examiner to investigate “potentially improper” transactions, in which ResCap moved large amounts of assets to its parent, Ally Financial Inc. Berkshire still owns more than $900 million of ResCap’s junior secured bonds, or more than 40 percent of the total, Weschler said in the court filing. The bond sales do not affect Berkshire’s capacity to demand an examiner, who works for the benefit of creditors and the bankruptcy estate and may investigate allegations such as dishonesty, fraud, incompetence and mismanagement. A committee of unsecured ResCap creditors has also requested authority to investigate transactions that the lender conducted prior to its Chapter 11 filing on May 14. Ally, the former General Motors in-house financing arm, did not seek court protection from creditors. The U.S. government owns nearly 74 percent of Ally.

294,BRKa,Berkshire seeking to buy ResCap mortgage unit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) has offered to buy Residential Capital LLC’s RESC.UL mortgage unit, according to court papers filed Monday. In throwing its hat in the ring, Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Buffett’s holding company, is seeking to replace Nationstar Mortgage Holdings (NSM.N), owned by Fortress Investment Group FIG.N, as the initial bidder for the bankrupt company’s mortgage servicing unit. ResCap, the mortgage unit of Ally Financial GKM.N, filed for bankruptcy in May with a plan to sell the unit to Nationstar for about $2.4 billion. Ally is the former in-house financing arm for General Motors Co (GM.N), previously known as GMAC, and is not in bankruptcy. Berkshire, a major ResCap creditor, also offered to serve as the stalking-horse bidder for a portfolio of loans that ResCap had planned to sell to Ally for approximately $1.4 billion. The stalking-horse, or initial bidder, sets the minimum price, requiring other bidders at the auction to make higher counteroffers. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn is scheduled to consider the sale procedures on June 18. The auction is set for September, and ResCap CEO Tom Marano told Reuters last week that other bidders are likely to emerge in the coming weeks. In both cases, Berkshire said it would offer more attractive terms in papers filed in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan. Under a proposed deal with ResCap, Fortress would be entitled to a $72 million break-up fee and up to $10 million in expense reimbursement if it failed to win the auction. Berkshire offered to cut the break-up fee to $24 million and to eliminate the expense reimbursement. Earlier Monday, the U.S. Trustee overseeing the case, Hope Davis, criticized the size of the break-up fee, saying in court papers that it could discourage other bidders from participating. The U.S. Trustee monitors bankruptcy cases to ensure compliance with bankruptcy laws. Berkshire also topped the proposed bid from Ally, offering $1.45 billion, or $50 million more. Before the bankruptcy filing, Berkshire made a last-minute offer to buy ResCap assets for $1 in return for taking on its liabilities, according to a source familiar with the situation, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the talks. Ally turned down the offer, the source said. Spokeswomen for both Ally and ResCap declined to comment on the Berkshire filing. A spokesman for Fortress did not immediately return a request for comment after business hours Monday. Losses at ResCap, once a major subprime lender, have wounded Ally in recent years. The bankruptcy and sale are intended to give Ally a way to shed its mortgage liabilities as part of an effort to repay U.S. taxpayers for a series of bailouts during the financial crisis.

296,BRKa,"NetJets to buy Bombardier, Cessna planes worth $9.6 billion","(Reuters) - NetJets, a private jet-sharing company owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), said on Monday it would buy up to 425 new business jets from Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO) and Cessna in a deal worth $9.6 billion to expand its North American and European fleet. The purchase, which NetJets described as the largest in private aviation history, includes up to 275 Bombardier Challenger business aircraft, the second time in 15 months that NetJets has placed a large order with the Canadian planemaker. The Bombardier portion of the order, which is valued at $7.3 billion, is made up of 100 firm orders on two different types of Challenger jets, and options for 175 more, NetJets said. Deliveries of the different jets will start in 2014 and 2015. “This is a very sizable order,” said PI Financial airlines analyst Chris Murray. “Bombardier’s aerospace group usually does about $10 billion a year. This will be several years worth of business,” he said. NetJets also said in a statement that it placed an order for 150 Cessna Citation Latitude business aircraft, including 25 firm orders and options for 125 more. Deliveries begin in 2016. Cessna Aircraft Co, the world’s largest maker of business jets, is a subsidiary of Textron Inc (TXT.N). NetJets said the addition of the new aircraft, along with recently-ordered Embraer Phenoms and Bombardier Globals, marks the launch of a new NetJets “Signature Series” of aircraft — planes that it helped design from start to finish. “It’s a major step towards replacing their existing fleet, but it heavily depends on business jet demand and achieving a level of profitability that’s far from guaranteed,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Teal Group. “NetJets has a track record of placing orders that fall by the wayside, for market reasons or company reasons. But assuming the market firms up, it’s good news for Bombardier and Cessna,” he said. NetJets’ attraction for businessmen, entertainers and athletes has been the lure of owning access to a jet without the hassle of maintenance, crew, licensing and the like. For many years, NetJets was the problem child of Berkshire’s global portfolio of businesses, despite having a market share an estimated five times the size of its closest competitor. Over the last two years NetJets has turned around results, though, cutting its debt burden and swinging back to profitability. In February of this year, Buffett told investors that NetJets ended 2011 with an uptick in sales that was “more than seasonally normal,” a potential sign of an even greater rebound. Last March, Bombardier said it would sell as many as 120 large business jets from its Global series to NetJets in a deal it said at the time could be worth more than $6.7 billion.

298,BRKa,ResCap wins court OK on operations; bidders emerge,"* Bankruptcy court judge approves payments to employees * Judge says expects sale procedures at June 18 hearing * Berkshire Hathaway, Lone Star signal interest in assets By Caroline Humer NEW YORK, June 12 (Reuters) - Residential Capital LLC  received another round of court approvals on Tuesday that will enable it to operate in bankruptcy, while competing bidders stepped in for its mortgage loan and servicing businesses. At a hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, Judge Martin Glenn gave final approval to ResCap to allow it to continue paying employees and using its cash to pay other bills. Glenn also said he still expects to be presented with ResCap’s proposed procedures for the asset sales at a June 18 hearing unless the company decides to delay the request. “I know it’s a moving target because additional offers are coming in,” Glenn said. ResCap filed for bankruptcy last month with a plan in place for Nationstar Mortgage Holdings, owned by Fortress Investment Group, to make a $2.4 billion minimum offer for the mortgage servicing assets. Ally Financial, the parent company of ResCap, also agreed to buy a group of ResCap mortgage loans for $1.4 billion. Ally is not in bankruptcy. Late on Monday, billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and Lone Star, an investment fund, said in court papers that they would be interested in buying one or both of the businesses. Berkshire is a major creditor of ResCap. ResCap spokeswoman Susan Fitzpatrick declined to comment on the potential new bidders, as did representatives for Ally and Nationstar. Last week, ResCap CEO Tom Marano told Reuters that other bidders were likely to emerge in the coming weeks. During the hearing, a lawyer for ResCap’s official unsecured creditors committee, Kenneth Eckstein of Kramer Levin Naftalis, described the sales situation as “extremely fluid” and said the committee would need time to consider the new offers. The committee’s support is needed for the sales to move forward. Under its current plan, ResCap has agreed to pay a $72 million breakup fee and a $10 million expense reimbursement to Nationstar if its deal does not close. It also set a $25 million minimum bid increment for a higher bid. U.S. Trustee Tracy Hope Davis, who represents the U.S. Justice Department, objected to the bid procedures on Monday, saying they would discourage bidders. Berkshire offered to replace Nationstar as the minimum or “stalking horse” bidder, saying it would cut the breakup fee in half and eliminate the expense reimbursement. It also said it would top Ally’s offer for the mortgage loan business by $50 million. Lone Star said it would be willing to be the stalking horse for the assets now due to go to Ally and would want a breakup fee of $10 million to $20 million.

302,BRKa,Berkshire replaces unit CEO amid junket report,"* Benjamin Moore CEO Abrams replaced as of June 6 * NY Post says he took executives on Bermuda yacht trip * Berkshire does not comment on reasons for change By Ben Berkowitz June 15 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc  has changed chief executives at paint retailer Benjamin Moore, amid a published report that the former CEO used company funds to take top executives on an island jaunt. A spokeswoman for Benjamin Moore confirmed Denis Abrams was no longer running the 129-year-old company, which Berkshire acquired in late 2000. As of June 6 he was replaced by Bob Merritt, an outside executive. But the spokeswoman referred all questions about the reasons for the change to Berkshire headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska. Neither Buffett’s assistant nor his secretary returned requests for comment on the matter. Abrams could not immediately be reached for comment. One telephone number for him listed in public directories was incorrect and a second was not answered on Friday afternoon. The New York Post reported Friday that Berkshire executives traveled to Benjamin Moore headquarters in New Jersey last week and escorted Abrams from the building. Abrams and a group of Benjamin Moore executives went on a company-sponsored yacht trip in Bermuda to celebrate a rise in quarterly sales, the first in five years, the newspaper said. Berkshire struck a deal to buy Benjamin Moore in November 2000 for roughly $1 billion. Since the deal was made, though, Benjamin Moore has not been prominent in the Berkshire universe. Most years, it does not even rate a mention in the company’s annual letter to shareholders, in which Buffett commends certain of his CEOs for the work they have done. The company is sometimes overshadowed by the rest of Berkshire’s housing-related businesses, which suffered greatly during the financial crisis and are still struggling with the effects of the weak housing market. Buffett is more likely to talk about Shaw Carpet or Acme Brick, for example, than he is to bring up the paint business. Benjamin Moore sells its more than 3,300 paint colors through a network of independent retailers. The company employed nearly 2,300 people as of Dec. 31. Abrams’ departure is the second notable CEO issue for Buffett in a little more than a year. In the spring of 2011 the chief executive of Berkshire unit MidAmerican, David Sokol, left the company amid a stock-trading scandal, after buying shares in a company he was trying to convince Buffett to acquire. Sokol denied anything improper took place. Sokol was once seen as Buffett’s heir apparent, and more than a year later the probe around his departure is still costing Berkshire hundreds of thousands of dollars in regular legal fees. The Sokol episode cast a shadow on Buffett’s famously hands-off style. The 81-year-old “Oracle of Omaha” has bragged that he speaks to some of his CEOs just once a year.",6152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-benjaminmoore-ceo/berkshire-replaces-unit-ceo-amid-junket-report-idUSL1E8HF8GG20120615
303,BRKa,ResCap: Berkshire chose not to be part of pre-bankruptcy sale process,"June 15 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc , which has offered to buy key assets from Residential Capital LLC, chose not to take part in the process to sell the mortgage loan and servicing company when it was preparing to file for bankruptcy earlier this year, court documents show. It later proposed buying the company for $1.00, among other options, ResCap said. Berkshire, a major ResCap creditor, offered on Monday to buy ResCap’s mortgage servicing unit and serve as a “stalking-horse” - or initial - bidder for loans ResCap plans to sell to parent Ally Financial for about $1.4 billion. Berkshire earlier asked the court to appoint an independent examiner in the case to investigate some transactions between the company and Ally. ResCap filed for bankruptcy last month with a plan in place for Nationstar Mortgage Holdings, owned by Fortress Investment Group, to make a $2.4 billion minimum offer for its mortgage servicing assets. Ally, the former financing arm of General Motors Corp , is not in bankruptcy. In a separate filing, Ally said that as a “reluctant” bidder it had offered to buy ResCap’s legacy loan portfolio for $200 million more than if the sale occurred under a Chapter 11 plan. Ally said it would be “comfortable” withdrawing its higher purchase price if requested by ResCap or the court but that the removal of the offer may deprive ResCap of the opportunity to realize an additional $200 million of value for its estate. ResCap has hired Centerview Partners to determine the highest and best stalking-horse bidder for its assets. ResCap and Nationstar have already met with government agencies Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae to explain the sale process and get support for Nationstar’s potential purchase of ResCap’s assets. Samuel Greene, co-head of Centerview’s restructuring group, contacted Berkshire in January to be a part of the sale process, but Berkshire chose not to participate, ResCap said in court documents filed on Thursday. Berkshire also met with Ally Chief Executive Michael Carpenter in mid-April, the documents showed. Following that meeting, Ted Weschler of Berkshire said in a May 3 letter to ResCap that “neither ResCap entering into bankruptcy nor a sale of ResCap’s mortgage production platform is in the best interests of Ally, the U.S. Treasury, Berkshire and other significant stakeholders in both Ally and ResCap.” Instead, Berkshire submitted an alternative transaction proposing among other things that it buy ResCap for $1.00, ResCap said. ResCap said that at no time during discussions about the bankruptcy planning did Berkshire show any interest in being a part of the stalking horse process and that its actions were “atypical” of parties interested in becoming a stalking horse.

304,BRKa,UPDATE 1-Court appoints ResCap examiner; Berkshire raises bid,"* Berkshire had asked for examiner, raises its bid * Judge to consider sales plan procedures * Nationstar also raises bid to match Berkshire By Caroline Humer NEW YORK, June 18 (Reuters) - A U.S. bankruptcy judge said on Monday he would appoint an independent examiner to investigate the bankruptcy of home lender Residential Capital LLC, a move that was sought by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ResCap, the mortgage unit of Ally Financial, the former in-house financing arm of General Motors Co, filed for bankruptcy last month with a plan that included selling two groups of assets for about $4 billion to two buyers: Nationstar Mortgage Holdings and Ally. Berkshire Hathaway is seeking to overturn that process and buy some ResCap assets itself. One week after throwing its hat in the ring, Berkshire on Monday raised its offer for the mortgage loan operations by $50 million. Nationstar also raised its bid on Monday by $50 million, each putting their respective offers at $2.45 billion. Berkshire has said that some pre-bankruptcy financial transactions between ResCap and Ally were “potentially improper” in calling for the examiner appointment. Judge Martin Glenn said at a court hearing that “given the facts and circumstances of this case, the court concludes that appointment of an examiner is required and appropriate.” An examiner, who is typically a bankruptcy lawyer, will now be named and should complete a report “expeditiously,” Glenn said. In a bankruptcy, an examiner investigates allegations such as dishonesty, fraud, incompetence and mismanagement. Judges have previously appointed examiners in bankruptcy cases such as Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc and Dynegy Holdings, a unit Dynegy Inc. Lawyers for ResCap and its unsecured creditors committee said the examiner is not needed because the process would duplicate an investigation already under way by the creditors committee. They also said it could slow down the company’s reorganization plan. The sales plan includes plans for a September auction of the two businesses. Berkshire, a significant holder of ResCap’s debt, proposed last week that it be the opening, or “stalking-horse” bidder for ResCap’s mortgage loan operations. It also said it may be interested in buying some loans that ResCap is selling. Early on Monday, Berkshire raised its offer for the loan operations by $50 million in a bid to replace Nationstar as the minimum bidder for the business. Nationstar responded on Monday afternoon by increasing its own offer by $50 million and cutting its deal-related fees to Berkshire’s level. Glenn was expected to weigh in Monday on whether to move forward with the current sales plan in which Nationstar and Ally Financial will anchor an auction in September, or allow Berkshire to take Nationstar’s place. Nationstar’s initial offer, worked out during months of pre-bankruptcy negotiations, was $2.4 billion for the mortgage servicing assets. On Monday, it cut its proposed break-up fee - which must be paid if it is beat out by another buyer - to $24 million from $72 million and tossed out its plans for expense reimbursement of up to $10 million. That leveled the field with Berkshire’s offer, ResCap lawyer Larren Nashelsky of Morrison & Foerster said during the hearing. Other bidders are also stepping up. Ocwen Financial Corp  expects to join the bidding for Residential Capital LLC’s mortgage loan operations, its chief financial officer John Britti told Reuters in an interview recently. The Atlanta-based mortgage servicer could bid on its own but likely would work with partners, he said, adding that it expects to bid after a judge approves the sale procedures. In addition, Lone Star, an investment fund, reiterated during Monday’s hearing that it was interested in the group of loans that ResCap is selling and would participate in an auction for those assets. Ally Financial has planned to be the stalking horse in that auction with an offer of $1.4 billion.",6182012,http://www.reuters.com/article/rescap-bankruptcy/update-1-court-appoints-rescap-examiner-berkshire-raises-bid-idUSL1E8HIBSV20120618

307,BRKa,UPDATE 1-Nationstar named opening bidder for ResCap mortgage unit,"* Nationstar eclipses Berkshire bid for lending unit * Berkshire named opening bidder for loan portfolio * Others bidders can still emerge in bankruptcy process By Rick Rothacker June 19 (Reuters) - A judge on Tuesday approved Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc as the opening bidder for Residential Capital LLC’s mortgage origination and servicing business, beating out an offer from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Berkshire will be the opening bidder for a ResCap loan portfolio, eclipsing an initial offer by ResCap’s parent company, Ally Financial, a ResCap spokeswoman said after a U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing in New York. ResCap, the mortgage unit of Ally Financial, the former in-house financing arm of General Motors Co, filed for bankruptcy last month with a plan to sell assets to Nationstar and Ally for about $4 billion. After Berkshire emerged as a bidder for the mortgage business, Nationstar, a unit of Fortress Investment Group LLC , increased its initial bid by $125 million to $2.45 billion, ResCap said. Berkshire bid $1.44 billion for the loan portfolio, $50 million more than Ally, ResCap said. ResCap spokeswoman Susan Fitzpatrick said the company was encouraged that there was significant interest in the opening bidding for its assets. Other potential buyers will be able to bid as part of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process. ResCap filed for bankruptcy last month as it faced looming bond payments and a possible loss of financing from its parent. Ally is eager to shed mortgage liabilities that have left it limping in the wake of the financial crisis. The auto lender is 74 percent-owned by the U.S. Treasury after a series of government bailouts. Ally spokeswoman Gina Proia said its initial “stalking horse” bid for Rescap’s loan portfolio aimed to generate value for ResCap’s bankruptcy estates as part of a settlement that gave Ally legal releases to claims over mortgage-backed securities. “We are pleased to have fulfilled Ally’s role regarding ResCap’s legacy loan portfolio,” Proia said. Berkshire and Nationstar did not return calls seeking comment. Judge Martin Glenn said on Monday he would appoint an independent examiner to investigate the bankruptcy of ResCap , a move sought by Berkshire. Berkshire has said that some pre-bankruptcy financial transactions between ResCap and Ally were “potentially improper” in calling for the examiner appointment. In a bankruptcy, an examiner investigates allegations such as dishonesty, fraud, incompetence and mismanagement. Judges have previously appointed examiners in bankruptcy cases for Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc and Dynegy Holdings, a unit Dynegy Inc. Fitzpatrick, the ResCap spokeswoman, said the company hopes the examiner’s work can be “completed promptly.”",6192012,http://www.reuters.com/article/rescap-bidding/update-1-nationstar-named-opening-bidder-for-rescap-mortgage-unit-idUSL1E8HJENI20120619

311,BRKa,Former judge to investigate ResCap bankruptcy,"(Reuters) - Arthur Gonzalez, the former chief bankruptcy judge in Manhattan, was named the independent examiner to investigate details of the bankruptcy of home lender Residential Capital LLC, according to a court filing made on Tuesday. Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), which is seeking to buy two of ResCap’s loan businesses, asked the Manhattan Federal bankruptcy court in June to appoint an examiner to look into pre-bankruptcy financial transactions between ResCap and its parent company, Ally Financial GKM.N. Berkshire had said the transactions were “potentially improper” and wanted an examiner to evaluate them. ResCap objected to the examiner proposal, but U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Martin Glenn approved Berkshire’s request at a June hearing. Susan Fitzpatrick, a spokeswoman for ResCap, said by e-mail on Tuesday that ResCap looks forward to working with Gonzalez. A spokeswoman for Ally Financial declined to comment. ResCap filed for bankruptcy in May in Manhattan with a plan to sell two groups of assets for about $4 billion to two separate buyers, Nationstar Mortgage Holdings (NSM.N) and Ally. After Warren Buffett’s Berkshire stepped forward as an interested buyer for both businesses, it replaced Ally as the low bidder, or “stalking horse”, in an auction of the mortgage loans. ResCap’s auctions for the mortgage servicing business and mortgage loan portfolio are due to take place by mid-October. Gonzalez, who is a professor of bankruptcy law at the New York University School of Law, retired as Chief Judge of the Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan in March. He had been a judge in that court since 1995, overseeing some of the largest U.S. bankruptcies including Enron, WorldCom and Chrysler. He held the top spot since 2010. Before becoming a judge, he was a United States Trustee, an employee of the U.S. Justice Department who oversees the bankruptcy process. The judge will set the timeframe, scope and budget for the examination. Bankruptcy examiners have been named in many other bankruptcy cases including Dynegy Holdings, the bankrupt unit of Dynegy Inc., and Lehman Brothers Holdings. These examiner investigations can delay the bankrupt company’s reorganization. For instance, in Dynegy, the company had to renegotiate its plan to get out of bankruptcy with creditors when the examiner found a pre-bankruptcy transfer of assets was improper.

319,BRKa,Analysis: Buffett's ResCap bid gives him bond upside too,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) is bidding on a bankrupt mortgage lender that it may not want, in what some investors and observers view as an effort to make more money on Berkshire’s stake in the company’s bonds. Berkshire has made two bids for Residential Capital, the bankrupt unit of Ally Financial GKM.N that makes loans and collects payments on them. Both bids were topped by Nationstar Mortgage Holdings (NSM.N), which also makes and services loans. An auction for the unit is due to start this fall. ResCap’s parent, Ally Financial, was previously known as General Motors Acceptance Corp and was once the auto lending arm of what is now General Motors Co. (GM.N). ResCap was a major subprime lender that became an albatross for GMAC when losses ballooned during the financial crisis. Ally wants to shed ResCap’s mortgage liabilities as it seeks to repay government bailouts. Many believe Buffett will buy ResCap if it has to, but would rather drive the price higher for Nationstar. For one thing, Berkshire Hathaway lacks the licenses needed to make mortgage loans. For another, Buffett often shies away from acquiring financial companies outside of the insurance business. But Berkshire Hathaway has much to gain from pushing Nationstar to bid more. Berkshire owned more than $900 million of ResCap junior secured debt as of June, representing more than 40 percent of the total outstanding for that class. Going into the bankruptcy, when Nationstar was bidding $2.4 billion, media reports suggested the secured holders could get 93 cents on the dollar. But the more Nationstar pays, the more money Berkshire Hathaway gets. In fact, with the higher offer from Nationstar, secured bondholders are expected to be paid back in full, according to one person involved in the restructuring. Even unsecured creditors are likely to make some recovery, the person said. Berkshire has repeatedly declined comment on its intentions for ResCap, and Buffett’s assistant did not return messages for comment on Thursday and Friday. To outsiders, Buffett’s strategy makes perfect sense. “The worst-case scenario is he owns it and he’ll just hold onto it,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of Destination Wealth Management, an asset manager in California that has more than $12 million in Berkshire Hathaway stock. “The best-case scenario is he extracts a higher bid and that helps him on the debt side,” Yoshikami said. “I think it’s one of his brighter moves.” Buffett still likes a good deal, and he invested in financial companies like Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) when there was money to be made. He is also separately bidding on a loan portfolio that ResCap is selling and is the lead bidder for that asset. But the licensing hurdle is big. In a court filing in June, a banker advising ResCap said one of the advantages of the Nationstar offer was its support from Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB, the government-controlled housing finance providers that own the majority of the loans serviced by ResCap, and that it holds the state licenses needed to run the new assets. Berkshire executive Ted Weschler, in a June court hearing, conceded the company did not have the housing agency support or state licenses lined up, but said, “We’ll do our absolute best to get those approvals.” Many of the court filings have been made by Weschler, an investment manager who joined Berkshire this year to help Buffett run its portfolio. Both Nationstar and ResCap declined to comment. ResCap is now selling the loan portfolio and the servicing business as separate entities, though the sale processes are running at the same time. Bids for both the loans and the servicing platform are due on October 19, and an auction is set for October 23. A bankruptcy court hearing at which the judge would then rule on the sales is set for November 5. Berkshire is the designated initial bidder for the loan unit with an offer of $1.44 billion. The investment fund Lone Star said in June it was also interested in that unit. ResCap filed for bankruptcy in May, with more than $5 billion of liabilities and $15 billion of assets. The case is In re: Residential Capital, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-12020.

320,BRKa,Berkshire Hathaway profit falls on derivative losses,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s ice-cream-to-insurance conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) reported a smaller profit for the second quarter on Friday as losses on derivatives dragged down results, though operating income set the new records Buffett predicted. Buffett eschews derivatives for the most part, but he does have one outstanding - and large - derivative bet tied to stock market performance. While he has said repeatedly he expects that position to be profitable over time, it generated nearly $700 million in losses in the last quarter. Berkshire earned $3.11 billion, or $1,882 per Class A share, compared with a profit of $3.42 billion, or $2,072 per Class A share a year earlier. Book value, Buffett’s preferred measure of Berkshire’s worth, rose to $107,377 per Class A share. The company’s ongoing share buyback is capped at prices no higher than 110 percent of that book value. Berkshire’s cash pile as of the end of the quarter ballooned to $40.66 billion, up more than $3 billion since the year began. Buffett has been itching to make a major acquisition; a deal of more than $20 billion fell through earlier this year, and he has said a deal larger than $30 billion could be possible next year if he does nothing substantial in 2012. One long-term Berkshire investor brushed aside the derivatives hit and said the cash build was the thing to watch in the near term. “Derivatives are less of an issue as investors recognize that the asset is a long-term play, not a short-term strategy. And as Buffet normally does, cash flow is piling up for more beta purchases,” said Michael Yoshikami, CEO of Destination Wealth Management in California, which holds more than $12 million in Berkshire stock. Operating income rose at almost all of Berkshire’s key business lines, with the exception of distribution services company McLane Co. Earlier this year, he predicted the non-insurance businesses would set income records in 2012. Operating income was nearly $1 billion higher in the insurance group, as the reinsurance operations recovered from last year’s massive disaster losses. Within the group, income dropped slightly at auto insurer Geico on higher loss costs for bodily injury and damage to vehicles. Berkshire’s railroad BNSF reported higher revenue and income, as increased volumes for consumer and industrial products transported offset sharp declines in volume for both coal and agricultural products. McLane’s income fell, Berkshire said, because the year-ago quarter benefited from manufacturer price increases on a number of products. That benefit was absent in the most recent quarter. The results also bear out comments Buffett made in mid-July that housing had started to show signs of a rebound, albeit off a very low base. Berkshire’s housing-related businesses picked up in the quarter, led by double-digit revenue increases at the manufactured home builder Clayton Homes. Another Berkshire investor said the results confirm the long-term shift in the company away from its reliance on the insurance business to make money, a shift that was accelerated with the BNSF acquisition. “The non-insurance side is the driver ... the core of this conglomerate now is on the non-insurance side,” said David Rolfe, chief investment officer of Wedgewood Partners. “When expectations are so low and muted, this is fantastic.” ",8032012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshirehathaway-results/berkshire-hathaway-profit-falls-on-derivative-losses-idUSBRE8721LQ20120803

Berkshire Hathaway on Tuesday reporting holding 18.7 million shares of BNY Mellon as of June 30, according to U.S. regulatory filings. That’s up from 5.6 million shares at the end of March and 1.8 million at the end of 2011, filings show. BNY Mellon shares closed Tuesday at $22.15, down 48 percent since in mid-August 2007 before the financial crisis. Meanwhile, the S&P; 500 index is down only 3.4 percent during that same period. Some of the custody bank’s operations have struggled in a subdued earnings environment, hurt by declines in global market activity and ultra-low interest rates. BNY Mellon’s foreign exchange business, the subject of federal investigations and lawsuits filed by several pension funds, has also experienced a significant decline in revenue. But despite depressed stock market activity, BNY Mellon’s assets under custody and administration continue to grow at a steady clip. In the second quarter, for example, the bank said those assets rose about 2 percent to $27.1 trillion, reflecting net new business. Credit-rating firm DBRS said BNY Mellon was the only trust bank to show growth in custody assets during the second quarter.

The deal is subject to U.S. regulatory approval, Clal, a subsidiary of the IDB Holding IDBH.TA group, said in a statement on Sunday. If approvals are not obtained by December 15 each side will be eligible to extend the deadline by three months. Clal U.S. Holdings owns U.S. insurer Guard Financial Group, which it bought five years ago for $120 million. Clal Insurance said it would record a loss of 13 million shekels ($3.2 million) in the second quarter to cover costs associated with the sale.

326,BRKa,Buffett cuts $16 billion municipal credit bet in half,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc will terminate $8.25 billion in credit default swap protection it has sold on municipal debt, more than half of a total $16 billion in protection it has sold on bonds of states, cities and towns, the company said in a regulatory filing this month. The move comes as many investors, including Berkshire Chairman billionaire investor Warren Buffett, foresee an uptick in U.S. municipal bankruptcies. Buffett said last month that the bankruptcies of three California cities in as many weeks was making traditionally objectionable Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy filings more palatable to local governments in financial crises. Berkshire sells protection against the default of states, towns and cities using credit default swaps. In these contracts the company would be required to reimburse its counterparty for debt losses in the event of a municipal bankruptcy. Berkshire said in its filing that it reached an agreement with a counterparty to terminate $8.25 billion of the CDS portfolio, which references more than 500 state and municipal debt issuers. It did not name the counterparty to the trades. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the trade termination. Analysts at Citigroup said in a report that the disclosure likely represents the termination of contracts that Berkshire held with the estate of Lehman Brothers, which failed in 2008. Lehman bought $8.25 billion in CDS protection on bonds from 14 states from Berkshire subsidiary BH Finance LLC in 2007, before the bank failed, Citigroup said. Lehman’s estate has been trying to close out the trade since February 2009, but has struggled to do so because of the trade’s large size and relatively low liquidity volumes in the municipal CDS market, Citigroup said. The contracts had gained in value to Lehman’s favor at the time of its bankruptcy, Citigroup added. After Berkshire’s disclosure, “it seems that finally it has succeeded, unwinding it directly with Berkshire Hathaway,” Citigroup said. Representatives of Berkshire and Lehman did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Berkshire also reduced its exposure to CDS backed by high yield corporate debt in the first half of the year, to $3.26 billion, from $4.57 billion at the end of 2011, it said in the filing.

331,BRKa,Column: Warren Buffett's municipal weapons of mass destruction,"(The views expressed are the author’s own and not those of Reuters.) A lot of ink has been spilled recently over Berkshire Hathaway’s move to close out $8 billion worth of municipal credit default swaps. Journalists and market commentators have wondered whether Warren Buffett has soured on municipal bonds as an investment vehicle and whether other investors should as well. The latest bit of speculation comes from Charles Gasparino, who writes that the move was most likely political and had to do with disagreements with President Obama over the politics of welfare. Gasparino’s piece in the New York Post may be the most convoluted thing that I’ve ever read about municipal bonds: “And even if, when you dig deeper, the move suggests Buffett wasn’t making a bet against all munis but only those that adopt some of the same policies he and President Obama are advocating on a national level.” Gasparino says that after making calls to market participants, he has determined that some of the municipal credit default swaps that Buffett closed out were written on the debt of California and Illinois, two states in dire fiscal shape. It’s true that California and Illinois are cash-strapped and facing tough fiscal decisions. But the more important issue is that both states have constitutional requirements that prioritize bondholders. These constitutional provisions render credit default swaps on these states useless because, unless the whole economy collapses, these bonds will be paid. States are also not allowed to go bankrupt under federal law. So muni CDS are not insurance against states defaulting but are speculative securities that allow an investor to book gains and losses. Buffett’s public pronouncement that derivatives like credit default swaps are “weapons of mass destruction” has not stopped Berkshire from investing in, and getting burned by, such securities on occasion. The place to see Buffett’s view of municipal bonds is Berkshire Hathaway’s investment holdings, and it looks as if nothing has changed much recently. Berkshire reports its municipal bond holdings in the “Investments in fixed maturity securities” section of its 10Q SEC filing. At the end of 2011, Berkshire owned just over $3 billion worth of muni bonds, but according to a filing dated June 30, 2012, the Berkshire portfolio had dipped slightly to $2.9 billion, a decline of about 4 percent. Given how low municipal bond yields have gone, I’m surprised it’s not a bigger decline. An insurance firm like Berkshire gets no benefit from the municipal bond tax exemption, so it’s not an asset class that can provide the firm with that much investment income. If Buffett were totally sour on muniland, he would likely exit all his cash bond holdings and move to U.S. Treasury bonds. Buffett is a very smart investor, but it’s important to look at his decisions from many angles, not just one that fits a political narrative. (The fifth paragraph of this column has been corrected to say figures are in billions of dollars, not millions of dollars) ",8282012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-column-warren-buffett/column-warren-buffetts-municipal-weapons-of-mass-destruction-idUSBRE87R0LW20120828

338,BRKa,"UPDATE 2-Nationstar, Ocwen and Walter fight over ResCap-sources","* Auction next week for mortgage business, loans * Nationstar is opening bidder for mortgage business * Berkshire bidding for loan portfolio By Jessica Toonkel and Rick Rothacker Oct 19 (Reuters) - Ocwen Financial Corp and Walter Investment Management Corp have teamed up to top Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc’s starting bid for Residential Capital LLC’s mortgage business, ensuring a bankruptcy auction goes ahead next week, two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday. The consortium offered to buy the mortgage business for $40 million more than Nationstar’s $2.45 billion opening bid, one source said. Nationstar was expected to make an updated bid, another source said. Several other potential buyers that had shown interest in the business, including private equity firm Blackstone Group  and technology company IBM Corp, were not expected to submit offers, one of the sources said, potentially leaving Nationstar and the Ocwen-Walter group as the main contenders. ResCap, the mortgage unit of auto lender Ally Financial Inc, filed for bankruptcy in May in an effort to wipe out legal liabilities from mortgage-backed securities it sold during the housing boom. Ally, which is 74 percent owned by the U.S. government after a series of bailouts, is looking to focus on U.S. auto lending and banking after taking huge losses on ResCap’s mortgages. It is also selling international businesses to help pay back taxpayers. Residential Capital and Ocwen declined to comment. Spokespeople for Nationstar, Walter, Blackstone and IBM could not be immediately reached. Bids were due by the end of business on Friday for ResCap’s mortgage platform, as well as a portfolio of loans. The private auction begins on Tuesday at a New York hotel. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc has set the low bid for the loan package at $1.44 billion, topping Ally, which had said it would buy the loans if no one else did. Berkshire also argued in bankruptcy court for the right to be the opening bidder for the mortgage business, but failed to unseat Nationstar. It did get Nationstar, majority owned by Fortress Investment Group LLC, to increase the opening bid by $125 million. It was not clear whether Berkshire planned to submit another bid. Two other sources familiar with the auction, but not close to Buffett said they did not expect Berkshire to enter the fray for the mortgage business. Berkshire “does not normally discuss our activities other than when we’re legally required to do so,” said Buffett’s assistant, Debbie Bosanek. The ResCap sale is expected to raise at least $4 billion, which will then become part of a pool of money used to pay back Ally and other investors, including those who bought mortgage-backed securities tied to ResCap home loans that went bad. Nationstar, Ocwen and Walter have been building up their mortgage servicing businesses by buying assets shed by larger banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley  and Bank of America Corp. Ocwen also agreed this month to buy Homeward Residential Holdings from private-equity firm WL Ross & Co LLC for $750 million in cash and stock.",10192012,http://www.reuters.com/article/rescap-auction/update-2-nationstar-ocwen-and-walter-fight-over-rescap-sources-idUSL1E8LJAWD20121019

Other possible buyers had previously expressed interest in ResCap’s mortgage servicing and lending business, including Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Reuters reported on Friday that Nationstar and the Ocwen were bidding for the mortgage business and that they were emerging as the leading contenders. Nationstar’s $2.45 billion offer was the opening bid in the auction. But the Ocwen-Walter consortium last week bid about $40 million more to move the process forward to Tuesday’s auction, another source told Reuters. The bidding process started at 10 a.m. at a New York hotel. Nationstar’s shares closed up 1.5 percent to $34.86 on Tuesday. Ocwen’s fell 1.7 percent to $36.20, while Walter’s were down 2.1 percent to $40.69. ResCap and Nationstar declined to comment. Ocwen and Walter could not be immediately reached.

It did get Nationstar, majority owned by Fortress Investment Group LLC, to increase the opening bid by $125 million. Nationstar and Ocwen are growing non-bank mortgage servicers that have been buying operations shed by larger banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp. Mortgage servicers collect payments from borrowers and help modify loans when borrowers fall behind. Banks are pulling back from the business because operating costs have soared since the housing bubble burst. New capital rules have also made it less favorable for banks to hold onto mortgage servicing assets. Ally, which is 74 percent owned by the U.S. government after a series of bailouts, is looking to focus on U.S. auto lending and banking after taking huge losses on ResCap’s mortgages. The former lending arm of General Motors Co on Tuesday agreed to sell its Canadian operations to Royal Bank of Canada as it sells international businesses to speed up repayment to taxpayers.

Yet despite the weakness, Buffett said he was “salivating” to make another major acquisition, adding that two deals of around $20 billion each had fallen through this year. In an interview on CNBC, Buffett said the rate of decline was larger in Asia than in Europe, although the Asian economies are declining off a higher base. At the same time, he said Berkshire’s U.S. housing-related businesses were growing at double-digit percentage rates of late. Buffett has maintained that the economy will not truly start to turn around until the housing market improves, and he said Wednesday that housing had clearly started to turn. Berkshire is heavily exposed to housing construction, as it owns a brick maker, a carpet maker, a realtor and the largest builder of manufactured homes. Yet even with growth from its existing portfolio companies, Berkshire is always on the hunt to expand by acquisition. Buffett told CNBC: “I’m salivating” to spend some of Berkshire’s $40 billion cash pile on a deal. At Berkshire’s annual meeting in May, he said a $20 billion deal had recently fallen through, and on Wednesday he acknowledged a second one had come apart as well. He did not give any indication as to what kinds of companies were involved. In a wide-ranging interview from an event in Ohio, Buffett also said the best thing for the economy would be for U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to stay on for a third term. With the presidential race running neck-and-neck, there has been speculation of late that Republican candidate Mitt Romney, if elected, would seek a new Fed chairman when Bernanke’s term expires in 2014. Buffett disagreed with the idea. “I would vote for Bernanke again, and I’d get my kids out and everybody else to vote for him,” he said.

Buffett told CNBC: “I’m salivating” to spend some of Berkshire’s $40 billion cash pile on a deal. At Berkshire’s annual meeting in May, he said a $20 billion deal had recently fallen through, and on Wednesday he acknowledged a second one had come apart as well. He did not give any indication as to what kinds of companies were involved. In a wide-ranging interview from an event in Ohio, Buffett also said the best thing for the economy would be for U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to stay on for a third term. With the presidential race running neck-and-neck, there has been speculation of late that Republican candidate Mitt Romney, if elected, would seek a new Fed chairman when Bernanke’s term expires in 2014. Buffett disagreed with the idea. “I would vote for Bernanke again, and I’d get my kids out and everybody else to vote for him,” he said.",10242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-buffett/update-1-buffett-says-global-economy-slowing-wants-more-deals-idUSL1E8LO1EW20121024

Berkshire earned $3.92 billion, or $2,373 per Class A share, compared with $2.28 billion, or $1,380 per share, a year earlier. Book value, Buffett’s preferred measure of the company’s worth, rose to $111,718 per Class A share, up 11.9 percent since year end. The ice-cream-to-insurance conglomerate, which employs more than a quarter-million people worldwide, reported its cash pile grew to $47.78 billion, up $10 billion from the start of the year. Buffett told CNBC last week that he was “salivating” for a major acquisition after two deals of more than $20 billion each fell through in the last few months. Buffett knocked off a bit of that cash on Friday with a deal to buy toy and party supply company Oriental Trading Co, though at $500 million it has little chance of “moving the needle,” as Buffett has said he would like to do.

Meanwhile, the utilities business was able to charge higher prices, and a real estate brokerage housed within the energy business grew by acquisition, adding to results.

352,BRKa,Warren Buffett buys toy and party-supplies company,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) said it would buy Oriental Trading Co, a toy and party supplies company that is partially owned by private equity firm KKR & Co LP (KKR.N), for an undisclosed sum. The deal ends a period of instability for the Omaha, Nebraska-based maker of merchandise ranging from pink flamingos and wedding favors to Halloween decorations and beading supplies, in which it underwent bankruptcy and was passed around by private equity firms. Berkshire will pay around $500 million for the company after an earlier auction did not yield satisfactory bids, according to two people close to the deal. In mid-October, Oriental Trading Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Steve Mendlik e-mailed Berkshire Hathaway Chief Financial Officer Marc Hamburg, who Mendlik had met previously, CEO Sam Taylor told Reuters in an interview. Two hours later, Mendlik got a phone call from Buffett. The two spoke for around 10 minutes before Buffett said he was interested in taking a look at the company and wanted to see its financials. Just a few days later, Taylor and other members of Oriental Trading management met with Buffett for about two hours. The company then offered itself for sale at a price Buffett accepted. “He was very warm and down to earth,” Taylor said. “It was a surreal experience. I was sitting on the couch pinching myself saying ‘I can’t believe I’m talking to Warren Buffett.’” Oriental Trading’s strong cash flow, customer loyalty and high core profit margins made the business attractive to Buffett, Taylor said. Not to mention the fact that Buffett, who hails from Omaha, is a fan of his hometown, Taylor said. Oriental Trading, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 2010, is owned by more than a dozen financial institutions, including KKR. “Over the past two years the company has transitioned to steady growth, both top and bottom line, and there is no question the company has a bright future as part of the Berkshire Hathaway enterprise,” Jeremiah Lane, a director in KKR’s special situations team, said in a statement. In 2006, Carlyle Group LP (CG.O) purchased most of Oriental Trading for more than $1 billion from private equity firm Brentwood Associates. Saddled with debt, the company filed for bankruptcy in August 2010, allowing creditors to take over. Although the company’s earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) only fell by a third from peak to trough because of higher bulk mail costs and the recession, that was enough to cripple it due to its high debt load, one of the people said. Carlyle had leveraged the company at 7.5 times its EBITDA, resulting in it breaching debt covenants and eventually going through a debt restructuring. KKR, which bought a third of the company’s $400 million bank debt and got 55 cents on the dollar during the restructuring, stands to make two times its money due to Buffett’s acquisition, the person added. A year and a half after Oriental Trading emerged from bankruptcy, investors were looking for an exit. Reuters reported in August that Oriental Trading was up for sale in a deal that could fetch about $500 million. “For us and our employees this is huge,” Taylor said. “It’s a permanent home for Oriental Trading so we can get off the private equity treadmill and not have to deal with uncertainty about who is going to be the owner.” The deal is expected to close by the end of November. Oriental Trading was advised by Lazard Middle Market. Founded in 1932, Oriental Trading sells more than 40,000 products, ranging from Halloween decorations to teaching supplies and novelty toys. Oriental Trading is one of several recent deals for party and crafts-supply companies. Party City Holdings Inc was purchased by private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners in June for $2.69 billion.

The diversified services company, which struck a deal on Monday to acquire investment bank Jefferies Group Inc (JEF.N) for $3.6 billion [ID:nL1E8MC4I6], models itself in more than cosmetic ways on Warren Buffett’s empire. There is the spare corporate website, which bears a striking resemblance to Berkshire’s similarly plain home page, plus the annual letters from Chairman Ian Cumming and President Joseph Steinberg, which read so much like Buffett’s February missives that any reader could be forgiven for confusing the two. Leucadia, whose holdings range from real estate to mining, even has a joint venture with Berkshire - a commercial mortgage business called Berkadia that is one of the largest in the country. No wonder, then, that the company, although not widely known, is sometimes called “baby Berkshire.” “Overall, Berkadia has made excellent money for us, and Joe and Ian have been terrific partners,” Buffett wrote in his 2003 investor letter. In their latest annual letter, Steinberg and Cumming noted that Jefferies caused Leucadia huge losses in 2011, as the stock plunged in the wake of MF Global’s collapse. Leucadia already owns about 29 percent of Jefferies. They had nothing but the highest praise, though, for the way the bank’s management reacted - in textbook Buffett style, and in keeping with their long-stated admiration for Jefferies boss (and now Leucadia CEO) Richard Handler. “We are proud of our ownership and association with Jefferies and believe their response was their ﬁnest hour. Jefferies enjoys a great deal of good will in its middle market and we are grateful to its clients and customers who stood by them,” Cumming and Steinberg wrote. New York-based Leucadia operates in beef processing, wood and plastics manufacturing, casino gaming, real estate, medical product development - even wine, among its many other interests. (In fact, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission still categorizes it as a lumber and wood products company). In 1978, fellow Harvard graduates Cumming and Steinberg took over a struggling financial services company known as Talcott National Corp and ultimately changed its name to Leucadia. They remain the largest shareholders, together holding more than 18 percent of the stock. (In their 2007 annual report, the pair confessed the name was simply picked off a California road sign, as they liked the sound of it and thought it had a good chance of not already being taken in New York). They immediately pursued a strategy familiar to anyone who knows anything about the “Oracle of Omaha”: Buy attractive assets cheaply and run them better than the last guy. Leucadia’s fifth-largest shareholder, Horizon Kinetics LLC, placed the company’s success squarely on the two men’s shoulders in a quarterly report last month. “We believe Leucadia is a well diversified, well capitalized, profitable company with the same management in place that created this history,” Horizon managers wrote, noting that as a bonus, the stock traded for less than book value. “A low valuation is one of the better predictive attributes and is particularly compelling when combined, as in the case of Leucadia National, with proven owner-operators.” A 2005 Kiplinger’s profile of the two headlined “Better Than Buffett” - one of the rare articles to focus on the publicity-shy managers - noted that from 1978 through 2004, Leucadia’s returns were actually 6 percentage points better than Berkshire’s Class A shares. Since then, however, the tables have turned dramatically. Berkshire is up more than 45 percent since the start of 2005, while Leucadia is down just over 10 percent. Over that period, Berkshire has been boosted by major acquisitions like the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad and the chemicals company Lubrizol, while Leucadia made difficult forays into the telecommunications market and took substantial lumps during the financial crisis. Despite the divergent stock prices of late, the casual observer could still be forgiven for comparing Cumming and Steinberg to Buffett and his vice chairman, Charlie Munger - savvy businessmen who figured out early that two heads can be better than one. Like those men, they found much of their fortune in insurance. Through the 1990s, Leucadia was primarily a multiline insurer offering both property and life coverage. The insurance business was more than 80 percent of Leucadia’s revenue, in fact. Even then, though, it had tentacles in automotive lending and the manufacturing of do-it-yourself home improvement products, among other pursuits. By 2000, it had added wine production, real estate and the mining of precious metals to its stable. Before long, insurance was gone and what was left was a Berkshire-esque conglomerate that still had a large hand in high finance but also dabbled in virtually any other sector with attractive but cheap assets. In the last investor letter, the two men struck a cautious tone, especially given the unsettled economy and the partisan rancor in Washington over the national debt. But in true Buffett-like fashion, they promised to keep growing anyway. “We are enthusiastic about the future of our broad array of operating businesses and investments and have our eyes open for additional acquisitions.

359,BRKa,"Buffett's Berkshire sheds consumer stocks, buys industrials in third quarter","(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway sold retailers and consumer heavyweight stocks in the third quarter but took new positions in industrial manufacturers like Deere & Co and Precision Castparts, according to a regulatory filing on Wednesday. Many of the investment decision were made not by Buffett himself but by his two investment managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs. Buffett has said only the changes in Berkshire’s biggest positions, like adding to holdings of Wells Fargo, were made by him. The portfolio was again volatile this quarter, with a number of large moves in a wide variety of stocks. While Buffett is the exemplar of buy-and-hold investing, he has indicated that at least one of the team of Weschler and Combs is inclined to trade more actively from quarter to quarter.

Many of the investment decision were made not by Buffett himself but by his two investment managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs. Buffett has said only the changes in Berkshire’s biggest positions, like adding to holdings of Wells Fargo , were made by him. The portfolio was again volatile this quarter, with a number of large moves in a wide variety of stocks. While Buffett is the exemplar of buy-and-hold investing, he has indicated that at least one of the team of Weschler and Combs is inclined to trade more actively from quarter to quarter.

361,BRKa,Warren Buffett's Berkshire shutters Virginia newspaper,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway plans to shutter the 143-year-old News & Messenger in Manassas, Virginia, just six months after it was scooped up from Media General. The 10,000 circulation newspaper, its website, and its companion weekly publication will close on December 30, the day the final print edition will be published. The move affects the staff of 33 whose jobs will be eliminated. The announcement was made on Wednesday by World Media Enterprise, which operates the 63 newspapers that Berkshire Hathaway acquired from Media General in June. “Business conditions drove us to this decision,” wrote Doug Hiemstra, president of World Media Enterprises, in a post published on the News & Messenger’s website Insidenova.com. “We do not see a long-term viable way to maintain a daily news operation here.” Buffett, who not too long ago derided newspapers as investments, changed course this year, snapping up scores of small and mid-sized papers throughout the United States. In addition to the majority of Media General’s newspaper properties, he recently purchased a paper in Texas and took a small stake in the newspaper chain Lee Enterprises. Known as the “Oracle of Omaha,” Buffett’s acquisition approach to newspapers is to buy small publications that cover the local market. Though he holds a stake in the Washington Post Co, he shuns large metropolitan newspapers. The closing of such a small paper in the Berkshire stable could be a sign that even publications that are laser-focused on community news are facing serious challenges. Indeed, Buffett said in a CNBC interview in October that revenue is down about 1 percent at Berkshire’s smaller papers. “Let me be clear: World Media remains bullish on community newspapers and our ability to publish news and advertising content on a variety of platforms that is useful to our readers and the communities in which they live,” Hiemstra wrote on the News & Messenger’s website.

Berkshire will pay Caixabank’s insurance unit VidaCaixa a fee of 600 million euros ($779 million) and the Spanish bank will book 524 million euros in capital gains for the deal, the lender said. U.S.-based Berkshire Hathaway maintains an active business reinsuring life and health risks internationally through its subsidiary General Re, which accounts for about 15 percent of the conglomerate’s total insurance premiums. The business has been profitable this year, though much less so than Berkshire’s bread-and-butter activities of reinsuring property risk. In its most recent quarterly report, the company blamed the shortfall on its Australian contracts, while noting results in Europe had been strong. Because of Berkshire’s appetite for risk, it is not uncommon for companies to shed insurance risk to Buffett’s conglomerate.

370,BRKa,Berkshire buyback seen clashing with estate tax push,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s $1.2 billion share buyback from a single unnamed investor likely helped that person’s estate save substantially on taxes, just one day after the Berkshire Hathaway CEO said the rich should actually be paying more, not less, when they die. With the “fiscal cliff” looming and estate taxes set to rise dramatically in less than three weeks, the timing was seen as advantageous - and, according to Berkshire watchers, also out of place in the context of Buffett’s recent tax activism. “I would say ‘Warren, would you please just keep your nose out of this.’ He’s not in a position to criticize what’s good for America and for everyone else’s estate,” said Anthony Sabino, a professor of business at St. John’s University. “He’s no doubt utilized the present tax code to maximum effect.” Berkshire said it bought 9,200 Class A shares from “the estate of a long-time shareholder,” whom it did not name, at $131,000 per share, a price in line with where Berkshire has traded in recent weeks. Buffett’s assistant didn’t respond to a request for comment on the shareholder’s identity. The shares represent 1 percent of Berkshire’s Class A stock. The repurchase came less than a month ahead of the looming “fiscal cliff,” automatic tax hikes and spending cuts set for January 1 that the White House and members of Congress have been negotiating to avoid. Among other levies, the estate tax is expected to rise in the new year package by as much as 20 percentage points, which may have spurred the anonymous shareholder to sell now. Buffett was a signatory of an open letter released Tuesday that called for a lower starting point for the tax and a higher taxation rate, beginning at 45 percent. “We believe it is right to have a significant tax on large estates when they are passed on to the next generation. We believe it is right morally and economically, and that an estate tax promotes democracy by slowing the concentration of wealth and power,” the 33 signers wrote in the letter released by the campaign, United for a Fair Economy. He has also been publicly campaigning for more than a year for higher taxes on the wealthy, even lending his name to a proposal called the “Buffett Rule” that failed in Congress. Berkshire also said Wednesday it raised the threshold for future share buybacks to 120 percent of book value from 110 percent, the level it chose when it first approved a repurchase program in September 2011. The higher level allowed Berkshire to complete this latest buyback, which was above the old threshold. After news of the buyback, Berkshire’s shares were up 3.1 percent at $134,850. Based on the company’s book value at the end of the third quarter, the buyback limit would stand for now at $134,061.60. The stock has traded below that level for most of this quarter. Buffett was always loath to offer share buybacks and consented to it last year only after Berkshire hit historically low valuations. In its most recent quarterly filing, Berkshire said it had not made any repurchases in the first nine months of 2012, after spending just $67.5 million on buybacks in 2011. “I don’t expect a significant repurchase program to be announced as (Buffett) is clear that he is in acquisition mode,” said Michael Yoshikami, founder and CEO of Destination Wealth Management and a long-time Berkshire investor. Berkshire ended the third quarter with $47.78 billion in cash, and Buffett has made no secret of his desire for a purchase in the $20 billion to $30 billion range. Yet given his wealth and his own self-professed low tax rate, Buffett has been called out in some quarters for not practicing what he preaches. “I have a problem with Warren, who’s basically done with this (issue), to say ‘yeah, raise the estate tax,’” Sabino said. “I think, again, with all due respect for his sagacity at selling stocks, he’s being incredibly short-sighted.” ",12122012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-buyback/berkshire-buyback-seen-clashing-with-estate-tax-push-idUSBRE8BB0ZV20121212

374,BRKa,Berkshire buyback seen clashing with estate tax push,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s $1.2 billion share buyback from a single unnamed investor likely helped that person’s estate save substantially on taxes, just one day after the Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) CEO said the rich should actually be paying more, not less, when they die. With the “fiscal cliff” looming and taxes set to rise dramatically in less than three weeks, the timing was seen as advantageous - and, according to Berkshire watchers, also out of place in the context of Buffett’s recent tax activism. “I would say ‘Warren, would you please just keep your nose out of this.’ He’s not in a position to criticize what’s good for America and for everyone else’s estate,” said Anthony Sabino, a professor of business at St. John’s University. “He’s no doubt utilized the present tax code to maximum effect.” Berkshire said it bought 9,200 Class A shares from “the estate of a long-time shareholder,” whom it did not name, at $131,000 per share, a price in line with where Berkshire has traded in recent weeks. Buffett’s assistant didn’t respond to a request for comment on the shareholder’s identity. The shares represent 1 percent of Berkshire’s Class A stock. The repurchase came less than a month ahead of the looming “fiscal cliff,” automatic tax hikes and spending cuts set for January 1 that the White House and members of Congress have been negotiating to avoid. Among other levies, the estate tax is expected to rise in the new year package by as much as 20 percentage points, and capital gains taxes will also rise, which may have spurred the anonymous shareholder to sell now. Buffett was a signatory of an open letter released Tuesday that called for a lower starting point for the estate tax and a higher taxation rate, beginning at 45 percent. “We believe it is right to have a significant tax on large estates when they are passed on to the next generation. We believe it is right morally and economically, and that an estate tax promotes democracy by slowing the concentration of wealth and power,” the 33 signers wrote in the letter released by the campaign, United for a Fair Economy. He has also been publicly campaigning for more than a year for higher taxes on the wealthy, even lending his name to a proposal called the “Buffett Rule” that failed in Congress. Berkshire also said Wednesday it raised the threshold for future share buybacks to 120 percent of book value from 110 percent, the level it chose when it first approved a repurchase program in September 2011. The higher level allowed Berkshire to complete this latest buyback, which was above the old threshold. After news of the buyback, Berkshire’s shares were up 3.1 percent at $134,850. Based on the company’s book value at the end of the third quarter, the buyback limit would stand for now at $134,061.60. The stock has traded below that level for most of this quarter. Buffett was always loath to offer share buybacks and consented to it last year only after Berkshire hit historically low valuations. In its most recent quarterly filing, Berkshire said it had not made any repurchases in the first nine months of 2012, after spending just $67.5 million on buybacks in 2011. “I don’t expect a significant repurchase program to be announced as (Buffett) is clear that he is in acquisition mode,” said Michael Yoshikami, founder and CEO of Destination Wealth Management and a long-time Berkshire investor. Berkshire ended the third quarter with $47.78 billion in cash, and Buffett has made no secret of his desire for a purchase in the $20 billion to $30 billion range. Yet given his wealth and his own self-professed low tax rate, Buffett has been called out in some quarters for not practicing what he preaches. “I have a problem with Warren, who’s basically done with this (issue), to say ‘yeah, raise the estate tax,’” Sabino said. “I think, again, with all due respect for his sagacity at selling stocks, he’s being incredibly short-sighted.” (The story corrects extraneous reference to “estate taxes” in 2nd paragraph and clarifies tax references in 7th and 8th paragraphs) ",12132012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-buyback/berkshire-buyback-seen-clashing-with-estate-tax-push-idUSBRE8BC1EY20121213

In 2011, Buffett said Sokol violated the company’s insider trading rules to score a $3 million windfall profit on shares of U.S. chemicals maker Lubrizol, which rose by nearly a third after Berkshire Hathaway announced it would buy the company. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began investigating Sokol’s investment in Lubrizol shortly after Sokol resigned from Berkshire Hathaway. Sokol’s lawyer Barry Wm. Levine told Reuters late on Thursday that he was informed that the SEC had wrapped up its probe and decided not to take action against Sokol. “SEC has terminated its investigation and has concluded not to bring any proceedings against Sokol,” said Levine, a lawyer at legal firm Dickstein Shapiro. Sokol has been “completely cleared” as there was no evidence against his client, Levine said. Berkshire Hathaway and SEC could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters outside of regular U.S. business hours. Buffett surprised many when he said Sokol had violated insider trading rules by failing to disclose his purchase of Lubrizol shares, less than four weeks after starting talks with Citigroup Inc bankers on acquiring all the shares in the chemicals company that Berkshire Hathaway did not already own. Sokol, who once chaired Berkshire Hathaway’s MidAmerican Energy unit, ran its NetJets plane leasing unit, and was a top Warren Buffett deal maker. He was considered a leading contender to succeed Buffett as Berkshire Hathaway’s chief executive. Buffett told investors last year that Berkshire Hathaway’s board has identified his successor, easing some shareholder concern about the future of the company once the famed investor steps down as chief executive.

385,BRKa,Warren Buffett made late-2012 bid for NYSE Euronext - sources,"* Berkshire is ‘Company A’ in ICE filing - sources * Berkshire bid was less than ICE’s offer - sources Jan 28 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett made a bid to acquire New York Stock Exchange operator NYSE Euronext last November, but his offer was less than one already on the table from IntercontinentalExchange Inc, two people familiar with the matter said. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway was the “Company A” bidder disclosed in a regulatory filing by ICE on Monday. Buffett’s assistant could not immediately comment on the report. NYSE Euronext declined to comment. The news was first reported by CNBC’s David Faber. ICE agreed to buy NYSE Euronext late last month for $8.2 billion following about two months of talks. Before the deal closed, NYSE’s board of directors instructed the company’s bankers to pursue alternatives, according to the ICE filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Bankers from Perella Weinberg approached “Company A” on Nov. 25, the filing said. On Nov. 28, “Company A” presented an offer that was less than the ICE bid and was conditioned on the sale of NYSE Euronext’s European derivatives business for a minimum price. At a NYSE board meeting Dec. 12 and 13, Perella Weinberg indicated that it was still working with “Company A” but that the bidder had not improved the offer. There was no further mention of the unnamed bidder in the filing. Had Berkshire done the deal, it would have been somewhat small by Buffett’s standards. He spent much of 2012 trying to do deals in the $20 billion range, and even said at one point that he might have to look at doing a $30 billion deal this year.",1282013,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-nyse/warren-buffett-made-late-2012-bid-for-nyse-euronext-sources-idUSL1N0AX6SA20130128
386,BRKa,Berkshire Hathaway taps investment-grade market for $2.6bn,"NEW YORK, Jan 29 (IFR) - Warren Buffett made a well-calculated move into the US corporate bond market on Tuesday, issuing $2.6 billion of bonds before a possible spike in Treasury yields later this week. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, rated Aa2/AA+, sold $300 million of three-year notes, $800 million of five-year notes, $500 million of 10-year securities and $1 billion of 30-year bonds. The proceeds will be used to pay off $1.2 billion of floating-rate notes and $1.4 billion of 2.125% notes that mature on February 11, 2013. The deal came after a roughly 20 basis point (bp) rise in the US 10-year Treasury yield in recent days as the outlook for the eurozone and the US economy improved. “Buffett is very savvy, in the sense that he seems to have timed this issue before we have non-farm payrolls,” said one banker not involved in the deal. “We’ve seen rates on the 10-year Treasury back up about 20bp in the last few days and if we see another 20bp rise on the back of good numbers it will definitely impact demand,” he said. Many credit strategists and asset managers have warned investors to be wary of buying any corporate bond rated single A or higher, because they are the most at risk of suffering negative returns if Treasury rates rise. That rate increase appears to have begun, with the 10-year Treasury increasing from 1.8% on January 16 to 1.996% today, and a high of 2.005% on Monday. So far that has not been enough to impact demand for high-grade corporate bonds, but some fear the Treasury yield could jump another 20bp if January’s payroll data released on Friday are strong. Already higher-rated corporates have seen less demand for their new bond issues this year, at least compared with those in the triple-B category. That’s because their very tight credit spreads offer little in the way of a cushion against a back-up in Treasury yields. The Berkshire Hathaway name, however, carries so much cache among the investor community, that it attracted $8 billion of demand. “Frankly it’s the Buffett effect,” said one bond syndicate manager not involved in the deal. “Berkshire Hathaway is a very good name and although it is rated double-A, this type of name attracts strong private banking demand,” the syndicate manager said, referring to private wealth asset managers. There has not been a lot of double-A issuance this year so far. Of the $95 billion issued in January, about 63% has been from financial names, making issuance from a solid industrial like Berkshire Hathaway all the more attractive. The spreads at which the deal was launched were also attractive versus the trading levels of comparables such as Merck & Co or 3M Co, said one banker. The three-year notes were priced at 37.5bp over comparable Treasuries, the five year at 70bp, the 10-year at 110bp and the 30-year at 140bp. One syndicate manager said Merck could do a new 10-year at around 70bp over Treasuries.

391,BRKa,Cigna and Berkshire sign $2.2 billion reinsurance deal,"(Reuters) - Cigna Inc.(CI.N) and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) struck a $2.2 billion deal in which Berkshire will reinsure Cigna’s risk related to future claims for two annuity businesses Cigna has exited. The move will reduce risk for Cigna by eliminating the possibility of a capital call as well as volatility, it said, adding that it had exposure for up to $4 billion in future claims. Cigna sells health care insurance and disability, life and accident insurance. It was a reinsurer for the two closed annuity businesses, collecting a premium in return for assuming the risk of the difference between the minimum benefit and the portfolio value. There have been no new policies written since 2000 and the business has been in run-off since then. Some of the top producers of variable annuities have either exited the business or said they would scale back sales, given the risks involved. In a persistently low interest rate environment like the one life insurers have faced in the last few years, the guaranteed benefits on some kinds of variable annuities become harder to guarantee. Berkshire will receive $1.8 billion in assets related to the businesses and another $400 million, including $100 million in cash and $300 million funded from a tax benefit Cigna will receive. The assets, which according to Fitch Ratings include both public and private bonds as well as commercial mortgages, support the guaranteed minimum death benefit annuities and guaranteed minimum income annuities. Fitch said there were no changes to its credit ratings for Cigna because of the deal. Cigna said it will take an after-tax charge of $500 million in its first-quarter earnings to cover the gap between the payment to Berkshire and its recorded reserves. It is to report fourth-quarter results on February 7. While it affects Cigna’s net earnings, the company said the charge will not change its earnings per share excluding items, the number that Wall Street tracks. The reinsurance deal is not unusual for Berkshire, which has done a number of transactions over the years with insurers seeking to rid themselves of a particular book of business. In April 2011, Berkshire struck a $1.65 billion deal with AIG (AIG.N) to take on that insurer’s U.S.-based asbestos risk. It did a similar deal with CNA Financial Corp (CNA.N) in 2010 and with a Lloyd’s of London LOL.UL affiliate in 2006.

395,BRKa,"Buffett, Brazil's 3G team up for $23 billion Heinz buyout","(Reuters) - Warren Buffett and Brazilian financier Jorge Paulo Lemann are teaming up to buy ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co for $23.2 billion, in what could be the first step of a wave of mergers for the food and beverage industry. Analysts and people close to the deal said Heinz could be a good starting point to consolidate similar staple food companies, particularly given the larger ambitions of Lemann’s private equity firm 3G Capital. Including debt assumption, Heinz valued the transaction, which it called the largest in its industry’s history, at $28 billion. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and 3G will pay $72.50 per share, a 19 percent premium to the stock’s previous all-time high. Heinz shares initially rose slightly above the offer price, although Buffett cautioned he had no intention of raising his bid and the stock fell back below that mark by midday. The stock has been on a tear, almost doubling over the last four years, though analysts said the price seemed fair. They also said the deal could be the first step in a broader wave of mergers for the food and beverage industry. “Maybe for the consumer staples group in general this may start some talk about consolidation. Even corporate entities are flush with cash, interest rates are low, it would seemingly make sense,” Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo said. Companies like General Mills and Campbell Soup - itself long seen as a potential Heinz merge partner - rose on the news. Any acquisition could help Heinz further diversify and broaden its international profile. It already dominates the ketchup business, with a nearly 26 percent share of the global market and a 59 percent share domestically, according to Euromonitor International. The company actually generates the largest portion of its sales in Europe, though its traditional North American consumer products business is the most profitable. But its real growth engine has been the Asia/Pacific region, where sales increased nearly 11 percent in the last fiscal year, in part on demand for sauces and infant foods in China. The surprise purchase satisfies, at least in part, Buffett’s hunt for growth through acquisition. He was frustrated in 2012 by the collapse of at least two unnamed deals in excess of $20 billion and said he might have to do a $30 billion deal this year to help fuel Berkshire’s growth engine. In a regulatory filing late on Thursday, Berkshire said it was providing $12.12 billion in equity, including common stock, warrants and preferred shares with a liquidation preference of $8 billion and a 9 percent dividend. Barclays Capital’s Jay Gelb the deal’s valuation appeared high at 19 times Heinz’s expected 2014 earnings per share, but that it would enhance Berkshire’s consumer portfolio. Berkshire Hathaway already has a variety of food assets, including Dairy Queen ice cream chain, chocolatier See’s Candies and food distributor McLane. Buffett, famed for a love of cheeseburgers, joked he was well acquainted with Heinz’s products already and that this was “my kind of deal.” It does represent an unusual teaming of Berkshire with private equity, though; historically, Buffett’s purchases have been outright his own. He and 3G founder Jorge Paulo Lemann have known each other for years, and Buffett said Lemann approached him with the Heinz idea in December. One Berkshire investor said he had mixed feelings about the deal because of the limited growth prospects domestically. “We’re a little hesitant on the staple companies because they don’t have any leverage in the United States,” said Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management in Seattle. But at the same time, he said, Buffett was likely willing to accept a bond-like steady return even if it was not necessarily a “home run.” A second investor, Michael Yoshikami of Destination Wealth Management in Walnut Creek, California, said he liked the purchase because it provided cash flow for other deals. “This is a better use of cash than current money market instruments,” said Yoshikami, the firm’s CEO and chairman of its investment committee. For 3G, a little-known firm with Brazilian roots, the purchase is something of a natural complement to its investment in fast-food chain Burger King, which it acquired in late 2010 and in which it still holds a major stake. Historically, 3G was more of an investor than an acquirer. Its biggest shareholdings include Delphi Automotive, Newell Rubbermaid and Anadarko Petroleum. Lemann, a globe-trotting financier with Swiss roots, made his money in banking and gained notoriety for helping to pull together the deals that ultimately formed the beer brewing giant AB InBev. Forbes ranks him as the world’s 69th-richest billionaire, with a fortune of $12 billion. 3G’s Alex Behring runs the fund out of New York. He appeared at a Pittsburgh news conference on Thursday with Heinz management to discuss the deal - and to reassure anxious local crowds that the company will remain based there and will continue to support local philanthropy. But at the same time, Behring said it was too soon to talk about cost cuts at the company. Unlike Berkshire, which is a hands-off operator, 3G is known for aggressively controlling costs at its operations. Also to be determined is whether CEO Bill Johnson would stay on. Only the fifth chairman in the company’s history, Johnson is widely credited with Heinz’s recent strong growth. “I am way too young to retire,” he told the news conference, adding that discussions had not yet started with 3G over the details of Heinz’s future management. The company, known for its iconic ketchup bottles, Heinz 57 sauces as well as other brands including Ore-Ida frozen potatoes, has increased net sales for the last eight fiscal years in a row. Heinz said the transaction would be financed with cash from Berkshire and 3G, debt rollover and debt financing from J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo. Buffett told CNBC that Berkshire and 3G would be equal equity partners. That would imply roughly $6 billion to $7 billion of new debt needs to be raised. Heinz shares soared 19.9 percent, or $12.02, to $72.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. A week ago the stock hit a long-term high of $61 a share - near records it set in 1998 - having risen almost 5 percent this year and nearly 12 percent since the beginning of 2012. The Heinz Endowments, a pillar in Pennsylvania philanthropy, said the sale of the company would have virtually no impact on their work. Heinz shares represent just over 1 percent of the endowment’s $1.4 billion in holdings. The deal is also a potential boon for new U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, whose wife, Teresa, is the widow of H.J. Heinz Co heir John Heinz. Kerry’s most recent financial disclosures from his time in the U.S. Senate show a position in Heinz shares of more than $1 million, although the precise size is unclear. Centerview Partners and BofA Merrill Lynch were financial advisers to Heinz, with Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP the legal adviser. Moelis & Company was financial adviser to the transaction committee of Heinz’s board and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz served as its legal adviser. Lazard served as lead financial adviser. J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo also served as financial advisers to the investment consortium. Kirkland & Ellis LLP was legal adviser to 3G Capital, and Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP was legal adviser to Berkshire Hathaway.

396,BRKa,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire adds ADM, more Wal-Mart in fourth qtr","* Raises DirecTV stake 15 pct, DaVita stake 33 pct * Takes new stakes in Archer Daniels Midland, VeriSign Feb 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway took a new stake in agribusiness heavyweight Archer Daniels Midland Co in the fourth quarter and added to positions in old favorites like Wal-Mart Stores Inc , according to a regulatory filing on Thursday. Many of the investment decisions were made not by Buffett himself but by his two investment managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs. Buffett has said only the changes in Berkshire’s biggest positions, like adding to holdings of Wal-Mart or Wells Fargo, were made by him. The portfolio was again active this quarter, with a number of large moves in a wide variety of stocks. While Buffett is the exemplar of buy-and-hold investing, he has indicated that at least one of the team of Weschler and Combs is inclined to trade more actively from quarter to quarter. Besides buying about 6 million shares of ADM — a stock that could appeal to Buffett’s farmer son Howard — Berkshire also added a new position of about 3.7 million shares in Internet registry manager Verisign Inc. Otherwise, Berkshire raised stakes in a number of old favorites. It added 33 percent more of dialysis clinic operator DaVita, raised its position in satellite broadcaster DirecTV by 15 percent and added almost 27 percent to its stake in National Oilwell Varco. Buffett added about 1.7 percent to the Wal-Mart position, and just over 4 percent to the stake in Wells Fargo, his favorite bank. Berkshire also reduced some positions, slashing its stake in one-time portfolio stalwart Johnson & Johnson by another 34 percent and its position in newspaper publisher Lee Enterprises by 92 percent. In the third quarter, Berkshire sold retailers and consumer heavyweight stocks but took new positions in industrial manufacturers like Deere & Co and Precision Castparts . Deere is the world’s largest agricultural equipment maker. Precision Castparts’ castings are used in every jet aircraft engine program in production or under development. It also took a position in Wabco Holdings, which makes braking and transmission products for the commercial truck market, and raised its stake by 50 percent in the automaker General Motors. In the third quarter Berkshire cut its long-time holding in Johnson & Johnson by 95 percent and also trimmed its Procter & Gamble position by another 11 percent. J&J; was one of Berkshire’s biggest investments by valuation over the last five years, but Buffett sold it aggressively in 2012, telling CNBC in February the company “has messed up in a lot of ways” in the recent past.",2142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshirehathaway-holdings/warren-buffetts-berkshire-adds-adm-more-wal-mart-in-fourth-qtr-idUSL1N0BDH0C20130214

402,BRKa,UPDATE 3-U.S. SEC sues over Heinz option trading before buyout,"* Says insider trades made via Swiss account * Gets order to freeze account’s assets * Second SEC action over 3G deal in six months Feb 15 (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators filed suit on Friday against unknown traders in the options of ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co, alleging they traded on inside information before the company announced a deal to be acquired for $23 billion by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc  and Brazil’s 3G Capital. The suit, in federal court in Manhattan, cites “highly suspicious trading” in Heinz call options just prior to the Feb. 14 announcement of the deal. The regulator has frequently in past filed suit against unnamed individuals where it has evidence of wrongdoing, but is still trying to uncover the identities of those involved. That trading, the suit said, caused the price of the particular call option they bought to soar 1,700 percent and generated unrealized profits of more than $1.7 million. The regulator claims the traders are either in, or trading through accounts in, Zurich, Switzerland. The account had no history of trading in Heinz over the last six or so months. It has also obtained an emergency order to freeze assets in the Swiss account linked to the trading. In the suit, the SEC refers to the account as the “GS Account” and in a statement Goldman Sachs Group Inc said it was cooperating with the regulator’s investigation. “Irregular and highly suspicious options trading immediately in front of a merger or acquisition announcement is a serious red flag that traders may be improperly acting on confidential nonpublic information,” Daniel Hawke, chief of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement’s Market Abuse Unit said in a statement. Representatives of Heinz and Berkshire Hathaway were unavailable for immediate comment. A 3G representative declined to comment. The founder of 3G, Jorge Paulo Lemann, is from Brazil, but has made a home in Switzerland since the 1990s. He has not been implicated in any wrongdoing related to the deal. After the deal was revealed on Thursday, options market experts called Wednesday’s trading “suspicious and incredibly well-timed.” The suit marks the second time in less than six months that the SEC has taken action over a 3G acquisition. In September 2012, the regulator got a court order to freeze the assets of a Wells Fargo & Co stockbroker who allegedly traded on inside information about 3G’s 2010 acquisition of Burger King. In that case, the SEC said the stockbroker got the information from a client who had invested in one of 3G’s funds. The suit also marks the second time in two years that controversy has erupted over a Berkshire acquisition target. In March 2011, Berkshire struck a deal to buy chemical company Lubrizol for $9 billion. Less than three weeks later, Berkshire said Buffett lieutenant David Sokol was resigning and disclosed he had been buying Lubrizol shares while pushing Buffett to acquire the company. The SEC dropped a probe into Sokol’s trading earlier this year. The suit is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Certain Unknown Traders in the Securities of H.J.

404,BRKa,Investors content to take Buffett's 20 percent Heinz premium,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett says he will not pay a penny more than the $72.50 a share he is already offering for ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co, and after an initial hesitation, most investors seem to be taking him at his word. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and the Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital struck a deal Thursday to buy Heinz for $23.2 billion in cash. The legendary investor made clear in a CNBC interview on Thursday that the bid was his final offer. The deal, which came together in less than two months, offers shareholders a 19 percent premium to what had been the stock’s all-time high and a 20 percent premium to the shares’ last pre-deal close. But for much of the day on Thursday, shares traded above the offer price, suggesting that some people were holding out hope for a better figure. That hoped-for figure does not appear to be coming anytime soon, though. “I’ll take a 20 percent premium in this environment any day. It’s rich enough that you avoid someone coming in and offering a little more, but then again it’s not necessarily in rarefied air,” said Matt McCormick, a portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor in Cincinnati, which holds Heinz shares. “Someone could have offered a little more but they’re likely not going to go through a proxy fight with Buffett.” Heinz shares ended Thursday precisely at the offer price, and as of Friday afternoon were down 0.4 percent at $72.22. At least half the sell-side analysts covering Heinz came out with notes following the deal describing the price as fair, or even a bit rich by historical standards. “We’re pleased with the deal — any time you can get a 20 percent premium on a food stock like this, it’s a good thing,” said Michael Sadoff, portfolio manager at Sadoff Investment Management in Milwaukee. The Berkshire/3G offer represents a price of just over 19 times expected fiscal 2014 earnings, which is Heinz’s next fiscal year. By comparison, the company’s self-identified peers trade for an average of 17.3 times the next fiscal year’s expected earnings. Taken another way, Berkshire is offering about 14 times expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Bankers familiar with the consumer staples sector say buyouts usually come in around 10 times EBITDA, suggesting again that Buffett was offering a full price. “The premium seems fine to us. We’ve held on to Heinz for a few years and it’s been a good one for us. Of course we’ll have to find something else to buy that’s comparable, but I’m not complaining,” said Michael Aronstein, president and chief investment officer at Marketfield Asset Management in New York. Raising the bid even $1 would require just over $320 million in extra cash, a relatively small sum for such a large offer. Whether the buyers would come up the extra cash, though, is the question. Buffett is fond of take-it-or-leave-it offers and is not one, historically, for renegotiating. Berkshire is also putting three times more cash into the deal than 3G, raising questions as to how they would split any increase. “We don’t think it’s likely he’d raise the premium. Warren doesn’t respond to pressure — he’d just walk away if there was opposition,” Aronstein said.

We’ve held on to Heinz for a few years and it’s been a good one for us. Of course we’ll have to find something else to buy that’s comparable, but I’m not complaining,” said Michael Aronstein, president and chief investment officer at Marketfield Asset Management in New York. Raising the bid even $1 would require just over $320 million in extra cash, a relatively small sum for such a large offer. Whether the buyers would come up the extra cash, though, is the question. Buffett is fond of take-it-or-leave-it offers and is not one, historically, for renegotiating. Berkshire is also putting three times more cash into the deal than 3G, raising questions as to how they would split any increase. “We don’t think it’s likely he’d raise the premium. Warren doesn’t respond to pressure - he’d just walk away if there was opposition,” Aronstein said.",2152013,http://www.reuters.com/article/heinz-berkshire/investors-content-to-take-buffetts-20-pct-heinz-premium-idUSL1N0BF6CF20130215

407,BRKa,SEC sues over Heinz option trading before buyout,"(Reuters) - Securities regulators filed suit on Friday against unknown traders in the options of ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co, alleging they traded on inside information before the company announced a deal to be acquired for $23 billion by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and Brazil’s 3G Capital. The suit marks the second time in six months that the SEC has taken legal action for alleged insider trading on a 3G deal. The suit, in federal court in Manhattan, cites “highly suspicious trading” in Heinz call options just prior to the February 14 announcement of the deal. The regulator has frequently in past filed suit against unnamed individuals where it has evidence of wrongdoing, but is still trying to uncover the identities of those involved. That trading, the suit said, caused the price of the particular call option they bought to soar 1,700 percent and generated unrealized profits of more than $1.7 million. The regulator claims the traders are either in, or trading through accounts in, Zurich, Switzerland. The account had no history of trading in Heinz over the last six or so months. It has also obtained an emergency order to freeze assets in the Swiss account linked to the trading. In the suit, the SEC refers to the account as the “GS Account” and in a statement Goldman Sachs Group Inc said it was cooperating with the regulator’s investigation. “Irregular and highly suspicious options trading immediately in front of a merger or acquisition announcement is a serious red flag that traders may be improperly acting on confidential nonpublic information,” Daniel Hawke, chief of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement’s Market Abuse Unit said in a statement. Representatives of Heinz and Berkshire Hathaway were unavailable for immediate comment. A 3G representative declined to comment. The founder of 3G, Jorge Paulo Lemann, is from Brazil, but has made a home in Switzerland since the 1990s. He has not been implicated in any wrongdoing related to the deal. After the deal was revealed on Thursday, options market experts called Wednesday’s trading “suspicious and incredibly well-timed.” The suit marks the second time in less than six months that the SEC has taken action over a 3G acquisition. In September 2012, the regulator got a court order to freeze the assets of a Wells Fargo & Co stockbroker who allegedly traded on inside information about 3G’s 2010 acquisition of Burger King. In that case, the SEC said the Brazilian stockbroker got the information from a client who had invested at least $50 million in one of 3G’s funds. The suit also marks the second time in two years that controversy has erupted over a Berkshire acquisition target. In March 2011, Berkshire struck a deal to buy chemical company Lubrizol for $9 billion. Less than three weeks later, Berkshire said Buffett lieutenant David Sokol was resigning and disclosed he had been buying Lubrizol shares while pushing Buffett to acquire the company. The SEC dropped a probe into Sokol’s trading earlier this year. The suit is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Certain Unknown Traders in the Securities of H.J.

409,BRKa,Judge extends freeze on account linked to Heinz trades,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has extended a freeze on a Swiss account linked to possible insider trading in H.J. Heinz Co HNZ.N call options just before the ketchup maker agreed to be bought by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) and Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had last Friday won a temporary freeze of the account at Goldman Sachs & Co, one day after Berkshire and 3G announced a $23 billion takeover of Heinz. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan had ordered the temporary freeze, and at a hearing on Friday called the SEC request to extend the freeze “very well warranted.” Rakoff had ordered the trader or traders behind the suspicious trades, who have not been publicly identified, to attend Friday’s hearing, but unsurprisingly none showed up. “They can hide but their assets can’t run,” Rakoff said. SEC lawyer Charles Riely told the judge he had no further details on who made the trades. The FBI and SEC are investigating unusual activity in Heinz call options just ahead of the merger, which the SEC has said resulted in $1.7 million of unrealized profit in the Swiss account, held by a Goldman private wealth client. These probes recall similar investigations in the middle of the last decade, when a surge in trading activity often preceded announcements of huge buyouts. Swiss authorities on Friday said they will aid U.S. investigators examining the trades, which options markets participants had noticed almost immediately after the Heinz takeover was announced. “We’re in touch with the SEC and will, as in all cases of this nature, cooperate to the extent of our legal possibilities,” Swiss financial regulator FINMA said in a statement on Friday. Call options allow a buyer to purchase a company’s shares at a fixed price in the future, and are a bet that a company’s stock price will rise. Roland Leithaeuser, a Frankfurt-based spokesman for Goldman, said the investment bank is cooperating fully with the SEC. Goldman has not been accused of wrongdoing. Heinz, Berkshire and 3G have all declined to comment. The Brazilian founder of 3G, Jorge Paulo Lemann, has made a home in Switzerland since the 1990s.

410,BRKa,Swiss authorities to aid Heinz insider-dealing probe,"ZURICH, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Swiss authorities said they will aid a U.S. investigation into alleged insider trading in connection with H.J. Heinz Co the day before it was announced that the company would be sold. Options markets participants noted extremely unusual activity almost immediately after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and Brazil’s 3G Capital said last Thursday that they would buy Heinz for $23 billion in cash. Last week the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a suit against unnamed traders who it said used a Goldman Sachs   account in Switzerland to trade on purported inside knowledge of the transaction. “We’re in touch with the SEC and will, as in all cases of this nature, cooperate to the extent of our legal possibilities,” Swiss financial regulator FINMA said in a statement on Friday. The traded call options - agreements that gives the option to buy the shares at a pre-determined price at a specified date - are also being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Roland Leithaeuser, a Frankfurt-based spokesman for Goldman Sachs, said that the U.S. investment bank is cooperating fully with the SEC’s investigation. Goldman Sachs has not been accused of wrong-doing. Heinz, Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital have all declined to comment.

412,BRKa,Buffett: Performance streak may end this year,"(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway may end a long streak of outperforming the S&P; 500 this year, Chief Executive Warren Buffett warned shareholders on Friday, even as he said he was still eagerly hunting for acquisitions to grow the ice-cream-to-insurance conglomerate. In his annual letter to investors, Buffett opened up with a caution that this year, for the first time, the growth in Berkshire’s book value per share may underperform the growth in the S&P; 500 when measured over a five-year period. “To date, we’ve never had a five-year period of underperformance, having managed 43 times to surpass the S&P; over such a stretch,” he wrote. “But the S&P; has now had gains in each of the last four years, outpacing us over that period. If the market continues to advance in 2013, our streak of five-year wins will end.” Buffett said he expects the growth in Berkshire’s intrinsic business value will over time exceed the S&P;’s returns by small margins. But at the same time, he said the firm would continue to underperform in a strong market like this year. Long-time Berkshire investors said they detected almost a sense of frustration in this year’s letter. “He’s gotten away from some of the things that used to just matter to him so much,” said Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management in Seattle. “He has so much capital I don’t think he can just rely on a stock portfolio the way he used to.” Just last month, Berkshire struck a deal to put $12 billion of that capital toward the $23 billion cash buyout of ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co. Buffett said he and vice chairman Charlie Munger were not done. “But we still have plenty of cash and are generating more at a good clip. So it’s back to work; Charlie and I have again donned our safari outfits and resumed our search for elephants,” Buffett said in the annual letter. Berkshire reported $47 billion of cash on hand at December 31. Backing out the Heinz deal, and even with Buffett’s preferred $20 billion cash cushion intact, that would leave Berkshire at least $15 billion to spend. Another long-term Buffett investor said he was perfectly content with Berkshire’s returns precisely because of all that cash generation. “It was an accurate assessment on his part in terms of performance, but I’ll tell you as a shareholder I’m not terribly disappointed,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive and chairman of the investment committee at Destination Wealth Management in Walnut Creek, California. “We buy it because it’s a cash flow oriented position. If I get outperformance it’s a win.” Buffett did not hint at what sort of companies he would like to acquire, except note that one thing he will buy more of are newspapers. Despite a years-long aversion to the business, Berkshire has of late been buying up papers in smaller communities across the country. Buffett said Friday he will continue to do so. “At appropriate prices - and that means at a very low multiple of current earnings - we will purchase more papers of the type we like,” he said. He also noted that Berkshire would keep buying papers even if they did not meet the firm’s stated investment criteria for other companies, as long as the economics of any deal made sense. Berkshire employs more than 288,000 people worldwide in dozens of business. Buffett serves as chairman, chief executive and chief investment officer. When he leaves, at least four people will replace him in those various roles. Buffett’s annual shareholder letter is one of the most closely read public statements by any investor or executive in corporate America. It often comes out early on a Saturday morning, and Buffett devotees have been known to set aside an entire weekend to read and digest it. (It was released Friday night this time for scheduling reasons related to SEC filing deadlines). Buffett also offered a lengthy treatise on the upside - and downside - of companies paying dividends to shareholders, by way of explaining why Berkshire would continue its policy of not paying one out. Buffett devoted three full pages from the 24-page letter to explaining his philosophy. Destination Wealth’s Yoshikami suggested that was a nod to the recent attention on companies like Apple Inc with huge cash piles. “I think investors aren’t necessarily clamoring for dividends, they just want clarity on what you’re doing with your cash,” he said. Buffett, in his treatise, made the basic argument that Berkshire has always prioritized using cash to expand its businesses and will continue to do so, particularly if it can find blockbuster deals like the BNSF railroad. “I have made plenty of mistakes in acquisitions and will make more. Overall, however, our record is satisfactory, which means that our shareholders are far wealthier today than they would be if the funds we used for acquisitions had instead been devoted to share repurchases or dividends,” he wrote. Buffett is asked every year at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha about a payout, and most investors have been content to accept his reasoning against one. Smead said he understood Buffett’s position but said his philosophy was easier said than followed for most of the investing public. “I’m a long-term Buffett fan and I don’t agree because I know what happens in the lives of most investors and most investors need some cash flow from these wonderful companies that they own,” he said. Berkshire also reported earnings on Friday, posting a larger fourth-quarter profit on derivative gains. The company posted a profit of $4.56 billion, or $2,757 per Class A share, compared with a profit of $3.05 billion or $1,846 per Class A share, a year earlier. Year-end book value, Buffett’s preferred measure of the stock’s worth, rose 14 percent to $114,214 per share. Earnings were boosted by $1.4 billion in derivative gains during the quarter. Berkshire has in the past sold derivatives to provide credit protection on corporate bonds, and also long-term puts on international stock indexes. Buffett said Friday that Berkshire continues to wind down that portion of its portfolio, given an aversion to posting collateral if it took on new risks. Berkshire reported 15 common stock investments that were worth $1 billion or more at year’s end. For the first time, this year’s list includes not only purchases by Buffett, but by Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, the investment managers Buffett brought in to help oversee Berkshire’s portfolio. Their one investment that met the threshold was the satellite TV operator DirecTV. Each man is now managing about $5 billion, Buffett said Friday. “Todd and Ted are young and will be around to manage Berkshire’s massive portfolio long after Charlie and I have left the scene. You can rest easy when they take over,” he wrote. ",3012013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-buffett-letter/buffett-performance-streak-may-end-this-year-idUSBRE92011J20130301

Heinz Co Chief Executive William Johnson would receive about $56 million if he gets terminated following the ketchup maker’s acquisition by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital, the company said on Monday. In its preliminary proxy statement, the world’s largest ketchup maker also said the merger agreement, announced on Feb. 14, has been amended so that restricted stock units would vest in keeping with their existing schedule instead of all at once at the time of the merger. Heinz spokesman Michael Mullen said Johnson’s “golden parachute” payment would reflect his success in building shareholder value over his 15 years as CEO. “This compensation consists of equity that Mr. Johnson accumulated over his 30-year career with Heinz and existing equity awards and contractual rights that were in place well before the announcement of the proposed merger,” Mullen said. Arthur Winkleblack, chief financial officer, and David Moran, CEO of Heinz Europe and its global infant nutrition business, would each get about $15.5 million in a similar scenario, Heinz said. The filing also showed that the initial offer for Heinz, made by Brazilian private equity firm 3G and Berkshire, was for $70 per share.

421,BRKa,Berkshire on hunt for more Heinz-like deals: Buffett,"(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) is on the hunt for more deals similar to its planned purchase of H.J. Heinz Co HNZ.N, Warren Buffett, the conglomerate’s chief executive, said on Monday. “If we get a chance to buy another Heinz, we will do that,” Buffett said on CNBC-TV. Berkshire likes the ketchup maker’s business, the deal’s $23 billion price, and its partner in the transaction, private equity firm 3G Capital, Buffett said in an extended interview. “We hope to own Heinz 100 years from now,” Buffett said. “If you own great brands and you take care of them, they’re terrific assets.” Buffett said he is not currently eyeing another consumer- products company, but is looking at a possible deal in a sector he would not disclose. After a recent binge of buying newspapers, he said he is not interested in buying the Chicago Tribune or the Los Angeles Times from the Tribune Co. However, he has been buying papers in smaller communities and said Friday he planned to continue doing so. After the Heinz purchase was announced, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against unnamed traders the agency said used a Goldman Sachs (GS.N) account in Switzerland to trade on purported inside knowledge of the transaction. Buffett said Berkshire likes to move quickly on deals to avoid information leaks, and said he could “guarantee” the person who made questionable options trades ahead of the deal was acting on inside information. “They will nail that guy, and they should,” he said. Monday’s interview followed the release Friday of Buffett’s annual letter to Berkshire shareholders. In the closely followed missive, the billionaire investor said Berkshire may end a long streak of outperforming the S&P; 500 this year. For the first time, the growth in Berkshire’s book value per share may underperform the growth in the stock index when measured over a five-year period. In the interview, Buffett said Berkshire is buying stocks because they are cheaper than other types of investments. “We are buying them not because we expect them to go up,” he said. “We’re buying them because we think we’re getting good value for them.” Buffett remained optimistic about the U.S. economy despite gridlock in Washington over fiscal issues and a tepid economic recovery. “It hasn’t taken off,” he said of the recovery, “but it hasn’t stopped.” In the CNBC interview, Buffett said he will be giving Berkshire money managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler more money to invest after a successful year. As of March 31, they will both manage about $6 billion each, up from $5 billion apiece, Buffett said. “Todd and Ted are young and will be around to manage Berkshire’s massive portfolio long after (Berkshire Vice Chairman) Charlie (Munger) and I have left the scene,” Buffett wrote in Friday’s letter. “You can rest easy when they take over.” One of the stocks that Berkshire has an interest in is Bank of America Corp (BAC.N). In August 2011, Buffett purchased $5 billion in preferred shares as the U.S. bank was struggling amid concerns about its capital levels. The deal also included warrants that allow Berkshire to buy 700 million shares of the bank’s common stock at a price of $7.14 over 10 years. The shares are currently trading above $11. “They are doing the right things,” he said of Bank of America. “..over time, they will do well.” Buffett also cleared up the mystery around the “credentialed bear” investor who will get a chance to ask questions at Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting this spring: Hedge fund manager, Doug Kass. Kass took to Twitter to say “I am going to Disneyland, I mean Omaha!” to take part in the meeting in May.

Last Friday, Buffett said in his annual letter to shareholders that he wanted to spice up the panel with someone who was bearish on - and preferably short - Berkshire’s stock. As of late Friday, he still had not found that person. But in an interview on CNBC Monday morning, Buffett said he had chosen Kass, the president of Seabreeze Partners Management in Florida and a well-known media personality in his own right. He has a short position in Berkshire’s more actively traded Class B shares (BRKb.N). “Bring your tough questions,” Buffett said. “See if you can drive the stock down 10 percent.” Kass took to Twitter to say: “I am going to Disneyland, I mean Omaha!” to take part in the meeting in May. “I am surprised, honored and flattered,” he said in a follow-up email to his contacts. The analyst panel was a new innovation at Berkshire’s 2012 annual meeting, although in that instance it was comprised of three sell-side insurance analysts. This year the panel will have one insurance analyst, Cliff Gallant of Nomura Securities; one investor, Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb; and Kass.

430,BRKa,Fitch Downgrades Heinz to 'BB-' & Rates Proposed Debt; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has resolved the Rating Watch Negative  placed on H.J. Heinz Company (Heinz) and its subsidiaries on Feb. 15, 2013  following the Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (Berkshire) and 3G Partners Ltd. (3G)  buyout announcement. The transaction is valued at $28 billion, including the  assumption of $5.3 billion of debt including hedge accounting adjustments at  Jan. 27, 2013, and represents roughly 13.0x Heinz's LTM EBITDA of $2.2 billion.  The buyout is expected to close in the third quarter of 2013, subject to  shareholder and regulatory approval. The financing terms and expected capital  structure have been reviewed.  On the assumption that the buyout will occur, Fitch has downgraded the long-term  ratings of H.J. Heinz Company (Heinz) and its subsidiaries and revised the  Rating Outlook to Stable.   Fitch has downgraded the following ratings: H.J. Heinz Co.  --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BB-' from 'BB+'; --Senior unsecured notes to 'BB-' from 'BB+'. H.J. Heinz Finance Co.  --Long-term IDR to 'BB-' from 'BB+'; --Senior unsecured notes to 'BB-' from 'BB+'. H.J. Heinz Finance UK Plc.  --Long-term IDR to 'BB-' from 'BB+'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BB-' from 'BB+'. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: H.J. Heinz Co --Short-term IDR at 'B'; --Commercial paper (CP) at 'B'; --Bank facilities at 'BB+'. H.J. Heinz Finance Co. --Short-term IDR at 'B'; --CP at 'B'; --Bank facilities at 'BB+' (as co-borrower); --Series B Preferred Stock at 'BB-'. Fitch has concurrently assigned the following ratings to the proposed debt used  to finance the buyout by Berkshire and 3G:  Hawk Acquisition Sub., Inc. (to be merged into H.J. Heinz Co. at closing) --Secured credit facility 'BB+'; --2nd lien notes 'BB'. Hawk Acquisition Holding Corp. (Parent) --Long-term IDR 'BB-'. Fitch expects to withdraw the following ratings on existing facilities upon  closing of the transaction: H.J. Heinz Co.  --Bank facilities 'BB+'; --Commercial paper (CP) 'B'. H.J. Heinz Finance Co.  --Bank facilities 'BB+' (as co-borrower). --CP 'B'; --Series B Preferred Stock 'BB-'. Financing for the buyout includes $4.12 billion of common equity from 3G and  $12.12 billion of equity, inclusive of $8 billion of preferred equity with  warrants, from Berkshire. Additionally, Hawk Acquisition Sub., Inc. (Hawk)  intends to issue $10.5 billion of first-priority term loans due 2019 and 2020  along with a $1.5 billion first-priority revolver. Hawk also plans to issue $2.1  billion of long-term second-lien notes at or prior to transaction close or enter  into a second-lien bridge facility of up to $2.1 billion to the extent such  notes are not issued. Key Rating Drivers: The rating actions balance Heinz's highly leveraged capital structure post  buyout with its low business risk, above-average revenue growth, potentially  higher operating income as a private firm, and consistent cash flow generation.  3G has proven its ability to increase operating profitability and de-lever  acquired firms. Anheuser Busch InBev NV/SA and Burger King Worldwide, Inc. both  experienced significant margin expansion and steady deleveraging after being  acquired by 3G. Fitch expects Heinz's operating EBITDA growth to exceed the firm's 4%-6%  historical average under its new ownership structure due to the combination of  mid-single digit organic revenue growth and cost reductions. Fitch also believes  Heinz is capable of generating average annual FCF of more than $200 million over  the two years following the buyout, despite a substantial increase in interest  expense and $720 million of annual preferred dividends. Annual operating cash  flow and FCF averaged $1.2 billion and over $425 million, respectively over the  past 10 years. Heinz's low business risk and the stability of its operations have been  demonstrated over time as the firm's revenue and operating earnings held up well  during the recent global economic slowdown. Even with an approximate 30%  exposure to pressured European consumers, the firm has continued to take pricing  and grow volumes. Growth in emerging markets will continue to outpace that of  developed markets with opportunities to further expand Heinz's core portfolio of  meals/snacks, ketchup/sauces, and infant nutrition around the globe in both  retail and foodservice.  Integrated into the ratings is Fitch's treatment of the $8 billion 9% cumulative  perpetual preferred stock to be held by Berkshire. Fitch has classified 50% of  the principal as equity and 50% as debt. The terms of the preferred allow for  dividend deferral and the existence of incentives to issue common equity reduces  the company's overall financial risk. Pro forma total debt adjusted for the  equity treatment of these hybrid securities will approximate $17 billion and  total debt with equity credit-to-operating EBITDA will exceed 7.0x, up from  roughly $5 billion and 2.4x, respectively for the LTM period ended Jan. 27,  2013. Nonetheless, Fitch anticipates that total debt with equity credit-to-operating EBITDA can decline to below 6.0x within two years of the  buyout based on significant anticipated operating earnings growth and modest  debt reduction. The ratings also incorporate Heinz's product and geographic diversification and  leading market share positions in major product categories. Ketchup and sauces  represented 45% of fiscal 2012 sales while meals and snacks represented 38%,  infant nutrition represented 11%, and other products represented the remaining  6%. Heinz generates about two-thirds of its sales outside the U.S., with  emerging markets representing nearly 25% of the firm's $11.6 billion of revenue.  For the nine months ended Jan. 27, 2013, organic revenue growth was 3.7% due to  2.1% pricing and 1.6% volume growth. Volume gains in emerging markets were  partially offset by declines in Continental Europe, Australia, and Italy while  pricing increased across developing markets as well as in Continental Europe and  U.S. food service. Reported operating income increased 9.4% to $1.28 billion for  the nine-month period due to benefits of higher pricing, volume, and  productivity initiatives. Liquidity, Maturities, Covenants, and Collateral: Heinz has historically maintained high levels of liquidity with year-end cash  averaging over $1 billion since 2011. Liquidity and on-going financial  flexibility is expected to remain adequate despite considerable debt levels  following the buyout. Heinz will maintain a $1.5 billion five-year revolver and  is expected to continue to hold high cash balances as cash flow generation  remains robust. Fitch views the ability to defer $720 million preferred dividend  as being a potential lever partners could pull should there be an unanticipated  deterioration in cash flow and/or liquidity constraints. Berkshire's 50% common  equity stake supports this view. Solid FCF generation will be enabled by EBITDA growth and the potential for  additional working capital improvement. The $720 preferred dividend is a  moderately incremental replacement to the $650 million of common dividends  distributed by Heinz prior to the buyout. Capital expenditures should also  decline modestly as spending behind Heinz's Project Keystone, a multi-year  program to drive productivity and standardize systems, comes to an end. Maturities will be limited in the intermediate term, eliminating refinancing  risk should market conditions worsen. Debt incurred for the transaction is  expected to have maturities five to seven years out. Financial covenants are  expected to be minimal for the newly issued debt. Existing debt that will not be  refinanced as part of this transaction (roll over notes) are long dated and are  not likely to be due until 2028, 2030, 2032 and 2039.  In terms of collateral, the first-priority debt will be secured by a perfected  first-priority security interest in substantially all tangible and intangible  property with carve-outs that include Principal Property as defined by  indentures governing rollover notes. Based on Fitch's interpretation this  includes the gross book value of certain manufacturing, processing plant or  warehouses located in the U.S. Fitch views the value of the collateral as  meaningful as it is substantially based on the value of Heinz's trademarks;  which include namesake Heinz, Ore-Ida, and Smart Ones. Collateral for  junior-lien debt will include a second-priority security interest in assets  securing the first-priority debt.   Rating Sensitivities: An upgrade of Heinz's ratings is not anticipated in the near term. However,  faster than expected deleveraging, accelerated top line growth, and greater than  projected cost reductions would be viewed positively making upward migration in  ratings possible. A commitment to operating with total debt with equity  credit-to-operating EBITDA below 5.0x and continued generations of meaningful  FCF would also be a prerequisite for any upgrades.  Further downgrades could occur if deleveraging is slower than Fitch expected or  total debt with equity credit-to-operating EBITDA is maintained in the 7.0x  range. Failure to achieve cost reduction targets, weakening organic growth or  margin contraction, or increased debt levels could trigger adverse rating  actions. The inability to generate FCF or a sustained loss of market share in  core product categories would also be viewed negatively.

431,BRKa,Heinz moves closer to cementing buyout funding,"March 21 (IFR) - Ketchup giant H.J. Heinz took more key steps Thursday toward funding its $28 billion acquisition by 3G Capital and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, moving to an all-dollar loans package while drumming up huge demand for a new bond issue. As Heinz tries to cement another piece of funding for the largest buyout in the history of the food industry, bankers said the company had dropped plans for euro- and sterling-denominated loans due to strong demand from US investors. The new and simpler all-dollar structure reportedly disappointed many European bankers and investors keen to get a piece of one of the most spectacular leveraged buyouts (LBOs) in recent years. “The view is that it is the most efficient, easiest and cleanest way - to issue in one currency,” a banker said. The original loans package consisted of a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and $10.5 billion in term loans split into a six-year term loan B1 tranche and a seven-year term loan B2 tranche. It was not immediately clear if that structure would be maintained. The term loans had been planned to include an $8.5 billion dollar-denominated loan, as well as up to $1.4 billion in euros and around $600 million in sterling. There has reportedly been massive demand for paper on the deal, which brings together one of the world’s most iconic investors in Buffett and a company that is a household name in many corners of the globe. It also brings in Burger King’s majority Brazilian owner, private equity firm 3G Capital, which Buffett announced would run the Heinz business after the buyout. “Investors like that 3G has been successful in the Burger King buyout, and Buffett being involved is a huge positive,” one bond investor said. Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital are buying Heinz for $72.50 per share, a 19 percent premium to the company’s previous record high stock price at the time the deal was announced in mid-February. Including debt assumption, Heinz valued the transaction at $28 billion. JP Morgan and Wells Fargo are joint bookrunners for the loans financing, while sub-underwriting banks on the deal include Banco do Brasil, Barclays, Citigroup, HSBC, Itau Unibanco, RBC, UBS and others. Lender commitments are due at midday on Friday. In addition to the loans, Heinz also plans to roll over some existing debt not covered under change of control provisions. Total equity investment in the transaction is $16.24 billion. Berkshire Hathaway is committing $12.12 billion - $8 billion preferred (9% dividend) and $4.12 billion common equity. 3G will invest US$4.12bn in common equity. Meanwhile Heinz is also selling $2.1 billion in second-lien notes to refinance a second-lien bridge loan. Investors said the B1/BB- rated bond issue, which prices on Friday, has been a blowout, with massive demand that has allowed Heinz to shave more than a full percentage point off of pricing expectations, to official guidance of 4.5% area from initial price thoughts of 5.75%. While that rate has been roughly typical of Double B-rated bond deals in recent weeks, it’s certainly not the norm to see debt being used to fund an LBO that prices with such a low coupon, or rate of interest. “This is being priced like a very strong non-LBO Double B bond,” said the bond investor. “There is definitely an intangible glow around this deal.” But he cautioned: “In my view, it’s still a highly leveraged transaction.” Order books on the bond deal - structured as a 7.5-year non-call two second-lien senior secured deal - were to close at 5pm New York time on Thursday afternoon. Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, Barclays and Citi are joint bookrunners on the trade. In the run-up to the deadline, Heinz on Thursday issued a supplement to its preliminary bond offering memorandum saying that Berkshire Hathaway, through Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corporation, may offer bond insurance separately to holders of the new Heinz notes. A market source said the insurance could be in the form of credit default swaps (CDS). “I think he’s doing this because he’s got a lot of confidence that it’s a solid deal,” the investor said. “And the more Buffett commits, the more investors love it. It’s like a seal of approval.” Even so, Heinz’s credit ratings were hit by the transaction. Fitch immediately downgraded Heinz from investment-grade to junk bond status when the deal was announced in February, dropping it to BB+ from BBB+. Last week it downgraded Heinz again to BB- from BB+. S&P; plans to lower the rating to BB- after the buyout is completed. Moody’s rates the corporate family at Ba3, which reflects the high degree of leverage from the transaction of roughly 6.3x debt/Ebitda, although if including the US$8bn of preferred stock that is being bought by Berkshire Hathaway, that would rise to 10 times. Moody’s said cash flow metrics are weakened by high interest expense and at least US$720m of dividends, which it assumes will be upstreamed annually to service the 9% parent company preferred stock issued to Berkshire.

437,BRKa,UPDATE 1-Swiss Re to get $610 million in Berkshire settlement,"* Deal expected to give Swiss Re a $100 mln first-quarter gain * Berkshire payments may not cover future losses * Berkshire’s exposure to potential claims reduced by $450 mln ZURICH, March 28 (Reuters) - Swiss Re has settled a dispute with Berkshire Hathaway over a 2010 life reinsurance deal and will receive a $610 million payment from U.S. tycoon Warren Buffett’s company, the Swiss reinsurer said on Thursday. Under the original January 2010 deal, Swiss Re agreed to transfer a U.S. life reinsurance contract to Berkshire for 1.3 billion Swiss francs ($1.36 billion), allowing it to reinvest capital more profitably elsewhere. That allowed Buffett’s Berkshire to pocket premiums payable under the contract, while taking responsibility for paying up to $1.5 billion in potential claims. Swiss Re said in a statement that Berkshire’s exposure to potential claims will be reduced to $1.05 billion from $1.5 billion and that the deal is expected to provide Swiss Re with an initial first-quarter gain of $100 million. The company said the effect of the agreement beyond the first quarter would depend on the performance of the business taken back from Berkshire as well as the business still covered under the original deal. “There is no assurance that the payments received from Berkshire Hathaway will be sufficient to cover future losses,” the Swiss group said in a statement. Swiss Re said that, including the payments agreed in the settlement, it had recovered a total of $815 million from Berkshire to date.

439,BRKa,"Berkshire size, Buffett age cloud annual gathering","(Reuters) - Warren Buffett may be on safari for major acquisitions, which he likes to call elephants, but shareholders may wonder if his Berkshire Hathaway Inc has become the biggest elephant in the room. Berkshire has grown to look more and more like corporate America, as Buffett expands outside its core insurance business into such areas as energy, industrial products, newspapers, and in February ketchup, when he teamed up with Brazil’s 3G Capital investment firm to buy H.J. Heinz Co for $23.2 billion. Few of the 35,000 or more people who will this weekend make a pilgrimage to Berkshire’s hometown of Omaha, Nebraska for the company’s annual shareholder weekend, which Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists,” are likely to criticize that strategy. While Buffett has managed to handily beat the Standard & Poor’s 500 so far this year, outperforming the overall market is getting tougher for Berkshire as it grows and diversifies, investors and analysts said. Buffett, 82, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 89, will at Saturday’s annual meeting field five hours of questions about the company, governance, the economy and - with a $15 billion cash cushion even after the Heinz purchase is completed - their next elephant. “Larger deals are needed to move the needle,” said Doug Kass, founder of hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management Inc, who has shorted Berkshire stock partly because its size, including a $262 billion market value, makes it more difficult to record market-beating returns. Kass has been tapped by Buffett as a “credentialed bear” to ask questions and “spice up” the meeting. Buffett himself recognized the performance question when he noted in his March shareholder letter that Berkshire has lagged the broader market since the latter bottomed out four years ago. “To date, we’ve never had a five-year period of underperformance, having managed 43 times to surpass the S&P; over such a stretch,” he wrote. “If the market continues to advance in 2013, our streak of five-year wins will end.” Some investors will also ask how long a man of Buffett’s age, even one who recently beat prostate cancer, can remain at the helm of the company he has led since 1965. “There is nothing the board can do to halt the aging of the CEO, but it has no higher priority than to prepare for succession,” said Thomas Russo, a partner at Gardner, Russo & Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which invests 11 percent of its more than $6 billion of assets in Berkshire. Kass also said the company will have to face up to the difficulty of replacing “the single greatest stock investor of all time” probably sooner rather than later. Buffett is the world’s fourth-richest person and owns 21.4 percent of Berkshire, whose board includes Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder and the world’s second-richest person. Berkshire has more than 80 subsidiaries selling such things as Russell athletic apparel, Geico car insurance, chemicals and furniture. It owns the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad and dozens of newspapers, including the Omaha World-Herald. It will report first-quarter results for those businesses on Friday. The company also ended last year with $87.7 billion of common stocks, including nearly half in just three companies: Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. But the Heinz purchase will add to the roughly two-thirds of operating profit already generated by businesses outside insurance. Such sprawl has made it harder for the company’s stock, which does not throw off dividends, to outperform. Indeed, it was not until February that the share price of Berkshire surpassed the record it had set more than five years earlier, in December 2007. The S&P; 500 returned about 15.4 percent over that time, including dividends. Through Monday, Berkshire stock is up 19.1 percent this year, compared with an 11.7 percent rise for the index. James Armstrong, president of Henry H. Armstrong Associates in Pittsburgh, which invests 22 percent of its $400 million of assets in Berkshire, said the company’s businesses remain appealing. “If Buffett dies tonight, nothing changes in those businesses,” said Armstrong, who said he is attending his 22nd straight annual meeting. “Earnings power has grown enormously, and stock prices often don’t track that power in the short run.” Buffett measures performance by dividing shareholder equity, equal to assets minus liabilities, by the number of shares, creating book value per share. By this measure, Berkshire has trounced the S&P; 500 including dividends over the long haul. However, book value is less relevant than the stock price for shareholders trying to realize the value of Berkshire shares by selling them. And while Berkshire’s stock is less than half as volatile as the S&P; 500, the similarity is growing. About 60 percent of the movement in Berkshire’s stock could be explained by movement in the S&P; 500 in the year ended March 31, up from less than one-fourth over five- and 10-year periods, according to Morningstar Inc. Berkshire plans after Buffett leaves to split his role in three, with his son, Howard, serving as non-executive chairman and one or more others serving as chief investment officer. The latter could include Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who each manage some of Berkshire’s investments. Berkshire’s board has also chosen an internal manager, not named publicly, as chief executive. Previously, Buffett has said that he would like his successor young enough to serve for 15 years. Investors now believe this person could be insurance chief Ajit Jain, Burlington Northern railroad chief Matthew Rose, MidAmerican Energy chief Greg Abel, or perhaps even Weschler. Buffett and Munger will take questions at the meeting from shareholders, three journalists, two industry analysts and Kass. Events are also scheduled throughout the weekend in Omaha’s largest annual tourism event other than baseball’s College World Series. Shareholders can get discounts at Berkshire-owned businesses on everything from See’s candies to Brooks running shoes. For just $5, the sartorially inclined can splurge for a pair of unisex boxer shorts from Berkshire’s Fruit of the Loom, emblazoned with a cartoon of Buffett and Munger.

441,BRKa,Berkshire buys rest of Israel's Iscar for $2.05 billion,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Wednesday said it paid $2.05 billion cash to buy the 20 percent it did not already own of toolmaker Iscar from the Israeli company’s founding Wertheimer family. Berkshire in 2006 bought an 80 percent stake in Iscar, a maker of metal cutting tools whose formal name is IMC International Metalworking Cos, for $4 billion. At the time, that purchase was one of the largest acquisitions involving an Israeli company, and Buffett’s biggest bet outside the United States. Wednesday’s purchase suggests that Iscar’s value has since more than doubled. “As you can surmise from the price we’re paying for the remaining interest, IMC has enjoyed very significant growth over the last seven years,” Buffett said in a statement. The acquisition was announced three days before Buffett will welcome more than 35,000 people to Berkshire’s annual meeting in its hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. In his annual letter to shareholders on March 1, Buffett described Iscar as one of Berkshire’s five most profitable companies outside its insurance businesses. While Berkshire does not break out Iscar results separately, it said the Tefen, Israel-based unit’s profit fell in 2012 because of slowing economic conditions in some non-U.S. markets. A year ago, Buffett in his shareholder letter described Iscar’s management as “brilliant strategists and operators.” Iscar ended 2012 with more than 11,900 employees. The Wertheimers’ sale of an 80 percent Iscar stake in 2006, announced one day before Berkshire’s annual meeting that year, made the family among the richest in Israel. Stef Wertheimer, who is German-born and founded Iscar in 1952, has established a number of industrial parks in Israel aimed at promoting peace by having Jews and Arabs work together. The law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz advised the Wertheimer family on the Iscar transaction. The law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson advised Berkshire.

444,BRKa,Warren Buffett calls for America's men to boost women in business,"(Reuters) - The key to America’s future success lies in helping women achieve as much as their male counterparts, billionaire investor Warren Buffett said in an essay published on Thursday that echoes a recent debate about gender roles in Corporate America. Buffett - whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) was recently described as the least diverse big company in America - took to the pages of Fortune magazine to argue that not only was helping women do well in the workplace the ethical thing to do, it was also in a man’s self-interest. “Fellow males, get onboard. The closer that America comes to fully employing the talents of all its citizens, the greater its output of goods and services will be,” Buffett wrote. The question of women and their success in business became a hot-button topic earlier this year after Facebook (FB.O) Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg wrote “Lean In”, a book challenging male leaders to mentor more women. Buffett’s essay expands upon the theme. “Too many women continue to impose limitations on themselves, talking themselves out of achieving their potential,” Buffett wrote. As an example he cited Katharine Graham, the late Washington Post WPO.N CEO who he said never conquered her self-doubt. He also made the industrial case for boosting women in the workplace, noting their productivity was being underutilized. “If obvious benefits flow from helping the male component of the workforce achieve its potential, why in the world wouldn’t you want to include its counterpart?” he asked. The essay comes just two days before Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting, where the company will ask investors to elect New York investor Meryl Witmer to the board, making her the third woman of 13 board members. Berkshire moved to add Witmer to the board in early March, around the same time that Calvert Investments released a report on diversity practices among S&P; 100 companies. Calvert said Buffett’s conglomerate ranked lowest among the group. Berkshire has not commented to date on the report.

446,BRKa,"Kass, Berkshire's Bear, is ready to 'surprise' Buffett","(Reuters) - Hedge fund trader Doug Kass had his first brush with fame at the age of 10, when he appeared on a U.S. television quiz show, Tic-Tac-Dough, and won every day for a week. More than five decades later, Kass might find another sort of celebrity this Saturday when he will have the opportunity to quiz billionaire investor Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. Buffett in March handpicked Kass, founder of hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management Inc, to be Berkshire’s first “credentialed bear” to attend the meeting, and “spice things up.” Kass, 64, has shorted Berkshire stock in a bet the price will fall. He is one of three members of an analyst panel that, along with shareholders and journalists, gets to question Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger for five hours at the meeting, which draws more than 35,000 people to Omaha each year. “I had a lot of fun going to the Woodstock music festival on Max Yasgur’s farm in Bethel, New York in August 1969. I expect to have almost as much fun - and remember it - going to the Woodstock of Capitalism in Omaha,” Kass said in an interview. He declined to disclose the size of his Berkshire short, but called it an “average-sized position” that he initiated only a few days before Buffett’s invitation. Kass is known for his maverick positions, and his stock picks and pans have been followed widely by virtue of his prolific writings for TheStreet.com. He has a column - at one time called “The Contrarian” - to discuss neglected or undervalued stocks and sectors that he calls “purchase candidates,” as well as fully exploited or overvalued investments that he thinks are worth selling short. In April, Kass told clients and readers that he was bearish on economic growth and stocks. “I maintain an out-of-consensus view that a recession in the U.S. by 2014 holds about a 50 percent probability,” said Kass, who added that he was shorting equities. Kass grew up in Long Island, New York and says he learned the stock market from his grandmother. “My Grandma Koufax taught me the stock market when I was 15 years old,” he said. “I spent my vacations as a teenager ‘watching the tape’ in a small brokerage firm in Rockville Centre, Long Island. I bought my first stock, Teledyne, in 1967.” His childhood nickname was “The Professor” because he had top grades in school. After majoring in philosophy and religion at Alfred University, while avidly participating in the 1970s “make love not war” peace movement, Kass took his first job working with American political activist Ralph Nader. Kass began his investment career as a housing analyst at the investment bank Kidder Peabody in 1972. He later worked for the billionaire investor Leon Cooperman, who runs the hedge fund Omega Advisors. Kass founded Seabreeze in 1997. “He’s bright, thoughtful, analytical - and maybe he tends to the dark side a little bit too much,” Cooperman said in a telephone interview. “At times the consensus is right, at times the consensus is wrong. And I think he relishes being out of consensus.” Kass said the toughest criticism he ever faced as a short-seller was in late 1999, when he trashed Time Warner’s $112.1 billion merger with AOL. He called it overpriced, with “no synergies between the two companies and weak earnings prospects. “There were a lot of nasty emails and (institutional investors) were interviewed and attacked my position” in the press, Kass recalled. He was proven right. The merger never met expectations, and the combined company’s stock price sank from $65 into the single digits. Time Warner Inc TWX.N spun off AOL Inc AOL.N in 2009, a transaction valuing the latter at less than $3 billion. “It is widely regarded as a seminal deal at the end of the Internet boom and a huge mistake - perhaps one of the worst M&A; deals in history,” Kass said. He has also had his share of wrong calls. Kass said his worst short bet was against Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) shares 15 years ago. “It was a bad, bad loss,” he said, but did not give details. Kass has also this year bet against U.S. Treasuries, considering it “the trade of the decade.” But it hasn’t worked out so far, as 10-year Treasury yields have plunged amid concerns about global economic growth, falling below 1.65 percent this week from over 2 percent in mid-March. Since being chosen as Berkshire’s bear in March, Kass says he has not communicated with Buffett or Munger, and he does not want to give them any hints on what issues he plans to raise. “I want it to be a surprise and I don’t want Mr. Buffett to consider the questions until the meeting,” Kass said. He has previously raised red flags over Berkshire’s large size and Buffett’s advanced age of 82, saying it will be difficult to replace “the single greatest stock investor of all time.” Kass said he is not nervous about challenging Buffett in front of his most ardent supporters, but said this weekend could prove “the craziest thing” he has ever done. He will certainly be better prepared than he was for one question on Tic-Tac-Dough. Kass recalls one live broadcast where he was asked to name the holiday that falls on the Sunday before Easter, and was given a hint by host Jack Barry that it was the name of a tree. “Dogwood Sunday,” Kass answered. “Doug, I am sorry,” Barry replied, according to Kass. “The correct answer is Palm Sunday.

Time Warner Inc spun off AOL Inc in 2009, a transaction valuing the latter at less than $3 billion. “It is widely regarded as a seminal deal at the end of the Internet boom and a huge mistake - perhaps one of the worst M&A; deals in history,” Kass said. He has also had his share of wrong calls. Kass said his worst short bet was against Amazon.com Inc shares 15 years ago. “It was a bad, bad loss,” he said, but did not give details. Kass has also this year bet against U.S. Treasuries, considering it “the trade of the decade.” But it hasn’t worked out so far, as 10-year Treasury yields have plunged amid concerns about global economic growth, falling below 1.65 percent this week from over 2 percent in mid-March. Since being chosen as Berkshire’s bear in March, Kass says he has not communicated with Buffett or Munger, and he does not want to give them any hints on what issues he plans to raise. “I want it to be a surprise and I don’t want Mr. Buffett to consider the questions until the meeting,” Kass said. He has previously raised red flags over Berkshire’s large size and Buffett’s advanced age of 82, saying it will be difficult to replace “the single greatest stock investor of all time.” Kass said he is not nervous about challenging Buffett in front of his most ardent supporters, but said this weekend could prove “the craziest thing” he has ever done. He will certainly be better prepared than he was for one question on Tic-Tac-Dough. Kass recalls one live broadcast where he was asked to name the holiday that falls on the Sunday before Easter, and was given a hint by host Jack Barry that it was the name of a tree. “Dogwood Sunday,” Kass answered. “Doug, I am sorry,” Barry replied, according to Kass. “The correct answer is Palm Sunday. Haven’t you ever heard of Palm Sunday? “No, Mr. Barry. I never heard of Palm Sunday. I am Jewish.” Barry, who was also Jewish, fell over laughing into a nearby pyramid of Crest toothpaste boxes set up for a commercial.",5022013,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-buffett-kass-shortseller-newsm/newsmaker-kass-berkshires-bear-is-ready-to-surprise-buffett-idUSL2N0DH32220130502

The results topped expectations and were released after Berkshire shares closed at a record high. Berkshire’s more than 80 businesses are benefiting from a strengthening economy, as illustrated by increased traffic on its Burlington Northern railroad unit, new customers for its McLane food distribution business, and stepped-up demand for its Forest River recreational vehicles, to name just a few. Profit from insurance operations, including the Geico car insurance unit and a business that provides protection against major catastrophes, roughly doubled. “The happy fact right now is that the growth areas in the economy are right in Berkshire’s wheelhouse,” said Jeff Matthews, founder of the RAM Partners LP hedge fund and author of “Pilgrimage to Warren Buffett’s Omaha.” Berkshire released its results a day before Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger will field five hours of shareholder questions at the company’s annual meeting in its hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. Net income increased to $4.89 billion, or $2,977 per Class A share, from $3.25 billion, or $1,966 per share, a year earlier. Quarterly operating profit rose 42 percent to $3.78 billion, or $2,302 per share, from $2.67 billion, or $1,615 per share. Analysts on average expected profit of $1,996 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Book value per share, Buffett’s preferred measure of growth, increased 5.5 percent from year end to $120,525 per Class A share, and Berkshire’s cash stake grew over that period to $49.09 billion from $46.99 billion. About $12.1 billion is being used to fund a purchase by Berkshire and Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital of ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co. Revenue rose 15 percent from a year ago to $43.87 billion. Operating profit from insurance operations rose to $1.7 billion from $845 million. Nearly all the improvement came from underwriting, where profit rose to $901 million from $54 million, in part because of a $255 million pre-tax reinsurance gain, as well as currency fluctuations. Underwriting profit at Geico more than doubled. “The backbone of Berkshire is its world class collection of insurance companies,” said David Rolfe, chief investment officer at Wedgewood Partners Inc, which invests 6.5 percent of its $4 billion of assets in Berkshire stock. Operating profit from noninsurance business rose 12 percent to $2.25 billion. This included increases of 14 percent at Burlington Northern to $798 million, and a little over 10 percent from manufacturing, service and retail operations to $944 million. Profit generated by MidAmerican Energy, a utility unit that Berkshire owns most of, rose 17 percent to $394 million. Investment and derivatives gains nearly doubled to $1.11 billion, in part because of gains related to Berkshire’s warrants for General Electric Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc . Berkshire also owns tens of billions of dollars of common stocks such as Coca-Cola Co, International Business Machines Corp and Wells Fargo & Co. Gains from derivatives increased 20 percent before taxes, mainly because of Berkshire’s long-term contracts related to performance in stock indexes such as the Standard & Poor’s 500, which rose 10 percent in the first quarter. Investors are used to that volatility, and Berkshire accepts it as part of its focus on the long term. “If we cope well every day with what’s on our desk, the future will take care of itself,” Munger said in an interview on Friday.

451,BRKa,"Munger: hard to find Berkshire deals, 'raving mad' not to try","OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc would be “stark raving mad” to rule out another giant acquisition like its 2009 Burlington Northern takeover, but high prices have now made attractive targets scarce, its vice chairman said on Friday. In an interview with Reuters on the eve of Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting, Charlie Munger said the company has over the years made many of its most desirable purchases in periods of “great catastrophes,” but little appears on the horizon at present. “With interest rates at zero, the prices being paid for businesses are very high,” Berkshire’s second-in-command said. Munger said Berkshire would welcome another purchase on the scale of its $26.5 billion takeover of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp in 2009. “Everybody would like it,” he said. “But just because you like it doesn’t mean that the world will necessarily give it to you. You’d be stark raving mad if you were running Berkshire and didn’t want another Burlington Northern. But how many Burlington Northerns have we done in 50 years?” The Federal Reserve’s “quantitative easing” policy known as QE3 to juice the fragile U.S. economic recovery has sent yields declining and asset prices rising including housing and commercial real estate markets. “Sometimes the macro economic tide is working for us - and sometimes against - and we just endure whatever direction it’s flowing cheerfully,” Munger said. “So we are not people who think know all the answers about predicting macro economic fluctuations.” The views of Munger, 89, usually mirror those of 82-year-old Buffett, who is perhaps the world’s best-known and most influential value investor. The pair have worked together for decades in delivering consistently handsome returns for its shareholders. As such, Berkshire carries enormous clout within investor circles when it tips its hand about a specific company or a particular industry. Munger’s comments suggest that investors who have been waiting eagerly for Buffett to use his “elephant gun” again to add another large company to his portfolio may have to wait. The issue is expected to be a hot topic at this weekend’s meeting, held every year in Buffett’s hometown of Omaha. The meeting and related events - what Buffett likes to call “Woodstock for Capitalists” - usually draw 35,000 people to the city. The main attraction is always a marathon, five-hour session in which Buffett and Munger field questions from shareholders, journalists and analysts. NO PLAN TO ‘OUT-APPLE’ APPLE Berkshire, which owns more than 80 businesses in such fields as car insurance, chemicals, energy and retail, could use the meeting this weekend to signal the direction it will take in the coming year. Munger on Friday gave no indication that technology was likely to be a focus. Despite a recent large investment in International Business Machines Corp, the company has long been underweight in technology companies such as Apple Inc, in which it has no reported stake. When asked if Berkshire may consider an investment in Apple, especially now that Apple’s share price has tumbled in recent months, Munger said: “The whole world admires the achievements of Apple. On the other hand, you could hardly think of another business that is more un-Berkshire-like than Apple.” “We really hate trying to invent whole new, novel technologies, one after another. We wouldn’t be as good at it as Apple is. So we’re not trying to out-Apple Apple.” Berkshire prefers larger, easy-to-understand businesses with consistent earnings power, good returns on equity and strong management. The recent $12 billion investment that Berkshire agreed to make in H.J. Heinz Co, part of a $23.2 billion takeover, differs from most of its acquisitions because it will not have much say in how the ketchup maker is run. Munger, though, said such an arrangement is not unprecedented for Berkshire. “We did more or less exactly the same thing when we helped the Mars family buy Wrigley,” he said, referring to the $23 billion takeover of the chewing gum company, announced in 2008. “So this is not something new for Berkshire. This is the second time we’ve done something like this - it’s just a different partner. I wish we had a third one to do tomorrow.” Buying and investing in solid businesses have helped Berkshire outperform other companies during down periods for the economy, including 2002 and the deep recession in 2008 and 2009, Buffett has said. Munger said the stimuli provided to the economy after the financial crisis was necessary, but said it is unclear how best to unwind it, including the Federal Reserve’s “quantitative easing” policy known as QE3. He called the bi-partisan response to the Great Recession “intense and extreme and it should have been.” He added: “But now, knowing exactly when we should stop and how we get off the back of the tiger, I think everyone is a little confused including the people in charge.” Uncertainty also prevails outside the United States, but Munger said Berkshire takes it in stride. He pointed to Berkshire’s recently completed purchase of all of Israeli metalworking company Iscar, and its investment in shares of South Korean steelmaker Posco. “Just as Berkshire was going to buy in Israel with Iscar, we are willing to own a little stock in Posco right across from North Korea. We have enough favorable factors going for us. We’re willing to endure whatever extra risk there is.” ",5032013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-agm-munger/munger-hard-to-find-berkshire-deals-raving-mad-not-to-try-idUSBRE9420PM20130503
452,BRKa,"No tweets for me, Buffett's second-in-command says","OMAHA, Neb., May 3 (Reuters) - So they are not completely in sync after all. A day after Berkshire Hathaway Inc Chairman Warren Buffett set up his own account on Twitter, his second-in-command, Charlie Munger, said he has no plans to follow the legendary investor’s lead. Buffett, 82, launched his “@WarrenBuffett” account with the tweet “Warren is in the house,” and immediately started adding followers at the rate of 1,000 per minute. But the 89-year-old Munger - renowned for his forthright style of speaking - suggested fans should not look forward to seeing his trademark remarks in 140-character form any time soon. “No, certainly not,” Munger said in an interview, after being asked whether he planned to join the social media network. “That’s not my milieu. I don’t like too many things going on at once.” It marks a rare point of departure between Buffett and Munger, who have worked together at Berkshire for decades. “We have practically no disagreements. That’s just the way the chemistry has worked,” Munger said, commenting on his working relationship with Buffett. “People who think we’re quite a diverse pair, and that one is helping the other - it’s more like two twins, and one of them is a little more able than the other.” Berkshire Hathaway will hold its annual shareholder meeting on Saturday in Omaha.

He said that he “may have added a little bit” to Berkshire’s stake in the company in the first quarter.

455,BRKa,Buffett maps out hopes for Berkshire without him,"OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday gave the most extensive comments to date about the future of Berkshire Hathaway Inc after he is gone, saying he still expects the conglomerate to be a partner of choice for distressed companies. Buffett, 82, also defended his plan to install his son, Howard, who has little investing experience, as nonexecutive chairman, saying the younger man’s role would be to ensure that Berkshire had the right CEO in place. During the financial crisis and its immediate aftermath, Berkshire helped prop up a number of companies, among them blue-chips such as General Electric and Goldman Sachs. Buffett’s investments were viewed by many shareholders as a seal of approval from one of the world’s most respected businessmen. Short-seller Doug Kass, invited by Buffett to Berkshire’s annual meeting on Saturday to offer contrarian points of view, asked whether a successor would have the same heft. Buffett said it would not matter. “Berkshire is the 800 number when there is really some panic in the markets, and people really need significant capital,” Buffett said. “If you come to a day when the Dow has fallen 1,000 points a day for a few days and the tide has gone out and you find some naked swimmers, those naked swimmers ... will call Berkshire,” he added. Whoever ultimately takes over Berkshire will run a conglomerate that employs more than 280,000 people in dozens of businesses worldwide, covering everything from ice cream to insurance and retail to railroads. Kass later asked what qualified Howard Buffett, a 58-year-old farmer and philanthropist, to step in as Berkshire’s non-executive chairman when his father is gone. The elder Buffett insisted his son was ideal for the task at hand. “He has no illusions at all of running the business. He won’t get paid for running the business,” Warren Buffett said. “He’ll only have to think about whether the board ... needs to change the CEO.” As in the past, Buffett talked about his successor as CEO without actually identifying him. Speculation usually focuses on a small group of top Berkshire executives, among them insurance boss Ajit Jain and railroad leader Matt Rose. One long-time Buffett-watcher said the legendary investor seemed to handle the pressure from Kass and others well. “Buffett hasn’t broken much new ground, but he’s handled Doug’s question well ... and, as always, reinforced the Berkshire culture every chance he’s had,” said Jeff Matthews, founder of hedge fund Ram Partners LP and a Buffett biographer. Berkshire’s breadth means that its performance is seen as a barometer for the broader economy. On Saturday, Buffett said he still stands by the actions taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy, even as he cautioned that the program could be “very inflationary.” “This is like watching a good movie, and I do not know the end,” he said. “We have benefited significantly, and the country has benefited significantly, by what the Fed has done.” Buffett also endorsed the last four years of deficit spending by President Barack Obama’s administration, saying it is a problem to get off that program but much less of a problem than if the government had followed a strict austerity program instead. “We are seeing some recovery in housing prices which has psychological effects,” he said. “(By the next annual meeting) I think we will have moved forward ... I don’t think there will be a surge of any sort, but I don’t think we will stall.” Earlier Saturday, one of Buffett’s top lieutenants said things were picking up but could improve further. “It feels like a 2 percent economy. If we want to see GDP click up to 3.5 percent, 4 percent, you need to see more consumption,” said Rose, CEO of the railroad Burlington Northern, in an interview. Rose said Burlington Northern was seeing “across the board” increases in demand to ship things like concrete, roofing tiles and cars. Buffett may be optimistic about the economy, but he is decidedly more cautious about technology. Earlier this week he joined Twitter, taking the handle @WarrenBuffett - but insisted he only knew enough about it to press a button when told to. On Saturday he said he disagreed with the recent guidance from the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission that lets companies release material information on Twitter. Some see that as a threat to Berkshire’s press release service, Business Wire. “The key to disclosure is accuracy and simultaneity ... I do not want it, if I am buying Wells Fargo, to keep hitting up their web page and hoping I’m not 10 seconds behind someone else for some important announcement,” he said. He also stuck by one of Berkshire’s more controversial investments, its recent acquisition of a number of newspapers. The annual meeting crowd applauded when CNBC anchor Andrew Ross Sorkin asked a critical question about the stable of papers. “It’s not going to move the needle in Berkshire ... we are buying the papers at very, very low prices with (regard to) current earnings,” Buffett said, adding that he expected to meet or beat a 10 percent rate of return, after-tax. Yet as much as investors want to hear about Berkshire’s growth potential and the state of the economy, some also attend the meeting just for a good laugh. The meeting opened, as it does every year, with a video montage. This year’s included a duet between Buffett and singer Jon Bon Jovi and a take-off on the TV series “Breaking Bad.” Some of the best comedy, though, usually comes in the verbal sparring between Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger over the course of the day.

Following are selected comments by Buffett, Vice Chairman Charlie Munger and other Berkshire executives on a broad range of topics: BUFFETT ON HIS SON HOWARD’S QUALIFICATIONS TO BE NONEXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN AFTER THE ELDER BUFFETT IS NO LONGER RUNNING THE FIRM: Buffet says Howard is taking the role “in case a mistake is made” in choosing a CEO, the odds of which are “less than 1 in 100. “He has no illusions at all of running the business.

He won’t get paid for running the business. “He’ll only have to think about whether the board ... needs to change the CEO. ...

463,BRKa,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Buffett says he, Berkshire board in agreement on next CEO","(Corrects word in quote by Burlington Northern CEO to “consumption” instead of “construction” in 7th graph) * Does not name successor, in keeping with practice * One candidate says economy picking up * Annual meeting opens with Buffett-Bon Jovi duet By Jonathan Stempel and Jennifer Ablan OMAHA, Neb., May 4 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett and the board of his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc  are “solidly in agreement” on who should be the company’s next chief executive, he said at Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting on Saturday. But Buffett, as with past practice, did not actually name his successor as CEO. Speculation usually focuses on a small group of top Berkshire executives, among them insurance boss Ajit Jain and railroad leader Matt Rose. The 82-year-old Buffett, in response to a shareholder question, said he thinks all the time about what could go wrong at Berkshire after he is gone. “The key is preserving a culture and having a successor, a CEO that will have more brains, more energy, more passion for it than even I have ...  We’re solidly in agreement as to who that individual should be,” Buffett said. Whoever ultimately takes over Berkshire will run a conglomerate that employs more than a quarter-million people in dozens of businesses worldwide, covering everything from ice cream to insurance and retail to railroads. Its breadth means that its performance is often seen as a barometer for the broader economy. Earlier Saturday, one of Buffett’s top lieutenants said things were picking up but could improve further. “It feels like a 2 percent economy. If we want to see GDP  click up to 3.5 percent, 4 percent, you need to see more consumption,” said Rose, CEO of the railroad Burlington Northern, in an interview. Rose said BNSF was seeing “across the board” increases in demand to ship things like concrete, roofing tiles and cars. But as much as investors want to hear about Berkshire’s growth potential and the state of the economy, some also attend the meeting just for a good laugh. The meeting opened, as it does every year, with a video montage. This year’s included a duet between Buffett and singer Jon Bon Jovi and a take-off on the TV series “Breaking Bad.” Some of the best comedy, though, usually comes in the verbal sparring between Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger over the course of the day. The two are close - they usually share an oversize box of peanut brittle during the meeting - but Munger’s acerbic tongue pops out from time to time. “I come to see Charlie Munger needle Warren Buffett - only he can,” said Sherman Silber, a doctor and shareholder.

465,BRKa,Buffett devotees stick by him even as growth slows,"OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - Short-seller Douglas Kass, Warren Buffett’s handpicked bear, raised a concern on the minds of many shareholders at the “Woodstock for capitalists” this weekend: Has Berkshire Hathaway Inc become so big that it will find it hard to grow? Many retail investors who converged on Omaha, Nebraska, for Berkshire’s annual meeting on Saturday acknowledged that its fastest growth days are likely behind it. But they said Berkshire is still a good long-term bet as faith remains in Buffett and his management team’s more than 4-decade-long record of stellar returns, and the company’s tentacles into many sectors of the U.S. economy. “Yes, it is a concern, but I have to get my expectations in line,” said Julie Fehrnstrom, a mother of three from Orinda, California, attending her fifth meeting. “They are not driven by short-term decision making and they have really smart management. You really don’t always find that.” Sherrie Palmer, a social worker from Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, was attending her first Berkshire meeting, one of 35,000 or so investors. “The steepness of the growth is leveling off, but it’s not a concern,” Palmer said. “We like the manner in which decisions are made and I don’t worry about this being an organization jumping to a fad that won’t pan out.” Patience has served Berkshire shareholders well. Investing in companies with dependable businesses and sound management has helped Berkshire as an investment trounce major competitors since Buffett took it over in 1965. Berkshire is now one of the largest U.S. companies by market value, with more than 288,000 employees in dozens of businesses, covering everything from ice cream to underwear and insurance to railroads. But its massive size - currently around $268 billion in market value - has made it hard for Berkshire to grow as fast as it once did. While Berkshire performs well in down markets, it can lag in rising markets. Buffett reminded shareholders that 2009-2013 may prove to be the first five-year period ever when the company’s growth in book value per share will lag the Standard & Poor’s 500 index including dividends. “People who buy stocks now and hold stocks for 20 years will make money,” Buffett told Reuters Insider in an interview on Saturday evening. “Those who hold for 20 days, I don’t know what will happen.” It has also become harder for the company to find deals that are large enough to move the needle. In February, Berkshire, along with Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital, struck a deal to buy ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co, and Buffett said he was looking for more big acquisitions. But in an interview on Friday, Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger said high prices have made attractive deals scarce. “With interest rates at zero, the prices being paid for businesses are very high,” Berkshire’s second-in-command said. Still, size has advantages. Berkshire’s quarterly profit rose nearly 51 percent on solid performance in insurance and many of its other units. The results showed that its more than 80 businesses are benefiting from a strengthening economy, as illustrated by increased traffic on its Burlington Northern railroad unit, new customers for its McLane food distribution business and stepped-up demand for its Forest River recreational vehicles, to name just a few. “In the 1990s, Warren was criticized for not being ‘state of the art,’” said Arthur Cohen, a financial adviser from Highland Park, Illinois, who was attending his 15th meeting. “I’m not critical of his performance since.” Investors have also worried about what will happen to Berkshire after Buffett, 82, and Munger, 89, leave. In his most extensive comments to date about the future of Berkshire after he is gone, Buffett said he still expects the conglomerate to be a partner of choice for distressed companies. Buffett said he and his board are “solidly in agreement” on who should be the next chief executive - but offered no names - and said his son, Howard, would become chairman to ensure that Berkshire had the right CEO in place. “The key is preserving a culture and having a successor, a CEO that will have more brains, more energy, more passion for it than even I have,” Buffett said in response to a shareholder question at the meeting. As Berkshire has grown, so has the yearly extravaganza, now Omaha’s second-biggest annual tourism event behind the College World Series baseball tournament. The event attracted many well-known investors, including Mario Gabelli, Leon Cooperman and Chris Davis, as well as mom-and-pop investors. Missy Krasso, a driver for Happy Cab in Omaha, makes as much as $3,000 in fares during the Berkshire weekend. Wall Street tips well, she said. Before the meeting began, Buffett roamed an exhibit hall at the arena featuring Berkshire-owned companies. Cherry Coke in hand, he dipped coconut bon-bons in a fondant coating at See’s Candies, admired a model Burlington Northern railroad and tossed newspapers. Berkshire owns the Omaha World-Herald and others. A new addition to the series of events around the meeting this year was an “Invest in Yourself” five-kilometer run through downtown Omaha, with Buffett starting it off, if not necessarily setting the pace. The real mad sprint began at 6:30 a.m. on Saturday, when dozens of shareholders rushed for the best seats directly in front of Buffett and Munger on the arena floor, large enough to be suitable for a rock-star concert. Sherman Silber, a fertility doctor who has attended the meetings for 15 years, said he misses the “old format” where he could just go to the podium and ask a question. “Now you have to do all this lottery stuff,” he said. But Rosie Smith, a finance executive for a Baltimore book printer, said she keeps coming back for more. “We came out here, and it was the wildest thing we’ve ever seen,” she said, referring to the first of her 10 visits to the meeting. “Every year, it keeps snowballing.” ",5052013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-agm/buffett-devotees-stick-by-him-even-as-growth-slows-idUSBRE94307H20130505

But Rosie Smith, a finance executive for a Baltimore book printer, said she keeps coming back for more. “We came out here, and it was the wildest thing we’ve ever seen,” she said, referring to the first of her 10 visits to the meeting. “Every year, it keeps snowballing.”",5052013,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-agm/update-1-buffett-devotees-stick-by-him-even-as-growth-slows-idUSL2N0DM01620130505

471,BRKa,"UPDATE 2-Buffett says economy on mend, bonds 'terrible' investment","* Buffett says economy moving forward at ‘slow pace’ * Buffett says JPMorgan CEO Dimon should stay chairman * Buffett praises Bernanke as ‘gutsy guy’ By Jonathan Stempel May 6 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett said the U.S. economy is gradually improving, but low interest rates have made bonds “terrible investments” while stocks remain “reasonably priced.” Speaking on CNBC television on Monday, the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc  said the economy is benefiting from an upturn in areas that had not previously performed well, particularly homebuilding. He also said the rebound is helping create increased traffic for Berkshire’s private plane unit NetJets, and could result in a record profit this year for Berkshire’s railroad unit Burlington Northern Santa Fe. “The economy is moving forward, but at a slow pace,” he said. “Demand has come back, but slowly.” Buffett spoke on CNBC after Berkshire’s annual shareholders meeting over the weekend in Omaha, Nebraska. The world’s fourth-richest person said low benchmark interest rates, including overnight rates that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has kept at effectively zero since late 2008, can help stimulate demand. But many investors have also been drawn to bonds because their prices rise as rates fall, and Buffett said they could get their comeuppance when that process reverses. “Bonds, they’re terrible investments now,” Buffett said. “That will change at some point, and when it changes, people could lose a lot of money if they’re in long-term bonds.” He said stocks, in contrast, are “reasonably priced,” though he continues to shy away from sectors such as media, where he cannot reasonably predict who will thrive in the long run. “It’s a lot easier for me to predict that ketchup will be doing well or Coca-Cola will be doing well in 10 years,” Buffett said, referring to Berkshire’s pending takeover with Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital of H.J. Heinz Co, and Berkshire’s large investment in Coca-Cola Co stock. Berkshire ended March with $95.9 billion of equities and $31.4 billion of fixed-income securities on its balance sheet. At the annual meeting, Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger agreed that the economic stimulus provided by Washington during the 2008 financial crisis was needed to address what Buffett called “the greatest panic in my lifetime.” Speaking on Monday, Buffett called Bernanke “a gutsy guy” who has “done very, very well in terms of what he has done for the United States.” Last week, the Fed said it would continue to buy $85 billion of bonds per month to spur growth, and it will step up purchases if needed. The economy grew at a 2.5 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. Buffett also said Jamie Dimon should remain chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co, after ISS Proxy Advisory Services urged that the roles be split and that three directors not be re-elected because of poor oversight. Dimon and the bank have been faulted for a lack of oversight that last year led to more than $6 billion of trading losses. Buffett personally invests in JPMorgan but Berkshire does not. “I think it’s fine if he does” retain both roles, Buffett said, referring to Dimon. “If you’re the director of a company like JPMorgan, you cannot know the details of what’s going on with trading ... They’ve got the right CEO.” Berkshire does plan after Buffett leaves to split the roles, with his son Howard becoming non-executive chairman. Buffett said splitting or not splitting the roles are both acceptable. Many investors believe three top Berkshire managers - insurance chief Ajit Jain, Burlington Northern’s Matthew Rose and MidAmerican Energy’s Greg Abel - are the men to whom Buffett has alluded as being candidates to become Berkshire’s CEO. Asked if it was a coincidence that they sat near the stage on Saturday, Buffett said: “Certainly could be,” before adding that he asked them to sit there in case there were questions for them to answer. Buffett also said it will be “very tough” for J.C. Penney & Co to lure back many of the customers it lost in 2012 and early 2013 as the now-ousted Chief Executive Ron Johnson overhauled the retailer’s stores and sales strategies. “They obviously alienated a significant part of their customer base,” Buffett said. While Berkshire does not invest in J.C. Penney, Buffett said he had a “rooting interest for them.”",5062013,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-buffett/update-2-buffett-says-economy-on-mend-bonds-terrible-investment-idUSL2N0DN0A020130506

According to a regulatory filing, the companies on Tuesday entered a “standstill” agreement, which is often used to prevent unsolicited takeovers, indicating the maximum percentage of shares that Berkshire can own. DaVita shares rose $3.84, or 3.3 percent, to $121.40 in after-hours trading after the agreement was disclosed. Berkshire owned about 15 million DaVita shares, or 14.2 percent, as of March 4, according to another regulatory filing. These shares were worth about $1.76 billion, based on Tuesday’s closing price of $117.56 for DaVita. That price gave DaVita a market value of about $12.4 billion.

475,BRKa,New book teaches children ABCs of Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway,"OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc invests in dozens of businesses, and a new book tries to explain it all to young readers, from A to Z. Two Omaha residents, author Nancy Rips and illustrator Tom Kerr, have teamed up on “My First Berkshire ABC” to teach children about one of the world’s best-known companies, and a little about the local billionaire behind it. More than 1,000 copies were sold at Berkshire’s annual meeting on Saturday, which draws thousands of people to Omaha, and where Buffett has a say on what gets sold. “You need something to bring home to your kids and grandkids to explain Berkshire,” Rips, who has also written three books about Jewish holidays, said in a joint interview with Kerr. Most pages show companies that Berkshire owns or invests in. G, for example, is for “Geico,” and features the car insurer’s talking gecko. And W is for “Wells Fargo”, and features the bank’s familiar stagecoach. The book’s theme changed at Buffett’s suggestion. “Our first effort was things like, ‘S is for sharing. Mr. Buffett believes in sharing. K is for being kind,’” Rips said. “I got an email back from Warren saying, it’s too laudatory, they will lampoon him in the news,” she continued. “And I wrote a whole new proposal: A is for Acme (Brick), B is for Borsheim’s (jewelry), C is for Clayton Homes, D is for Dairy Queen. I got an email back: ‘You’re in the show.’” Kerr has worked at many newspapers and drew McGruff, the Crime Dog for the National Crime Prevention Council. “Part of what Warren talks about is investing in things that you know,” he said. “Virtually everything in here is something that somebody can relate to and touch and understand.” Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger is shown under “Q,” stamping boxes of “quality” merchandise. Rips and Kerr have not heard from Buffett on whether he likes the book. Buffett’s assistant Carrie Sova had no comment on that question. Kerr depicted Buffett just four times, including on the cover holding his usual Cherry Coke. “This book is not all about Warren Buffett,” Kerr said. “I picked my spots. He’s so synonymous with Dairy Queen that I wanted him there, and obviously on the cover with Coca-Cola.” “Cherry Coke,” Rips interjected. “Yep,” Kerr said. “She had me change that.” ",5082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-buffett-book/new-book-teaches-children-abcs-of-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-idUSBRE9470L920130508
476,BRKa,Fitch Rates Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation's Senior Debt Issue 'A+',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO/BOGOTA, May 10 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned 'A+' ratings to the $1  billion of senior unsecured notes issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corp.  (BHFC). The notes are guaranteed by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK). The  'A+' ratings are equivalent to Fitch's ratings on BHFC's outstanding senior  unsecured notes that are guaranteed by BRK.  The issuance of senior unsecured notes consisted of the following: $500 million,  1.3% coupon, maturing in 2018 and $500 million, 4.3% coupon, maturing in 2043.  Proceeds from the senior notes are to be used to redeem notes maturing this  month.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's ratings on BRK are supported by extremely strong capitalization and  market position of its insurance subsidiaries, solid operating performance with  good diversification across business lines and excellent financial flexibility  and liquidity.  Also considered in the ratings are material risk exposures related to an above  average investment allocation to common stocks, a substantial position in equity  derivatives, insured natural catastrophe exposures and various issues associated  with the company's acquisition strategy and succession planning. BRK's consolidated financial leverage was 24% of total capital as of March 31,  2013. Consolidated interest coverage for the first three months of 2013 was  greater than 10x excluding realized investment gains. Both financial leverage  and interest coverage ratios are not expected to change meaningfully given the  modest size of the issuance relative to total capitalization and since proceeds  will be used to pay maturing debt.  BRK's debt-to-total capital and debt-to-tangible capital ratios at the holding  company level (including debt issued by the company's finance company  subsidiaries and guaranteed by BRK) were 17% and 22%, respectively at March 31,  2013. Fitch views BRK's ability to fund finance operations at a low cost as an  important competitive advantage for the finance operations and also notes that  much of the finance company debt is guaranteed by BRK. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to a future downgrade include: --Deterioration in the credit quality of key insurance subsidiaries (National  Indemnity, GenRe, and GEICO) that is no longer consistent with the current 'AA+'  rating. Measures of credit quality include Fitch's judgment of capitalization, a  total financing and commitments ratio greater than 1.5x, net leverage (excluding  affiliated investments) over 3.5x or a sharp and persistent reduction in  underwriting profits;  --A run-rate debt-to-tangible capital ratio from the holding company, insurance  and finance operations (including debt issued or guaranteed by the holding  company) that exceeds 30%; --Material increases in leveraged equity market exposure such as its equity  index put derivative portfolio;  --Acquisitions or other actions that reduce outstanding cash below $10 billion  or approximately 5x consolidated interest expense.   Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: --A commitment to lower debt-to-tangible capital ratios attributed to the  holding company, insurance and finance operations. Fitch believes that this  would likely require the scaling back of the finance operations.

477,BRKa,"Berkshire reveals CB&I; stake, adds to Wells Fargo","(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Wednesday revealed a new investment in Chicago Bridge & Iron Co and said it has added to its largest equity holding, Wells Fargo & Co. The changes were disclosed in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing detailing Berkshire’s $85 billion of equity investments listed on U.S. exchanges as of March 31. Earlier this month, Berkshire said it had $95.9 billion of equity securities overall, and Buffett indicated that the bulk of the company’s investments will stay in the United States. “If you told us we could only invest in the United States for the rest of our lives, we wouldn’t regard this as a huge hardship,” Buffett said on May 4 at Berkshire’s annual meeting in its hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. The company also owns more than 80 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, utilities, chemicals, apparel and food. Berkshire said it has taken a roughly 6.51 million-share stake in CB&I;, one of the largest U.S.-listed engineering companies. The stake was worth about $404.2 million as of March 31. Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire discloses new investments, and CBI shares rose 3.4 percent to $59.75 in after-hours trading. They had closed down 14 cents at $57.76. Berkshire also boosted its stake in Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, by about 4 percent from year end to 458.2 million shares. Those shares were worth about $16.95 billion on March 31, roughly the current market value of high-end clothing retailer Ralph Lauren Corp. Berkshire’s top four equity holdings - Wells Fargo, American Express Co, Coca-Cola Co and International Business Machines Corp - were worth about $57.9 billion as of March 31, according to Wednesday’s filing. While large Berkshire investments are made by Buffett, smaller investments are often made by portfolio managers Todd Combs or Ted Weschler. Wednesday’s filing does not indicate who makes individual investments. Buffett, a buy-and-hold investor, has indicated that at least one of them trades more often than he does. On May 7, Weschler signed an agreement on Berkshire’s behalf allowing the company to boost its 14.2 percent stake in DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc, the largest U.S. operator of dialysis clinics, to as much as 25 percent. Berkshire added in the quarter to its stake in DaVita, and its stakes in several other companies including US Bancorp, retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc, satellite TV provider DirecTV and oilfield equipment provider National Oilwell Varco Inc. It also reported a new stake in premium TV cable network Starz, which was spun off in January Liberty Media Corp, which continues to be a Berkshire holding. It also reduced its stakes in food companies Kraft Foods Group Inc and Mondelez International Inc, and no longer reports stakes in grain trader Archer Daniels Midland Co and defense contractor General Dynamics Corp. In April, Berkshire began trimming what had been a 12.7 percent stake in Moody’s Corp, the parent of credit rating agency Moody’s Investors Service. It has held a double-digit percentage stake in Moody’s for more than a decade. Shares of Berkshire set record highs during Wednesday trading but closed mixed. The Class A shares fell $327 to $168,940, and the Class B shares rose 10 cents to $112.77.

479,BRKa,Rating for Buffett's Berkshire cut by S&P;,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) had its credit rating cut one notch by Standard & Poor’s, which cited a new methodology for evaluating insurers and Berkshire’s dependence on its insurance business for dividend income. The rating was cut to “AA” from “AA-plus,” and S&P; assigned a “negative” outlook, suggesting another cut could occur within a few years. S&P; left its credit and financial strength ratings for Berkshire’s insurance operating units at “AA-plus.” Thursday’s downgrade brings S&P;’s rating in line with the “Aa2” rating that Berkshire holds from Moody’s Investors Service. Those ratings are the agencies’ third-highest. “The lower credit rating on Berkshire better reflects our view of Berkshire’s dependence on its core insurance operations for most of its dividend income,” S&P; analyst John Iten wrote. Jeff Matthews, a Berkshire shareholder who has written books about the company, said S&P;’s concerns appeared overblown, citing the insurance units’ profitability and the $73 billion of “float,” or money held between when policyholders make payments and claims are paid, they provide to help Berkshire invest. “Which would S&P; rather have, a lousy insurance underwriter with ‘non-volatile’ investments, or a world-class insurance underwriter with world-class, if sometimes ‘volatile,’ investments?” he asked. Berkshire was rated “triple-A” by Moody’s and S&P; as recently as 2009. It lost the ratings after the global financial crisis boosted potential liabilities, and Buffett bought the railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp for $26.5 billion. S&P; said that while Berkshire retains a “very strong financial risk profile,” with noninsurance operations generating a majority of operating profit, only Burlington Northern provides a significant portion of total dividends paid by those operating companies to the parent holding company. Other negative factors cited by S&P; include Berkshire’s “high tolerance” for equity investments, which totaled $95.9 billion as of March 31 and can add capital volatility, and Berkshire’s eventual need to replace the 82-year-old Buffett.

480,BRKa,UPDATE 2-Rating for Buffett's Berkshire cut by S&P;,"* Rating cut to AA, in line with Moody’s, from AA-plus * S&P; cites dependence on insurance units for dividends By Jennifer Ablan, Ben Berkowitz and Jonathan Stempel May 16 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc   had its credit rating cut one notch by Standard & Poor’s, which cited a new methodology for evaluating insurers and Berkshire’s dependence on its insurance business for dividend income. The rating was cut to “AA” from “AA-plus,” and S&P; assigned a “negative” outlook, suggesting another cut could occur within a few years. S&P; left its credit and financial strength ratings for Berkshire’s insurance operating units at “AA-plus.” Thursday’s downgrade brings S&P;’s rating in line with the “Aa2” rating that Berkshire holds from Moody’s Investors Service. Those ratings are the agencies’ third-highest. “The lower credit rating on Berkshire better reflects our view of Berkshire’s dependence on its core insurance operations for most of its dividend income,” S&P; analyst John Iten wrote. Jeff Matthews, a Berkshire shareholder who has written books about the company, said S&P;’s concerns appeared overblown, citing the insurance units’ profitability and the $73 billion of “float,” or money held between when policyholders make payments and claims are paid, they provide to help Berkshire invest. “Which would S&P; rather have, a lousy insurance underwriter with ‘non-volatile’ investments, or a world-class insurance underwriter with world-class, if sometimes ‘volatile,’ investments?” he asked. Berkshire was rated “triple-A” by Moody’s and S&P; as recently as 2009. It lost the ratings after the global financial crisis boosted potential liabilities, and Buffett bought the railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp for $26.5 billion. S&P; said that while Berkshire retains a “very strong financial risk profile,” with noninsurance operations generating a majority of operating profit, only Burlington Northern provides a significant portion of total dividends paid by those operating companies to the parent holding company. Other negative factors cited by S&P; include Berkshire’s “high tolerance” for equity investments, which totaled $95.9 billion as of March 31 and can add capital volatility, and Berkshire’s eventual need to replace the 82-year-old Buffett.

481,BRKa,S&P; cuts Berkshire Hathaway rating one notch to 'AA',"(Reuters) - Credit-rating agency Standard & Poor’s on Thursday cut its rating on Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N)(BRKb.N), the insurance and industrial conglomerate controlled by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, one notch, citing the company’s reliance on its insurance operations for dividend income. S&P; cut the counterparty rating on Berkshire to “AA” from “AA+,” but the agency left Berkshire’s insurance units’ financial strength ratings intact at “AA+.” “The lower credit rating on BRK better reflects our view of BRK’s dependence on its core insurance operations for most of its dividend income,” said Standard & Poor’s analyst John Iten. The outlook on all ratings is negative, S&P; said in a statement, and cited two reasons: a ratings cap for financial companies linked to the U.S. sovereign rating; and capital risks at the insurance unit. Specifically, the agency said, there is the concern that if the insurance unit takes on more investment risk or funds a large acquisition, it could hurt capital adequacy for the insurance business. S&P; noted Berkshire’s high appetite for equity investments has made the insurance unit’s capital volatile and has resulted in “capital adequacy of the insurance operations being less than what we typically expect for the rating category.” ",5162013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-sp-downgrade/sp-cuts-berkshire-hathaway-rating-one-notch-to-aa-idUSBRE94F0MJ20130516

483,BRKa,"UPDATE 2-Buffett pays $5.6 bln for Vegas utility, bulks up in West","May 29 (Reuters) - A Berkshire Hathaway Inc unit will pay $5.6 billion for NV Energy Inc, the electric utility serving Las Vegas and its power-hungry casinos, in yet another large energy deal for Warren Buffett in the western United States. Berkshire’s MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co said on Wednesday it will buy NV Energy for $23.75 per share, a 23 percent premium to NV’s Wednesday closing price. NV Energy shares rose to $23.90 in after-hours trading on Wednesday. It is not uncommon for shares in Buffett’s target companies to trade slightly above the offer price, even where there are no competing bids and Buffett has said explicitly the offer is his best and final one. “Berkshire has a lot of cash earning very little. If this is a $5.6 billion cash deal, then Berkshire turns low-yielding cash into $330 million of earnings,” said Steve Check, president of Check Capital Management, an investment advisory firm, referring to NV Energy’s earnings over the last 12 months. “Nevada has historically been a fairly fast growth area,” Check said. “Add it all up, and I’m sure this will be another good, safe investment for Berkshire.” NV Energy, which is based in Las Vegas and serves about 2.4 million people in Nevada, said last month it would accelerate the retirement of its coal-fired power generating facilities and the construction of natural gas and renewable power plants. “We are pleased to make a long-term investment in Nevada’s economy,” Buffett, the billionaire investor who is Berkshire Hathaway’s chairman, said in a statement. In 2006, MidAmerican paid $5.1 billion for PacifiCorp, which serves California, Idaho, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. The deal is also complementary to recent MidAmerican investments in renewable energy, including some big bets next door in California. MidAmerican is building the world’s largest photovoltaic solar power plant in San Luis Obispo County, as well as a 160-megawatt geothermal plant near the Salton Sea. NV Energy has just passed 1 gigawatt of renewable energy, with a target of 25 percent renewables by 2025, and is the largest user of geothermal energy in the United States. Once the NV Energy deal is complete, MidAmerican will have assets of about $66 billion and its regulated electric and gas utilities will serve 8.4 million customers. According to a filing with U.S. financial regulators, NV Energy will have to pay MidAmerican $170 million if it terminates the merger under certain circumstances. The deal is expected to close in the 2014 first quarter. Lazard served NV Energy as financial adviser, while Sidley Austin LLP, Hogan Lovells and Reno-based Woodburn and Wedge were its legal advisers.",5292013,http://www.reuters.com/article/nveenergy-berkshire/update-2-buffett-pays-5-6-bln-for-vegas-utility-bulks-up-in-west-idUSL3N0EA3SB20130529

485,BRKa,Analysis: Buffett utility deal may signal big push to invest cash,"(Reuters) - MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co, a core part of Warren Buffett’s sprawling business empire, is becoming a favorite way for the “Oracle of Omaha” to invest the billions of dollars of cash on Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s (BRKa.N) balance sheet. The unit’s $5.6 billion acquisition of Nevada’s NV Energy NVE.N, announced last week, vaulted MidAmerican to ninth place in terms of U.S. electric utility customers from fourteenth, according to data compiled by Reuters, and fits right into Buffett’s strategy of owning businesses with large, predictable cash flows. But some on Wall Street say there is another, less obvious reason for such a deal: The 82-year-old Buffett is beginning to tie up the nearly $50 billion of cash on Berkshire’s balance sheet to assuage concerns about a leadership transition when he dies or becomes too infirm to run the conglomerate. Though investors trust that Buffett will put an appropriate successor in place, they acknowledge that, as the world’s most successful value investor, he is a special case. Berkshire Vice Chairman Charles Munger last year said MidAmerican could deploy as much as $100 billion over the next 10 to 15 years. “The energy sector looks to be a pathway for (Buffett) to invest a lot of money,” said David Rolfe, chief investment officer of St. Louis-based Wedgewood Partners, which has about $300 million invested in Berkshire Hathaway stock. “There is a very good chance that 10 years from now it’s the largest part of Berkshire, easily.” Including the NV Energy deal, which is the largest in the global energy and power sector so far this year, MidAmerican makes up only about 10 percent of Berkshire’s pre-tax earnings, dwarfed by the company’s vast insurance holdings. But that is expected to change. “What (MidAmerican and railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe) have done is guaranteed the cash flows get reinvested back into those businesses,” said Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren. “It eliminates some of the risk to whoever succeeds him of having too much cash on the balance sheet and not enough good ideas.” BNSF has been investing in the expansion of rail infrastructure in the United States and in new technologies such as powering locomotives with natural gas in a bid to increase profitability. MidAmerican, which will own two Western utilities after the NV Energy deal, could seek out other power companies in that region, though analysts said the company would be more driven by valuation than geography. In his most recent letter to shareholders, Buffett called MidAmerican’s earnings “recession-resistant” because the company offers “an essential service.” Once the NV Energy deal closes, MidAmerican will have $66 billion in assets. Those include the Kern River natural gas pipeline, a newly formed renewables division that oversees unregulated solar, wind, hydropower and geothermal projects, and even a real estate brokerage firm, HomeServices of America. Buffett has also figured out how to generate stable returns in renewable energy by investing in projects that come with long-term contracts to sell their output to utilities. The regulated utilities are MidAmerican’s primary focus, however, and include Oregon-based PacifiCorp, Iowa’s MidAmerican Energy Co and Northern Powergrid in England. Together, those utilities will serve 8.4 million customers once NV Energy is folded into the mix. In MidAmerican’s leadership, Buffett also has one of his most trusted lieutenants: Greg Abel, the unit’s chief executive. Abel, who has been instrumental in MidAmerican’s many acquisitions over the last decade, is widely considered to be among the internal candidates that could succeed Buffett, who has sung Abel’s praises repeatedly over the years. Abel declined an interview request. Berkshire has long exerted little day-to-day influence over its subsidiaries, and thus Abel operates MidAmerican - and overseas acquisitions - with a lot of freedom. MidAmerican’s former chairman and one-time Buffett heir apparent, David Sokol, resigned after trading stock in a company Berkshire was trying to buy. That scandal enveloped Berkshire two years ago. Since then Abel and other internal candidates, including Ajit Jain, Buffett’s top insurance executive and Matthew Rose of BNSF, have emerged as possible future chief executives. Deals like NV Energy allow Berkshire to deploy capital into riskier ventures, such as his rescue investment in Goldman Sachs (GS.N) at the height of the credit crisis in 2008, said Michael Yoshikami, CEO of Destination Wealth Management in Walnut Creek, California. For his next mega-deal, many on Wall Street suspect Buffett may look to the industrial sector, where valuations are low compared with utilities. But once utility valuations pull back a bit, Yoshikami said, “he will be all over it.” ",6052013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshirehathaway-midamerican-analysi/analysis-buffett-utility-deal-may-signal-big-push-to-invest-cash-idUSBRE95419920130605
486,BRKa,"Buffett charity lunch fetches $1 million bid, down from $3.46 million last year","(Reuters) - The yet-unidentified winner of an online charity auction will pay $1 million to lunch with Warren Buffett and friends, a relative bargain compared with last year’s top bid that came in at more than three times the amount. The event raises funds for the San Francisco-based charity GLIDE, which provides meals, shelter and other services for the area’s poor. The annual auction for the chance to dine with the “Oracle of Omaha” had reached record price levels in recent years. Last year’s winning bid was $3.46 million, which topped the previous year’s $2.63 million top bid from fund manager Ted Weschler, who was later hired as an investment manager at Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. This year’s anonymous winner, who paid the lowest amount in six years at exactly $1,000,100, will have lunch with the Nebraska billionaire and up to seven friends at Smith & Wollensky in New York City. The five-day auction on eBay, which closed on Friday evening, received 106 bids. Buffett, 82, who was introduced to GLIDE by his late first wife Susan, has held 14 auctions raising more than $15 million for the organization, which was founded 50 years ago. The San Francisco Business Times reported the Rev. Cecil Williams, GLIDE’s founder, as saying budget cuts were likely due to the surprisingly low auction results. Williams, speaking to Reuters on Saturday, said the quote was inaccurate, and GLIDE would continue its fundraising efforts to meet its $17 million annual budget. He expressed gratitude for Buffett’s longtime support and for the winning bid, calling it an important gift. “We never know what will come. So we are very proud about what has taken place last night, and we feel we are on the right direction, doing the right thing, and making it count,” Williams said.

Heinz Co announced the departure of 11 executives on Thursday in a management shakeup less than two weeks after its new owners, 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), closed their $28 billion acquisition. The world’s largest ketchup maker revealed a new management team of 11 executives, nine of whom are already with Pittsburgh-based Heinz. “This announcement demonstrates the power and potential of meritocracy at work here at Heinz,” said Bernardo Hees, who recently became chief executive officer after leading Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N, another 3G investment. Two of the new executives have ties to 3G, a private equity firm with Brazilian roots and a reputation for aggressive cost-cutting. One is Paulo Basilio, whose appointment as chief financial officer was announced on June 7, when the deal closed. The other is Eduardo Pelleissone, who joins as executive vice president of operations from America Latina Logistica, a Brazilian logistics company. 3G co-founder Alex Behring is also a co-founder and former CEO of America Latina Logistica.

494,BRKa,Unusual Leap options trades before pending deal raise eyebrows,"* Leap call options volume surges during Friday’s session * July and August $9 strike calls stand out * Leap spokesman declines to comment on its option activity By Doris Frankel July 12 (Reuters) - Unusual buying of bullish options in prepaid wireless carrier Leap Wireless International Inc  before a takeover bid by AT&T; was announced on Friday has raised questions that the news may have reached investors ahead of time. Average daily option volume in Leap options is 1,320 contracts traded over the last three months. But during Friday’s trading session, option volume on Leap surged to 7,139 contracts, of which only 350 were puts, resulting in a call-to-put ratio of 20 to 1, according to options analytics firm Livevol based in San Francisco. Traders focused on Leap calls that were above the value of the stock, several options participants said. “Based on the unusually high volume of options traded and the out-of-the-money calls that were purchased on Friday, it appears that prior knowledge of this takeover may have been leaked and traded on,” said Ophir Gottlieb, managing director of Livevol. Under the merger agreement, AT&T; will acquire all of Leap’s stock and approximately 5 million subscribers for $15 per share in cash or about $1.2 billion. The offer represents a premium of 88 percent to Leap’s Friday closing price of $7.98. Traders typically buy out-of-the-money calls because they can put the least amount of money at risk and realize the highest return if a merger announcement is made. A particularly aggressive trade involved 1,300 July $9 strike Leap calls purchased for about 10 cents per contract, or a premium payment of $13,000, Gottlieb said. As of after hours trading, with the stock trading at $16.80, those calls are in the money by $7.80. In addition, Gottlieb noted that 1,400 August $9 strike calls were purchased for an average price of 40 cents per contract and are at least $7.80 in the money based on after hours stock trading. Owners of calls, contracts which allow them to buy the company’s shares at a fixed price by a certain date, benefit because the value of the call option goes up as the stock rises. A put conveys the right to sell the stock at a preset price. AT&T; and Leap did not announce their deal until after the stock market closed. The flurry in option trading in a target company’s options could be speculative. But the timing of large options trades on Leap while the markets were still open raised eyebrows among some option participants. Around 2:30 p.m. ET, the buying started in the August $9 strike calls and in the July $9 calls, trading started at 3:42 p.m. ET for about 9 to 10 cents per contracts, according to data from Trade Alert, an options analytics firm. “It looks pretty clear that somebody caught wind of the deal,” said Trade Alert president Henry Schwartz. Livevol’s Gottlieb said he was struck by the unusual volume during a three-minute window - 3:42 p.m. to 3:45 p.m., just 15 minutes before the close - in the July $9 strike calls. “It indicates that a single trader may have been trying to hide his large trades by breaking it into smaller sizes,” Gottlieb said. A spokesman for exchange operator CBOE Holdings said the CBOE’s Department of Market Regulation reviews unusual activity on a regular basis but does not comment on specific investigations. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which looks into unusual stock and option trading, did not immediately respond to an email from Reuters. A Leap spokesman declined to comment on the options activity. In a number of recent cases, bullish bets in U.S. options ahead of several takeover announcements have raised red flags that investors may have been tipped off. The SEC has moved quickly, obtaining emergency orders to keep traders from cashing in by freezing their accounts. The SEC last week filed a lawsuit accusing unnamed defendants of insider trading in Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc call options before the drugmaker publicly rejected a takeover bid by larger rival Amgen Inc and put itself up for sale. The U.S. regulator last month obtained a court order freezing the assets of a Thailand-based trader, saying he reaped $3.2 million in illegal profits after getting a tip ahead of the announcement that a Chinese meat company was buying U.S. pork producer Smithfield Foods Inc. In February, the SEC won a freeze on a Swiss account linked to suspicious trading in H.J. Heinz Co call options before the ketchup maker was bought by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and Brazilian firm 3G Capital.",7132013,http://www.reuters.com/article/leap-options-calls/unusual-leap-options-trades-before-pending-deal-raise-eyebrows-idUSL1N0FJ00A20130713
495,BRKa,"Berkshire profit rises 46 percent, helped by economy","(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) on Friday said second-quarter profit rose 46 percent, boosted by improved demand in such businesses as car insurance, energy and railroads, as well as gains from investments and derivatives. Operating results topped analyst forecasts, reflecting how many of Berkshire’s more than 80 businesses are benefiting from growth, however modest, in the U.S. economy. “It’s about as good as you could expect,” said Jeff Matthews, a Berkshire shareholder and author of “Secrets in Plain Sight: Business and Investing Secrets of Warren Buffett.” “Berkshire’s earnings are very similar to the economy - not shooting the lights out but still growing.” Buffett, who turns 83 later this month, has run Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire since 1965, and favors businesses with consistent earnings power. In June, he spent $12.3 billion to buy part of H.J. Heinz Co, the maker of ketchup and Ore-Ida potato products. A month earlier, the world’s fourth-richest person told shareholders at that in looking for companies to buy, “we’re going to find most of our opportunities in the United States.” Quarterly net income for Berkshire rose to $4.54 billion, or $2,763 per Class A share, from $3.11 billion, or $1,882 per share, a year earlier. Operating profit rose 5 percent to $3.92 billion, or $2,384 per Class A share, from $3.72 billion, or $2,252 per share. Analysts on average expected operating profit of $2,170 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 16 percent from a year ago to $44.69 billion. Book value per Class A share, Buffett’s preferred measure of growth, rose 2 percent from the end of March to $122,900. Profit rose 10 percent at the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad to $884 million as higher revenue from shipping consumer products, industrial products and coal offset lower revenue from agricultural products. Rising prices and higher customer loads helped drive a 10 percent increase in profit from its MidAmerican Energy utilities and energy unit to $279 million. Meanwhile, pretax underwriting gains more than doubled at the Geico car insurance unit to $336 million, as premiums earned grew by 11 percent while underwriting expenses fell. Businesses benefiting from growing sales included the NetJets corporate plane unit, the Clayton Homes manufactured housing unit, and the Forest River recreational vehicle unit. Other businesses fared less well. Underwriting gains in reinsurance operations, including General Re, declined in part from catastrophe losses tied to European floods. Berkshire also said growing price competition and “relatively sluggish customer demand in certain markets” hurt earnings at its Iscar metalworking, Lubrizol specialty chemical and Fruit of the Loom underwear businesses. The quarter also included $622 million of net gains from investments and derivatives, compared with a year-earlier $612 million net loss. Accounting rules require Berkshire to report these sums with its earnings, and Buffett believes the amounts in any given quarter are often meaningless. The company’s cash stake shrank during the quarter to $35.7 billion from $49.1 billion, largely reflecting the purchase of Heinz by Berkshire and Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital. Another $5.6 billion in cash will go toward the purchase of Nevada utility NV Energy Inc NVE.N by MidAmerican Energy, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014. And this week, building supply unit MiTek Industries said it bought Benson Industries LLC, which designs curtain wall systems for buildings such as One World Trade Center and the United Nations Secretariat, for an undisclosed price.

498,BRKa,UPDATE 4-Amazon's Bezos to buy the Washington Post for $250 mln,"By Jennifer Saba Aug 5 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos will buy the Washington Post newspaper for $250 million in a surprise deal that ends the Graham family’s 80 years of ownership and hands one of the country’s most influential publications to the businessman whose Internet company has transformed retailing. Bezos, hailed by many as technology visionary, called his acquisition a personal endeavor and reassured employees and readers of the 135-year-old newspaper he will preserve its journalistic tradition, while driving innovation. The acquisition, the latest in a flurry of deals for print publications including the New York Times Co’s sale of the Boston Globe for $70 million, is a another sign of the unprecedented challenges newspapers face as advertising revenue and readership decline. Shares of the Washington Post Co climbed more than 5 percent to $599.85 after hours - their highest level in almost five years. Donald Graham, the chairman and CEO of the Washington Post Co, said in an interview that he and his niece Katharine Weymouth, the Post’s publisher, made the decision to put the newspaper up for sale earlier this year after looking at its financial forecasts. “For the first time in either of our lives we said to each other: is ownership by the Washington Post Co the best thing for the newspaper? We could keep it alive, that wasn’t the issue. The issue was could we make it strong?” Graham and Bezos discussed the deal at two meetings in Sun Valley, Idaho during the annual Allen & Co media and tech conference in July. The investment bank had been retained earlier in the year to gauge potential buyer interest, and is now the banker on the deal. Graham’s company had talked to no more than a dozen parties about selling the paper. He declined to name the other parties. “I named a price and Jeff agreed to pay it,” said Graham, who initially thought Bezos would be an unlikely buyer. “To my surprise, when (Allen & Co) said they would call him, I said that would be great but I didn’t think he would be interested.” The investment bank ended up advising on the deal. At a meeting in January, Graham said longtime friend and former Washington Post board member Warren Buffett referred to Bezos as the best CEO in the United States for his technology and business acumen. “I asked (Bezos) why he wanted to do it and his reasons are the best ones: he believes in what newspapers do and what the Post does and that it’s important to the country,” Graham said. The Amazon CEO took that message directly to employees in a letter posted on the newspaper’s website. “I understand the critical role the Post plays in Washington, DC and our nation, and the Post’s values will not change,” Bezos wrote in the letter. “There will of course be change at the Post over the coming years. That’s essential and would have happened with or without new ownership,” Bezos added. “We will need to invent, which means we will need to experiment.” In addition to the newspaper, Bezos gets other publishing businesses, including the Express newspaper, The Gazette Newspapers, Southern Maryland Newspapers, Fairfax County Times, El Tiempo Latino and Greater Washington Publishing. The real estate, including the paper’s headquarters business and online news sites such as Slate, will remain with the Washington Post Co. And the paper’s operations will be kept separate from Amazon.com, according to the Washington Post. The Washington Post is the seventh largest daily in the United States and was where journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein broke the “Watergate” story which led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon in 1974. While its legend and status loomed large, the Washington Post represents only a fraction of the company which has expanded into a stable of holdings, including education and health care services and most recently an industrial supplier. The collection of companies that make up the Washington Post is akin to that of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc , which owns disparate businesses from railroads to underwear as well as a stake in the Post. And yet, the Washington Post suffers from the same hurdles besieging big city newspapers across the United States. The company’s newspaper division reported an operating loss of $49.3 million for the six months ending June compared to a loss of $33.2 million during the same period last year. Weymouth, who will continue to serve as the paper’s CEO and publisher after the sale, told Reuters she did not think there was a “magic bullet” to resolving the problems. But the resources Bezos brought to the table were a plus. “He’s smart and innovative and has access to a lot of smart people,” she said. Bezos, who has built Seattle-based Amazon.com into a shopping and online technology force over the last two decades, made a small foray into media earlier this year with an investment in Internet news site Business Insider. Bezos is the world’s 19th richest person with a fortune of $25.2 billion, according to Forbes magazine. His investment vehicle, Bezos Expeditions, is invested in a number of companies including Twitter and Business Insider. His major personal project is called Blue Origin, which aims to be one of the first non-government funded ventures to send people and cargo into space, potentially winning lucrative contracts that were once fulfilled by NASA. Bezos has already spent millions of dollars on this project, with millions more in the pipeline. He did not elaborate in great detail on his motivations behind his latest deal, which caught many industry watchers by surprise. He does not play a prominent role in politics but has been described by friends as holding libertarian views. He and his wife did make public a $2.5 million contribution to a Washington state campaign to legalize same-sex marriage last year. The deal comes on the heels of near-unprecedented media deal activity this year, with the Globe transaction announced just over the weekend, News Corp spinning out its newspapers, and the Tribune Co hiving off its publishing business like the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune from its broadcasting division. Free of its print assets, the Washington Post could continue to snap up other properties that align with the six TV stations in cities like Houston, Washington DC and Miami and cable TV services in more than a dozen states. “It will be interesting to see, is this the first step in the transformation of the business?” said John Miller, senior vice president at Chicago’s Ariel Investments, a top-10 investor in the Washington Post. “The board is making the right decision. They obviously felt like it was a good deal. It will be interesting to see how they allocate capital going forward.”",8062013,http://www.reuters.com/article/washingtonpost-bezos/update-4-amazons-bezos-to-buy-the-washington-post-for-250-mln-idUSL1N0G61ES20130806

500,BRKa,"Buffett's Berkshire buys Suncor, Dish as stock bet grows","(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) reported new stakes in Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO) and Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) as the company run by Warren Buffett added billions of dollars of stock investments. The changes were disclosed in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing made public on Thursday, which detailed $89 billion of Berkshire equity investments, mostly listed on U.S. exchanges, as of June 30. U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter, and the disclosures can offer a window into their strategies for buying and selling stocks. Berkshire took a 17.8 million-share stake in Calgary-based Suncor, which is Canada’s biggest oil and gas producer and has a large presence in the Alberta oil sands. That stake was valued at $524 million at the end of the second quarter. It also reported a small, 547,312-share stake in Dish, the satellite TV company run by billionaire Charlie Ergen, valued at $23.3 million on June 30. Suncor spokeswoman Kelli Stevens declined to comment, saying the company does not typically discuss individual investors’ holdings. Dish spokesman Bob Toevs also declined to comment. Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire discloses sizable new investments because investors try to copy Buffett, the world’s fourth-richest person according to Forbes magazine. In afternoon trading, Suncor shares were up 68 cents, or 2 percent, at C$34.47. Dish shares were down 29 cents at $44.47. David McColl, a Morningstar Inc equity analyst in Chicago, said a shortage of pipelines has forced Suncor and rivals to move more products by rail, but that Suncor has indicated an ability to address this problem in the next one to five years. “Suncor is one of the most heavily undervalued Canadian integrated oil producers,” he said. “It is no surprise that a value investor like Berkshire Hathaway would view it as a phenomenal investment opportunity.” Berkshire has benefited this year from Buffett’s preference for investments in businesses and stocks over fixed income, which has been under pressure from rising interest rates. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company’s book value per share, Buffett’s preferred measure of growth, grew 7.6 percent from January to June. Its largest stock holding, Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), grew 1.1 percent in the second quarter to 463.1 million shares, equal to a $19.1 billion stake in the fourth-largest U.S. bank. Berkshire spent $4.64 billion on stocks in the quarter. While Buffett has said he makes Berkshire’s largest investments, some investments are made by portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who oversee several billion dollars each. Thursday’s filing did not say who bought what, but said that some holdings were reported confidentially to the SEC. Buffett sometimes gets SEC permission to amass big positions quietly so he need not worry about copycat investors. One of Berkshire’s top holdings, a $13 billion stake in International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), was built in this manner. Earlier this month, Berkshire said it ended June with $101.9 billion of equity securities overall. Its top four holdings - Wells Fargo, Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), IBM and American Express Co (AXP.N) - were worth more than $59 billion as of June 30. Berkshire also owns more than 80 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, utilities, chemicals, apparel and food. In recent months, it bought half of ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co and made several smaller acquisitions. On Wednesday, its HomeServices of America Inc unit, the second-largest U.S. full-service residential real estate brokerage, said it bought real estate service companies Prudential Fox & Roach and Trident Group for undisclosed prices. During the quarter, Berkshire added to stakes in Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), automaker General Motors Co (GM.N), oilfield equipment provider National Oilwell Varco Inc (NOV.N), US Bancorp (USB.N) and Verisign Inc (VRSN.O), which assigns Internet protocol addresses.

504,BRKa,U.S. judge approves $72 million settlement with Berkshire's Gen Re,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday approved a $72 million settlement to resolve shareholder claims that Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s (BRKa.N) General Re Corp engaged in a sham deal that helped inflate American International Group Inc’s (AIG.N) reserves. Approval of the settlement brings to an end nine years of shareholder litigation surrounding AIG’s accounting practices and brings the total of approved settlements to more than $1 billion. U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts, who approved the settlement at a hearing in Manhattan, said the accord was a “long time coming” and would close out the AIG litigation before her. “I’m sorry to see it end, but not that sorry,” she said. In April, Batts approved a related $115 million settlement with former AIG CEO Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, three other executives and two of Greenberg’s companies. Before that she signed off on a $725 million settlement with AIG and a $97.5 million accord with accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers PWC.UL. Batts initially in 2010 declined to preliminarily approve the Gen Re settlement, instead dismissing claims against the company, but the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York reversed her in August 2012. The lawsuit, led by two Ohio state pension funds, alleged that AIG and Gen Re violated federal securities laws through a $500 million reinsurance transaction in 2000 that boosted AIG’s loss reserves and artificially increased its share price. The events took place years before AIG received $182 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. In making the settlement, Gen Re did not admit liability or wrongdoing. Representatives for the company did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. The alleged sham transaction was at the center of a criminal case against four former Gen Re executives and one AIG executive who were convicted in 2008 on fraud charges. A federal appeals court reversed their convictions in 2011. The five subsequently admitted to conducting the fraudulent reinsurance transaction as part of a deferred prosecution agreement in June 2012. The executives were former Gen Re Chief Executive Ronald Ferguson, Chief Financial Officer Elizabeth Monrad, Senior Vice President Christopher Garand and Assistant General Counsel Robert Graham, as well as former AIG Vice President Christian Milton. In 2010, Gen Re agreed to pay $92.2 million to settle U.S. government claims that it helped AIG manipulate its financial statements.

505,BRKa,UPDATE 1-U.S. judge approves $72 mln settlement with Berkshire's Gen Re,"By Nate Raymond NEW YORK, Sept 10 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday approved a $72 million settlement to resolve shareholder claims that Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s General Re Corp engaged in a sham deal that helped inflate American International Group Inc’s reserves. Approval of the settlement brings to an end nine years of shareholder litigation surrounding AIG’s accounting practices and brings the total of approved settlements to more than $1 billion. U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts, who approved the settlement at a hearing in Manhattan, said the accord was a “long time coming” and would close out the AIG litigation before her. “I’m sorry to see it end, but not that sorry,” she said. In April, Batts approved a related $115 million settlement with former AIG CEO Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, three other executives and two of Greenberg’s companies. Before that she signed off on a $725 million settlement with AIG and a $97.5 million accord with accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. Batts initially in 2010 declined to preliminarily approve the Gen Re settlement, instead dismissing claims against the company, but the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York reversed her in August 2012.

506,BRKa,Insight: U.S. banks surrender future profit for capital relief now,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. banks are increasingly giving up the right to sell tens of billions of securities in their investment portfolios, a shift that helps them avoid the pain of weaker bond markets but will cut into future profits as interest rates rise. Lenders ranging from large banks like U.S. Bancorp to smaller banks like Cullen/Frost Bankers Inc have been changing the way they account for investment securities, adopting a treatment that essentially forces them to hold onto bonds through thick and thin, instead of being able to sell them when markets tank. The accounting switch gives them near-term relief that helps them meet new international capital and liquidity rules. But analysts fear that as bond markets keep weakening, banks will be stuck with more turkeys in their portfolios, giving them less cash to invest or lend at higher rates. The willingness of lenders to surrender future profits shows the pressures they face in an era of restrictive regulations, soft loan demand and historically low rates that are now poised to rise. The exposure of banks to rising interest rates threatens to undo much of the progress that lenders had made in building capital since the financial crisis, said David Hendler, an analyst at New York research firm CreditSights. “You’ve got all these hurdles that banks have to jump over, and they get higher and higher,” Hendler said, adding that the challenges are testing the acumen of bank treasury and finance departments. “A lot of these guys didn’t train for this.” The accounting shift is known as moving assets from “available-for-sale” treatment to “held-to-maturity,” a change that has been underway for several years. U.S. commercial banks’ held-to-maturity books increased 62 percent to $347.4 billion in the second quarter from $215.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010, according to SNL Financial. As bond markets weakened in the second quarter, the switch accelerated, with held-to-maturity accounts rising 8.7 percent from the first quarter, the biggest increase in nearly two years. One of the first big banks to make the shift was U.S. Bancorp of Minneapolis, Minnesota, the sixth-largest U.S. bank, with $353.4 billion in assets. The bank is a favorite of Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc is one of its biggest shareholders. U.S. Bancorp’s held-to-maturity securities book ballooned to $34.7 billion at the end of the second quarter, or 46 percent of its investment portfolio, from just $1.5 billion at the end of 2010, with most of the change coming in 2011. In January 2012, U.S. Bancorp finance chief Andrew Cecere told analysts and investors the bank used the held-to-maturity book to help manage new regulatory requirements for liquidity and capital. But the bank is now saddled with tens of billions of dollars in low-yielding assets. The weighted average yield on U.S. Bancorp’s held-to-maturity portfolio was 1.89 percent in the second quarter of 2013, compared with 2.72 percent for the available-for-sale portfolio. As rates start to rise, the bank could earn less on some assets than it has to pay to fund itself, cutting into its income. To be sure, banks have some ways to mitigate that pain. For example, they can borrow against the held-to-maturity assets and invest the proceeds. And many bank loans carry floating rates, so rising rates will boost interest income. But banks that go too far with a held-to-maturity strategy will not be able to free up as much of their balance sheet to make new loans if the economy improve in the coming months, said Johannes Palsson, managing director at Angel Oak Advisory, a risk management consulting firm. Those banks are “kind of stuck. There’s not much you can do” to take advantage of future loan growth, Palsson said in an interview. For available-for-sale assets, banks must record paper losses each quarter when the securities’ values fall. The paper losses do not hit earnings but reduce net worth, as measured by the book value of assets minus liabilities. That happened to banks in the second quarter, when bond markets weakened amid talk of the Federal Reserve cutting back on its bond buying program. The $38 billion of unrealized investment gains they had reported at the start of the year swung to $13.1 billion of paper losses by the end of August, according to Federal Reserve data. For a long time, regulators ignored changes in the value of available-for-sale books when assessing a bank’s capital strength. But under the framework known as Basel III that international regulators finalized in December 2010, losses from available-for-sale assets will hit regulatory capital, and a bond market selloff could force U.S. banks to boost their capital levels. Paper losses on held-to-maturity securities, however, would not subtract from banks’ capital levels. This, along with new liquidity rules that pressured banks to increase their securities holdings, encouraged banks to park assets in their held-to-maturity bucket of their investment portfolios. Bank officials have argued that regulators are pulling them in too many directions without much consideration about how the new rules interact with each other. Hearing those complaints, earlier this year U.S. regulators exempted banks with less than $250 billion in assets from capital rules linked to available-for-sale books. But for some that ruling came too late. For instance, Cullen/Frost, a San Antonio, Texas bank with $22.6 billion in assets, classified $2.6 billion of its municipal bond portfolio as held-to-maturity in last year’s fourth quarter. It made the move because regulators seemed “incapable” of stripping out the requirement to subtract paper losses on securities from capital ratios, finance chief Phillip Green said on an earnings call with analysts at the time. “That was absolutely ridiculous for a bank like ours” which is flush with liquidity and has never had a problem funding its securities portfolio, Cullen/Frost Chief Investment Officer Bill Sirakos said in an interview about the Fed’s initial proposal. But that transfer proved unnecessary when the bank was later exempted. Sirakos said the bank didn’t have any big regrets about its use of the held-to-maturity account. “We gave up some flexibility, but we generally hold the stuff to maturity anyway,” he said. Though regulators can easily reverse course, under accounting rules banks cannot. If they chose to sell some securities out of the held-to-maturity portfolio, outside of few extreme circumstances ,the entire portfolio becomes “tainted.” Once that happens, all held-to-maturity securities — not just the ones the bank planned to sell — are transferred to banks’ available-for-sale books where any unrealized loss immediately detracts from their net worth. Additionally, the bank would be prohibited from using hold-to-maturity portfolios for two years. With that inflexibility, some banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co have opted to accept the risk of rising rates clobbering their investment portfolios, and use held-to-maturity accounting for little-to-none of their investment securities.

AIG stopped entering new deals with Berkshire units including National Indemnity Co. and General Re about two months ago, but existing contracts will not be affected, Bloomberg said, citing the person. The decision comes after Berkshire hired away senior AIG executives and Buffett said he planned to expand his company’s commercial insurance operations that compete with AIG. A spokesman for AIG declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Berkshire did not immediately return a request for comment.

509,BRKa,Fitch Affirms Ratings of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'AA-' Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK) and the 'AA+'  Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings on BRK's key insurance subsidiaries.  The Rating Outlook is Stable. A complete list of rating actions follows at the  end of this release.  Fitch's ratings on BRK are supported by extremely strong capitalization and  market position of its insurance subsidiaries, solid operating performance with  good diversification across business lines and excellent financial flexibility  and liquidity.  Also considered in the ratings are material equity market risk, insured natural  catastrophe exposures, growing exposure to asbestos and environmental risk and  various issues associated with the company's acquisition strategy.  BRK's consolidated financial leverage was 24% of total capital as of June 30,  2013. Consolidated interest coverage for the first six months of 2013 was 9.4x  and excluded investment and derivative gains or losses from the calculation.  BRK's debt-to-total capital and debt-to-tangible capital ratios at the holding  company level (including debt issued by the company's finance segment  subsidiaries that is guaranteed by BRK) were moderate at 17% and 22%,  respectively at June 30, 2013. BRK's ability to fund finance operations at a low  cost is an important competitive advantage for the finance operations and a  considerable portion of the finance company debt is guaranteed by BRK. Fitch's expectation is that BRK's major non-insurance business units, including  the company's utilities and railroad business, will service their own debt. BRK reported net income of $9.4 billion for the first half of 2013, up from $6.4  billion in the comparable period of 2012. All segments reported growth in  pre-tax earnings, but the insurance segment was responsible for the majority of  the period-to-period increase. BRK's insurance group reported $4.7 billion in  earnings before tax in the first half of 2013, accounting for 39% of BRK's $12.1  billion in total pre-tax earnings. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad operation continues to make  significant contributions to earnings. BNSF reported a pretax gain of $2.7  billion (22% of BRK's total pre-tax earnings) for the first six months of 2013,  up from $2.4 billion over the comparable period in 2012. BRK's first half 2013 annualized return on equity was 9.8%, excluding unrealized  gains on fixed income securities, up from 7.5% in the comparable period of 2012.  Consolidated operating interest coverage for the first six months of 2013 was  9.4X, which is below Fitch's expectations of 12x for companies at BRK's rating  level. Somewhat offsetting this is approximately $31 billion of cash and  equivalents mostly at the insurance operating companies at June 30, 2013, which  would cover annual interest expense by 11x.  BRK's GAAP basis earnings will continue to be exposed to earnings volatility  given the large notional values and long duration of BRK's outstanding  derivative contracts. Additionally, Fitch believes that BRK's earnings will be  exposed to potential volatility from the company's reinsurance businesses and  its exposure to catastrophe-related losses as well as the company's large equity  investment portfolio. BRK has grown its asbestos & environmental insured liability exposure through  retroactive reinsurance contracts most notably with Equitas Limited, AIG and  CNA. Fitch estimates BRK has approximately $13 billion in A & E reserves at  year-end 2012 and these reserves covered average paid losses by greater than  15x. SENSITIVITY/RATING DRIVERS Key rating triggers that could lead to a future downgrade include: --Deterioration in the credit quality of key insurance subsidiaries (National  Indemnity, GenRe, and GEICO) that is no longer consistent with the current 'AA+'  rating. Measures of credit quality include Fitch's judgment of capitalization, a  total financing and commitments ratio greater than 1.5X, net leverage (excluding  affiliated investments) over 3.5X or a sharp and persistent reduction in  underwriting profits.  --A consolidated run-rate debt-to-total capital ratio that exceeds 30% or a  run-rate debt-to-total capital ratio from the holding company, insurance and  finance operations (including debt issued or guaranteed by the holding company)  that exceeds 25%. --Material increases in leveraged equity market exposure such as its equity  index put derivative portfolio.  --Acquisitions or other actions that reduce outstanding cash below $10 billion  or approximately 5X consolidated interest expense.    Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: --A commitment to lower debt-to-tangible capital ratios attributed to the  holding company, insurance and finance operations. Fitch believes that this  would likely require the scaling back of the finance operations.

510,BRKa,Heinz trades targeted by SEC unauthorized -Cayman Islands firm,"NEW YORK, Sept 17 (Reuters) - A Cayman Islands entity at the center of a U.S. investigation into possible insider trading in ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co said trades placed in its Swiss bank account were done by someone without permission. The filing by Alpine Swift Ltd late on Monday deepened a mystery over who placed an options trade that resulted in more than $1.7 million in profits in the run up to Heinz’s February announcement that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc  and Brazil’s 3G Capital would buy it.f The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued unknown traders over the suspicious trading in February. Soon after, a federal judge froze the assets at a bank account at Goldman Sachs & Co in Switzerland. The filings came in connection with a motion by Alpine to dismiss the case. A lawyer for Alpine Swift, an investment holding company, became the first person to appear for the defense in the case last week. Alpine Swift said it owned the bank account in court filings, but it also said the trade was done by someone who lacked permission to make the trade. “In fact, the trade was not authorized,” Alpine’s lawyers wrote. “It was placed by an individual who had no authority to place trades in Alpine’s account.” Alpine did not name the individual in its filings. A lawyer for Alpine, Juan Morillo of the global law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. The court filings also gave a view into the complex corporate structure behind Alpine, which has links to Brazil, where 3G Capital is based. Alpine said it was established in 2010 and has a single shareholder, a discretionary trust called the Troika Trust. The trust was formed under Cayman Islands laws and its sole purpose is “succession planning,” the filings said. An unnamed independent investment adviser, whose sole director is a Brazilian citizen, has full responsibility for investing the assets Alpine holds for the trust, the court filings said. Alpine said its beneficiaries are Cayman Island companies wholly owned by another unnamed Brazilian citizen. The Brazilian has no authority to withdraw funds or place trades, Alpine said. In the court filings, Alpine said it didn’t know about the Heinz trading until after the SEC filed its lawsuit. The company said Goldman told it that on Feb. 13, someone instructed the bank to buy 2,533 call options in Heinz via Alpine’s account. “This individual did not have a power of attorney or other authority to place transactions in Alpine’s account and placed the Heinz Transaction without Alpine’s knowledge,” Alpine’s lawyers wrote. The SEC’s lawsuit, filed on Feb. 15, said traders bought call options that climbed 1,700 percent after the formal announcement of the Heinz buyout. Since filing suit, the SEC has received nearly 800 pages related to Alpine’s Goldman account from the bank and delivered by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, Alpine said. The FBI had also said it was investigating the unusual trading activity, and Goldman Sachs had said it was cooperating with the SEC. Goldman, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment on ATuesday, has not been accused of wrongdoing. A spokesman for the SEC declined comment. The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Certain Unknown Traders in the Securities of H.J.

511,BRKa,Buffett lauds Bernanke but laments lack of investment bargains,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett said on Thursday he would recommend reappointing Ben Bernanke as Federal Reserve chairman, while adding that low interest rates have inflated asset values and complicated his hunt for investments at his company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. The billionaire investor spoke one day after the central bank surprised investors by postponing its expected wind-down of monetary stimulus, which has in five years more than tripled the Fed’s balance sheet to above $3.6 trillion. “Since the panic of five years ago, he’s done a terrific job,” Buffett said on CNBC television in a joint interview with Brian Moynihan, chief executive of Bank of America Corp. Asked if he would reappoint Bernanke when his term expires, Buffett said: “That’s what I would do.” Nevertheless, at an event later Thursday afternoon at Georgetown University, Buffett said that the Fed’s eventual exit from its monthly bond-buying program will carry unforeseen risks. “We are in an experiment which hasn’t really been tried before,” he said, adding that “buying securities is usually easier than selling securities.” Berkshire owns more than 80 businesses in such areas as insurance, chemicals, railroads and clothing, and has more than $130 billion of equity and fixed income investments. Some of its money went to Bank of America in August 2011, when Buffett announced a surprise $5 billion investment in the second-largest U.S. bank, which has been plagued by bad mortgages and legal liabilities mainly tied to the former Countrywide Financial Corp. The investment included preferred shares with a 6 percent dividend, plus warrants to buy 700 million shares at about $7.14 per share, and has given Berkshire a paper profit of several billion dollars because the bank’s shares have doubled. Moynihan said the bank has contracted in size and put many regulatory issues behind it, leaving it to focus on how best to grow in a slow-growth economy. “You have an economy which we see very constructive, growing at 1.5 to 2 percent,” he said. “We don’t see a lot of downside risk... Until unemployment is down, (Bernanke) has to keep this economy going in the right direction.” One side effect of the economic stimulus has been low interest rates, which Buffett called a “terribly important” variable in determining asset prices. With major stock indexes at or near record highs, it has been harder for the 83-year-old Buffett, the second-richest American, to pursue his value investing strategy at Berkshire. Stocks “were very cheap five years ago, ridiculously cheap, and that has been corrected,” Buffett said. “They’re probably more or less fairly priced now... We’re having a hard time finding things to buy.” Buffett had invested $5 billion in preferred stock of Goldman Sachs Group Inc and $3 billion in General Electric Co preferred stock at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. That gave him a reputation as a possible lender of last resort during times of stress.

Asked if he would reappoint Bernanke when his term expires, Buffett said: “That’s what I would do.” Nevertheless, at an event later Thursday afternoon at Georgetown University, Buffett said that the Fed’s eventual exit from its monthly bond-buying program will carry unforeseen risks. “We are in an experiment which hasn’t really been tried before,” he said, adding that “buying securities is usually easier than selling securities.” Berkshire owns more than 80 businesses in such areas as insurance, chemicals, railroads and clothing, and has more than $130 billion of equity and fixed income investments. Some of its money went to Bank of America in August 2011, when Buffett announced a surprise $5 billion investment in the second-largest U.S. bank, which has been plagued by bad mortgages and legal liabilities mainly tied to the former Countrywide Financial Corp. The investment included preferred shares with a 6 percent dividend, plus warrants to buy 700 million shares at about $7.14 per share, and has given Berkshire a paper profit of several billion dollars because the bank’s shares have doubled. Moynihan said the bank has contracted in size and put many regulatory issues behind it, leaving it to focus on how best to grow in a slow-growth economy. “You have an economy which we see very constructive, growing at 1.5 to 2 percent,” he said. “We don’t see a lot of downside risk... Until unemployment is down, (Bernanke) has to keep this economy going in the right direction.” One side effect of the economic stimulus has been low interest rates, which Buffett called a “terribly important” variable in determining asset prices. With major stock indexes at or near record highs, it has been harder for the 83-year-old Buffett, the second-richest American, to pursue his value investing strategy at Berkshire. Stocks “were very cheap five years ago, ridiculously cheap, and that has been corrected,” Buffett said. “They’re probably more or less fairly priced now... We’re having a hard time finding things to buy.” Buffett had invested $5 billion in preferred stock of Goldman Sachs Group Inc and $3 billion in General Electric Co preferred stock at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. That gave him a reputation as a possible lender of last resort during times of stress.",9192013,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-bankofamerica/update-1-buffett-lauds-bernanke-but-laments-lack-of-investment-bargains-idUSL2N0HF29F20130919

514,BRKa,"US STOCKS-Futures higher, but investors still wary about shutdown","* U.S. government shutdown could hurt markets if prolonged * Wall Street coming off strong gains in September, third quarter * Berkshire to get nearly $2.15 billion in Goldman stock * Futures up: Dow 39 pts, S&P; 5 pts, Nasdaq 8.5 pts By Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK, Oct 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were higher on Tuesday, indicating a positive start to the fourth quarter, though concerns remained following a partial shutdown of the U.S. government. Congress missed a midnight deadline to agree on a spending bill, resulting in up to 1 million workers being put on unpaid leave. The release of the government’s report on construction spending in August, which had been scheduled for 10 a.m, has been delayed. “People expect this will be relatively short-term, with the impact hopefully minimal, but the longer it goes on, the more pressure Washington will face,” said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Banyan Partners LLC in New York. “If this lasts longer than a few days, you’ll really start to see volatility pick up.” Markets had maintained some hope that a shutdown could be avoided, and shares plummeted on Monday as the deadline approached without any stalemate being broken. However, some market participants viewed any pullback as a buying opportunity, and Monday’s early losses were trimmed. While an extended shutdown could weigh on economic growth and consumer confidence, a quick resolution may have limited impact. In addition, a resolution here could ease tensions for the congressional debate over the debt ceiling in mid-October. That issue, which could result in a default on U.S. debt if not resolved, is considered more serious for markets. “It was expected that the debt ceiling is when Republicans would circle their wagons; it is preferable that the budget battle be done now rather than there being a showdown over that,” said Pavlik. S&P; 500 futures rose 5 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures added 39 points and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 8.5 points. While the S&P; 500 traded under its 50-day moving average for much of Monday’s session, it recovered some of its losses late in the day and closed above the level, suggesting some near-term support. Equities have been strong performers recently, with major indexes climbing more than 2 percent in September. In the third quarter, the S&P; rose 4.7 percent and the Nasdaq soared 10.8 percent in its biggest quarterly gain since the first quarter of 2012. Walgreen Co reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations, helped by a rise in generic drug sales. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc will receive Goldman Sachs Inc stock worth nearly $2.15 billion on Tuesday through warrants acquired as part of a deal originally signed during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis. Cooper Tire and Rubber Co shareholders have approved the U.S. company’s $2.5 billion sale to India’s Apollo Tyres Ltd , clearing a major step for the creation of the world’s seventh biggest tyre maker. Overseas, tensions eased in Italy as dissent from within his People of Freedom Party complicated Silvio Berlusconi’s plans to bring down the coalition government of Prime Minister Enrico Letta. Data showing European factory activity grew for the third month in September also lent support to equities.

Buffett received the warrants five years ago when his investment in Goldman was seen as a vote of confidence in the bank, which was reeling from turmoil in the credit market. Under that deal, Berkshire had the right to buy about 43.5 million Goldman shares - or a roughly 9 percent stake then - at an exercise price of $115 per share, for $5 billion in total. Goldman announced an amended deal in March that would give Berkshire a much smaller stake but would not require it to commit any capital to exercise the warrants. Berkshire will convert the warrants into shares equal in value to the difference between the warrants’ exercise price and the average closing price for Goldman shares in the 10 trading days up to October 1. Based on the last 10-day share price average of $164.38, Berkshire would be entitled to about 13.1 million Goldman shares, making it the sixth largest external investor in the bank, according to Thomson Reuters data.

518,BRKa,Brothers to pay $5 million to settle Heinz insider-trading charges,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two brothers from Brazil will pay $5 million to settle civil charges that they reaped $1.8 million in illegal profits by trading ahead of an announcement that Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) and 3G Capital planned to acquire ketchup-maker H.J. Heinz, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Thursday. Earlier this year, the SEC froze their assets in a Swiss-based account after detecting suspicious options trading before the $28 billion deal was announced. At the time, their identities were unknown. The SEC said in its announcement Thursday the brothers used a family-owned Cayman Islands entity Alpine Swift to purchase $90,000 in options positions a day before the takeover was announced. After the announcement, the positions’ value increased 2000 percent. The Terpins brothers neither admitted nor denied the Securities and Exchange Commission’s charges. Lawyers for the two did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The SEC is alleging that Rodrigo Terpins placed the illegal trades while vacationing at Walt Disney World in Orlando after his brother passed along a tip about the acquisition. According to Thursday’s announcement the broker Terpins used to place the trades warned his firm had given Heinz a “sell” rating, but Terpins directed him to make the trades anyway. “Those who use foreign accounts to commit insider trading in the U.S. markets should know that their activities can still be tracked and they will be held accountable by the SEC for their actions,” said Sanjay Wadhwa, Senior Associate Director for Enforcement in the SEC’s New York Regional Office. The trades in question attracted a great deal of attention at the time of the Heinz takeover because they stood out plainly in the trading that took place ahead of the announcement. “The timing, size, and profitability of the trades as well as the lack of a prior history of Heinz trading in the Alpine Swift account made the transactions highly suspicious in the wake of the Heinz announcement, hence the SEC’s emergency action at the time,” the SEC said in its release on Thursday.

519,BRKa,Debt limit threat 'political weapon of mass destruction': Buffett,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, said Wednesday that the threat of not raising the U.S. debt ceiling is a “political weapon of mass destruction”. “It would be a colossal readjustment of the world if people lost faith in the United States government,” Buffett said in an interview with cable television network CNBC as negotiations continued in Washington over raising the $16.7 trillion U.S. borrowing limit. Buffett said a deal between Republican and Democratic lawmakers to raise the debt limit would likely be reached this week. If the debt ceiling is not raised, it could lead to the United States missing debt payments. Berkshire Hathaway owns short-term Treasury bills but Buffett said he was “not worried” about the bills being paid.

Berkshire owns more than 80 businesses in such areas as insurance, chemicals, railroads and clothing, and has more than $130 billion of equity and fixed income investments. Buffett said that his firm’s spending rate this year, particularly in reference to acquisitions, is as “high as ever,” and that it recently missed an “elephant”-sized buying opportunity worth more than $12 billion. He gave no further details. Berkshire Hathaway currently had about $40 billion in cash on hand, he said. Overall, stocks were still a better investment than long-term bonds but were not “selling at bubble levels”, Buffett said. The Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index has risen 19.1 percent this year.

521,BRKa,UPDATE 1-IMI to sell two non-core businesses to Berkshire's Marmon Group,"* Sells beverage dispense, merchandising units for $1.1 billion * Third-quarter revenue up 3 pct * Sees stronger fourth quarter * Says to meet full-year market expectations By Richa Naidu Oct 16 (Reuters) - Engineering company IMI Plc said it would sell its beverage dispense and merchandising businesses for 690 million pounds ($1.10 billion) to the Berkshire Hathaway-owned Marmon Group, in a bid to focus on the lucrative industrial end-markets of its core fluid power and severe service units. IMI’s beverage business, which makes valves for drink dispensers and accounts for about 14 percent of the company’s revenue, has been struggling as major customers have held back capital expenditure and deferred orders. “(The sale of beverage dispense) is a little bit of a surprise, but I think strategically makes sense and leaves them a much higher quality, more focussed industrial player going forward,” Peel Hunt analyst Dominic Convey said. He added that he is reviewing his rating on the stock. IMI said in March that it planned to sell most of its merchandising business, which makes marketing displays and accounts for just about 8 percent of its revenue. The company said it would return 620 million pounds from the sale to its shareholders, and put the remaining 70 million pounds into its pension fund. The sale is expected to be completed in early 2014. IMI, which also makes valves used in nuclear reactors, said its full-year results would meet market expectations, with a stronger second half offsetting its sluggish start to the year. Shares in the company were up 2.4 percent at 1535 pence at 0830 GMT on the London Stock Exchange. Third-quarter revenue rose 3 percent on an organic basis, with the return to growth of IMI’s fluid power business that caters to the food and beverage, rail, and life science industries.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch has valued the business at about 2 billion pounds ($3.20 billion). ** Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb has taken a position in Nokia, saying the Finnish communications and technology company is currently inexpensive and is poised to return a lot of cash to investors. ** Paradise Group, one of South Korea’s largest casino operators, and Japanese gaming company Sega Sammy  plan to invest $1.7 billion to build a luxury resort to tap a surge in Chinese gamblers flocking to the country. ** BHP Billiton Plc plans to sell roughly half its oil and gas acreage in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, an area revived by the shale boom, to focus on its most lucrative assets there. ** Newfield Exploration Co said it would sell its interests in Malaysia for $898 million as part of its plan to concentrate on its assets in the United States. ** The owners of broadcasting masts operator TDF SAS  are reviewing two bids for the group’s French unit that fell short of their 4 billion euros ($5.5 billion) expectations, said several sources involved with the process. ** Brazilian state-run energy company Petrobras joined forces with European oil majors and Chinese rivals on Monday to buy the country’s biggest-ever oil field with a lone bid at the minimum price, a worse-than-expected outcome for a sale designed to launch Brazil as a petroleum power. The consortium will be led by Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as Petrobras is formally known, and include France’s Total SA and Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell Plc. ** A Massachusetts judge has temporarily blocked the sale of The Boston Globe and Telegram & Gazette to Boston Red Sox owner John Henry because it could complicate a pending class action lawsuit, according to court documents. The New York Times Co had been due to seal the reported $70 million deal for the papers and related businesses with Henry on Friday, nearly three months after it was first announced. ** Spain’s Ferrovial SA has sold part of its stake in Heathrow Airport Holdings (HAH) to a British pensions group as part of a 392 million pound ($636 million) deal. ** U.S. software billionaire Bill Gates has bought 6 percent of Spanish construction company FCC for 113.5 million euros ($155 million), the company said in a statement on Monday. ** Serbia’s finance ministry said on Tuesday it plans to transfer assets of Privredna Banka Beograd to state-owned Postanska Stedionica, the second such takeover this year. ** Canada’s Methanex Corp agreed to sell a 10 percent stake in Egyptian methanol producer EMethanex to one of its joint venture partners Arab Petroleum Investments Corp (APICORP) for $110 million, APICORP said. ** Austrian insurance group Uniqa has agreed to buy insurance companies in Croatia and Serbia from Switzerland’s Baloise for 75 million euros ($103 million), it said. The acquisition of the Basler companies will boost Uniqa’s market position, particularly in Croatia, the company said. ** Italy’s Eni SPA is talking with German utility EnBW over the future of their gas grid joint venture in Germany, the company said, as speculation rises the oil and gas group could sell its stake. ** Poland’s No. 1 telecoms group TPSA received three offers in the tender for its Web arm and Poland’s No. 2 Internet portal Wp.pl, TPSA’s chief financial officer said.

523,BRKa,Berkshire third-quarter profit up 29 percent; operating results miss,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) posted a 29 percent jump in third-quarter profit as it recorded big gains on investments made during the financial crisis, but operating results missed forecasts amid weakness in insurance operations. Quarterly results included $1.4 billion of gains from investments that Buffett made in October 2008, including in General Electric Co (GE.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) warrants, and bonds related to candy maker Mars Inc’s purchase of rival Wrigley. Such investments helped give Buffett a reputation as a lender of last resort. But investment and derivative gains do not factor into operating results, and while profit rose at Berkshire’s Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad and MidAmerican energy and utility units, insurance underwriting results deteriorated. Net income rose to $5.05 billion, or $3,074 per Class A share, from $3.92 billion, or $2,373 per share, a year earlier, Berkshire said on Friday. Operating profit rose just 8 percent to $3.66 billion, or $2,228 per Class A share, from $3.4 billion, or $2,057 per share. Analysts on average expected $2,402 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Michael Yoshikami, president of Destination Wealth Management in Walnut Creek, California, which invests $1.3 billion and owns Berkshire stock, said the company can boost investment results if bond yields rise once the U.S. Federal Reserve pulls back on efforts to prop up the nation’s economy. “The U.S. economy is rather stumbling, and that is positive actually for their infrastructure investments such as railroads,” he said. “All things considered, we are fairly pleased with the results.” Book value, Buffett’s preferred measure of the Omaha, Nebraska-based company’s worth, rose 11 percent this year to $126,766 per Class A share as of September 30, 2013. Net insurance underwriting premiums fell 57 percent to $170 million. Results weakened at the Geico auto insurance unit, which paid out a higher percentage of premiums to cover claims than a year earlier, and the General Re reinsurance unit, which had a $400 million underwriting loss from a European hailstorm. In addition, Berkshire’s main reinsurance business sustained a $206 million pre-tax underwriting loss, hurt by lower premiums and currency fluctuations. Profit rose about 6 percent at Burlington Northern to $989 million, as higher shipments of industrial products, consumer products and coal offset a drop for agricultural products amid lower grain exports and strong global competition. Results also improved in businesses such as the Forest River recreational vehicle unit. Revenue from jewelry, home furnishings and other retail businesses rose 18 percent. Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, which invests 3 percent of its $700 million of assets in Berkshire, said the 83-year-old Buffett is setting up the company to perform over the long haul. “He’s making a big push into almost everything associated with the idea that we’ll build a lot more homes in the next 10 years,” Smead said. Berkshire ended the quarter with $42.08 billion of cash and equivalents, giving Buffett the firepower to make one or more large acquisitions, which he calls “elephants.” The second-richest American wants to keep about $20 billion in cash, in part for possible insurance payouts on storms. Berkshire bought $1.77 billion worth of stock during the quarter but sold $1.48 billion, and was actually a bigger net purchaser of bonds than stocks. Buffett has run Berkshire since 1965, favoring businesses with consistent earnings power. Berkshire now has more than 80 businesses, though it remains best known for insurance. He spent $12.3 billion in June to buy part of ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co. Berkshire also owns $104.9 billion in equities, including such stocks as Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N). In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares closed up $127.70 at $173,122.50, while its Class B shares rose 19 cents to $115.27. Berkshire released results after U.S. markets closed. Its B shares fell 0.7 percent to $114.51 after hours.

524,BRKa,UPDATE 2-Buffett's Berkshire buys sizable new Exxon Mobil stake,"* $3.45 billion stake disclosed in Exxon * Exxon shares have lagged market, rise after-hours   (Adds analyst comments, other holdings) By Jonathan Stempel and Luciana Lopez Nov 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc   on Thursday disclosed a new $3.45 billion stake in Exxon Mobil Corp, after buying 40.1 million shares in the world’s largest publicly traded oil company. Although the investment represents just 0.9 percent of Houston-based Exxon’s shares, analysts said it reflects strong support by the second-richest American of one of the world’s largest and most profitable companies. “When Warren Buffett gives his seal of approval to any company, that is never a bad thing,” said Pavel Molchanov, energy analyst at Raymond James & Associates, who rates Exxon shares a “strong buy.” Exxon shares rose 84 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $94.06 in after-hours trading following Berkshire’s disclosure of its stake in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that listed most of its equity investments as of Sept. 30. The shares had risen 63 cents during regular trading. “He likes buying big, established global brand names, and Exxon is a good flight-to-quality stock,” said Fadel Gheit, senior oil analyst at Oppenheimer & Co, referring to Buffett.     “The stock has also lagged the market in the last three and five years. That makes it a typical Warren Buffett holding.” Gheit has a “perform” rating on Exxon. Berkshire already has energy and utilities businesses, including MidAmerican Energy, which is spending $5.6 billion to buy Nevada utility NV Energy Inc. U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter, and the disclosures can offer a window into their strategies for buying and selling stocks. Buffett sometimes gets SEC permission to delay disclosures so that he can buy stocks without having investors copy him. He did this for the second quarter of 2013, and revealed on Thursday that Exxon purchases took place during that period. “We appreciate the confidence investors have in ExxonMobil when they decide to invest in the company,” Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said in an email. Berkshire last reported owning Exxon shares in late 2011. Debbie Bosanek, an assistant to Buffett, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Buffett typically makes Berkshire’s largest investments, while other investments are made by portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Berkshire’s quarterly filings do not reveal who buys or sells what. The company ended September with $104.9 billion of equities. Its four top holdings - American Express Co, Coca-Cola Co, International Business Machines Corp and Wells Fargo & Co - totaled $58.4 billion. During the quarter, Berkshire also reduced by 44 percent its share stake in oil company ConocoPhillips. Through Thursday, ConocoPhillips’ stock was up 27.1 percent in 2013, while Exxon rose just 7.7 percent. The Energy Selector Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund was up 22.1 percent. “Buffett is a classic value investor, and Exxon has been an underloved stock in a bull market,” Molchanov said. “Exxon is an amazing cash generating machine, which should generate $16 billion of free cash flow this year.” Berkshire also reported higher stakes in Bank of New York Mellon Corp, dialysis clinic operator DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc, satellite TV provider DIRECTV, Suncor Energy Co, US Bancorp and Verisign Inc , which assigns Internet protocol addresses. Its stake in drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc fell. Berkshire also owns more than 80 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, utilities, chemicals and food. It paid $12.3 billion in June for half of ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co. On Thursday, Berkshire’s Class A shares rose 0.7 percent to $173,320, and its Class B shares rose 0.8 percent to $115.69.

As executive chairman, Rose, 54, will work on activities including organizational planning, market positioning and public policy at BNSF over the next decade, the company said on Wednesday. Carl Ice, 57, will replace Rose as chief executive at the nation’s largest railroad, beginning January 1. Ice has been at the railroad for 34 years, and has been president of BNSF since November 2010. “Buffett has a track record of retaining good executives for long periods of times, and this will potentially free up Matt Rose to assist with other projects with Berkshire as warranted,” said James Armstrong, president of Henry H.

Berkshire has been preparing to eventually replace Buffett, 83, considered by many to be one of the greatest investors ever, for many years. And questions about succession for Buffett, the second-richest American, have picked up in recent years as he has aged and battled prostate cancer.

Berkshire bought the roughly 77 percent of the former Burlington Northern Santa Fe Co it did not already own for $26.5 billion in 2010. In this year’s third quarter, the railroad posted a $989 million profit, about 20 percent of Berkshire’s $5.05 billion. “BNSF’s performance has far exceeded the high expectations I had at the time of Berkshire’s purchase,” Buffett said in a statement. “The combination of Matt’s and Carl’s talents is the perfect arrangement for the future.

Buffett, through an assistant, did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. Considered one of the world’s greatest investors, Buffett is now 83 and Berkshire has been preparing for many years for his eventual departure from the company he has run since 1965. Speculation about who could succeed the second-richest American have picked up in recent years as Buffett has aged and survived prostate cancer. Berkshire plans to split Buffett’s role in three, with one person serving as chief executive, Buffett’s son Howard as non-executive chairman, and one or more others as chief investment officer. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company has more than 80 units selling such things as Russell athletic apparel, Geico car insurance, chemicals and furniture. It also owns dozens of newspapers, including the Omaha World-Herald. Buffett has said that he and Berkshire’s board are in agreement on who would step in as chief executive when the need arises, but has not yet publicly identified that person. He has said Berkshire has three internal candidates, all men. Investors have speculated that other candidates could be insurance chief Ajit Jain, MidAmerican Energy chief Greg Abel, or perhaps portfolio manager Ted Weschler. Some have also mentioned Geico’s Tony Nicely, but he is older than the others. “Rose is young and talented, and when you’re young and talented, you’re not looking for ways to do less,” said Thomas Russo, a partner at Gardner Russo & Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. “He may have to do less on a daily basis at Burlington, which would free up his time to work on other things at Berkshire.” Russo helps invest more than $6 billion, of which more that 10 percent is in Berkshire. The Burlington transition is similar to what occurred at MidAmerican Energy in 2008, when David Sokol became chairman, and Abel replaced him as chief executive. Sokol was also considered a candidate to succeed Buffett as Berkshire chief executive. He left the company abruptly in 2011 amid questions about a personal investment in a chemicals company he was negotiating for Berkshire to buy.

Net income attributable to Jefferies rose to $120 million from $71.6 million a year earlier, while revenue from investment banking rose about 48 percent to $417 million. Net revenue rose to $935.7 million from $768.9 million.

The year has seen some blockbuster deals, with merger and acquisition activity across the globe rising to $1.55 trillion up to the end of the third quarter. Jefferies, which kicks off the reporting season for investment banks, is often viewed as an indicator of performance at Wall Street banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley. Leucadia, which models itself on Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and owns companies ranging from real estate to mining, paid $2.76 billion in stock for the 71 percent of Jefferies it did not already own in November last year.

Shares of Exxon closed up nearly 3 percent at $99.54 on Wednesday, surpassing the previous all-time closing high of $98.87 reached earlier this week. Since reporting its third-quarter results on Oct. 31, Exxon shares have risen 11 percent, outperforming a 5 percent decline in the SIG oil and gas company index. At that time, Exxon indicated its capital expenditures may subside next year after planned spending of $41 billion this year, a move seen freeing up more cash for shareholders. The company also said it expects to spend $3 billion on share repurchases this quarter, an amount that equaled those made in the third quarter.

Phillips 66 said on Monday that Berkshire will pay for the unit, Phillips Specialty Products Inc, using about 19 million shares of Phillips 66 stock that it currently owns. “I have long been impressed by the strength of the Phillips 66 business portfolio,” Buffett said in a statement. “The flow improver business is a high-quality business with consistently strong financial performance.” The exact number of shares Berkshire will pay for the unit will be determined by their price on the closing date, the companies said. James Hambrick, CEO of Berkshire’s specialty chemicals unit Lubrizol Corp, will oversee the business, Buffett said. Berkshire bought Lubrizol for about $9 billion in 2011. Phillips 66 CEO Greg Garland said the company decided to sell the business because Berkshire Hathaway made a strong offer. He said the company will now focus its growth on its oil and natural gas transportation and processing business, as well as its other chemicals businesses. Phillips 66 said it expects the Phillips Specialty Products unit to have about $450 million of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet at closing. It expects the deal to close in the first half of 2014. Berkshire favors larger companies with consistent earnings power and easy-to-understand businesses. In June, it paid $12.3 billion for half of ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co, and in May said it paid $2.05 billion for the 20 percent it did not already own of Israeli toolmaker Iscar. Earlier this month, Berkshire’s MidAmerican Energy unit paid $5.6 billion for the Nevada utility NV Energy Inc. Omaha, Neb.-based Berkshire still has the capacity to make one or more large purchases, which Buffett calls “elephants.” Berkshire ended September with $42.08 billion of cash and equivalents, and generates significant cash from the insurance operations for which it is perhaps best known.

The S&P; 500 is up 29.5 percent for the year and all 10 sector indexes will end the year in positive territory. The Dow is up 26 percent, as investors rode the Federal Reserve’s extraordinary stimulus and expectations for improved growth in a year that had only the slightest of hiccups. The Fed recently announced it will trim its monthly bond purchases in response to an improving economic picture, but that has still not deterred equities. The Nasdaq is up 38.2 percent for the year, setting the technology-heavy index up for its best yearly performance since 2009. Trading volume was once again light in U.S. markets, which will be closed Wednesday for the New Year’s holiday. As the year draws to a close, the S&P; 500’s 117 percent gain dating to Barack Obama’s 2009 inauguration is the second-best gain during the first five years of any president’s time in office, based on figures dating to the 1930s. The S&P; rose 123 percent between Bill Clinton’s 1993 inauguration and the end of 1997. The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer confidence rose to 78.1 from an upwardly revised 72.0 in November and above the expected 76.0 reading. “The market was kind of flat until the pieces of economic data came out, none of which were particularly exceptional, but it seemed to drive more buying,” said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. Data earlier in the day showed that the S&P;/Case-Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas gained 0.2 percent in October from September, but posted the strongest annualized gain in October in more than seven years. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 49.36 points or 0.30 percent, to 16,553.65. The S&P; 500 gained 5.27 points or 0.29 percent, to 1,846.34.

545,BRKa,"Railcars in North Dakota crude train crash older, less safe -investigators","* Railcars don’t meet industry’s latest safety standards * Crude loaded in North Dakota, bound for Missouri By Alicia Underlee Nelson FARGO, N.D., Dec 31 (Reuters) - The railcars carrying crude oil that crashed into a derailed grain train in North Dakota on Monday were all older types that do not meet the latest industry safety standards, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board said on Tuesday. Robert Sumwalt, who is leading the NTSB’s investigation into the collision of two BNSF Railway Co trains, said the cylindrical tank cars on the oil train were known as DOT-111s, which are widely used to move crude and ethanol. In October 2011, the American Association of Railroads, the rail industry’s trade group, adopted new standards requiring tank cars manufactured after that date to have thicker hulls and reinforced valves to better protect against punctures and leaks in derailments. U.S. regulators also are considering tougher safety standards. “Our preliminary information is that none of the cars were of the newer design,” Sumwalt said at a news conference in Fargo, North Dakota, east of the crash site. Those details go to the heart of growing debate about stronger safety measures as the oil-by-rail movement grows in tandem with the U.S. shale oil boom. Such measures could include tighter rules for moving highly flammable types of crude, such as the light-sweet variety produced in the Bakken shale play, or costly retrofits of older tank railcars. Monday’s crash of the 106-car eastbound BNSF crude train into a derailed westbound BNSF grain train set off explosions near a small town west of Fargo, North Dakota, and a fire that still burned more than 24 hours later. No injuries were reported, but the crash was among several explosive derailments in 2013 involving trains hauling oil. The worst accident by far happened in July in a small Quebec town when a runaway train derailed and exploded, killing 47 people. The NTSB has said at least 69 percent of railcars in use were built before 2011. The rail industry also has said it could cost $1 billion to retrofit all those railcars to meet the post-October 2011 standard. BNSF Chief Executive Officer Matt Rose, who is stepping down as CEO on Wednesday but will remain chairman, told Reuters in an interview in November that the company supports phasing out those older cars over seven years, which allows companies enough time to build replacements. BNSF is owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc . 1300-MILE TRIP Sumwalt said the crude involved in the crash was loaded onto the train in Fryburg, North Dakota, and was headed nearly 1,300 miles (2,092 km) to Hayti, Missouri. Sources familiar with the loading operations told Reuters on Tuesday that Houston-based logistics company Great Northern Midstream loaded the crude at Fryburg, and it was to be unloaded at Marquis Energy’s storage terminal and barge loading facility at Hayti, along the Mississippi River. Great Northern Midstream referred all questions to the NTSB, and Marquis Energy did not return a call seeking comment. Both companies are privately held. Marquis Energy’s Hayti operation receives crude via rail, then transports it via barge to refiners along the river and the U.S. Gulf Coast. The U.S. East and West coasts are the major destinations for railed Bakken crude, as it is cheaper than imports and rail is the main transport choice because pipeline infrastructure is lacking. The U.S. Gulf Coast market has less demand for Bakken crude because growing pipeline infrastructure in Texas increasingly moves burgeoning Texas output - also largely light sweet crudes that are cheaper than imports - to Gulf Coast refineries.",1012014,http://www.reuters.com/article/northdakota-derailment-energy/railcars-in-north-dakota-crude-train-crash-older-less-safe-investigators-idUSL2N0KB01920140101
546,BRKa,Berkshire owns over one-fourth of USG Corp after crisis-era bet,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N)(BRKb.N) has converted much of its debt in building products company USG Corp (USG.N) into more than $600 million of common stock in a successful investment made in the wake of the financial crisis. According to regulatory filings on Tuesday and Thursday, Berkshire acquired 21.39 million USG shares last month by exchanging $243.8 million of convertible notes it held in Chicago-based USG. That boosted its USG stake to 38.46 million shares, or more than 27 percent, worth $1.09 billion as of Tuesday’s close. The stake makes Berkshire the largest shareholder of USG. It could rise above 30 percent if Berkshire was to swap its remaining $56.2 million of USG notes, a filing shows. Shares of USG rose 0.7 percent to $28.60 on Thursday. A USG spokesman declined to comment on Berkshire’s stake. He said USG has roughly 139 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis following last month’s redemption. Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, and Canada’s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd (FFH.TO) in late 2008 acquired $400 million of USG convertible senior notes in a private placement. With that deal and others in the same time period, Berkshire gained a reputation as a lender of last resort when financial markets come under strain. The USG notes had a 10 percent interest rate, the same that Berkshire got when it invested $8 billion in Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and General Electric Co (GE.N). Berkshire also bought $300 million of senior notes with a 15 percent rate from motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N). USG last month redeemed $325 million of the notes at a premium, and Berkshire exercised its right to swap its securities into USG common stock at just $11.40 per share. As of September 30, Berkshire held 15.7 percent of USG’s common stock, regulatory filings show. That percentage reflects USG’s lower number of shares outstanding at the time.

The company said in an advisory to customers that it reopened one track at 3 a.m. CST (0900 GMT) and the other at 3:15 a.m. on Thursday. BNSF said customers might experience delays of up to 36 hours on shipments through that corridor. A 106-car eastbound BNSF train carrying crude oil crashed into a railcar of a derailed westbound BNSF grain train from an opposing track on Monday, setting off explosions and a fire that burned for more than 24 hours, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. No injuries were reported. The NTSB is investigating the incident. BNSF, owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc , had been rerouting trains while the tracks were closed since Monday. Some oil trains were being routed through Sheridan, Wyoming, while some coal and merchandise trains were rerouted from Aberdeen, South Dakota, to Laurel, Montana. BNSF spokesman Steven Forsberg said on Thursday that some trains were still being rerouted, as “it will take time to get traffic flows back to normal on the route involving the derailment.” The train crashed just west of Casselton, North Dakota, which is about 25 miles (40 km) west of Fargo at the North Dakota/Minnesota state line.",1022014,http://www.reuters.com/article/northdakota-derailment/update-1-bnsf-railway-reopens-tracks-after-train-crash-idUSL2N0KC0KM20140102

550,BRKa,UPDATE 1-Regulator: 18 of 20 oil cars pierced in N. Dakota crash,"By Brendan O’Brien Jan 13 (Reuters) - Eighteen of 20 tanker cars carrying oil that derailed in the fiery crash of two trains in North Dakota in late December were punctured, spilling more than 400,000 gallons of crude oil, safety regulators reported on Monday. In a preliminary report, the National Transportation Safety Board said the oil train heading east struck a derailed car from a westbound grain train, leading to the derailment and fire about a mile (1.6 km) outside the small town of Casselton, North Dakota, on Dec. 30. Both trains were operated by BNSF Railway Co, more than 100 cars long each and were traveling well below the posted 65-mile-per-hour speed limit, the NTSB report said. BNSF is owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. The grain train was traveling at 28 mph (45 km per hour) and the oil train at 43 mph (69 kph) when emergency braking systems were applied on both trains, the report said. A series of powerful explosions and fireballs followed the collision, with the blaze creating plumes of thick, black smoke that passed over Casselton, forcing about 1,400 people in the area from their homes. No injuries were reported. The incident caused about $6.1 million in damage, according to the NTSB report. A broken axle and two wheels were shipped to the NTSB laboratory in Washington for further evaluation, as were locomotive event and video recorders, the agency said. “Thankfully, no one was hurt, but this accident underscores the need to work to prevent derailments in the first place, and to upgrade the tanker fleet to reduce the risk of fires and explosions if an accident does occur,” U.S. Senator John Hoeven, a North Dakota Republican, said in a statement. Hoeven said he reviewed the preliminary report and called on the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to issue new standards for tanker car construction. The crash came five months after a runaway oil train carrying Bakken crude derailed and exploded in the center of the Quebec town of Lac Megantic, killing 47 people. The incident fueled a drive for tougher standards for such shipments, including potentially costly retrofits to improve the safety of tank cars that regulators have cited as prone to puncture. In early November, two dozen cars on another 90-car oil train derailed in rural Alabama, erupting into flames that took several days to extinguish. The Association of American Railroads recently proposed costly fixes to older tank cars that do not meet its latest standards, but continue to carry hazardous fuels such as oil. The fixes include protective steel jackets, thermal protection and pressure relief valves, which could cost billions of dollars. Oil shippers, likely to be saddled with the costs of retrofits, oppose some of the changes proposed by the association.",1132014,http://www.reuters.com/article/northdakota-derailment/update-1-regulator-18-of-20-oil-cars-pierced-in-n-dakota-crash-idUSL2N0KN2AU20140113

Rating agency Moody’s Investors Service has put Fosun’s debt under review for a possible downgrade, citing uncertainties over its funding plan for the purchase of the insurance unit of Caixa Geral de Depositos SA CGDES.UL which comes after a series of investments last year. Liang Xinjun, chief executive of Fosun, declined to disclose its funding plan for the deal, but said the company has enough cash on hand to pay for it. “Our own balance sheet is fully capable of paying for it, but we will also consider other funding channels,” he told Reuters in an interview, adding the firm saw strong growth in profit last year which will help its balance sheet. The 2013 financial results have not yet been published. Fosun had 20 billion yuan ($3.31 billion) in cash as of 2012 and 10 billion yuan of securities assets which it could sell if needed, Liang said. Liang was speaking after announcing a plan to launch a real estate joint venture with Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N) which will target urban projects in China. The companies did not give a size for their investment, but said without elaborating that they also expect to work together on real estate projects outside of China. The real estate venture is the latest move by Fosun which is aiming to become a Chinese version of Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) by using insurance investments as a base to fund long-term investments in larger companies. Fosun’s chairman, Guo Guangchang, said the Prudential deal “marks a solid step for Fosun to develop Warren Buffet’s model.

556,BRKa,"U.S. judge takes on SEC again, questions Heinz insider trading pact","NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - A federal judge who has questioned the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s practice of settling cases without admissions of wrongdoing is raising concerns about a proposed agreement over insider trading in H.J. Heinz Co. Concerns voiced by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff were detailed by the SEC in a court filing in New York federal court Thursday as it seeks approval of a $5 million settlement with two brothers from Brazil. The SEC said that in November, Rakoff questioned the agency’s decision to allow the brothers to settle while neither admitting nor denying the charges. Despite a revision to the settlement, the judge has continued to raise issues, the SEC said. The dispute, which has not been previously reported, came despite a new settlement policy ushered in by SEC Chair Mary Jo White in June that would require defendants in some cases to make admissions, in contrast to letting them resolve lawsuits without admitting or denying the charges. The shift followed a public debate over the practice prompted in large part by Rakoff, who in 2011 refused to approve the SEC’s $285 million financial crisis-related settlement with Citigroup Inc. Rakoff at the time said he had no way to know if the accord was in the public interest. The SEC is awaiting a decision by 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on whether it will reverse the judge. The commission’s latest run-in with Rakoff came in lawsuit filed in February 2013 initially against unknown traders in H.K. Heinz over suspicious trades ahead of the announcement that the ketchup maker would be acquired for $23 billion by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and Brazil’s 3G Capital. In October, the SEC filed an amended complaint while simultaneously settling with the two brothers in Brazil now named in the case, Michel Terpins and Rodrigo Terpins. The SEC said the brothers had used a family-owned Cayman Islands entity called Alpine Swift to buy $90,000 in options positions a day before the takeover was announced. After the deal became public, the positions’ jumped in value by 2000 percent, the SEC said. As part of the settlement, the Terpins agreed to forfeit all $1.81 million in profits made from trading Heinz options and also pay $3 million in penalties. Neither brother admitted nor denied the charges as part of the settlement as initially drafted. No transcripts exist of the calls between Rakoff and the parties where the SEC said he raised his concerns. But from the start, Rakoff’s only concern was the inclusion of the no-admit, no-deny language, the SEC said. The SEC said that after further negotiations, it submitted on Dec. 26 revised proposed consent judgments for Rakoff’s approval that dropped the language. But the proposed judgments contained clauses that made clear that the lack of the language didn’t constitute an admission, the SEC said. Rakoff on a Dec. 31 call expressed continued concerns and gave the parties three options, the SEC said: remove the new clauses, require the brothers to admit to the allegations for the limited purpose of the proceedings, or have an evidentiary hearing. On a call that followed on Jan. 9, Rakoff ordered the SEC to submit a court filing providing the evidence supporting its claims. Rakoff had required a similar filing in the Citigroup case as well. In Thursday’s filing, which provided that evidence, the SEC said the settlements with the brothers “reflect a fair, adequate, and reasonable resolution of this matter.” Dwight Bostwick, a lawyer for Michel Terpins, declined comment. A lawyer for Rodrigo Terpins did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the SEC also declined comment. The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v.

557,BRKa,Berkshire in talks with Graham to trade shares for new unit,"(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc said it was in talks with Graham Holdings Co, formerly The Washington Post Co, to trade the shares it owns in the education and media company for control of a yet-to-be-formed unit of Graham. Berkshire Hathaway owns about 1.7 million of Graham's Class B stock, according to a regulatory filing. (r.reuters.com/dex76v) Berkshire said the new unit would own a business and certain other assets of the company that it did not identify. The Washington Post Co changed its name to Graham Holdings on November 29, 2013, after selling its newspaper publishing business to Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos in October for $250 million. Graham Holdings provides educational services through its subsidiary, Kaplan Inc, and its media operations comprise ownership of cable television systems through its unit, Cable One, and six television broadcast stations. It also owns and operates online magazine Slate and Foreign Policy magazine. It was not immediately clear whether the new unit would be a part of either of these businesses. A spokesperson for Graham Holdings declined to comment, while Berkshire Hathaway officials were not available for comment outside normal working hours. Shares of Graham Holdings closed at $654.35 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

560,BRKa,Greenberg channels Buffett in post-AIG comeback,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Since his ouster from American International Group Inc (AIG.N) in 2005, Maurice “Hank” Greenberg has been quietly building an insurance and investment conglomerate that people close to him describe as a mini version of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N). Greenberg’s $4.4 billion acquisition, announced Monday, of health insurance claims processor MultiPlan Inc is by far the largest in a series of investments carried out through the private investments arm of his insurance and investment firm, C.V. Starr & Co, which was set up by AIG founder Cornelius Vander Starr in 1943. The MultiPlan deal could be the clearest sign yet of how Greenberg, 88, has been working on a Wall Street comeback after spending the last few years dealing with a multitude of lawsuits and investigations while suffering huge losses in the value of his AIG holdings as the insurance giant tottered during the financial crisis. Although Greenberg’s closely held company does not disclose financial details, people familiar with the matter said its private investments arm, Starr Investment Holdings LLC, had more than $3 billion in assets under management. It is tiny compared with Berkshire Hathaway, which has a market value of $283 billion. In the MultiPlan deal, Greenberg deployed some of the same tactics as Buffett - using cash flow from a set of operating companies and assets as well as his relationships to pull off a large deal. “We have a rapidly growing insurance arm, we have a real estate business, and we also have a unit that helps Chinese companies invest in the U.S.,” Greenberg said in an interview. “We are private, we don’t advertise what we are doing, and we will stay private,” added Greenberg, who described the private investments arm as a significant driver of earnings. Greenberg, who - according to Forbes - had a net worth of $3.2 billion around the time he was ousted as AIG boss, last year told talk show host Charlie Rose he had lost around 90 percent of his wealth as a result of AIG’s collapse. AIG shares are still trading at a tiny fraction of their pre-crisis levels. Leading Starr Investment Holdings is Geoff Clark, already a veteran private equity dealmaker at the age of 41. After co-founding Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s (GS.N) private equity group in 1996 and being its co-head until 2004, Clark joined Starr in 2007, at a time when it invested in private equity funds but also made direct private equity investments. He led Starr Investment Holdings as it launched as a dedicated private investments business in 2012 and adopted an investment horizon that can go beyond the typical five-to-seven-year period that buyout firms tend to hold companies before selling them or doing an initial public offering. Rather than manage a traditional private equity fund that raises money from investors and then decides how to invest it, Starr Investment Holdings reaches out to investors on a deal-by-deal basis to seek their participation. Greenberg brought Swiss alternative asset manager Partners Group Holding AG (PGHN.S) and three other investors into the MultiPlan deal. The identity of the other investors, and information about the size of their stakes, was not disclosed but a person familiar with the deal said they included Bill Gross’ Pacific Investment Management Co, the world’s largest bond fund manager. A Pimco spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. “Mr Greenberg was very involved on the Starr side,” Joel Schwartz, Partners Group managing director, said in an interview. “We met with him during the deal, but we really did the transaction with Starr Investment Holdings.” Last year, Starr Investment Holdings brought in Partners Group as a shareholder in home decoration retailer Garden Ridge, a portfolio company of private equity firm AEA Investors LP. Starr, which was already a Garden Ridge investor, invited Partners Group into the deal when some of the other shareholders decided to exit. Greenberg’s links to the insurance world proved crucial to the MultiPlan deal, both in terms of relationships and also understanding MultiPlan’s business and clientele, people who worked on the deal said. MultiPlan Chief Executive Mark Tabak, who Starr and Partners Group plan to keep at the company’s helm, worked for Greenberg between 1993 and 1996 as president of AIG Managed Care. “We have known each other for a long time. He was a very key player, we probably would not have done (the MultiPlan deal) without him and he would not have done it without us,” Greenberg said of Tabak. MultiPlan is the oldest and largest provider of cost management solutions for the U.S. healthcare industry. The company’s cash flow has increased 50 percent since 2010 and Moody’s Investors Service said this week that MultiPlan continues to be in a market with high barriers to entry and solid organic growth. Greenberg had served as AIG chief executive for almost four decades when he was forced to step down amid an investigation by Eliot Spitzer, then the New York Attorney General, into the company’s business practices. The following year, the insurer paid $1.64 billion to settle federal and state probes. Greenberg still faces some New York state charges over allegedly sham transactions, which he vehemently denies doing. Last year, he sued Spitzer for defamation as the former New York state governor was trying to stage his own comeback.

562,BRKa,Exclusive: BNSF to move into tank car ownership with safer oil fleet,"HOUSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - BNSF Railway Co plans to move into tank car ownership and buy its own fleet of up to 5,000 new crude oil tank cars with safety features that exceed the latest industry standards, the unit of investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) said on Thursday. The unusual step by one of the largest U.S. railroads aims to reduce the risks of moving crude by rail after several recent accidents, including one involving a BNSF train in North Dakota in December. The company, a major mover of crude by rail throughout the United States, plans to seek bids from railcar makers for up to 5,000 new tank cars with thicker walls and ends, increased protection of safety and pressure valves, and other features that go beyond industry standards adopted two years ago. The news sent shares of several U.S. railcar makers higher. Railroads like BNSF generally own only the tracks and locomotives that pull trains. Railcars are usually owned by leasing companies or firms such as refiners that sometimes buy cars for their own fleets. In some cases, shippers buy railcars, sell them to leasing companies, and then lease them back. The December crash of a BNSF crude train in North Dakota involved railcars that did not meet industry safety standards, according to investigators. The train collided with a derailed grain train, setting off fires that burned for more than a day. No one was hurt. Crude-carrying tank cars built after October 2011 are based on stronger design standards recommended by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) trade group. Those design standards feature stronger hulls and reinforced valves less likely to puncture or leak in a derailment. The U.S. Transportation Department’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration is considering new rules for safer tank cars as crude transport via rail surges in tandem with the booming onshore oil production in the United States and Canada. Last week, Canadian National Railway Co (CNR.TO) and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CP.TO) said they would charge higher rates for customers that move crude in railcars built before October 2011, which the National Transportation Safety Board said in 2009 were unsafe. BNSF declined to comment on possible pricing to shippers opting to use the railroad’s tank cars once they are built, saying such information is proprietary. Other U.S. railroads also declined to comment last week on the Canadian railroads’ decision to charge shippers more for using older tank cars. BNSF’s plan to move into tank car ownership and the Canadian railroads’ pricing decisions to push shippers to use newer railcars all come before U.S. regulators have issued any new safety standards. BNSF did not identify railcar makers that it will invite to bid, but manufacturers in the United States include Trinity Industries Inc (TRN.N), American Railcar Industries Inc (ARII.O) and Greenbrier Cos Inc (GBX.N). Shares of American Railcar rose as much as 15 percent, while Trinity jumped 10 percent and Greenbrier climbed 6 percent. A Trinity said it would look at BNSF’s needs. Earlier this month, before saying it would take bids for new oil railcars, BNSF said it would spend $1.6 billion this year on locomotive, freight car and other equipment purchases. That was part of a $1 billion increase in its annual capital budget to $5 billion. BNSF did not say when it expects to take delivery of the cars. American Railcar Industries said on Thursday that its tank railcar manufacturing unit was maxed out, though Greenbrier recently said it had capacity for more work. Rapid proliferation of moving oil by train started more than three years ago, with shipments surpassing 780,000 barrels a day in 2013 - a 71 percent jump from 2012, according to AAR. The growth resulted from a lack of pipeline infrastructure to move burgeoning inland output to refining markets, particularly on the U.S. West and East coasts, where refiners were otherwise highly dependent on more expensive imports. Refiners with coastal plants have heavily embraced oil by train, building offloading facilities to receive it. BNSF moves more crude from North Dakota’s Bakken shale than its peers. However, crude via rail has come under intense scrutiny from regulators after multiple crashes, particularly those that involved pre-October 2011 older railcars without reinforcements. AAR in November issued stronger recommendations, including the addition of reclosing high-pressure relief valves, metal jackets and full-height head shields. The Railway Supply Institute, a lobbying group that represents tank car manufacturers, last week proposed requirements that are essentially the same as AAR’s. The worst oil-by-rail accident happened last July when a runaway Montreal Maine & Atlantic Railway train carrying Bakken crude crashed in a small Quebec town, causing explosions and fires that killed 47 people and obliterated half of the main downtown strip. Other accidents that did not cause deaths followed. In addition to considering stricter standards for tank cars, U.S. regulators are studying the volatility of lighter crude like that produced in the Bakken that moves via rail. Such light crudes are considered by experts to be more dangerous than Canadian heavy crude because they contain more light ends - such as propane and butane - that can catch fire and explode amid sparks that fly in a crash. In January, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx met with railroads and shippers to look at railcar safety issues, train speeds and rail inspections. At the time, he asked them to respond with ideas in 30 days. On Thursday, he emphasized there were no quick fixes. “We are not going to figure this entire issue out in 30-days,” Foxx told reporters. “There is going to be a much longer-term look at how we strengthen our safety measures for the movement of crude oil in our country, but we also recognize there is some goodwill in getting some voluntary measures done.” Some refiners are not waiting to switch to newer railcars. Phillips 66’s (PSX.N) crude tank car fleet consists entirely of post-October 2011 cars, and some others are phasing out older DOT-111s. PBF Energy Inc (PBF.N) last week said it will rely on entirely newer railcars by April 1 - much faster than previous estimates of the end of 2014. Canadian refiner Irving Oil, the destination for the crude on the train that crashed in Quebec last year, said on Monday it would replace all pre-October 2011 railcars in its fleet with the newer design by the end of April. Tesoro Corp TSO.N is replacing the last older cars in its fleet by mid-summer, and Valero Energy Corp, the largest U.S. refiner, has ordered more than 5,300 newer cars.

Tamraz referenced a Wall Street Journal article earlier in the month that noted the difference in profits that milliseconds can make to traders who use sophisticated technology to execute ultra-fast orders. Critics have pointed the finger at such high-frequency trading for volatile market moves, such as the “flash crash,” or abrupt plunge in shares, in 2010. But supporters of high-frequency trading say it adds liquidity to markets. Tamraz defended the practice, but noted the potential for reputational damage nonetheless. “As the recent Wall Street Journal article and others have pointed out, there was nothing wrong in Business Wire serving these handful of HFTs directly,” Tamraz said in the statement. “However, in discussions that have taken place with a few of our clients, we learned that the article may have caused some misperceptions, and that was of deep concern to us,” she added.

The unusual step is intended to further the industry’s push for safer movement of crude by rail in light of several derailments and crashes in recent months, including one involving a BNSF train in North Dakota last December. The railroad, owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) and a major mover of crude by rail throughout the U.S., plans to seek bids from railcar makers for tank cars with more safety features than those that already meet stronger industry standards, such as thicker walls, thicker ends and more protection of safety and pressure valves. BNSF’s plan is atypical for a railroad, which generally own only the tracks and locomotives that pull trains. Railcars are usually owned by companies that lease them to shippers, or shippers like refiners Phillips 66 (PSX.N) and PBF Energy (PBF.N) that buy their own cars as well as lease. BNSF declined to comment on possible pricing to shippers who opt to use the railroad’s tank cars once they’re built, saying such information is proprietary. Other U.S. railroads also declined comment last week on the Canadian railroads’ decision to charge shippers more for using older tank cars. The December crash of a BNSF crude train in North Dakota involved railcars that don’t meet current industry safety standards, according to investigators. The train crashed into a derailed grain train, setting off fires that burned for more than a day. No one was hurt.

567,BRKa,Business Wire to stop selling directly to high-frequency traders,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway’s Business Wire will no longer sell potentially market-moving press releases directly to high frequency-trading companies, after months of discussion with the New York State attorney general’s office, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday. After consulting with billionaire investor Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s (BRKa.N)(BRKb.N) chairman, Business Wire decided the practice could harm the company’s reputation, not because traders got any sort of time advantage, Cathy Baron Tamraz, chairwoman and chief executive officer of Business Wire, said in a release. Business Wire distributes hundreds of thousands of corporate press releases a year, from the inconsequential to regulatory filings of major importance that can help push a stock sharply higher or lower. A source familiar with the matter said that Business Wire had been in discussions with the New York State attorney general’s office since October, not long after Attorney General Eric Schneiderman gave a speech about such practices. High-frequency traders use sophisticated technology to execute orders faster than traditional segments of the market, even when they receive information such as press releases at the same time as other investors. That, in turn, can translate into higher profits, especially on large volume trades in which even pennies matter. Those conversations with the state attorney general’s office accelerated this month after the Wall Street Journal reported on the difference that milliseconds can make to the profits of high-frequency traders, the source added. The attorney general’s office expressed concern about the practice, the source said. Schneiderman on Thursday encouraged other information services companies to adopt a similar stance. “I strongly encourage other participants in this industry to follow the leadership of companies like Business Wire and join us in the effort to level the playing field between high-frequency traders and the rest of the investing public,” he said in a release. Tamraz, Business Wire’s CEO, referenced the Journal article this month, which looked into how even milliseconds can mean extra profit for high-speed traders. Critics have pointed the finger at such high-frequency trading for volatile market moves, such as the “flash crash,” or abrupt plunge in shares, in 2010. But supporters of high-frequency trading say it adds liquidity to markets. “As the recent Wall Street Journal article and others have pointed out, there was nothing wrong in Business Wire serving these handful of HFTs directly,” Tamraz said in the statement. “However, in discussions that have taken place with a few of our clients, we learned that the article may have caused some misperceptions, and that was of deep concern to us,” she added. An email to Berkshire Hathaway requesting comment was not immediately returned. Last year Thomson Reuters Corp (TRI.TO)(TRI.N) said it would suspend its early release of the widely watched Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment data to a small group of clients.

569,BRKa,"Don't bet the farm; keep investments simple, diversified: Buffett","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett, known for his folksy straightforward communication style, turned to farming to recommend his winning strategy for investors to follow. In an excerpt of his annual letter to shareholders published online by Fortune on Monday, Buffett used a 1986 purchase of a farm located 50 miles north of Omaha to support his case about simple, diversified and low-cost investing. He had bought the farm because he could weigh how much the property would yield in corn and soybeans against its operating costs - and not to speculate on the value of the land or to sell it as soon as prices rose. “Now, 28 years later, the farm has tripled its earnings and is worth five times or more what I paid,” Buffett wrote in his annual letter to shareholders, adding that he has visited the property only twice. “So ignore the chatter, keep your costs minimal, and invest in stocks as you would in a farm.” Buffett’s advice reflected, as well, his bias toward holding assets for the long term. Rather than a constant flux of buying and selling, Buffett said investors should treat daily price changes as background noise, to be ignored in pursuit of a greater objective. “The goal of the nonprofessional should not be to pick winners - neither he nor his ‘helpers’ can do that - but should rather be to own a cross section of businesses that in aggregate are bound to do well,” he wrote. For nonprofessionals, such as mom-and-pop investors saving for retirement, Buffett recommended a low-cost S&P; 500 index fund, particularly highlighting Vanguard’s. That mutual fund has a net expense ratio of 0.17 percent. Buffett - ranked the world’s fourth-richest person by Forbes magazine, with a fortune of $53.5 billion - also dismissed much of the market- and economy-watching that informs daily price fluctuations and, often, future price speculation. “Forming macro opinions or listening to the macro or market predictions of others is a waste of time,” wrote the man dubbed “the Oracle of Omaha” because of his performance in the markets. Investors should instead focus on the future productivity of assets, rather than speculating on price movements, which Buffett said that he was unable to do successfully. “Games are won by players who focus on the playing field - not by those whose eyes are glued to the scoreboard.” Berkshire Hathaway is expected to report its 2013 earnings on Saturday. ",2242014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-buffett-letter/dont-bet-the-farm-keep-investments-simple-diversified-buffett-idUSBREA1N1H520140224
570,BRKa,Buffett letter could show Berkshire winning streak over,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A five-year bull market may have finally outdueled one of the U.S. stock market’s biggest bulls, and Warren Buffett will probably tell investors on Saturday that his 43-year run of beating the Street has come to an end. By his own benchmark for performance, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc almost certainly lagged a red-hot stock market in 2013 and probably also fell short over the previous five years, his favored timeframe for measuring the firm’s return for its investors. Using the gain in Berkshire’s book value per share after taxes, which Buffett traditionally contrasts with the pre-tax total return, including dividends, on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, Berkshire will be hard pressed to match the S&P;’s 128.2 percent gain in the five years ended December 31, 2013. Investors will learn for sure when the world’s fourth-richest man releases his annual letter to investors on Saturday around 8 a.m. Eastern time. Buffett, 83, had already warned last year that he might miss his target, noting that his conglomerate of more than 80 companies and investments might fare relatively better in weaker markets than stronger ones. The S&P;’s sharp rally since 2008 has made Buffett’s benchmark particularly difficult to maintain over the past five years due to a flood of money from the Federal Reserve boosting equity markets. The whopping 32 percent total return on the S&P; last year only makes it more likely that Berkshire’s book value did not match the index’s five-year performance. In fact, he would have required a one-year gain of more than 40 percent in book value per share from 2012’s $114,214 to keep his prized streak alive. Ironically, Buffett took on the role of cheerleader for the American stock market during the depths of the recession, writing an Op-Ed piece in the New York Times on October 17, 2008 imploring readers to “buy America.” Berkshire has grown so big that some investors worry it will not be able to grow as quickly in the future. Hedge fund investor Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management, questioned Buffett about that very issue last year at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting, which draws thousands of people to Nebraska to a question-and-answer with Buffett and other company executives. Kass was invited as Berkshire’s first “credentialed bear” to ask tough questions about the company’s performance. Kass, who remains short Berkshire stock, noted then that Buffett is now looking for larger and larger acquisitions, which are harder to find at attractively undervalued prices. That said, Buffett has hardly become a slouch at making money. Berkshire Hathaway will probably report operating earnings per share of $2,203.91, according to the average analyst estimate as compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, and full-year net income of about $15 billion. The annual letter to shareholders mixes Berkshire’s results with everything from Buffett’s views on the business climate to common-sense wisdowm about investing - as well as an update on Berkshire’s dozens of businesses, from lollipops to insurance. In an excerpt that leaked earlier this week, for example, Buffett yet again banged the drum on the need for simple, disciplined, low-cost investing, especially for nonprofessional investors such as retirement savers. Investors will also scour this year’s letter for any word on a possible successor to Buffett at Berkshire. The Oracle of Omaha, as Buffett is known, has already talked a bit about what Berkshire could look like without him, but he’s shied away from naming the next person to take the baton. Meyer Shields, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc, said he expects “no real information on transition. I’d love to be wrong here, but the odds are ... against the idea of any useful information in terms of who takes over.” The letter is also something of a preview for Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting in early May, when Buffett and other Berkshire executives hold forth in Omaha on where the company could be headed.

571,BRKa,Upbeat Buffett eyes big acquisitions after record Berkshire profit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday signaled he plans to make more large acquisitions for Berkshire Hathaway Inc to expand his conglomerate, which posted a record profit in 2013 with the help of a recovering U.S. economy. “America’s best days lie ahead,” Buffett, 83, said in his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders. “Charlie and I have always considered a ‘bet’ on ever-rising U.S. prosperity to be very close to a sure thing,” he added, referring to his 90-year-old vice chairman Charlie Munger. “Though we invest abroad as well, the mother lode of opportunity resides in America.” The annual letter is widely read not just by Berkshire shareholders, but by investors and others looking for wisdom and guidance from the so-called Oracle of Omaha, the world’s fourth-richest person. Buffett has run Berkshire since 1965, and the Omaha, Nebraska-based company now has more than 80 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, utilities and ice cream. It also owns more than $117.5 billion of stocks. Buffett again signaled that he has no plans to leave his company soon, telling shareholders he intends in next year’s letter to review his first 50 years at Berkshire, and what the future may bring. Full-year profit rose 31 percent to $19.48 billion, or $11,850 per Class A share, while operating profit rose 20 percent to $15.14 billion, or $9,211 per share. For the fourth quarter, net profit rose nearly 10 percent to $4.99 billion, or $3,035 per share, and operating profit rose 34 percent to $3.78 billion, or $2,297 per share. Berkshire’s book value per share, Buffett’s preferred yardstick for measuring net worth, grew 18.2 percent after taxes in 2013 to $134,973. Despite that, the 2009-to-2013 period marked the first time since Buffett took over Berkshire that book value per share rose more slowly over five years than the Standard & Poor’s 500 including dividends on a pre-tax basis. Berkshire’s per share net worth was up about 91 percent during that period, while the index gained about 128 percent. Net worth per share has nonetheless grown at 19.7 percent annual clip under Buffett since 1965, when it was a mere $19. The S&P; 500 annual growth rate was just 9.8 percent. Buffett said he remains on the prowl for more big acquisitions, which he calls “elephants,” after two recent big purchases: a $5.6 billion acquisition of Nevada utility NV Energy by Berkshire’s MidAmerican Energy unit, and a $12.25 billion investment in ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co. He said future purchases could follow the “partnership” structure he used when teaming up with Brazil’s 3G Capital to buy Heinz. Buffett also said Berkshire’s 50 percent Heinz stake could grow if 3G investors decide to sell their shares to him. Berkshire ended last year with $48.19 billion of cash and equivalents, giving Buffett the freedom to make big acquisitions and retain a $20 billion cushion. Munger told Reuters last year that Berkshire would be “stark raving mad” not to pursue another giant acquisition, but that it was difficult to do so because low interest rates had pushed up takeover prices. Thomas Russo, a partner at Gardner Russo & Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, who oversees around $9 billion with about 11 percent of that in Berkshire, said Munger and Buffett have the luxury “to do nothing” until opportunities arise, which strengthens Berkshire’s strategy. In the fourth quarter, Berkshire was a net seller of stock, selling $191 million more than it bought. While Berkshire is known for its insurance businesses, Buffett has been acquiring businesses in other, sometimes boring sectors that are capable of steadily boosting revenue. He said profit from a “Powerhouse Five” of large non-insurance unit — the BNSF railway, Iscar for metalworking, Lubrizol for chemicals, Marmon for industrial products, and MidAmerican Energy — might boost pre-tax profit in 2014 by $1 billion from the $10.8 billion they collected in 2013. Buffett also heaped praise on portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who help choose stocks for Berkshire and now each invest more than $7 billion. “I must again confess that their investments outperformed mine. (Charlie says I should add ‘by a lot.’),” Buffett said, referring again to Munger. “Their contributions are just beginning: Both men have Berkshire blood in their veins.” Berkshire’s succession plan calls for Buffett’s responsibilities to be split in three after he leaves. Buffett’s son Howard would become non-executive chairman, and others would serve as chief executive officer and chief investment officer. Buffett has not said who the candidates for the CEO position are, except that they all work at Berkshire and are men. In the letter, Buffett again praised the work of insurance executive Ajit Jain, who he called an “idea factory,” and called MidAmerican Chief Executive Greg Abel and BNSF Chairman Matthew Rose, as well as new BNSF CEO Carl Ice, “extraordinary managers.” He also said Tad Montross, the head of the General Re reinsurance unit, has turned a business that Buffett once thought he had made a “huge mistake” in buying into a “gem.” Berkshire’s Class A shares closed at $173,708 on Friday, and its Class B shares closed at $115.78. The A shares have fallen 2.4 percent this year. ",3012014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-results/upbeat-buffett-eyes-big-acquisitions-after-record-berkshire-profit-idUSBREA200EX20140301
572,BRKa,Buffett says more bad news on pension funds during next decade,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway chief executive Warren Buffett warned on Saturday that the growing crisis in public pensions will intensify, with “a lot” of bad news to come. In his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett said: “Local and state financial problems are accelerating, in large part because public entities promised pensions they couldn’t afford. Citizens and public officials typically under-appreciated the gigantic financial tapeworm that was born when promises were made that conflicted with a willingness to fund them.” Buffett pointed out a 1975 memo he wrote to Katharine Graham, then chairman of The Washington Post Company, about the pitfalls of pension promises and the importance of investment policy. In that memo, which is 38-1/2 years old, Buffett said the first rule regarding pension costs is “to know what you are getting into before signing up.” He wrote: “There probably is more managerial ignorance on pension costs than any other cost item of remotely similar magnitude. And, as will become so expensively clear to citizens in future decades, there has been even greater electorate ignorance of governmental pension costs.” Many state and local governments are struggling to meet their obligations to retirees, stemming from the economic crisis which put enormous pressure on state and municipal budgets as well as poor decision-making. On Saturday, Buffett said: “During the next decade, you will read a lot of news - bad news - about public pension plans. I hope my memo is helpful to you in understanding the necessity for prompt remedial action where problems exist.” In the 1975 memo, Buffett said it is “next to impossible to decrease pension benefits in a large profitable company - or even a large marginal one.” He said that language allowing companies to terminate or alter their pension plans had been eroded by law. Over the past year, Detroit’s bankruptcy filing and then Puerto Rico’s shaky finances - because of loss of industry, coupled with lavish pensions - have rattled investors and economists. Last year, municipal bond funds hemorrhaged $62.6 billion in net outflows, according to Lipper, a Thomson Reuters unit. That’s more than four times the previous outflow record of $15 billion in 1994. But as the bonds have tumbled, yield-hungry investors have once again started diving in. Those funds have seen net inflows for six of the past seven weeks, their best such performance in a year. “I think that the key issue for the municipal market is to distinguish the state and the local governments that have made changes and are paying in from the ones that haven’t and have major problems,” said Natalie Cohen, the head of muni research at Wells Fargo Securities. “That’s not to deny that it’s not a problem,” she said. Moody’s Investors Service, where municipal bond downgrades made up four of every five rating changes in U.S. public finance last year, said in January that despite increased stability overall, pockets of pressure remain throughout the country.

Citizens and public officials typically under-appreciated the gigantic financial tapeworm that was born when promises were made that conflicted with a willingness to fund them. Unfortunately, pension mathematics today remain a mystery to most Americans. Investment policies, as well, play an important role in these problems. In 1975, I wrote a memo to Katharine Graham, then chairman of The Washington Post Company, about the pitfalls of pension promises and the importance of investment policy. That memo is reproduced on pages 118-136. During the next decade, you will read a lot of news - bad news - about public pension plans. I hope my memo is helpful to you in understanding the necessity for prompt remedial action where problems exist.” ON BERKSHIRE’S EXPOSURE OF BofA: “Berkshire has one major equity position that is not included in the table: We can buy 700 million shares of Bank of America at any time prior to September 2021 for $5 billion. At year-end these shares were worth $10.9 billion. We are likely to purchase the shares just before expiration of our option. In the meantime, it is important for you to realize that Bank of America is, in effect, our fifth largest equity investment and one we value highly.” “Though the Heinz acquisition has some similarities to a ‘private equity’ transaction, there is a crucial difference: Berkshire never intends to sell a share of the company. What we would like, rather, is to buy more, and that could happen: Certain 3G investors may sell some or all of their shares in the future, and we might increase our ownership at such times. Berkshire and 3G could also decide at some point that it would be mutually beneficial if we were to exchange some of our preferred for common shares (at an equity valuation appropriate to the time).” “NV Energy, purchased for $5.6 billion by MidAmerican Energy, our utility subsidiary, supplies electricity to about 88 percent of Nevada’s population. This acquisition fits nicely into our existing electric-utility operation and offers many possibilities for large investments in renewable energy. NV Energy will not be MidAmerican’s last major acquisition.” ‘GEICO’S FLOAT WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY GROW’: “Further gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO’s float will almost certainly grow. In National Indemnity’s reinsurance division, however, we have a number of run-off contracts whose float drifts downward. If we do experience a decline in float at some future time, it will be very gradual - at the outside no more than 3 percent in any year.” “And we will again have a credentialed bear on Berkshire.

578,BRKa,Will Warren Buffett's investment advice work for you?,"New York (Reuters) - In his most recent Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letter, the ever-folksy Warren Buffett sounds more like a personal finance guru than a financial mastermind, focusing on buy-and-hold investing and advocating indexing strategies. Buffett's net worth is about $60 billion, according to Forbes magazine, so he is obviously doing something right. But how sound is his advice for the rest of us? (here) I spoke to some financial advisers and pundits, some of whom are the kind of folks Buffett thinks you should ignore, to get their take. What immediately caught my eye is Buffett’s instruction that his wife back up the truck and invest in the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock-index upon his death. That’s not a huge surprise, though. Buffett is a longtime fan of Jack Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group, who champions passive, low-cost investing. But this is the first time Buffett is “putting his money where his mouth is in his own estate,” Bogle said in a email exchange with Reuters. Specifically, Buffett wants the trustee of his estate to put 10 percent of his wife’s cash inheritance in short-term government bonds and 90 percent in a low-cost S&P; index fund - and he tips his hat specifically to Bogle’s Vanguard in doing so. Says Buffett: “I believe the trust’s long-term results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors - whether pension funds, institutions or individuals.” Face value, that’s a solid recommendation, although it might seem a bit odd, considering that Berkshire Hathaway has underperformed the S&P; 500 in the past five years, and is trailing it slightly in 2014. But that’s not surprising because Buffett tends to lag a bit in bull markets, says Robert Hagstrom, author of The Warren Buffett Way. “I had this image of the American flag waving in the background as I read the letter,” said Hagstrom. “He’s so bullish about the U.S., not necessarily about stocks, but about the country in general.” When it comes to equities, Buffett’s recommendation to buy the S&P; 500 is solid, experts say. “The S&P; 500 is probably the best index out there - it’s clearly a core holding,” says Lou Kokernak, a financial adviser at Haven Financial Advisers in Austin, Texas. However, other advisers say Buffett is endorsing an asset allocation strategy that’s not optimal for most investors. That’s because the S&P; 500 is focused on U.S. companies, even if quite a few have a multinational tilt. “We refer to that as a home bias, and it’s very dangerous,” says Randy Kurtz, chief investment officer at RK Investment Advisors in Kinnelon, New Jersey. That is exactly why Paul Jacobs of Palisades Hudson Financial Group in Atlanta suggests putting as much as 40 percent of Buffett’s suggested equity stake in foreign stocks. Another criticism? Most investors cannot tolerate the risk of a 90/10 portfolio. “They would be scared out at the bottom when their $1,000,000 would have turned into $500,000 in 2009,” says Matthew Chope, a financial adviser at Raymond James in Southfield, Michigan. “It’s as easy as that. We are paid to manage risk, not just return.” Which brings us to another big Buffett takeaway: invest, rather than speculate. In his 24-page letter, Buffett uses the examples of an office building in New York City and a farm he has visited only twice as investments he has held for the long haul, through the ups and downs of the market. A farm and office building might strike some people as odd investments. Yet they are “classic Buffett” because they get to the heart of what is plaguing investors, who spend more time worrying about the price of an asset rather than its intrinsic value, Hagstrom says. “Investment is focusing on the asset and what that asset will earn, while speculation focuses on the price and predicting what the changes in price will be,” says Hagstrom. Writes Buffett: “With my two small investments, I thought only of what the properties would produce and cared not at all about their daily valuations. Games are won by players who focus on the playing field - not by those whose eyes are glued to the scoreboard.” That is the key takeaway from Buffett’s latest tome to shareholders, says Josh Brown, chief executive officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management in New York City and a frequent pundit. “He invests like an owner and keeps himself aware of his own weaknesses,” Brown says. “He buys companies that he prefers to own no matter what happens with the macroeconomic picture.” Can investors tune out the incremental ups and downs of the market? That is a tall order. But I do love this little nugget from Buffett: “If you can enjoy Saturdays and Sundays without looking at stock prices, give it a try on weekdays.” I just might try that one.

579,BRKa,Bill Gates reclaims top of Forbes billionaire list from Slim,"March 3 (Reuters) - Bill Gates has returned to the top of Forbes magazine’s annual list of the world’s richest people, as rising stock markets swelled the ranks of billionaires, which included a record number of women. With a net worth of $76 billion, the Microsoft Corp  co-founder reclaimed the top spot after a four-year hiatus, toppling Mexico’s telecommunications mogul Carlos Slim Helu, who placed second at $72 billion, Forbes said in announcing the list on Monday. Amancio Ortega, the Spanish founder of clothing conglomerate Inditex SA, which includes the Zara fashion chain, ranked third at $64 billion. Investing icon Warren Buffett, who runs Berkshire Hathaway Inc and is a frequent bridge partner for Gates, was fourth at $58.2 billion. Oracle Corp chief Larry Ellison came in fifth at $48 billion. Gates has topped the list in 15 of the last 20 years. A record 1,645 billionaires with a total net worth of $6.4 trillion made Forbes’ list, up from 1,426 last year. Just over 10 percent were female, with 172 women compared with 138 a year earlier. Wal-Mart Stores Inc heiress Christy Walton was the highest-ranking woman, in ninth place, at $36.7 billion. France’s Liliane Bettencourt, who got much of her wealth from cosmetics company L’Oreal SA, was next among women at $34.5 billion, and ranked 11th overall. The Internet was well-represented. Google Inc  founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin ranked 17th and 19th, worth a respective $32.3 billion and $31.8 billion, while Amazon.com Inc’s Jeff Bezos was between them at $32 billion. Facebook Inc founder Mark Zuckerberg, 29, more than doubled his net worth to $28.5 billion, and ranked 21st. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who left office two months ago, was 16th at $33 billion, built mainly through his eponymous media company. Forbes said the year’s biggest loser was Brazilian tycoon Eike Batista, whose net worth fell below $300 million from $10.6 billion as his oil and natural resources empire collapsed amid too much debt and falling output. Roughly two-thirds of the world’s billionaires, or 1,080, were self-made. The United States had the most billionaires, with 492, followed by China at 152 and Russia at 111.

581,BRKa,Berkshire prefers buying big businesses: Buffett on CNBC,"(Reuters) - Conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) would rather keep buying big businesses than simply adding to stock holdings, company head and legendary investor Warren Buffett said on Monday. “Our preference at Berkshire is to keep buying big operating businesses,” the billionaire investor said in an interview on CNBC. “In terms of building Berkshire for the long term, we just like adding earning power, big chunks of earning power.” However, he added that stock holdings were “generally for very long term.” The interview came two days after Buffett released his annual letter to shareholders, in which he signaled that his hunt for “elephants,” or large acquisitions, continues. That business-buying strategy has helped Buffett build Berkshire over the decades so it now holds dozens of businesses, from ice cream to insurance. With Berkshire’s range of businesses and stock holdings, some analysts compare Berkshire to an index fund tied to the health of the U.S. economy, the world’s biggest, in which Buffett has expressed strong optimism in recent years. But as Berkshire has grown, regulators are now weighing whether Berkshire Hathaway should be considered a systemically important financial institution, or one that is too big to fail, Bloomberg reported earlier this year. “We’ve heard absolutely nothing from the people in charge of what’s called SIFI,” Buffett said on CNBC on Monday. As he’s done over the years, Buffett encouraged investors of all sizes and stripes to put their money to work, potentially earning greater returns than by simply holding cash. Still, in emphasizing productive assets, he noted at least one investment in which he is not bullish: bitcoin. “It’s not a currency,” he said flatly. Mt. Gox, once the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy on Friday, underscoring the growing pains facing the world of cryptocurrencies. “I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s not around in 10 to 20 years,” he added.

587,BRKa,Buffett fails to dispel investor angst over succession plan,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett is seeking to reassure shareholders about how his Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) will perform in the decades after he steps down or dies, but remains as vague as ever about succession plans. And that means some followers of the 83-year-old billionaire’s huge insurance and investment company remain far from comforted by his words, and worry about how well Berkshire can thrive without him. “I don’t know of any good examples of an iconic CEO like Buffett ever being successfully followed,” said Meyer Shields, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. Examples from the last 15 years show how hard this can be. Jeff Immelt, the CEO at General Electric Co (GE.N), has been unable to get his company’s share price anywhere near the heights achieved by his predecessor Jack Welch. Steve Ballmer had similar problems following Bill Gates at the helm of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). And after a strong start in following the iconic Steve Jobs, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) CEO Tim Cook has had some major struggles in the past 18 months and the company’s share price is well off its highs. One problem for any successor is that Buffett, by dint of his long stewardship of Berkshire and the outperformance he has delivered over most of the past half century, has the freedom to make mistakes or underperform the stock market in ways that could cost other CEOs their jobs. “I feel sorry for the person who follows in his shoes,” said Dave Sather, president at Sather Financial Group, which invests more than 5 percent of its $365 million of assets under management in Berkshire. “Buffett’s in a very unique position... to where he can just think 100 percent independently. I worry that the next person will not have quite the same flexibility to be a dealmaker.” Certainly, Buffett’s profitable deal-making has been a boon to Berkshire for decades, and has at times been transformative for the company. In his annual letter to shareholders this weekend, Buffett noted that Berkshire’s performance trailed the Standard & Poor’s 500 .SPXTR in 2013 - and in fact, even on a five-year basis it lagged that benchmark for the first time under Buffett. Berkshire’s net worth per share rose about 91 percent in the five years, while the index gained about 128 percent. Still, since 1965, Berkshire’s book value per share has risen to $134,973 from $19. The nearly 20 percent annualized gain is twice the rate of growth in the S&P; 500. Buffett has said that Berkshire is likelier to outperform the S&P; when markets are weak or moderate, in contrast to the surge in equities last year. While it lagged over the last five years, it has outperformed over the last six, including during the 2008 financial crisis. Berkshire plans eventually to split Buffett’s three roles as CEO, chief investment officer and chairman. The only one of those positions where succession has been clearly flagged is the last: Berkshire plans to make his son Howard non-executive chairman. Berkshire’s board had previously identified three internal candidates for the CEO job, though it has never named any of them, with one of those selected to take over immediately in an emergency. But in a regulatory filing on Monday, Berkshire eliminated its previous statement about the number of candidates and said only that “certain current” managers of subsidiaries were CEO candidates. Speculation over succession has mounted in recent years, including after Buffett underwent radiation therapy treatments for prostate cancer in 2012. Buffett on Saturday praised some of the people who investors believe could be among his potential successors - including Ajit Jain (the head of his insurance operations), Greg Abel (the chief of his power utility MidAmerican), and Matthew Rose (who leads his railroad company BNSF). He also pointed out that portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler - who could be candidates for the chief investment officer job - had outperformed not only Berkshire’s returns but those of the S&P; 500 last year, though their portfolios of more than $7 billion each are small compared with the massive one that Buffett himself oversees. The strong bench may not mean a lot in the days immediately after Buffett disappears from the scene, investors say. “When he’s gone the stock price will probably get hit a little bit, 10 percent, 20, I don’t know,” said Paul Lountzis, president of Lountzis Asset Management in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. Still, he said, such a decline would be “a great buying opportunity.” He cites the quality of Berkshire’s assets and the teams Buffett has put in place at various subsidiary units. Lountzis invests more than 15 percent of his roughly $100 million of assets under management in Berkshire. Not that Buffett isn’t preparing for the days when he isn’t around. In the annual letter, Buffett said Berkshire is thinking a century ahead when the Omaha, Nebraska-based company makes big acquisitions now. Last year, he bought half of ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co for $12.25 billion and Nevada utility NV Energy for $5.6 billion last year, to complement the more than 80 Berkshire businesses in areas from insurance to ice cream. Heinz and NV Energy are companies that “fit us well and will be prospering a century from now,” Buffett said. He also said the BNSF railroad and MidAmerican Energy units “will still be playing major roles in our economy” when the year 2114 rolls around, while “insurance will concomitantly be essential for both businesses and individuals - and no company brings greater human and financial resources to that business than Berkshire.” Some investors point out that Buffett has shifted Berkshire more toward operating companies that pile up money, adding security for the future. “He literally has built a perpetual cash generating machine,” said David Rolfe, chief investment officer at Wedgewood Partners Inc in St. Louis, which invests 9 percent of its $7 billion of assets under management in Berkshire. Buffett did drop one small hint about his eventual departure, buried in a discussion of accounting practices. Speaking about certain charges, Buffett said the full amortization “usually takes 15 years and - alas - it will be my successor whose reported earnings get the benefit of their expiration.” Buffett would be 98 by then.

588,BRKa,Bet on Buffett's company before Icahn's company: Barron's,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) trades at a lower premium and has more earnings power than Carl Icahn’s Icahn Enterprises Inc (IEP.O), and investors wishing to invest alongside either billionaire may want to side with the so-called Oracle of Omaha, Barron’s said in its March 10 edition. Both conglomerates posted record profit in 2013, with Berkshire recording $19.5 billion of net income and $15.14 billion of operating income while Icahn Enterprises, a so-called master limited partnership, posted a $1.03 billion profit. Berkshire owns more than 80 businesses including the BNSF Railway and Geico car insurance, and shares such as Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Coca-Cola Co (KO.N). Icahn Enterprises owns stakes in companies like auto parts maker Federal Mogul Corp FDML.O, and through investment in an Icahn hedge fund stocks such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Herbalife Ltd (HLF.N). The two companies’ shares have performed much differently so far this year. Berkshire’s Class A shares closed on Friday at $183,772, after touching a record high earlier in the day. Meanwhile, Icahn Enterprises shares closed Friday at $116.69, which was 22 percent below its record set in December. According to Barron’s, Berkshire looks like a better buy. Berkshire trades at 1.36 times its year-end book value of $134,973 per share, and the newspaper said it may trade at a discount to intrinsic value, citing Buffett’s repeating in his annual shareholder letter this month that Berkshire’s intrinsic value “far exceeds” its book value. Assuming some profit improvement, Berkshire’s book value could approach $145,000 per share by year end, Barron’s said, or 1.27 times the current share price. That would be close to the 1.2 multiple at which Buffett, 83, said in the letter he would be “aggressive” in buying back stock, after buying back none in 2013. In contrast, Barron’s said Icahn Enterprises’ share price is nearly 50 percent above what the company calls its “indicative asset value.” The newspaper said that price “looks excessive” because the company wholly owns only a small group of businesses, and its performance hinges on Icahn’s continued investing success. “Icahn, at 78, continues to deliver,” Barron’s said. “But the current price of Icahn Enterprises discounts a lot more success by the billionaire.

That would be close to the 1.2 multiple at which Buffett, 83, said in the letter he would be “aggressive” in buying back stock, after buying back none in 2013. In contrast, Barron’s said Icahn Enterprises’ share price is nearly 50 percent above what the company calls its “indicative asset value.” The newspaper said that price “looks excessive” because the company wholly owns only a small group of businesses, and its performance hinges on Icahn’s continued investing success. “Icahn, at 78, continues to deliver,” Barron’s said. “But the current price of Icahn Enterprises discounts a lot more success by the billionaire. Berkshire looks like a better bet.”",3092014,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N0M60E920140309
590,BRKa,How you can build on Warren Buffett's investment advice,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By John Wasik CHICAGO (Reuters) - While it is hard to knock the advice of Warren Buffett, whose annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders recently lofted down from the mountain of capitalism, some of his tips can be tweaked. Among the many nuggets of wisdom in the Berkshire report was a recommendation from the company’s chairman to the trustee of his estate that 10 percent of the cash be invested in short-term government bonds and 90 percent in a “very low-cost index fund (Vanguard’s).” Buffett is spot on about holding onto an index fund and avoiding the exorbitant fees of active managers. But we should look at his advice a bit more closely. In an earlier Buffett blog on Fortune.com, the legendary investor cited the ticker symbol for the Vanguard 500 Index fund. The fund charges 0.17 percent in annual expenses and owns the top 500 U.S. stocks by market capitalization, such as Apple Inc, Exxon Mobil Corp and Google Inc. As of Friday, it was up about 2 percent year to date. In line with Buffett’s penchant for penny-pinching and focus on long-term returns, I was wondering if you can find a better index fund. You can certainly find a cheaper fund that tracks the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index. Vanguard’s exchange-traded S&P; 500 Index fund charges only 0.05 percent annually and trades commission-free through many discount brokers, include Vanguard. I would also call into question Buffett’s selection of the Vanguard 500, which picks a near-static basket of the most popular U.S. stocks, many of which could be overvalued. What might appeal more to Buffet’s bargain-picking acumen would be a fundamental S&P; 500 fund like the Guggenheim S&P; 500 Equal Weight ETF, which owns roughly equal percentages of stocks in the index, including lesser-known companies like LSI Corp, Harman International Industries and F5 Networks Inc. Instead of overweighting the most popular stocks the way most S&P; 500 funds do, the Guggenheim fund tilts in the favor of lower-priced companies that pay regular dividends. This strategy beat the S&P; 500 index for the past decade by almost two percentage points. It is up 3 percent year to date, compared with about 2 percent for the S&P; 500, and costs 0.40 percent annually to own. Even though Buffett is recommending them, far too many investors may think index funds are too staid for their tastes. They will want to achieve stellar returns like Buffett has over the past 50 years. Although it is hard to quibble with Buffett’s compounded performance at Berkshire Hathaway - the overall gain is 693,518 percent from 1964-2013 - the big jumps came quite a while ago. Berkshire now appears to be more index fund-like, at least in terms of overall return. For the last four of the last six years, the stock has underperformed the S&P; 500. Is Buffett losing his swagger? For the sake of clarity, it should be noted that the S&P; index returns are pretax, while Berkshire’s are after taxes, so Buffett still has the edge in the long term. Still, would it make sense to invest in Berkshire Hathaway now rather than just stay in an index fund? While most of Berkshire’s investors and Buffett’s many admirers want to see the chairman live forever, most of his best trades, deals and holdings remain in the past. This despite his statement in the Berkshire annual report that “book value and intrinsic value will outperform the S&P; in years in which the market is down or moderately up.” Yet you cannot expect the company, especially under Buffett’s still-unnamed successor, to continue its winning ways. For the interim, most of Buffett’s advice is solid, but with some caveats. I would still buy the lowest-cost index fund but would make sure I had a basket of non-U.S. stocks in developed and emerging markets in a total market international fund like the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF. The fund, which charges 0.05 percent annually in management expenses, tracks an index of non-U.S. stocks like Nestle S.A., Roche Holdings AG and HSBC Holdings PLC. The same thinking on broad global diversification would apply to my bond holdings for my short-term cash needs - money I need in a year or less - in a short-term Treasury or corporate bond or money-market fund. I would also want part of my income portfolio in European and emerging-markets bonds, municipal bonds and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, high-yield corporate debt and floating-rate notes for inflation protection. All of this begs for more index fund investing across the board. So you should not mistake Buffett’s one gem of advice as a one-stop solution. There is a simple formula behind it, but you need to apply it broadly.

592,BRKa,Berkshire gets TV station in swap with ex-Washington Post owner,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc plans to shed much of its 40-year-old investment in Graham Holdings Co, the former publisher of the Washington Post, and swap most of its shares for a Miami television station and other assets. According to a Wednesday regulatory filing, Berkshire plans to turn over more than 1.61 million Graham shares worth in excess of $1.1 billion. It will receive ABC affiliate WPLG-TV in Miami, at least $400 million of Berkshire stock now owned by Graham, and cash. The swap is designed to be tax-free, saving both companies millions of dollars. It values the TV station at $364 million, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing shows. “I am sure this is a mutually beneficial transaction for both companies,” Buffett said in a statement. “While this transaction will greatly reduce our position in Graham Holdings, our admiration for the company and its management is undiminished.” Buffett, the world’s fourth-richest person, is shedding more than 90 percent of one of his oldest and most successful investments and reducing his ties to the Graham family. The swap would leave Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire with roughly 100,000 of the 1.73 million Graham shares it owns. Those shares were worth more than $1.2 billion as of Tuesday. Berkshire paid $11 million for its stake in 1973. Buffett, 83, had been a longtime confidant of Katharine Graham, the former Post chief executive officer and mother of current CEO Donald Graham. Katharine Graham died in 2001, and Buffett stepped down from the company’s board in 2011. “Warren Buffett’s 40-year association with our company has been extremely good for our shareholders,” and WPLG employees can now join “one of the greatest companies in America,” Donald Graham said in a statement. The transaction is subject to the completion of final paperwork, regulatory approval and other conditions. Graham Holdings changed its name from Washington Post Co after selling its flagship paper last year to Amazon.com Inc CEO Jeff Bezos. The Washington-based company’s businesses now include education company Kaplan Inc, as well as other TV stations and online news website Slate. “Buffett has been a great friend of the Graham family, but the business relationship may have run its course after the Post was sold, and they may have decided to call it a day,” said Andy Kilpatrick, who plans next month to release a revised version of his book, “Of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett.” Kilpatrick said the tax-free nature of the transaction made the swap “a beautiful business deal” for both companies. Buffett’s plans for the TV station are unclear, although it is not Berkshire’s first foray into the media business. The company already owns dozens of newspapers, including its hometown Omaha World-Herald. It has more than 80 businesses overall, including Geico insurance, the BNSF railroad, MidAmerican Energy and Dairy Queen ice cream. A spokeswoman said Buffett was not granting interviews on the transaction with Graham Holdings. Donald Graham was not immediately available for further comment. ABC is owned by Walt Disney Co. In afternoon trading, Berkshire Class A shares were up 0.1 percent at $187,345, and its Class B shares were up 0.3 percent at $125.03. Graham stock rose 3.3 percent to $732.79.

597,BRKa,"Berkshire opposes dividend proposal; Buffett, Gates get pay rises","March 16 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc  has urged shareholders to vote against a proposal that it consider spending some of its $48.2 billion of cash on a “meaningful” dividend. According to a Berkshire proxy filing on Friday, David Witt, a Cincinnati resident who owns nearly $8,600 of Berkshire stock, will propose the payout at the company’s May 3 annual meeting. Berkshire has not paid a cash dividend since 1967. “Whereas the corporation has more money than it needs and since the owners unlike Warren are not multi-billionaires, the board shall consider paying a meaningful annual dividend on the shares,” Witt’s proposal said, referring as Buffett does to shareholders as owners. Buffett was not immediately available for comment. His $58.2 billion net worth makes him the world’s fourth-richest person, Forbes magazine said this month. In opposing Witt’s proposal, Berkshire’s board said it already considers annually whether the Omaha, Nebraska-based company should retain all earnings. Buffett, 83, has long maintained that he can generate better returns through acquisitions such as the BNSF railroad and investments such as Wells Fargo & Co. He told shareholders in 2011 that Berkshire’s share price ought to fall if the company decided to pay a dividend. Buffett also wants to keep a $20 billion cash cushion. “Our shareholders are far wealthier today than they would be if the funds we used for acquisitions had instead been devoted to share repurchases or dividends,” he said in his March 2013 annual letter. “Though large transactions of the BNSF kind will be rare, there are still some whales in the ocean.” Berkshire also urged shareholders to vote against a proposal that it set goals for its energy businesses to reduce greenhouse gas and other emissions. Similar proposals failed in 2011 and 2013. Buffett controls one-third of Berkshire’s voting power. Shareholder proposals that Berkshire opposes typically fail by overwhelming margins. Berkshire also disclosed that Buffett’s compensation rose 15 percent last year to $485,606. That includes his usual $100,000 salary, plus $385,606 for personal and home security. The company also said it paid most directors an extra $300 last year. That meant Bill Gates, the Microsoft Corp  co-founder and world’s richest person, was awarded $2,100 last year for his work as a Berkshire director.

598,BRKa,Los Angeles should adopt Warren Buffett pension formula: study,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Los Angeles, faced with nearly $10 billion in unfunded pension and retirement liabilities, should adopt the pension formula used by investor Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway Inc to manage the city’s growing retirement costs, a report recommended on Wednesday. The Los Angeles 2020 Commission, chaired by former U.S. Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor and former deputy mayor and investment banker Austin Beutner, recommended that America’s second-largest city cut the projected return rate on its pension investments from 7.75 percent to 6 percent, the rate used by Buffett for Berkshire Hathaway’s pension system. Such a move would require the city to pay an extra $560 million a year into its two main retirement funds, said Miguel Santana, the city’s administrative officer, who was not party to the report’s recommendations. Los Angeles projects its deficit next year at $240 million, and such a drop in the projected rate of return would pose a “significant challenge to the city,” Santana told Reuters. The lower the projected return rate, the more cities and employers must pay into retirement funds. Los Angeles’ current 7.75 percent projected return rate is similar to that used by many other cities. The portion of the city’s budget spent on retirement costs has grown from 3 percent in 2003 to 18 percent this year. Unfunded liabilities - the amount of money the city has to pay to meet its long-term obligations - have increased to $9.4 billion in the past 10 years from $87 million, according to a recent report by California Common Sense, a budget watchdog. Pension reformers argue that unless municipalities take immediate action to pour more money into public pension systems, some will face a crisis, including possible bankruptcy, in the future because they failed to set aside necessary funds to pay retirement promises made to current workers. In March, Buffett warned that the crisis in public pensions will intensify. The main reason, he wrote in a letter to shareholders, is that public entities have promised pensions they cannot afford. The Los Angeles panel wrote: “Can anyone in City Hall claim to know more about understanding future liabilities and how to budget today for them than Warren Buffett?” It is unlikely the pension recommendation will be adopted by the current mayor, Democrat Eric Garcetti, who is scheduled to give his first State of the City address on Thursday. Yusef Robb, a spokesman for Garcetti, said: “Mayor Garcetti always welcomes new ideas as he works to reform City Hall and improve our economy.” In its initial report in January, the commission said Los Angeles was faced with high poverty, crumbling infrastructure, terrible traffic, weak government, and unfunded pensions. It noted that L.A. is the only major U.S. city to show a net decline in jobs in the last decade. The panel made a series of recommendations, including raising the minimum wage, merging the harbors of Los Angeles and Long Beach into a single port facility, and adopting a more transparent and responsible budgeting process.

The panel made a series of recommendations, including raising the minimum wage, merging the harbors of Los Angeles and Long Beach into a single port facility, and adopting a more transparent and responsible budgeting process.

601,BRKa,Aon CEO says Berkshire Hathaway deal good for Lloyd's market,"LONDON (Reuters) - The head of insurance broker Aon has mounted a defense of a deal signed last year with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway that some fear could weaken the Lloyd’s insurance market, arguing it is good for London. In a speech on Thursday in London’s Lloyd’s building, Aon Chief Executive Greg Case said the agreement, whereby the broker allocates 7.5 percent of the business it places in the market to Berkshire Hathaway in return for passing on some of the risk, benefited the centuries-old market. Critics had feared it would sideline underwriters operating in the Lloyd’s market, putting pressure on their businesses, but Case argued it was helping bring more money into the market, fuelling overall business volumes. The volume of premiums placed by Aon clients in the market increased last year, he said. “The premium volume placed by Aon clients in Lloyd’s increased 3 percent in 2013, which is actually 5 percent if you factor out the reduction in certain lines because of trade sanction issues,” he said. “Innovation... is good for clients, is in turn good for London, is in turn good for Lloyd’s,” he said. Aon recently opted to relocate its headquarters to London from Chicago and is set to move into a new skyscraper, still under construction, that looms over the modernist building that houses the Lloyd’s market. In 2013 it signed an eight year sponsorship deal with football team Manchester United (MANU.N), which Case said had boosted brand awareness around the world for the firm in a way that had left him “stunned”.

603,BRKa,Buffett: moving oil by rail safely major industry concern,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, chairman of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), said on Wednesday that safety is a major priority for the rail industry, after a recent spate of accidents raised concerns about how to transport oil safely. “I can tell you that’s all they’re thinking about,” the investor said in an interview with Reuters. “We’re going to move a lot of crude in this country, and we have to learn how to do it very safely,” he added. He added that the delay in the construction of the Keystone pipeline was unlikely to prompt additional purchases of tank cars at Berkshire railroad unit BNSF. Earlier this year the railroad said it plans to buy its own fleet of up to 5,000 new crude oil tank cars with safety features that exceed the latest industry standards. Oil by rail has surged in recent years, helped by a boom in North Dakota. Traffic is now running 10 percent ahead of last year at this time, with BNSF accounting for roughly a third of U.S. oil-by-rail traffic. But recent accidents have underscored the dangers of transporting the volatile fuel by train, with Canada now planning to phase out older tank cars to improve safety. COCA-COLA COMPENSATION PLAN Buffett also said, in an interview with CNBC the same day, that he thinks Coca-Cola’s (KO.N) equity compensation plan was excessive, but that Berkshire Hathaway abstained in a shareholders vote. Earlier on Wednesday, Coca-Cola said 83 percent of shareholders approved the plan. Critics, most notably activist investor David Winters, said the plan would dilute the holdings of current shareholders too much. As of December 31, Berkshire owned 400 million shares of the company, just over 9 percent of the shares outstanding. Buffett said he and partner Charlie Munger did not want to vote against the plan because he did not want to show disapproval of management, adding that he has enormous respect for Coca-Cola’s chief executive, Muhtar Kent. “I love Coke, I love the management, I love the directors, so I didn’t want to vote ‘No,’” Buffett said. “It’s kind of un-American to vote ‘No’ at a Coke meeting. I didn’t want to express any disapproval of management but we did disapprove of the plan. The plan compared to past plans was a significant change.” Buffett said he has no intention of selling any Coca-Cola shares. The Coca-Cola board of directors “respects Mr. Buffett’s philosophical stance on equity-based compensation,” the board said in a statement. “We greatly respect his views and look forward to continuing our productive relationship with him for many years to come,” the statement added. Nonetheless, Buffett said that investor activism is getting stronger. “The CEOs are terrified of activists. I can tell you that,” Buffett said. “They are all talking to investment bankers and lawyers and saying, ‘What do we do about this?’” He denied he had soured on his enormous investment in IBM (IBM.N), and said Berkshire bought some more shares this year, although the purchases did not come after IBM’s most recent earnings report. He said he would not rule out future IBM stock buys. Buffett was in New York for lunch with an anonymous bidder who paid $1,000,100 to win last year’s “Power Lunch with Warren Buffett” auction benefiting San Francisco’s Glide Foundation. His New York visit comes ahead of the company’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, on May 3.

In addition, he said that the rail industry as a whole remains concerned about safety after a recent string of accidents. “It’s true that the world is going to need an improved tank car,” the iconic investor said in an interview with Reuters. How to transport oil by rail safety is “all” the industry is thinking about, he said Among the worries he cited was the potential for cyber attacks at Berkshire companies, particularly those with large physical facilities such as BNSF and utility operations. “It’s something that the CEOs of our companies worry about plenty,” he added. BNSF plans to move into tank car ownership and buy its own fleet of up to 5,000 new crude oil tank cars with safety features that exceed the latest industry standards.

The U.S. stock market has been hit with a wave of selling, particularly in high-growth stocks in the technology and biotechnology industries in recent weeks. The Nasdaq composite index .IXIC, which is heavily composed of technology company shares, has fallen more than 5 percent since early March. “We’re not seeing total craziness or anything of the sort, but we’re certainly seeing some companies go public at very high valuations and some private transactions at some pretty fancy prices,” Buffett said. Buffett also said the government should play a part in housing, and that the U.S. public would be better served with a government-guaranteed instrument “in the picture.” He said he did not see any role for Berkshire Hathaway in mortgage financiers Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB. The Senate Banking Committee will meet later this month on a bill that would abolish Fannie and Freddie and replace them with a new agency to back home loans. Lobbying activity in opposition to the bill has stepped up ahead of the meeting. Buffett, who also denied interest in purchasing the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball team, said that Berkshire was working on some pending acquisitions but none of them was very big. “They’re not very huge, but there’s enough going on that I would hope that maybe one or two would materialize,” he said.

608,BRKa,Buffett: Next Berkshire CEO should be only one to get options,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The next chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway should be the only one at the company to get options, Warren Buffett, the current head of the sprawling conglomerate, said on Monday. In an interview with Fortune, Buffett said he had written a memo to the Berkshire (BRKa.N) board to suggest the next CEO should be “the only one who would receive options because he would be the only one who is responsible for the overall success of the operation.” Buffett, an investing icon and the world’s third-richest man, came under fire last week when he said that he disagreed with a controversial equity compensation package for Coca-Cola (KO.N) management but nonetheless abstained from voting. He told CNBC last week that he “didn’t want to express any disapproval of management but we did disapprove of the plan.” He’s since drawn broad criticism for not voting against the measure, which passed. Buffett in the past has spoken out about stock options for executives as expensive and ineffective. In 1995, for example, Buffett wrote: “Who, after all, refuses a free lottery ticket?” and called such arrangements “wasteful to the company.” Still, Buffett said on Monday that executive compensation is not out of whack with pay rates in the rest of the country. “If you run a multibillion-dollar company the difference between a 10 and an eight is huge in terms of value,” he said. “Still, almost on a voluntary basis, I think it should be somewhat restrained in some cases.” He offered no more details on who the next Berkshire Hathaway CEO could be, a source of widespread speculation as investors wonder how much longer the octogenarian can continue in his current role. Buffett, 83 and Charlie Munger, 90, the chairman and vice-chairman, respectively, of Berkshire Hathaway, have each drawn a salary of $100,000 each for more than 25 years. In a securities filing this year, the company noted that “Mr. Buffett has advised the (Governance) Committee that he would not expect or desire such compensation to increase in the future.” Buffett’s fortune is estimated at $65 billion by Forbes magazine.

612,BRKa,Buffett's MidAmerican Energy adopts Berkshire name,"April 30 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s  energy unit has changed its name to Berkshire Hathaway Energy from MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co, the largest of a growing list of businesses to adopt the name of the company run by billionaire Warren Buffett. The change “reflects the benefits we gain from Berkshire Hathaway’s ownership, particularly our ability to reinvest in our businesses and take a long-term view of our customers’ needs,” Greg Abel, the unit’s chief executive, said in a statement on Wednesday. MidAmerican’s new name also reflects a recent trend in which the company Buffett took over in 1965, when it was a failing textile maker, sees its name planted on an array of units. Berkshire ranks fourth in Fortune magazine’s list of the world’s most admired companies. “MidAmerican doesn’t mean much to anybody. Berkshire does,” said Andy Kilpatrick, who last week released a revised version of his book, “Of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett.” “Having a recognized brand name could be a door opener for bringing in business.” In October 2012, a real estate brokerage owned by MidAmerican created the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices brand, putting the Berkshire name on “For Sale” signs around the country. Eight months later, the parent launched a new commercial property casualty insurance unit called Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance. Berkshire’s array of more than 70 newspapers, mostly acquired recently and including its hometown Omaha World-Herald, falls under its BH Media Group Inc umbrella. Berkshire still has many recognizable brands among the more than 80 businesses it owns, including Benjamin Moore paint, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear and Geico auto insurance. In 2013, MidAmerican posted a $1.64 billion profit on revenue of $12.74 billion, and Berkshire’s 89.8 percent stake contributed nearly 8 percent of the parent’s overall profit. Berkshire had taken an initial 76 percent stake in 2000. Berkshire Hathaway Energy is based in Des Moines, Iowa, has about $70 billion of assets and serves 8.4 million customers. Its subsidiaries, including Oregon-based PacifiCorp and the Nevada-based NV Energy utility, for which MidAmerican paid $5.6 billion last year, will keep their names and continue to be run locally. Berkshire will hold its annual shareholder meeting on Saturday in Omaha.

613,BRKa,"UPDATE 2-Phillips 66 profit tops street, shale boom helps","* Profit up as focus increases on midstream and chemicals * Company ordering more railcars to keep up with crude by rail growth * Project to process more oil at Illinois refinery announced   (Adds financial details, executive comments, updates share price) By Kristen Hays and Anna Driver April 30 (Reuters) - Phillips 66, the second-largest independent U.S. oil refiner, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by a big gain from a share exchange and its chemicals and midstream businesses. Crude oil and natural gas pumped from shale formations in the United States have lowered feedstock costs for companies such as Phillips, which is expanding its network of pipelines and processing facilities for increasing onshore output. Phillips, based in Houston, had a first-quarter profit of $1.6 billion, or $2.67 per share, compared with $1.41 billion, or $2.23 a share, in the same quarter of 2013. Excluding a one-time gain of $706 million primarily related to Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s deal to swap its Phillips 66 shares for ownership of the company’s specialty products unit, Phillips 66 earned $1.47 per share. Analysts, on average, had expected a profit of $1.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The results topped expectations on the performance of the chemicals and midstream businesses, analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note to clients. Earnings in the company’s refining business slumped to $306 million from $904 million in the first quarter of 2013, hurt by plant maintenance and lower margins. Profit from the company’s interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical company was $316 million, up 12 percent from a year earlier. Phillips 66 is increasing its capability to receive North Dakota crude via rail at its New Jersey and West Coast refineries, and has ordered 1,200 new tank railcars to move it. That is in addition to 2,000 railcars the company received last year. A spate of fiery crude train crashes last year has increased regulatory scrutiny of the safety of the oil-by-rail movement, which has boomed in tandem with growing U.S. inland oil production. Last week Canadian regulators ordered that all tank railcars that do not meet the industry’s latest safety standards adopted in October 2011 be phased out in three years, and U.S. regulators are expected to recommend similar or possibly tougher rules. Phillips 66’s new fleet and the railcars on order meet the latest standard, Tim Taylor, executive vice president of  commercial, marketing, transportation and business development for Phillips 66, told analysts on Wednesday. The company also is working with contractors and shippers to ensure their fleets do the same. “Certainly we will comply, but we want them to meet the newest specification,” he said. Also on Wednesday, Cenovus Energy Inc announced a $100 million project to expand capacity at its joint-venture 333,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) refinery in Wood River, Illinois, which Phillips 66 operates as part of the 50-50 agreement. The project, which will allow the plant to fully utilize processing capabilities after a $4 billion expansion to run more Canadian heavy crude, will start up in the first quarter of 2016. Shares of Phillips were up 4 cents at $83.79 on Wednesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.

617,BRKa,Berkshire share gains may offer Buffett cover at annual meeting,"OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - A ho-hum stock market so far this year may be just what Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N)(BRKb.N) shareholders needed. As they gather this week at the sprawling conglomerate’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, and rub shoulders with its iconic chairman, Warren Buffett, the fact that its shares are once again beating the broader market should help dim the sour memory of its recent run of underperformance. Last year, for the first time in nearly half a century, the gain in Berkshire's book value over five years - Buffett's preferred measure of performance - lagged the total return of the S&P; 500 .SPX. Buffett himself concedes his company is just not built to run neck and neck with the kind of raging bull market that produced a 128 percent total return for the S&P; from the end of 2008 through 2013. Berkshire, which saw its net worth grow just 91 percent by comparison in that run, does best in a weak market - the weaker the better, perhaps. “For impressive outperformance you need a crisis,” said Meyer Shields, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. “He’s a headline investor,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of Destination Wealth Management, who owns about $18 million of Berkshire’s class B stock. “If bad news comes, he’s looking.” So with the S&P; delivering a return, including reinvested dividends, of just 2.5 percent through the first four months of 2014 - and less than 2 percent on price alone - the 8.7 percent gain in Berkshire shares should provide shareholders some comfort. More importantly for Buffett, it could also offer him some cover as he hosts the company’s annual meeting in Omaha on Saturday, even though he will still face questions about how well the company can do going forward and why, at 83, he still hasn’t named a successor. Often called the called the Woodstock of capitalism, tens of thousands of people make the trek annually to hear Buffett and his partner, Charlie Munger, 90, answer hours of questions about the future of Berkshire, which has operations ranging from insurance to house paint. One topic of discussion is certain to be what he might buy next and how me might structure his next big deal. Analysts at Barclay’s estimate that Berkshire now has about $25 billion available for purchases, but as with last year’s $23 billion Heinz deal, he may opt not to go it alone as he hunts for his “elephants.” In that deal, Buffett broke new ground for Berkshire, partnering with private equity firm 3G Capital for the deal. He could use that template again, Buffett said in an interview with Reuters last week. But he acknowledged that such deals aren’t exactly thick on the ground. “If I live long enough we’ll do another one,” he joked. Buffett is transparent about his purchase criteria. “Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses at sensible prices that have consistent earning power, good returns on equity and able and honest management,” Berkshire noted in a regulatory filing this year. Finding a company that fits his requirements and can soak up that much cash could be a challenge, as could replicating the hands-down success of his largest-ever deal: the $26 billion purchase of Burlington Northern Santa Fe in 2009. In hindsight, he looks prescient for buying the railroad on the eve of a U.S. oil production renaissance that sparked a boom in an oil-by-rail business now dominated by BNSF. He called it an “all-in wager on the economic future of the United States.” Five years later, BNSF now accounts for nearly 20 percent of Berkshire’s pretax income. No less an investor than Bill Gross, in fact, pointed out how hard it will be for investing titans such as himself and Buffett to keep replicating their past success. Last year Gross, the chief investment officer of the bond firm Pacific Investment Management Co, said that he, Buffett and others had seen their returns boosted over the past few decades “during perhaps a most advantageous period of time, the most attractive epoch, that an investor could experience.” In one of his monthly investment outlook missives, Gross mulled whether that time could be drawing to a close: “Perhaps ... it was the epoch that made the man as opposed to the man that made the epoch.” ",5012014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-annual/berkshire-share-gains-may-offer-buffett-cover-at-annual-meeting-idUSBREA4003D20140501
618,BRKa,Buffett pressures Coke privately on compensation plan after publicly abstaining: WSJ,"(Reuters) - The Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) is likely to revise its controversial equity compensation plan for executives before it goes into effect in 2015, following pressure from Warren Buffett, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Buffett, chairman of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), made his reservations about the plan known privately in recent weeks to Coca-Cola’s Chief Executive Muhtar Kent in three conversations, the Journal quoted sources as saying. As of February 24, Berkshire owned 400 million shares of the company, just over 9 percent of the shares outstanding, according to Thomson Reuters data Buffett said last week that he thought Coca-Cola’s controversial equity compensation plan was excessive, but Berkshire Hathaway abstained in the shareholders vote. Buffett, in an interview with CNBC, said he and partner Charlie Munger did not want to vote against the plan because he did not want to show disapproval of Coca-Cola’s management. On Tuesday, Buffett said that he had spoken to Kent “multiple times” and to his son Howard Buffett “very briefly” in reference to the equity compensation plan, adding that his son served Coca-Cola shareholders and not Berkshire on the beverage maker’s board. Buffett’s pressure adds to that from critics, most notably activist investor David Winters, who said the plan would dilute the holdings of current shareholders too much. Coca-Cola had said last week that 83 percent of shareholders approved the plan. Spokesman Petro Kacur said in an emailed statement to Reuters that “no changes are being made to the plan at this time.” The expected changes include awarding fewer options per staffer each year, so the pool of options in the new plan lasts longer, the Journal said, quoting a source. Another choice could be a longer vesting period for options than the four years the plan calls for. A third move would involve flipping the 60-40 percent split between stock options and performance units, the Journal said.

620,BRKa,"Berkshire quarterly profit hurt by winter weather, insurance","OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) on Friday said quarterly profit declined 4 percent, falling short of analyst forecasts, as earnings from insurance underwriting declined and bad weather disrupted shipping at its BNSF Railway unit. Results nonetheless benefited from strength in many businesses, including a one-third increase from underwriting at its Geico car insurance unit, and improvement at economically-sensitive businesses such as its Clayton Homes mobile home unit. First-quarter net income fell to $4.71 billion, or $2,862 per Class A share, from $4.89 billion, or $2,977, a year earlier. Quarterly operating profit fell 7 percent to $3.53 billion, or $2,149 per share, from $3.78 billion, or $2,302 per share. Book value per share, Buffett’s preferred measure of growth, rose 2.6 percent from year-end to $138,426 from $134,973. Analysts on average expected operating profit of $2,172 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Results were also hurt by an 80 percent drop in gains from derivatives, mainly related to contracts whose value grows faster when the stock market rises. Berkshire said such gains are “often meaningless” in trying to understand the company. “It’s the medium- to long-term results that count,” said Mark O’Hare, a private investor from Brisbane, Australia. He said the profit shortfall is “consistent with what Mr. Buffett has always said: underwriting results will vary from year to year. The key is that it’s a profitable underwriting result.” O’Hare was speaking in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger are welcoming tens of thousands to Berkshire’s annual shareholder weekend, which Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists.” They will field five hours of questions on Saturday at Berkshire’s annual meeting. Some may focus on Berkshire’s slowing growth, after Buffett in 2013 missed his five-year target for the first time since taking over the company in 1965. Berkshire’s per share net worth grew 91 percent after taxes from 2009 to 2013, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 including dividends rose 128 percent before taxes. The company’s market value tops $316 billion. It will need big deals, such as last year’s purchase of a 50 percent stake in ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co, to keep growing. Heinz contributed $177 million to first-quarter profit. “In a quarter where the economy didn’t grow, you wouldn’t expect a company that’s considered by the chief executive to be an all in bet on the U.S. economy to have stellar growth,” said Bill Smead, who runs Smead Capital Management in Seattle, which owns $34 million of Berkshire shares. A lack of big mergers has also driven up Berkshire’s cash stake, which rose to $48.95 billion from $48.19 billion at the end of 2013. Buffett has said he wants a $20 billion cash cushion. Operating profit from insurance fell 31 percent to $1.18 billion. Much of the drop was attributable to a reinsurance business, whose lower results reflected currency fluctuations and the absence of a year-earlier gain. Meanwhile, operating profit from noninsurance businesses rose 5 percent to $2.35 billion. This was despite a 9 percent drop at BNSF to $724 million, which Berkshire said resulted from “severe weather conditions and service-related challenges,” especially in northern U.S. states. Berkshire nonetheless projected that BNSF’s profit for the rest of the year will top levels in 2013. Profit generated by Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility unit that Berkshire owns most of and on Wednesday changed its name from MidAmerican Energy, rose 15 percent to $453 million. That unit on Thursday agreed to pay $2.9 billion for AltaLink LP, a Calgary-based unit of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc (SNC.TO) that provides energy transmission services in Alberta.

624,BRKa,"Buffett defends Coke, BNSF at Berkshire annual meeting","OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday defended his recent controversial vote on executive pay at Coca-Cola Co and disappointing performance at railroad BNSF, as investors grilled him on his Berkshire Hathaway Inc conglomerate at its annual shareholder meeting. The investment guru was peppered with questions at the meeting, part of a mostly festive weekend that Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists,” following concerns that Berkshire last year missed Buffett’s five-year growth target for the first time in his 49 years at the helm. Buffett, 83, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 90, took the stage at a downtown Omaha arena as they faced off with the audience and a hand-picked panel often excusing recent worries at the sprawling conglomerate. “Over any cycle we will over-perform, but there’s no guarantee on that,” he said. Berkshire, he said, is designed to perform best when markets are at their worst, unlike in 2013 when the Standard & Poor’s 500 rose 30 percent. Buffett was immediately questioned about Berkshire’s decision to abstain from the shareholder vote on Coca-Cola’s equity compensation plan for executives, even though Buffett thought the controversial plan was excessive. That revelation drew sharp criticism in the run-up to the meeting - particularly since Buffett has in the past called options wasteful and akin to a free lottery ticket. Seated with Munger at a table containing several bottles of Coke and Cherry Coke, Buffett said that “going to war” would likely not have been productive, and that Berkshire’s abstention sent an even more effective message. “We made a very clear statement about the excessiveness of the plan and, at the same time, we in no way went to war with Coca-Cola,” Buffett said. “I don’t think going to war is a very good idea in most situations.” Buffett said he had conversations with Coke’s chief executive, Muhtar Kent, including one in Omaha, where he said he thought the plan was excessive. “I think the best result for the Coca-Cola Company was achieved by our abstention, and we will see what happens in terms of compensation between now and the next meeting of Coke,” he said. Wall Street also came under the spotlight from a person complaining about why more individuals were not being held criminally responsible for recent misconduct, such as from the 2008 financial crisis. “I don’t think there’s anything that changes behavior more than prosecuting individuals,” Munger said. Buffett agreed, recalling his experience at Salomon Inc more than two decades ago, when he became chairman to help clean up a Treasury auction rigging scandal. “I may be biased from my experiences at Salomon, but I lean more toward prosecution of individuals than corporations,” he said. “It’s way easier to prosecute corporations - it’s somebody else’s money, and the prosecution knows it’s going to get a win. (Corporations’) calculus is such that it just doesn’t make sense to fight if you can just write a check, while the individual is fighting to stay out of jail.” The questions came a day after Berkshire posted first-quarter results that just missed analyst forecasts. That report noted weather-related disruptions at railroad BNSF - another topic of concern on Saturday. Buffett handed off, calling in BNSF executive chairman Matt Rose to talk about the company’s service challenges. “We’re making significant investments,” Rose reassured the audience. Buffett added that Berkshire could spend “many, many billions” to improve operations at the railroad, which is the country’s largest player in the booming oil-by-rail business. In contrast, he said a different business, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, was more able to grow through acquisitions. Indeed, much of Berkshire’s growth as a company has come through acquisitions, but it now takes bigger transactions to move the needle. Buffett signaled he would gladly partner again with Brazilian firm 3G Capital, with which he teamed up to buy ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co last year for $23.3 billion. “We’re very likely to partner with them, perhaps on some things that are very large,” Buffett said. “I think 3G does a magnificent job of running businesses.” Later, he added: “What we really want to do at our present size and scope (is) buy big businesses with good management and prices, and then build them over time. Last year, Berkshire underperformed for the first time in nearly 50 years by Buffett’s own preferred measure: gains in the company’s book value, or worth, lagged the S&P; 500. Shareholders at the meeting also rejected a proposal that Berkshire start paying a dividend, after having not made any cash payouts since 1967. The annual meeting in Omaha draws tens of thousands of people to hear Buffett and Munger talk about business, the economy, and even politics and life. It includes a massive exhibit floor that highlights the breadth of Berkshire’s holdings, including Geico car insurance, Borsheim’s jewelry and Dairy Queen ice cream. Before the meeting, Buffett paid $1 for a Dairy Queen vanilla orange bar. As usual, hundreds of shareholders lined up outside the arena well before the doors opened at 7 a.m. CDT. Michael Rodin, owner of Impact Promotional Marketing Products in Des Moines, Iowa, said he arrived at 1 a.m., after having attended more than 20 prior meetings. “The excitement, to get as close to the action as possible, and see the man close, and not with his face on the video screen,” Rodin explained on his strategy. At one point Buffett was asked if he had lost confidence in Berkshire. In his annual letter to shareholders, Buffett disclosed that he had suggested to his estate’s trustee that money left to his wife be largely invested in a low-cost S&P; index fund. The question posed: Why an index fund and not Berkshire stock?

625,BRKa,"WRAPUP 2-Buffett defends Coke, BNSF at Berkshire annual meeting","(Adds details from meeting throughout) By Luciana Lopez OMAHA, Neb., May 3 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday defended his recent controversial vote on executive pay at Coca-Cola Co and disappointing performance at railroad BNSF, as investors grilled him on his Berkshire Hathaway Inc   conglomerate at its annual shareholder meeting. The investment guru was peppered with questions at the meeting, part of a mostly festive weekend that Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists,” following concerns that Berkshire last year missed Buffett’s five-year growth target for the first time in his 49 years at the helm. Buffett, 83, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 90, took the stage at a downtown Omaha arena as they faced off with the audience and a hand-picked panel often excusing recent worries at the sprawling conglomerate. “Over any cycle we will over-perform, but there’s no guarantee on that,” he said. Berkshire, he said, is designed to perform best when markets are at their worst, unlike in 2013 when the Standard & Poor’s 500 rose 30 percent. Buffett was immediately questioned about Berkshire’s decision to abstain from the shareholder vote on Coca-Cola’s equity compensation plan for executives, even though Buffett thought the controversial plan was excessive. That revelation drew sharp criticism in the run-up to the meeting - particularly since Buffett has in the past called options wasteful and akin to a free lottery ticket. Seated with Munger at a table containing several bottles of Coke and Cherry Coke, Buffett said that “going to war” would likely not have been productive, and that Berkshire’s abstention sent an even more effective message. “We made a very clear statement about the excessiveness of the plan and, at the same time, we in no way went to war with Coca-Cola,” Buffett said. “I don’t think going to war is a very good idea in most situations.” Buffett said he had conversations with Coke’s chief executive, Muhtar Kent, including one in Omaha, where he said he thought the plan was excessive. “I think the best result for the Coca-Cola Company was achieved by our abstention, and we will see what happens in terms of compensation between now and the next meeting of Coke,” he said. Wall Street also came under the spotlight from a person complaining about why more individuals were not being held criminally responsible for recent misconduct, such as from the 2008 financial crisis. “I don’t think there’s anything that changes behavior more than prosecuting individuals,” Munger said. Buffett agreed, recalling his experience at Salomon Inc more than two decades ago, when he became chairman to help clean up a Treasury auction rigging scandal. “I may be biased from my experiences at Salomon, but I lean more toward prosecution of individuals than corporations,” he said. “It’s way easier to prosecute corporations - it’s somebody else’s money, and the prosecution knows it’s going to get a win. (Corporations’) calculus is such that it just doesn’t make sense to fight if you can just write a check, while the individual is fighting to stay out of jail.” The questions came a day after Berkshire posted first-quarter results that just missed analyst forecasts. That report noted weather-related disruptions at railroad BNSF - another topic of concern on Saturday. Buffett handed off, calling in BNSF executive chairman Matt Rose to talk about the company’s service challenges. “We’re making significant investments,” Rose reassured the audience. Buffett added that Berkshire could spend “many, many billions” to improve operations at the railroad, which is the country’s largest player in the booming oil-by-rail business. In contrast, he said a different business, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, was more able to grow through acquisitions. Indeed, much of Berkshire’s growth as a company has come through acquisitions, but it now takes bigger transactions to move the needle. Buffett signaled he would gladly partner again with Brazilian firm 3G Capital, with which he teamed up to buy ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co last year for $23.3 billion. “We’re very likely to partner with them, perhaps on some things that are very large,” Buffett said. “I think 3G does a magnificent job of running businesses.” Later, he added: “What we really want to do at our present size and scope (is) buy big businesses with good management and prices, and then build them over time.” Last year, Berkshire underperformed for the first time in nearly 50 years by Buffett’s own preferred measure: gains in the company’s book value, or worth, lagged the S&P; 500. Shareholders at the meeting also rejected a proposal that Berkshire start paying a dividend, after having not made any cash payouts since 1967. The annual meeting in Omaha draws tens of thousands of people to hear Buffett and Munger talk about business, the economy, and even politics and life. It includes a massive exhibit floor that highlights the breadth of Berkshire’s holdings, including Geico car insurance, Borsheim’s jewelry and Dairy Queen ice cream. Before the meeting, Buffett paid $1 for a Dairy Queen vanilla orange bar. As usual, hundreds of shareholders lined up outside the arena well before the doors opened at 7 a.m. CDT. Michael Rodin, owner of Impact Promotional Marketing Products in Des Moines, Iowa, said he arrived at 1 a.m., after having attended more than 20 prior meetings. “The excitement, to get as close to the action as possible, and see the man close, and not with his face on the video screen,” Rodin explained on his strategy. At one point Buffett was asked if he had lost confidence in Berkshire. In his annual letter to shareholders, Buffett disclosed that he had suggested to his estate’s trustee that money left to his wife be largely invested in a low-cost S&P; index fund. The question posed: Why an index fund and not Berkshire stock? Because, he said, he’s unconcerned about maximizing the money he will leave his wife after he passes away. “There will be loads of capital left over” for her, Buffett said.

626,BRKa,Buffett endorses Airbnb to combat hefty Omaha hotel prices,"OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday gave an endorsement for the online home rental service Airbnb Inc, after receiving many complaints from Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders about how many Omaha hotels had jacked up room rates on the weekend of the company’s annual meeting. Many area hotels sell out months in advance for the event, and many rates double or even triple for the weekend. It is not unusual for hotels to charge more than $400 a night for non-luxury accommodations, or require three-night minimums, prompting complaints of price gouging. Buffett said it is understandable that rates might rise, given that Berkshire’s annual meeting now attracts some 38,000 shareholders - roughly two-thirds from outside the area - for what is Omaha’s largest annual tourism event other than the baseball College World Series. “Since we want to increase the demand ... that’s why we have encouraged Airbnb to come in,” he said. Airbnb promotes itself as offering reasonably priced accommodations for visitors in nearly 200 countries. The Silicon Valley start-up last month won a $450 million investment by a group led by private equity firm TPG Capital Management LP, valuing Airbnb at $10 billion. Critics say the service takes away business from legitimate hoteliers, and deprives municipalities of tax revenue. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman last month said he is examining whether the service violates state laws on subletting. Buffett explained that unlike a major convention city such as Las Vegas, Omaha lacks sufficient demand for rooms over the course of the year to justify a big expansion in supply. He likened it to Augusta, Georgia, which he said can’t justify adding huge numbers of rooms for the week it hosts the Masters golf tournament. “Omaha cannot size its hotel supply to the Berkshire meeting,” he said. “What really bothered me was the three-day minimums. Something irritates me about coming to a one-day event and having a three-day minimum ... There were a few that were really pushing things.” According to the Berkshire-owned Omaha World-Herald, Buffett had mused about moving next year’s annual meeting to Dallas, which has more hotel rooms and where Berkshire’s Nebraska Furniture Mart plans to open a new location. Buffett quickly backtracked and confirmed that the meeting, which would take place in his 50th year at Berkshire’s helm, will stay in Omaha, a sentiment he repeated on Saturday. “Omaha people love this event, it’s an economic boon for Omaha, and people get a good impression of Omaha,” he said. “Fortunately, something like Airbnb is sort of a flex supply arrangement that seems to make more sense.” ",5032014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshirehathaway-annualmeeting-airbn/buffett-endorses-airbnb-to-combat-hefty-omaha-hotel-prices-idUSBREA4209L20140503
627,BRKa,Buffett says willing to partner with 3G again on 'very large' deals,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday said Berkshire Hathaway Inc would team up again with 3G Capital on more transactions, perhaps very large ones, despite criticism of the Brazilian investment firm’s decision to cut thousands of jobs at HJ Heinz & Co. “I think 3G does a magnificent job of running businesses,” Buffett said at Berkshire’s annual meeting. “We’re very likely to partner with them, perhaps on some things that are very large.” Berkshire had nearly $49 billion of cash as of March 31 and doesn’t pay a dividend, leaving Buffett and his deputies to look for capital-spending opportunities and takeovers. Smead Capital CEO Bill Smead told Reuters Insider that Berkshire may be eyeing “a huge acquisition” potentially worth around $58 billion, after Buffett’s comments regarding 3G Capital. “He’s built up a huge pile of cash - I think $28 billion in excess of what they need,” Smead said. “And Charlie (vice chairman Charles Munger) said, ‘Well, we can borrow $30 billion on top of that’, that’s $58 billion. That would be a huge acquisition. Now, that might cause a few people that have companies that size to call them. Remember, they don’t do hostile deals. So he opened up some realms today that were new in that respect.” Mario Gabelli, chairman and chief executive officer of Gamco Investors Inc, said Buffett should consider acquiring General Mills, Inc. “In (Buffett’s) annual report, he gives you a couple of dots. One of the dots was very fundamental. He said ‘Look, I learned that the model that I used on Heinz could be duplicated’,” Gabelli said. “What is out there that is a $20 billion-$30 billion acquisition that you can have someone else manage? Why not something like General Mills? Which is cereal, which has been around for about 100 years, where there is pricing power, where there is population is going the right way - and he can put a lot of money to work.” Berkshire contributed $12 billion toward the more than $23 billion purchase of Heinz, but gave 3G day-to-day control of operations. Some critics have said 3G’s job cuts do not reflect Berkshire’s typical values toward people who work at companies it acquires. “We have not enforced, or attempted to enforce, nor do we wish to enforce, a strong discipline in every subsidiary as to whether they have a few too many people or not,” Buffett said. “A great many don’t.” Munger, 90, said Berkshire has never “loved over-staffing.” Buffett responded that the approach to minimizing personnel applies more to Berkshire’s main office in Omaha - Buffett said just 24 people work with him there - than to the company’s businesses, which at year end employed more than 330,000 people. Most subsidiaries are “managed on a lean basis, but that’s not true of everyone we’ve been involved with over the years,” Buffett said.

629,BRKa,Berkshire housing executive laments dearth of first-time buyers,"OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - The chief executive of a real estate brokerage business owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc said the U.S. housing market is more than halfway through its recovery from its recent depths, held back by a paucity of buyers able to obtain financing for their first homes. Ron Peltier, chief executive of HomeServices of America Inc, said “our industry is probably in the sixth inning of a nine-inning recovery,” with very strong activity in coastal markets such as Miami, Boston, New York and Silicon Valley, and in the market for higher-end homes across the country. “The single most-challenged sector of the market is the first-time home buyer,” he said. “Historically, they make up 40 percent of the existing home market. In the last 18 months to two years, it has been 27 to 28 percent. Twelve percent of the market has been missing. It’s troubling.” Peltier spoke in an interview on the sidelines of Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. HomeServices is the second-largest U.S. independent real estate brokerage, and part of a Berkshire unit that was on Wednesday rechristened Berkshire Hathaway Energy. U.S. home resales in March fell to a 1-1/2 year low, dropping to an annual rate of 4.59 million units according to the National Association of Realtors. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell to an eight-month low, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 384,000 units. Bad weather was a factor in both declines. Peltier, though, said many prospective home buyers are facing hurdles that became more commonplace after the nation’s housing slump. “There are still very, very favorable (interest) rates,” he said, but “credit standards and down payments are excruciatingly difficult. There’s a will to buy, not a way to buy.” In the first quarter, Berkshire reported a $24 million pre-tax loss from “real estate brokerage and other” items within Berkshire Hathaway Energy, as spending rose on employment and marketing. Revenue rose 21 percent to $405 million. Some of that extra marketing was to rebrand local brokerages as Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices. That puts the Berkshire name on “For Sale” signs, and Peltier said it is helping business. “The brand is golden,” he said. “We have received an incredible number of comments from every market we’ve launched in that the values associated with the Berkshire brand translate into values that consumers look for: integrity, honesty, trust, value.” That may also be resonating with photographers. Peltier said that in Vail, Colorado, a winter resort that caters to many wealthy people and where Berkshire’s local brokerage is using the Berkshire name, “they’ve never had so many people standing in front of the signs, taking pictures.” ",5032014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshirehathaway-annualmeeting-homes/berkshire-housing-executive-laments-dearth-of-first-time-buyers-idUSBREA4208V20140503
630,BRKa,"Berkshire quarterly profit hurt by winter weather, insurance","OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) on Friday said quarterly profit declined 4 percent, falling short of analyst forecasts, as earnings from insurance underwriting declined and bad weather disrupted shipping at its BNSF Railway unit. Results nonetheless benefited from strength in many businesses, including a one-third increase from underwriting at its Geico car insurance unit, and improvement at economically-sensitive businesses such as its Clayton Homes mobile home unit. First-quarter net income fell to $4.71 billion, or $2,862 per Class A share, from $4.89 billion, or $2,977, a year earlier. Quarterly operating profit fell 7 percent to $3.53 billion, or $2,149 per share, from $3.78 billion, or $2,302 per share. Book value per share, Buffett’s preferred measure of growth, rose 2.6 percent from year-end to $138,426 from $134,973. Analysts on average expected operating profit of $2,172 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Results were also hurt by an 80 percent drop in gains from derivatives, mainly related to contracts whose value grows faster when the stock market rises. Berkshire said such gains are “often meaningless” in trying to understand the company. “It’s the medium- to long-term results that count,” said Mark O’Hare, a private investor from Brisbane, Australia. He said the profit shortfall is “consistent with what Mr. Buffett has always said: underwriting results will vary from year to year. The key is that it’s a profitable underwriting result.” O’Hare was speaking in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger are welcoming tens of thousands to Berkshire’s annual shareholder weekend, which Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists.” They will field five hours of questions on Saturday at Berkshire’s annual meeting. Some may focus on Berkshire’s slowing growth, after Buffett in 2013 missed his five-year target for the first time since taking over the company in 1965. Berkshire’s per share net worth grew 91 percent after taxes from 2009 to 2013, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 including dividends rose 128 percent before taxes. The company’s market value tops $316 billion. It will need big deals, such as last year’s purchase of a 50 percent stake in ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co, to keep growing. Heinz contributed $177 million to first-quarter profit. “In a quarter where the economy didn’t grow, you wouldn’t expect a company that’s considered by the chief executive to be an all in bet on the U.S. economy to have stellar growth,” said Bill Smead, who runs Smead Capital Management in Seattle, which owns $34 million of Berkshire shares. A lack of big mergers has also driven up Berkshire’s cash stake, which rose to $48.95 billion from $48.19 billion at the end of 2013. Buffett has said he wants a $20 billion cash cushion. Operating profit from insurance fell 31 percent to $1.18 billion. Much of the drop was attributable to a reinsurance business, whose lower results reflected currency fluctuations and the absence of a year-earlier gain. Meanwhile, operating profit from noninsurance businesses rose 5 percent to $2.35 billion. This was despite a 9 percent drop at BNSF to $724 million, which Berkshire said resulted from “severe weather conditions and service-related challenges,” especially in northern U.S. states. Berkshire nonetheless projected that BNSF’s profit for the rest of the year will top levels in 2013. Profit generated by Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility unit that Berkshire owns most of and on Wednesday changed its name from MidAmerican Energy, rose 15 percent to $453 million. That unit on Thursday agreed to pay $2.9 billion for AltaLink LP, a Calgary-based unit of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc (SNC.TO) that provides energy transmission services in Alberta. Overall, Berkshire revenue rose 4 percent to $45.45 billion. Berkshire also owns tens of billions of dollars of stocks such as American Express Co (AXP.N), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N). Its smaller businesses sell, among other things, Benjamin Moore paint, Borsheim’s jewelry, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, Johns Manville insulation and See’s candies. In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares closed down $1,173 at $192,255 after earlier hitting a record high, and the Class B shares fell 97 cents to $128.09.

That has prompted questions on whether the so-called Oracle of Omaha is finding it harder and harder to generate the stellar returns he’s delivered for decades, particularly as the company grows so big it needs larger deals to make a difference to the bottom line. The annual meeting in Omaha draws tens of thousands of people to hear Buffett and Munger answer hours of questions. The two talk about not only on the company’s future, but on such topics as U.S. monetary policy and politics. The meeting includes a massive exhibit floor that highlights the breadth of Berkshire’s holdings - from ice cream at Dairy Queen to insurance at Geico, the BNSF railroad to jewelry retailer Borsheims.

Wall Street also came under the spotlight from a person complaining about why more individuals were not being held criminally responsible for recent misconduct, such as from the 2008 financial crisis. “I don’t think there’s anything that changes behavior more than prosecuting individuals,” Munger said. Buffett agreed, recalling his experience at Salomon Inc more than two decades ago, when he became chairman to help clean up a Treasury auction rigging scandal. “I may be biased from my experiences at Salomon, but I lean more toward prosecution of individuals than corporations,” he said. “It’s way easier to prosecute corporations - it’s somebody else’s money, and the prosecution knows it’s going to get a win. (Corporations’) calculus is such that it just doesn’t make sense to fight if you can just write a check, while the individual is fighting to stay out of jail.” The questions came a day after Berkshire posted first-quarter results that just missed analyst forecasts.

In contrast, he said a different business, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, was more able to grow through acquisitions. Indeed, much of Berkshire’s growth as a company has come through acquisitions, but it now takes bigger transactions to move the needle. Buffett signaled he would gladly partner again with Brazilian firm 3G Capital, with which he teamed up to buy ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co last year for $23.3 billion. “We’re very likely to partner with them, perhaps on some things that are very large,” Buffett said. “I think 3G does a magnificent job of running businesses.” Later, he added: “What we really want to do at our present size and scope (is) buy big businesses with good management and prices, and then build them over time. Last year, Berkshire underperformed for the first time in nearly 50 years by Buffett’s own preferred measure: gains in the company’s book value, or worth, lagged the S&P; 500. Shareholders at the meeting also rejected a proposal that Berkshire start paying a dividend, after having not made any cash payouts since 1967. The annual meeting in Omaha draws tens of thousands of people to hear Buffett and Munger talk about business, the economy, and even politics and life. It includes a massive exhibit floor that highlights the breadth of Berkshire’s holdings, including Geico car insurance, Borsheim’s jewelry and Dairy Queen ice cream. Before the meeting, Buffett paid $1 for a Dairy Queen vanilla orange bar. As usual, hundreds of shareholders lined up outside the arena well before the doors opened at 7 a.m. CDT. Michael Rodin, owner of Impact Promotional Marketing Products in Des Moines, Iowa, said he arrived at 1 a.m., after having attended more than 20 prior meetings. “The excitement, to get as close to the action as possible, and see the man close, and not with his face on the video screen,” Rodin explained on his strategy. At one point Buffett was asked if he had lost confidence in Berkshire. In his annual letter to shareholders, Buffett disclosed that he had suggested to his estate’s trustee that money left to his wife be largely invested in a low-cost S&P; index fund. The question posed: Why an index fund and not Berkshire stock? Because, he said, he’s unconcerned about maximizing the money he will leave his wife after he passes away. “There will be loads of capital left over” for her, Buffett said.

635,BRKa,Buffett says Congress may look at tax-driven mergers: CNBC,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Warren Buffett said on Monday that tax-driven mergers could attract the attention of Congress and would cause a “fight” in corporate America. Buffett, in reference to U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc.’s aim to lower its tax rate by changing its domicile to Britain as part of its pursuit of Britain’s AstraZeneca Plc, said that more companies were seeking mergers for tax-driven reasons. “It will gather momentum and my guess is that when you get to companies of this size, this prominence, and with this speed up of momentum, my guess is that Congress one way or another addresses this,” Buffett told cable television network CNBC. “This whole thing on the foreign situation I think will cause one hell of a fight in corporate America,” he said. Buffett said that while there could be a new resolution to corporate taxes beyond the topic of foreign tax rates, U.S. companies were flourishing under the current tax code. “American business, I will tell you, whether it’s Berkshire Hathaway or Pfizer or Apple, are doing wonderfully under this tax code.” Buffett also said that moves in U.S. government bond interest rates did not affect how Berkshire operated. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 2.572 percent on Monday, its lowest level in over three months. “If it moved up 50 basis points or down 50 basis points, we would not do anything differently. We don’t react to macro factors at Berkshire,” he said. He said the 10-year yield would likely be higher than 3 percent by the end of the year. Buffett also reiterated that he had no desire to “go to war” with Coca-Cola Co, and that his approach to the company’s controversial equity compensation plan was more effective than the style that might be used by activist investor Carl Icahn. Buffett, responding to criticism from Icahn regarding Buffett’s decision to abstain from the shareholder vote, said, “I think our style actually would be more effective than the style that might be proposed by Carl.” Buffett told CNBC he had not spoken to Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent since the company’s annual meeting on April 23. Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger said later in the interview that he agreed with Buffett’s decision to abstain from the vote, and that it was not a “difficult decision.” “It took about 10 seconds,” Munger said. “I thought he handled it perfectly.” Munger also said that he was against exporting natural gas given how “precious” it is. “I’m totally against exporting natural gas. I don’t like oil to be exported either,” he said. Buffett also praised Berkshire Hathaway portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, and said that while they were not candidates to succeed him as chief executive, their duties in investing would aid the next chief executive. “They will not be the chief executive officer, but they will be there to help the chief executive officer in that arena,” he said.

636,BRKa,"As Buffett praises his BNSF railroad, customers rail against delays","NEW YORK (Reuters) - When American investor Warren Buffett addresses Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders at the conglomerate’s annual meeting on Saturday, he is sure to laud the impressive growth of BNSF Railroad, his company’s largest-ever acquisition. The railroad, which was struggling amid the Great Recession when Berkshire bought it for $26 billion in 2010, returned a $3.8 billion profit last year. In his annual letter to Berkshire (BRKa.N) shareholders in February, Buffett called BNSF, whose 32,000 miles of track spans 28 states, “the most important artery in our economy’s circulatory system,” handling 15 percent of all inter-city freight across America. Praising BNSF’s smooth relations with customers and regulators, Buffett wrote: “Like Noah, who foresaw early on the need for dependable transportation, we know it’s our job to plan ahead.” Buffett was likening BNSF’s foresight to the biblical figure Noah and his vessel. He added: “America’s rail system has never been in better shape.” What Buffett didn’t mention is that a growing number of BNSF’s customers say the vital artery is clogged, causing economic losses for industrial firms and farmers scrambling to get their products to market. As more U.S. goods ride the rails amid an economic recovery, delays can reverberate widely. A harsh winter bungled rail schedules this year, causing slower train speeds, terminal log-jams and stranded crews and locomotives. Other major railroads, including giant Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N), also have experienced interruptions. Railyards in and around Chicago, a gateway for several major lines, have been backed up for months after record snowfall there over the winter. Even BNSF itself has suffered: Berkshire said on Friday that its first quarter rail unit’s earnings, which fell 9 percent to $724 million, was “negatively affected by severe weather conditions and service-related challenges. Some shippers believe the winter woes are only part of the problem. The concerns have been greatest across the Great Plains and the Upper Midwest, where BNSF is among the dominant rail players and has been the biggest beneficiary of a boom in shipping a high-value commodity - crude oil - from the Bakken oil patch of North Dakota and Montana. According to a Reuters analysis of filings made to the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB), the rail industry’s economic regulator, over the last month more than four dozen industrial trade groups, lawmakers or commodity firms who rely on BNSF and other major Class 1 railroads have lodged complaints or pleas for regulator action to improve their rail service. One common claim is that railroads including BNSF may be de-prioritizing the shipment of other commodities to make way for higher-priced crude oil on their trains, which railroads deny. “BNSF is not favoring crude shipments over other shippers. This is a case of rapid growth for several commodities using parts of our railroad network that hadn’t previously seen that kind of volume,” said BNSF spokeswoman Roxanne Butler in an email. Amid a shale drilling boom, crude-by-rail cargoes are up by around 44-fold since 2008, to nearly a million barrels per day according to industry data. Most of the crude riding the rails originates in the Bakken. BNSF said crude still represents just 4 percent of its total traffic. When Berkshire bought BNSF, Buffett called it “an all-in wager on the economic future of the United States.” At the time, he told TV commentator Charlie Rose that BNSF was “interwoven with the American economy in a way that, if the American economy prospers, the business will prosper.” And prospered it has. Last year, amid a boost in rail cargoes, BNSF’s revenue topped $20 billion and the firm invested nearly $4 billion. It plans to boost spending to $5 billion this year. And despite a weaker first quarter, Berkshire said it expects BNSF’s profits to top 2013 for the rest of the year. But some analysts say the pace of BNSF’s investment has failed to keep up with demand. In a March 14 research note, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that the winter service woes “indicate too little capex was invested given the growth.” At an STB hearing on April 10, BNSF executives apologized for winter-related delays and pledged to deploy more locomotives and crews to improve service in coming months. Their assurances haven’t convinced all customers. United Sugars, whose member firms supply about a fourth of U.S. sugar demand, informed the STB it “harbors grave concerns that BNSF will not be able to quickly resolve its service problems.” Interruptions will cost it tens of millions of dollars this year, and part of the stranded beet crop may rot on the ground. Among others to raise concern are producers of coal, fertilizer, ethanol and steel - even passenger train operator Amtrak. Their complaints aren’t focused solely on BNSF. CP and Union Pacific have been subject to criticism as well. But BNSF owns some key routes. On Amtrak’s Empire Builder line from Chicago to Seattle, which traverses the Bakken region on BNSF track, on-time performance has dropped to 27 percent so far this year, down from 76 percent in 2009. “We’ve had very frank conversations with BNSF about their performance,” said Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari. “The’ve been candid there are issues out there, and they are hiring more crews and locomotives.” Power utility trade group, the Western Coal Traffic League, told the U.S. rail regulator last month that BNSF was offering “declining service metrics,” adding that “members fear they will run out of coal, if not now, by summer.” Nucor Corp (NUE.N), the largest U.S. steel manufacturer, wrote that during the first quarter rail journeys that usually take two weeks required up to two months. The delays “severely affected” profits, it told the regulator. “We are not seeing improvement now that the weather has improved,” the company wrote. The STB has authority to make railroads prioritize shipping of certain goods during bottlenecks, and some customers are calling on the regulator to act. Last month it granted one such request, ordering BNSF and CP railroads to report their schedules for speedier delivery of fertilizer ahead of the spring planting season, which they did. STB spokesman Dennis Watson declined comment on whether further regulatory action is planned. BNSF has bristled at the possibility of further government intervention, telling the regulator in a letter last week that “the extreme step of directing recovery measures to the benefit of a particular commodity group or geographic locale” would hurt overall network speed and other customers. However, it has acknowledged customer concerns and pledged to address them promptly. “The message that we have fallen short on executing from a service perspective was also very clear,” BNSF executive vice president Stevan Bobb wrote in the letter. Again, shippers of staple commodities are concerned railroads are neglecting their cargoes in favor of $100 a barrel oil. “We’re all paying the price for the railroads’ infatuation with moving crude oil,” said Bob Dinneen, head of the Renewable Fuels Association. “Oil companies aren’t complaining. They think the service has been fine.” (This May 3 story was corrected to fix  spelling of Bob Dinneen in last paragraph) ",5052014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bnsf-railway-buffett/as-buffett-praises-his-bnsf-railroad-customers-rail-against-delays-idUSBREA4204N20140505

639,BRKa,Buffett's insiders' Woodstock: James Saft,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger might be the greatest investing team of all time but they are dead wrong about the merits of activist investing. “I don’t think it’s good for America,” Munger said when asked about activist investing, the practice of building stakes in companies in order to try to pressure management to change course. The irony is that Berkshire’s annual jamboree is sometimes called the ‘Woodstock of capitalism’. Nothing could be more capitalist than the owners of companies influencing how they are run, and yet in the form of shareholder capitalism now practiced in the U.S., with its self-protecting circles of top management, boards and consultants, this sometimes feels like a principle more honored in the breach than in the observance. Buffett was a bit more nuanced than Munger, noting that activism “won’t go away and scares the hell out of all our managers.” Both statements are true, and here’s hoping they stay that way. Buffett has attracted criticism from no less an activist than Carl Icahn, who penned a piece in Barron’s taking exception to Buffett’s decision to abstain from a vote on a widely panned executive compensation plan at Coca-Cola, of which he owns about 9 percent. Buffett instead is reported to have elected to work behind the scenes towards a revision. That unwillingness to publicly call out managers, often the result of a chummy familiarity, is typical of those who own large stakes in companies, many of whom, like Buffett, aren’t just investors but agents acting on behalf of other investors. Buffett and Munger, of course, are much to be preferred to the usual run of mutual fund or pension manager, who often neglect corporate governance, thereby abetting the growth and growth of executive compensation. This ‘beat the stock market’ culture of investing has led many to see corporate governance as a sideshow, believing instead that their role is to pick market winners and avoid losers. That’s a lot easier than getting your hands dirty with corporate governance, which is usually less immediately gratifying than watching prices go up and down on a trading screen. Unfortunately it has, along with inadequate shareholder protections in law, led to a situation in which top insiders are able to extract more than their fair share of the value companies create. That’s opened up the way for investors like Icahn, who swoop in and publicly pressure companies to change policies, often by returning more cash to shareholders via dividends or share buybacks. None of this is to say that Icahn and other activists are always, or even usually, right. Arguably their voices are louder than they ought to be because of the deafening silence from so many other share owners. But activists do play a generally useful role despite sometimes arbitraging a broken system to their own advantage. As it stands, company governance is a system of opposing forces which can’t come into balance because insiders are too difficult to dislodge. That’s why activists are so irritating to management, and also why they are so needed. Critics often says that activists act myopically, bringing on short-term spikes but hurting longer-term performance. The data tells a different story. A 2013 study of more than 2,000 hedge fund interventions by activists found improved operating performance in the five years after the fracas. That held true also for interventions using hostile techniques, according to the study by Lucian Bebchuk of Harvard Law School, Alon Brav of the Fuqua School of Business at Duke and Wei Jiang of Columbia Business School. The study found ""no evidence that the initial positive stock price spike accompanying activist interventions fails to appreciate their long-term costs and therefore tends to be followed by negative long-term consequences; the data is consistent with the initial spike reflecting correctly the intervention's long-term consequences."" (here There is a real possibility that the next 20 years of investing will be a lot less juicy for shareholders than the last 50. While the reasons why this may prove true are complex, demographics alone argue that far more investors will be in the stage of life in which they are selling their stakes to live on rather than building them up. It is also easy to observe that the equity risk premium, a simple measurement of what the stock market offers, has been in long-term decline. If a long period of low returns does come, one of the easiest ways for investors, otherwise known as owners, to make good will come through better corporate governance. That would be a Woodstock, in other words, with many more good seats. (James Saft is a Reuters columnist.

647,BRKa,Ex-AIG chief Greenberg loses bid to end New York lawsuit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York state judge has rejected a request by Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, the former American International Group Inc chief executive officer, to dismiss a long-running civil  lawsuit by the state’s attorney general. Greenberg, now 89, and former AIG Chief Financial Officer Howard Smith were accused in the 2005 case of engineering sham transactions, including with the General Re Corp reinsurance unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, to make AIG’s financial health look better. This alleged accounting fraud led to a $3.9 billion restatement, which predated the insurer’s $182.3 billion federal bailout stemming from the 2008 financial crisis. David Boies, a lawyer for Greenberg, said his client plans to appeal. Vincent Sama, a lawyer for Smith, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Justice Charles Ramos of the Manhattan state supreme court on Wednesday rejected the defendants’ arguments that state law barred Attorney General Eric Schneiderman from seeking to recoup some of their pay, and ban them from the securities industry and from serving as officers or directors of public companies. The judge also said arguments that the defendants “pose no threat to the New York public” because they do not lead public companies or plan to publicly sell securities involve issues of fact to be resolved at a trial, which would not have a jury. “The issues remaining in this action must be tried,” Ramos wrote. The lawsuit was first brought by Eliot Spitzer, then the state’s attorney general, and has been continued by his successors, Andrew Cuomo and now Schneiderman. Matt Mittenthal, a spokesman for Schneiderman, said: “We look forward to moving toward a trial that will finally offer the opportunity to hold Mr. Greenberg accountable for his alleged role in a massive fraud.” Last June, New York’s Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court, also let the case go forward, even though Schneiderman had earlier in the year dropped damages claims worth a potential $6 billion. “We have no difficulty in concluding that, in this civil case, there is evidence sufficient for trial that both Greenberg and Smith participated in a fraud,” the appeals court wrote. Greenberg now runs privately held C.V. Starr & Co. Buffett was not implicated in wrongdoing. The case is People v Greenberg, et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 401720/2005.

648,BRKa,Ackman says Allergan holders back takeover at $180/shr: CNBC,"(Reuters) - Allergan Inc shareholders have told activist investor William Ackman, who along with Valeant Pharmaceuticals is trying to buy Botox maker Allergan Inc that they would support a deal at $180 per share, Ackman said Monday. Valeant and Ackman, who owns almost 10 percent of Allergan through Pershing Square Capital Management, are in the midst of a hostile takeover battle for Allergan that began with a joint bid on April 22. Allergan rejected that first offer and Valeant responded by raising its offer on May 28 to about $163 per share. Investors did not think that offer was high enough and shares in both companies fell over doubts about the deal.  Ackman, speaking on CNBC in his first public appearance regarding the takeover attempt since it was announced, said that he met with Allergan shareholders on May 29 and was told they would support the deal at $180 per share. “We are going to take over Allergan,” Ackman said. The days after Ackman met with investors, May 30, Valeant raised its offer to include $72 in cash for a per share value of about $177 and a total value of more than $53 billion. In that offer, Ackman agreed to take only Valeant stock, freeing up Valeant to offer more cash to other shareholders. Ackman filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission to hold a special shareholder meeting to vote in new members of the Allergan board of directors. The current board has adopted a “poison pill” measure that will dilute shares if Ackman increases his Allergan stake. During the CNBC interview, Ackman defended Valeant’s business model, which has been criticized for its serial acquisitions, and his own purchase of Allergan shares. Ackman’s stake has increased by more than $1 billion since he purchased it before making the joint bid with Valeant, regulatory documents show. Allergan shares closed on Friday at $165 and Valeant shares closed at $127.46, both on the New York Stock Exchange.

650,BRKa,Gupta makes last-ditch bid to U.S. Supreme Court to avoid prison,"NEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc  director Rajat Gupta asked the U.S. Supreme Court to let him stay free while he appeals his insider trading conviction, in a last-ditch bid to avoid beginning his two-year prison term on June 17. In a request to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Gupta, 65, said he should remain free on bail, saying his appeal is “likely” to result in a reversal of his conviction and a new trial, and that he presents no risk of flight or danger to the community. The U.S. Department of Justice had no immediate comment. Gupta’s request was made public on Tuesday, 11 days after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York rejected his bid to stay free. The full appeals court has yet to decide whether to rehear Gupta’s appeal of his conviction. He intends to ask the Supreme Court to review his case if the appeals court refuses. Ginsburg handles emergency applications from the 2nd Circuit. She may rule herself on Gupta’s request or refer it to the full, nine-member Supreme Court. There is no deadline. Lawyers for Gupta include Seth Waxman, a former U.S. solicitor general. Gupta, also a former global managing director of the consulting firm McKinsey & Co, is the highest-ranking corporate official to be convicted in the government’s multiyear probe into insider trading in the hedge fund industry. A federal jury in Manhattan in June 2012 convicted him of passing tips about Goldman to his friend Raj Rajaratnam, founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund firm. Prosecutors said Gupta leaked inside information in 2008 about Goldman’s results and an unexpected $5 billion investment from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. In appealing his conviction, Gupta argued that wiretap evidence used against him should have been suppressed because the government failed to show probable cause and a necessity to obtain it. Gupta also argued that his trial judge, Jed Rakoff, should have told jurors that good character could raise a reasonable doubt of guilt and that federal appeals courts are divided about when to give such instructions. Rajaratnam is appealing his conviction to the Supreme Court. He is serving an 11-year prison term.

655,BRKa,Travelers ordered to pay over $500 mln in asbestos case,"NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday said Travelers Cos should pay more than $500 million to satisfy asbestos-related claims stemming from its coverage of policyholder Johns-Manville Corp, reversing a lower court ruling. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said U.S. District Judge John Koeltl erred in February 2012 when he concluded that the relevant conditions requiring payment had not been satisfied. Koeltl’s ruling reversed an earlier judgment by a federal bankruptcy judge that directed Travelers to make the payment. The 2nd Circuit ordered the reinstatement of that judgment. Now owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc , Johns-Manville had from the 1920s to 1970s been the largest U.S. maker of products containing asbestos.

656,BRKa,Berkshire profit soars 41 pct to a record on investment gains,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) on Friday said second-quarter profit soared 41 percent to a record high, reflecting substantial investment gains and improved results in manufacturing, service and retail businesses. “It’s clear that Warren Buffett’s bet on the U.S. economy is paying off,” said Michael Yoshikami, president of Destination Wealth Management in Walnut Creek, California, and a longtime Berkshire investor. Net income rose to $6.4 billion, or $3,889 per Class A share, from $4.54 billion, or $2,763 per share, a year earlier. Quarterly operating profit rose 11 percent to $4.33 billion, or $2,634 per Class A share, from $3.92 billion, or $2,384 per share. Analysts on average expected operating profit of $2,482 per Class A share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Book value per share, Buffett’s preferred measure of growth, has risen 5.6 percent this year to $142,483. Results included $1.96 billion of investment gains. Berkshire shed $2.86 billion of equities in the quarter, including a swap of a 40-year investment in former Washington Post publisher Graham Holdings Co (GHC.N) for a Miami television station and other assets. Accounting rules require Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire to report these sums with earnings, though Buffett considers the amounts in any given quarter often to be meaningless.    Berkshire owns more than 80 businesses in sectors including insurance, railroads, energy, chemicals, food and clothing.    Analysts have said the company’s increasing diversification over the years has made its fortunes more closely tied to the overall economy. The Commerce Department reported the U.S. economy grew at a 4 percent annual rate from April to June. Berkshire’s diversification helped in the quarter. While profit fell 8 percent in insurance, the company’s best known business sector, earnings from other businesses grew 20 percent. Profit grew 29 percent from manufacturing, service and retail operations, such as Berkshire’s Lubrizol chemicals and Forest River recreational vehicle units. Pre-tax profit doubled in apparel, helped by lower manufacturing and pension costs at Fruit of the Loom. Profit also increased 34 percent in energy and utilities, largely reflecting a year-end purchase of Nevada’s NV Energy. BNSF Railway’s profit grew 4 percent, but Berkshire expressed disappointment, saying, “Service levels continued to be well below our internal standards, as well as those expected by our customers.” Many insurance businesses also posted improved results, with larger underwriting gains from Geico auto insurance and General Re reinsurance, and in a business that provides commercial and worker’s compensation insurance. The insurance results were hurt by a small underwriting loss in a business that insures against major catastrophes, which Berkshire attributed mainly to currency fluctuations. “Insurance profit looked a little weak,” said Meyer Shields, managing director at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. “The rest of the business looked pretty good, which matches the slow-but-steady economic growth we keep hearing about.”  Berkshire’s cash stake surged to $55.46 billion from $48.95 billion at the end of March. That gives Buffett ammunition to make one or more large acquisitions, which he calls “elephants.” He has said he would partner on an acquisition, as in 2013 when Berkshire and Brazil’s 3G Capital teamed up to buy H.J. Heinz Co. Berkshire said it owns more than $119 billion of equities such as American Express Co (AXP.N), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N).In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares closed up $1,155 at $189,279.

Pre-tax profit doubled in apparel, helped by lower manufacturing and pension costs at Fruit of the Loom. Profit also increased 34 percent in energy and utilities, largely reflecting a year-end purchase of Nevada’s NV Energy. BNSF Railway’s profit grew 4 percent, but Berkshire expressed disappointment, saying, “Service levels continued to be well below our internal standards, as well as those expected by our customers.” Many insurance businesses also posted improved results, with larger underwriting gains from Geico auto insurance and General Re reinsurance, and in a business that provides commercial and worker’s compensation insurance. The insurance results were hurt by a small underwriting loss in a business that insures against major catastrophes, which Berkshire attributed mainly to currency fluctuations. “Insurance profit looked a little weak,” said Meyer Shields, managing director at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. “The rest of the business looked pretty good, which matches the slow-but-steady economic growth we keep hearing about.” Berkshire’s cash stake surged to $55.46 billion from $48.95 billion at the end of March. That gives Buffett ammunition to make one or more large acquisitions, which he calls “elephants.” He has said he would partner on an acquisition, as in 2013 when Berkshire and Brazil’s 3G Capital teamed up to buy H.J. Heinz Co. Berkshire said it owns more than $119 billion of equities such as American Express Co, Coca-Cola Co, International Business Machines Corp and Wells Fargo & Co. In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares closed up $1,155 at $189,279. Its Class B shares rose 40 cents to $125.83.

659,BRKa,Late surge lifts Wall Street; utilities sag,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks closed higher on Monday, lifted in a late rally driven by earnings from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and broad gains across most sectors that helped the S&P; 500 rebound from its largest weekly drop since 2012.  Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) gave the S&P; 500 its biggest boost, helping it snap a two-day losing streak and adding 0.8 of a point to the benchmark index’s gain. The company said late Friday that its second-quarter profit soared 41 percent to a record, which helped push its Class B shares up 3.1 percent to end at $129.72.  Despite a broad selloff last week, investors still have a bullish outlook on the markets, said Adam Hewison, president of INO.com in Annapolis, Maryland. “If you look at the backdrop of turmoil around the world, whether it’s Ukraine, Israel or Palestine, there hasn’t been much downward movement in the markets. We had a bad last week in July, but I think that’s basically over with, and we’re probably going to continue going higher in the equity markets,” Hewison said. Gains were partly offset by the S&P; utilities sector index .SPLRCU, which ended the day down 0.59 percent. It was the worst performer of the S&P;’s 10 sectors.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 75.91 points, or 0.46 percent, to end at 16,569.28. The S&P; 500 .SPX gained 13.84 points, or 0.72 percent, to 1,938.99. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 31.25 points, or 0.72 percent, to close at 4,383.89. Monday’s advance still left the Dow industrials in negative territory for the year. The blue-chip average ended Monday’s session just 7.38 points below its Dec. 31, 2013, close of 16,576.66, which was a record at the time. The U.S.-listed shares of Tekmira Pharmaceuticals TKMR.O slipped on Nasdaq in a roller-coaster day for the tech-heavy index. Tekmira was viewed as a possible provider of a treatment for an Ebola virus outbreak in Africa, but then CNN reported a drug from privately held Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc had helped at least two patients. Tekmira’s stock was up 18.3 percent on Nasdaq at one point, but finished down 7 percent at $13.26 a share. More than 9.8 million shares traded for the stock’s busiest day in its history.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc   said late Friday second-quarter profit soared 41 percent to a record high due to substantial investment gains and improved results in manufacturing, service and retail businesses. The company’s class B shares gained 2.6 percent to $129.08. Overall annual earnings growth for the second quarter so far has come in at 7.8 percent as reporting season starts to wind down. August tends to be a quieter month, and some investors expect the stock market to be a bit sleepy over the next few weeks. “The S&P; has had a huge run, and it’s earned the right to sit for a bit. The key is to make sure selling remains somewhat contained,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York. “We’re in a very strong bull market right now.” The S&P; 500 fell 2.7 percent last week, its biggest percentage drop since June 2012. Despite the sharp decline, the benchmark’s technical picture was still bullish, analysts said. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 29.41 points, or 0.18 percent, to 16,522.78, the S&P; 500 was up 8.48 points, or 0.44 percent, to 1,933.63, and the Nasdaq Composite  added 21.81 points, or 0.5 percent, to 4,374.45. Markets may retreat over the next few weeks as traders go on vacation and the Fed continues backing out of its bond-buying program, Sarhan said. “The real question becomes, will the Fed be able to transition and exit from QE3 gracefully?” Sarhan said. Utilities were the worst performing of the S&P;’s 10 industry sectors, down 1.2 percent. At its session low on Monday, the index was down 8.8 percent from its intraday record high set June 30. For the year, the sector has still gained 8.8 percent. Shares of Tekmira Pharmaceuticals fell 7.4 percent to $13.21, losing sharp gains from earlier in the day, after a CNN report suggested another company was first in line to see its Ebola treatment used to treat an outbreak in Africa. Pike Corp soared 48.5 percent to $11.82 after investment firm Court Square Capital Partners and Pike Chief Executive J. Eric Pike said they would take the company private.

666,BRKa,Fitch Rates Berkshire Hathaway Senior Debt Issue 'A+',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to the $750  million 2.1% senior unsecured notes issued by Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  (NYSE:BRK).  In addition, Fitch has assigned an 'A+' rating to the $400 million  of floating-rate senior unsecured notes issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance  Corp. (BHFC), which are guaranteed by BRK. The 'A+' ratings are equivalent to  Fitch's ratings on both BRK and BHFC's outstanding senior unsecured notes.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's ratings on BRK are supported by the extremely strong capitalization and  market position of its insurance subsidiaries, solid operating performance with  good diversification across business lines and excellent financial flexibility  and liquidity.   Also considered in the ratings are material equity market risk, insured natural  catastrophe exposures, growing exposure to asbestos and environmental risk and  various issues associated with the company's acquisition strategy.   BRK's consolidated financial leverage ratio was 24% as of June 30, 2014.   Consolidated interest coverage for the first half of 2014 was 8.2x excluding  realized investment gains.  Both financial leverage and interest coverage ratios  are not expected to change meaningfully given the issuances replaced debt that  matured in July and August 2014.   BRK's financial leverage ratio at the holding company level (including debt  issued by the company's finance company subsidiaries and guaranteed by BRK) was  14% at June 30, 2014. The agency views BRK's ability to fund finance operations  at a low cost as an important competitive advantage and also notes that much of  the finance company debt is guaranteed by BRK. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to a future downgrade include: --Deterioration in the credit quality of key insurance subsidiaries (National  Indemnity, GenRe, and GEICO) that is no longer consistent with the current 'AA+'  rating.  Measures of credit quality include Fitch's judgment of capitalization,  a total financing and commitments ratio greater than 1.5x, net leverage  (excluding affiliated investments) over 3.5x, or a sharp and persistent  reduction in underwriting profits;   --A consolidated run-rate financial leverage ratio that exceeds 30% or a  run-rate financial leverage ratio from the holding company, insurance and  finance operations (including debt issued or guaranteed by the holding company)  that exceeds 25%; --Material increases in leveraged equity market exposure such as its equity  index put derivative portfolio;    --Acquisitions or other actions that reduce outstanding cash below $10 billion  or approximately 5x consolidated interest expense. Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: --A commitment to lower debt-to-tangible capital ratios attributed to the  holding company, insurance and finance operations.  Fitch believes that this  would likely require the scaling back of the finance operations.   Fitch has assigned the following ratings: Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation  --$400 million floating-rate senior notes due August 2017 'A+'; Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.  --$750 million 2.1% senior notes due August 2019 'A+'.

669,BRKa,"Berkshire Hathaway stock hits new milestone at $200,000","(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s (BRKa.N) share price on Thursday surpassed and closed above $200,000 for the first time, the latest milestone for a company that Warren Buffett has built over nearly five decades into what some analysts view as a microcosm of the U.S. economy. Class A shares of Berkshire, which have never been split, closed up $3,500, or 1.8 percent, at $202,850, giving the Omaha, Nebraska-based company a market value of more than $333 billion. The share price had earlier rose as high as $203,025. Berkshire's share price has more than doubled since it first crossed the $100,000 barrier on Oct. 5, 2006. The Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX has climbed just 44 percent since that date. Buffett, who turns 84 on Aug. 30 and is the world’s third-richest person, oversees a conglomerate with more than 80 businesses ranging from Geico car insurance to the BNSF railroad to Dairy Queen ice cream, and more than $119 billion of stocks such as Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Coca-Cola Co (KO.N). In the second quarter, Berkshire Hathaway posted a record $6.4 billion profit, helped by a stock swap and growing earnings in many businesses, on revenue of $49.76 billion.  By some measures, Berkshire remains moderately priced, trading at about 1.4 times its book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, in the most recent quarter. Buffett has said he will consider buybacks only at or below a 1.2 times multiple. Berkshire also has lower-cost Class B shares, which Buffett launched in 1996 to thwart unit investment trusts purporting to be “clones” of Berkshire but which carried high costs. Those shares now trade at about 1/1,500th of a Class A share and carry voting rights equal to 1/10,000th of a Class A share. They closed on Thursday up $2.22, or 1.7 percent. at $135.30. Since 2006, Buffett has been donating Berkshire shares to several charities. He still owns about one-fifth of Berkshire, which was a failing textile company before he took it over in 1965, and controls about one-third of its voting power. Buffett’s net worth was about $66.3 billion after Thursday’s market close, Forbes magazine said.

670,BRKa,"Buffett's Berkshire reveals Charter stake, cuts DirecTV","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) disclosed a new  $366 million stake in cable TV operator Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) and pared its holdings in two other pay-TV companies, part of a flurry of changes in its stock investments during the second quarter. Shares of Charter shares rose about 2 percent after-hours after Berkshire reported a new 2.3 million share stake, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that detailed its domestic equity investments as of June 30. Charter is “the play of choice on cable consolidation,” said Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan.  “You’ve got a good story on an as-is basis and if they do more deals they can do a lot more value,” he said. DirecTV DTV.O is awaiting regulatory approval to sell itself to AT&T; (T.N) for $48.5 billion.     Charter declined to comment. A message left with DirecTV was not immediately answered. Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire reveals new  investments because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett and try to copy him. Berkshire did not disclose whether the Charter investment was made by Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Buffett has said he generally makes Berkshire’s larger investments such as Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), while other investments, especially in sectors he is less familiar with, are often made by Combs or Weschler, who have smaller sums to invest. Within the pay TV sector, Berkshire said its stake in DirecTV fell by about 11 million shares since the end of March to 23.5 million. It is also no longer reporting any stake in premium TV cable network Starz STRZA.O. The sales of stocks contributed to a significant increase during the quarter in Berkshire’s cash pile, which ended June at $55.5 billion. That gives Buffett power to make at least one big acquisition and still retain his desired $20 billion cushion. In Thursday’s filing, Berkshire reported a new stake in Now Inc (DNOW.N), an energy distribution business recently spun off from oilfield equipment provider National Oilwell Varco Inc (NOV.N), whose stock Berkshire also owns. Among the companies in which Berkshire reported higher share stakes were General Motors Corp (GM.N), IBM Corp (IBM.N), Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO), Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N). It also reported lower holdings in many companies, including oil company ConocoPhillips (COP.N), former Washington Post owner Graham Holdings Co (GHC.N), National Oilwell Varco, and former Starz owner Liberty Media Corp LMCA.O. U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter, and the disclosures can offer a window to their strategies for buying and selling stocks.

Gains were broad, with all but one of the S&P;’s 10 primary sector indexes rising for the day. An S&P; index of healthcare stocks gained 1.2 percent and led the advance, while an index of energy stocks dragged, slipping 0.5 percent. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would stand up for itself but not at the cost of confrontation with the outside world, striking a softer tone after tough rhetoric aimed at Ukraine for several months. The market had been pressured in recent weeks by uncertainty over the conflict. Earnings season continued to wind down, with 92 percent of S&P; 500 companies having reported quarterly earnings by Thursday morning. Of the companies that have reported results so far, 67.7 percent beat analysts’ expectations. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the nation’s largest retailer, reported earnings and revenue that met expectations. But the company cut its forecast for coming quarters. The Dow component’s stock rose 0.5 percent to $74.39. Shares of Cisco Systems Inc, another Dow component, fell 2.6 percent to $24.54. The network equipment maker gave a tepid outlook for its current quarter and announced massive job cuts despite reporting revenue that beat expectations. The stock market has looked past flaring tensions abroad to rally for an extended period, with the S&P; 500 marking more than 1,000 days since its last correction, which Wall Street defines as a drop of 10 percent from the most recent high. “In October, the Fed is going to get away from money printing, and since we haven’t had a correction in a long time, it could undermine things very quickly once people realize growth isn’t in line with their expectations,” said Jeff Duncan, president of Duncan Financial Management in Sunset Hills, Missouri. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 61.78 points, or 0.37 percent, to close at 16,713.58. The S&P; 500  gained 8.46 points, or 0.43 percent, to finish at 1,955.18. The Nasdaq Composite added 18.88 points, or 0.43 percent, to end at 4,453.00. Shares of Boeing Co shot up 1.7 percent to $124.11, making it the Dow’s second-biggest gainer. The company said demand for its commercial jetliners was very strong and signaled it is getting close to deciding whether to further accelerate output. The price of Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s Class A stock crossed $200,000 for the first time on Thursday in the latest milestone for the company that Warren Buffett built over nearly five decades. Berkshire Hathaway closed at $202,850, up 1.8 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. After the bell, shares of Nordstrom Inc slid 1.7 percent. The upscale department store chain, known for its selection of fashion labels and customer service, reported second-quarter earnings in line with expectations and a 3 percent increase in same-store sales. JC Penney Co Inc shares initially rose 7 percent to $10.40 in extended-hours trading before falling to unchanged from the NYSE close at $9.74. After the bell, the department store chain reported quarterly sales rose 5 percent while its quarterly loss narrowed to 56 cents per share. Shares of Monster Beverage Corp soared 30 percent to $71.65 in extended-hours trading on news that the energy drink maker entered a long term partnership with Coca-Cola Co. During the regular session, Red Robin Gourmet Burgers  had its worst trading day since November 2006. The burger chain reported quarterly earnings and revenue sharply below expectations, sending its stock tumbling 18.5 percent to $52.63. About 4.7 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, compared with the five-day average of 5.4 billion.

678,BRKa,UPDATE 2-Heinz to tighten supplier controls in China after infant food scare,"* Heinz says to tighten supplier controls after China food scare * Watchdog finds excess lead levels in some Heinz infant products * Firm says no other Heinz baby food products affected * Chinese parents sensitive over baby food products - analysts   (Adds further Heinz statement) By Adam Jourdan and Sui-Lee Wee SHANGHAI/BEIJING, Aug 19 (Reuters) - U.S. foodmaker H.J. Heinz Co said on Tuesday it will tighten controls over ingredients suppliers in China after it was forced to recall some infant food products from Chinese store shelves due to excess levels of lead. The company, known globally for its ketchup and baked beans, made the annoucement as it sought to contain the potential damage to its reputation in a country where consumers are highly sensitive to food safety after a series of high-profile scares. Heinz told Reuters on Monday that it had recalled four batches of its AD Calcium Hi-Protein Cereal for infants after a food watchdog in eastern China found levels of the toxic heavy metal above regulation standards. Supply chains issues in China have come under increased scrutiny, with KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and McDonald’s Corp all recently facing food safety issues with suppliers. Consumers in China are especially sensitive to baby products after powdered milk tainted with the industrial chemical melamine led to the deaths of at least six infants in 2008. “I would think that Heinz is in a lot of trouble right now because parents are unforgiving of any quality control problems in baby and infant food products,” said Shaun Rein, Shanghai-based managing director of China Market Research Group. Heinz will draft stricter systems for regulating ingredient suppliers and improve traceability and food safety control measures along its supply chain, the U.S. company said in a post on its official Sina Weibo microblog on Tuesday. Affected products had been sealed and would would be destroyed under regulator guidance, it added. An official at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in Zhejiang province declined to give details on the levels of lead in the Heinz cereal, but said that it would release further information about the case in the coming days. Standard levels for infant products should be below 0.2 milligrams per kg, according to a 2010 government report. Heinz, which was bought out by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and private equity firm 3G Capital last year, said the recall was a precautionary measure. The company added that the high lead level was caused “accidentally” by a supplier who had provided a skimmed soybean powder ingredient used in the batch of cereal. “This relates to an isolated regional withdrawal in eastern China,” company spokesman Michael Mullen said in emailed comments to Reuters. “Extensive testing confirmed that no other Heinz baby food varieties are affected.” Heinz did not respond to phone and email requests for further comment on Tuesday. The Zhejiang FDA has said the problem affected 1,472 boxes of cereal in the province and that Heinz had told the agency it would destroy another 153 boxes that are sealed in a warehouse in the southern city of Guangzhou. Heinz said in its Weibo statement that it would compensate any consumers who had bought the affected product. The cereal is aimed at infants aged between six months and three years, according to the packaging. It also apologised for inconvenience caused to consumers and moved to assure shoppers that the firm was committed to food quality and safety. Foreign brands do well in China’s baby food market, because parents are willing to pay a premium to guarantee quality and safety. The market, excluding infant milk formula, is worth around 8 billion yuan ($1.3 billion), according to a May report from Huidian Research. However, food safety scares are relatively common in China with Yum, retailer Wal-Mart and French dairy Danone SA  all taking a hit in the last year over food safety concerns. Chinese parents are already highly sensitive to metal contamination in food, which is often linked to the country’s high levels of soil and water pollution, one of the main ways metals gets into cereals and other crops. Analysts said the presence of lead - widely known by parents to be harmful for children - would create a “scare factor” even if no people suffered adverse effects from the products. China has previously had issues of cadmium and lead metals in food. Consumers took to China’s Twitter-like microblog Weibo on Tuesday, questioning whether the recall was just the beginning of the issue, while others said they were concerned about long-term effects on their children. Experts say exposure to lead is particularly dangerous for children, inhibiting intellectual and physical development. It can cause poor concentration, disruptive behaviour and even death when subjected to high levels. A soil survey in April showed that nearly a fifth of China’s farmland was contaminated by toxic heavy metals and chemicals, and that more than 33,000 sq km (12,740 sq miles) - an area the size of Belgium - were unfit for agricultural use.

679,BRKa,"Buffett hoards cash, individuals' holdings hit 14-year low","(Reuters) - Individual investors have been cutting back on cash in portfolios, the exact reverse of what Warren Buffett has been doing at Berkshire Hathaway.  Who do you think has got it right? Cash at Berkshire Hathaway stood at just over $55 billion as of June 30, an all-time high and two and a half times the level he’s in the past said he likes to keep on tap to meet extraordinary claims at his insurance businesses. That’s also up more than 50 percent from a year ago. Buffett’s green pile is in sharp contrast to individual investors, who’ve cut cash in portfolios to 15.8 percent, a 14-year low, according to the July asset allocation survey from the American Association of Individual Investors. To be sure, businesses and individuals hold cash for different reasons, but Buffett has used Berkshire, in part, as an investment vehicle through which we can interpret his views on markets, or at least the prices of some assets in them. Berkshire, of course, has some difficulties in putting cash to work not faced by your average dentist or lawyer, in that it tends to make very large investments and as such may need to be more patient than smaller fry. So it is quite possible Berkshire Hathaway is waiting for the right acquisition to come along. It is also similarly possible that Buffett is not happy with the prices, and is biding his time against a day when prices have been marked down. One thing not influencing Berkshire is tax policy, as all of its cash is generated in the U.S., making it not one of the legion of corporations holding money offshore to avoid a repatriation tax. Bottom line though is that the best investor in the world is going in exactly the opposite direction to a class of people often reputed to be among the worst. Cash returns are, as we know, lousy; the little that one can get in liquid instruments inevitably being lower than the toll extracted by inflation. And indeed the long-term returns on cash are terrible, lagging behind every asset class and investment strategy this side of setting money on fire. Still, looking at the long-term returns on cash and concluding it is a tool to be shunned is a bit like saying a golfer ought not to have a back swing because only forward momentum drives the ball. Cash is the thing which puts you in a position to drive the ball, and gives your investment swing power. Its value lies not so much in itself but in the ease with which it can be turned into other things. Cash is worth holding because it is dry powder which gives the owner options. That optionality varies, of course, based on your view of how richly valued assets are, but it is always there.  Cash also provides investors with what so many hedge funds and other expensive financial products claim to provide: protection against the downside. James Montier, of fund managers GMO, calls cash “perhaps the oldest, easiest and most underrated source of tail risk protection.” If you are worried, as small investors seem not to be, about the small possibility of large impact events, then cash has a value not expressed by its yield. Montier also argued, in a 2011 paper, that cash provides decent protection against both inflation and deflation, citing the experience of the U.S. inflation of the 1970s and Japan since 1990. During the 70s cash was a bit worse than equities as inflation soared, but a bit better than bonds. In Japan, in contrast, cash did much worse than bonds, but, as goods and services declined in price, did far, far better than stocks. But really if cash has something to recommend it in the current environment, it is its optionality in a time of uncertainty. The odd thing about the current market is how calm it is in the face of fairly unprecedented conditions. We’ve never before been through a lift-off from zero rates or a running down of a massive Federal Reserve balance sheet. Likewise, we’ve never run into a recession while also being at the zero lower bound for interest rates. Any of the above is possible in the next 12 to 24 months, and yet markets aren’t even close to pricing these risks. While it may never happen, and we might want to cheer up, Buffett is arguably better positioned with his cash roll if it does than the small investors who are nearly as heavily invested as they’ve been this millennium.

680,BRKa,"UPDATE 3-U.S. fines Berkshire over stock deal, Buffett admits mistake","(Adds Buffett admitting mistake) By Jonathan Stempel Aug 20 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc  agreed to pay an $896,000 fine to settle U.S. government accusations that it violated antitrust rules by failing to report a transaction that boosted its stake in building products company USG Corp. The civil penalty, which requires court approval, settles charges made on Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission that Berkshire violated the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust law by not telling regulators about the Dec. 9, 2013 transaction in advance. That law requires regulatory approval for some transactions, and is designed to help protect competition. Berkshire corrected its error on Jan. 3, 2014. “We made a mistake when we overlooked the filing requirement,” Buffett, who is chairman and chief executive of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, said in a statement. Berkshire had on Dec. 9, 2013, exchanged $243.8 million of USG convertible notes for 21.39 million common shares, giving it a roughly 28 percent stake in USG worth more than $950 million. Regulators said that Berkshire was required to report the exchange in advance because the new stake was more than three times the minimum required, but failed to do so. Buffett said “we were late” in realizing that a report was necessary. The transaction occurred four days after the FTC decided not to punish Berkshire for a similar “inadvertent” violation involving financial services company Symetra Financial Corp , relying on Berkshire’s assurance that it would comply with Hart-Scott-Rodino. “Although we may not seek penalties for every inadvertent error, we will enforce the rules when the same party makes additional mistakes after promises of improved oversight,” Deborah Weinstein, director of the FTC bureau of competition, said in a statement. Berkshire had been a large holder of USG stock when it bought the convertible notes in November 2008. The notes had a 10 percent interest rate, the same rate that Berkshire got when it invested a total of $8 billion in Goldman Sachs Group Inc and General Electric Co at around the same time. Those investments came in the wake of the financial crisis, and gave Berkshire a reputation as a lender of last resort when financial markets come under strain. Berkshire operates more than 80 businesses and holds more than $119 billion of equity investments. The $896,000 penalty represents about a half-hour of operating earnings, based on the company’s reported $15.14 billion of operating profit for 2013. Buffett, 83, owns about one-fifth of Berkshire and according to Forbes magazine is the world’s third-richest person.

685,BRKa,Heinz recall brings food tracking issue to the fore in China,"SHANGHAI, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The entanglement of H.J. Heinz Co. in China’s latest food scare highlights a key concern for international and local firms - how to keep track of ingredients from diverse sources in a country where food supply tracing technologies are far from the norm. The U.S. food maker apologised to Chinese consumers last week and said it would tighten controls over suppliers after it was forced to recall some infant cereal from store shelves due to excess levels of lead. Food safety scares erupt regularly in China - KFC parent Yum Brands Inc, McDonald’s Corp, Wal-Mart Stores Inc  and Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd have all suffered recently - and such incidents can seriously dent sales. But barcode tracking systems for produce, common in the United States and Europe, are largely absent. “Standardized traceability of food products does not currently exist in China. It’s a long way from it,” said David Mahon, Beijing-based managing director of an investment firm focusing on China’s food and beverage sectors. China’s food traceability systems and regulation were classified as “poor” in an August report from the Institute of Food Technologists. This was the lowest score of around 20 countries included. Food safety barcodes store details such as the farm of origin, dates of harvest, planting, storage and shipment, meaning clients down the line can trace a particular batch and find out how and why any issues occurred. Some firms have tried to bring the system into wider use in China - French grocer Carrefour SA launched a barcoding system last year for fruit and vegetables - but the technology has failed to catch on due to the high costs of implementation throughout scattered supply chains. Heinz said it had identified the supplier and ingredient - a skimmed soybean powder - responsible for the recall of four batches of its AD Calcium Hi-Protein Cereal from stores in eastern China, but added the firm needed to do more to keep suppliers in check. “We will keep improving traceable food safety control systems from ‘farm to factory’,” Heinz said in a statement posted on its Chinese website. Heinz, which was bought out by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and private equity firm 3G Capital last year, did not respond to requests for further comment. Consumers in China are highly sensitive to issues of food safety, especially with baby products, after powdered milk tainted with the industrial chemical melamine led to the deaths of at least six infants in 2008. Danone SA and Abbott Laboratories saw infant formula sales in China plunge last year after concerns over a potentially fatal bacteria in a supplier’s product. Tests later showed the initial finding was incorrect. China has soaring levels of soil and water pollution, with seven out of the top 10 farming provinces amongst the areas most exposed to heavy metal pollution such as lead, according to a March report from HSBC. Major firms, including fast food chains McDonald’s and Burger King Worldwide Inc, said they had put in place stringent testing and auditing procedures in China to avoid issues such as contamination from water and soil pollution. “We have rigorous and overlapping internal and external testing procedures and audits to ensure that our suppliers in China, and around the world, meet our strict specifications,” said Vijay Guyah, a Singapore-based spokesman for Burger King. Agricultural supply chains in China tend to be highly fragmented with most farms still small-scale. Even with stringent auditing processes of suppliers - which multinational firms such as Heinz would carry out - it’s difficult to keep track of all suppliers along the line, some of whom may be tempted to subcontract to cut costs. What’s more, while China’s regulators have tight food safety rules, industry insiders said the watchdogs simply did not have the manpower to properly enforce them. “It’s not that the technology doesn’t exist in China, it’s just the chains are too fragmented,” said an industry executive in China, who previously ran a food processing plant serving multinational firms in China and abroad. The former executive said that one batch of frozen vegetables that his firm shipped to the Japanese market had become contaminated by chemicals after an audited, long-term supplier topped up its harvest from a neighbouring farm. “When supply chains are so large, you can’t always prevent a supplier buying from someone else if someone else has a cheaper price,” the former executive said. “It’s a matter of one guy doing things wrong and the product is contaminated.”   (Reporting by Adam Jourdan; Editing by Alex Richardson)",8252014,http://www.reuters.com/article/china-foodsafety/heinz-recall-brings-food-tracking-issue-to-the-fore-in-china-idUSL4N0QS2RQ20140825

""I think his last ten years is not as good as his first 20 years - but...when you get big it's hard to continue to grow,"" said Benmosche, who currently serves as an adviser to the insurer. (bloom.bg/1sXDBie) The AIG-Berkshire rivalry heated up last year when AIG decided to stop signing new reinsurance contracts with Berkshire due to competitive reasons. The decision came after Berkshire poached senior AIG executives, and Buffett said he planned to expand his company’s commercial insurance operations that compete with AIG. Benmosche, who was diagnosed with cancer in 2010, sped up his exit from AIG after he learnt in May that he had nine months to a year to live.

Berkshire Hathaway did not disclose terms of the agreement, but said in a statement that the dealership would be known as Berkshire Hathaway Automotive after completion of the sale. “It’s reconfirmation of the overarching theme,” said Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management and a Berkshire investor.  “And that is, he wants to put himself in the way of making a pile of money as the millennials emerge from their extended adolescence into being married parents,” starting families of their own. “Domestic, domestic, domestic,” Smead said.

Referring to Maria Elena Lagomasino, chair of Coca-Cola’s compensation committee, Buffett said, “I tip my hat to her.” Buffett said he felt as good as ever about his investment in Coca-Cola. He told CNBC earlier this year he had abstained from a shareholder vote on its controversial equity compensation plan when it came up for renewal in April, even though he considered it excessive.

706,BRKa,CORRECTED-UPDATE 4-Blackstone gives up its roots in advisory unit spin-off,"(Corrects 21st paragraph to show it is referring to Studzinski and not Taubman, and adds a dropped word in 23rd paragraph) By Greg Roumeliotis and Paritosh Bansal NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP said on Friday it would spin off its advisory units into a company headed by star Wall Street investment banker Paul Taubman, to avoid potential conflicts of interest in the sprawling private equity empire. The advisory business, which includes mergers and acquisitions, restructuring and private equity fundraising, will merge with a firm founded last year by Taubman, a former Morgan Stanley president who has been behind some of the biggest mergers in recent years. The new publicly traded company could be valued at $1 billion to $2 billion, a person close to Blackstone said. The tax-free spin-off is expected in 2015. The surprise move is a stark example of potential conflicts of interest that could arise in companies with unwieldy, sprawling interests and attract regulatory scrutiny. Blackstone started three decades ago as an advisory business, but has since grown into a diversified alternative asset manager with more than $300 billion under management in private equity, real estate, credit and other assets. There is no suggestion that any specific regulatory action led to Blackstone’s decision. The firm said its primary business, which includes buying and selling companies and real estate assets, as well as lending to such companies and buying their debt, places restrictions on the use of its advisory arms, hindering their growth. The advisory business is a small part of the firm, accounting for about $185 million of Blackstone’s total revenue of $3.7 billion in the first half of the year. Blackstone has a market value of $34 billion. Blackstone said the timing is right for the spinoff: M&A; is picking up, restructuring remains an active business, private equity fundraising is on the rise, and Taubman is available. “This has the potential to unlock value for our shareholders,” Blackstone co-founder and Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman told analysts on a conference call. Blackstone’s shares ended down 0.6 percent at $29.6 on Friday. The new company, whose name has yet to be decided, will advise companies on mergers and acquisitions as well as debt restructurings. It will also help private equity and other alternative investment funds with their fundraising efforts. Blackstone’s current shareholders will own 65 percent of the new publicly listed company. Taubman, his firm’s partners and Blackstone’s advisory employees will own the rest. Taubman, who left Morgan Stanley in 2012 and founded his own firm last year, has been behind some of the biggest deals of the past few years. These include advising Verizon Communications Inc on its $130 billion takeover of its wireless joint venture with the UK’s Vodafone Group Plc, and Comcast Corp on its $42 billion deal to buy Time Warner Cable Inc. Blackstone President Tony James approached Taubman with the idea of partnering in late spring, according to Taubman. A meeting between Schwarzman, James and Taubman soon followed. Blackstone started sensing limits to the advisory business’ growth as part of the firm, as questions of potential conflicts of interest came into sharper focus after the financial crisis. During the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008, for example, Blackstone’s real estate division was eyeing some of the bank’s assets. As a result, Blackstone had to tell its advisory bankers not to pursue a role in what they saw as one of the most complex and interesting opportunities of the last decade. Investments of Blackstone’s credit arm, GSO Capital Partners, have also curtailed its advisory arm, which ranks as the world’s most active debt restructuring advisor according to Thomson Reuters data. Executives started talking about the idea over the last couple of years. Tim Coleman, who heads Blackstone’s restructuring team, and Daniel Prendergast, CEO of Park Hill, will keep their roles and join the new company. Park Hill is a private equity fund placement agent that Blackstone acquired in 2005. John Studzinski, who heads the advisory business, will help with the transition, but remain at Blackstone. Studzinski joined Blackstone in 2006 and has been personally involved in many of the firm’s largest advisory assignments. Studzinski, who boasts relationships with governments, corporations, pension funds and wealthy individuals across the globe, will remain on the executive committee of Blackstone and advise the firm. Blackstone was founded by Schwarzman and the now-retired Peter Peterson in 1985 with $400,000 as an M&A; advisory boutique. It was not until 1987 that the firm launched its first private equity fund, and then set up its debt restructuring business in 1991. Over the years, the advisory business has undertaken some of Wall Street’s most prestigious investment banking mandates, including advising Bank of America Corp on the $5 billion investment it received from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and American International Group Inc  on its government bailout. Yet, in recent years, the advisory business has not been a meaningful earnings contributor to Blackstone, with other assets such as real estate investments and leveraged buyouts bringing in the bulk of the firm’s profits. It is not the first time Blackstone has let a business go. BlackRock Inc was spun out of Blackstone in 1992, subsequently growing into the world’s largest money manager and leading Schwarzman to public acknowledge that decision as a mistake. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP is advising Blackstone and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP is advising Taubman’s firm, PJT Partners, on the transaction.

707,BRKa,"Bid report lifts CSX stock, but analysts skeptical of deal","CHICAGO, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Shares of No. 3 U.S. railroad CSX Corp rose nearly 10 percent on Monday following a report of a rebuffed takeover bid by Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd, but analysts said any such deal would face significant regulatory and other hurdles. According to the report in the Wall Street Journal late on Sunday, the No. 2 Canadian railroad made a bid last week for Jacksonville, Florida-based CSX, which rejected the offer. Both companies said they did not comment on market rumors. Shares in Canadian Pacific were not traded Monday as the markets in Canada were closed for a holiday. In a client note, Cowen & Co analyst Jason Seidl wrote that Canadian Pacific could in theory team up with hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management and take a bid directly to CSX shareholders. Activist investor William Ackman, who runs Pershing Square, in 2012 had recruited Hunter Harrison, who had previously been chief executive officer of Canadian National Railway Co , for that post at Canadian Pacific. But Seidl said any deal was unlikely in the near term since shippers and regulators were “disenchanted” with the rail industry because of its service and capacity problems. Severe weather last winter wreaked havoc on the major railroads’ networks, while the rise in oil-by-rail shipments has caused delays for grain shippers. Harrison has indicated that mergers could be a way to alleviate network congestion and improve service. Any merger would have to be approved by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board. Seth Bloom, president of Washington-based Bloom Strategic Counsel and former general counsel of the U.S. Senate Antitrust Subcommittee, said the STB was “pretty tough,” but might not find a deal anti-competitive since Canadian Pacific is not one of the four major U.S. railroads. However, the Association of American Railroads industry lobby group considers both Canadian National and Canadian Pacific “Class I” railroads because of their extensive U.S. holdings. In a note for clients, Credit Suisse analyst Allison Landry wrote that STB rules for mergers between Class I railroads had “an arguably impossible hurdle rate. “Therefore, in our opinion, the deal is a non-starter.” Harrison was at Canadian National when it tried to merge with BNSF, which is now owned by investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, in 2000. The STB rejected that deal due to concerns over competition. Many companies have complained over the years about the prices railroads charge to haul freight. Analysts therefore expect shippers to oppose any merger on the grounds that it would drive up prices and reduce competition. The other major railroads are also seen as being generally against any Class I mergers. “We stand with the consensus here,” independent analyst Anthony Hatch wrote in a note. “The risks - economic, operational and, enormously, political (especially now) outweigh the benefits.” But Cowen & Co analyst Seidl said:  “If a merger does occur, others will likely follow.”    (Reporting by Nick Carey; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)",10132014,http://www.reuters.com/article/canadianpacific-csx-stocks/bid-report-lifts-csx-stock-but-analysts-skeptical-of-deal-idUSL2N0S80WD20141013

The filing, published on Thursday, said that on Oct. 13 Berkshire reduced its Tesco holding to “less than 3 percent”.

711,BRKa,Buffett copycats risk a pounding as Berkshire portfolio suffers,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - It’s not been a good time for Warren Buffett wannabes. Sharp drops in many of the stocks owned by Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway in recent weeks hit the sprawling conglomerate’s equity portfolio hard. The loss on seven of those holdings alone totals more than $5 billion provided Berkshire’s stakes have remained the same since June 30, the last date for which they were disclosed. In particular, Berkshire’s been stung by large holdings in IBM and long-time Buffett favorite Coca-Cola, both of which tumbled after disappointing third-quarter results. His penchant for energy stocks hasn’t helped either, given the damage done to the prices of energy assets by the slumping global oil price. For the world’s third richest man, unrealized losses of a few billion dollars aren’t necessarily anything to cry about. Buffett’s ability to sit tight and ride out short-term market gyrations has been one of the keys to his success as a long-term investor. And unlike, say, mutual fund managers, he doesn’t have to worry about redemptions forcing him to sell stock. But for others - fund managers, smaller institutions, even retail investors - who often try to follow in Buffett’s footsteps, the losses could be harder to get over. Berkshire Hathaway did not respond to requests for comment. With 400 million shares of Coke on June 30, Berkshire is the company’s largest shareholder - and Buffett is perhaps the world’s most famous Cherry Coke fan. “I love Coke, I love the management,” he said in a television interview in April, as the company faced a controversy over an executive compensation plan.  Coke shares plunged 6 percent on Oct. 21 after it said that quarterly profit slumped. The shares are down 4.1 percent since June 30 for a possible paper loss to Berkshire of $696 million.  Similarly, IBM - of which Berkshire held about 70 million shares on June 30 - is down about 11 percent since the end of the second quarter, with much of that decline occurring after it ditched its 2015 operating earnings target this week. Since June 30, IBM’s slump may has cost Berkshire nearly $1.3 billion on paper. Short-seller Doug Kass has repeatedly pointed to both of those companies as weak spots in Berkshire’s portfolio. Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management in Palm Beach, Florida, was named Buffett’s “credentialed bear” for the 2013 Berkshire Hathaway shareholders’ meeting. To spice up proceedings at the gathering, which is attended by thousands of Berkshire shareholders, Buffett got Kass to present the bear case against the conglomerate, which owns dozens of businesses selling everything from ice cream to insurance. “Very few people have the sort of pain threshold and long-term time frame and risk appetite that Warren Buffett has,” Kass said. “His risk profile is different than a mere mortal.” Among the other stocks that were in Berkshire’s portfolio at June 30 that have dropped significantly are banking group Wells Fargo, credit card group American Express, energy giant Exxon Mobil, Canadian oil producer Suncor Energy and automaker General Motors. Exxon often sees its fate tied to the price of oil. With crude down about 18 percent so far this year, Buffett’s 41 million shares of Exxon at June 30 would be worth almost $311 million less now. Earlier this month, Berkshire Hathaway said that it had sold off some of its stake in troubled British grocer Tesco, taking it to below 3 percent from around 3.96 percent of Tesco’s shares in May.  Those shares are off 45 percent this year in the wake of its worsening performance, exacerbated by an accounting scandal. Buffett himself called that investment a “huge mistake.” Because Berkshire Hathaway owns stock in dozens of companies, several of its holdings are performing better. Retail behemoth Wal-Mart, for example, is up 1.3 percent since the end of the second quarter. And consumer products maker Procter & Gamble is up 7.2 percent from June 30 to Oct. 22.  For all its substantial portfolio holdings, the cornerstone of Berkshire Hathaway’s earnings comes from the dozens of businesses it controls, including insurance company Geico and railroad BNSF. Those companies and others helped bring Berkshire’s profit last year to a record $19.48 billion. Nor have investors punished Berkshire Hathaway’s own stock for the recent market gyrations. The class A shares of the conglomerate are up 16 percent this year, and up 8.75 percent since the second quarter.   That handily beats the S&P; 500’s tepid 4.3 percent gain so far this year.   Last year, for the first time since Buffett took control of Berkshire in 1965, the company’s five-year gain in book value per share underperformed the S&P; 500’s five-year rise, including dividends but before tax. But Buffett has often said that Berkshire Hathaway will do best against the index in lackluster or even down markets. In recent years, stocks have been surging. And Buffett’s preferred holding time of forever is well known, with the so-called Oracle of Omaha an advocate of buy-and-hold strategies for everyone from himself through Mom-and-Pop retail investors. Indeed, Buffett himself has often praised falling markets as buying opportunities. “Tumbling markets can be helpful to the true investor if he has cash available when prices get far out of line with values,” he wrote in his annual letter to shareholders this year.  “A climate of fear is your friend when investing; a euphoric world is your enemy.” ",10232014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-buffett-portfolio/buffett-copycats-risk-a-pounding-as-berkshire-portfolio-suffers-idUSKCN0IC0CL20141023

717,BRKa,Fitch Affirms Ratings of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 31 (Fitch)  Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'AA-' Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) and the 'AA+' Insurer  Financial Strength (IFS) ratings on BRK's key insurance subsidiaries.  The  Rating Outlook is Stable.  A complete list of ratings and rating actions is  shown at the end of this release.    KEY RATING DRIVERS: Fitch's ratings are supported by BRK's extremely strong capitalization and  market position of its insurance subsidiaries, solid operating performance with  good diversification across business lines, and excellent financial flexibility  and liquidity.   Also considered in the ratings are material equity market risk, insured natural  catastrophe exposures, growing exposure to asbestos and environmental risk, and  various issues associated with the company's acquisition strategy.   BRK's large market position, size and scale are consistent with Fitch's 'AA' IFS  rating category. The capitalization of BRK's insurance operations is considered 'Extremely  Strong' as measured by Fitch's Prism capital model and is heavily weighted in  the company's current rating. BRK's consolidated financial leverage ratio was 24% as of June 30, 2014.  BRK's  financial leverage ratio at the holding company level (including debt issued by  the company's finance company subsidiaries and guaranteed by BRK) was 14% at  June 30, 2014. The agency views BRK's ability to fund finance operations at a  low cost as an important competitive advantage for the finance operations and  also notes that much of the finance company debt is guaranteed by BRK. Fitch's expectation is that BRK's major non-insurance business units, including  the company's utilities and railroad business, will service their own debt. BRK reported net income of $11.1 billion for the first half of 2014 (1H'14), up  from $9.4 billion in the comparable period of 2013.  BRK's insurance group  reported $3.8 billion in earnings before tax in 1H'14, accounting for roughly  one-third of BRK's $11.8 billion in pre-tax earnings.  Investment gains were  primarily responsible for the period-to-period increase in earnings.   The Burlington Northern and Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad operation continues to make  significant contributions to earnings.  BNSF reported a pretax gain of $2.6  billion (22% of BRK's total pre-tax earnings) for the first six months of 2014,  relatively unchanged from the comparable period in 2013. BRK's 1H'14 annualized return on equity was 9.8%, excluding unrealized gains on  fixed income securities, level from the comparable period of 2013.   Consolidated GAAP interest coverage for the first six months of 2014 was 8.2x,  which is below Fitch's expectation of 12x for companies at BRK's rating level.   Somewhat offsetting this is approximately $27 billion of cash and equivalents at  the insurance operating companies at June 30, 2014, which would cover annual  interest expense by 8x.   BRK's GAAP-basis earnings will continue to be exposed to earnings volatility  given the large notional values and long duration of BRK's outstanding  derivative contracts. Additionally, Fitch believes that BRK's earnings will be  exposed to potential volatility from the company's reinsurance businesses and  its exposure to catastrophe-related losses as well as the company's large equity  investment portfolio. BRK has grown its asbestos & environmental insured liability exposure through  retroactive reinsurance contracts most notably with Equitas Limited, Swiss Re,  CNA Financial Corp, AIG and Liberty Mutual.  Fitch estimates BRK has  approximately $13 billion in A&E; reserves at year-end 2013 and these reserves  covered average paid losses by greater than 14x. RATING SENSITIVITIES: Key rating triggers that could lead to a future downgrade include: --Deterioration in the credit quality of key insurance subsidiaries (National  Indemnity, GenRe, and GEICO) that is no longer consistent with the current 'AA+'  rating.  Measures of credit quality include Fitch's judgment of capitalization,  a total financing and commitments ratio greater than 1.5x, net leverage  (excluding affiliated investments) over 3.5x or a sharp and persistent reduction  in underwriting profits.   --A consolidated run-rate debt-to-total capital ratio that exceeds 30% or a  run-rate debt-to-total capital ratio from the holding company, insurance and  finance operations (including debt issued or guaranteed by the holding company)  that exceeds 25%. --Material increases in leveraged equity market exposure such as its equity  index put derivative portfolio.    --Acquisitions or other actions that reduce outstanding cash below $10 billion  or approximately 5x consolidated interest expense.      Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: A commitment to lower debt-to-tangible capital ratios attributed to the holding  company, insurance and finance operations.  Fitch believes that this would  likely require the scaling back of the finance operations.

718,BRKa,"Berkshire third-quarter profit drops on investments, operating results gain","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) on Friday said third-quarter profit fell 9 percent as it took a large writeoff on one of its investments, but operating results easily topped forecasts amid improvement in its insurance, energy and railroad operations.    Net income slipped to $4.62 billion, or $2,811 per Class A share in the third quarter, from $5.05 billion, or $3,074 per Class A share, a year earlier. Operating profit, however, rose 29 percent to $4.72 billion, or $2,876 per Class A share, from $3.66 billion, or $2,228 per Class A share. Analysts on average expected earnings of $2,593.85 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Much of the drop in earnings is attributable to Berkshire posting a $107 million loss on investments and derivatives, compared with a year-earlier $1.39 billion gain. During the quarter, Berkshire wrote off $678 million on its investment in Tesco Plc (TSCO.L), a British grocery chain being probed by regulators at home over accounting errors.   Buffett has been reducing Berkshire’s Tesco stake. In contrast, year-earlier results included big gains on investments that Buffett made during the 2008 financial crisis, including in General Electric Co (GE.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), and bonds related to candy maker Mars Inc’s purchase of rival Wrigley. Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, said the change took a backseat to the strength of operations at Berkshire’s more than 80 companies.  “There are some line items in here that just scream operating success,” said Smead, whose firm owns 333,000 Class B shares of Berkshire. Insurance premiums earned, for example, rose to $12.72 billion in the quarter from $9.27 billion in the year-ago quarter. “The things they don’t control like when they take gains worked against them,” Smead said. “The things they do control, like insurance premiums, exploded.” Buffett, the world’s third richest person according to Forbes magazine, has run Berkshire since 1965. He favors acquiring and investing in easy-to-understand businesses that have consistent earnings power and stable management.  In October, Berkshire agreed to buy Van Tuyl Group, the largest privately held U.S. auto dealership group. Analysts said the purchase could help Berkshire grow in related businesses, including insurer Geico. In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares rose 0.1 percent to a record close of $214,970. Its Class B shares ended the day up 0.2 percent at $143.61, also a record close.

723,BRKa,Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway buys P&G;'s Duracell,"(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc has agreed to acquire Procter & Gamble Co’s Duracell battery unit in a complex transaction that lets Berkshire Chairman Warren Buffett buy a business he has supported for two decades and shave his company’s tax bill. Rather than pay cash, Berkshire (BRKa.N) will give P&G; $4.7 billion of the shares it now owns in the world’s largest consumer products company. P&G; (PG.N) will infuse $1.8 billion in cash into Duracell before the expected closing in the second half of 2015. The transaction announced on Thursday helps P&G; Chief Executive A.G. Lafley streamline his Cincinnati-based company by shedding slow-growing brands and focus on about 80 brands that generate most of its profit and revenue. P&G;’s better-known products include Tide laundry detergent and Pampers diapers. Buffett, meanwhile, avoids a big tax bill that Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire might have incurred if it sold its P&G; shares. Both P&G; and Berkshire shares hit a record high this week. Buying Duracell is a “brilliant move,” said Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management in Palm Beach, Florida, and is a longtime Berkshire critic who is selling its shares short. “Warren loves mature and durable consumer brands that produce predictable cash flow. Duracell fits the bill,” Kass added. “And accomplishing this in a tax-efficient transaction.” Berkshire has said it paid just $336 million for its 1.9 percent stake in P&G;, equal to 52.8 million shares on June 30. Assuming a 35 percent tax rate on corporate capital gains, the swap could save Berkshire more than $1 billion, on top of tax savings from two similar transactions earlier this year. Berkshire’s income tax bill was $8.95 billion in 2013, or 31 percent of pretax earnings. Duracell, whose batteries are known for their copper-colored tops, gives Buffett a familiar name to add to Berkshire’s stable of more than 80 businesses, including Benjamin Moore paint, the Dairy Queen ice cream chain and Heinz ketchup. “I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G; and Gillette,” Buffett said in a statement. [ID:nBw5J6R8za] Some analysts questioned why Berkshire views Duracell as a good fit, while P&G; does not. While Duracell has more than one-fourth of the global market for batteries, demand has slackened amid the growth in smartphones and other devices that rely on rechargeable power sources. “It is a good thing that P&G; is moving swiftly to divest its non-core brands,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said. “I don’t take it as a good sign that Buffett would rather own Duracell than P&G.;” Buffett’s assistant did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. In afternoon trading, Berkshire’s Class A shares were up 0.4 percent at $218,912, while P&G; fell 0.7 percent to $88.87. Berkshire has owned P&G; stock since P&G; bought Gillette Co in 2005. Buffett had invested in Gillette since 1989. Buffett was about halfway through a 14-year stint on Gillette’s board when that company agreed to buy Duracell for $7 billion in stock in 1996. That’s more than twice what Berkshire is paying, after accounting for the cash infusion. Buffett prefers owning businesses, especially if they are easy to understand and have strong competitive advantages, to the underlying stock. Earlier this year, Buffett swapped stock of Phillips 66 (PSX.N) for a unit that makes chemicals for pipelines, and stock of Graham Holdings Co (GHC.N), which once published the Washington Post, for a Miami TV station and other assets. Buffett has plenty of ammunition to buy more businesses:  Berkshire had $62.38 billion in cash as of Sept. 30. P&G; will take a noncash charge of 28 cents per share to write down goodwill and intangible assets, and adjust fiscal 2014 results to reflect Duracell as a discontinued operation. Shares of Energizer Holdings Inc (ENR.N), Duracell’s main rival, rose as much as 4.7 percent to a record high before easing to $128.43, up 2.6 percent. UBS household products analyst Stephen Powers said private equity investors might look for value in Energizer, given how Buffett proved “willing and eager” to buy Duracell.

724,BRKa,"For billionaire Warren Buffett, P&G;'s tide has crested","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co., one of Warren Buffett’s top portfolio holdings, is about to lose the billionaire’s influential backing at a time when it appears the company’s own fortunes have peaked. Thursday’s agreement by Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to turn over the $4.7 billion in shares it owns in the world’s largest consumer products company in exchange for P&G;’s Duracell battery business comes one day after P&G; shares hit a life-time high. “He is basically cashing in at a 52-week high,” said Doug Kass, who runs hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management in Palm Beach, Florida. “He is stating in transaction that Duracell is inexpensive and P&G; stock is expensive. And accomplishing this all in tax-efficient transaction.”  Buffett’s transaction provides an exit from an investment he began making a quarter century ago, and on which he had already been dialing back. Under the deal, P&G; will infuse about $1.8 billion of cash into Duracell before the expected closing in the second half of 2015. Berkshire became one of P&G;’s biggest shareholders as a result of Buffett’s investment in Gillette Co. P&G; bought Gillette in 2005 in a $57 billion deal that Buffett supported. Berkshire held more than 101 million P&G; shares in 2007 and cut the stake several times since then as the consumer-goods company faltered under previous Chief Executive Officer Bob McDonald. Berkshire had fewer than 53 million shares as of June 30. Although P&G; shares hit a life-time high of $89.88 on Wednesday, they have underperformed the market. Since its market bottom in March 2009, P&G; has doubled in price. That pales next to the 147 percent gain in P&G;’s peer sector, the S&P; consumer staples index, and the tripling in value of the wider S&P; 500.  And P&G; shares are expensive. They are trading at roughly 20 times forward earnings compared with a peer median of 18.7 times, and 16.5 times cash flow versus a peer median of 14.2. That means P&G; is more expensive than half its peers in arguably one of the market’s priciest sectors. The forward price-to-earnings multiple for the entire S&P; 500 is about 16, according to Thomson Reuters data. To be sure, P&G;’s 3.7 price-to-book ratio is cheap relative to the 5.3 median for its peers. Buffett favors measuring Berkshire’s own worth using growth in book value per share, instead of the stock price. In recent years, Berkshire has shed most of its multi-billion-dollar stakes in oil company ConocoPhillips and Kraft Foods Inc, the latter of which has since split into two companies.

727,BRKa,UPDATE 5-Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway buys P&G;'s Duracell,"* Buffett to return $4.7 billion worth of shares to P&G; * Purchase is “brilliant move” for Buffett - money manager   (Adds link to Breakingviews column) By Jonathan Stempel and Devika  Krishna Kumar Nov 13 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc has agreed to acquire Procter & Gamble Co’s Duracell battery unit in a complex transaction that lets Berkshire Chairman Warren Buffett buy a business he has supported for two decades and shave his company’s tax bill. Rather than pay cash, Berkshire will give P&G; $4.7 billion of the shares it now owns in the world’s largest consumer products company. P&G; will infuse $1.8 billion in cash into Duracell before the expected closing in the second half of 2015. The transaction announced on Thursday helps P&G; Chief Executive A.G. Lafley streamline his Cincinnati-based company by shedding slow-growing brands and focus on about 80 brands that generate most of its profit and revenue. P&G;’s better-known products include Tide laundry detergent and Pampers diapers. Buffett, meanwhile, avoids a big tax bill that Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire might have incurred if it sold its P&G; shares. Both P&G; and Berkshire shares hit a record high this week. Buying Duracell is a “brilliant move,” said Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management in Palm Beach, Florida, and is a longtime Berkshire critic who is selling its shares short. “Warren loves mature and durable consumer brands that produce predictable cash flow. Duracell fits the bill,” Kass added. “And accomplishing this in a tax-efficient transaction.” Berkshire has said it paid just $336 million for its 1.9 percent stake in P&G;, equal to 52.8 million shares on June 30. Assuming a 35 percent tax rate on corporate capital gains, the swap could save Berkshire more than $1 billion, on top of tax savings from two similar transactions earlier this year. Berkshire’s income tax bill was $8.95 billion in 2013, or 31 percent of pretax earnings. Duracell, whose batteries are known for their copper-colored tops, gives Buffett a familiar name to add to Berkshire’s stable of more than 80 businesses, including Benjamin Moore paint, the Dairy Queen ice cream chain and Heinz ketchup. “I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G; and Gillette,” Buffett said in a statement. Some analysts questioned why Berkshire views Duracell as a good fit, while P&G; does not. While Duracell has more than one-fourth of the global market for batteries, demand has slackened amid the growth in smartphones and other devices that rely on rechargeable power sources. “It is a good thing that P&G; is moving swiftly to divest its non-core brands,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said. “I don’t take it as a good sign that Buffett would rather own Duracell than P&G.;” Buffett’s assistant did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. In afternoon trading, Berkshire’s Class A shares were up 0.4 percent at $218,912, while P&G; fell 0.7 percent to $88.87. Berkshire has owned P&G; stock since P&G; bought Gillette Co in 2005. Buffett had invested in Gillette since 1989. Buffett was about halfway through a 14-year stint on Gillette’s board when that company agreed to buy Duracell for $7 billion in stock in 1996. That’s more than twice what Berkshire is paying, after accounting for the cash infusion. Buffett prefers owning businesses, especially if they are easy to understand and have strong competitive advantages, to the underlying stock. Earlier this year, Buffett swapped stock of Phillips 66  for a unit that makes chemicals for pipelines, and stock of Graham Holdings Co, which once published the Washington Post, for a Miami TV station and other assets. Buffett has plenty of ammunition to buy more businesses:  Berkshire had $62.38 billion in cash as of Sept. 30. P&G; will take a noncash charge of 28 cents per share to write down goodwill and intangible assets, and adjust fiscal 2014 results to reflect Duracell as a discontinued operation. Shares of Energizer Holdings Inc, Duracell’s main rival, rose as much as 4.7 percent to a record high before easing to $128.43, up 2.6 percent. UBS household products analyst Stephen Powers said private equity investors might look for value in Energizer, given how Buffett proved “willing and eager” to buy Duracell.

735,BRKa,US Ex-Im acknowledges errors in politically sensitive small biz data,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - (Refiles Nov. 13 story to fix spelling of Buffett throughout) WASHINGTON (Reuters): The U.S. Export-Import Bank has mischaracterized potentially hundreds of large companies and units of multinational conglomerates as small businesses, a flaw in its record keeping that could undermine the export lender’s survival strategy.  A Reuters analysis showed companies owned by billionaires like Warren Buffett and Mexico’s Carlos Slim, as well by Japanese and European conglomerates, were listed as small businesses and Ex-Im acknowledged errors in its data in response to those findings. Bank officials and supporters have used Ex-Im’s support for American small business as the first line of defense against conservatives’ campaign to shut it down as an exponent of “crony capitalism.”  The bank just won a nine month extension of its mandate in September and faces a bruising battle over the next seven months to secure its future.   A comparison of some 6,000 businesses characterized by Ex-Im as “small” with information supplied by corporate data collector Dun & Bradstreet, which Ex-Im also uses to vet applicants, and other sources turns up some 200 companies that appear to be mislabeled and many more whose classification is uncertain. A division of Austria’s Swarovski jewelers shows up, as does North Carolina’s Global Nuclear Fuels owned by General Electric (GE.N) and Japan’s Toshiba (6502.T) and Hitachi (6501.T).  The extent of the errors, which also mean some genuine small business transactions are not labeled as such, is not clear. Separate Ex-Im databases don’t even agree with each other. Responding to a list of 10 examples provided by Reuters, Ex-Im acknowledged errors in most of them, but argued their impact was small and that the mislabeling of small firms as large ones may have a greater bigger effect on the total tally of small business support. A spokesman said the bank aimed to be as transparent as possible. “When it comes to our data, we strive for 100 percent accuracy, and anything less is unacceptable, which is why we are constantly improving our systems,” he said, pointing to Ex-Im’s recent hiring of a chief information officer, an overhaul of databases and a review of paper documents. In an emailed response to Reuters, the bank cited five examples in which small firms were labeled as large firms by mistake.  The errors make it difficult to identify exactly how much Ex-Im support goes to big business like Caterpillar (CAT.N) and how much to small firms.   The problem is primarily political, as there are no legal implications of businesses being misclassified by Ex-Im, since it does not set money aside specifically for firms that meet industry-specific revenue and employee limits set by the Small Business Administration. The SBA guidelines exclude firms that may be small but are owned by deep-pocketed conglomerates.  Reuters calculations show that as much as $3 billion in authorizations listed as those for small business may have been misclassified over eight years - roughly 8 percent of Ex-Im’s $38 billion in small business support over that period. Total authorizations were worth $189 billion.    For example, among “small business” beneficiaries is Texas-based Condumex Inc. the U.S. sales operation for Mexico’s Grupo Condumex, a subsidiary of Slim’s Grupo Carso (GCARSOA1.MX). Or take Brock Grain Systems, a division of CTB International Corp., which has been owned by Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) since 2002.  In its battle to survive, Ex-Im has presented its statistics with exacting precision. Ex-Im says that in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, it engaged in 3,347 transactions supporting small businesses, accounting for almost a quarter of financial authorizations and nearly 40 percent of the exports the agency supported.  The lender authorized $20.5 billion during that fiscal year in low interest loans and other support for U.S. exporters and buyers of “Made in America” products. The mislabeling of transactions, however, makes it difficult to tell exactly how the pie is divided. It extends to a Web site that allows lawmakers and others to check how Ex-Im supports businesses in each Congressional district. The list of small businesses in Texas, for example, includes engineering giant Bechtel, which has 53,000 employees.

But good news is emerging now for those who prefer safer strategies: some of the best returns this year have come from stable stocks like billionaire Warren Buffett’s holding company Berkshire Hathaway or Swiss toilet maker Geberit . A basket of the two least volatile stocks in each STOXX Europe 600 sector index, as compiled by Thomson Reuters, up 8 percent year to date, or almost twice as much as the STOXX Europe 600 overall. (Here volatility is defined by the size of price moves in either direction.) Though that high performance might seem odd - particularly looking at double-digit returns yielded by other European stocks that see-sawed at the prospect of a U.S. interest rate hike recently - in fact it demonstrates that low-volatility stocks are often stronger companies with healthier earnings power. That distinction really matters when European companies’ earnings recovery is still vulnerable - and it’s one that more people are waking up to. “Investors are ready to invest on the equity market but under the condition that they are not too exposed to risk and that’s one argument for investing in the least volatile stocks,” said Laurent Lagarde, head of quant equity management at investment firm THEAM, a unit of BNP Paribas. The Reuters basket included traditionally defensive stocks like drugmaker Novartis, up 29 percent, but also benefited from similar gains by cyclical companies - those whose profits and share prices track the pace of the economy. Among those were Givaudan, the world’s biggest maker of flavours and fragrances, or media group Reed Elsevier. Stocks from Switzerland - home to reliable earners such as Geberit - accounted for 13 out of 38 components. The strategy also worked globally: BNP Paribas’ World Low volatility strategy returned 15 percent in the first 10 months of the year, helped by a rally of nearly 20 percent in the shares of Berkshire Hathaway, among others. A Lipper basket of 53 exchange traded funds which tracked stocks with low volatility returned 8 percent year to date. That compares to a 6 percent return for the MSCI World Index, Datastream data showed. And the trend continues to pick up steam. As last month’s volatility gripped financial markets, assets under management at low volatility stock funds attracted net inflows of over $1 billion even as other stock funds lost money, Markit data shows. This reflects investors’ weariness with jumpy markets. After a rollercoaster October more jitters are expected as the United States shuts off the flow of cheap money that has been buoying its banks and businesses, and economies from the euro zone to China struggle to grow. Fund manager Ossiam’s head of business development Isabelle Bourcier said interest in its low volatility ETFs had grown. “Expectations from clients that there will be volatility is helping us,” she said. Assets in low volatility ETFs have grown to $16 billion currently from $15 million when the financial crisis hit in 2008, Markit data showed.

Weatherford said the sale of its engineered chemistry and integrity drilling fluids businesses also included a potential increase of $75 million tied to the performance of the units after the closure of the deal, expected by the end of this month. Engineered chemistry supplies additives and fluids for a range of oilfield activities, including cementing, drilling and fracking. The other unit makes drilling fluids and additives for enhanced performance of drilling operations. The sale is part of Weatherford’s broader plan to divest non-core businesses and repay debt. The company has raised about $1.8 billion from divestitures this year. Weatherford said its net debt would be between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion at year-end, lower than its earlier target of $7.0 billion-$7.5 billion. “Positive that despite energy market turmoil Weatherford (is) still delivering on its strategy to jettison non-core businesses,” Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co analysts wrote in a note. In a separate statement, Lubrizol said the purchase of the two businesses would give it “a more significant footprint in the $20 billion oilfield chemicals business.”     (Reporting by Swetha Gopinath in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)",12012014,http://www.reuters.com/article/weatherford-assetsale-berkshire/update-1-weatherford-sells-chemicals-drilling-fluids-units-to-lubrizol-idUSL3N0TL45U20141201

The NetJets Association of Shared Aircraft Pilots accused NetJets of impersonating a pilot on Twitter, baiting pilots to conduct work slowdowns, even as the company threatened to fire pilots who did. It also accused NetJets of publishing photos of pilots engaged in lawful picketing. NetJets was also accused of illegally infiltrating a password-protected, confidential message board for pilots.

745,BRKa,UPDATE 2-Jefferies in talks to sell futures business,"(Adds background) Dec 16 (Reuters) - Investment bank Jefferies Group LLC, owned by Leucadia National Corp, said it was in talks to sell its commodities and financial derivatives brokerage, which has been struggling with high costs and falling fees. Jefferies, which also reported a fourth-quarter loss, is the latest bank to retreat from the commodities futures market as stricter regulation increases costs and intense competition and a decline in fees squeeze profit margins. Brokers, which make money clearing and executing trades for clients ranging from commercial hedgers to hedge funds, have also been hit by the rise of electronic trading, which allows customers to execute trades on their own screens. Jefferies’ move reverses a push into commodities that started with its $430 million purchase of the more than 130-year old business, formerly known as Prudential Bache, in 2011. “As a result of the growth and margin challenges we have recently faced in the Bache business ... we are pursuing strategic alternatives for this business,” Jefferies Chief Executive Richard Handler said in a statement on Tuesday. Commodities trading has become tougher this year as the market has fallen out of favor with investors who have been betting on strong growth from China for raw materials such as copper and crude oil. Newedge, one of the world’s top commodities brokerages, cut jobs in its London, New York and Chicago financial derivatives teams last week. ICAP, another commodities brokerage, is exiting base metals broking business at the end of the year. Jefferies’ investment banking revenue fell 24 percent to $316 million the fourth quarter ended Nov. 30 due to lackluster fixed income trading in a tepid trading environment. Revenue in its fixed income business dropped 73 percent to $61 million. Net loss attributable to the company was $92.4 million for the quarter, compared with a profit of $109.9 million a year earlier, the company said on Tuesday. Jefferies wrote down $52 million in goodwill and $8 million of the intangible assets that were allocated to the Bache business when the company was bought by Leucadia in 2013. Leucadia, which models itself on Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, bought Jefferies for $2.76 billion in stock. Excluding Bache, Jefferies’ would have posted an adjusted net profit of $19 million. Net revenue fell about 43 percent to $537.6 million. Jefferies, the first of the investment banks to report quarterly results, is often viewed as an indicator of the performance of other Wall Street banks. Leucadia’s shares were down 0.8 percent at $21.40 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

746,BRKa,Fitch Rates Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corp. Senior Debt Issue 'A+',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned 'A+' ratings to the $1  billion senior unsecured notes issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corp. (BHFC)  and fully guaranteed by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK). The 'A+' ratings are  equivalent to Fitch's ratings on both BRK's and BHFC's outstanding senior  unsecured notes.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's ratings on BRK are supported by the extremely strong capitalization and  market position of its insurance subsidiaries, solid operating performance with  good diversification across business lines and excellent financial flexibility  and liquidity. Also considered in the ratings are material equity market risk, insured natural  catastrophe exposures, growing exposure to asbestos and environmental risk and  various issues associated with the company's acquisition strategy. BHFC's issuance consists of $400 million floating-rate (LIBOR plus 17 basis  points) senior unsecured notes maturing Jan. 13, 2017 and $600 million  floating-rate (LIBOR plus 30 basis points) senior unsecured notes maturing Jan.  12, 2018. Proceeds from the issuance will fund $1 billion of maturing notes, and  consequently, there will be no change in financial leverage. BRK's consolidated financial leverage ratio was 24% as of Sept. 30, 2014,  excluding after-tax unrealized bond gains from stockholders' equity.  Consolidated interest coverage for the first three quarters of 2014 was 8.6X  excluding realized investment gains.  BRK's financial leverage ratio at the holding company level (including debt  issued by the company's finance company subsidiaries and guaranteed by BRK) was  14% at Sept. 30, 2014. The agency views BRK's ability to fund finance operations  at a low cost as an important competitive advantage for the finance operations  and also notes that much of the finance company debt is guaranteed by BRK. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to a future downgrade include: --Deterioration in the credit quality of key insurance subsidiaries (National  Indemnity, GenRe, and GEICO) that is no longer consistent with the current 'AA+'  rating. Measures of credit quality include Fitch's judgment of capitalization, a  total financing and commitments ratio greater than 1.5X, net leverage (excluding  affiliated investments) over 3.5X or a sharp and persistent reduction in  underwriting profits.  --A consolidated run-rate financial leverage ratio that exceeds 30% or a  run-rate financial leverage ratio from the holding company, insurance and  finance operations (including debt issued or guaranteed by the holding company)  that exceeds 25%. --Material increases in leveraged equity market exposure such as its equity  index put derivative portfolio.  --Acquisitions or other actions that reduce outstanding cash below $10 billion  or approximately 5X consolidated interest expense. Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: --A commitment to lower debt-to-tangible capital ratios attributed to the  holding company, insurance and finance operations. Fitch believes that this  would likely require the scaling back of the finance operations.

747,BRKa,Berkshire's NetJets defeats $500 million IRS tax claim,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - NetJets Inc, the private jet-sharing company owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc , has defeated a U.S. Internal Revenue Service lawsuit attempting to recoup more than $500 million of unpaid taxes, penalties and interest. U.S. District Judge Edmund Sargus in Columbus, Ohio, said on Monday that the IRS was bound by guidance it gave a NetJets predecessor in 1992 over when to collect federal transportation excise taxes, and could not impose more taxes retroactively. The judge’s 37-page decision was not a complete victory for NetJets. Sargus rejected a claim by the company that it deserved a $219.5 million refund plus interest on taxes already paid because its services were not “taxable transportation.” NetJets specializes in “fractional” aircraft ownership, which lets individuals and companies buy shares of private jets. Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire bought the company in 1998. The dispute arose from a series of IRS and federal court decisions over nearly two decades, on when and how Columbus-based NetJets should pay federal excise taxes. NetJets had been collecting and remitting these taxes on “occupied hourly” fees it charges customers. These are per-hour flight fees plus aircraft operating costs, including fuel. But the IRS later said taxes should also have been collected on monthly management fees, which include aircraft ownership costs such as crew salaries and insurance, and “variable” surcharges imposed when fuel prices rise higher than expected. In his decision, Sargus said NetJets should not be penalized now for having relied “in good faith” on the IRS’ 1992 guidance. “No doubt the IRS may retroactively change an earlier interpretation of law, even when a taxpayer relied on that earlier interpretation to his detriment,” Sargus wrote. “But courts repeatedly have held that the IRS must follow its own procedural rules in doing so. And, the IRS did not.” An IRS spokesman had no immediate comment on Tuesday. In a statement, NetJets said it was pleased with the decision on the $500 million IRS claim, and would review whether to appeal the portion concerning the tax refund. Buffett is the world’s third-richest person, according to Forbes magazine. He has said he has flown on NetJets flights hundreds of times. The case is NetJets Large Aircraft Inc. v.

U.S. District Judge Edmund Sargus in Columbus, Ohio, said on Monday that the IRS was bound by guidance it gave a NetJets predecessor in 1992 over when to collect federal transportation excise taxes, and could not impose more taxes retroactively. The judge’s 37-page decision was not a complete victory for NetJets. Sargus rejected a claim by the company that it deserved a $219.5 million refund plus interest on taxes already paid because its services were not “taxable transportation.” NetJets specializes in “fractional” aircraft ownership, which lets individuals and companies buy shares of private jets. Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire bought the company in 1998.  The dispute arose from a series of IRS and federal court decisions over nearly two decades, on when and how Columbus-based NetJets should pay federal excise taxes. NetJets had been collecting and remitting these taxes on “occupied hourly” fees it charges customers. These are per-hour flight fees plus aircraft operating costs, including fuel. But the IRS later said taxes should also have been collected on monthly management fees, which include aircraft ownership costs such as crew salaries and insurance, and “variable” surcharges imposed when fuel prices rise higher than expected. In his decision, Sargus said NetJets should not be penalized now for having relied “in good faith” on the IRS’ 1992 guidance. “No doubt the IRS may retroactively change an earlier interpretation of law, even when a taxpayer relied on that earlier interpretation to his detriment,” Sargus wrote. “But courts repeatedly have held that the IRS must follow its own procedural rules in doing so. And, the IRS did not.” An IRS spokesman had no immediate comment on Tuesday. In a statement, NetJets said it was pleased with the decision on the $500 million IRS claim, and would review whether to appeal the portion concerning the tax refund. Buffett is the world’s third-richest person, according to Forbes magazine. He has said he has flown on NetJets flights hundreds of times. The case is NetJets Large Aircraft Inc. v.

The changes were among several that Berkshire made in its common stock investments in the fourth quarter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing detailing the conglomerate’s domestic equity investments as of Dec. 31. Berkshire began accumulating the bulk of its 17.1 million-share stake in Deere, worth $1.51 billion at year end, in the third quarter of 2014, but had not previously disclosed it. The SEC often lets Buffett quietly accumulate large stakes to deter copycats. Deere shares rose 1.2 percent in after-market trading. Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire reveals new investments because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett and try to copy him. Deere declined to comment. Berkshire’s decision to dispose of its entire 41 million-share stake in Exxon Mobil was unusual for Berkshire because the stake had been recently acquired, dating only to 2013. Exxon shares have outperformed many peers in recent months, losing only about 15 percent of their value from June through January as oil prices slumped by more than half. It is unclear why Buffett appeared to have soured on Exxon, or whether Berkshire made money on the investment. Buffett “is of course a value investor, and the fact of the matter is that Exxon shares held up extremely well during the oil price meltdown,” said Raymond James energy analyst Pavel Molchanov in an interview. Exxon Mobil declined to comment. Berkshire also reported a new stake of 4.7 million shares in Rupert Murdoch’s media company Twenty-First Century Fox Inc . It further reported a new 8.4 million-share stake in Restaurant Brands International Inc , the parent of the Burger King and Tim Hortons restaurant chains. Berkshire helped finance Burger King’s purchase of Tim Hortons last year and got Restaurant Brands shares through the merger. Berkshire also added to holdings in IBM Corp, General Motors Co, Phillips 66, Suncor Energy Inc  and DirecTV, among others, and shed stakes in oil company ConocoPhillips and pharmacy benefits management company Express Scripts Holding Co. U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter. Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, owns more than 80 businesses ranging from Dairy Queen ice cream to Geico insurance to the BNSF railroad.

762,BRKa,Berkshire to buy German motorcycle equipment retailer,"NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc said on Friday it had agreed to buy German motorcycle apparel and accessories retailer Detlev Louis Motorrad-Vertriebs GmbH for a little more than 400 million euros ($456 million). The purchase enables Buffett, known for his optimism about the United States and the investment opportunities it offers, to expand in Europe despite its economic problems. Ute Louis, the widow of company founder Detlev Louis, had approached Berkshire about a possible transaction and sold the Hamburg-based company to a Berkshire unit, according to the law firm Beiten Burkhardt, which advised on the purchase. Antitrust approval is required, the law firm said. Buffett’s assistant, Debbie Bosanek, confirmed the purchase price, which was earlier reported by the Financial Times. Buffett told that newspaper that the purchase was a “door opener,” and that “the U.S. is my first love, but I see terrific possibilities for us in Europe.” Most of Berkshire’s more than 80 business units operate mainly in the United States, though the Omaha, Nebraska-based company has invested in European companies such as German reinsurer Munich Re and French drugmaker Sanofi SA. Detlev Louis has annual sales of 270 million euros ($308 million), employs more than 1,500 people, has more than 70 outlets in Germany and Austria, and serves 25 countries through online stores, its law firm said. The purchase fits Buffett’s common practice of buying entire businesses and then leaving existing management in place. Buffett has done this outside the United States. In 2006, Berkshire paid $4 billion for most of Israel’s IMC International Metalworking Cos. He paid $2.05 billion for the rest in 2013.  The Detlev Louis purchase also expands Berkshire’s presence in transportation-related industries. Berkshire owns the Geico auto insurance business and agreed in October to buy the large U.S. auto retailer Van Tuyl Group. Buffett is also no stranger to motorcycles. In 2009, Berkshire bought $300 million of debt with a 15 percent interest rate from Harley Davidson Inc. Still, Detlev Louis remains a small acquisition for Berkshire, whose $62.38 billion cash hoard at the end of September 2014 left Buffett with the power to make one or more large acquisitions, which he calls “elephants.” Buffett told the Financial Times that Europe was fertile ground for such purchases despite its problems.

765,BRKa,"Buffett, a cheerleader for America, takes his checkbook abroad","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, in his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders last year, called America “the mother lode of opportunity.”  This year, his 50th at Berkshire’s helm, the world’s third-richest person could write something quite different. When Buffett releases this year’s letter on Saturday, he may point to opportunities outside of the United States, after he recently decided to buy a German motorcycle accessories retailer and said he may shop more in that country.  That would mark a significant turn for Berkshire, a conglomerate with more than 80 businesses, giant stock investments and a $360 billion market value. Buffett did not return a request for comment. In his letter, eagerly awaited on Wall Street for Buffett’s candid thoughts on investing, business and life, the 84-year-old Buffett may detail his vision for Berkshire in the decades to come, including after he is gone. His comparatively taciturn second-in-command, 91-year-old Charlie Munger, is also expected to express his thoughts. “Warren Buffett recognizes that global investing is going to be an important part of the future,” said Michael Yoshikami,  chief executive of Destination Wealth Management in Walnut Creek, California and a longtime Berkshire shareholder. Buffett’s strategy of buying solid companies at low prices has gotten more difficult in the United States. In the first quarter of 2009, when the S&P; 500 index was barely one-third of what it is now, stocks on average cost 12.9 times projected full-year earnings.  At the end of 2014, that multiple had reached 17.4, above the long-term average of 14.8 times earnings, meaning it costs more to get the same financial pop. By contrast, the rest of the world’s growth has been sluggish. Germany is expected to grow just 1.3 percent this year, while the U.S. economy may expand 3.6 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund. Though Buffett said this week the falling euro was not his primary driver for buying in Europe, it was a factor. The currency has slid about 20 percent against the U.S. dollar since May.  In the last year, Berkshire has announced several purchases worth or estimated at a couple of billion dollars each. These have included Procter & Gamble Co’s Duracell battery unit, the Van Tuyl auto retailer, and SNC-Lavalin Group Inc’s AltaLink energy transmission unit in Canada. Buffett also kicked in $3 billion toward Burger King’s purchase of Canadian doughnut chain Tim Hortons, which created Restaurant Brands International Inc. Burger King is run by Brazil’s 3G Capital, which shares ownership with Berkshire of ketchup maker HJ Heinz Co. Berkshire ended September with $62 billion in cash, well above the $20 billion cash cushion Buffett likes. That leaves more than $40 billion to go shopping. That means Buffett needs big purchases, which he calls “elephants,” to soak up significant amounts of money. He has said he would team up again with a partner such as 3G Capital. “There may be opportunities overseas that he would certainly consider,” said Cathy Seifert, an analyst with S&P; Capital IQ. But even if Berkshire spreads its wings geographically, Seifert said, it will not turn its back on a good U.S. purchase. “I definitely would not rule out the U.S.,” she said.

766,BRKa,"Buffett looks to succession, signals future growth problem","NEW YORK (Reuters) - In his 50 years at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Warren Buffett has transformed a failing textile company into a sprawling conglomerate that has vastly outperformed most of the rest of corporate America.    But he now says: Do not expect a repeat of that outperformance in the next 50.    In the 84-year-old’s annual shareholder letter released on Saturday, Buffett said Berkshire has grown so large - 751,000 times its original net worth per share - that the future pace of gains “will not come close” to those of the past. “The numbers have become too big,” Buffett wrote. “I think Berkshire will outperform the average American company, but our advantage, if any, won’t be great.”     Within 10 to 20 years, Buffett said, Berkshire’s girth could require whoever then runs the Omaha, Nebraska-based company to consider steps he has resisted, such as paying dividends or conducting “massive” share repurchases. Buffett, also addressing one of the more pressing topics at Berkshire, said he and his board of directors “believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO,” likely for a decade or more, and who in some respects “will do a better job than I am doing.” While Buffett did not name that person, Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 91, said Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, two top Buffett lieutenants, would be prime candidates. Abel, 52, runs Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Jain, 63, has been Buffett’s top insurance executive for three decades. A successor could also be female: Buffett said “gender should never decide who becomes CEO.” And Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who run some Berkshire investments, “can be of particular help to the CEO in evaluating acquisitions,” he added. “You’ve got such good candidates,” said Thomas Russo, a principal at Gardner, Russo & Gardner, which invests 12 percent of its $10 billion of assets in Berkshire. “I think they’ll adopt a different capital structure approach, which will include a healthy, healthy large dividend.” Buffett is preparing in May to celebrate 50 years of running Berkshire, whose market value is now $363 billion. On Saturday, Berkshire also reported a 17 percent drop in fourth-quarter profit, to $4.16 billion, or $2,529 per Class A share, from $4.99 billion, or $3,035, a year ago, as investment gains and results from insurance underwriting declined. Operating profit rose 5 percent to $3.96 billion, or $2,412 per share, from $3.78 billion, or $2,297. For all of 2014, profit rose 2 percent to $19.87 billion, while operating profit increased 9 percent to $16.55 billion. Revenue rose 7 percent $194.67 billion. Book value per share, which Buffett considers a good measure of Berkshire’s worth, rose 8.3 percent to $146,186 but lagged gains in the Standard & Poor’s 500 for the fifth time in six years. Despite the big numbers, Berkshire had some problems. Buffett lamented the performance of the BNSF railroad, saying it “disappointed many of its customers” with congestion on its rail lines caused by bad weather, amid rising oil shipments and a bumper grain harvest. He also said he was “embarrassed” by taking too long to exit a $2.3 billion investment in Tesco Plc, a British retailer that became mired in an accounting scandal. Berkshire lost $444 million on Tesco, but Buffett said that’s just 0.2 percent of its net worth. Berkshire owns more than 80 companies, such as Geico insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream, and $117.5 billion of equity investments in such companies as Wells Fargo & Co, Coca-Cola Co, American Express Co and IBM Corp. Buffett remains on the prowl for acquisitions, and with $63.27 billion of cash could make big purchases, which he calls “elephants,” while preserving a $20 billion cash cushion. Despite spending $7.8 billion on 31 acquisitions in 2014, Berkshire has not bought an elephant since paying $12.25 billion to buy half of ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co in 2013. And while Buffett has said he may shop more in Germany, after on Feb. 20 agreeing to buy a German motorcycle accessories retailer, Berkshire’s main focus will remain at home. “Though we will always invest abroad as well, the mother lode of opportunities runs through America,” he wrote.     Buffett’s letter retained the folksy tone that have helped make him popular among investors. Talking about his See’s Candies business, which requires little capital investment, Buffett compared the company’s profits to “rabbits breeding.” And Buffett said that at Berkshire’s annual meeting last year, part of a weekend he calls “Woodstock for Capitalists,” shareholders bought 10,000 bottles of Heinz ketchup with Buffett or Munger on the labels. (Buffett’s cost $2, Munger’s $1.50.) This year, Buffett said Heinz will also be selling mustard as well as ketchup. “Buy both!” he exhorted.

770,BRKa,Highlights: Warren Buffett's letter to investors,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett released his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) shareholders on Saturday, written with his usual mix of business facts, common-sense advice and showmanship. This year marks the 50th anniversary of Buffett’s time heading the sprawling conglomerate. On a potential successor: “Both the board and I believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO – a successor ready to assume the job the day after I die or step down. In certain important respects, this person will do a better job than I am doing.” On investing: “Periodically, financial markets will become divorced from reality – you can count on that. ...ever forget that 2+2 will always equal 4. And when someone tells you how old-fashioned that math is —- zip up your wallet, take a vacation and come back in a few years to buy stocks at cheap prices.” On oversight:  “We do, of course, have an active audit function; no sense being a dammed fool.” On lodging for the May 2 annual meeting in Omaha: “Airbnb is making a special effort to obtain listings for the period around meeting time and is likely to have a wide array of accommodations to offer. Airbnb’s services may be especially helpful to shareholders who expect to spend only a single night in Omaha and are aware that last year a few hotels required guests to pay for a minimum of three nights. That gets expensive. Those people on a tight budget should check the Airbnb website.” On the meeting as spectacle: “Get up early on Saturday morning. At 6:20 a.m., Norman and Jake, two Texas longhorns each weighing about a ton, will proceed down 10th Street to the CenturyLink. Aboard them will be a couple of our Justin Boot executives, who do double duty as cowboys. Following the steers will be four horses pulling a Wells Fargo stagecoach. Berkshire already markets planes, trains and automobiles. Adding steers and stagecoaches to our portfolio should seal our reputation as America’s all-purpose transportation company.” On the GEICO gecko: “The gecko, I should add, has one particularly endearing quality – he works without pay. Unlike a human spokesperson, he never gets a swelled head from his fame nor does he have an agent to constantly remind us how valuable he is. I love the little guy.” On improving BNSF railroad service: “Though weather, which was particularly severe last year, will always cause railroads a variety of operating problems, our responsibility is to do whatever it takes to restore our service to industry-leading levels. That can’t be done overnight: The extensive work required to increase system capacity sometimes disrupts operations while it is underway. Recently, however, our outsized expenditures are beginning to show results. During the last three months, BNSF’s performance metrics have materially improved from last year’s figures.” On the future of Berkshire: “All told, Berkshire is ideally positioned for life after Charlie (Munger) and I leave the scene.

771,BRKa,Warren Buffett says Berkshire has 'right person' as heir,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, the billionaire chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, told investors on Saturday that the company had found his successor, and the company’s vice chairman, Charlie Munger, identified two Berkshire executives as candidates.  In Berkshire’s annual report to shareholders, Greg Abel, the head of Berkshire’s energy companies, and Ajit Jain, a top insurance executive, were said by Munger to be “proven performers who would probably be under-described as ‘world-class.’” “‘World-leading’ would be the description I would choose,” Munger said in a letter to Berkshire shareholders. “In some important ways, each is a better business executive than Buffett.” Buffett’s son, Howard, would become non-executive chairman after the departure of his father, who is also Berkshire’s chairman.  In his previous letters to shareholders, the 84-year-old Buffett has said Berkshire board had been fully aware of his chosen successor but that he was keeping his options open. Investors have long speculated about who would, or could, succeed Buffett, particularly after he was diagnosed with, and then beat, prostate cancer in 2012.  Munger, whom Buffett describes as “my partner,” is 91. “Both the board and I believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO – a successor ready to assume the job the day after I die or step down,” Buffett said. “In certain important respects, this person will do a better job than I am doing,” Buffett added. Berkshire on Saturday also reported a 17 percent drop in fourth-quarter net income, but a 2 percent increase in full-year profit. Operating profit rose in both periods. Neither Buffett’s nor Munger’s letter on Saturday referred by name to Matthew Rose, executive chairman of the BNSF railroad unit, who has also been mentioned by investors as a possible successor. Buffett said BNSF is, by far, Berkshire’s most important non-insurance unit but “was not good in 2014, a year in which the railroad disappointed many of its customers” despite  capital outlays far exceeding those of Union Pacific Corp, its main rival. BUFFETT’S ABCs FOR NEW CEO Buffett strongly suggested in his letter that his potential successor already works within Berkshire and laid out the challenges facing his successor as Berkshire grows ever larger. He said Berkshire’s earnings and capital resources will eventually reach a level where management will not be able to intelligently reinvest all of the company’s earnings. “At that time our directors will need to determine whether the best method to distribute the excess earnings is through dividends, share repurchases or both,” Buffett said. Buffett said his successor will also need to avoid the “debilitating forces” that decades ago befell companies such as General Motors, IBM, Sears Roebuck and U.S. Steel.  “My successor will need one other particular strength: the ability to fight off the ABCs of business decay, which are arrogance, bureaucracy and complacency,” he said. “When these corporate cancers metastasize, even the strongest of companies can falter.” Buffett has run Berkshire since 1965, transforming it from a failing textile company into a conglomerate with a $363 billion market value and more than 80 operating businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, energy, food and apparel.  The Omaha, Nebraska-based company also has more than $117 billion of equity investments.  Age will also be a factor, and Buffett said Berkshire may be best off if his successor stays on for at least a decade. “Our directors also believe that an incoming CEO should be relatively young, so that he or she can have a long run in the job,” Buffett wrote. “It’s hard to teach a new dog old tricks. And they are not likely to retire at 65 either - or have you noticed?” Buffett also said Berkshire’s directors believe future CEOs should be internal candidates they know well. Abel, 52, leads Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and Jain, 63, has been Buffett’s top insurance deputy for three decades. In Saturday’s letter, Buffett said: “Ajit’s underwriting skills are unmatched. His mind, moreover, is an idea factory that is always looking for more lines of business he can add to his current assortment.” In last year’s letter, Buffett called Abel an “extraordinary manager.”  Bill Smead, who oversees $1.3 billion at Smead Capital Management in Seattle and invests $55 million in Berkshire, called Jain a “brilliant” insurance executive but said Abel could be a better fit as CEO. “I think you want someone who is good at overseeing numerous stand-alone companies,” he said. “That would be advantage Abel.” Because Berkshire Hathaway Energy is a “mini-conglomerate” itself, “you practice in the miniature and then ultimately that puts you in the position to be the one,” Smead said.

773,BRKa,"Buffett says 'sprawl' is good, but may not be good enough","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett wants to buy more businesses to add to Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s “sprawl,” but cautioned it may not keep the company he has run for 50 years from evolving into something rarely used to describe it up until now: average. In his annual letter to shareholders, Buffett on Saturday said Berkshire’s huge balance sheet gives him the power to funnel capital to some of the more than 80 operating units that deserve it, while its decentralized structure makes it the “home of choice” for many businesses looking to sell. “Berkshire is now a sprawling conglomerate, constantly trying to sprawl further,” Buffett wrote. “In an operating sense, Berkshire is not a giant company, but rather a collection of large companies.” That sprawl, including 9-1/2 businesses that would on their own make the Fortune 500 - Berkshire owns half of ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co for instance - may limit its power to outperform. Indeed, that power has been waning. Berkshire’s book value per share, Buffett’s favored growth measure, has after taxes risen less than the Standard & Poor’s 500 index including dividends, pre-tax, in five of the last six calendar years, after dwarfing the index in the prior 44 years.  Its stock price has also slightly lagged the index since the end of 2008, the company said. “The bad news is that Berkshire’s long-term gains - measured by percentages, not by dollars - cannot be dramatic and will not come close to those achieved in the past 50 years,” Buffett wrote. “The numbers have become too big. I think Berkshire will outperform the average American company, but our advantage, if any, won’t be great.” Buffett still wants Berkshire to make acquisitions in the $5 billion to $20 billion range. And purchases could be even bigger if he teams with partners, such as Brazil’s 3G Capital. That firm bought the rest of Heinz and got $3 billion from Berkshire to help its Burger King unit buy Canadian donut chain Tim Hortons, creating Restaurant Brands International Inc.  Buffett said he expects to work with 3G on more activities. He also questioned the wisdom of deferring too readily to investment bankers who advise what to buy and sell. “Investment bankers, being paid as they are for action, constantly urge acquirers to pay 20 percent to 50 percent premiums over market price for publicly-held businesses,” he wrote. “A few years later, bankers – bearing straight faces – again appear and just as earnestly urge spinning off the earlier acquisition in order to ‘unlock shareholder value,’” he added.     Still, Berkshire is sitting on $63.27 billion of cash and its most recent purchases have been comparatively small. They have included the AltaLink electric transmission unit in Canada, and Van Tuyl Automotive, the fifth-largest U.S. auto retailer. Berkshire also plans to acquire Procter & Gamble Co’s Duracell battery unit later this year. Once in Berkshire’s stable, those companies will likely stay. Though Buffett does shed or give up some businesses - the textile company that gave Berkshire its name was closed in 1985 - Buffett said spinoffs “make no sense,” citing tax reasons and a belief that businesses are worth more within Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire than on their own. Buffett said his eventual successor at Berkshire, whenever he or she takes the job - “gender should never decide” - will need to monitor those businesses closely, and as Berkshire grows larger fend off the “arrogance, bureaucracy and complacency” that can destroy seemingly indestructible companies. “For very good reasons, business owners and operating managers with values similar to ours will continue to be attracted to Berkshire as a one-of-a-kind and permanent home,” Buffett wrote, italicizing “permanent” for emphasis.

775,BRKa,HIGHLIGHTS-Warren Buffett's letter to investors,"NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett released his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders on Saturday, written with his usual mix of business facts, common-sense advice and showmanship. This year marks the 50th anniversary of Buffett’s time heading the sprawling conglomerate. On a potential successor: “Both the board and I believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO - a successor ready to assume the job the day after I die or step down. In certain important respects, this person will do a better job than I am doing.” On investing: “Periodically, financial markets will become divorced from reality - you can count on that. ... ever forget that 2+2 will always equal 4. And when someone tells you how old-fashioned that math is —- zip up your wallet, take a vacation and come back in a few years to buy stocks at cheap prices.” On oversight: “We do, of course, have an active audit function; no sense being a dammed fool.” On lodging for the May 2 annual meeting in Omaha: “Airbnb is making a special effort to obtain listings for the period around meeting time and is likely to have a wide array of accommodations to offer. Airbnb’s services may be especially helpful to shareholders who expect to spend only a single night in Omaha and are aware that last year a few hotels required guests to pay for a minimum of three nights. That gets expensive. Those people on a tight budget should check the Airbnb website.” On the meeting as spectacle: “Get up early on Saturday morning. At 6:20 a.m., Norman and Jake, two Texas longhorns each weighing about a ton, will proceed down 10th Street to the CenturyLink. Aboard them will be a couple of our Justin Boot executives, who do double duty as cowboys. Following the steers will be four horses pulling a Wells Fargo stagecoach. Berkshire already markets planes, trains and automobiles. Adding steers and stagecoaches to our portfolio should seal our reputation as America’s all-purpose transportation company.” On the GEICO gecko: “The gecko, I should add, has one particularly endearing quality - he works without pay. Unlike a human spokesperson, he never gets a swelled head from his fame nor does he have an agent to constantly remind us how valuable he is. I love the little guy.” On improving BNSF railroad service: “Though weather, which was particularly severe last year, will always cause railroads a variety of operating problems, our responsibility is to do whatever it takes to restore our service to industry-leading levels. That can’t be done overnight: The extensive work required to increase system capacity sometimes disrupts operations while it is underway. Recently, however, our outsized expenditures are beginning to show results. During the last three months, BNSF’s performance metrics have materially improved from last year’s figures.” On the future of Berkshire: “All told, Berkshire is ideally positioned for life after Charlie (Munger) and I leave the scene. We have the right people in place - the right directors, managers and prospective successors to those managers. Our culture, furthermore, is embedded throughout their ranks. Our system is also regenerative. To a large degree, both good and bad cultures self-select to perpetuate themselves. For very good reasons, business owners and operating managers with values similar to ours will continue to be attracted to Berkshire as a one-of-a-kind and permanent home.”   (Reporting by Luciana Lopez, Jonathan Stempel and Jennifer Ablan)",2282015,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-buffett-letter/highlights-warren-buffetts-letter-to-investors-idUSL1N0W20IO20150228
776,BRKa,Buffett questions putting activist on GM board,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Chief Executive Warren Buffett, one of the largest shareholders in General Motors Co (GM.N), said on Monday he would be wary of putting former U.S. autos task force member Harry Wilson or anyone else on the company’s board if the focus was on the short-term performance of the automaker. “I totally disagree with the idea of putting somebody on the board who has an option on some other people’s stock which is only good for two years,” Buffett said on CNBC. “It’s just not the way to run a business,” he added. In a statement to CNBC, Wilson said he is not a short-term strategist when it comes to General Motors, a company whose shares he has owned since 2011. Wilson said he agrees with Buffett in supporting Mary Barra as GM CEO. Wilson and a group of hedge funds that own almost 2 percent of GM stock are pressing the automaker to buy back $8 billion in stock over the 12 months following its June annual meeting, and agree to give Wilson a seat on its board. Buffett said he was concerned that Wilson’s compensation from the hedge funds would be linked to the performance of GM over only two years. But Wilson, in his statement to CNBC, said he is “perfectly willing to take all of my compensation in stock and have it locked up for an extended period of time. This is not by any means a two-year deal.” Berkshire Hathaway owned 2.55 percent of GM’s shares at the end of last year, according to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A GM spokesman declined to comment. Wilson, 43, was a member of the government-appointed task force that helped lead GM through bankruptcy reorganization in 2009. He could not immediately be reached for comment.     United Auto Workers President Dennis Williams, whose union indirectly controls the largest single block of GM shares, told Reuters last month that the Wilson group’s stock buy-back proposal may be premature. Williams has met with Wilson, but has not said whether he will back Wilson’s bid to join GM’s board. Buffett also told CNBC on Monday that companies in the auto industry can burn through cash quickly and he would not be bothered if GM Chief Executive Mary Barra decided the company should hold onto its $25.2 billion in cash.

777,BRKa,"IBM shareholder sues company, alleging it overvalued chip unit","NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM Corp was sued on Monday by a shareholder that said it committed securities fraud by failing to write down a money-losing semiconductor unit before agreeing to pay another company $1.5 billion to take that unit off its hands. The lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court arose from IBM’s announcement last Oct. 20 that it would sell the unit to GlobalFoundries Inc, and take a related $4.7 billion pre-tax charge. IBM also announced third-quarter results that day. Its share price fell 9 percent over the next two trading days, wiping out more than $18 billion of market value. The Armonk, New York-based company did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the suit. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc is among IBM’s largest shareholders. According to the complaint, IBM inflated its stock price before selling the semiconductor unit by carrying the unit’s property, plant and equipment assets on its books at $2.4 billion, when it should have known the assets were worthless. The complaint said potential bidders had been unwilling to pay much more than $1 billion for the entire unit, including intellectual property and personnel, suggesting that the hard assets had no or negative market value. The lawsuit by the City of Sterling Heights Police & Fire Retirement System in Michigan also named three IBM officials as defendants, including Chief Executive Virginia Rometty. It seeks class-action status on behalf of shareholders from April 17 to Oct. 17, 2014. “Defendants presented a misleading picture of IBM’s business and prospects,” the complaint said. “When the truth about the company was revealed to the market, the price of IBM common stock fell precipitously.” GlobalFoundries is an affiliate of Mubadala Development Co, an Abu Dhabi state investment fund.

780,BRKa,UPDATE 1-Buffett questions putting activist on GM board,"(Adds comments from Wilson) DETROIT, March 2 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Chief Executive Warren Buffett, one of the largest shareholders in General Motors Co, said on Monday he would be wary of putting former U.S. autos task force member Harry Wilson or anyone else on the company’s board if the focus was on the short-term performance of the automaker. “I totally disagree with the idea of putting somebody on the board who has an option on some other people’s stock which is only good for two years,” Buffett said on CNBC. “It’s just not the way to run a business,” he added. In a statement to CNBC, Wilson said he is not a short-term strategist when it comes to General Motors, a company whose shares he has owned since 2011. Wilson said he agrees with Buffett in supporting Mary Barra as GM CEO. Wilson and a group of hedge funds that own almost 2 percent of GM stock are pressing the automaker to buy back $8 billion in stock over the 12 months following its June annual meeting, and agree to give Wilson a seat on its board. Buffett said he was concerned that Wilson’s compensation from the hedge funds would be linked to the performance of GM over only two years. But Wilson, in his statement to CNBC, said he is “perfectly willing to take all of my compensation in stock and have it locked up for an extended period of time. This is not by any means a two-year deal.” Berkshire Hathaway owned 2.55 percent of GM’s shares at the end of last year, according to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A GM spokesman declined to comment. Wilson, 43, was a member of the government-appointed task force that helped lead GM through bankruptcy reorganization in 2009. He could not immediately be reached for comment. United Auto Workers President Dennis Williams, whose union indirectly controls the largest single block of GM shares, told Reuters last month that the Wilson group’s stock buy-back proposal may be premature. Williams has met with Wilson, but has not said whether he will back Wilson’s bid to join GM’s board. Buffett also told CNBC on Monday that companies in the auto industry can burn through cash quickly and he would not be bothered if GM Chief Executive Mary Barra decided the company should hold onto its $25.2 billion in cash.

U.S. consumer spending fell for a second month in  January, likely as lower gasoline prices continued to weigh on receipts at service stations, while personal income fell just short of expectations, showing a rise of 0.3 percent. “Basically mixed, income up and spending down, inflation basically not a problem but up from the last time,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. “Once the market digests this mixed bag of economic numbers, we will probably see the market attempt to move higher later in the session.” At 9:45 a.m. (1445 GMT), data will be released on the manufacturing sector by financial data firm Markit, following shortly afterwards by the Institute for Supply Management’s reading on the manufacturing sector at 10:00 a.m. (1500 GMT). S&P; 500 e-mini futures were down 1.75 points and fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract, indicated a flat open. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures rose 13 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures added 5.75 points. Major Wall Street indexes dipped on Friday, but the Dow Industrials and S&P; 500 still managed their biggest monthly gains since October 2011, while the Nasdaq notched its best month since January 2012. The Nasdaq is within striking distance of the 5,000 mark and record highs set in March 2000. Chip maker NXP Semiconductors NV has agreed to buy smaller peer Freescale Semiconductor Ltd and merge operations in a deal valuing the combined company at over $40 billion. NXP shares climbed 14.9 percent to $97.50 in premarket trade while Freescale advanced 9 percent to $39.35.

784,BRKa,"Buffett says 'no jockeying' between Jain, Abel for top post: CNBC","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, the billionaire chief executive officer and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), told CNBC on Monday that Berkshire executives Ajit Jain and Greg Abel were not angling for the top Berkshire job.    In Berkshire’s annual report to shareholders on Saturday, Vice Chairman Charlie Munger hinted that Jain, a top insurance executive, and Abel, the head of Berkshire’s energy companies, were top candidates to succeed Buffett. “There’s no jockeying position at all” between Jain and Abel, Buffett said on CNBC. Speculation has mounted among Berkshire investors over who will eventually succeed the 84-year-old Buffett.  The field was narrowed in the annual Berkshire letter, when Buffett said he and the board had found his successor, and Munger wrote that Abel and Jain were “proven performers who would probably be under-described as ‘world-class.’” “‘World-leading’ would be the description I would choose,” Munger said in a separate letter to shareholders, also on Saturday. “In some important ways, each is a better business executive than Buffett.” On Monday, Buffett said: “When Charlie’s letter came in and it referenced Greg and Ajit, it was news to me that he was writing that.” “He’s right. They’re very, very, very good, each one of them.” Munger, whom Buffett describes as “my partner,” is 91. Asked if Abel, 52, and Jain, 63, were aware of who the next successor would be, Buffett said: “No.” “We have a precise plan in mind, very detailed, as to what happens later today if I pass out on this show or something of the sort,” he said. “It’s all in place, and it wouldn’t take 24 hours to implement.”  Neither Buffett’s nor Munger’s letters referred by name to Matthew Rose, 55, executive chairman of the BNSF railroad unit, who has also been mentioned by investors as a possible successor. Buffett told CNBC that Rose was not out of the race for potential chief executive officer. In his letter on Saturday, Buffett said age would also be a factor and that Berkshire might be better off if his successor were to stay on for at least a decade. On investing, Buffett said Berkshire was continuing to stick with IBM shares, the Dow Jones industrial average’s worst performer in 2014, “because I like it.” As of Dec. 31, Berkshire held a 7.79 percent stake in IBM.  “There have been no surprises at IBM since we started buying it a few years ago,” Buffett said. “We expected revenue to come down. We expected a year like this where foreign exchange would take a whack off revenues.”  ",3022015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-buffett-cnbc/buffett-says-no-jockeying-between-jain-abel-for-top-post-cnbc-idUSKBN0LY1E120150302

789,BRKa,UPDATE 1-Berkshire Hathaway turns to Europe for dollar refinancing,"(Adds context) By Laura Benitez LONDON, March 5 (IFR) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is planning to raise its first ever issue in the European market, a triple-tranche euro benchmark that will refinance some of its dollar debt. The Aa2/AA rated conglomerate is taking advantage of a strong backdrop and record low yields in the single currency, becoming the latest in a string of US names to cross the pond in recent months. Lead managers are marketing an eight-year tranche at 35bp area over mid-swaps, a 12-year at 50bp area and a 20-year at 65bp area, implying respective yields of around 0.9%, 1.34% and 1.75%. Those yields are much lower than the 3.2% coupon on a US$1.7bn bond that matured on February 11 2015 which Berkshire is refinancing with this new issue. The company reported earnings in February, posting a fourth-quarter profit decline of 17% as investment gains declined, but operating results improved. A hedge fund manager said he expected the deal to go well and replicate the success of a 8.5bn transaction priced for Coca-Cola last week. “Berkshire is a well respected name and well rated,” he said. “Providing they don’t print too large a size it should have a good following. Saying that, many insurance companies perceive the issuer to be ‘insurance’, and may not participate as it would be effectively be financing a competitor.” The influx of US corporates into Europe is showing no sign of abating. More than 15bn priced last week alone, despite unfavourable moves in the cross-currency basis swap over the course of the year so far. Market players say US companies can still save up to 15bp by issuing in euros, particularly in the longer maturities. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, and Wells Fargo are lead managers.

791,BRKa,REFILE-Warren Buffett shines spotlight on Europe's bond market,"(Refiles to correct date in dateline) * Berkshire Hathaway issues first ever euro bond * Investors scramble to buy ‘rare’ paper * More US companies could follow suit into euro market By Laura Benitez LONDON, March 6 (IFR) - Where Warren Buffett goes, others tend to follow, and bankers are predicting that Berkshire Hathaway’s euro debut will open the US corporate issuance floodgates further. So far this year, US firms have already sold an impressive 30bn or so, according to Thomson Reuters data. The US conglomerate dominated the market on Thursday with its 3bn three-tranche offering. And the action continued on Friday, with it being the most traded deal of the day, according to MarketAxess data. Berkshire Hathaway’s no-marketing policy outside of its shareholder meetings meant investors were given only a teaser announcement of its bond plans on Wednesday. But evidently that was all it needed: pre-reconciled orders amounted to EUR7.5bn, while all three bonds were the top traded at noon on Friday. Compare this to GDF’s landmark multi-tranche bond - incorporating the first vanilla note with a zero coupon from a corporate - that priced earlier this week. Not one of its four bonds made the top 10 traded on MarketAxess the day after they priced. While this data is based purely on MarketAxess’ post-trade service, Trax, and does not therefore capture all trading, the company does tend to process approximately 65% of fixed income transactions in Europe and its numbers therefore offer a relatively accurate reflection of volumes. According to one banker away from that deal, the allocation on GDF, mainly buy-and-hold real money, was a reason it did not feature. One of the leads also pointed out that none of the tranches was particularly large, so the bonds were perhaps less liquid. He added that since it priced investors have had a deluge of supply to focus upon, including that from Berkshire. “For European investors, it was the first opportunity for them to even look at Berkshire, so perhaps some needed the announcement to assess it. But with the market so hot and the company and its CEO being so high profile, we knew it was positioned well,” a lead on the transaction said. Lead managers Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo started marketing an eight-year tranche at 35bp area over mid-swaps, a 12-year at 50bp area and a 20-year at 65bp area, implying respective yields of around 0.90%, 1.34% and 1.75% for the Aa2/AA rated company. Those yields were much lower than the 3.20% coupon on a US$1.7bn bond that matured on February 11 this year which Berkshire is refinancing. Leads set official guidance at plus 30bp area, 45bp area and 60bp area, all to price within a 3bp range. Final terms were announced for a 750m eight-year at 27bp over mid-swaps, a 1.25bn 12-year at 42bp over and a 1bn 20-year at 57bp over. Berkshire’s eight-year tranche priced at a premium to where its US dollar deals trade around the same tenor. Its 3.00% February 2023s were quoted on Eikon at 55bp over swaps, although factoring in a euro/dollar cross-currency swap that is negative by around 40bp, this made for a premium of some 12bp on the euro issue. “Companies are having to pay up on the shorter deals at the moment; and on Berkshire’s shorter piece, leads should have left more on the table, as the shorter dated stuff is not well bid. Overall, the deal was well executed though and priced to perfection,” said Louis Gargour, CIO and managing partner at asset manager LNG Capital. The longer two tranches, due in 12 and 20 years, could have priced at relatively tighter terms post-swap, although any savings are theoretical, due to Berkshire Hathaway’s lack of outstanding longer dated dollar paper. “If swapped back into dollars, the eight-year comes around 10bp-15bp back of where the dollar bond trades,” a lead on the deal said. “So, if the company was swapping back, it would maybe be wider, although on the longer pieces they could have theoretically saved 10bp-15bp, but it’s tricky to assess as the curve is a weird shape,” the lead said. He added that for some US corporates tapping the euro market it is a cost-saving exercise, but others may be doing it to keep some of the proceeds in euros. Berkshire Hathaway has said it will use cash raised from the EUR3bn deal to refinance some maturing dollar debt, although market players believe it also has a more local investment plan in mind. “For where the swap rate is, I’m not sure if the deal makes sense. Maybe it’s a coincidence that the company is rumoured to be looking at investing in Germany, because raising euro funds for that reason would make more sense,” a banker away from the deal said. Berkshire Hathaway purchased a German retailer at the end of February, and chief executive Warren Buffet has since said he is ready to pay cash for more good German companies. The relentless surge of US corporates tapping the European bond market has continued unabated, partly due to the attractive basis swap levels between euros and dollars, despite this waning over the course of the year, especially for the shorter maturities. Last week saw more than 15bn of US corporate issuance, with the likes of Coca-Cola, AT&T; and Mondelez offering multi-tranche deals designed to appeal to a wide range of investors, and Priceline, Tyco Electronics and Moody’s adding single standalone maturities. Coca-Cola alone accounted for more than half the total - 8.5bn. Headline-grabbing, Berkshire Hathaway may encourage the theme to continue. “Since Berkshire priced, we’ve received at least three phone calls from US corporate treasurers enquiring about issuing in euros. I think Berkshire’s deal is going to prompt much more supply,” a syndicate official said.

792,BRKa,"Berkshire's railroad revamps service with billions, fewer cars","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stung by customer backlash over last winter’s patchy service, Berkshire Hathaway’s BNSF Railways invested billions in shoring up its operations. But in addition to hiring more than 7,000 new workers and spending $5.5 billion on improvements to its 32,500-mile (52,300 kilometer) network, the railway also has done something unexpected: it pulled thousands of rail cars off its lines. The strategy appears to have paid big dividends this winter, helping ease congestion on tracks and speed up traffic, according to a Reuters analysis of weekly data the industry supplies to the U.S. Department of Transportation. BNSF rail cars that were stuck at terminals for an average of 35 hours last winter are now back on the tracks in less than a day. The trains are also moving 15 percent faster than they did last year, reducing critical travel times, data shows. “BNSF disappointed many of its customers,” Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said in a letter to shareholders last month about last year’s performance of one of North America’s top railroads. “However, our outsized expenditures are beginning to show results.”  The railway’s metrics, which have not been previously reported, have improved markedly this winter, reflecting less congestion, increased investments and weaker demand from the oil and agricultural industries. Since October, BNSF has cut its number of cars by 9 percent to just under 237,000, whereas the rest of the industry grew by 0.4 percent. Anthony Hatch, owner of New York-based transportation consultancy ABH Consulting says all rail operators struggle to strike the balance between the number of cars on the tracks and freight volumes. BNSF is the only major U.S. rail operator, though, to cut the number of cars in the past two years. In its latest report, BNSF showed strong year-over-year increases in the number of carloads of grain and petroleum products hauled during the first two months of 2015 combined with double-digit declines in container and trailer volumes.  BNSF spokesman Mike Trevino said that improvements, such as building extra tracks and sidings, essentially allowed fewer cars to move the same amounts of freight.  “We did some things operationally that allowed us to take cars off the railroad while still being able to generate the same or better number of movements,” Trevino said.  Other major rail carriers also have spent billions on upgrades and bigger workforce, but none has reduced car counts or seen as dramatic improvements in travel speed and the time cars spent in terminals. CSX, which last year carried about a quarter of BNSF’s crude load, reported relatively steady car dwell times. Canadian Pacific, which faced similar criticism as the much larger BNSF, saw small overall decreases in dwell times. CSX spokeswoman Melanie Cost said the company has hired 1,900 frontline employees in 2014, bought new locomotives and upgraded lines where crude oil traffic has soared to ease capacity constraints and improve performance.  BNSF’s geographical focus on the nation’s Corn Belt states, along with North Dakota, a leading shale oil and grain producer, means it struggled more than its peers to keep up with demand generated by the oil boom and bumper crops. The stress, aggravated by a series of paralyzing winter storms, led to nagging delays that plagued major shippers and triggered scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and regulators. One refiner, Philadelphia Energy Solutions, was hit so hard by the delays last year that it ordered a half-dozen extra tankers of crude before the start of this winter season. This year, however, the extra reserve proved unnecessary, leaving the laden tankers idling offshore for months, according to a trader with knowledge of the situation. The company would not comment on its supplies.  Other big customers are also taking note of the improvement in areas served by BNSF, which pledged further $6 billion for capital maintenance in 2015 touting it the biggest amount ever invested in a single year by a North American rail company. “Rail was a lot better this year. We didn’t see the delays,”  said Mark Formo, president of the North Dakota Grain Growers Association. “In fact, we saw cars showing up for deliveries a day early.”  In a February survey by the Soy Transportation Coalition all respondents said cycle times – how long it takes a train to pick up a shipment, deliver it and return – have improved from last year. To be sure, some customers primarily credit fewer weather-related disruptions and cooled demand for oil-by-rail and grain shipments for better service. “To me it’s market driven,” said Brian Hammerbeck, president of Dakota Mill & Grain. “Prices are down, and you have farmers keeping more of it, so it’s a much different environment.” ABH’s Hatch says, however, many factors were at play, including rail operators’ determined push. “Weather helped, money helped, focus helped, time helped.”  ",3112015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-railways-commodities-bnsf-railway/berkshires-railroad-revamps-service-with-billions-fewer-cars-idUSKBN0M70B320150311

796,BRKa,China's BYD takes aim at Tesla in battery factory race,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Chinese automaker BYD (1211.HK) Co Ltd (002594.SZ), backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), aims to triple its production of batteries as it takes on Tesla Motors (TSLA.O) in the race to supply electric vehicles and boost energy storage. Shenzhen-based BYD plans to add 6 gigawatt hours of global production for batteries in each of the next three years, and hopes to keep adding at that pace afterwards if demand is solid, Matthew Jurjevich, a spokesman for the company, said on Friday.     That means BYD could ramp up from 10 GWh capacity at the end of this year to about 34 GWh of batteries by the beginning of 2020. This would put it about even with Tesla’s planned $5 billion Nevada gigafactory.     The companies are fast emerging as two of the key players in the nascent electricity storage sector. Storage technology is considered critical to integrating large amounts of renewable energy because it can absorb excess power from wind farms or solar panels and keep that for use when conditions don’t allow for power generation. “We have demonstrated that BYD is capable of adding 6 GWh every year with strong market demand,” Jurjevich, who works for BYD’s U.S. unit, said in an interview.         The sector has attracted Tesla, BYD and a range of startups as well as stalwart battery manufacturers and is expected to grow to $1.5 billion by 2019 from $128 million in 2014 in the United States alone, according to GTM Research. BYD, which declined to provide investment budgets, ended last year with 4 GWh of capacity and will be at 10 GWh later this year. The U.S. energy storage market is expected to triple this year to 220 MW, according to GTM. Most of BYD’s production is in China, but the company is opening a major new factory in Brazil this year that will contribute meaningfully to output next year, Jurjevich said.  BYD, which started out making mobile phone batteries, will also scale up manufacturing in the United States as demand for its batteries increases, he added.  According to data published last year by Lux Research, BYD is the sixth-biggest manufacturer of batteries for hybrid and plug-in vehicles. Panasonic Corporation (6752.T), which makes cells and batteries for Tesla, is the biggest.  Tesla, founded by entrepreneur Elon Musk, has said it will launch its own production of battery cells in Nevada in 2016 and reach 35 GWh of capacity by 2020. Tesla does not currently produce battery cells, according to a company spokeswoman.     BYD opened two manufacturing plants in Southern California in 2013 to produce both electric buses for public transportation and batteries. The company shocked many in 2003 when it launched its automotive business and has since become one of China’s most successful automakers. Outside of China, however, it has focused on selling buses rather than cars. BYD plans to deploy 70 megawatt hours of projects in that market in the United States this year, and has another 130 MWh of projects in its U.S. pipeline. It has already deployed 40 MWh of projects in North America with customers including Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Duke Energy Corp (DUK.N).

802,BRKa,China's Fosun ups stake in Belgian financial services firm RHJI,"SHANGHAI, March 24 (Reuters) - Fosun International Ltd  has raised its stake in Belgian financial services group RHJ International SA in a 59.1 million euros ($64.5 million) deal that extends the Chinese conglomerate’s global spending spree. Fosun, through two subsidiaries, will see its indirect stake in RHJI rise to 28.6 percent from 19.5 percent, the firm said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. Like Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Fosun is seeking to buy insurance assets to help it finance future investments. In the filing, the company said the RHJI deal would help it “strengthen its comprehensive financial capabilities and to better access other business opportunities in Europe”. Fosun recently struck deals in France and Britain, including the $1 billion dollar purchase of French holiday firm Club Mediterranee SA which was finalised last month.

Lazard could earn as much as $66 million in fees and Centerview could earn as much as $97 million, consulting firm Freeman & Co estimated.

Centerview had worked with both Kraft and Heinz. Large banks vie for big M&A; assignments by touting their financing capabilities and prowess in areas ranging from currency hedging to treasury management. Independent investment banks say their model poses fewer conflicts of interest and that full-service banks often seek to cross-sell products to clients.  The deal between Heinz and Kraft, which involves a stock exchange sweetened by a dividend financed by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G, required no bank financing and thus no need for involvement from large firms. Both 3G and Kraft sought to limit the number of advisers to avoid leaks of deal negotiations, according to people familiar with the deal.  Centerview, co-founded in 2006 by former UBS vice chairman Blair Efron and former Wasserstein Perella & Co president Robert Pruzan, has just 200 employees.

Centerview will jump from 14th place to sixth this year, up from eighth place this time last year. 3G has worked with Lazard often, including during the Brazilian group’s $3.3 billion acquisition of Burger King in 2010 and its acquisition of Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons last year.

804,BRKa,"UPDATE 7-Heinz deal for Kraft expands food larder for Buffett, 3G","(Adds details on deal value) * Kraft brands have opportunity to expand overseas * Kraft shareholders to hold 49 pct of Kraft Heinz Co * Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway to own over 320 mln shares * Buffett: “We will be in the stock forever” * Deal unlikely to face regulatory hurdles By Anjali Athavaley and Sruthi Ramakrishnan March 25 (Reuters) - Ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co, backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital, will combine with Kraft Foods Group Inc in a $46 billion deal to create the third-largest North American food company, executives said on Wednesday. Shares of Kraft, known for its namesake macaroni and cheese in a box, as well as Velveeta, Maxwell House coffee and Oscar Mayer processed meats, closed up nearly 36 percent at $83.17. The deal gives Buffett more leading U.S. food brands, as well as that of 3G founder Jorge Paulo Lemann, Brazil’s richest man. The two teamed up to buy control of Heinz in 2013 and collaborated on the 2014 merger of fast-food chain Burger King and Tim Hortons Inc, which runs coffee and doughnut shops. Food industry experts see Kraft benefiting from Heinz’s international presence, which generates more than 60 percent of its sales. Kraft brands are in 98 percent of North American households, the companies said, but would have a greater opportunity to expand overseas. The combined company, which will be publicly traded under the name Kraft Heinz Co, expects to save about $1.5 billion in annual costs by the end of 2017. 3G has a reputation for introducing aggressive cost cuts and improving efficiencies at other companies it has invested in, including Heinz and Anheuser-Busch InBev NV. “Mature businesses look for cost cutting. 3G takes cost cutting to a different level,” said Bob Goldin, executive vice president at food industry consultant Technomic. Goldin noted that neither Kraft nor Heinz are major players in the sector’s growth segments, from organic to fresh foods. The deal calls for the exchange of each Kraft share for one share in the combined Kraft Heinz Co, plus a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share to existing Kraft shareholders. The $10 billion behind the special dividend will be funded by an equity investment by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G. Heinz shareholders will own 51 percent of the combined company and Kraft shareholders the rest. The transaction is worth about $46 billion for Kraft shareholders, based on Kraft’s market capitalization of $36 billion on Tuesday before news of the deal emerged plus the special dividend. Packaged-food makers from Kraft to General Mills and Kellogg are battling sluggish demand as consumers shift to brands that are perceived as healthier, including foods that are organic or less processed. Kraft’s efforts to revamp its own products, such as combining its higher-protein snacks like meat and nuts into one container called the P3 pack, have not shifted the tide enough. In December, Kraft named John Cahill as chief executive, who acknowledged the company has not changed enough in the face of shifting consumer tastes. Cahill overhauled his leadership team last month, announcing the exit of three senior executives. Cahill said on a call with analysts that 3G Managing Director Alex Behring approached him at the end of January about a possible deal. The discussions picked up in the second half of February. While Kraft had been developing its own plan for change, the board saw the 3G opportunity as more compelling, said Cahill, who will be vice chairman of the combined company. Behring will serve as chairman of Kraft Heinz Co and Bernardo Hees, CEO of Heinz, will become CEO of the combined company. Kraft Heinz Co will retain headquarters both in the Chicago area and in Pittsburgh. It will have combined revenue of about $28 billion, about half that of market leader PepsiCo in 2014. Berkshire Hathaway will own more than 320 million of the approximately 1.22 billion Kraft Heinz shares outstanding, Buffett told CNBC, adding “We will be in the stock forever.” “Heinz goes back to 1859,” he said. “I think those tastes are pretty enduring. There will be plenty of people that want to eat other things, but there are many people who want to eat the products that Kraft/Heinz turn out” The deal is unlikely to face regulatory hurdles as there is little overlap in products, antitrust experts said. Areas that could draw regulatory scrutiny include steak sauces - Kraft makes A1 and Heinz makes Lea & Perrins. “Whatever divestitures there are will be easy, and they will be kind of minor,” said Fiona Scott Morton, who teaches economics at the Yale University School of Management. Industry watchers had speculated for months that 3G would buy another food company after the Heinz acquisition. Kraft’s appeal, according to some, is that its brands occupy shelf space in the center of many stores, just like Heinz. That could lead to cost savings in merchandising and sales. Kraft is 3G Capital’s fifth major deal in the food and beverage industry since 2008, when it engineered the takeover of Anheuser-Busch by brewer InBev. 3G Capital also controls Restaurant Brands International Inc , formed when Burger King business bought Canada’s Tim Hortons. 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway acquired Heinz for $23.2 billion in 2013. Kraft split into two companies in 2012, with Kraft Foods focusing on grocery products in North America and Mondelez International Inc on snack products. Lazard was Heinz’s financial adviser, while Cravath, Swaine & Moore and Kirkland and Ellis were its legal advisers.

The company’s proposed merger with ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co sent shares of the maker of Velveeta cheese up by more than 40 percent - but the gains pale in comparison to the jump in the value of its options.

The calls were set to expire on June 19 and were betting on the shares rising above $67.50 by that date. The shares were $61.65 at that time. Since each options contract represents a 100 shares of the underlying stock, the trader would have paid about $700,000. On Wednesday, the options traded as high as $20.10, according to Thomson Reuters data. “It might be nothing more than lucky timing. On the other hand, news of the deal might have been leaked and motivated the call buying in Kraft,” said Fred Ruffy, options strategist at WhatsTrading.com.

Kraft is not the only company to attract bullish activity over the last few weeks. Options on food and beverage companies such as Campbell Soup Co, PepsiCo Inc and Coca-Cola Co have also seen a surge in bullish options bets. Options activity has been known to spike before the public announcement of deals and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has in the past announced enforcement action for alleged insider trading involving options trading.

811,BRKa,"Small is beautiful for Kraft, Heinz investment bankers","March 25 (Reuters) - Lazard Ltd and Centerview Partners LLC have only a fraction of the staff and resources of their larger investment banking brethren, such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Yet the independent investment banks won the biggest deal of the year so far, the merger of H.J. Heinz Co and Kraft Foods Group Inc, using their sector expertise and personal relationships with company executives. Lazard and Centerview were the only investment banks advising the two companies on the deal announced on Wednesday. Lazard could earn as much as $66 million in fees and Centerview could earn as much as $97 million, according to estimates from consulting firm Freeman & Co. Lazard has a long-standing relationship with Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital Partners LP, the co-owner of Heinz along with Warren Buffetts’ Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Centerview has worked previously with both Kraft and Heinz. Large banks tout their financing capabilities as well as their prowess in areas ranging from currency hedging to treasury management in order to win big M&A; assignments. Independent investment banks, however, argue that their model poses fewer conflicts of interest than that of full-service banks, which often seek to cross-sell products to clients. Centerview, co-founded in 2006 by former UBS vice chairman Blair Efron and former Wasserstein Perella & Co president Robert Pruzan, has just 200 employees. Lazard employed over 2,500 people as of Dec. 31. The deal between Heinz and Kraft, which involves a stock exchange sweetened by a dividend financed by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G, required no bank financing and thus no need for involvement from large firms. 3G has worked with Lazard many times in the past, including the Brazilian group’s $3.3 billion acquisition of Burger King in 2010 and its acquisition of Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons last year. Former Lazard banker Antonio Weiss has a longstanding relationship with 3G, helping to advise brewer InBev, backed in part by 3G founder Jorge Paulo Lemann, on its acquisition of Anheuser-Busch in 2008. Weiss later advised the combined company on its $20 billion buyout of Grupo Modelo in 2013. Lazard CEO Ken Jacobs helped lead the deal for the firm after Weiss left Wall Street earlier this year to serve in the U.S. Treasury department. Centerview, meanwhile, worked with Kraft during its 2010 acquisition of chocolate maker Cadbury. The firm also advised H.J. Heinz during the ketchup maker’s takeover by 3G in 2013.

813,BRKa,3G to use its cost-cutting playbook on Kraft after Heinz merger,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Kraft Foods Group merges with H.J. Heinz Co, they will share a name, a central place in the American kitchen and two headquarters near Chicago and Pittsburgh. But that dual office structure may soon change, according to some industry watchers. If history is any guide, their new owners will wrest an expected $1.5 billion in annual cost savings by 2017 by removing duplicate operations, slashing perks such as the use of private jets, while scrutinizing even the most mundane expenses. “There is going to be a lot of headcount reduction,” said Bob Goldin, executive vice president of food consultancy Technomic. “You will see some portfolio pruning. They aren’t going to have two headquarters for long.” Heinz’s backer, Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital Partners, has made a name for itself by aggressively trimming the fat from food and beer companies struggling for growth.  3G is considered “the most aggressive in the industry in terms of running businesses on a very lean basis and maximizing margins and cash flow,” said Kevin Dreyer, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, which owns roughly a million shares of Kraft. “It’s certainly a good thing for holders.” 3G Managing Partner Alex Behring made clear on Wednesday, when the $46 billion deal was announced [ID: nL2N0WR2GF], that it would implement a strategy of zero-based budgeting at Kraft Heinz Co when it comes to the company’s cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses. The concept requires management to start each new budget year by justifying all costs from scratch, rather than the  traditional method of basing their new budget on the previous year’s figures and then only having to justify any changes. Some analysts say it is likely that 3G will exceed its savings target. It represents 6 percent of the cost base of Heinz and Kraft combined, according to Dave Novosel, senior analyst who covers both Heinz and Kraft for Gimme Credit, which provides independent research on corporate bonds. When 3G teamed up with billionaire investor Warren Buffett to buy Heinz in 2013, the cuts quickly followed. They included cutting 7,000 jobs in an 18-month period, closing six factories and many smaller curbs on spending – including limiting employee use of company printers to 200 pages per month.  At the time, Pittsburgh-based Heinz had separate offices to serve as its North American headquarters and its global headquarters. Those two operations were quickly consolidated into one, smaller office, according to a person close to Heinz. The copier restrictions extended to requiring printing on two sides of a page, and a reduction in the use of color printing, the person said. Investors and analysts have generally cheered the results. 3G says that Heinz is now the most profitable food company in the industry.  The changes are typical of 3G’s playbook. When 3G-backed Belgian brewer InBev NV acquired the largest U.S. beer producer, Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc, to form Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) in 2008, aggressive cost cutting soon followed. And after it took control of Burger King in 2010, 3G slashed hundreds of jobs at the fast-food chain’s Miami headquarters, got rid of  swanky offices and sold the corporate jet. It also took labor and operational costs off its books by franchising more than 1,300 restaurants.       “When they see something that isn’t working, they eliminate it,” said Gary Stibel, founder of the New England Consulting Group, whose clients have included both Kraft and Heinz. “It’s a very healthy diet for the company, whether it’s in food, beverage or otherwise, and it does work.” He added, “It’s taken the food industry a long time to consolidate to this degree. It isn’t over. Others will learn from what they’re doing.” To be sure, 3G and Kraft highlighted on Wednesday the growth potential for the combined entity as well. Heinz gets access to Kraft’s well-known brands like Oscar Mayer and Velveeta, while the mac and cheese maker can use Heinz’s distribution network to broaden its reach internationally.  But in the United States, where packaged food makers have struggled to increase sales in the face of changing eating habits, boosting sales will be challenging.  “It’s much more of a margin story than a top line story,” Dreyer said.

The Shenzhen-based company made a net profit of 433.5 million yuan ($69.76 million), compared with 553.1 million yuan in 2013, it said in a statement posted on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange website. China’s vehicle sales rose 6.9 percent last year and are expected to grow 7 percent in 2015, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. BYD vehicle sales volume for its main brand grew 4.1 percent in 2014 compared with a year earlier. BYD, originally a maker of mobile phone batteries, has grown into one of the largest independent car brands by specializing in electric and hybrid vehicles. The company has taken aim beyond China, entering new markets including Thailand, Japan and the US initially with electric buses and taxis, while also declaring its intentions to increase triple battery production to rival Tesla Motor’s  planned gigafactory.

816,BRKa,"Buffett says if he ran Fed, he would not raise rates significantly","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, the billionaire chief executive officer and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), said he would not raise interest rates significantly if he ran the Federal Reserve. “I probably wouldn’t do much,” Buffett said when asked what he would do if he ran the Fed. “Things are working pretty well, and I would be worried that if I raised rates significantly with negative interest rates in Europe, I would be very worried about what that would do to the flow of funds.” He also noted that the economy “is improving month by month.” Buffett spoke at an automotive industry conference in New York, along with the chairman of the Berkshire Hathaway automotive dealer group, Larry Van Tuyl. Buffett and Van Tuyl said that Berkshire Hathaway Automotive is actively looking to purchase more dealerships to add to the 81 auto dealerships it now owns in 10 states. Van Tuyl said that the company will look to expand in the United States and not internationally, at least for now. Buffett said that Berkshire Hathaway will price auto dealerships for possible acquisition by using a long-term outlook and not allow short-term swings of the U.S. auto market to affect purchase decisions. He also said those purchase decisions will not be related to changes in interest rates.  “If (Federal Reserve Chair) Janet Yellen came up and whispered in my ear what she was going to do for the next two years, it wouldn’t make any difference what we do. If we got a chance to buy a dealership at a sensible price with the right people, we’d buy it. We’d buy it in five minutes.” Buffett and Van Tuyl both said that while Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) has a model of selling cars directly to consumers, the volume is too low to affect the U.S. auto distribution system. “Usually when a distribution system becomes that firmly established, there is a reason for it. I just don’t see that changing,” said Buffett. He said that self-driving cars will “be a reality” but that he expects autonomous cars to be less than 10 percent of the auto market by 2030. Earlier Tuesday, at the same National Automobile Dealers Association-J.D. Power conference in New York, Buffett said a Greek exit could be constructive for the euro zone.

826,BRKa,UPDATE 1-Ex-AIG chief Greenberg's bid to toss N.Y. case rejected,"(Adds comments from both sides, background) By Karen Freifeld and Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK, April 16 (Reuters) - A New York state appeals court rejected former American International Group Inc  Chairman Maurice “Hank” Greenberg’s bid to dismiss a lawsuit accusing him of orchestrating an accounting fraud at the insurer he ran for nearly four decades. Thursday’s unanimous decision by the state Appellate Division suggests a trial may finally take place soon, after a decade of sometimes-vitriolic legal wrangling between Greenberg, who turns 90 next month, and three New York attorneys general. The court said current Attorney General Eric Schneiderman can pursue his effort to ban Greenberg from the securities industry and from serving as an officer or director of a public company. It also called Schneiderman’s bid to recoup millions of dollars of allegedly ill-gotten bonuses “legally viable.” Greenberg and co-defendant Howard Smith, a former AIG chief financial officer, are accused of having tried to hide losses at AIG through fraudulent transactions, including with a reinsurance unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc . The court said the defendants failed to show no connection between the wrongdoing and the alleged bonuses, and did not show conclusively that an injunction was not warranted under the Martin Act, New York state’s powerful securities fraud law. Greenberg may appeal, according to Stephen Aiello, a spokesman for insurance company C.V. Starr & Co Inc, where Greenberg is chairman and chief executive. “This lawsuit has absolutely no merit,” Aiello said. “This case is a waste of taxpayer money.” Vincent Sama, a lawyer for Smith, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Schneiderman inherited the lawsuit from predecessors Eliot Spitzer and Andrew Cuomo. He was forced to drop claims for as much as $6 billion in damages, in the wake of a class action settlement between AIG shareholders and the executives. Critics, including former New York Governors Mario Cuomo and George Pataki, have questioned the need to pursue the case once damages could not be collected. But Schneiderman has said executives who perpetrate fraud should be held publicly accountable. “We look forward to presenting the people’s case at trial,” Liz DeBold, a spokeswoman for Schneiderman, said on Thursday. The defendants were accused of orchestrating a $500 million transaction with Berkshire’s General Re unit to boost loss reserves without transferring risk, and a transaction with Capco Reinsurance Co to hide a $210 million underwriting loss. Mario Cuomo, Andrew’s father, died in January. Buffett and Berkshire were not accused of wrongdoing.

828,BRKa,UPDATE 2-U.S. Supreme Court rejects Rajat Gupta's insider trading appeal,"(Adds details on case, paragraphs 2, 5-10) By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON, April 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday left intact the 2012 insider trading conviction of former Goldman Sachs Group Inc director Rajat Gupta. Gupta is the highest-ranking corporate official to be convicted in the U.S. government’s multi-year probe of insider trading in the hedge fund industry. The high court rejected Gupta’s appeal of a March 2014 ruling by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that had upheld his conviction. The government used wiretap evidence to show that Gupta leaked news about Goldman’s finances, including a crucial investment by prominent investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, by phone to Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam. Gupta, 66, is serving a two-year prison sentence stemming from his conviction. He was also ordered to make $6 million in restitution to Goldman and pay a $5 million fine. Gupta is scheduled to be released from prison in March 2016. A jury convicted Gupta in June 2012 of passing to Rajaratnam confidential information he learned from Goldman board meetings, including a crucial investment by Buffett. Rajaratnam is serving an 11-year prison sentence. The Supreme Court rejected his appeal in June 2014. In January, the Supreme Court rejected Gupta’s separate challenge to a permanent ban from acting as a public company officer. The court then left intact a June 2014 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling upholding the sanctions. In addition to the officer ban, Gupta was prohibited from further violating securities law and associating with brokers, dealers or investment advisors. While Gupta’s appeals at the Supreme Court have failed, he launched a new challenge last month to his conviction at the lower court level before U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, citing a recent federal appellate court ruling that has limited authorities’ abilities to pursue insider trading cases. The case on which the court acted on Monday was Gupta v. U.S., U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-534 ",4202015,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-insidertrading/update-2-u-s-supreme-court-rejects-rajat-guptas-insider-trading-appeal-idUSL1N0XH0TV20150420

830,BRKa,Warren Buffett losing some mojo on his economic 'moats',"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett has carved out a core stock-picking strategy of investing in companies with strong economic “moats,” businesses that have built, fortified and generated success from well-known brands that make it difficult for them to succumb to competitive forces.  But for a number of holdings in his stock portfolio, the moats may be drying up and the walls could be breached.  Stalwarts like International Business Machines (IBM.N), Coca-Cola Inc (KO.N), Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) to name a few have showed declining revenue trends in recent years, and face competition that may make it more difficult for them to outperform the market in the way they did in the past.  When Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), the conglomerate Buffett has run since 1965, releases quarterly results on Friday - which will follow with his annual gathering in Omaha, Nebraska - it is likely to show that his largest equity-market positions trailed the broad-market Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  On average, the 15 biggest positions he owned at the end of 2014 have gained 7.8 percent in the last 12 months, compared with a 13.1 percent rise for the S&P.;  Buffett supporters - and there are many - would say that the 84-year-old investor is hardly looking at the short term, but what stands out about some of the larger holdings are weakening revenue trends that augur for concern about the long-term, not just the short term.  “The moats are not as deep and unimpenetrable as in the past,” said Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Investment Partners in Palm Beach, Florida, and has questioned Buffett’s investments in the past. He currently has no position in the stock.      That is not to say Buffett is any kind of a slouch. Those 15 holdings, over the last five years, on average, are ahead of the S&P;, with an average gain of 85 percent, compared with the S&P;’s 78 percent rise.  And he can still be opportunistic, as in the aftermath of the financial crisis when he acquired a $750 million position in Goldman Sachs Group Inc that’s now worth $2.5 billion, and an option to buy 700 million shares in Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) for $5 billion - now worth $11.2 billion.  What’s less clear, however, is whether these previously unassailable franchises are facing competitive pressures that will continue to hurt sales growth. Buffett owns 76.9 million shares of IBM that as of last year had cost him $13.2 billion, and that position is underwater; IBM is trying to reverse 12 straight quarters of year-over-year revenue declines as it plays catch-up in the cloud computing space. Two other large positions, Coca-Cola and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), are also struggling. Wells Fargo has had three straight quarters of year-over-year revenue growth, but that followed 18 quarters of decline. Revenue growth has fallen for Coke in 8 of the last 9 quarters as the company deals with changing consumer tastes. But of course, Buffett’s total cost for his 400 million shares of Coke was $1.3 billion. As of Wednesday, it was worth $16.2 billion. “Since he bought it in the 1980s, his return from stock price appreciation and dividends received has been terrific, and will likely continue compounding for years to come,” said Ken Shubin Stein, founder and portfolio manager at Spencer Capital Management. Berkshire did not respond to requests from Reuters for comment. It remains to be seen whether Buffett’s portfolio sees a greater shift with the increased influence of Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, the two men handling portfolio management for the last few years. Berkshire’s annual letter lists only the 15 largest positions in the portfolio - many of which predate the two executives - so it is possible that there are other, smaller positions that are big winners. Weschler and Combs are credited with buying DirecTV for Berkshire, which has a 54 percent gain for them. On the other hand, last year Berkshire sold U.K. food retailer Tesco, which Berkshire took a $444 million loss. Kass even acknowledges that Buffett’s ability to hunt for unknowns now would not be easy given the firm’s size and stature, in the way he did early in his investing career.  Other investors believe that for Buffett to change his approach would be foolish at this stage of the game.  “His shareholders, I think, would get unnerved if he woke up one day and said, ‘Yeah, you know, I’m wrong, let’s buy Apple,’” said Jeff Matthews, who runs Ram Partners, a Naples, Florida-based hedge fund, owns Berkshire shares in his personal account, and has written several books about Buffett. “When you compound at 20 percent a year for 50 years and that’s better than anybody, how do you start picking that apart just because he didn’t own Apple?” (Edits paragraph 13 to provide complete name)  ",4302015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-buffett/warren-buffett-losing-some-mojo-on-his-economic-moats-idUSKBN0NL1BJ20150430

Cable company Charter Communications Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue below estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Reuters reported on Monday that Time Warner Cable was open to merger discussions with Charter. Investors will be interested in whether Charter, backed by activist investor John Malone, will make a second bid for Time Warner Cable. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc is expected to report first-quarter results. The company is expected to benefit from growth in the U.S. economy, given Berkshire’s diversification with close to 90 operating businesses in areas such as insurance, energy, food, industrial products and a railroad. Berkshire also owns well over $100 billion in stock, with big stakes in American Express, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. The company’s results will come a day before its annual meeting in Omaha, where shareholders will celebrate Buffett’s imminent 50th anniversary at Berkshire’s helm, and listen to him and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger answer questions from them, journalists and analysts. The U.S. Commerce Department is expected to report that construction spending rose 0.5 percent in March after slipping 0.1 percent in February. (1000/1400) The Institute for Supply Management is expected to report that its national factory index rose to 52 in April from 51.5 in March. (1000/1400) Automobile manufacturers are expected to report that sales moderated to a 16.9 million-unit rate in April after rising to a 17.15 million-unit rate in March. (1330/1730) Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester, who speaks on “Consumer Credit: Suggested Future Directions for Policy-Relevant Research” before the Conference on Regulating Consumer Credit in Philadelphia, will weigh in on the just-released FOMC statement, in which investors get a sense of how much the economy’s weak winter surprised policymakers. Toward the hawkish end of Fed officials, Mester could double down on her previous recommendation to hike rates in June. (0830/1230) San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams, a policy centrist with a vote this year on Federal Reserve interest rate policy, is among the first policymakers to speak after the Fed emerges from its self-imposed communications blackout following its April 28-29 meeting. Was the tone of that meeting dovish, hawkish or somewhere in between? The title of his speech at the Chapman University Conference in Orange, California, “Monetary Policy in Financial Markets: Is there a New Paradigm?” gives few hints, but he will be asked for his view of recent weak economic data and prospects of a rate hike in the coming months. (1545/1945) TransCanada Corp, Canada’s second-largest pipeline company, is scheduled to report first-quarter results. It reported a better-than-expected fourth quarter profit in February, driven mainly by increased earnings from its Canadian operations. Power company Duke Energy Corp is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit, hurt by rising costs. The company is increasing reliance on natural gas and is retiring some coal plants to comply with U.S. environmental regulations. Lower income from the company’s operations outside North America has also weighed on profits in recent quarters. Investors will want to know about Duke’s expectations for its utilities holdings, demand and operations in markets other than North America. Drug chain CVS Health Corp will report first-quarter results before the markets open. According to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, the company will beat both profit and sales forecasts for the quarter. Credit rating agency Moody’s Corp is expected to report a rise in first-quarter profit, helped by strong growth in its analytics business and higher debt issuance in the United States. Analysts expect Moody’s to benefit from a rise in corporate bond refinancing cycle and diminishing regulatory risk. CBOE Holdings Inc, the operator of the largest U.S. stock options market, is set to report weak first-quarter results as volumes have been soft. Investors are waiting to hear the management’s projections for volumes for the remainder of the year. Tesla Motors Inc CEO Elon Musk is expected to announce details of a home electricity storage system built around Tesla batteries and take some questions. Tesla’s stock has risen in anticipation of the new effort to expand demand for Tesla batteries, which will be made at a factory in Nevada, and reap additional government clean power subsidies.

832,BRKa,Berkshire profit up 10 percent as railroad rebounds,"OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Friday said first-quarter profit rose 10 percent, and operating results easily beat forecasts, boosted by its railroad and insurance businesses and gains from derivatives. Net income for the Omaha, Nebraska-based insurance and investment conglomerate rose to $5.16 billion, or $3,143 per share, from $4.71 billion, or $2,862, a year earlier. Quarterly operating profit increased 20 percent to $4.24 billion, or $2,583 per share, from $3.53 billion, or $2,149. Analysts on average expected operating profit of about $2,373 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 7 percent to $48.64 billion. Book value per share, Buffett’s preferred measure of growth, rose 0.5 percent from year-end to $146,963. Cathy Seifert, an analyst at S&P; Capital IQ, called results “really strong,” in contrast to many companies in sectors where Berkshire competes that have posted “middling” performance. Results were released one day before Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, where shareholders are expected to celebrate Buffett’s 50th anniversary at Berkshire’s helm. Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger will field five hours of questions at the meeting, which is expected to draw more than 40,000 shareholders. It is part of a weekend of events throughout Omaha that Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists.” Once a struggling textile mill, Berkshire now has more than 80 operating companies in the energy, food, industrial products, insurance, railroad and other sectors, and owns more than $115 billion of stocks.  Profit from the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad totaled $1.05 billion, up 44 percent from a year earlier, when bad weather and congestion led to what Berkshire called “substandard” service that left many customers unhappy. Berkshire attributed the better performance this year to increased capacity, new equipment and other upgrades made as part of a $6 billion capital improvement program that will continue this year. “It’s good to see the railroad recovering. That’s the most important driver here,” said Jeff Matthews, who runs the Ram Partners hedge fund in Naples, Florida, owns Berkshire shares in his own account, and has written several books about Buffett. Berkshire recorded $857 million of profit from derivatives, primarily from contracts that will benefit Berkshire if stock markets rise over the long-term. The stronger U.S. dollar added to these gains by reducing liabilities under contracts denominated in foreign currencies. Accounting rules require Berkshire to report derivatives gains with quarterly results. Buffett downplays their importance, saying they do not reflect business performance. Currency fluctuations also boosted results at a unit that insures against major catastrophes, contributing to a 15 percent overall profit jump in insurance to $1.36 billion. Not all insurance businesses fared well. Underwriting profit at the auto insurer Geico fell 55 percent as it paid out more to cover claims, causing it to increase premium rates. Jeff Hull, senior financial adviser at Manulife Securities Inc in Toronto, said Geico is facing pressures from rivals that are slashing prices. “I would like to see it a bit stronger,” said Hull, who owns Berkshire shares. “Overall the company is still doing okay.” Meanwhile, the General Re reinsurer lost money from underwriting, as it struggled with price competition, higher claims and currency losses in its international operations. Among other businesses, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility unit that Berkshire owns most of, saw profit fall 7 percent to $421 million, reflecting lower revenues from natural gas operations. Berkshire also has dozens of smaller businesses that sell, among other things, Benjamin Moore paint, Borsheim’s jewelry, Brooks athletic shoes, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, Johns Manville insulation and See’s candies. The company ended the quarter with $63.71 billion of cash, enough to fund one or more giant acquisitions. It will own a roughly 27 percent stake in Kraft Heinz Co after H.J. Heinz Co, now owned by Berkshire and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital, buys Kraft Foods Group Inc, combining Kraft, Heinz, Oscar Mayer, Philadelphia, Velveeta and other brands under one roof. Major stock holdings, meanwhile, include American Express Co, Coca-Cola Co, International Business Machines Corp and Wells Fargo & Co. In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares closed up $2,400 at $215,800, and its Class B shares rose $2.15 to $143.36. The shares are about 6 percent below their record highs set last Dec. 8. Berkshire’s market value is roughly $355 billion, ranking fifth among publicly-traded U.S. companies.

835,BRKa,"As NetJets pilots seek contract, Buffett says he is not anti-union","OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday denied that he had any anti-union agenda, as the NetJets luxury aviation unit of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc tries to end roughly two years of contentious contract talks with its pilots. Buffett spoke at Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, as some NetJets pilots picketed outside. The NetJets Association of Shared Aircraft Pilots, which represents more than 2,700 of those pilots, is resisting what they call NetJets’ efforts to cut its budget, reduce jobs, and obtain concessions on health care, job security and work rules. “We have no anti-union agenda whatsoever,” said Buffett, who has flown on NetJets planes for 20 years. “It’s perfectly understandable that employers and employees have some differences from time to time. We’ll get it worked out, but that doesn’t necessarily comes in a day or a week or a month.” NetJets specializes in “fractional” aircraft ownership, which lets individuals and companies buy shares of private jets, enabling them to travel on short notice with greater privacy than on commercial aircraft. The pilots group in December sued NetJets, accusing it of baiting pilots through bogus postings on Twitter to conduct work slowdowns for which they could be fired, and publishing photos of pilots engaged in lawful picketing. NetJets has denied wrongdoing. While it has returned to profitability after a $711 million loss in 2009, it has said it must be better prepared for economic slowdowns. Buffett said he had recalled only three businesses in his 50 years at Berkshire where there were strikes, including at See’s Candies. He also rejected the idea it was a mistake for Berkshire to buy NetJets, for which it paid $725 million in 1998. “NetJets is a very decent business,” he said. “We have very professional pilots, and we have at the moment have a difference of opinion about the contract, and that will get settled.” The NetJets pilots’ lawsuit is in Columbus, Ohio, where the company has operations. Berkshire is based in Omaha. ",5022015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-buffett-netjets/as-netjets-pilots-seek-contract-buffett-says-he-is-not-anti-union-idUSKBN0NN0PS20150502
836,BRKa,Warren Buffett denies that Berkshire Hathaway 'too big to fail',"OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday rejected the idea that Berkshire Hathaway Inc, a sprawling conglomerate he has built over 50 years, has grown so big that it is now too big to fail and requires tighter regulatory oversight. “There is no reason, in logic or in terms of what we’ve heard, to think that Berkshire would be designated as a SIFI,” Buffett said at Berkshire’s annual meeting, using the acronym for systemically important financial institution. “I do not think Berkshire comes within miles of qualifying as a SIFI.” The SIFI designation forces companies to submit to Federal Reserve oversight, and could make them adopt tighter capital and liquidity requirements that could impede growth and profitability. Buffett and his second-in-command, Charlie Munger, were fielding questions at the annual shareholder meeting. Buffett was responding to a question about how the SIFI designation would affect Berkshire. The focus on Berkshire’s size has grown over the years as Berkshire has amassed more than 80 businesses, including capital-intensive businesses such as the Burlington Northern railroad, and units that insure against major catastrophes. Those catastrophes can be costly, and both the September 11  attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon as well as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 cost Berkshire billions of dollars. Buffett, however, has pledged to maintain a $20 billion cash cushion at Berkshire - it has $63.7 billion now - to protect against such problems. Moreover, Berkshire gained a reputation during the global financial crisis as a source of liquidity, investing in companies as diverse as Goldman Sachs Group Inc, General Electric Co and motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc. Other companies with big insurance operations that have the SIFI moniker include American International Group Inc, MetLife Inc and Prudential Financial Inc. MetLife is suing to reverse that designation. ",5022015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-buffett-size/warren-buffett-denies-that-berkshire-hathaway-too-big-to-fail-idUSKBN0NN0P920150502
837,BRKa,"Buffett celebrates 50th year at Berkshire, faces tough questions","OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders on Saturday celebrated Warren Buffett’s 50th anniversary running the conglomerate, as the billionaire expressed optimism the company would thrive over the long haul, even after he is gone. Buffett and his second-in-command, Charlie Munger, fielded five hours of questions from shareholders, analysts and journalists at Berkshire’s annual meeting, including some that criticized the business practices of firms that Berkshire owns or works with, such as Brazil’s 3G Capital. The meeting had a more festive air this year, with one of the more than 40,000 people who attended shouting out “Warren and Charlie, we love you” at the start of the main event of what Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists.” “It’s not Disneyland, it’s Warrenland,” said David Rolfe, chief investment officer of Wedgewood Partners Inc. Berkshire holds more than 80 companies including the Burlington Northern railroad, Geico car insurance, Benjamin Moore paint, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, and See’s candies, and owns more than $115 billion of stocks. Its breadth and depth, which includes $63.7 billion of cash, has given Berkshire a strong balance sheet that Buffett said will help it thrive should the economy, propped up by low interest rates that many expect to rise soon, heads south. “We will be very willing to act if economic turbulence of any kind occurs, and will be prepared, and most people won’t be,” he said. He denied that Berkshire needed special regulatory oversight by possibly having become too big to fail. Buffett gave no hints about who would succeed him. He also alluded in one answer to his writing another of his popular letters to shareholders next February, suggesting no intention to leave soon. Yet he said he would not want someone whose sole background is in investments to become chief executive. “I would not want to put someone in charge of Berkshire with only investing experience and not any operational experience.”  Buffett also offered ringing praise for the turnaround at Burlington Northern, Berkshire’s largest noninsurance unit, which was plagued last year by service delays. “The improvement has been huge, and I want to thank Matt Rose and Carl Ice for their really extraordinary performance,” he said, referring to the railroad’s executive chairman and chief executive. Rose, considered by some a potential Berkshire CEO candidate, was not mentioned by Buffett in his annual letter, which led some to believe his standing had been lowered. Other potential CEO candidates include insurance executive Ajit Jain, whose decision to join Berkshire three decades ago was hailed by Buffett as one of the “luckiest” events he experienced, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy chief Gregory Abel, who talked at the meeting about renewable energy. He was the only person other than Buffett and Munger to field a question. Ken Shubin Stein, founder of Spencer Capital Management LLC in New York, said having a CEO with an operational background “makes sense since the CEO needs to work with the investment team and understand their use of capital for investments, versus using the capital for investing in acquisitions.” As is usually the case, no major controversy has been hanging over Berkshire. But Buffett did get two questions that led him to praise 3G Capital, which critics say ruthlessly cuts jobs at companies it acquires. In 2013, Berkshire and 3G bought H.J. Heinz Co, which is now buying Kraft Foods Group Inc. “The 3G people have been successful in building marvelous businesses,” Buffett said. “I don’t know of any company that has a policy that says we’re going to have a lot more people than they need.” Buffett also defended Berkshire’s Clayton Homes manufactured homes unit, which was criticized in a recent Seattle Times article for predatory sales practices that can trap low-income borrowers in homes they cannot afford.  “I make no apologies whatsoever for Clayton’s lending terms,” he said, adding that Clayton itself faces losses when borrowers default. Buffett also said he expects a contentious contract dispute between Berkshire’s luxury aircraft unit NetJets and its pilots to be resolved, and said he had “no anti-union agenda whatsoever.” Some of the pilots picketed outside the meeting. Addressing a question about Berkshire’s stakes in companies including Coca-Cola Co that sell highly sugared products, Buffett said companies can change as consumer tastes evolve. Alluding to his own well-publicized fondness for junk food, he said: “If I had been eating broccoli and Brussels sprouts all my life, I don’t think I would live as long.” Buffett also said the euro currency “can and probably should survive,” but that “real changes” would probably be required. Munger, for his part, said European leaders created a “flawed system” that was “probably unwise” by letting countries that were too weak adopt the currency. Berkshire’s annual meeting is Omaha’s top annual draw other than baseball’s College World Series - reflected in hotel rooms that can fetch more than $400 a night and that often sell out nearly a year in advance.

838,BRKa,Buffett says 'no apologies' for Clayton Homes' lending practices,"OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Saturday defended his Clayton Homes unit against accusations that the manufactured home seller had preyed on lower-income purchasers with its lending practices. “I make no apologies whatsoever about Clayton’s lending terms,” said Buffett, speaking at the annual meeting of his sprawling Berkshire Hathaway Inc conglomerate. The meeting was expected to draw upwards of 40,000 people. The Seattle Times and the Center for Public Integrity in April published a report suggesting that Clayton Homes traps buyers with high interest rates, leaving them with unaffordable loans on depreciating homes. But Buffett said that because many of Clayton’s buyers posed higher risks, charging them higher interest rates was justified. “It’s true that manufactured housing hits the lower end of the market,” he said. The main question is whether a company can make sensible loans to people so that they can continue making those payments and keep their houses, Buffett added. In that regard, Clayton has been “exemplary,” he said. It is equally important, said Buffett, that Clayton shared the risk with buyers because the manufactured home maker and finance company keeps ownership of the loans it originates. “If we make a mistake, it hurts them and it hurts us, and that is a very unusual arrangement in the financial industry.” He listed the main causes of default as job loss, divorce and death. “That happens with high-priced houses as well,” he said. “It happens more often with people who are living closer to the edge, but I don’t think that’s a reason to deny them a house.” Clayton is one of more than 80 companies owned by Berkshire Hathaway, which also counts Geico insurance [BRKGE.UL], Dairy Queen and the BNSF railroad [BNISF.UL] among its holdings.

840,BRKa,"As NetJets pilots seek contract, Buffett says he is not anti-union","OMAHA, Neb., May 2 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday denied that he had any anti-union agenda, as the NetJets luxury aviation unit of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc tries to end roughly two years of contentious contract talks with its pilots. Buffett spoke at Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, as some NetJets pilots picketed outside. The NetJets Association of Shared Aircraft Pilots, which represents more than 2,700 of those pilots, is resisting what they call NetJets’ efforts to cut its budget, reduce jobs, and obtain concessions on health care, job security and work rules. “We have no anti-union agenda whatsoever,” said Buffett, who has flown on NetJets planes for 20 years. “It’s perfectly understandable that employers and employees have some differences from time to time. We’ll get it worked out, but that doesn’t necessarily comes in a day or a week or a month.” NetJets specializes in “fractional” aircraft ownership, which lets individuals and companies buy shares of private jets, enabling them to travel on short notice with greater privacy than on commercial aircraft. The pilots group in December sued NetJets, accusing it of baiting pilots through bogus postings on Twitter to conduct work slowdowns for which they could be fired, and publishing photos of pilots engaged in lawful picketing. NetJets has denied wrongdoing. While it has returned to profitability after a $711 million loss in 2009, it has said it must be better prepared for economic slowdowns. Buffett said he had recalled only three businesses in his 50 years at Berkshire where there were strikes, including at See’s Candies. He also rejected the idea it was a mistake for Berkshire to buy NetJets, for which it paid $725 million in 1998. “NetJets is a very decent business,” he said. “We have very professional pilots, and we have at the moment have a difference of opinion about the contract, and that will get settled.” The NetJets pilots’ lawsuit is in Columbus, Ohio, where the company has operations. Berkshire is based in Omaha.

841,BRKa,RPT-Buffett says stock levels now would be high if rates were normal,"OMAHA, Neb., May 2 (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said on Saturday that stock prices would look expensive if interest rates normalized from their ultra low levels. “If we get back to normal interest rates, stocks at these prices will look high,” said Buffett, speaking at the annual Berkshire Hathaway meeting of his sprawling conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway. The U.S. Federal Reserve is currently weighing raising rates from their near-zero levels of the financial crisis era, even as questions remain about the strength of growth in the world’s biggest economy. The current environment of the U.S. economy will not influence potential acquisitions at Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett said. Berkshire tends to hold companies for decades - or forever, as Buffett has said in the past - making the short-term economic outlook less valuable as a predictor of a company’s success than longer-term trends. “Any company that has an economist certainly has one employee too many,” Buffett added. He also said that he expects the U.S. dollar to remain the world’s reserve currency. “I think the dollar will be the world’s reserve currency 50 years from now,” he said.

842,BRKa,RPT-Warren Buffett denies that Berkshire Hathaway 'too big to fail',"(Repeats for wider distribution) By Jonathan Stempel OMAHA, Neb., May 2 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday rejected the idea that Berkshire Hathaway Inc, a sprawling conglomerate he has built over 50 years, has grown so big that it is now too big to fail and requires tighter regulatory oversight. “There is no reason, in logic or in terms of what we’ve heard, to think that Berkshire would be designated as a SIFI,” Buffett said at Berkshire’s annual meeting, using the acronym for systemically important financial institution. “I do not think Berkshire comes within miles of qualifying as a SIFI.” The SIFI designation forces companies to submit to Federal Reserve oversight, and could make them adopt tighter capital and liquidity requirements that could impede growth and profitability. Buffett and his second-in-command, Charlie Munger, were fielding questions at the annual shareholder meeting.  Buffett was responding to a question about how the SIFI designation would affect Berkshire. The focus on Berkshire’s size has grown over the years as Berkshire has amassed more than 80 businesses, including capital-intensive businesses such as the Burlington Northern railroad, and units that insure against major catastrophes. Those catastrophes can be costly, and both the September 11  attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon as well as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 cost Berkshire billions of dollars. Buffett, however, has pledged to maintain a $20 billion cash cushion at Berkshire - it has $63.7 billion now - to protect against such problems. Moreover, Berkshire gained a reputation during the global financial crisis as a source of liquidity, investing in companies as diverse as Goldman Sachs Group Inc, General Electric Co and motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc .

845,BRKa,Warren Buffett makes Berkshire gala an all-consuming affair,"OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Warren Buffett puts on a good show. Especially when he is the show. That show grew bigger as more than 40,000 Berkshire Hathaway shareholders poured into Omaha this weekend to celebrate his 50th anniversary running the company, at what the world’s third-richest person calls Woodstock for Capitalists. Buffett and his chief lieutenant Charlie Munger answered their five hours of shareholder and investor questions at the annual meeting in the downtown CenturyLink arena, from a stage where they downed Coca-Cola and munched on peanut brittle from See’s. But there’s more to do than just attend the main meeting.  Many get together with other shareholders. It’s a time to shop, which Buffett would prefer be done with some of Berkshire’s more than 80 businesses. It’s a time to eat. And for some wanting good seats at the meeting, it’s a time to be sleep-deprived. Really sleep-deprived. Kyle Cleeton, an investment research analyst, said he got to the arena at 10 p.m. Friday night, nine hours before doors opened. “I wanted to be first in line,” he said. Thousands more spent Friday night across town, where Berkshire commandeers a shopping center housing its Borsheim’s jewelry store and pitches a big outdoor tent, band included. Shareholders ate meatballs, sausage, chicken teriyaki, carved roast beef, and cheese cubes - Buffett food, reflecting his taste for the uncomplicated. All free. Many shareholders took photos of management consultant Rick Murray of Birmingham, Michigan, his three chihuahuas in tow in a stomach pouch. “I’ve been a shareholder for 20 years, and this is my first trip,” he said. “I had met a client, and he said, ‘You know, Omaha is not that far from Michigan.’” Saturday began with a mini-parade featuring two Texas longhorn steers, and a stagecoach from Wells Fargo. Inside the arena, Berkshire businesses hawked their wares. The blinding yellow men’s “Berky” boxer shorts from Fruit of the Loom flew off the racks at $6 apiece. Kirby’s pet stain and odor remover, priced at just $5, drew less interest. Meanwhile, Dairy Queen sold out its 26,500 ice cream bars, Mini Blizzards and cake slices. Buffett paid $1 for his 7:15 a.m. ice cream fix, just before joining Microsoft co-founder and Berkshire director Bill Gates in a newspaper tossing contest. That entails shareholders competing to see who can toss copies of Berkshire-owned newspapers closer to a target than Buffett. Winning shareholders get rewarded with Dairy Queen ice cream bars. The meeting was preceded by the annual humorous movie overseen by Buffett’s daughter Susie.  It featured a spoof championship boxing match, directed by John Landis of “Trading Places,” between welterweight champ Floyd Mayweather Jr and “Berkshire Bomber” Buffett, who trained by running an adding machine and once in the ring stuffed his face with See’s candies instead of a mouthpiece.

846,BRKa,"Buffett celebrates 50th year at Berkshire, faces tough questions","OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders on Saturday celebrated Warren Buffett’s 50th anniversary running the conglomerate, as the billionaire expressed optimism the company would thrive over the long haul, even after he is gone. Buffett and his second-in-command, Charlie Munger, fielded five hours of questions from shareholders, analysts and journalists at Berkshire’s annual meeting, including some that criticized the business practices of firms that Berkshire owns or works with, such as Brazil’s 3G Capital. The meeting had a more festive air this year, with one of the more than 40,000 people who attended shouting out “Warren and Charlie, we love you” at the start of the main event of what Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists.” “It’s not Disneyland, it’s Warrenland,” said David Rolfe, chief investment officer of Wedgewood Partners Inc. Berkshire holds more than 80 companies including the Burlington Northern railroad, Geico car insurance, Benjamin Moore paint, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, and See’s candies, and owns more than $115 billion of stocks. Its breadth and depth, which includes $63.7 billion of cash, has given Berkshire a strong balance sheet that Buffett said will help it thrive should the economy, propped up by low interest rates that many expect to rise soon, heads south. “We will be very willing to act if economic turbulence of any kind occurs, and will be prepared, and most people won’t be,” he said. He denied that Berkshire needed special regulatory oversight by possibly having become too big to fail. Buffett gave no hints about who would succeed him. He also alluded in one answer to his writing another of his popular letters to shareholders next February, suggesting no intention to leave soon. Yet he said he would not want someone whose sole background is in investments to become chief executive. “I would not want to put someone in charge of Berkshire with only investing experience and not any operational experience.”  Buffett also offered ringing praise for the turnaround at Burlington Northern, Berkshire’s largest noninsurance unit, which was plagued last year by service delays. “The improvement has been huge, and I want to thank Matt Rose and Carl Ice for their really extraordinary performance,” he said, referring to the railroad’s executive chairman and chief executive. Rose, considered by some a potential Berkshire CEO candidate, was not mentioned by Buffett in his annual letter, which led some to believe his standing had been lowered. Other potential CEO candidates include insurance executive Ajit Jain, whose decision to join Berkshire three decades ago was hailed by Buffett as one of the “luckiest” events he experienced, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy chief Gregory Abel, who talked at the meeting about renewable energy. He was the only person other than Buffett and Munger to field a question. Ken Shubin Stein, founder of Spencer Capital Management LLC in New York, said having a CEO with an operational background “makes sense since the CEO needs to work with the investment team and understand their use of capital for investments, versus using the capital for investing in acquisitions.” As is usually the case, no major controversy has been hanging over Berkshire. But Buffett did get two questions that led him to praise 3G Capital, which critics say ruthlessly cuts jobs at companies it acquires. In 2013, Berkshire and 3G bought H.J. Heinz Co, which is now buying Kraft Foods Group Inc. “The 3G people have been successful in building marvelous businesses,” Buffett said. “I don’t know of any company that has a policy that says we’re going to have a lot more people than they need.” Buffett also defended Berkshire’s Clayton Homes manufactured homes unit, which was criticized in a recent Seattle Times article for predatory sales practices that can trap low-income borrowers in homes they cannot afford.  “I make no apologies whatsoever for Clayton’s lending terms,” he said, adding that Clayton itself faces losses when borrowers default. Buffett also said he expects a contentious contract dispute between Berkshire’s luxury aircraft unit NetJets and its pilots to be resolved, and said he had “no anti-union agenda whatsoever.” Some of the pilots picketed outside the meeting. Addressing a question about Berkshire’s stakes in companies including Coca-Cola Co that sell highly sugared products, Buffett said companies can change as consumer tastes evolve. Alluding to his own well-publicized fondness for junk food, he said: “If I had been eating broccoli and Brussels sprouts all my life, I don’t think I would live as long.” Buffett also said the euro currency “can and probably should survive,” but that “real changes” would probably be required. Munger, for his part, said European leaders created a “flawed system” that was “probably unwise” by letting countries that were too weak adopt the currency.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc  rose 1.62 percent, giving the biggest boost to the S&P; 500 after the insurance and investment conglomerate’s results beat forecasts. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 46.34 points, or 0.26 percent, to end at 18,070.4, and the S&P; 500  gained 6.2 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,114.49, just shy of its record-high close of 2,117.69 on April 24. The Nasdaq Composite added 11.54 points, or 0.23 percent, to 5,016.93. “This is being driven by a lack of substantial negative news,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. “Things in Europe seem pretty calm, we haven’t heard anything out of China, and against that backdrop, some of the earnings reports are looking better.” Cognizant surged 6.15 percent after the IT services provider reported a better-than-expected rise in revenue and raised its full-year forecast. Seven of the 10 S&P; sectors were positive, with the financials index gaining 0.98 percent and the utilities index 0.73 percent higher, with investors attracted by relatively high dividends. With three-quarters of corporate earnings reports in, Wall Street is now trying to divine when the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin raising interest rates. An April payroll report due on Friday could give a hint. While new orders for U.S. factory goods recorded their biggest increase in eight months in March, the underlying trend remained weak against the backdrop of a strong dollar, a further sign that a rebound in economic growth would not be as strong as last year. Monday’s rally in utilities suggested some investors believe the Fed will not raise rates soon and may be looking for yield, Jankovskis said. The S&P; utilities index has a dividend yield of 3.7 percent, compared to the S&P; 500’s 2.4 percent dividend yield. McDonald’s Corp closed 1.71 percent lower after its plan to turn the fast-food chain into a “modern, progressive burger company” failed to impress shareholders. Shares of Pioneer Natural Resources Co fell 1.88 percent and the S&P; 500 energy index lost 1.39 percent after David Einhorn, the influential head of hedge fund Greenlight Capital, said at a conference that oil fracking companies can “contaminate portfolio returns.” Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,758 to 1,287, for a 1.37-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,593 issues rose and 1,158 fell for a 1.38-to-1 ratio favoring advancers. The benchmark S&P; 500 index was posting 14 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 55 new highs and 35 new lows. About 5.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 7.2 billion daily average for the last five sessions, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

850,BRKa,DaVita to pay $450 mln in Medicare fraud lawsuit over wasted drugs,"May 4 (Reuters) - DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc, one of the largest U.S. kidney dialysis providers, said it agreed to pay $450 million to settle a whistleblower lawsuit accusing it of deliberately wasting medicines in order to receive higher Medicare payments. The lawsuit alleged that DaVita, whose largest shareholder is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, used larger-than-necessary medicine vials or unnecessarily spread medicine dosages across multiple treatments, knowing that Medicare would pay for what it considered “unavoidable” waste. An agreement in principle to settle was disclosed in an April 16 filing with the U.S. federal court in Atlanta. DaVita made the terms public on Monday, when it reported a first-quarter loss that reflected a $298 million after-tax charge for the settlement. The Denver-based company set aside $495 million for the accord, including $45 million for legal fees and costs. “Although we believe strongly in the merits of our case, we decided it was in our stakeholders’ best interests to resolve it,” DaVita Chief Legal Officer Kim Rivera said in a statement. “The potential mandatory penalties for being found in the wrong in even a small percentage of instances were simply too large.” The named plaintiffs were Alon Vainer, a nephrologist who has worked in dialysis clinics in Georgia, and Daniel Barbir, a registered nurse from that state. Their lawsuit brought under the federal False Claims Act began in October 2007. It was unsealed in July 2011 after the U.S. Department of Justice decided not to join it, often a sign it believes the case is not strong enough. In separate emails, L. Lin Wood and Marlan Wilbanks, lawyers for the plaintiffs, said their clients were pleased, and that they believed the settlement is a record for a whistleblower case that lacked government support. “Dr. Vainer and Nurse Barbir exhibited great courage and determination” in pursuing the case, whose result “primarily benefits the taxpayers of the United States,” Wood said. DaVita posted a first-quarter loss of $110.6 million, or 52 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $183.3 million, or 85 cents. Excluding the settlement, profit was 86 cents per share, matching analyst forecasts according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue rose 8 percent to $3.29 billion. Berkshire owned 17.9 percent of DaVita as of Dec. 31, Reuters data show. DaVita shares closed down 6 cents at $82.34 in regular trading on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.

Berkshire  rose 1.8 percent, giving the biggest boost to the S&P; 500 after the insurance and investment conglomerate’s results beat forecasts. At 2:20 p.m. the Dow Jones industrial average rose 67.43 points, or 0.37 percent, to 18,091.49, the S&P; 500  gained 8.72 points, or 0.41 percent, to 2,117.01 and the Nasdaq Composite added 18.45 points, or 0.37 percent, to 5,023.84. Eight of the 10 S&P; sectors were positive, with the financials index gaining 0.82 percent and the utilities index 1.1 percent higher. “We just seem to be hanging in an upper range, taking in a rash of earnings and trying to digest if the fundamentals are there to build a platform for us to leg-up from,” said Frank Davis, director of sales and trading at LEK Securities in New York, adding that he is skeptical of current stock prices. With quarterly earnings reports winding down, Wall Street is trying to divine when the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin raising interest rates. An April payroll report due on Friday could give a hint. While new orders for U.S. factory goods recorded their biggest increase in eight months in March, the underlying trend remained weak against the backdrop of a strong dollar, a further sign that a rebound in economic growth would not be as strong as last year. McDonald’s Corp fell 1.01 percent after its plan to turn the fast-food chain into a “modern, progressive burger company” failed to impress shareholders. Shares of Pioneer Natural Resources Co fell 3.1 percent and the S&P; 500 energy index was 1 percent lower after David Einhorn, the influential head of hedge fund Greenlight Capital, said at a conference that oil fracking companies can “contaminate portfolio returns.” Cognizant hit an all-time high of $65.55 after the IT services provider reported a better-than-expected rise in revenue and raised its full-year forecast.

Berkshire  rose 1.8 percent to $145.98 and gave the biggest boost to the S&P; after the insurance and investment conglomerate’s results beat forecasts. Eight of the 10 S&P; sectors were higher, with the finance index gaining 0.7 percent and the health index  up 0.8 percent. The Nasdaq biotech index was up 0.8 percent. The index lost 5.5 percent last week, despite a 2.9 percent rise on Friday. While new orders for U.S. factory goods recorded their biggest increase in eight months in March, the underlying trend remained weak against the backdrop of a strong dollar, a further sign that a rebound in economic growth would not be as strong as last year. Over the past two weeks, the S&P; 500 index has moved an average of 17.79 points daily, wider than the 12.43 point range in early March. The swings have amplified on mixed economic signals. “The main event this week is the April unemployment numbers and that’s going to be the main driver for the markets,” said Mohannad Aama, managing director at Beam Capital Management in New York. Aama reckons that the strong gains in the market in the past few weeks may be erased as a strong jobs number could put a June rate hike back into play. The payroll report is scheduled for Friday.

854,BRKa,Warren Buffett to auction another charity lunch,"(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has once again agreed to have lunch this year with the winner of an auction to benefit a San Francisco charity. The 16th annual auction to benefit Glide, which provides food and services to the poor and homeless, will be held on eBay (EBAY.O) from May 31 to June 5, the charity said on Tuesday. Past auctions have raised about $17.8 million, including a record $3,456,789 from an anonymous bidder in 2012. Last year’s winner, Andy Chua of Singapore, bid $2,166,766. Other winners have included hedge fund manager David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital, and Ted Weschler, now a portfolio manager at Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N). Weschler won two auctions, bidding $2,626,311 in 2010 and $2,626,411 in 2011. As in past years, this year’s winner and up to seven friends will have a private lunch with Buffett at the Smith & Wollensky steakhouse in Manhattan. The auctions began in 2000 after Buffett was introduced to Glide by his first wife, Susan, who died in 2004. Glide was co-founded by the Rev. Cecil Williams, a community leader and longtime pastor at Glide Memorial United Methodist Church in San Francisco’s Tenderloin district.  “Glide helped me understand just how much a life can be transformed by unconditional love and some real material help,” Buffett said in a statement provided by Glide. Buffett is worth about $71.8 billion, ranking third worldwide, Forbes magazine said on Tuesday. He has run Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire for 50 years.

855,BRKa,UPDATE 3-U.S. FAA in partnerships to test beyond-line-of-sight drones,"(Adds details on PrecisionHawk) By David Morgan WASHINGTON, May 6 (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration said it would work with two private U.S. companies to test commercial drones that can fly beyond an operator’s line of sight, a precursor to sophisticated drone operations such as package delivery. The separate partnerships, with drone maker PrecisionHawk and BNSF Railway Co, a railroad operator owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, are a potential milestone in developing unmanned aircraft for a variety of business applications. The U.S. aviation regulator also announced on Wednesday a partnership with cable television news network CNN to test news gathering in urban areas that have been largely off limits for commercial drones. The FAA has been under intense pressure from industry and Congress to allow beyond-line-of-sight operations. It has heard from companies ranging from Amazon.com Inc and Google Inc, which are developing drones that can deliver packages, to energy and agriculture firms that want to use the devices for inspecting crops or pipelines. Reuters first reported last week that the FAA is in talks with drone manufacturers and operators about testing beyond-line-of-sight drone systems, and an announcement is expected as soon as this week. “We anticipate receiving valuable data from each of these trials that could result in FAA-approved operations in the next few years,” said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta, who announced the partnerships at a drone industry convention in Atlanta. “Integrating unmanned aircraft into our airspace is a big job, and it’s one the FAA is determined to get right,” he said in comments released by the agency in Washington. The agency proposed rules in February that would lift a near-ban on companies using drones as part of their business operations. The FAA has also been granting permission for commercial drone use on a case-by-case basis since last September. In both cases, regulators have insisted that drones fly within an operator’s line of sight for safety reasons - restrictions that would not allow for advanced operations such as package delivery services championed by Amazon. Beyond-line-of-sight operations use on-board cameras to enable an operator to change course to avoid aircraft and other obstacles. The partnerships with industry could raise the odds that beyond-line-of-sight technology will ultimately be accepted by new commercial drone regulations that the FAA is working to finalize within the next two years. Under its FAA partnership, Raleigh, North Carolina-based PrecisionHawk will test its low-altitude tracking and avoidance system for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) on farmlands. PrecisionHawk said it would provide the FAA with data to help the agency develop regulations around UAS. The company’s UAS framework accommodates various fixed-wing and multi-rotor drones for agriculture, forestry and other rural industries.

The changes were disclosed in a regulatory filing detailing Berkshire’s U.S.-listed stock portfolio as of March 31. Berkshire also boosted its share stake in U.S. Bancorp, another large holding, while other portfolio managers adjusted their stakes in several companies.

859,BRKa,Fitch Affirms Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s Ratings at 'AA-/AA+',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'AA-' Issuer Default  Rating of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) and the 'AA+' Insurer Financial  Strength Ratings on BRK's key insurance subsidiaries.  The Rating Outlook is  Stable.  A complete list of ratings and rating actions is shown at the end of  this release.    KEY RATING DRIVERS: Fitch's ratings for BRK are supported by extremely strong capitalization and  market position of its insurance subsidiaries, solid operating performance with  good diversification across business lines, and excellent financial flexibility  and liquidity.   Also considered in the ratings are material equity market risk, insured natural  catastrophe exposures, growing exposure to asbestos and environmental risk and  various issues associated with the company's acquisition strategy.   BRK's 'Large' market position in the property/casualty insurance sector, with  annual premiums in excess of $42 billion and combined statutory surplus of  approximately $130 billion are consistent with Fitch's 'AA' IFS rating category. The capitalization of BRK's insurance operations is considered 'Extremely  Strong' measured by Fitch's Prism capital model and is heavily weighted in the  company's current rating. BRK's consolidated financial leverage ratio was 25.6% as of March 31, 2015. This  ratio includes nearly $57 billion of debt attributable to BRK's Railroad,  Utilities and Energy business. Fitch expects these major non-insurance  businesses will service their own debt.  An alternate calculation of BRK's financial leverage ratio, using holding  company debt and debt issued by the finance operations and guaranteed by BRK,  was 14.9% at March 31, 2015. The agency views BRK's ability to fund finance  operations at a low cost as an important competitive advantage for the finance  operations and also notes that much of the finance company debt is guaranteed by  BRK. Consolidated interest coverage for the first quarter of 2015 (1Q15) was 8.1x  excluding realized investment gains, which is below Fitch's expectations of 12x  for companies at BRK's rating level. An alternate calculation of interest  coverage, excluding railroad, utilities and energy, was 17.2x during the first  three months of 2015 and is consistent with the current rating category.  BRK reported net income of $5.2 billion for the first three months of 2015, up  from $4.7 billion in the comparable period of 2014.  BRK's insurance group  reported $1.8 billion in earnings before tax in 1Q15, accounting for nearly 30%  of BRK's $6.3 billion in pre-tax earnings allocated to operating segments.   Burlington Northern and Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad operation continues to make  significant contributions to earnings.  BNSF reported a pretax gain of $1.7  billion for the first three months of 2015, up materially from $1.2 billion in  the comparable period in 2014. BNSF's profitability will likely be squeezed as  the company plans to spend $6 billion or more than one-quarter of estimated  revenues on plant and equipment during 2015.  BRK's annualized return on equity was 8.6% for 1Q15, excluding unrealized gains  on fixed income securities, which was level with the full-year 2014 results.   BRK's GAAP basis earnings will continue to be exposed to earnings volatility  given the large notional values and long duration of BRK's outstanding  derivative contracts. Additionally, Fitch believes that BRK's earnings will be  exposed to potential volatility from the company's reinsurance businesses and  its exposure to catastrophe-related losses as well as the company's large equity  investment portfolio. BRK has grown its asbestos & environmental insured liability exposure over the  past several years to $14.4 billion as of Dec. 31, 2014.  Most of this  liability, $12.7 billion, was added through retroactive reinsurance contracts,  most notably with Equitas Limited, Swiss Re, CNA Financial Corp, AIG and Liberty  Mutual. In 2014, a reserve strengthening in retroactive reinsurance policies  generated an underwriting loss of $905 million, worsening from a $321 million  loss in 2013. RATING SENSITIVITIES: Key rating triggers that could lead to a future downgrade include: --Deterioration in the credit quality of key insurance subsidiaries (National  Indemnity, GenRe, and GEICO) that is no longer consistent with the current 'AA+'  rating.  Measures of credit quality include Fitch's judgment of capitalization,  a total financing and commitments ratio greater than 1.5x, net leverage  (excluding affiliated investments) over 3.5x or a sharp and persistent reduction  in underwriting profits.   --A consolidated run-rate debt-to-total capital ratio that exceeds 30% or a  run-rate debt-to-total capital ratio from the holding company, insurance and  finance operations (including debt issued or guaranteed by the holding company)  that exceeds 25%. --Material increases in leveraged equity market exposure such as its in its  equity index put derivative portfolio.    --Acquisitions or other actions that reduce outstanding cash below $10 billion  or approximately 5x consolidated interest expense.      Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: A commitment to lower debt-to-tangible capital ratios attributed to the holding  company, insurance, and finance operations.  Fitch believes that this would  likely require the scaling back of the finance operations.

860,BRKa,UPDATE 2-BNSF drops plan to buy tank cars on customer concerns,"(Adds quotes about brakes mandate affecting capacity) By Kristen Hays HOUSTON, May 15 (Reuters) - BNSF Railway Co this week told customers it had dropped a plan announced last year to buy 5,000 stronger crude oil tank cars after customers were concerned about the company moving into railcar ownership. The letter from the company, owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, went out a week and a half after the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) unveiled new standards for rail cars that carry crude and ethanol, along with new operational rules. “We do have concerns that additional provisions of the DOT rule will remove capacity from our network, particularly the electronically controlled pneumatic brakes mandate,” the company said. BNSF spokeswoman Roxanne Butler confirmed the information in the company letter to customers. Three BNSF crude trains that have crashed or derailed and caught fire since late 2013 - the latest just last week - are part of a spate of such fiery accidents that focused attention on safety. Under the new rules, all new cars built after Oct. 1 this year must have 9/16-inch hulls - thicker than the industry standard of 7/16-inches adopted in 2011 - and other reinforcements to protect against punctures and leaks in a derailment. The 7/16-inch cars can be retrofitted with protections for top and bottom fittings, steel shields on the front and back and “jackets,” or an extra layer of steel around the hull, on a staggered schedule depending on how strong they are now. The industry largely expected rules for thicker steel and other reinforcements, but the brake issue has prompted opposition. The American Petroleum Institute is challenging that provision. {ID:nL1N0Y403E] In its letter, BNSF advised customers who buy new rail cars to include structures that allow enhanced brakes to be added at a later date “while the industry continues to work through these issues.” BNSF in February last year asked railcar manufacturers to submit proposals to build a stronger car than the 2011 standard, just three months after a BNSF crude train hit a derailed grain railcar in North Dakota, causing a fire that lasted several days. The move was unusual, as railroads generally own just the tracks and locomotives, while shippers or railcar leasing companies own the cars. But BNSF’s letter said that in later conversations with shippers, “BNSF owning or leasing tank cars was not viewed as useful,” so the company scrapped the idea.

867,BRKa,Warren Buffett charity lunch already fetching $1 mln at auction,"June 1 (Reuters) - An online auction for the right to dine with billionaire investor Warren Buffett and raise money for a San Francisco charity has started strongly, with the top bid surpassing $1 million in less than a day. Buffett has raised $17.8 million in 15 prior annual auctions for Glide, a charity in San Francisco’s Tenderloin district that provides food, health care, rehabilitation and other services for the poor and homeless. As of 2:30 p.m. EDT (1830 GMT) Monday, the top bid was $1,000,100 in the eBay auction, which ends at 10:30 p.m. EDT Friday (0230 GMT Saturday). That bid matches the seventh-highest amount ever paid, which occurred in 2013, and may go higher because bids often soar in the last hour. The auction began Sunday night, with a $25,000 minimum bid. “We’re very happy, very happy,” the Rev. Cecil Williams, the co-founder of Glide, said in a phone interview. “We expect the bidding to take off, but $1 million coming this early is somewhat surprising.” This year’s winner can bring up to seven friends to dine with Buffett at the Smith & Wollensky steakhouse in Manhattan. Some past winners chose to dine at a steakhouse in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett runs Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Last year’s winner, Andy Chua of Singapore, bid $2,166,766. The record bid, in 2012, was $3,456,789, submitted anonymously. One winner, Ted Weschler, ended up working for Buffett as a Berkshire portfolio manager after paying a combined $5.25 million to win the 2010 and 2011 auctions. The auctions began in 2000 after Buffett was introduced to Glide by his first wife, Susan, who died in 2004. “Nobody who’s donated to Glide has ever felt short-changed,” Buffett said in a statement last month. Williams, a community leader and pastor at Glide Memorial United Methodist Church, said he visited Buffett two weeks ago in Omaha to discuss Glide’s work. “We want to empower our people and find resources to help us pull this off, and touch the lives of people who are hurting most,” Williams said. Buffett’s involvement helps, he added. “When Buffett speaks, people listen,” Williams said. “He is a man of deep conviction.” Buffett is worth about $70.4 billion, making him the world’s fourth richest person, Forbes magazine said on Monday.

874,BRKa,Fitch Publishes Report on Berkshire Hathaway's Recent Growth in Commercial Lines Insurance,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 18 (Fitch) In a new special report, Fitch Ratings reviews the  recent meaningful expansion by Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (BRK) into the U.S.  commercial lines insurance market. BRK is well known as one of the largest  property/casualty insurers in the U.S. with operating franchises in reinsurance  written through National Indemnity Company and General Reinsurance Corporation,  and private passenger automobile insurance written through GEICO Corporation. BRK has also quietly expanded to become the 10th largest U.S. commercial lines  insurer based on 2014 direct premium volume. Fitch's report explores the source  of BRK's premium growth, recent underwriting experience of new business, and the  sustainability and credit implications of this growth. Business expansion over the past five years has been significant with commercial  lines direct premium expanding by 125% to $5.6 billion through organic growth  and targeted acquisitions. Workers compensation insurance has been a key driver  of this growth and BRK is now the seventh largest U.S. writer based on 2014  direct written premiums. BRK's commercial lines operations include several separate and distinct  underwriting platforms. The Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies segment  experienced the most significant recent growth, evolving from a regional  organization that offers various coverages to smaller businesses into a  nationwide organization that wrote over $1 billion in direct premiums in 2014. Diverse commercial business segments and substantial capital resources position  BRK for further market share growth that could marginalize smaller commercial  lines underwriters that have less favorable market position. The 2013 formation  of Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (BHSI) created a vehicle for further  commercial lines expansion adding underwriting capability in a number of product  lines, including: excess and surplus (E&S;) lines, commercial property and  professional liability insurance. BRK's commercial lines' underwriting results have consistently outperformed the  property/casualty industry and most peers and loss reserve experience is  historically favorable. Maintaining underwriting profitability with a greatly  expanded premium base in a competitive market environment may provide future  challenges. Contact: James B.

879,BRKa,"News Corp must face Dial, Heinz ad monopoly class action - judge","(Reuters) - News Corp (NWSA.O) has been ordered by a Manhattan federal judge to face a class action lawsuit accusing it of monopolizing the market for in-store promotions at some 52,500 retail stores across the United States. U.S. District Judge William Pauley said consumer packaged goods companies such as Dial Corp, H.J. Heinz Co [HJHC.UL] and Smithfield Foods Inc [SFII.UL] may pursue their antitrust claims as a group, potentially boosting overall damages. News Corp spokeswoman Laura Adams said the company, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, is reviewing Thursday’s decision. The litigation is part of a long-running battle over News Corp’s marketing operations. In January 2010, the New York-based company agreed to pay $500 million to end rival Valassis Communications Inc’s [VCII.UL] antitrust lawsuit over the newspaper coupon market. News Corp has an estimated 80 percent of the U.S. market for in-store promotion services, where it acts as a middleman to help companies promote goods through coupon dispensers, electronic signs, end-of-aisle displays and shopping cart ads. The plaintiffs said News Corp has monopolized this market since 2004 by locking up exclusive long-term contracts with retailers. They said this anticompetitive conduct has forced them to pay artificially high prices to promote such goods as Dial-brand soap, Heinz ketchup and Smithfield’s Eckrich hot dogs. In certifying a class action from April 5, 2008, to the present, Pauley rejected News Corp’s arguments that damages would be too hard to measure. He noted that the plaintiffs’ damages expert estimated overcharges of 31 percent to 43 percent in the 2008-13 period. The judge also said “central questions regarding liability” for alleged supra-competitive prices were “susceptible to common proof” that could be addressed in a single trial.

880,BRKa,"News Corp must face Dial, Heinz ad monopoly class action - judge","(Reuters) - News Corp has been ordered by a Manhattan federal judge to face a class action lawsuit accusing it of monopolizing the market for in-store promotions at some 52,500 retail stores across the United States. U.S. District Judge William Pauley said consumer packaged goods companies such as Dial Corp, H.J. Heinz Co and Smithfield Foods Inc may pursue their antitrust claims as a group, potentially boosting overall damages. News Corp spokeswoman Laura Adams said the company, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, is reviewing Thursday’s decision. The litigation is part of a long-running battle over News Corp’s marketing operations. In January 2010, the New York-based company agreed to pay $500 million to end rival Valassis Communications Inc’s  antitrust lawsuit over the newspaper coupon market. News Corp has an estimated 80 percent of the U.S. market for in-store promotion services, where it acts as a middleman to help companies promote goods through coupon dispensers, electronic signs, end-of-aisle displays and shopping cart ads. The plaintiffs said News Corp has monopolized this market since 2004 by locking up exclusive long-term contracts with retailers. They said this anticompetitive conduct has forced them to pay artificially high prices to promote such goods as Dial-brand soap, Heinz ketchup and Smithfield’s Eckrich hot dogs. In certifying a class action from April 5, 2008, to the present, Pauley rejected News Corp’s arguments that damages would be too hard to measure. He noted that the plaintiffs’ damages expert estimated overcharges of 31 percent to 43 percent in the 2008-13 period. The judge also said “central questions regarding liability” for alleged supra-competitive prices were “susceptible to common proof” that could be addressed in a single trial.

889,BRKa,Ex-Goldman director fails to void insider trading conviction,"(Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc director Rajat Gupta failed to persuade a U.S. judge to overturn his insider trading conviction for passing tips about the bank’s financial results and a crucial investment from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan on Thursday rejected Gupta’s argument that his tips to Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam were not illegal because his longtime friend gave him nothing valuable in return. Gupta, 66, who is also a former McKinsey & Co global managing director, is serving a two-year prison term, and eligible for release next March. Evidence against him included a Sept. 23, 2008 phone call during the financial crisis, minutes before Goldman announced a $5 billion investment from Berkshire, in which Rajaratnam told a trader that “something good might happen to Goldman,” based on a source whom prosecutors said was Gupta. Gary Naftalis, a lawyer for Gupta, was not immediately available for comment. In seeking to void his conviction, Gupta cited a Dec. 10 ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that overturned the insider trading convictions of hedge fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson. That court said insider trading required knowledge that insiders who passed confidential tips did so in exchange for personal benefits “of some consequence.” It also said that if close friends are involved, there must be evidence of an exchange that is “objective, consequential, and represents at least a potential gain of a pecuniary or similarly valuable nature.” Rakoff concluded that the Newman ruling addresses the liability of tippees like Rajaratnam, not tippers like Gupta. And even if it did cover tippers, Rakoff said the necessary benefit existed because Gupta and Voyager Capital Partners Ltd, in which Gupta held a $10 million stake, invested in Galleon and stood to benefit if Rajaratnam traded successfully. “It is thus clear even on Gupta’s own reading of Newman, let alone on the reading this court gives it, that Gupta cannot satisfy any part of his claim,” Rakoff wrote. Rajaratnam also invoked the Newman ruling in trying to throw out a $92.8 million penalty in a related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil case. He is also trying to void part of his conviction and shorten his 11-year prison term. The U.S. Department of Justice is weighing whether to appeal the Newman ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court.

893,BRKa,"UPDATE 1-Buffett donates record $2.84 bln to Gates, family charities","(Adds details about donations, Buffett stake) By Jonathan Stempel July 6 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Monday donated about $2.84 billion of Berkshire Hathaway Inc stock to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and four family charities, as part of the billionaire’s plan to give away nearly all of his wealth. The 10th annual donation, Buffett’s largest, comprised 20.64 million Class “B” shares of Berkshire, and increased Buffett’s total contributions to the charities to more than $21.5 billion. The Gates Foundation, which focuses on improving education and health and reducing poverty, received about 15.76 million shares, or 76 percent of the total donated. Also receiving donations were the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for Buffett’s late first wife, and the Howard G. Buffett, Sherwood and NoVo Foundations, respectively overseen by his children Howard, Susan and Peter. Buffett, 84, still owns 18.8 percent of Berkshire’s stock. Forbes magazine on Monday estimated that would give him a net worth exceeding $64 billion, ranking fourth worldwide. Bill Gates, the Microsoft Corp co-founder, ranked first, at $78.7 billion, Forbes said after U.S. markets closed. Gates is also a Berkshire director, and a close friend and bridge partner of Buffett’s. Most of Buffett’s holdings are in Class “A” stock, which gives him 32.9 percent of Berkshire’s voting power. Buffett typically makes his donations in July, reducing the number of shares by 5 percent from the prior year. (here)  Dollar amounts often rise because of increases in Berkshire's stock price.

896,BRKa,U.S. fines Berkshire's Forest River RV unit for delaying recalls,"(Reuters) - A U.S. regulator on Thursday fined Forest River Inc, the recreational vehicle unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, $5 million for waiting too long to conduct two recalls of camper trailers whose safety defects left them at risk of fire. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Forest River admitted to violating federal vehicle safety laws by mishandling the recalls of 726 Rockwood and Flagstaff camper trailers and 200 Palomino camper trailers, all of which were made in 2014, and being slow to submit required reports. Forest River could owe $30 million of additional fines if safety problems persist, according to a consent order. The Rockwood and Flagstaff vehicles contained loose wiring that could spark fires upon contact with heating elements, while the Palomino vehicles lacked an exhaust and fresh air intake vent, raising the risk of fire or carbon monoxide exposure. Forest River had told owners about the problems in service bulletins, but did not recall the vehicles until ordered by the NHTSA, the regulator said. As part of its settlement, Forest River will hire an independent monitor to oversee its safety practices, hire an in-house consultant to oversee compliance with the consent order, and adopt a set of “best practices” for the RV industry. In a related announcement, the NHTSA fined Spartan Motors Inc, a maker of vehicle chassis and emergency response vehicles, $1 million for being too slow to announce recalls and failing to properly report service bulletins. Spartan will spend another $3 million to ensure compliance. “Today’s action sends a message to these manufacturers and to others that withholding critical safety information is not an option,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said. Forest River, which is based in Elkhart, Indiana, said it has implemented “corrective measures” since learning of the problems, and looks forward to working further with the NHTSA. The company generate $3.8 billion of revenue in 2014. Daryl Adams, Spartan’s chief executive, said the Charlotte, Michigan-based company has not received reports of crashes, fires or injuries associated with the matter. “We regret that the company’s historic performance did not meet NHTSA expectations,” he said.

898,BRKa,Statoil says crude on derailed BNSF train complied with volatility limit,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - The North Dakota crude on a Berkshire Hathaway Inc-owned (BRKa.N) BNSF Railway Co train that derailed this week in Montana was produced by Norway’s Statoil STL.OL and complied with regulations that limit flammability, a Statoil spokesman said on Friday. The train was bound for BP Plc’s (BP.L) refinery in Washington state, sources familiar with the shipment said. Twenty-two of 106 railcars loaded with crude derailed on the westbound train Thursday evening east of Culbertson, Montana. Statoil spokesman Peter Symons said the crude was “fully compliant” with North Dakota regulations imposed in April that limit vapor pressure in crude before it is loaded into railcars for transport to market. The state has used vapor pressure as a proxy for measuring the amount of flammable natural gas liquids that are present in crude that can ignite in a crash. BNSF spokesman Michael Trevino said late Friday that five railcars leaked 35,000 gallons of oil, or about 1,100 barrels. There was no fire. He said repairs to the track were under way and BNSF expected to re-open it to traffic late Friday or early Saturday. He also said the railcars were of the latest design adopted by the industry in October 2011, known as CPC-1232s, and not older, less fortified DOT-111s. The U.S. Department of Transportation said late Friday that the train was loaded with crude by Savage Services in Trenton, North Dakota, and that about 35,000 gallons, or 1,100 barrels, of oil leaked. Companies like Savage take samples of crude slated for rail transport and test it to ensure it meets North Dakota’s limit of 13.7 psi. Symons said Statoil’s shipment met that threshold. North Dakota imposed the vapor pressure rule to lessen likelihood of a fire or explosion in a derailment after a spate of fiery crashes. DOT in May issued new rules for more fortified railcars carrying crude and ethanol for the same reason. New railcars built from October this year on must have thicker hulls and more reinforcements than CPC-1232s, but thousands of CPC-1232 cars on the rails have several years to undergo retrofits to meet the new standards.

902,BRKa,UPDATE 1-China's Fosun bids to buy rest of BHF Kleinwort Benson,"(Adds details on valuation) BRUSSELS, July 24 (Reuters) - Chinese investment group Fosun  made a takeover bid for  wealth management group BHF Kleinwort Benson, the Belgian stock market regulator said on Friday, in a deal that would value the group at 675 million euros ($738.5 million). Fosun, already BHF Kleinwort Benson’s largest shareholder with a 28.6 percent stake, is offering 5.1 euros per share, the regulator added. BHF Kleinwort Benson’s shares were suspended earlier on Friday at 4.66 euros. Like Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Fosun is seeking to buy insurance assets to help it finance future investments. It agreed to buy German bank Hauck & Aufhaeuser Privatbankiers earlier in July. It also owns French-based holiday company Club Mediterranee and has a stake in Britain’s Thomas Cook. Fosun had said earlier that its investment in BHF Kleinwort Benson would “strengthen its comprehensive financial capabilities and to better access other business opportunities in Europe.” BHF Kleinwort Benson, previously known as RHJ International, used to have large holdings in Japanese firms and also bid in 2009 to buy carmaker Opel. However, it began a transformation towards becoming a financial services group after the purchase of Kleinwort Benson from Germany’s Commerzbank in 2009. In 2012 it purchased BHF from Deutsche Bank to become BHF Kleinwort Benson.

903,BRKa,"Berkshire profit falls 37 percent on investment, insurance slump","(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) said on Friday its second-quarter profit fell 37 percent, reflecting a significant decline in investment gains and an underwriting loss from insurance operations, which include Geico. Net income for the Omaha, Nebraska-based insurance and investment company fell to $4.01 billion, or $2,442 per Class A share, from $6.4 billion, or $3,889 per share, a year earlier. Operating profit dropped well below analysts’ forecasts, declining 10 percent to $3.89 billion, or $2,367 per share, from $4.33 billion, or $2,634 per share, despite improvements at the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy units. Analysts on average expected operating profit of about $3,038 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 3 percent to $51.37 billion. Book value per share, Buffett’s preferred measure of growth, rose 2 percent from the end of March to $149,735. Net investment and derivative gains plummeted 94 percent to $123 million from $2.06 billion a year earlier, when Berkshire shed its 40-year stake in former Washington Post publisher Graham Holdings Co (GHC.N). The most recent quarter included losses on contracts betting on long-term gains in major stock market indexes. Accounting rules require Berkshire to report investment and derivative gains and losses with earnings. Buffett considers the amounts in any given quarter irrelevant, and not reflective of Berkshire’s business performance. Earnings from insurance, Berkshire’s best-known operating sector, fell 39 percent to $939 million, and included a $38 million underwriting loss versus a year-earlier $411 million profit. Much of that weakness stemmed from the Geico car insurance unit. Its pretax underwriting gain fell 87 percent to $53 million, as it paid out more of the premiums it collected to cover losses from accidents. Berkshire is boosting premium rates as a result. Meanwhile, a Berkshire business that insures against major catastrophes suffered a $411 million pretax underwriting loss, reflecting currency fluctuations and a storm loss in Australia. Berkshire has been paring back in some insurance areas, particularly reinsurance, as new investors enter the industry, reducing the premiums that Berkshire can charge. “Everyone is chasing the business,” said Jeff Matthews, a principal at the hedge fund Ram Partners. “Outside of insurance,” he added, “things look fine.” Profit from BNSF rose 5 percent to $963 million as improved operating performance offset lower demand to ship petroleum products, reflecting lower crude oil prices, and fertilizer. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility mostly owned by Berkshire, saw profit rise 34 percent to $502 million, helped by higher retail rates and a lower income tax rate. Berkshire has more than 80 operating businesses in such sectors as insurance, energy, food, industrial products and railroads.

904,BRKa,"UPDATE 3-Berkshire profit falls 37 pct on investment, insurance slump","(Adds details on investments, paragraph 18; adds second byline) By Jonathan Stempel and Jennifer Ablan Aug 7 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc   said on Friday its second-quarter profit fell 37 percent, reflecting a significant decline in investment gains and an underwriting loss from insurance operations, which include Geico. Net income for the Omaha, Nebraska-based insurance and investment company fell to $4.01 billion, or $2,442 per Class A share, from $6.4 billion, or $3,889 per share, a year earlier. Operating profit dropped well below analysts’ forecasts, declining 10 percent to $3.89 billion, or $2,367 per share, from $4.33 billion, or $2,634 per share, despite improvements at the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy units. Analysts on average expected operating profit of about $3,038 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 3 percent to $51.37 billion. Book value per share, Buffett’s preferred measure of growth, rose 2 percent from the end of March to $149,735. Net investment and derivative gains plummeted 94 percent to $123 million from $2.06 billion a year earlier, when Berkshire shed its 40-year stake in former Washington Post publisher Graham Holdings Co. The most recent quarter included losses on contracts betting on long-term gains in major stock market indexes. Accounting rules require Berkshire to report investment and derivative gains and losses with earnings. Buffett considers the amounts in any given quarter irrelevant, and not reflective of Berkshire’s business performance. Earnings from insurance, Berkshire’s best-known operating sector, fell 39 percent to $939 million, and included a $38 million underwriting loss versus a year-earlier $411 million profit. Much of that weakness stemmed from the Geico car insurance unit. Its pretax underwriting gain fell 87 percent to $53 million, as it paid out more of the premiums it collected to cover losses from accidents. Berkshire is boosting premium rates as a result. Meanwhile, a Berkshire business that insures against major catastrophes suffered a $411 million pretax underwriting loss, reflecting currency fluctuations and a storm loss in Australia. Berkshire has been paring back in some insurance areas, particularly reinsurance, as new investors enter the industry, reducing the premiums that Berkshire can charge. “Everyone is chasing the business,” said Jeff Matthews, a principal at the hedge fund Ram Partners. “Outside of insurance,” he added, “things look fine.” Profit from BNSF rose 5 percent to $963 million as improved operating performance offset lower demand to ship petroleum products, reflecting lower crude oil prices, and fertilizer. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility mostly owned by Berkshire, saw profit rise 34 percent to $502 million, helped by higher retail rates and a lower income tax rate. Berkshire has more than 80 operating businesses in such sectors as insurance, energy, food, industrial products and railroads. As of June 30 it also owned $117.7 billion of stocks such as Wells Fargo & Co and Coca-Cola Co. It bought $3.09 billion of equities in the quarter, without identifying the companies. The company estimated it will take a $7 billion non-cash pretax gain in the third quarter related to its 26.9 percent stake in Kraft Heinz Co.

907,BRKa,Buffett's Berkshire nears deal for Precision Castparts: source,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) is nearing an agreement to buy Precision Castparts Corp PCP.N, in what could be the company’s largest purchase ever, according to a person familiar with the matter. The purchase of Precision Castparts, which makes aircraft components and energy-production equipment, could be announced as soon as next week and cost more than $30 billion, assuming typical premiums for mergers, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news. Precision Castparts’ market value was $26.7 billion on Friday. Neither Berkshire nor Precision Castparts returned calls and emails seeking comment. Berkshire is one of Precision Castparts’ largest shareholders, with a roughly 3 percent stake worth $882 million as of March 31, according to securities filings. Though it began building that stake in 2012, it remains among the smaller investments in Berkshire’s portfolio. Such investments are normally picked by Buffett’s investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. The addition of Precision Castparts would extend Buffett’s decade-long push into the industrial sector, where he has bought such companies as parts maker Marmon, Israeli toolmaker Iscar, and specialty chemicals company Lubrizol. He considers those companies among his “Powerhouse Five” collection of non-insurance businesses that contribute greatly to Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire’s bottom line. Precision Castparts makes components such as nuts, bolts and other fasteners for aerospace companies such as Airbus Group SE (AIR.PA) and Boeing Co (BA.N), an industry that accounts for roughly 70 percent of sales. It also makes products such as pipes and fittings for power and industrial companies. The company reported a profit of $1.53 billion on net sales of $10 billion for its fiscal year ended March 29. But it has struggled with slack demand in some businesses, and last month missed analysts’ quarterly profit forecasts as Chief Executive Officer Mark Donegan lamented a “challenging” oil and gas environment. Precision Castparts shares have fallen 29 percent since June 2014, and have lagged the Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX by close to 30 percentage points over the last five years. Berkshire shares have also lagged that index over five years, but by a smaller percentage. A purchase would likely let Berkshire deploy much of its $66.59 billion of cash, while still leaving the $20 billion cushion Buffett wants. Berkshire’s biggest purchase is the $26.5 billion takeover in 2010 of the 77.4 percent of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad it did not already own. It has more than 80 operating businesses.

911,BRKa,Buffett pays high price for Precision Castparts,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett is paying a hefty price for the biggest bet of his career as his Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) has agreed to buy Precision Castparts Corp PCP.N, valuing the maker of aerospace and other parts at $32.3 billion. The purchase is Berkshire’s largest, and accelerates its transformation from a company largely dependent on insurance businesses into one resembling the broader U.S. economy, including a railroad, several industrial companies, utilities, a car dealership and consumer goods businesses. It also joins several recent Buffett forays into unglamorous sectors, including a big stake Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and the pending takeover of the Duracell battery business from Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N). Berkshire has said it owned 3 percent of Precision Castparts prior to Monday’s takeover. Precision Castparts earned $1.53 billion in its latest fiscal year. “I’m not crazy about paying $30 billion for a $1.5 billion earnings stream of a cyclical company supplying airplane makers,” said Jeff Matthews, a principal at hedge fund Ram Partners and author of a book about Buffett. “I’d keep the $30 billion and wait for the next crisis.” Known for buying undervalued and often unloved companies, Buffett acknowledged paying a steep price for Precision Castparts, which has been hurt by falling oil and gas prices. “This is a very high multiple for us to pay,” he told CNBC television. Berkshire is paying $235 per share for Precision Castparts, which represents a 21.2 percent premium over Friday’s closing price, and 17.5 times projected 12-month profit. It valued Precision Castparts at $37.2 billion including debt. The merger eclipses Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire’s $26.5 billion purchase in 2010 of the 77.4 percent of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad that it did not already own. In afternoon trading, Precision Castparts shares rose $37.13, or 19.2 percent, to $231.01. Berkshire’s Class A shares fell $522.76, or 0.2 percent, to $214,940. The latest purchase shows how hard it is to move the needle at Berkshire, whose own stock has lagged the Standard & Poor’s 500 in the last five years and which on Friday posted quarterly operating profit well below analyst forecasts. Adding Precision Castparts would boost Berkshire’s overall operating profit by less than 10 percent. It would also give Berkshire ownership of 10 companies that standing alone could be part of the Fortune 500, plus 26.9 percent of Kraft Heinz. Todd Combs, one of Buffett’s investment managers, had begun buying Precision Castparts shares in 2012. “You’ve got to give credit to Todd Combs for this deal,” said Buffett, who turns 85 on August 30. Buffett has run Berkshire since 1965. Precision Castparts generates 70 percent of sales by making nuts, bolts and other fittings for the aerospace industry, where booming commercial aircraft demand has led Airbus Group SE (AIR.PA) and Boeing Co (BA.N) to boost production. But the Portland, Oregon-based company also makes parts for the energy industry, which has struggled as oil prices LCOc1 CLc1 have fallen by more than half over the last year. Prior to Monday, Precision Castparts’ shares had fallen 20 percent in 2015, and the purchase price is below the shares’ 52-week high of $249.05 set last September. Even so, analysts said Berkshire is paying more than 12 times trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That’s above the 9 multiple for BNSF, which now generates more than one-fifth of Berkshire’s operating profit. “At the time of his Burlington Northern deal, everyone criticized he paid too high a price,” said Ken Shubin Stein, founder of Spencer Capital Management in New York. Precision Castparts would become a unit of Berkshire, keeping its name and management as well as its headquarters. “We see a unique alignment between Warren’s management and investment philosophy and how we manage PCC for the long term,” Chief Executive Mark Donegan said in a statement. Andrew Carolus, managing director at Mesirow Financial Investment Banking in Chicago, said Buffett is “obviously a believer” in Precision Castparts’ prospects “over the next five to six decades.” Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at New Albion Partners in New York, added that having access to Berkshire’s balance sheet could help Precision Castparts do more dealmaking, “which the management has proven they’re good at.” Other industrial companies that Buffett has bought in the last decade include toolmaker Iscar, parts maker Marmon, and specialty chemicals company Lubrizol. Buffett said Berkshire would spend $23 billion of cash to finance the Precision Castparts purchase, and borrow the rest. While that would leave Berkshire with more than $40 billion of cash, twice the cushion Buffett wants, Buffett said it would be at least a year before he could pursue another “elephant” sized transaction. Kraft Heinz has proven among his most successful. Buffett has in two years transformed what he has called a $9.5 billion investment in the former H.J. Heinz Co into a Kraft Heinz stake worth roughly $25.5 billion. The Castparts merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. Credit Suisse and the law firms Cravath, Swaine & Moore and Stoel Rives advised Precision Castparts. The law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson advised Berkshire.

912,BRKa,Buffett bets Precision can deliver long-term as aircraft sales grow,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s $32.3 billion deal for Precision Castparts Corp PCP.N shows his willingness to overlook repeated operational stumbles at the company to place a long-term bet on the growth of global air travel. Buffett usually seeks out companies with strong leadership and earnings metrics. But Precision, a maker of aerospace and other parts, has posted lackluster results for the past year, most recently in late July when it reported an 18 percent decline in net income for its fiscal first quarter. The company blamed higher-than-expected costs to ramp up to meet demand from aircraft makers.   Shares in the company were down nearly 20 percent this year until the Berkshire bid became public, and the company had a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 14.44, according to Thomson Reuters data, its lowest P/E ratio since July 2010.  Precision’s sales to the oil and power sector - while less than a fifth of overall revenues - have also suffered in the past year amid the more than 60 percent drop in oil prices CLc1. That has put pressure on Chief Executive Mark Donegan, who has held the role for 13 years, to improve results in the company’s core aircraft segment. Buffett seemed unperturbed by that recent history when talking about the deal on cable news channel CNBC. “I was very impressed by Mark, and of course I was impressed by the company,” Buffett said of meeting Donegan at Berkshire about five weeks ago. Berkshire had held a 3 percent stake in Precision.  Soon after that meeting, Buffett asked one of his investment managers, Todd Combs, to contact Precision about a bid. “They didn’t indicate they were particularly receptive, but they also indicated that they would listen,” Buffett said. [ID: nL3N10L3ST] Berkshire’s acquisition price of $235 a share represents a 21.2 percent premium over Precision’s closing price on Friday. Demand for new civilian aircraft is forecast to grow over the next several years. Boeing Co (BA.N) in June forecast that 160 million more people would travel by air this year, indicating a need for 900 new aircraft. Boeing (BA.N) and its main rival, Airbus (AIR.PA), say they expect to deliver more than 1,300 new aircraft this year. Both companies are pushing suppliers to support significant increases in the production rates for their most popular planes. Roughly 70 percent of Precision’s revenues in its last fiscal year came from selling blades used inside aircraft engines, bolts and other fasteners that help bind fuselages, and dozens of other products crucial to an airplane’s construction and maintenance. Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner aircraft relies heavily on Precision’s products and technology, as do jet engines built by General Electric Co (GE.N) and Rolls-Royce (RR.L).      Most of Precision’s sales are to customers in the United States, continuing a theme Buffett has outlined in the past that American industry is still worth the investment.     “There is no obvious synergy with the rest of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio,” Deutsche Bank analyst Miles Walton said. “This looks like a deal driven by the firm’s thinking that they are getting a large manufacturing firm in the aerospace industry well off its highs.” One of Precision’s top 10 investors, who spoke on condition of anonymity, shares the view that the company’s business is only “momentarily depressed” given the ramp-up of production in the global airline industry. “We think that in 18 months the company would have been worth $400 per share,” the investor said, citing a price 70 percent above Berkshire’s acquisition cost. “It’s a classic example of Berkshire buying a depressed asset at a great price,” the investor said. “The shareholders get cashed out, so they don’t get to participate in the upside.” ",8102015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-precision-cast-m-a-berkshire-hatha-ai/buffett-bets-precision-can-deliver-long-term-as-aircraft-sales-grow-idUSKCN0QF2D620150810

Copper rebounded from six-year lows and oil prices also rallied, helping push the S&P; 500 energy index up 3.1 percent, its biggest daily percentage jump since January, and the materials index up 2.5 percent. Disappointing economic data in China boosted hopes for additional stimulus from Beijing, lifting Chinese stocks. Adding to investor optimism, Greece and international creditors could wrap up a multibillion-euro bailout accord by Tuesday. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway  said it would buy Precision Castparts in a deal valuing the company at $32.3 billion. Precision Castparts’ shares jumped 19.1 percent to $230.92, while Berkshire’s Class B shares dipped 0.1 percent to $143.42. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 241.79 points, or 1.39 percent, to 17,615.17, the S&P; 500 gained 26.61 points, or 1.28 percent, to 2,104.18 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 58.25 points, or 1.16 percent, to 5,101.80. The benchmark S&P; 500 index registered its biggest daily percentage gain since May 8. After the bell, shares of Google climbed 4.8 percent after it announced it is changing its operating structure by setting up a new company called Alphabet Inc, which will include the search business and a number of other units. Stock futures rose further following the news. During the regular session, Twitter shares jumped 9.1 percent to $29.50 after CEO Jack Dorsey joined other insiders in buying more shares, while the company also clinched a multiyear partnership with the National Football League. On Friday, the Dow closed lower for the seventh straight session after solid U.S. jobs data for July pried the door open a little wider for a Federal Reserve rate hike in September. With U.S. interest rates near zero for almost a decade, debt has been cheap. But with the Fed widely expected to hike rates later this year, merger and acquisition activity has accelerated. July was the seventh strongest month for global deal activity since 1980.

924,BRKa,Buffett's biggest deal casts light on pension burden,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Growing pension obligations at Precision Castparts Corp PCP.N, which Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to buy for $32 billion, highlight an issue that large U.S. corporations still face, almost a decade into a low-interest rate environment.  Berkshire’s boss, Warren Buffett, has himself highlighted rising pension cost as an area of concern for the American economy. Back in 2007, Buffett said in a letter to shareholders that S&P; 500 companies should not expect above-average returns on their pension investments, as many companies publicly assumed at the time.  Obligations to retired workers pose an increasing risk to corporate bottom lines as investment returns in recent years have not consistently kept up with cost increases at most U.S. pension plans.  The industrial company Berkshire bought on Monday has been no exception, but the pension issue is not enough to raise alarm for Berkshire investors. “It could raise its costs a bit, but for a company of this size, it’s not significant,” said Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at New Albion Partners in New York.  Precision Castparts’ pension promises to pay $2.84 billion to its more than 10,300 participants, but was underfunded by $615 million of as of March 29, the end of its most recent fiscal year. That level of underfunding was up 61.8 percent from the prior year.  If Precision Castparts’ pension costs continue to rise quickly, they could limit the new business’s ability to contribute to Berkshire’s operating profit in coming years, but no one is predicting a major headwind.  Still, its recent history shows how hard it can be for pension plans to meet their stated goals.  Over the past five years, Precision Castparts’ return on pensions came close to its projections but never quite met them, according to company filings. Its return on plan assets averaged 7.46 percent, but that performance has been uneven. It earned 10.2 percent for fiscal 2015, but just 4.5 percent the prior year. According to Precision’s most recent 10K filing, it assumed a long-term return of 7.75 percent for its U.S. retirement plans and 7.25 percent for its non-U.S. plans in fiscal 2015. It expected to assume the same returns for fiscal 2016. Since Precision Castparts’ fiscal 2015 returns were solid but did not keep up with obligations, its funding deficit jumped.  With stock markets flat and bond yields down so far in 2015, a 7.75 percent target could be out of reach.  “We are fully compliant with PCBG funding requirements, ERISA guidelines and are mindful of our fiduciary responsibilities to the beneficiaries of the fund,” Precision said in a statement. Berkshire did not immediately respond to requests for comment. To be fair, many U.S. corporations, even Berkshire, saw the funding status of their pensions deteriorate last year due to a jump in obligations and historic low interest rates, according to a consulting firm Milliman.  Companies can address underfunding by adding more cash, asking for deferrals, issuing bonds, or finding other ways to finance pensions - all of which add to risk and the cost of doing business. Pension funding deficits worsened in July among the 100 biggest U.S. corporate pensions Milliman tracks as bond yields fell on worries about Greece’s debt and Chinese stock market turmoil. A sustained drop in bond yields raises the amount of cash a pension requires to ensure it meets future payouts.  In its most recent regulatory filing, Precision Castparts said it plans to contribute $51 million in fiscal 2016, up from $34 million from fiscal 2015. That comes to 35 cents a share, or about a 3-percent drag on earnings-per-share for Precision Castparts, according to Thomson Reuters data. When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, it would support higher bond yields, helping Precision’s and other U.S. pensions to reduce their funding deficits, said Zorast Wadia, principal and consulting actuary at Milliman.

The opinions expressed are his own) By James Saft Aug 12 (Reuters) - Deciding if you want to bet on Alphabet is essentially a choice on what you want to back: Sergey Brin and Larry Page or human nature. Brin and Page have changed the world and created a cash flow behemoth in Google. Human nature, on the other hand, has created every other conglomerate, which, with the possible exception of Berkshire Hathaway, have a general record of capital misallocation and underperformance. Alphabet, of course, is the new holding company Brin and Page have created, and will head, which will comprise both Google and their far-flung and growing list of other companies working on everything from longevity to contact lenses that can measure blood glucose in diabetics. This isn’t so much Google, or Alphabet, becoming a conglomerate as codifying how its collection of companies and investments will be managed. The new structure offers certain advantages, freeing the co-founders to concentrate on ‘moonshot’ efforts while cleaning up lines should it want debt finance. None of this should be a surprise. Page and Brin have always been upfront about not managing for shareholder value maximization. And last year they created an additional class of shares, one which, as it has no voting rights, will allow them to raise capital and reward executives but lose control over the direction of the company at a slower pace. So, then, a conglomerate, with all that implies, and one with multiple share classes insulating the founders from the will of shareholders. What, as they say, could possibly go wrong? Investors in publicly traded companies have a hugely diverging set of options these days, few of them particularly satisfying from a shareholder’s point of view. On the one hand you have far too many companies which are giving financial engineering, usually via share buybacks, precedence over investment in their core franchise. That’s problematic because investors risk seeing that franchise hollowed out over time as manager prioritize making quarter-by-quarter increases in earnings, even illusory ones, over building. On the other hand you have the mad builders, of which Alphabet nee Google is a prime example. My reservation isn’t whether the core cash flow machine Google, which produces some $20 billion annually in operating cash, is fairly priced. Instead it is who gets a shot at the fruits of those profits, and how. To want to buy Alphabet, and clearly many do, you have got to be willing to give up a lot of customary protection in exchange for access to their world-changing genius. While quite a few technology companies such as Alibaba and Facebook have dual or multiple share structures, the man making the most convincing, at least to the market, argument for the conglomerate is Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway is just that, and has a long record of success. Buffett stands in contrast to Brin and Page, offering discipline and patience as a capital allocator where they offer inspiration and ‘moonshots’. Warren, after all, would never try to tell you that Dairy Queen will help you live to 150, only that it is a business which can be profitable over the long term if managed well. So both companies are votes on exceptionalism, Buffett’s or Alphabet’s. The rules which make the exceptions in conglomerates and multi-share class companies meaningful, however, are not encouraging. Conglomerates as a group trade at a structural discount to intrinsic value, a phenomenon which has gone on so long it even has a name, the ‘conglomerate discount’. This discount in 2012 stood at about 10 percent, according to Boston Consulting, a bit less than the 14 percent or so average since 1990. That’s because conglomerates have a poor track record of capital allocation, being prone to supporting executives’ dreams of empire rather than taking a gimlet-eyed view of return on equity. A 2012 study by Institutional Shareholder Services, funded by the Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute, found that tightly controlled companies - especially those with multiple share classes - generally underperform over the longer term. (here All of this is as unshocking as it gets. Human nature argues that Alphabet, and perhaps even Berkshire Hathaway, will be likely to fall prey to the same shareholder-damaging behavior that undermines the groups of which they are emblematic. Some might conceivably feel they just can’t afford not to be exposed to Alphabet. I myself am glad they are doing this investing, some of which may lead to exciting or even world-changing businesses. I am gladder still they are doing it with someone else's money.  (At the time of publication James Saft did not own any direct investments in securities mentioned in this article.

Berkshire also appeared to have shed its stakes in oilfield equipment provider National Oilwell Varco Inc (NOV.N) and refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N) in the second quarter, as the oil industry struggles with falling prices.

928,BRKa,Hedge funds bought into Precision before Buffett arrived,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Legendary investor Warren Buffett was not the only one to turn sweet on Precision Castparts Corp this summer. A handful of prominent money managers, including billionaire activist investor Barry Rosenstein, placed big new bets on the aerospace supplier during the second quarter, just weeks before Buffett swooped in to buy the entire company. Buffett’s plan to pay $32.3 billion for the Precision Castparts Corp, announced on Monday, helped push the stock price up nearly 19 percent this week, likely making for a handsome payoff for the funds that took new positions or raised stakes. Buffett had been a long-term investor before deciding that he liked the company so much that he had to own the whole thing, making for the biggest takeover ever for his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Rosenstein’s roughly $11 billion Jana Partners bought 2.5 million shares during the quarter, according to a regulatory filing released on Friday. Jana Partners gained 1.3 percent through the end of July, one investor said. The fund was sure to have gotten a shot in the arm from the bump in Precision’s share price. While Rosenstein is by far the biggest new stakeholder, he was not alone in coming in at a time the company’s stock price had been falling. The share price, which is still down about 4 percent this year, had fallen roughly 17 percent during the first half. Davis Selected Advisers took a new stake with 2 million shares, Hitchwood Capital Management established a new position by buying 800,000 shares. New bets were also made by Holland Capital Management which bought 344,616 shares and Samlyn Capital which owned 224,160 shares at the end of the quarter. Taconic Capital Advisors opened a new position with 110,000 shares. Fund managers are required by U.S. regulators to say what they owned at the end of each quarter and those so-called 13-F filings, while backward looking, can often illustrate new investment trends and hint at who won and lost in the secretive hedge fund industry. In addition to the newcomers, other prominent hedge funds poured more money into Precision Castparts during the second quarter, raising the stakes they already owned. Soroban Capital Partners bought 706,600 shares to own 3.2 million shares. It also bought call options on 1 million shares. Farallon Capital added 232,299 shares, boosting its stake to 949,299 shares.

The largest of these was Warren Buffet’s $30 billion-plus purchase of Precision Castparts PCP.N, announced on Monday. The takeover is the biggest by Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N). So far this year, $2.9 trillion in deals have been announced globally, only 3 percent below the $3 trillion record peak in 2007. Domestic M&A; in the U.S. has reached a total of $1.4 trillion, a 62 percent increase on this time last year. Acquisitions of U.S. companies account for almost half of the total worldwide value of deals in dollars terms.  In the Asia Pacific region, dealmaking is off to its best start for the year since records began, outpacing Europe for the first time and making up 23 percent of global dealmaking. But on Tuesday, the Chinese central bank devalued its currency, causing volatility across global financial markets.  It is unclear yet whether these measures, coupled with a slowdown in China, could diminish the appetite for takeovers in the region.

938,BRKa,Boeing uses its clout to control supplier consolidation,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s $37 billion deal for aerospace supplier Precision Castparts Corp is encouraging investors to consolidate the fragmented aircraft components industry, even as Boeing Co uses its clout as the world’s biggest plane maker to put a check on some deals. Berkshire chief Warren Buffett isn’t alone in seeing potential for profits from rising demand for commercial aircraft. Private equity and strategic buyers have been pouring into the sector, and foreign companies such as China’s AVIC and Senior PLC of the UK have recently been prowling for deals, bankers and company executives said. Potentially standing in their way, though, is Boeing, these people said. Boeing is the biggest customer of most aerospace suppliers, and is slowing some acquisitions by using its power to approve the transfer of its supply contracts from one owner to another. Boeing can act like as an unofficial regulator on aerospace mergers and acquisitions because of the “assignability clause” inserted in most of its contracts with suppliers. The clause allows Boeing to refuse to transfer the contracts to the new owners, giving it a de facto veto over deals. Boeing said it hasn’t changed the process it uses to scrutinize mergers and acquisitions among suppliers, and that the time taken depends on the size and complexity of the deal. Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg, who took over July 1, is continuing predecessor Jim McNerney’s policy of “de-risking.” “We have an ability to have our voice heard in the M&A; process and we use that ability,” said Kent Fisher, vice president and general manager of suppliers at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. But bankers and company owners said approvals from Boeing that used to take a couple of weeks now take much longer, putting deals at risk, with no explanation from Boeing for the delay. “Any time you have a pause in a transaction, it increases the risk that it won’t get across the finish line,” said Brian Murphy, a managing director at Meridian Capital, an investment bank based in Seattle. For example, Boeing took four months to approve the purchase of a small supplier by Liberty Hall Capital Partners, a New York private equity firm focused on aerospace and defense. LaCroix Industries, which has 45 employees and was founded in Kent, Washington, in 1977, has long supplied parts directly to Boeing for the 737, 777 and 787 jets. It earned awards from Boeing for near-perfect quality the last seven years, co-founder Philip LaCroix said. The company began talks with Liberty Hall last September, and sought Boeing’s blessing in April, he said. Boeing took until July to consent, and the deal closed that month. “The approvals from Boeing were the major slowdown” and Boeing wouldn’t say what was causing the delay, LaCroix said in an interview.  “That part of it was frustrating,” he said. “You could lose a deal over something like that, where the acquirer says, ‘Hey, I’m out of this.’” Liberty Hall declined to comment. It plans to integrate LaCroix into its Irving, Texas-based Accurus Aerospace Corp subsidiary, which also supplies Boeing.  LaCroix had already agreed to give Boeing 15 percent price cuts on existing contracts, starting in 2016. The alternative was slow death by losing the right to bid on future work, LaCroix said.  “Staying in business with Boeing was much preferable,” he said, “and still had plenty of profit for us.” Some bankers say they routinely exclude potential bidders for a company if they know those won’t pass muster with Boeing, which looks at financial strength, track record and investment intentions of prospective buyers. Some also see the logic of talking with Boeing about meeting assignability requirements, and understand Boeing’s need to minimize supply chain risk. “Reviewing the companies that would acquire their suppliers is part of that,” said Jet Wales, a managing director at Moss Adams Capital in Seattle. North American aerospace and defense deals shot up 17 percent last year and their value nearly doubled to about $12 billion, Thomson Reuters data show. Private equity buyers are involved in an increasing number of transactions, according to data from PitchBook, a Seattle firm that tracks transactions, fueling competition for choice targets. The big attraction: Boeing’s eight-year backlog of commercial jet orders worth $431 billion. Investors see an assured revenue stream and have bid up the prices of supplier companies to lofty levels. Ownership changes can increase risk, however. A stumble by a key supplier can disrupt Boeing’s carefully orchestrated factories and run up hefty costs. When Zodiac Aerospace of France failed to deliver premium seats earlier this year, it delayed delivery of 787s to American Airlines and hit Boeing with what analysts said were several hundred million dollars in added costs. Boeing said those estimates are overstated. Many experts expect Buffett’s aerospace purchase will spur even more consolidation, and likely will prompt Boeing to look even more closely at deals that affect its suppliers.     Precision Castparts, a 60-year-old firm based in Portland, Oregon, locked up key aerospace products and production capabilities by doing its own strategic acquisitions. It is now an integral supplier of parts for commercial and military aircraft and engines. “Boeing woke up to the fact after the fact,” said Christian Schiller, a managing director at Cascadia Capital investment bank in Seattle, referring to Precision’s success in achieving vertical integration. “They couldn’t undo it, so they’re making sure they can exert more control over the M&A; process to make sure a PCC doesn’t happen again.” He and other bankers said Boeing has a legitimate need to protect its interests and avoid the rise of another powerful supplier. “But Boeing should make it easier for the smaller deals to go forward,” Schiller said. “There’s no need to take really hard looks at $10 million to $100 million deals.” Boeing subjects even small deals to detailed scrutiny, such as the 2013 purchase by Kidd & Co and Centerfield Capital Partners of Imaginetics Inc, then a 120-person precision machining shop in Auburn, Washington, a top supplier to Boeing. Approval took more than a month, said a source familiar with the deal. Imaginetics declined to comment. “Boeing has turned up the heat on who is the buyer and is taking longer to decide that a deal is OK,” said Michael Black, a principal at Zachary Scott, an investment bank in Seattle. “They’ve got a pretty tough filter and it’s gotten tougher and I don’t see that changing.” ",8302015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-boeing-m-a-insight/boeing-uses-its-clout-to-control-supplier-consolidation-idUSKCN0QZ0HS20150830
939,BRKa,INSIGHT-Boeing uses its clout to control supplier consolidation,"NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s  $37 billion deal for aerospace supplier Precision Castparts Corp is encouraging investors to consolidate the fragmented aircraft components industry, even as Boeing Co  uses its clout as the world’s biggest plane maker to put a check on some deals. Berkshire chief Warren Buffett isn’t alone in seeing potential for profits from rising demand for commercial aircraft. Private equity and strategic buyers have been pouring into the sector, and foreign companies such as China’s AVIC and Senior PLC of the UK have recently been prowling for deals, bankers and company executives said. Potentially standing in their way, though, is Boeing, these people said. Boeing is the biggest customer of most aerospace suppliers, and is slowing some acquisitions by using its power to approve the transfer of its supply contracts from one owner to another. Boeing can act like as an unofficial regulator on aerospace mergers and acquisitions because of the “assignability clause” inserted in most of its contracts with suppliers. The clause allows Boeing to refuse to transfer the contracts to the new owners, giving it a de facto veto over deals. Boeing said it hasn’t changed the process it uses to scrutinize mergers and acquisitions among suppliers, and that the time taken depends on the size and complexity of the deal.

942,BRKa,Warren Buffett says Berkshire Hathaway still shopping abroad,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investing icon Warren Buffett said on Tuesday there are dozens of countries in which his sprawling Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) conglomerate would be interested in buying new businesses. Berkshire earlier this year agreed to acquire a German motorcycle apparel and accessories retailer - a purchase that Buffett described as an advertisement to markets that he is shopping abroad. “It was an ad. It was an ad that paid us,” said Buffett, 85, who over the past five decades has built Berkshire Hathaway into one of the world’s most valuable companies.  Buffett - the world’s third richest person, according to Forbes, with a fortune of $72.7 billion - is avidly followed by investors, and his opinions on companies and assets move markets globally. He spoke to Reuters in an interview while in New York for the Glide Foundation’s 16th annual event charity lunch. Glide is a nonprofit in San Francisco’s Tenderloin district that provides food, healthcare, rehabilitation and other services to the poor and homeless. Buffett said he is most likely to hunt for acquisition targets in big economies. “I like larger economies simply because we want to buy things of size, but there’s dozens of countries I would be delighted to buy in,” he said. “The price would have to be right too.”     Buffett is particularly known for acquisitions: Berkshire Hathaway now includes more than 80 companies, selling everything from ice cream to insurance. While the so-called Oracle of Omaha has consistently said he wants to keep a $20 billion cash cushion on hand, that still leaves him a significant bankroll for buying more companies. Berkshire Hathaway ended the second quarter with $66.59 billion of cash. Since then the company announced it had agreed to purchase Precision Castparts Corp PCP.N in a deal that values the maker of aerospace and other parts at $32.3 billion.     Berkshire Hathaway also recently issued debt in euros, and Buffett said he would consider issuing more debt in the future denominated in foreign currencies.  He said Berkshire Hathaway would need to have ample assets in the currency of any future bonds it issues. In politics, Buffett praised Democrat Hillary Clinton, who is vying for her party’s nomination for the presidency, saying she would “work like the dickens” should she win the November 2016 election. Nevertheless, he did suggest that Clinton’s proposal to offer tax cuts for profit-sharing firms might not be the best option.     “To prescribe how much they (employers) pay, or how they pay it ... I don’t think that works well in the market economy,” Buffett said.      Clinton has faced increased pressure on the left from Vermont’s Bernie Sanders. While Buffett praised Sanders’ campaigning skills, he has said previously that he is unlikely to vote for the progressive senator. While market economies do produce some inequality, Buffett said, he lamented that so many Americans now find themselves struggling in the world’s biggest economy. To help combat poverty, Buffett called for a “significantly” larger earned income tax credit for lower income Americans.

943,BRKa,Berkshire's Buffett says bought some IBM shares in third quarter: CNBC,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, the billionaire chief executive officer and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, told CNBC on Tuesday that he added to his share stake in International Business Machines Corp in the third quarter.  “We bought it in the first quarter, and normally I wouldn’t tell you this, but we bought some in the third quarter,” Buffett told the cable television network.  Buffett’s Berkshire owned a more than 8 percent stake in IBM as of June 30. IBM shares, which have slumped nearly 12 percent so far in the third quarter through last Friday during broad stock market volatility, last traded up 1.9 percent at $146.42 in afternoon trading Tuesday.  Buffett also said that the U.S. economy was not growing at a “booming” rate but remained on the path it has been on for six years of growing at a rate of 2 percent or a little better annually. He said he would “be a little careful” about getting too excited about quarterly statistics. Buffett made his comments after Commerce Department data in late August showed U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a 3.7 percent annual pace in the second quarter instead of the 2.3 percent rate reported the previous month.  Buffett also said Berkshire still has ample cash after agreeing to buy Precision Castparts Corp for over $32 billion and would never hold less than $20 billion in cash. “I’ve still got money left to buy, I’ll never go below $20 billion of cash, in fact I won’t even really go very close to it,” he said.  He said Berkshire “might be a little less aggressive in the open market” given the Precision Castparts deal, but added: “I haven’t held back from doing anything because of that upcoming purchase.” Buffett, whose Berkshire owns warrants entitling it to buy 700 million Bank of America shares at $7.14 each between now and 2021, said that if he could vote on Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan’s title, he would vote to have him in both the CEO and chairman roles. Buffett also said Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders “has run a model campaign” and said the 2016 Republican presidential race reminded him of “being at an amusement park and watching all the kids in bumper cars.” “What you’re seeing is indicative of a lot of dissatisfaction in the country with Washington politicians and perhaps the media to some extent too.” ",9082015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-hatha-buffett/berkshires-buffett-says-bought-some-ibm-shares-in-third-quarter-cnbc-idUSKCN0R822R20150908

951,BRKa,"UPDATE 3-Goldman to release results on website, not BusinessWire - source","(Adds comments from Zillow) By Olivia Oran and Richa Naidu Oct 8 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc will release its third-quarter results next week through its website and Twitter, not through BusinessWire, as it seeks more control over the handling of sensitive information, a person familiar with the matter said. Goldman’s decision follows several incidents involving inadvertent or early releases of press statements and hacking of companies that provide such services. The bank declined to comment. “They’re not necessarily pulling away,” a BusinessWire spokesman said on Thursday. Goldman is just testing a new concept for disclosure this time and BusinessWire still has a good relationship with the bank, he said. The U.S. Department of Justice charged nine people in August over allegations of hacking at three leading newswire services - BusinessWire, which is owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Marketwired and PR Newswire. (1.usa.gov/1VGyK8U) The hackers stole more than 150,000 unpublished press releases containing financial information. Goldman is often at the forefront when it comes to Wall Street’s presence on social media. The bank’s former technology banker, Anthony Noto, is now Twitter Inc’s chief financial officer. The bank rolled out a series of recruiting ads on Snapchat last month, becoming the first major U.S. lender to turn to the instant-but-fleeting messaging app for potential hires. A growing number of companies have started to use Twitter to post links to their earnings since the Securities and Exchange Commission began allowing companies to use social media outlets to disclose material information two years ago. For example, Zillow Group Inc, was one of the first to do so. The Seattle-based online real estate listings provider began posting its earnings on Twitter in May of 2013 and also inviting users to submit questions to management about the earnings via Twitter. “We saw it as a way to get questions not just on our earnings call but from a broader base of investors,” said Jeremy Wacksman, chief marketing officer at Zillow, in an interview with Reuters Wednesday morning. Zillow also posts its earnings on its website and through GlobeNewswire.

953,BRKa,UPDATE 2-SunPower to sell projects in power plant unit - CEO,"(Adds CEO comments, details) By Anet Josline Pinto and Darshana Sankararaman Oct 28 (Reuters) - No. 2 U.S. solar panel maker SunPower Corp is looking to sell projects in its power plant business and potential buyers include Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Chief Executive Officer Thomas Werner told Reuters. The company first plans to offer the project to 8Point3 Energy Partners LP, a joint venture between SunPower and rival First Solar Inc that went public in June. If the deal does not go through, SunPower would directly approach other American utilities and American banks that fit the right profile of buyers, Werner said. “Berkshire Hathaway (Energy) is one of the potential buyers of the power plant projects if 8Point3 chooses not to buy,” Werner said on Wednesday. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a unit of Warren Buffett-led holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc, was not immediately available for comment. SunPower’s power plant business, which has been posting falling revenues for the past three quarters, accounted for nearly 35 percent of its total revenue in the quarter ended Sept. 27. The company said it would make its final decision by the first half of 2016. SunPower, majority owned by French energy giant Total SA , in 2013 had sold one of the largest solar projects in the world to Berkshire Hathaway Energy. The project, which is located in Southern California, has a capacity to generate 579 megawatts of power. SunPower on Wednesday also reported a surprise quarterly profit, helped by strong demand for rooftop installation, and forecast 2015 earnings above expectations. SunPower said it expected 2015 adjusted profit of $1.95 to $2.05 per share, above the average analyst estimate of $1.56, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Third-quarter revenue of $441.4 million also beat analysts expectations of $428.9 million. Excluding items, SunPower earned 13 cents per share. Analysts expected a loss of 2 cents per share. SunPower’s shares, which have fallen 5 percent this year through its Monday close, rose 6.2 percent in after-market trade.

954,BRKa,Berkshire profit doubles to record on Kraft Heinz,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) said quarterly profit doubled to a record high, reflecting a large gain on its stake in Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), while operating profit declined on weaker results from insurance underwriting. Third-quarter net income rose to $9.43 billion, or $5,737 per Class A share, from $4.62 billion, or $2,811, a year earlier. Operating profit fell 4 percent to $4.55 billion, or $2,769 per share, from $4.72 billion, or $2,876.     Analysts on average expected operating profit of $2,720.60 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Among Berkshire’s larger businesses, profit fell 34 percent from insurance underwriting to $414 million, rose 12 percent at the BNSF railroad to $1.16 billion, and rose 13 percent to $786 million at Berkshire Hathaway Energy. “Overall, quite decent operating earnings,” said Jeff Matthews, a principal at the Ram Partners LP hedge fund and author of “Pilgrimage to Warren Buffett’s Omaha.” “Nothing wrong with that given the weakness in the industrial side of the economy.” Berkshire has close to 90 operating businesses including the General Re reinsurer, Lubrizol chemicals, NetJets business jets and Dairy Queen ice cream. Buffett, 85, has run Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire since 1965. Results reflected a roughly $6.8 billion pre-tax gain, or $4.4 billion after taxes, on Kraft Heinz. Buffett helped finance the July merger that created the food company, whose products include Oscar Mayer sandwich meats, Jell-O and Heinz ketchup, and is its largest shareholder with  26.8 percent stake. Berkshire had previously owned a majority of the former H.J. Heinz Co, and at the time of the merger had more than doubled its original investment in just two years. “Even given its large size, Berkshire can still pull off deals and investments that remain meaningful,” said James Armstrong, who invests $550 million as president of Henry H. Armstrong Associates in Pittsburgh. He said 20 percent of that sum is in Berkshire. Private equity firm 3G Capital owns about 24.2 percent of Kraft Heinz and has day-to-day oversight. It announced plans this week to close seven plants and cut 2,600 jobs there. Berkshire’s gain reflects “the hard work 3G has done cutting costs at Heinz and now Kraft,” said Matthews, who recently sold his Berkshire stock. “Warren Buffett, the billionaire, is getting richer on cost cuts while 2,600 families are getting poorer. It’s a shame.” Quarterly revenue at Berkshire rose 15 percent to $58.99 billion, largely from Kraft Heinz. Book value, reflecting assets minus liabilities and Buffett’s preferred growth gauge, was $151,083 per Class A share as of Sept. 30, up 0.9 percent from the end of June. Berkshire’s prior record profit was $6.4 billion in the second quarter of 2014, also helped by a one-time gain. Kraft Heinz helped Berkshire offset recent struggles with large investments such as International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and American Express Co (AXP.N) and in operating units including the Geico auto insurer, as well as losses from derivatives. Berkshire said it had lost $2 billion on its IBM stock, or 15 percent of what it paid, as of Sept. 30 but still has “no intention” of selling its shares. The price of Berkshire's Class A shares is down 10 percent this year, lagging the 2 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX. Profit from insurance underwriting fell in part because of weakness at General Re and losses on variable annuity guarantee contracts at Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Geico recovered after a poor quarter, seeing pretax underwriting gains drop just 2 percent to $258 million. Like other insurers, Geico has experienced increased losses from accidents as people drive more, causing it to boost premiums. Berkshire said profit at BNSF was bolstered by “improved operating performance,” as the railroad spends $6 billion to add capacity and improve service following shortfalls in 2014. Buffett is working to finish Berkshire’s largest purchase, a roughly $31.7 billion takeover of aerospace parts maker Precision Castparts Corp PCP.N. Berkshire had $66.26 billion of cash as of Sept. 30. Buffett has said he plans to spend about one-third of that on Precision Castparts. He wants to keep a $20 billion cash cushion.

In a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Berkshire said it owned 10.96 million Goldman shares worth about $1.9 billion as of Sept. 30, down from 12.63 million shares worth $2.64 billion three months earlier. Buffett told CNBC television he sold the Goldman shares and 7 percent of his stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) to help fund Berkshire’s $31.7 billion takeover of aerospace parts maker Precision Castparts Corp PCP.N, not because he soured on either company. The billionaire has long preferred that Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire own whole companies rather than individual stocks.

Buffett also told CNBC he was selling investments in reinsurers Munich Re (MUVGn.DE) and Swiss Re SRENH.VX, and not selling securities as a result of Friday’s attacks in Paris. Goldman turned to Buffett for support a week after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc went bankrupt, prompting Berkshire to buy $5 billion in preferred stock plus warrants to purchase $5 billion of shares at $115 each. After Goldman redeemed the preferred stock, Berkshire renegotiated the warrants, and acquired a smaller number of Goldman shares in a cashless transaction. The sales of Goldman and Wal-Mart were disclosed in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing detailing Berkshire’s $127.4 billion U.S. stock portfolio on Sept. 30. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) remained Berkshire’s biggest stock holding, worth roughly $24.1 billion, followed by Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) at $23 billion. H.J.

960,BRKa,Venezuela President says may jail Heinz managers for 'sabotage',"CARACAS (Reuters) - The managers of Kraft Heinz’s Venezuelan operations may be imprisoned if found committing “sabotage”, President Nicolas Maduro said on state television Tuesday night. The latest move against a multinational company in Venezuela comes days before legislative elections in which the ruling Socialist Party is expected to lose its majority in the National Assembly for the first time in a decade and a half. It is not the first time the president has rallied against business leaders and ordered their imprisonment, following in the footsteps of his predecessor Hugo Chavez who expropriated small to multinational business operations in Venezuela. Maduro said during a four-hour television program that workers had denounced the food and beverage company for “unjustifiably” paralyzing production lines. “If the managers are committing sabotage, here’s the head of Sebin (Venezuela’s intelligence service) and he’ll put them in prison right away,” said Maduro, adding that officials would visit factories first thing Wednesday morning. “Enough of the bourgeoisie. Imprison them.” The economy is one of voters’ key concerns, with inflation thought to be in the triple digits and shortages of the most basic goods leading to long supermarket lines. Critics see Maduro’s anti-business rhetoric as an attempt to drum up support ahead of Sunday’s vote, and say attacking businesses will only worsen shortages.

11,BRKa,Sequoia Fund is sued over big Valeant stake,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The investment firm that runs the Sequoia Fund, long known for its ties to Warren Buffett, was sued by shareholders who claim it recklessly took a huge stake in embattled drug company Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc VRX.TO, causing more than $2 billion in losses. Investment firm Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb; portfolio managers Robert Goldfarb and David Poppe; and two directors were accused of gross negligence for letting Sequoia amass a Valeant stake that peaked at 32 percent of its portfolio in August. According to the complaint filed on Friday in a New York state court in Manhattan, this violated Sequoia’s policy of not investing more than 25 percent of assets in one industry. The complaint also called it the “antithesis” of Sequoia’s strategy of seeking investments such as Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), its second-largest holding, that represent “value-oriented” investing. Valeant shares have lost about two-thirds of their value since early August amid concerns about its drug pricing, merger appetite and since-severed ties to a mail-order pharmacy. Sequoia’s investment “is akin to a gambler at the race track betting more than one quarter of his net worth on a fast horse with a history of maladies and with improbably high odds,” the complaint said. “Just as it should come as no surprise to the gambler when the horse pulls up lame, the same holds equally true for the defendants,” it added. Other defendants include the author Roger Lowenstein, who chairs Sequoia’s board, and director Robert Swiggett. The lawsuit seeks to recoup damages and management fees for the fund. Ruane, Cunniff and lawyers for the defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Two other independent directors, including Buffett bridge partner Sharon Osberg, quit Sequoia’s board last October. The lawsuit cites news reports that those directors objected to the Valeant stake, and recounts criticism of Valeant by Charles Munger, Berkshire’s vice chairman. Ruane, Cunniff’s late founder, William Ruane, was a friend of Buffett, who, like Sequoia, is known for concentrated bets. The $6.3 billion Sequoia fund has returned an average 7.23 percent annually over 15 years, in the top percentile among peers, according to mutual fund information provider Morningstar Inc. But in 2015, the Valeant stake led to an overall 7.29 percent loss, trailing 97 percent of peers. In an Oct. 28 shareholder letter, Goldfarb and Poppe defended Valeant, saying the company “is an aggressively-managed business that may push boundaries, but operates within the law.” The case is Epstein et al v.

13,BRKa,Federal probe sought for Buffett's mobile home unit,"Jan 13 (Reuters) - Senior U.S. Democratic lawmakers asked federal regulators to investigate whether Clayton Homes, the mobile home unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc , targets minority borrowers with discriminatory lending and collection practices. A letter on Tuesday from Representative Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, and fellow committee members Michael Capuano, Emanuel Cleaver and Keith Ellison called on the Justice Department and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to “pursue appropriate corrective action” against Clayton. It followed a report last month by the Seattle Times newspaper and online BuzzFeed News accusing the largest U.S. mobile home builder of exploiting black, Latino and Native American borrowers by driving them into subprime loans they cannot afford, and harming communities by repossessing homes after borrowers default. That report also claimed that Clayton’s corporate culture condones racism, including against its own workers. The representatives said the “disturbing business model” described in the report was “highly problematic,” in light of Clayton’s “uniquely broad control of the manufacture, sale and financing of manufactured homes.” Clayton did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment on the letter, which the Seattle Times reported earlier. Last month, the Maryville, Tennessee-based company “categorically and adamantly” denied discriminating against borrowers, and defended the practices of two lending arms, Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance Inc and 21st Mortgage Corp. “Race and ethnicity are never considered in pricing or structuring our loans,” the company said. Clayton added that it does not tolerate discrimination against its workers. As of Sept. 30, Clayton borrowers were current on roughly 95 percent of their loans, Berkshire has said. Buffett did not immediately respond on Wednesday to a email request for comment sent to an assistant. At Berkshire’s annual meeting last May, Buffett said he made “no apologies whatsoever” about Clayton’s “exemplary” lending, in response to a question about an earlier Seattle Times story saying that Clayton trapped borrowers into unaffordable loans on depreciating homes. The Justice Department and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Berkshire bought Clayton for $1.7 billion in August 2003. The unit generates roughly 2 percent of overall pretax profit at Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, which owns close to 90 businesses, including the Geico auto insurer, BNSF railroad and Dairy Queen ice cream stores.

14,BRKa,UPDATE 1-Rail mergers could be 'destructive' to shareholder value - CSX CEO,"(Adds context for regulatory review process) By Nick Carey CHICAGO, Jan 13 (Reuters) - No. 3 U.S. railroad CSX Corp  does not see any compelling benefits stemming from mergers of major railroads in North America and fears regulatory burdens could be attached to the approval of deals that would add to the cost of doing business, the railroad’s top executive said on Wednesday. “The benefits seem somewhat unconvincing, I really think the Class I railroads have great opportunities to create shareholder value without mergers,” Chief Executive Michael Ward told Reuters by phone when asked about Canadian Pacific’s  unsolicited bid for No. 4 U.S. railroad Norfolk Southern Corp . “I think mergers could actually be destructive of shareholder value,” he added. Ward said that CSX has met with representatives of other major railroads in the presence of legal counsel. Those representatives include Matt Rose, chairman of BNSF, the No. 2 U.S. railroad which is owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. No. 1 U.S. railroad Union Pacific Corp’s chief executive Lance Fritz told Reuters on Wednesday he believes major railroad mergers are not in the interest of the rail industry or customers and is working behind the scenes to make sure none take place. By law, major U.S. railroads may only discuss topics that affect the entire industry. “We haven’t had any new consensus come out of this,” Ward said. “To be honest we’ve had one or two discussions, but we were all against mergers to begin with.” Canadian Pacific in mid-November disclosed its $28 billion offer to buy Norfolk Southern. Norfolk Southern has rejected the Canadian railroad’s advances, setting the stage for a possible proxy battle. Any deal would be expected to face a tough review from rail regulator the Surface Transportation Board (STB), which would judge whether it was in the public interest. The STB significantly tightened its guidelines for mergers following a slew of deals in the 1990s. There are also questions about whether the voting trust Canadian Pacific has proposed would pass muster. “It’s highly questionable whether (a deal) would pass the aggressive scrutiny of the two high standards of public interest and pre-approval control,” Ward said. CSX’s CEO spoke to Reuters the day after the railroad posted fourth-quarter results. The company saw freight volumes fall 6 percent in the quarter and Ward said the only bright spots at the moment for 2016 are automotive and housing. “The rest of the markets all have challenges,” he said. Coal volumes, which were down 32 percent last quarter will continue to fall this year, metals will be down because of low commodity prices and the strong U.S. dollar and “farmers have been holding onto their corn because they’re hoping for higher prices.” As a result, CSX expects lower earnings per share in 2016 compared with 2015. “We’ll focus on things we can control this year,” Ward said. “We’ll focus on efficiency and productivity.”   (Reporting by Nick Carey, editing by G Crosse and Alan Crosby)",1132016,http://www.reuters.com/article/railways-ma-csx/update-1-rail-mergers-could-be-destructive-to-shareholder-value-csx-ceo-idUSL2N14X2A920160113

(Reuters) - A potential merger of Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd and Norfolk Southern would make it hard for No. 3 U.S. railroad CSX Corp to survive alone and ratchet up pressure for more industry consolidation, the chairman of No. 2 U.S. railroad BNSF said on Thursday. “CSX would be at an enormous (competitive) disadvantage and so there would be another step towards consolidation,” Matt Rose told Reuters on the sidelines of the semiannual meeting of the Midwest Association of Rail Shippers. Rose reiterated that this is not the right time for mergers as “our belief is that our customers do not want mergers to occur.” But he said if a merger of Canadian Pacific and Norfolk Southern appeared likely then BNSF, which is owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, would bid for another railroad.  Canadian Pacific in mid-November disclosed its $28 billion offer to buy Norfolk Southern. Norfolk Southern has spurned the Canadian railroad’s interest, setting the scene for a proxy battle. Some customers and legislators have written to the Surface Transportation Board, the regulator that would review any merger proposal, opposing the proposed deal. Rose said BNSF would not likely make a competitive bid for Norfolk Southern. Canadian Pacific has said operating synergies from a merger with Norfolk Southern would lead to savings of more than $1.8 billion. Rose said that figure is very high compared with prior rail mergers.  “I don’t know if we would ever do a competitive bid for Norfolk Southern because we don’t see $1.8 billion in natural synergies. We may (do a bid), but we think the synergy numbers are enormous.” Any deal would likely face a review from the Surface Transportation Board, which tightened guidelines for mergers following a slew of deals in the 1990s. The regulator would have to weigh whether a Canadian Pacific and Norfolk Southern merger would lead to other deals. Rose said a deal would see the “final map redrawn” for North America’s railroads. “You don’t have to have a lot of imagination when there’s only seven railroads to get down to two railroads,” he said. “The chairs get taken away pretty quick.” Rose said he has discussed the merger issue with Buffett and has his support for whatever is in the long-term interests of BNSF. “He expects me to run this company. But if I went to him and said I need $30 billion to buy a railroad, we would have more than a phone conversation.” ",1142016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-hatha-bnsf/cp-norfolk-merger-would-put-csx-in-crosshairs-bnsf-chairman-idUSKCN0US2BY20160114
18,BRKa,UPDATE 1-CP wants U.S. DOJ to look into talks held by U.S. railroads,"(Reuters) - Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd urged the U.S. Department of Justice to look into statements by U.S. railroad companies about “working closely with each other to block” the company’s proposed takeover of Norfolk Southern Corp. CP’s proposed $28 billion offer to buy Norfolk Southern, disclosed in mid-November, has been spurned multiple times, setting the stage for a proxy battle. CP said in its letter to the DOJ released on Tuesday that the “collective communication strategy” adopted by rival railroads was “likely illegal because it is anticompetitive.” However, Union Pacific Corp spokesman Aaron Hunt told Reuters on Tuesday the company had “communicated with other railroads for the purpose of petitioning the government.”  “We oppose this merger and we are prepared to discuss our views with the government,” he said. Executives from U.S. railroads including UP, CSX Corp and BNSF, owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, told Reuters last week that Class I railroads had held limited discussions concerning the impact of a merger on the industry. The executives stressed that any discussions they have are strictly limited by law to subjects that affect the industry. “We’re limited on what we can discuss, which is why we had inside lawyers, outside lawyers and outside lawyer consultants,” BNSF chairman Matt Rose told Reuters last Thursday.  “It’s being done thoughtfully and it’s not secretive, it’s not clandestine. We are there discussing what the potential public policy implications of this would be.” CP reiterated in its letter that there was minimal overlap between its and Norfolk’s networks. The company “ultimately concluded the unprecedented action of major competitors organizing to block a new entrant from enhancing competition to the U.S. merited the attention of the antitrust authorities,” CP said in a statement accompanying the letter.

20,BRKa,Berkshire resumes buying Phillips 66 stock,"(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), the conglomerate run by Warren Buffett, has resumed its purchases of Phillips 66 (PSX.N) stock, and spent roughly $832 million in January to boost its stake even as the oil refiner’s profit margins narrowed. According to a regulatory filing on Friday night, Berkshire paid about $198 million this week for 2.54 million Phillips 66 shares, its first purchases of the stock since Jan. 14. For all of January, Berkshire bought 10.81 million shares, giving it 72.29 million overall, or a roughly 13.7 percent stake in Houston-based Phillips 66. Those shares were worth $5.79 billion as of Friday’s market close at $80.15. Phillips 66 is Berkshire’s sixth-largest stock holding, regulatory filings show. On Friday, Phillips 66 said quarterly net income fell 43 percent from a year earlier to $650 million, or $1.20 per share. The decline resulted in part from lower crack spreads, or the difference between the cost of oil and the price of refined products, and asset writedowns resulting from low commodity prices. Excluding items, Phillips 66 reported profit of $1.31 per share, topping analyst forecasts. Berkshire previously invested in ConocoPhillips (COP.N), which spun off Phillips 66 in 2012. In February 2014, Berkshire swapped much of its Phillips 66 stock back to the company for a chemicals business. It began rebuilding the stake early last year. Berkshire announced the new Phillips 66 purchases a few hours after the Omaha, Nebraska-based company completed its largest acquisition, a roughly $31.7 billion purchase of industrial components maker Precision Castparts Corp. Buffett has said Berkshire would spend about $23 billion of cash on that acquisition, and finance the rest.

Berkshire now owns 74.47 million Phillips 66 shares worth about $5.62 billion, based on Tuesday’s market close of $75.44. Berkshire has paid just over $77 per share for its added stake.

23,BRKa,UPDATE 1-Nevada will move all solar customers to new rates,"(Reuters) - Nevada’s utility regulator voted unanimously on Friday to require households with solar panels to move to a new, less generous rate structure, angering supporters who said existing solar owners should be able to preserve their previous rates. The new rates will be phased in over 12 years for all customers with solar panels on their rooftops. The solar industry had lobbied to have existing solar customers “grandfathered” under the current rates for at least 20 years.  The Nevada Public Utilities Commission’s move came in the wake of its decision in December to reduce the compensation solar panel owners receive when they export power they do not use back to their local utility, a policy known as net metering. The December decision sparked intense criticism by solar supporters. Opponents of net metering, which include many utilities, argue that it shifts the costs of maintaining the grid onto customers who do not have solar panels, even though solar owners also use it. NV Energy [VNEN.UL], a Nevada utility owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, proposed a variety of options for existing solar customers in its public filings, ranging from gradual changes over four years to no changes for 20 years. The commission “gave the monopoly utility more than it asked for,” said Lauren Randall, public policy manager for solar panel installer SunRun Inc. “This decision is clearly unjust and unacceptable for Nevadans. We will sue to overturn the anti-solar rules, and we will win.” NV Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In documents filed earlier this week, the commission’s staff said “the subsidy has become unreasonable,” adding that the 12-year approach would give solar owners ample time to adjust to the new rates. The December changes to net metering, the solar industry’s most important support policy, prompted SunRun, SolarCity Corp and other installers to abandon operations in the state, saying the new rates meant solar would no longer be affordable to most Nevadans. Earlier this week, SolarCity blamed the Nevada decision for a weaker-than-expected first-quarter forecast.

24,BRKa,Buffett's Berkshire raises oil bet with Kinder Morgan stake,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Tuesday disclosed a new investment in pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N), boosting its bet on the oil industry as crude prices hover near 12-year lows. Berkshire owned about 26.53 million Kinder Morgan shares worth roughly $395.9 million at year end, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing detailing its U.S.-listed stock investments. Shares of Kinder Morgan rallied in after-hours trading, rising $1.08, or 6.9 percent, to $16.70. They had closed up 66 cents at $15.62 in regular trading. It is unclear whether Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, invested in Kinder Morgan, though investments of this size are often not Buffett’s. Nonetheless, investors often view such disclosures as a signal of where Buffett and his deputies see value. Berkshire has also been boosting its stake in Phillips 66 (PSX.N), and as of Friday had spent $1.08 billion this year on the oil refiner’s stock. That gave it a 14.3 percent stake now worth about $5.91 billion. Kinder Morgan shares have fallen by nearly two-thirds since April as falling oil prices CLc1 cut into profitability. That plunge has prompted the Houston-based company to lower capital spending, and in December cut its dividend for the first time. “KMI has many of the qualities Buffett looks for in his investments, including stable, fee-based assets which generate significant amounts of cash flow,” Morningstar Inc analyst Peggy Connerty said in an email, referring to Kinder Morgan’s ticker. Given the stock price decline, and Kinder Morgan’s plan to improve its balance sheet without issuing new shares this year, “for a long-term oriented investor KMI is a decent name to own,” she said. Kinder Morgan spokeswoman Melissa Ruiz said: “We are pleased that others see the value in the company that we see.” According to Tuesday’s filing, Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) remained Berkshire’s biggest U.S. stock holding at $26.08 billion, followed by Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) at $23.69 billion. A stake in International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) declined by nearly $600 million in the quarter to $11.15 billion. Berkshire also reported boosting its share stake in Deere & Co (DE.N) and cutting its share stake in AT&T; Inc (T.N). Berkshire also owns roughly 90 businesses including the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear and Geico auto insurance.

26,BRKa,Buffett to webcast Berkshire annual meeting on Yahoo,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) plans to webcast its annual meeting for the first time, allowing the largest U.S. shareholder gathering to reach a global audience through Yahoo Inc’s YHOO.O finance page. Viewers will be able to watch Buffett, Berkshire’s 85-year-old chief executive officer, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 92, field five hours of questions on April 30 from shareholders, reporters and analysts about the Omaha, Nebraska-based company, investing, the economy and life. The webcast offers a chance “to reach more people than ever, in key financial centers” and “to bring the energy and excitement of what happens in Omaha to an informed audience around the world,” Buffett, known as the “oracle of Omaha,” said in a statement on Tuesday. The webcast may help Yahoo attract advertisers enticed by millions of potential online viewers. Yahoo’s core Internet business has struggled, and CEO Marissa Mayer has signaled she might put the business up for sale. Andy Serwer, Yahoo Finance’s editor in chief, told CNBC that Yahoo could sell ads for the live stream, and said Buffett had called him in December to ask if a webcast was possible. “He said, ‘I just want to make it bigger,’” Serwer said. “There’s a lot of demand, particularly in places like China.” Yahoo shares closed up $2.24, or 8.3 percent, at $29.28. Berkshire owns nearly 90 businesses, among which are BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, Geico car insurance and See’s candies. Most are in the United States, and the webcast could help Buffett market Berkshire to sellers of businesses elsewhere. Last year’s annual meeting drew roughly 40,000 people to Omaha to celebrate Buffett’s 50th anniversary at the helm. Attendance began to swell after Berkshire created lower-priced “B” shares in 1996, which increased the number of investors in the company. The planned webcast was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.  But even with the webcast, traveling to Omaha for Buffett’s “Woodstock for Capitalists” offers distinctive opportunities. Shareholders get discounts from Berkshire businesses and may also participate in a five-kilometer run or dine at Gorat’s steak house, a Buffett favorite. It is unclear how the webcast might affect tourism in Omaha, where Berkshire’s annual meeting is the biggest tourist draw other than the College World Series of baseball. Air fares soar and hotel rates typically double or triple. Rooms within a short walk of the meeting now fetch more than $500 a night including taxes.

Nine of the 10 major S&P; sectors were higher, led by the 1.6 percent rise in the materials sector. The benchmark S&P; 500 index staged its best two-day gain since late August over the past two days as investors snatched up beaten-down shares. Still, the S&P; 500 has fallen 7.3 percent this year due to slumping oil prices, fears of a China-led slowdown in global growth and uncertainty about central bank policies. The price of Brent crude oil, a major international benchmark, was up about 3 percent, holding onto its gains despite Iran refusing to be part of a group of top oil producers to freeze output. The agreement to stabilize production, along with the acceptance of accommodative monetary policy in Europe, relative stability in the Chinese yuan has helped calm frayed nerves globally, said Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co in Florham Park, New Jersey. “We do not see, for the moment, additional selling pressure in the coming week as market speculators absorb this much-needed mood,” Morganlander said. He expects the markets to stay in a tight trading range. At 9:39 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 136.86 points, or 0.85 percent, at 16,333.27. The S&P; 500 was up 17.49 points, or 0.92 percent, at 1,913.07 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 42.51 points, or 0.96 percent, at 4,478.47. Kinder Morgan were up 10.9 percent at $17.32 after Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a stake in the pipeline operator. Fossil was up 19.5 percent at $41.16 after the watchmaker’s quarterly results beat estimates. Priceline was 11.4 percent higher at $1,237 after the travel websites operator’s profit beat expectations. Data released on Wednesday showed that U.S. housing starts unexpectedly fell in January. A separate report showed producer prices rose last month and there were signs of an uptick in underlying producer inflation. Inflation is being watched closely for signs of whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year. Investors will get an insight on the Fed’s thinking when the minutes of the central bank’s January meeting are released at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). Fed Chair Janet Yellen has maintained that the central bank is still likely to raise rates in 2016. However, Fed funds futures suggest traders do not expect any increases this year. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,416 to 339. On the Nasdaq, 1,805 issues rose and 389 fell.

31,BRKa,UPDATE 2-Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway avoids S&P; rating downgrade,"(Reuters) - Standard & Poor’s on Friday left its “AA” credit ratings for Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) alone, saying the company’s growing diversification and “modest” financial risks meant a downgrade was not necessary. Berkshire had been put on review for a possible downgrade on Aug. 11, on concern about Buffett’s decision to deploy a large amount of cash toward last month’s $32 billion acquisition of industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp. But S&P; analyst Laline Carvalho said Berkshire’s “consistently strong” operating profitability and “exceptional” liquidity, plus the significant cash flow from its roughly 90 operating units, justify the “AA” rating, S&P;’s third highest. S&P; also affirmed Berkshire’s “A-1+” short-term credit ratings, the highest possible, and its ratings for several insurance units, including Geico and General Re. It also raised its ratings for Berkshire’s BNSF railroad. The agency also said it now analyzes Berkshire as a “corporate conglomerate” rather than as an “insurance holding company,” reflecting the growing importance of non-insurance businesses. It has a “stable” outlook for Berkshire’s ratings. “Berkshire has demonstrated the financial flexibility to generate cash from many of its operating businesses, and is not reliant as much on its insurance units as we had thought,” Carvalho said in an interview. Downgrades could have boosted Berkshire’s borrowing costs. In recent years, Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire has diversified through big purchases such as Precision Castparts, BNSF, chemical company Lubrizol and Nevada utility NV Energy. It also owns nearly 27 percent of Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), which was created last year when Kraft Foods Group and H.J. Heinz Co merged. Berkshire bought about half of Heinz in 2013. Buffett has said that excluding Kraft Heinz, Berkshire owns 10 companies large enough to be in the Fortune 500 if they were independent. While insurance units now account for only about a quarter of overall results, they help Buffett fund acquisitions and investments by providing large amounts of “float,” or the amount of premiums held before claims are paid. Insurance float totaled $86.2 billion as of Sept. 30. Berkshire ended September with $66.26 billion of cash. Buffett has said he would spend $23 billion on Precision Castparts and finance the rest. He prefers keeping a large cushion for big insurance claims. Berkshire held “triple-A” grades from all three major U.S. credit rating agencies as recently as 2009. In afternoon trading, Berkshire’s Class A shares were up $820, or 0.4 percent, at $196,845.

32,BRKa,UPDATE 1-Buffett's Berkshire avoids S&P; rating downgrade,"(Adds details from S&P; release, background, byline) By Jonathan Stempel Feb 19 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor’s on Friday left intact its “AA” credit ratings for Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, saying the company’s diversification and “modest” financial risk justify the high grade. Berkshire had been put on review on Aug. 11 for a possible downgrade on concern about Buffett’s decision to deploy a large amount of cash toward the $32 billion acquisition of industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp. But S&P; analyst Laline Carvalho said Berkshire’s ratings were supported by the Omaha, Nebraska-based company’s “excellent” profitability, “exceptional” liquidity and ability to generate significant cash flow from its roughly 90 operating businesses. S&P;’s “AA” rating is its third-highest, and its outlook for Berkshire is “stable.” It also affirmed Berkshire’s “A-1+” short-term credit ratings, the highest possible, as well as several ratings for Berkshire’s insurance units. S&P; also raised its ratings for Berkshire’s BNSF railroad unit. Downgrades could have boosted Berkshire’s borrowing costs. The company completed the Precision Castparts purchase last month. S&P; also said it now analyzes Berkshire as a “corporate conglomerate” rather than as an “insurance holding company,” reflecting the growing importance of its non-insurance businesses. Long known for owning businesses such as auto insurer Geico and reinsurer General Re, Berkshire has diversified through big acquisitions such as Precision Castparts, BNSF, chemical company Lubrizol and Nevada utility NV Energy. It also owns nearly 27 percent of Kraft Heinz Co, which was created last year from the merger of Kraft Foods Group and H.J. Heinz Co. Berkshire bought about half of Heinz in 2013. Buffett has said that excluding Kraft Heinz, Berkshire owns 10 companies large enough to be listed on the Fortune 500 if they were independent. Insurance units generate roughly one-fifth of Berkshire’s operating profit, down from the one-third or more common in the last decade. But they help Buffett fund acquisitions and investments by providing large amounts of “float,” or the amount of premiums held before claims are paid. Insurance float at Berkshire totaled $86.2 billion as of Sept. 30. Berkshire held “triple-A” grades from all three major U.S. credit rating agencies as recently as 2009.

34,BRKa,Heinz defeats claim it stole idea for Dip & Squeeze condiment packet,"By Andrew Chung Illinois inventor Scott White’s “flash of genius” to create a condiment package that could be used for squeezing or dipping is now but a flash in the pan after a U.S. appeals court on Friday agreed with H.J. Heinz Co that it should never have been granted a patent. The unanimous decision by a three-judge panel the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upholds a 2014 ruling by U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to cancel White’s patent after Heinz claimed it was not actually new compared to previously known packaging innovations. Heinz was represented by Peter Pejic of Greenblum & Bernstein.

35,BRKa,Buffett annual letter comes amid 'conspicuous' performance lag,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett will release his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders after a year when its stock price lagged the broader market by the most since 2009, adding to years of underperformance. The letter, due Saturday, is a must-read on Wall Street, filled with his thoughts on investing, life and the Omaha, Nebraska company he has run for five decades. For some, navigating the present is of primary concern, as his shares have lagged the S&P; 500 for the last several years. “His underperformance is getting conspicuous. He must address it,” said Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Investment Partners in Palm Beach, Florida, and is selling Berkshire shares short. The price of a Berkshire Class A share fell 12.5 percent in 2015, compared with a 1.4 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 including dividends, Reuters data show. That was the worst underperformance since 2009, and between 2009 and 2015, the S&P; gained about 163 percent; Berkshire, just 105 percent. Berkshire looks better when measured by book value, which looks to have gained 7.2 percent in 2015, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Meyer Shields. But since the financial crisis, it, too, has lagged the S&P; 500, based on Shields’ book value estimate.      Investors will look to see if there is any change in how Buffett views partnerships with investors such as Brazil’s 3G Capital, a cost-cutting specialist he teamed with on mergers creating Kraft Heinz Co and Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International Inc. Buffett faced questions at 2015’s meeting about 3G’s tendency to cut jobs aggressively. Berkshire now owns some 90 businesses, employing roughly 360,000 employees, including the Geico auto insurer, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, and soon, Procter & Gamble Co’s Duracell battery business. Berkshire also owns dozens of stocks. But there, two big Buffett holdings, American Express Co and International Business Machines Corp have recently been dogs. Bill Smead, who invests $2.1 billion at Smead Capital Management in Seattle, said Berkshire’s stock price looks “incredibly attractive” at close to 1.2 times book value. Buffett has said Berkshire would buy back stock at that level.    One lingering question: Who will take over in coming years, given Buffett is 85, and second-in-command Charlie Munger is 92.    Analysts expect full-year operating profit of $17.3 billion, including profit of $2,814 per share in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

36,BRKa,Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway quarterly profit jumps almost one third,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Saturday said fourth-quarter profit rose 32 percent, helped by improved results in its insurance operations and higher gains from investments and derivatives. Net income rose to $5.48 billion, or $3,333 per Class A share, from $4.16 billion, or $2,529 per share, a year earlier. Quarterly operating profit rose 18 percent to $4.67 billion, or $2,843 per share, from $3.96 billion, or $2,412 per share. Analysts on average had forecast operating profit of $2,814 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 7 percent to $51.82 billion. Book value per share, which reflects assets minus liabilities and which Buffett considers a good yardstick for Berkshire’s intrinsic worth, rose 3 percent from the end of September, to $155,501. For all of 2015, profit rose 21 percent to $24.08 billion, or $14,656 per share. The gain from the merger that created Kraft Heinz Co prevented profit from edging lower, Berkshire said. Operating profit rose 5 percent to $17.36 billion, or $10,564 per share. Buffett, 85, has run Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire for nearly 51 years. He has transformed it from a failing textile company into a conglomerate with roughly 90 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, energy, food, apparel and real estate. Buffett’s largest-ever acquisition, the $32 billion purchase of industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, closed last month. It ended the year with $71.73 billion of cash. Berkshire expects on Monday to close its acquisition of Procter & Gamble Co’s Duracell battery business, in exchange for P&G; shares that Berkshire now owns. Quarterly profit from insurance operations rose 25 percent to $1.34 billion, as improvement in reinsurance offset higher claims payouts in the Geico auto insurance unit.  Berkshire said gains from investments and derivatives quadrupled to $805 million. This in part reflected profits on stock sales and gains on long-term options contracts whose value is tied to the performance of the stock market. Profit at the BNSF railroad unit fell 9 percent to $1.08 billion, reflecting lower demand, especially in coal and some industrial products, as oil prices fell.  Buffett said BNSF’s profit could decline further in 2016. Berkshire’s insurance units ended 2015 with $87.7 billion of float, the amount of premiums held before claims are paid, Buffett said. Berkshire uses float to help fund acquisitions and other investments. The company has well over $100 billion of equity investments. Berkshire said it plans to keep its big stake in IBM Corp despite a $2.6 billion paper loss as of Dec. 31. In Friday trading, Berkshire’s Class A shares closed at $198,190.50, and its Class B shares closed at $131.92. Both are nearly unchanged this year.

37,BRKa,"Warren Buffett defends 3G, touts economy in record year for Berkshire","(Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday used his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) shareholders to launch vigorous defenses of an aggressive private equity partner and a maligned mobile home unit, as his conglomerate recorded robust profits. The world’s third-richest person and a revered investor, Buffett also injected himself into the contentious 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, lambasting candidates who talk down the nation’s economic future as “dead wrong” - an apparent jab at Republicans and frontrunner Donald Trump. Buffett, who is backing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, also raised a political issue dear to Democrats in his widely-read letter by calling climate change a “major problem for the planet,” although not one for Berkshire’s future.  Buffett, 85, also made no mention of who might succeed him at Berkshire, which he has run for a half-century, and in passing said he expects to be around at age 100. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company reported a record full-year profit of $24.08 billion, up 21 percent, while operating profit rose 5 percent to a record $17.36 billion. Fourth quarter profit was up 32 percent, and operating profit rose a larger-than-expected 18 percent. Berkshire owns roughly 90 businesses in areas as insurance, railroads, energy, food, apparel and real estate. Buffett himself is worth $62.1 billion, Forbes magazine reported. But he has critics, and spent about 10 percent of his roughly 18,000-word letter defending 3G Capital, a Brazilian firm in which Berkshire owns 51 percent of Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), and Berkshire’s Clayton Homes mobile home unit. Many shareholders questioned Buffett’s compatibility with 3G, an aggressive cost cutter led by Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann. Berkshire and 3G teamed up in 2013 to buy H.J. Heinz and last year merged it with Kraft Foods. Buffett also helped finance 3G’s merger of Burger King with Canadian donut chain Tim Hortons, creating Restaurant Brands International Inc (QSR.TO). Following these mergers, 3G slashed thousands of jobs. Buffett acknowledged that while he and 3G “follow different paths” in running businesses, 3G has been “extraordinarily successful,” and more ventures are possible. “Jorge Paulo and his associates could not be better partners,” Buffett wrote. Clayton has been faulted in articles in the Seattle Times for predatory lending and discrimination against blacks and Latinos, which the large mobile home builder denies. But Buffett called Clayton a careful lender, and said it has escaped major regulatory fines despite 65 state and federal reviews in the last two years. Management delivers “industry-leading performance,” Buffett said. Buffett praised Berkshire’s earnings power, saying that only a catastrophic cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack on the United States posed a “clear, present and enduring danger” to the company. Buffett also rejected the dour economic outlooks polluting the presidential campaign. Trump has repeatedly said the U.S. economy is in a “bubble” that he hopes will pop before he takes office. “I don’t want to inherit all this stuff,” he has said. Buffett said such concerns are overblown. “For 240 years it’s been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start,” Buffett said. “The babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history.” Buffett urged shareholders to reject a proxy proposal that would require greater disclosures about how climate change might affect Berkshire’s insurance businesses. “It seems highly likely to me that climate change poses a major problem for the planet,” Buffett wrote. “But when you are thinking only as a shareholder of a major insurer, climate change should not be on your list of worries.” Buffett touted the BNSF railroad and its leaders Matt Rose and Carl Ice, calling their $5.8 billion of capital spending to improve customer service after a poor 2014 “money well spent.” Though Buffett did not mention falling oil prices in his letter, Berkshire’s annual report said low oil prices may reduce BNSF’s profit in 2016 as industrial freight volumes decline. The report also noted Buffett’s $2.6 billion loss as of Dec. 31 in his investment in IBM Corp (IBM.N), but said Berkshire has no intention of selling the stock. Buffett also lauded the work of top insurance executives Ajit Jain and Tad Montross, and called the hiring of Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who each handle $9 billion of investments, “one of my best moves.” Combs was a driver of Berkshire’s $32 billion purchase last month of industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp. As to succession, Buffett noted his advancing age and that of vice chairman Charlie Munger, 92. But Buffett also said he plans to be around on Aug. 30, 2030, his 100th birthday, to announce that Berkshire’s Geico unit has passed State Farm as the biggest U.S. auto insurer. “Mark your calendar,” he wrote.

39,BRKa,RPT-Buffett defends Clayton Homes after critics fault its lending,"(Repeats story to add PIX to slug; no changes to text) By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK, Feb 27 (Reuters) - At last May’s annual meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Warren Buffett said he had “no apologies whatsoever” for the lending practices of the company’s Clayton Homes mobile home unit, which had been accused in a published report of predatory lending. He still doesn’t. “Kevin Clayton has again delivered an industry-leading performance,” Buffett wrote on Saturday in his widely-read letter to Berkshire shareholders, referring to Clayton’s chief executive. Buffett’s defense may add to the focus on Clayton, which generates just 2 percent of Berkshire’s profit and normally gets little notice relative to Berkshire units such as the BNSF railroad and Geico auto insurer. Still, Clayton sold more than 34,000 homes last year, and has tripled its market share since Berkshire paid $1.7 billion for it in 2003, Buffett said. Manufactured homes are often bought by people with low credit scores and incomes. Last year, the Seattle Times published reports, prepared with the Center for Public Integrity and BuzzFeed News, that said Clayton drove black, Latino and Native American borrowers into subprime loans they could not afford, and promoted a racist corporate culture, even against its own workers. The Maryville, Tennessee-based company has “categorically and adamantly” denied discriminating, and said it neither uses race and ethnicity in its lending, nor tolerates discrimination against its workers. In his letter, Buffett did not explicitly note the reports. Buffett said Clayton makes about 35 percent of all mortgage loans on manufactured homes, averaging $59,942, and keeps nearly all on its books, ensuring the need to lend carefully. Buffett quoted former U.S. Congressman Barney Frank, co-sponsor of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms, about the importance of mortgage lenders retaining the risks on for loans they make. He also said this makes Clayton different from lenders that sowed the 2008 financial crisis by making reckless loans that Wall Street later packaged into securities that were bought by investors, many of whom who should have known better. Buffett said Clayton’s diligence has enabled its $12.8-billion mortgage portfolio to perform well. He also said that diligence has been endorsed by regulators from the federal government and 25 U.S. states that have in the last two years examined Clayton 65 times. “The result? Our total fines during this period were $38,200 and our refunds to customers $704,678,” Buffett wrote. He said just 2.64 percent of Clayton’s manufactured home loans went into default last year, and 95.4 percent of borrowers were current on payments at year-end. In January, four Democratic members of the House Financial Services Committee called on the U.S. Department of Justice and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to “pursue appropriate corrective action” against Clayton.

42,BRKa,HIGHLIGHTS-Warren Buffett attacks Wall Street analysts over 'phony' earnings,"NEW YORK, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The following are excerpts from Warren Buffett’s annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc  shareholders, which was released early Saturday: “The most important development at Berkshire during 2015 was not financial, though it led to better earnings. After a poor performance in 2014, our BNSF railroad dramatically improved its service to customers last year. To attain that result, we invested about $5.8 billion during the year in capital expenditures, a sum far and away the record for any American railroad and nearly three times our annual depreciation charge. It was money well spent.” Buffett took corporate America chief executives to task for telling their shareholders to ignore certain expense items when calculating earnings such as stock-based compensation. “The very name says it all: ‘compensation.’ If compensation isn’t an expense, what is it? And, if real and recurring expenses don’t belong in the calculation of earnings, where in the world do they belong?” Buffett also said Wall Street has been enabling the practice. “Wall Street analysts often play their part in this charade, too, parroting the phony, compensation-ignoring ‘earnings’ figures fed them by managements. Maybe the offending analysts don’t know any better. Or maybe they fear losing ‘access’ to management. Or maybe they are cynical, telling themselves that since everyone else is playing the game, why shouldn’t they go along with it. Whatever their reasoning, these analysts are guilty of propagating misleading numbers that can deceive investors.” “It seems highly likely to me that climate change poses a major problem for the planet. I say ‘highly likely’ rather than ‘certain’ because I have no scientific aptitude and remember well the dire predictions of most ‘experts’ about Y2K. It would be foolish, however, for me or anyone to demand 100 percent proof of huge forthcoming damage to the world if that outcome seemed at all possible and if prompt action had even a small chance of thwarting the danger.” “With oil at low prices, we expect that volumes in 2016 will weaken compared to 2015. Freight revenues from agricultural products in 2015 increased 2 percent to approximately $4.2 billion as compared to revenues in 2014. The increase in 2015 was attributable to higher domestic grain shipments and milo exports.” “Charlie (Munger) is 92, and I am 85. If we were partners with you in a small business, and were charged with running the place, you would want to look in occasionally to make sure we hadn’t drifted off into la-la land. Shareholders, in contrast, should not need to come to Omaha to monitor how we look and sound. “Viewers can also observe our life-prolonging diet. During the meeting, Charlie and I will each consume enough Coke, See’s fudge and See’s peanut brittle to satisfy the weekly caloric needs of an NFL lineman. Long ago we discovered a fundamental truth: There’s nothing like eating carrots and broccoli when you’re really hungry - and want to stay that way.”   (Reporting By Jennifer Ablan and Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Nick Zieminski)",2272016,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-buffett-highlights/highlights-warren-buffett-attacks-wall-street-analysts-over-phony-earnings-idUSL2N1660HY
43,BRKa,UPDATE 2-Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway quarterly profit jumps almost one third,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Saturday said fourth-quarter profit rose 32 percent, helped by improved results in its insurance operations and higher gains from investments and derivatives. Net income rose to $5.48 billion, or $3,333 per Class A share, from $4.16 billion, or $2,529 per share, a year earlier. Quarterly operating profit rose 18 percent to $4.67 billion, or $2,843 per share, from $3.96 billion, or $2,412 per share. Analysts on average had forecast operating profit of $2,814 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 7 percent to $51.82 billion. Book value per share, which reflects assets minus liabilities and which Buffett considers a good yardstick for Berkshire’s intrinsic worth, rose 3 percent from the end of September, to $155,501. For all of 2015, profit rose 21 percent to $24.08 billion, or $14,656 per share. The gain from the merger that created Kraft Heinz Co prevented profit from edging lower, Berkshire said. Operating profit rose 5 percent to $17.36 billion, or $10,564 per share. Buffett, 85, has run Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire for nearly 51 years. He has transformed it from a failing textile company into a conglomerate with roughly 90 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, energy, food, apparel and real estate. Buffett’s largest-ever acquisition, the $32 billion purchase of industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, closed last month. It ended the year with $71.73 billion of cash. Berkshire expects on Monday to close its acquisition of Procter & Gamble Co’s Duracell battery business, in exchange for P&G; shares that Berkshire now owns. Quarterly profit from insurance operations rose 25 percent to $1.34 billion, as improvement in reinsurance offset higher claims payouts in the Geico auto insurance unit.  Berkshire said gains from investments and derivatives quadrupled to $805 million. This in part reflected profits on stock sales and gains on long-term options contracts whose value is tied to the performance of the stock market. Profit at the BNSF railroad unit fell 9 percent to $1.08 billion, reflecting lower demand, especially in coal and some industrial products, as oil prices fell.  Buffett said BNSF’s profit could decline further in 2016. Berkshire’s insurance units ended 2015 with $87.7 billion of float, the amount of premiums held before claims are paid, Buffett said. Berkshire uses float to help fund acquisitions and other investments. The company has well over $100 billion of equity investments. Berkshire said it plans to keep its big stake in IBM Corp despite a $2.6 billion paper loss as of Dec. 31. In Friday trading, Berkshire’s Class A shares closed at $198,190.50, and its Class B shares closed at $131.92. Both are nearly unchanged this year.

44,BRKa,"Warren Buffett defends 3G, Clayton Homes as Berkshire profit grows","Feb 27 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday launched vigorous defenses of a private equity firm and a mobile home unit that critics say employ controversial business practices antithetical to Buffett’s own at Berkshire Hathaway Inc . In his widely-read annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett said he would do more deals with 3G Capital, a Brazilian firm with which Berkshire owns a majority of Kraft Heinz Co , but which, unlike Berkshire, is known as a ruthless cost-cutter. Buffett also devoted more than 1,200 words in his roughly 18,000-word letter to defending Berkshire’s Clayton Homes unit,  after articles in the Seattle Times accused the nation’s largest mobile home builder of predatory lending and exploiting black and Latino borrowers. Berkshire reported a record full-year profit of $24.08 billion, up 21 percent from a year earlier, while operating profit rose 5 percent to a record $17.36 billion. In the fourth quarter, profit rose 32 percent to $5.48 billion, or $3,333 per Class A share. Operating profit rose 18 percent to $4.67 billion, or $2,843 per share, topping the average analyst forecast of $2,814 according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Buffett, 85, has in nearly 51 years running Berkshire transformed it from a failing textile company into a conglomerate with roughly 90 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, energy, food, apparel and real estate. His work has also made him an investing legend and the world’s third-richest person, according to Forbes magazine. But his tie-up with 3G, led by the Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann, has attracted criticism. Last year, at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, many shareholders wanted to know if Berkshire’s business principles were compatible with 3G, which has made its name as an aggressive cost-cutter that appoints its own executives and eliminates thousands of jobs at the companies it acquires. Berkshire and 3G in 2013 bought the former H.J. Heinz, and two years later merged it with the former Kraft Foods. Buffett has also helped finance 3G’s merger of Burger King with Canadian donut chain Tim Hortons. In his letter, Buffett acknowledged that while he and 3G “follow different paths” toward buying and running businesses, 3G’s method has been “extraordinarily successful”, and that more deals are possible. “Jorge Paulo and his associates could not be better partners,” Buffett wrote. “We share with them a passion to buy, build and hold large businesses that satisfy basic needs and desires.” Buffett also praised Clayton, saying that it made home ownership possible for many even during the financial crisis, and that it has to be a careful lender because it keeps the mortgage loans it makes on its books. Yet he said that in the last two years, regulators from the federal government and 25 U.S. states examined Clayton and its mortgages a total of 65 times, yet this scrutiny has led to just $38,200 of fines and $704,678 of refunds to customers. Clayton’s management still delivers “industry-leading performance,” Buffett said.

46,BRKa,Buffett says owning IBM shares could prove a mistake: CNBC,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), told CNBC on Monday the firm’s ownership of IBM (IBM.N) shares could prove a mistake and that he was buying more U.S. stocks overall since the end of last year. “We’ve owned stocks that we’ve lost money in,” said Buffett, the world’s third-richest person. “If I’m wrong, you sell them out and take a big loss. We’ve done that on a few occasions with stocks and bonds over the years.” Berkshire, which held an 8.59 percent stake in IBM as of Dec. 31, 2015, said in an annual shareholder letter on Saturday that it planned to keep that stake despite a $2.6-billion paper loss at the end of last year. Buffett told the cable television network he did not think he was wrong for owning IBM shares so far, but said it “could be” a mistake.  He said he has been wrong before, noting Berkshire’s investment in troubled British grocer Tesco PLC (TSCO.L), which he characterized as a “huge mistake” in 2014.  “I bought Tesco, it went down, and it kept going down, and I was wrong about the company,” Buffett said on Monday. Berkshire no longer has a stake in the supermarket chain. Business was a bit “softer in many places” than he had anticipated four or five months ago, Buffett said, adding that in general, stocks would advance over time. “We have bought more stocks since the end of the year,” he said.  He did not know what the consequences of sustained low interest rates globally would be, but they made all assets more valuable, Buffett said.  Buffett, who is backing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, said he had been surprised by the election season and “amazed” by Republican party developments, stating: “This takes the cake.” Buffett criticized Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, saying he has “a tendency to demonize institutions.” He weighed in on a privacy fight between Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and the U.S. government, saying privacy should trump security in smaller cases, but security should trump privacy in major cases. “If there is something major, something that the Attorney General or the head of the FBI would be willing to sign and go to a judge on and say, ‘we need this information and we need it now,’ I would be willing to trust that official,” he said. Buffett said he was a “little surprised” by Berkshire’s roughly $396 million investment in pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N), and that it was the decision of one of Berkshire’s top portfolio managers who each run $9 billion, a reference to Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.  Berkshire’s Kinder Morgan stake was revealed earlier this month in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing for the fourth quarter.  Buffett said Berkshire would likely not own Dow Chemical’s DOW.N common stock, but that he liked the company’s preferred shares.  He also said he hoped Britain would remain in the European Union and avoid a “Brexit.” ",2292016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-buffett-cnbc/buffett-says-owning-ibm-shares-could-prove-a-mistake-cnbc-idUSKCN0W21H9
47,BRKa,Berkshire's Abel sees 2015 pay surge 48 percent to $40.77 million,"(Reuters) - The energy unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Monday said Gregory Abel, its chairman and chief executive, saw his compensation jump 48 percent last year to $40.77 million, reflecting a large incentive award. Berkshire Hathaway Energy Co said Abel, 53, whom many investors view as a potential successor to Buffett as Berkshire’s chief executive, was awarded $28 million under a profit-sharing plan tied to the unit’s earnings. Abel also received a $1 million salary and an $11.5 million bonus. His pay package was disclosed in Berkshire Hathaway Energy’s annual report. Abel’s compensation in 2014 was $27.58 million, including a $12 million incentive award. The 2015 package makes Abel one of the best paid among U.S. energy executives and Berkshire’s 361,270 employees. It could also be a factor in his staying with Berkshire. In a letter to shareholders that fueled speculation about Abel’s future, Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger called Abel a “world-leading” performer who, in some ways, was a better businessman than Buffett. “If he’s that talented, he could have a host of other, extremely lucrative opportunities outside the company,” said Minor Myers, a Brooklyn Law School professor specializing in executive pay. “One goal of executive compensation is to retain people who have attractive alternative opportunities,” Myers said. “You want to keep the best people at the firm, and this may be Berkshire’s way of doing it.”  Abel has been Berkshire Hathaway Energy’s chief executive since 2008, and its chairman since 2011. He also sits on the board of the food company Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), in which Berkshire owns a 26.8 percent stake. Berkshire Hathaway Energy’s profit rose 13 percent last year to $2.37 billion, helped by higher electric and natural gas revenue and the 2014 purchase of Canada’s AltaLink electricity transmission business. The unit operates utilities in several U.S. states, natural gas pipelines, and Britain’s Northern Powergrid. Berkshire owns 89.9 percent of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and the unit accounts for 9 percent of the Omaha, Nebraska-based parent’s profit. In his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders on Saturday, Buffett said the unit’s “outstanding performances explain why BHE is welcomed by regulators when it proposes to buy a utility in their jurisdiction.” Buffett’s compensation is expected to be disclosed in March. His 2014 compensation totaled $464,011, including his usual $100,000 salary. Buffett is the world’s third-richest person, according to Forbes magazine.

56,BRKa,Buffett boosts Berkshire's Wells Fargo stake to 10 percent,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Monday said it has increased its ownership stake in Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) to 10 percent, a level that could mean increased federal scrutiny over the investment. Berkshire owns 506.3 million shares of Wells Fargo, worth about $24.7 billion, mainly through subsidiaries, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The ownership stake has risen from 6.5 percent at the end of 2009 and 9.8 percent as of Dec. 31, according to Buffett. Berkshire has paid close to $13 billion for its Wells Fargo shares, based on Buffett’s shareholder letters and the bank’s recent stock price. Wells Fargo is based in San Francisco, and is the third-largest U.S. bank by assets. “We value Berkshire Hathaway as a long-term shareholder and customer and appreciate the confidence that Berkshire’s executive team has shown in Wells Fargo,” a spokesman said. The Federal Reserve exerts special oversight when investors take large stakes in banks. In a September 2008 policy statement, the Fed said it often lets investors take double-digit bank stakes not designed to exert a “controlling influence,” but would review any resulting business relationships “case-by-case.” The U.S. Treasury Department, meanwhile, has said it will not deem a 10 percent stake to result in “control” of a big bank if the investor agrees in writing to limits on its involvement. In one of Monday’s filings, Buffett certified that Berkshire’s Wells Fargo shares “were not acquired and are not held” with the intent of changing how the bank operates. Speaking on CNBC television on Feb. 29, Buffett called Wells Fargo “a terrific operation” and said Chief Executive John Stumpf has done a “fabulous job.” As of Dec. 31, Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire also owned a 15.6 percent stake in American Express Co (AXP.N), having crossed the 10 percent threshold two decades earlier. Berkshire also operates close to 90 businesses including the Geico insurer, the BNSF railroad, various utilities and Dairy Queen ice cream.

The Federal Reserve exerts special oversight when investors take large stakes in banks. In a September 2008 policy statement, the Fed said it often lets investors take double-digit bank stakes not designed to exert a “controlling influence,” but would review any resulting business relationships “case-by-case.” The U.S. Treasury Department, meanwhile, has said it will not deem a 10 percent stake to result in “control” of a big bank if the investor agrees in writing to limits on its involvement.

59,BRKa,Chinese automaker BYD's 2015 profit surges to six-year high on green cars,"SHANGHAI, March 28 (Reuters) - Chinese automaker BYD Co Ltd  , backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, said on Monday its 2015 net profit rose more than six times over the previous year to a six-year high as green-energy car demand surged. The Shenzhen-based company reported 2.8 billion yuan  ($429.74 million) in profit, a 551 percent rise and in line with its preliminary earnings report released last month. The auto division of BYD, which is also a major producer of batteries for personal electronics, focuses on making electric and hybrid vehicles such as its best-selling Qin plug-in hybrid sedan. Sales of so-called new energy vehicles more than quadrupled last year due to aggressive government policies including subsidies, tax incentives and more leeway in awarding license plates for green cars. The government sees such vehicles as the domestic auto industry’s best shot at closing a competitive gap with more experienced global rivals and as a method to curb pollution.

The Shenzhen-based company said in a stock exchange filing that it forecast net income for January to March to increase 495 percent to 644 percent as aggressive government policies including subsidies and tax incentives continue to drive up sales. China’s slowest economic expansion in 25 years has dragged on demand for cars since last year, but green car sales more than quadrupled largely thanks to the policies. The government sees such vehicles as the domestic auto industry’s best shot at closing a competitive gap with more experienced global rivals and as a method to curb pollution. The industry will begin to transition away from government support in the future, the automaker said. “The development of new energy automobiles will be driven more by the industry’s fundamentals than government policies and will enter a phase of acceleration in full force,” BYD said. BYD said it plans to launch plug-in hybrid versions this year of its Song and Yuan sports-utility vehicles (SUV), which also play to strong sales in the SUV segment as wealthier Chinese upgrade to larger vehicles. Its first quarter earnings will follow on a 2015 net profit rising more than six times over the previous year to a six-year high. BYD reported 2.8 billion yuan ($429.74 million) in profit, a 551 percent rise and in line with its preliminary earnings report released last month.

62,BRKa,CEO of Berkshire's Gen Re to retire; Jain's role grows,"(Reuters) - General Re, one of Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s largest insurance units, said Chief Executive Officer Tad Montross is retiring, in a move that will expand the role of Ajit Jain, long viewed as a potential successor to Warren Buffett at Berkshire’s helm. Montross, 60, will step down by year end, after serving as Gen Re’s chairman and CEO since 2008, a spokeswoman for the Stamford, Connecticut-based reinsurer said. His successor has not been named, but will report to Jain, the spokeswoman said. Montross, in contrast, reports to Buffett. The change adds to the duties of Jain, 64, who has expanded the Berkshire reinsurance unit he oversees, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, even as General Re has curbed underwriting amid increased competition. Montross’ retirement was previously reported by The Insurance Insider. General Re was beset by underwriting problems for years after Buffett bought it in 1998 for roughly $16 billion. It has performed better in recent years, and Buffett said in his annual shareholder letter in February it was now a “gem.” Reinsurers provide protection for traditional insurers. Berkshire owns some 90 businesses including energy companies, food and clothing companies, and a railroad, and well over $100 billion in common stocks. It generates power to invest and make acquisitions from “float,” or the amount of insurance premiums collected before claims are paid.  General Re contributed $18.6 billion of float to Berkshire’s overall $87.7 billion total as of year end, while Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance contributed $44.1 billion. A majority of the remainder came from the auto insurer Geico. Buffett’s successor as Berkshire’s CEO remains a mystery, though the 85-year-old has said the board of his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate has internal candidates.

The disruption was due to a power outage at a third party co-location facility, Chief Operating Officer Richard Deleo said in an emailed statement. The outage was not related to a cyber attack, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Business Wire’s feed went down just before the U.S. stock market closed, with the last release reaching Reuters at 3:44 p.m. ET. The feed at Reuters resumed at 07:15 p.m. ET. Business Wire’s system is fully operational again, Richard Deleo, Chief Operating Officer of the company said in a statement. For most of that time, Business Wire’s website carried a message that read, “The Business Wire site is currently unavailable, but will be back shortly.” It asked users to access news releases via Yahoo Finance and other websites. Business Wire handles the press release dissemination for thousands of companies, including more than half the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Alcoa Chief Executive Klaus-Christian Kleinfeld told CNBC on Monday that the glitch at Business Wire had delayed the release of the metal company’s quarterly earnings report, which marks the unofficial beginning of earnings season. Many companies such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Twitter Inc have moved away from using the services of companies such as Business Wire and its peer PR Newswire Association LLC, choosing instead to release their statements on their websites or through social media.

Prior to taking over Berkshire on May 10, 1965, Buffett had planned to sell back his shares in what was then a struggling textile company. But he got angry when the term sheet showed a price 12-1/2 cents a share less than he agreed to. He responded by buying all the shares he could, until he won control. Fifty-one years later, Berkshire is an energy, insurance, manufacturing, railroad, retailing and investment empire with close to 90 companies, well over $100 billion of common stock investments, and a market value around $364 billion. The following comes from Berkshire and other sources. -2015 net income: $24.08 billion, up 21 percent from 2014 -2015 operating income: $17.36 billion, up 5 percent from 2014 -2015 revenue: $210.82 billion, up 8 percent from 2014 -Stock price: $221,430 per Class A share as of April 27, 2016, roughly 3 percent below its December 2014 peak.

The Shenzhen-based company forecast a 382 percent to 425 percent rise in net profit for the first half to 2.25 billion to 2.45 billion yuan ($347.29 million-$378.16 million), according to stock exchange filings. For the first quarter, BYD reported 851 million yuan  ($131.35 million) in profit, a seven-fold increase year-on-year and in line with its forecast last month of a 495 percent to 644 percent rise. The automaker reported a similarly large rise for 2015 full-year net profit last month as overall new-energy vehicle sales in China more than quadrupled thanks to aggressive government policies including subsidies, tax incentives and more leeway in awarding license plates for green cars. That surge has carried through to this year with sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles doubling in the first quarter.

Buffett responded to a question about whether he agreed with his right-hand man, Charlie Munger, who last year called Valeant’s core strategy of buying smaller pharmacies and then raising prices of their drugs “deeply immoral.” Buffett implied that Valeant was similar, in some respects, to “chain letter” companies designed to fool investors. Shares in Valeant have lost 87 percent of their value from their 2015 high, and its former chief executive was called to testify before Congress this week about the company’s drug-pricing policies. Buffett said the Sequoia Fund, which traces its roots to Buffett, took an “unusually large position” in Valeant, mainly a result of the fund becoming “overly entranced with the business model.” Sequoia, which at one point had more than 30 percent of its assets in Valeant, had 19 percent of its money in the drug stock as of Dec. 31. Buffett noted the money manager responsible for Sequoia’s investment in Valeant, then-chief executive Robert Goldfarb, has left the fund. Buffett said he also was approached by multiple people asking if he wanted to invest in Valeant and meet former Valeant CEO Michael Pearson. Buffett said he declined to do either of those things, and was wary of the company from the very beginning. All told, Buffett expressed support for portfolio managers of the Sequoia, which has long invested in Berkshire and shared similar values, characterizing them as “very smart, decent people.” Munger concurred that Sequoia “reconstituted” itself. He added: “We think the whole thing is fixed. Valeant was a sewer, and those who created it deserved the opprobrium they got.” Friday, Sequoia said in a regulatory filing that the $5.3 billion mutual fund is reopening to new investors. It will accept direct purchases from new customers but remains closed to those seeking to buy through intermediaries.

Hedge fund manager William Ackman, among others, has said he would not own Coke stock. But Buffett, 85, noted that he consumes about 700 calories of Coke a day, saying “I’m about one-quarter Coca-Cola,” and that he had seen no evidence that switching to “water and broccoli” would make it easier for him to make it to age 100. “I elect to get my 2,600 or 2,700 calories a day from things that make me feel good when I eat them.

74,BRKa,Buffett defends Berkshire's big Coke stake,"OMAHA, Neb., April 30 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday vigorously defended Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s   large, long-standing investment  in Coca-Cola Co, rejecting critics who say the company’s sugary drinks harm people’s health. Speaking at Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett said it seemed “spurious” to argue that calories from Coke alone were a significant factor in obesity levels. Hedge fund manager William Ackman, among others, has said he would not own Coke stock. But Buffett, 85, noted that he consumes about 700 calories of Coke a day, saying “I’m about one-quarter Coca-Cola,” and that he had seen no evidence that switching to “water and broccoli” would make it easier for him to make it to age 100. “I elect to get my 2,600 or 2,700 calories a day from things that make me feel good when I eat them. That’s my sole test,” he said. “I like fudge a lot. Peanut brittle. I am a very, very, very happy guy.” Berkshire owns 400 million shares of Coke, about 9 percent of the company.

75,BRKa,Buffett says Berkshire 'fine' with Trump or Clinton,"OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Warren Buffett said on Saturday that Berkshire Hathaway Inc is poised to do well no matter who wins the White House in November, and the billionaire investor defended the performance and tactics of the conglomerate’s several large investments. Buffett presided over his 51st Berkshire annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, where he and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger fielded five hours of questions on such matters as Coca-Cola’s sugary drinks, lower shipping volumes on the BNSF railroad, risks from derivatives, and who might succeed Buffett as chief executive. Buffett, a staunch supporter of Democrat Hillary Clinton for president, was asked about the regulatory impact on Berkshire if Republican front-runner Donald Trump wins the 2016 U.S. presidential election. “That won’t be the main problem,” he said to audience laughter.  “If either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton becomes president, and one of them is very likely to be, I think Berkshire will continue to do fine.” Because the meeting fell early this year, Berkshire also released only preliminary first-quarter results rather than full results, which will come out on May 6. Berkshire said net income probably rose 8 percent, helped by a gain from the swap of Procter & Gamble Co stock for the Duracell battery business. Operating profit probably fell 12 percent, however. Buffett said BNSF was hurt by declining oil prices and coal shipments, while hailstorms caused losses in Berkshire insurance units. “Railroad carloading throughout the industry - all of the major railroads - were down significantly in the first quarter, and probably almost certainly will continue to be down for the balance of the year,” Buffett said. Berkshire owns close to 90 businesses in energy, insurance, manufacturing, railroad, retail and other sectors, and invests well over $100 billion in stocks.  The meeting filled a downtown arena and overflow rooms, and shareholders could buy products made by Berkshire units at deep discounts in an exhibit hall. Buffett suggested that 40,000 people may have shown up for his “Woodstock for Capitalists,” close to last year’s record, though the meeting was streamed online for the first time. At the meeting, Buffett and Munger fielded dozens of questions from shareholders, analysts and journalists. A shareholder proposal for more disclosures on the risks to Berkshire on climate change was overwhelmingly rejected. Buffett parried concerns raised by a shareholder, and previously by hedge fund manager William Ackman, that Berkshire promotes bad health through its roughly 9-percent stake in Coca-Cola Co. Buffett, who consumes 700 calories of Coke a day, said it seemed wrong to blame calories alone for rising obesity levels. “I elect to get my 2,600 or 2,700 calories a day from thingsthat me feel good when I eat them,” he said, including the Cherry Coke and See’s peanut brittle he consumed during the meeting. “That’s my sole test.” Buffett also renewed his defense of Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital, which with Berkshire has a controlling stake in  food company Kraft Heinz Co, where it has built on its reputation as a ruthless cost-cutter. Berkshire is seen as a friendlier owner, but Buffett said 3G’s cuts have been “extremely intelligent,” and did not appear a threat to Kraft Heinz’s ability to produce packaged goods. Buffett also defended efforts of Berkshire’s NV Energy unit to persuade Nevada regulators to reduce subsidies for homeowners there who use solar power, prompting Elon Musk’s SolarCity Corp to say it would cease activity there. “Ninety-nine percent of our consumers were being asked to subsidize the one percent that had solar units,” Buffett said. “I personally think that if society is the one that’s benefiting from the reduction of greenhouse gasses, that society should pick up the tab.” Buffett also emphasized his worry that derivatives could cause major risks for most of the world’s largest banks if markets were disrupted. “It is still a potential time bomb,” he said, but added that he was “not in the least troubled” by Berkshire’s big stakes in Wells Fargo & Co and Bank of America Corp. Buffett also said Geico has been hurt because falling oil prices led to more driving, more accidents and more loss claims, but said he did not “necessarily see the same trends this year.” He also said there are no “tea leaves” in the recent announcement that the next chief of the General Re reinsurance unit will report to Buffett’s insurance lieutenant Ajit Jain, not to Buffett. Some investors believe Jain is a top candidate to succeed Buffett as Berkshire’s chief executive. EARLY WAKE-UP Buffett also said Mark Donegan, chief executive of Precision Castparts, which Berkshire bought in January for $32 billion, may now fare even better now that his company has the support from Berkshire’s deep well of capital. “I would almost rank Mark as one of a kind,” Buffett said, before joking: “If he needs capital, he’s got my 800 number.” Shareholders at the meeting included hundreds who waited hours in a rainstorm before doors opened at 6:20 a.m., 40 minutes early. “I wanted to make sure I got a good seat,” said Kim Baumler, an office manager for a wealth management company from Fargo, North Dakota, who said she was at the head of the line at 10:30 p.m. Friday night. “My boss is a huge Warren Buffett follower, and I got hooked. I wanted to see what it was all about.” Mark Hughes, a money manager from Ashton, Maryland attending his 25th meeting, said he sees no sign Buffett and Munger are winding down. “They’re 85 and 92, and look as good as they ever did,” he said.

76,BRKa,Warren Buffett says more likely to buy IBM shares than sell: CNBC,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, said Monday he would be more likely to buy than sell IBM shares over the next two years, and that he did not seek to profit from global central bank actions.  Buffett, who presided over Berkshire’s 51st annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska over the weekend, told cable television network CNBC: “We would be much more likely to buy more in the next 12 or 24 months than we would be to sell shares, but we will make that call as time goes along.” Buffett, whose Berkshire held an 8.59 percent stake in IBM as of the end of last year and who has caught some flak for his stake, said his cost basis in IBM was around $170 a share and that he had still never sold a share.  IBM shares fell 0.4 percent to $145.34 late Monday afternoon.  Buffett also said he did not seek to profit from global central bank monetary policies, but that low and negative interest rates could produce an unanticipated reaction.  “It’s a fascinating movie to watch. I don’t try to make money off the movie,” Buffett said.  “If currency in a bank is worth less than currency in your hands or in a mattress, that could produce something in the way of behavior that nobody has ever anticipated.” Buffett, whose Berkshire is an American Express shareholder, said the company’s loss of its contract with retailer Costco Wholesale Corp was “significant” but he agreed with American Express Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault’s decision to split from Costco.  He said American Express would remain “under attack” from alternative payment methods, but he was confident in his stake.  “Costco was a very, very, very valuable co brand to have for American Express, but that value wasn’t limitless,” he said.  Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger told CNBC, however, that he would have made the opposite decision with regard to American Express’s contract with Costco.  Buffett also criticized companies that repurchase their own shares at too high a price: “They have in mind a limit as to what they pay for any business they buy except their own, and it has become fashionable to repurchase shares.” Buffett, who has ordered that most of the money he is not giving away at his death should be placed in an index fund, also said active investing as a whole was “certain” to produce worse-than-average results.  Buffett and Munger added to previous criticisms they have made of embattled drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc’s drug-price hikes.  Buffett said there “really wasn’t any defense” for Valeant’s price hikes, while Munger said Valeant was “leading the pack” of certain industry players who were raising prices dramatically. “I don’t think you’d want your son to grow up and run a company in the manner that Valeant was run,” Buffett said.  Munger said he suspected it was “massively stupid” for the U.S. government to rely heavily on printing money and lightly on fiscal stimulus for infrastructure, and that the United States would have been better off with more fiscal stimulus.

77,BRKa,Big bargains entice Warren Buffett fans on Berkshire weekend,"OMAHA (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, is known for his keen eye for a bargain. And there were plenty on offer for shareholders attending  Berkshire’s annual meeting over the weekend, where goods from some 50 Berkshire businesses were on show, often at big discounts. Shareholder Shelli Clausen thought a $5 kitchen spatula from Berkshire’s Pampered Chef business fit the bill. “It’s a good buy, and it’s fun to get the good deals,” she said while waiting in a line a couple of hundred deep in downtown Omaha’s CenturyLink Center, where Buffett had addressed shareholders and taken questions.    When not listening to the Oracle of Omaha and his partner Charlie Munger, shareholders had two days to browse and buy Berkshire’s products.    These included See’s Candies peanut brittle that Buffett and Munger chomped during the meeting.      Courtney Cohen, a sales director at See’s Candies, estimated that 19,000 of the 22,956 pounds of candy that the company brought to the meeting were sold. Dairy Queen events manager Dean Peters said those shareholders needing an ice cream fix consumed about 28,000 of its Dilly, Vanilla Orange and Fudge bars and its Mini Oreo Blizzards. Those with more to spend could buy a $9,277 pair of white gold diamond stud earrings from Borsheim’s jewelry. Some vendors said numbers seemed down on in 2015, when Buffett celebrated his 50th anniversary running Berkshire.     Official attendance was not immediately known, but this year’s meeting was the first to be streamed online.      This was widely cited as a reason Omaha may have attracted fewer people to the weekend of events that Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists.” Buffett said on CNBC on Monday that he thought attendance was down by 10 percent.     Among the other Berkshire businesses on show were Kirby vacuum cleaners sold through in-home demonstrations and Fruit of the Loom clothing brand, which was among the more popular items. Fruit of the Loom had to put up a barrier at one stage to stop shareholders from overwhelming staff selling its $8 neon green “Berky Boxer” shorts, or the bright yellow 2015 edition for just $3.    “It’s packed, incredibly packed,” first-time attendee Steve Peters, from nearby Papillion, Nebraska, said. He and his wife Marlene had just bought a bed from Nebraska Furniture Mart and jackets from Fechheimer Brothers.     “There are good deals,” Marlene Peters said.  Just what Buffett would want his shareholders to say.

78,BRKa,"Berkshire operating profit falls short, book value rises","(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Friday confirmed that its first-quarter profit rose 8 percent, while operating results fell short of analyst forecasts as falling oil prices and coal demand hurt its BNSF railroad unit. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate, which has close to 90 operating units, also said its book value per share, measuring assets minus liabilities and Buffett’s preferred gauge of growth, rose 1.2 percent from year end. Net income rose to $5.59 billion, or $3,401 per Class A share, from $5.16 billion, or $3,143 per share, a year earlier. Operating profit fell 12 percent to $3.74 billion, or $2,274 per Class A share, from $4.24 billion, or $2,583 per share. Analysts on average had expected operating profit of about $2,759 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, before Berkshire released preliminary results at its annual meeting in Omaha on April 30. Results suffered as falling oil prices and lower demand for coal contributed to a 25 percent drop in profit at BNSF to $784 million, as overall volume fell 5.5 percent. Freight revenue from industrial products such as petroleum fell 18 percent, and from coal tumbled 39 percent. Railroad carloadings industrywide fell “significantly” in the first quarter, and “almost certainly will continue to be down the balance of the year,” Buffett said at the meeting. Buffett also said insurance results suffered from payouts related to Texas hailstorms. Insurance underwriting profit fell 56 percent to $213 million despite improvement at the Geico auto insurer, which raised premiums to offset rising accident claims. “Float,” which is the amount of insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and helps fund Berkshire’s expansion, grew to about $89 billion from $87.7 billion in the quarter. Book value per share rose to $157,369 per Class A share as of March 31 from $155,501 three months earlier, while revenue rose 8 percent from a year earlier to $52.4 billion. Berkshire made two big acquisitions in the quarter. It acquired airplane parts maker Precision Castparts for about $32.1 billion, and acquired battery maker Duracell from Procter & Gamble Co in exchange for that company’s stock. The swap resulted in a $1.9 billion after-tax gain. Among other businesses, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility unit mostly owned by Berkshire, posted a 5 percent increase in profit to $441 million, as lower energy costs helped boost margins at its Western U.S. electric utility PacifiCorp. Berkshire also has dozens of smaller units that sell such things as Benjamin Moore paint, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, Johns Manville insulation and See’s candies. The company ended the quarter with $58.34 billion of cash, down from $71.73 billion at year end, largely because of Precision Castparts. It also owns $106.4 billion of stocks such as International Business Machines Corp, which it plans to keep despite sitting on a $1.5 billion unrealized loss as of March 31. Berkshire owns 26.8 percent of Kraft Heinz Co, and with Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital has a controlling stake in the food company. Kraft Heinz on Wednesday posted a larger-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by cost cuts as some shoppers seek out fresher alternatives to its packaged, processed foods. In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares closed up 0.5 percent at $216,999.99, and its Class B shares closed up 0.5 percent at $144.62, according to Reuters data.

It said the customers “include or may include parties that meet the definition of the ‘Government of Iran.’” The transactions took place from June 2013 to November 2015, and generated about $2,500 of profit on $45,000 of revenue, Berkshire said.

In an internal memo issued on Thursday and obtained by Reuters, Jain said Raiguel has been a “key player” at his reinsurance division for more than 15 years, his “secret weapon” for 10 years, and a “true renaissance woman in the insurance and reinsurance industry.” Jain highlighted her work including the creation of a large California workers’ compensation program, and a foray into India’s reinsurance market. Montross had been chairman and CEO of Stamford, Connecticut-based General Re since 2008, and reported directly to Buffett. Raiguel was not immediately available for comment. The memo was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal. Reinsurers provide protection for traditional insurers. Berkshire paid about $16 billion for General Re in 1998 and after initial struggles the unit has performed better recently. Buffett nonetheless warned on April 30 at Berkshire’s annual meeting that the industry will fare less well in the next decade as more investors enter the business and push prices down. In the memo, Jain agreed that the industry faces “serious headwinds.” He said Raiguel’s first priority in the next 90 days is to decide how best to add business without sacrificing underwriting discipline and business integrity. Berkshire owns some 90 businesses including energy companies, food and clothing companies, and a railroad. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company has become less reliant on insurance and reinsurance as it diversifies, but generates much of its power to invest and make acquisitions from “float,” the amount of insurance premiums collected before claims are paid.

93,BRKa,Auction for Warren Buffett charity lunch starts slow,"(Reuters) - The annual charity auction for a private lunch with billionaire investor Warren Buffett is underway. The top bid to dine with the chairman of the conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) was $200,100 at 12 p.m. EDT on Monday, but will likely surge by the time the auction on eBay (EBAY.O) ends on Friday night. Winning bids have reached seven figures every year since 2008, with the record $3,456,789 offer submitted anonymously in 2012. Last year’s winner paid $2,345,678. Auction proceeds go to Glide, a charity in San Francisco’s Tenderloin district that provides food, health care and other services to people who are homeless, poor or struggling with substance abuse. Buffett has raised about $20.2 million in 16 auctions for Glide. “Mr. Buffett has been just one of the most important people in our work,” Rev. Cecil Williams, 86, Glide’s co-founder and a pastor at Glide Memorial United Methodist Church, told Reuters. “If people didn’t respond to places like Glide, we would be in serious trouble in urban America.” Buffett, 85, is the world’s third richest person, worth $66.8 billion, Forbes magazine said on Monday. He is donating virtually all of his wealth to charity. The auction was created by Buffett’s first wife, Susan, and continued after her 2004 death. It began on Sunday night, and will end at 10:30 p.m. EDT Friday. The winner and up to seven friends can dine with Buffett at the Smith & Wollensky steak house in Manhattan. Past winners have included David Einhorn, the Greenlight Capital hedge fund manager, and Ted Weschler, now a portfolio manager at Berkshire. Bids for the private lunch have stayed high even as Buffett’s visibility has grown over the years, including the first-ever webcast of Berkshire’s annual meeting in April. With a $17 million budget, Glide provides an estimated 750,000 free meals, 815,000 syringes, emergency shelter for 8,700 people, and day care and afterschool programs for 450 children each year. “I am proud to be part of something that has directly benefited so many people in need,” Buffett said in a statement. Williams said Buffett talks with him a few times a year, about Glide and whatever else is on their minds. “It is a relationship that we have,” Williams said. “He’s very jovial, open and a lot of fun, but he’s also very serious.” According to Glide, the following are the winning bids in past auctions: 2000: Pete Budlong, $25,000 2001: Jim Halperin and Scott Tilson, $20,000 2002: Jim Halperin and Scott Tilson, $25,000 2003: David Einhorn, Greenlight Capital, $250,100 2004: Jason Choo, Singapore, $202,100 2005: Anonymous, $351,100 2006: Yongping Duan, California, $620,100 2007: Mohnish Pabrai, Guy Spier, Harina Kapoor, $650,100 2008: Zhao Danyang, Pure Heart Asset Management, China, $2,110,100 2009: Courtenay Wolfe, Salida Capital, Canada, $1,680,300 2010: Ted Weschler, $2,626,311 2011: Ted Weschler, $2,626,411 2012: Anonymous, $3,456,789 2013: Anonymous, $1,000,100 2014: Andy Chua, Singapore, $2,166,766 2015: Zhu Ye, Dalian Zeus Entertainment Co, China, $2,345,678 ",6062016,http://www.reuters.com/article/buffett-lunch/auction-for-warren-buffett-charity-lunch-starts-slow-idUSL1N18Y0GR
94,BRKa,"Kraft, Mondelez must face wheat price-rigging lawsuit: U.S. judge","(Reuters) - A federal judge in Chicago on Monday refused to dismiss a lawsuit in which wheat futures and options traders accused Kraft Heinz Co and Mondelez International Inc of illegally manipulating the grain’s price at their expense. U.S. District Judge Edmond Chang said traders may pursue claims that a large and, in their view, unnecessary late 2011 purchase by Kraft Foods Inc of wheat futures contracts violated the Sherman antitrust law and the Commodity Exchange Act. In a 66-page decision, Chang also dismissed claims that the defendants conducted offsetting “wash trades” over roughly a decade to create an illusion of greater market activity. He said the traders can try to bring those claims again. Kraft and Mondelez were named as defendants because most of the alleged suspicious activity occurred before Kraft Foods Inc split in two in 2012. Mondelez brands now include snack foods such as Oreos, Ritz crackers and Wheat Thins. Many of the allegations were similar to those raised by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in an April 2015 lawsuit against Kraft and Mondelez. A Kraft Heinz spokesman and a Mondelez spokeswoman declined to comment on the decision. Vincent Briganti, a lawyer for the traders, said he was pleased the court found “multiple viable claims.” The CFTC said Kraft Foods bought $90 million of December 2011 wheat futures, giving it a dominant position in that market, despite never intending to take possession of the grain. It said Kraft Foods did so to depress prices in the cash wheat market, because sellers might believe the company needed less wheat, and inflate futures prices. It said the strategy led to more than $5.4 million of illegal profit. Last December, another judge rejected a defense motion to  dismiss the CFTC lawsuit. Both companies have said Mondelez expects to bear most costs from that case. Mondelez believes any court-ordered fine or settlement would not be material to investors, the company spokeswoman said. Kraft merged last year with H.J. Heinz Co to create Kraft Heinz, whose products include Kraft cheese, Heinz ketchup, Oscar Mayer deli meats and Maxwell House coffee. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc owns a roughly 26.8 percent stake in Kraft Heinz.    The case is Ploss v.

96,BRKa,Berkshire seeks to boost its Wells Fargo stake above 10 percent,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) is seeking permission from the Federal Reserve to increase its ownership stake in Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), after reaching the 10 percent level that could prompt increased regulatory scrutiny. According to papers obtained by Reuters on Friday, Berkshire said it learned in mid-March that its Wells Fargo stake, including 2.01 million shares held by Buffett, had reached 10.01 percent because of buybacks by the San Francisco-based bank, which decreased the number of shares outstanding. Though the stake later dipped to 9.97 percent, Berkshire said it has again risen above 10 percent because of more buybacks by Wells, which is the third-largest U.S. bank by assets. Berkshire said it has bought no Wells Fargo shares since Oct. 21. “Berkshire is seeking permission to retain its current ownership position in Wells Fargo and to acquire additional shares of common stock of Wells Fargo for investment purposes,” according to the papers, which were dated June 14 and submitted to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. The Federal Reserve exerts special oversight when investors take large bank stakes. Berkshire said it had no dollar value in mind for purchases, had no plans to make significant changes to Wells Fargo’s strategy or corporate structure, and was not contemplating changes to the bank’s management or board. Bloomberg News earlier reported the paperwork. Berkshire’s investment in Wells Fargo is worth more than $23 billion. “We value Berkshire Hathaway as a long-term shareholder and customer, and we appreciate the confidence that Berkshire’s executive team has shown,” Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez said an email. Buffett has long been a supporter of Wells Fargo, calling it “very well run” and a “terrific operation,” and saying that Chief Executive John Stumpf has done a “fabulous job.” The Federal Reserve exerts special oversight when investors take large bank stakes. In a September 2008 policy statement, the Fed said it often lets investors take double-digit stakes not designed to exert a “controlling influence,” but would review any resulting business relationships “case-by-case.” The U.S. Treasury Department has said it will not deem a 10 percent stake to result in “control” of a big bank if an investor agrees in writing to limits on its involvement. Berkshire also owns 15.94 percent of American Express Co (AXP.N), the application and Reuters data show. Based in Omaha, Nebraska, Berkshire also operates close to 90 businesses such as auto insurer Geico, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream and various apparel, energy and industrial companies.

102,BRKa,Berkshire unit to buy large New York medical insurer MLMIC,"(Reuters) - A Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) unit has agreed to buy Medical Liability Mutual Insurance Co, expanding billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s business of protecting doctors, dentists and other healthcare professionals against lawsuits. MLMIC is the largest underwriter of medical professional liability insurance in New York, Berkshire’s National Indemnity Co unit said in a joint statement on Monday announcing the purchase. Terms were not disclosed, but MLMIC said its policy holders’ surplus, a measure of assets minus liabilities, was about $1.8 billion at the end of 2015. The purchase is expected to close in the current quarter, pending regulatory approvals. In the statement, Buffett, who is Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive, called MLMIC “a gem of a company that has protected New York’s physicians, mid-level providers, hospitals and dentists like no other for over 40 years.” Berkshire has roughly 90 operating businesses in several sectors, but remains best known for insurance operations such as the Geico auto insurer, the General Re reinsurer, and a business that provides coverage against major catastrophes. In 2005, Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire bought Medical Protective Co, a century-old medical malpractice insurer based in Indiana. MedPro later bought Princeton Insurance Co, which insures healthcare professionals in New Jersey, from MLMIC. Last year it bought PLICO, which provides similar coverage in Oklahoma. Buffett has said he has been “absolutely delighted” with those purchases, after having called malpractice insurance “a graveyard for many insurers” in 2006. MLMIC on its website said it would convert to a stock company from a mutual company owned by policy holders.

Balanced against these strengths are increasing debt levels, declining interest  coverage and general earnings volatility risk given BRK's material exposures to  equity markets, insured natural catastrophes and asbestos and environmental  retroactive reinsurance. BRK's acquisition strategy brings additional risks  including potential earnings volatility and increased financial leverage.  BRK reported net income of $5.6 billion for the first quarter of 2016 or an 8.7%  annualized return on equity, up modestly from $5.2 billion and 8.6% in the  comparable period of 2015.  The bottom line result masked weakness in earnings  from both insurance operations and Burlington Northern and Santa Fe (BNSF). The insurance operations accounted for a little more than one-quarter of BRK's  $5.7 billion in pre-tax earnings allocated to operating segments, which was the  largest contributor along with manufacturing through the first quarter of 2016.  Growth in earnings from the manufacturing segment reflects the acquisition of  Precision Castparts Corp. (PCC).   BRK's insurance group reported $1.5 billion in earnings before tax in the first  quarter of 2016, down from $1.8 billion in the comparable period in 2015.   Worsening trends in BRK's property/casualty reinsurance business were primarily  responsible for deteriorating profitability in BRK's insurance segment.  Pre-tax earnings from BNSF railroad operations deteriorated during the first  quarter of 2016 to $1.3 billion, down from $1.7 billion in the comparable  quarter of 2015 due to declines in unit volume.  Fitch expects BNSF's  profitability for the remainder of 2015 to be squeezed by lower freight volumes  attributable to a softening demand for energy related products such as oil and  coal that will be partially offset by reduced plans for capital expenditures.  BRK's GAAP basis earnings will continue to be exposed to accounting earnings  volatility given the large notional values and long duration of BRK's  outstanding derivative contracts. Additionally, Fitch believes that BRK's  earnings will be exposed to potential volatility from the company's reinsurance  businesses and its exposure to catastrophe-related losses as well as the  company's large equity investment portfolio. BRK maintained excellent financial flexibility despite a decline in cash and  equivalents to $58 billion at March 31, 2016 from $71 billion at year-end 2015  following the acquisition of PCC and additional investments in various common  stocks. At March 31, 2016, BRK's subsidiaries in aggregate had approximately  $9.2 billion in available capacity under lines of credit and commercial paper  with $4.4 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. BRK's consolidated financial leverage ratio (FLR) was 28.0% as of March 31,  2016, up from 24.6% at year-end 2015 following the PCC acquisition. The  consolidated FLR includes $58 billion of debt attributable to BRK's Railroad,  Utilities and Energy business. Fitch expects these major non-insurance  businesses will service their own debt.  An alternate calculation of BRK's financial leverage ratio, using holding  company debt and debt issued by the finance operations and guaranteed by BRK,  was 20.5% at March 31, 2016. The agency views BRK's ability to fund finance  operations at a low cost as an important competitive advantage for the finance  operations and also notes that much of the finance company debt is guaranteed by  BRK. Consolidated interest coverage for the first three months of 2016 was 5.6x,  excluding the impact from realized investment gains and derivative gains, which  is down from 8.0x for the full year 2015 and below Fitch's expectations of 12x  for companies at BRK's rating level. An alternate calculation of interest  coverage, excluding railroad, utilities and energy, was 8.3x during the first  three months of 2016. The deterioration in the interest coverage ratio is  attributable to additional debt from the PCC acquisition. Following the acquisition of PCC, BRK is approaching Fitch's tolerances on  financial leverage and interest coverage. Consequently, another material  acquisition similarly or more aggressively financed than the PCC acquisition  would place downward pressure on BRK's ratings. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to a future downgrade include: --Deterioration in the credit quality of key insurance subsidiaries (National  Indemnity, GenRe, and GEICO) that is no longer consistent with the current 'AA+'  rating. Measures of credit quality include Fitch's judgment of capitalization, a  total financing and commitments ratio greater than 1.5x, net leverage (excluding  affiliated investments) over 3.5x or a sharp and persistent reduction in  underwriting profits.  --A consolidated run-rate debt-to-total capital ratio that exceeds 30% or a  run-rate debt-to-total capital ratio from the holding company, insurance and  finance operations (including debt issued or guaranteed by the holding company)  that exceeds 25%. --Material increases in leveraged equity market exposure such as its equity  index put derivative portfolio.   --Acquisitions or other actions that reduce outstanding cash below $10 billion  or approximately 5x consolidated interest expense.    Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: --A commitment to lower debt-to-tangible capital ratios attributed to the  holding company, insurance and finance operations. Fitch believes that this  would likely require the scaling back of the finance operations.

106,BRKa,Berkshire unit to insure representations in corporate mergers,"(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) plans to begin insuring representations and warranties in mergers and other corporate transactions in the United States and Canada, the latest expansion of a fast-growing unit that Chairman and Chief Executive Warren Buffett has been building since 2013. The unit, Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance, on Tuesday said it hired Robert Underhill as senior vice president and head of its transactional liability business. Underhill was previously a partner at U.S. law firm Locke Lord focusing on insurance mergers and acquisitions, reinsurance and other insurance transactional and regulatory matters. Representations and warranties insurance can protect buyers and sellers from losses resulting from inaccuracies in documentation for their transactions, and can increase the prospect the transactions will eventually close. The Berkshire unit plans to offer primary and excess coverage. Buffett set up BHSI in 2013 to enable Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire to insure commercial property and casualty risks. BHSI has expanded rapidly, generating more than $1 billion of annual premiums, and adding offices in Europe, Asia and Australia. The unit on Tuesday also said it appointed Dan Crosby as vice president of transactional liability, and Amy Bowman and Michael Brooks as assistant vice presidents.

112,BRKa,"Bezos passes Buffett, becomes third-richest person: Forbes","(Reuters) - Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), has become the world’s third-richest person as of the market close for the first time, Forbes magazine said, passing Warren Buffett, the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N). Bezos’ fortune was $65.3 billion as of 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT) on Thursday, compared with Buffett’s $64.9 billion. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) co-founder Bill Gates remained the world’s richest person, at $77.7 billion, while Spain’s Amancio Ortega, who founded the Zara clothing chain’s owner Inditex SA (ITX.MC), was second at $72.7 billion. Facebook Inc (FB.O) co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was fifth, at $54 billion. Bezos, 52, owns close to 18 percent of Amazon. Its stock has risen by roughly 50 percent since early February, as the world’s largest online retailer continued to upend retailing as more people took to the Web rather than the mall to shop. Amazon’s share price rose further in after-hours trading, after the Seattle-based company reported better-than-expected second-quarter results. Buffett, 85, owns close to 18 percent of Berkshire, but his donation this month of $2.86 billion of Berkshire stock to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and four family charities led to his drop to fourth place. He has donated more than $24.3 billion to the Gates Foundation and family charities since 2006. Berkshire is based in Omaha, Nebraska, and has roughly 90 business units including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad and Dairy Queen ice cream. In June, Buffett called Bezos a “classic example” of how a business owner could thrive, by having focused at Amazon on how to “delight” customers, and keep them coming back, rather than simply process their orders.

113,BRKa,"Berkshire profit up 25 percent as insurance helps, BNSF weighs","(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Friday said its second-quarter profit rose 25 percent, helped by improvement in insurance underwriting, investment gains and the purchase of Precision Castparts Corp, Warren Buffett’s largest acquisition. But operating results fell short of analyst forecasts, as depressed oil prices and coal demand weighed on volume at the conglomerate’s BNSF railroad unit, while units serving the oil, gas and heavy equipment industries struggled. Other businesses, including the Geico auto insurer, fared better. Net income for Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire rose to $5 billion, or $3,042 per Class A share, from $4.01 billion, or $2,442, a year earlier. Operating profit rose 18 percent to $4.61 billion, or $2,803 per Class A share, from $3.89 billion, or $2,367.  Analysts on average expected operating profit of about $2,911 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 6 percent to $54.46 billion. Book value per share, Buffett’s preferred measure of growth, rose 1.7 percent from the end of March to $160,009. Buffett has over the years diversified Berkshire far beyond its insurance roots, including through the $32.1 billion January purchase of Precision Castparts, which makes aircraft parts, and February acquisition of Duracell, which makes batteries. But many operations remain anchored in the United States, and several struggled with the same pressures stemming from low commodities and materials prices and demand. “Some of the ‘old economy’ businesses lagged, hurt by the weaker energy sector, but the insurance businesses turned around, especially Geico,” S&P; Global analyst Cathy Seifert said in an interview. “This is a conglomerate, and you have to take the good with the bad.” Insurance underwriting swung to a $337 million profit from a year-earlier loss of $38 million. That helped boost overall insurance profit, including investment income, 40 percent to $1.32 billion. The improvement included a near tripling of pre-tax underwriting gain at Geico, which added customers and boosted premiums while its rate of loss claims fell. Meanwhile, currency fluctuations helped Berkshire’s namesake reinsurance business swing to a $184 million pre-tax gain from a year-earlier $411 million loss. Float, or the amount of insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and which help fund Berkshire’s growth, grew to $90 billion from $89 billion at the end of March. Investments and derivatives overall generated $394 million of profit, compared with $123 million a year earlier. Most resulted from Kraft Heinz Co’s redemption of $8.32 billion of preferred stock that Berkshire held. Berkshire still owns a 26.8 percent stake in the food company, which is run day-to-day by Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital. The redemption also left Berkshire with more cash, $72.68 billion, than it had before it acquired Precision. “Investors should expect more acquisitions,” Seifert said. She has a “hold” rating on Berkshire, which does not pay a dividend and has outgained the Standard & Poor’s 500 this year. The April-to-June period was Precision’s first full quarter as a Berkshire unit, and helped boost pre-tax profit in Berkshire’s industrial products sector by 34 percent. Excluding Precision and Duracell, however, profit in that sector fell, hurt by what Berkshire called “soft market conditions” and competitive pressures that drove prices lower. BNSF saw profit fall 20 percent to $772 million and revenue drop 15 percent to $4.59 billion, though speed and on-time performance improved following costly capital upgrades in 2015. Among other businesses, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility unit mostly owned by Berkshire, saw profit fall 4 percent to $482 million, hurt by lower revenue from renewable energy and changes in the value of interest-rate swaps. Berkshire has roughly 90 operating businesses, including smaller units that sell such things as candy, ice cream, insulation, jewelry, kitchenware, running shoes and underwear. As of June 30 it also owned about $133 billion of stocks including Kraft Heinz, Wells Fargo & Co, Coca-Cola Co and IBM Corp. Berkshire maintained it has no plan to sell IBM, despite sitting on a $1.5 billion loss. In Friday trading, Berkshire’s Class A shares rose $3,180 to $218,010, and its Class B shares rose $2.53 to $145.65. The shares are 5 percent below their December 2014 record highs.

122,BRKa,Fitch Expects to Rate Berkshire Hathaway's Planned Issuance 'A+',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned 'A+(EXP)' ratings to four  new senior notes issued by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) and its wholly  owned finance subsidiary Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (BHFC) totalling  $2 billion. The offerings include $750 million of senior unsecured notes issued  by BRK and $1.25 billion of senior notes issued by (BHFC) which are fully and  unconditionally guaranteed by the parent. The proceeds of the note issuances from BRK will be used to refinance $750  million of 2.2% senior notes maturing this month. The proceeds from the BHFC  notes will be used to refinance $1 billion of 0.95% senior notes that matured  this month as well as provide funds for general corporate purposes. KEY RATING DRIVERS     BRK's consolidated financial leverage ratio was 28% as of June 30, 2016 and this  ratio is not expected to change since the issuance is essentially refinancing  maturing debt.  Further, this level of financial leverage would not trigger any  rating sensitivities, however, BRK is approaching Fitch's limits on financial  leverage and interest coverage. Consequently, a material acquisition funded with  significant amounts of debt would place downward pressure on BRK's ratings. Consolidated interest coverage in the first half of 2016 was 7.4x excluding  realized investment gains and losses on derivatives, which is below Fitch's  expectations of 12x for companies at BRK's rating level. An alternate  calculation of interest coverage, excluding railroad, utilities and energy, was  14.5x in the first half of 2016 and is consistent with the current rating  category. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to a future downgrade include: --Deterioration in the credit quality of key insurance subsidiaries (National  Indemnity, GenRe, and GEICO) that is no longer consistent with the current 'AA+'  rating. Measures of credit quality include Fitch's judgment of capitalization, a  total financing and commitments ratio greater than 1.5x, net leverage (excluding  affiliated investments) over 3.5x or a sharp and persistent reduction in  underwriting profits.  --A consolidated run-rate debt-to-total capital ratio that exceeds 30% or a  run-rate debt-to-total capital ratio from the holding company, insurance and  finance operations (including debt issued or guaranteed by the holding company)  that exceeds 25%. --Material increases in leveraged equity market exposure such as its equity  index put derivative portfolio. --Acquisitions or other actions that reduce outstanding cash below $10 billion  or approximately 5x consolidated interest expense.   Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: --A commitment to lower debt-to-tangible capital ratios attributed to the  holding company, insurance and finance operations. Fitch believes that this  would likely require the scaling back of the finance operations. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has assigned the following ratings:  Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. --$500 million 1.15% senior notes due August 2018 'A+(EXP)'; --$200 million floating rate senior notes due August 2018 'A+(EXP). Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (BHFC)  --$1 billion 1.3% senior notes due August 2019 'A+(EXP)'; --$250 million floating rate senior notes due August 2019 'A+(EXP)'.

123,BRKa,"UPDATE 2-Berkshire takes bigger bite of Apple, pares Wal-Mart","(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Monday said it has increased its stake in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) by 55 percent, boosting its bet on the iPhone and iPod maker even as prominent investors like George Soros and Carl Icahn shed theirs. Berkshire owned 15.23 million Apple shares worth $1.46 billion as of June 30, up from 9.81 million shares as of March 31, according to a regulatory filing from Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate. The filing also said Berkshire cut its stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), the world’s largest retailer, by 27 percent to about 40.23 million shares from 55.24 million. Wal-Mart has been in Berkshire’s portfolio for more than a decade. It was unclear whether Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, are investing in Apple. Berkshire owned more than $133 billion of equities as of June 30. Buffett is typically responsible for larger investments such as Wal-Mart, while his deputies handle smaller investments. “They have more of a trading orientation than Buffett, and may view Apple as attractive because the stock appears cheap or may have a catalyst later this year,” Jim Shanahan, an equity analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview. “If Warren Buffett is buying a stock, he’s probably not going to sell it, or at least not sell for a very long time.” Berkshire also owns roughly 90 businesses including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Duracell batteries, and Fruit of the Loom underwear. It also paid $32.1 billion in January for aircraft and industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, Buffett’s largest purchase. Share prices often rise when investors perceive that Berkshire has given them its imprimatur, including the 3.7 percent one-day boost that Apple got in May after Berkshire unexpectedly revealed it had taken a stake. Berkshire revealed its higher Apple stake on the same day George Soros’ firm Soros Fund Management and Leon Cooperman’s Omega Advisors Inc said they dissolved their own Apple stakes. Icahn in April said he had sold his entire Apple stake, citing concerns about China’s policies regarding the company. He later said he would reinvest in Apple if his concerns ebbed. Monday’s Berkshire filing also disclosed other portfolio changes, among them lower stakes in farm equipment maker Deere & Co (DE.N) and Canadian oil and gas company Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO), and a higher stake in John Malone’s telecommunications company Liberty Global Plc (LBTYA.O). It also reflected Berkshire’s more than 14 percent stake in oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N). Shanahan said he believes Berkshire has been shedding Wal-Mart shares at least in part to buy Phillips 66. He has a “buy” rating on Berkshire. Berkshire’s filing showed that food company Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) was the company’s largest equity investment as of June 30, at $28.81 billion, followed by Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N).

129,BRKa,SolarCity disappointed in exclusion from Nevada solar rate case,"(Reuters) - SolarCity Corp SCTY.O said on Wednesday it was disappointed with a decision by Nevada regulators to exclude the company from a proceeding to decide how existing customers would be compensated for the excess energy their rooftop solar panels sent back to the power grid. Nevada’s Public Utilities Commission had voted unanimously in February to require households with solar panels to move to a new, less generous rate structure.  NV Energy [VNEN.UL], a Nevada utility owned by billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), asked the commission in July to maintain previous rates for customers with solar systems installed before Dec. 31, 2015. SolarCity last week requested permission to take part in the proceeding on whether or not to grandfather these customers. No other solar companies have sought to intervene, according to documents filed with the commission. The commission on Monday denied SolarCity’s request, saying its customers were adequately represented by the state’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. It added that the outcome of the proceedings would not affect SolarCity’s existing contracts. SolarCity said in a statement that the commission’s decision deprived Nevada solar customers of the chance to help decide policies that affect them.

134,BRKa,Buffett investing deputy Combs joins JPMorgan board,"(Reuters) - Todd Combs, one of Warren Buffett’s stockpicking deputies at Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), has joined the board of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), expanding the conglomerate’s already deep ties to the financial services industry. In a statement on Tuesday, JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, said Combs’ appointment took effect on Monday. His committee assignment will be determined later. Combs, 45, has taken a growing role at Berkshire since joining the Omaha, Nebraska-based company in 2010. Buffett has credited him with triggering Berkshire’s largest acquisition, the $32.1 billion takeover in January of aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp. “For such a young man, it’s a high honor,” Andy Kilpatrick, author of “Of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett,” said about Combs’ appointment. “It provides Combs board experience at a financial company and a platform to broaden his growth, which is important because he is a leader at Berkshire.” The appointment gives Berkshire direct ties to the three biggest U.S. banks. It owns $5 billion of preferred stock in Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), and has a more than $22 billion, or roughly 10 percent, stake in Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N). Berkshire also invests in American Express Co (AXP.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and US Bancorp (USB.N). It reported no JPMorgan stake as of June 30. Before joining Berkshire, Combs was a hedge fund manager at Castle Point Capital Management LLC in Connecticut. He and Ted Weschler, Buffett’s other stockpicking deputy, each manage roughly $9 billion. They are expected to take over Berkshire’s investments after Buffett, 86, leaves. “Hiring these two was one of my best moves,” Buffett said in his annual shareholder letter in February. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s chief executive, said in a statement about Combs: “Our company and our board will benefit from his wisdom and judgment.” Other Berkshire executives have also taken outside board roles.

139,BRKa,UPDATE 4-AmEx can bar merchants from steering card customers elsewhere,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Monday cleared the way for American Express Co (AXP.N) to block merchants that accept its cards from steering customers toward lower-cost cards from other issuers. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said a lower court judge in Brooklyn erred in February 2015 in finding that American Express’ “anti-steering” rules violated federal antitrust law. Underlying the case were the fees that merchants pay to process transactions, which the U.S. government estimated at more than $50 billion a year, and which can be passed along to cardholders in the form of higher prices. The lower court judge, Nicholas Garaufis, had found that non-discrimination provisions (NDPs) in American Express’ merchant agreements, meant to dissuade customers from using cards from Visa and MasterCard, unreasonably restrained competition. But the appeals court said Garaufis erred by focusing entirely on the interests of merchants rather than cardholders who might benefit from American Express rewards programs and perceived prestige. “Though merchants may desire lower fees, those fees are necessary to maintaining cardholder satisfaction,” Circuit Judge Richard Wesley wrote for a three-judge panel. “So long as AmEx’s market share is derived from cardholder satisfaction, there is no reason to intervene and disturb the present functioning of the payment-card industry,” he added. Shares of American Express, whose largest shareholder is billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), closed down 43 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $63.42. The shares had been down about 1.4 percent when the decision was issued. The decision may help American Express compete for space in customer wallets with Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N), whose cards are more plentiful but whose customers spend less. It may also help American Express boost revenue as it cuts costs to help offset the loss of lucrative co-branding relationships such as with Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O). Monday’s decision is also a defeat for the U.S. government and 17 states, led by Ohio, that challenged American Express’ anti-steering rules. Visa and MasterCard settled similar lawsuits in 2011 by agreeing to change their rules. Mark Abueg, a U.S. Department of Justice spokesman, declined to comment. Kate Hanson, a spokeswoman for Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, said that they are reviewing the decision. American Express welcomed the decision.  “Consumers will be able to choose how they pay and our card members will not be discriminated against at the point of sale,” spokeswoman Marina Norville said. Lawyers for dozens of retailers, such as Target Corp (TGT.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), had argued that voiding American Express’ anti-steering rules would encourage competition and drive prices they pay to card networks lower. In his ruling, Garaufis had said the NDPs enabled American Express to wrongfully exploit its 26.4 percent share of purchase volume in the U.S. credit and charge card market. The judge later imposed an injunction that also allowed merchants to offer discounts, rebates and other incentives to customers for using other cards with lower fees. But in December, after American Express said the injunction would cause irreparable harm, the appeals court temporarily lifted that injunction, enabling the company to enforce its rules during the appeal. Monday’s decision means it can continue doing so. Visa and MasterCard together recently had close to 1.2 billion cards in the United States.

140,BRKa,AmEx can bar merchants from steering card customers elsewhere,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Monday cleared the way for American Express Co (AXP.N) to block merchants that accept its cards from steering customers toward lower-cost cards from other issuers. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said a lower court judge in Brooklyn erred in February 2015 in finding that American Express’ “anti-steering” rules violated federal antitrust law. Underlying the case were the fees that merchants pay to process transactions, which the U.S. government estimated at more than $50 billion a year, and which can be passed along to cardholders in the form of higher prices. The lower court judge, Nicholas Garaufis, had found that non-discrimination provisions (NDPs) in American Express’ merchant agreements, meant to dissuade customers from using cards from Visa and MasterCard, unreasonably restrained competition. But the appeals court said Garaufis erred by focusing entirely on the interests of merchants rather than cardholders who might benefit from American Express rewards programs and perceived prestige. “Though merchants may desire lower fees, those fees are necessary to maintaining cardholder satisfaction,” Circuit Judge Richard Wesley wrote for a three-judge panel. “So long as AmEx’s market share is derived from cardholder satisfaction, there is no reason to intervene and disturb the present functioning of the payment-card industry,” he added.

141,BRKa,UPDATE 6-U.S. House panel lambastes Wells Fargo boss over phantom accounts,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers called on Thursday for Wells Fargo & Co chief John Stumpf to resign and a top House Democrat demanded the bank be broken up because it is too big to manage. Stumpf’s second trip to Capitol Hill on Thursday went no better than his first as lawmakers from both parties rebuked his handling of sales abuses and said the bank had damaged customer trust as well as the broader banking system. Wells Fargo staff opened checking, savings and credit card accounts without customer say-so for years to satisfy managers’ demand for new business, according to a $190 million settlement with regulators reached early this month. U.S. Representative Maxine Waters, the committee’s senior Democrat, faulted the bank for identity theft in the fraud and called for Wells Fargo to be dismantled because it was too big to manage.  She called the sales abuses “some of the most egregious fraud we have seen since the foreclosure crisis.” After the hearing, the California lawmaker told reporters she would introduce legislation to break up Wells Fargo. The bank has said as many as 2 million accounts may have been wrongly opened and Stumpf promised to undo any harm to customers. The chief executive said, however, that Wells Fargo did not expect to see disgruntled bank customers in court. Wells Fargo is offering arbitration for its unhappy clients, Stumpf said. Pushed about whether he would waive that mandatory arbitration rule and allow customers to sue, Stumpf said: “No.”  Members of the House Financial Services Committee blasted Stumpf over the bank’s culture, his compensation and whether the right people were being punished for opening fee-generating, phantom accounts. The episode has been a stunning reversal for Stumpf, long regarded as a safe pair of hands in the industry for navigating Wells Fargo successfully through the financial crisis. Stumpf again heard lawmakers calling for him to step aside. Jeb Hensarling, the Republican chairman of the committee, said in his opening statement he had lost faith in Wells Fargo, which does some of his banking.   “Mr. Stumpf, I have a mortgage with your bank,” Hensarling said. “I wish I didn’t. I wish I was in the position to pay it off because you have broken my trust as you have broken the trust of millions.” Wells Fargo shares fell 2.07 percent to $44.37. Since Sept. 7, the last trading day before the scandal broke, its stock has lost 11 percent, or about $27 billion in market value, based on Reuters data. The stock is trading at its lowest since early 2014. Republicans on the committee have often advocated easing Wall Street regulations, but they were among Stumpf’s strongest critics at Thursday’s hearing. Asked by Representative Sean Duffy, a Republican from Wisconsin, about whether Wells Fargo employees ‘stole,’ Stumpf said: “In some cases, they did.” “I am deeply sorry that we didn’t do the right thing,” Stumpf said in response to a lawmaker who said the scandal had eroded the bank’s market value. Representative Steve Pearce, a Republican from New Mexico, faulted Stumpf for saying the company’s board could eventually be relied on to sanction the executives responsible. “I, sir, think you ought to submit a resignation and your board cannot hold off action on that,” he said.  Representative Brad Sherman, a Democrat from California, asked the committee to summon other Wall Street chiefs, including from Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp, to determine if they had imposed sales demands and quotas on their employees. “I don’t think, Mr. Stumpf, that you should be alone in this joyous experience,” Sherman said. Stumpf said the bank was strengthening oversight of sales tactics, changing procedures for issuing credit cards and had paid back past and current customers for any fees incurrent on the ghost accounts. Earlier this week, the bank took back $41 million in stock awarded to Stumpf, an unprecedented rebuke to a major U.S. bank chief executive officer. Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York raised questions about $13 million in stock sales by the CEO in 2013 after he learned about the abuses. Stumpf said he sold stock with proper approvals and added the sales were made “with no view about what was going on.”  The affair has triggered lawsuits, more investigations and wiped more than $20 billion from the bank’s market value. While Wells Fargo may be shielded from some customer actions, the bank may just be starting to face heightened regulatory scrutiny. On Thursday, the bank agreed to pay the Justice Department $4.1 million to resolve allegations it illegally repossessed cars owned by U.S. service members. In a separate settlement of similar allegations, the bank will pay a $20 million settlement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

144,BRKa,Mars Inc buying out Buffett stake in Wrigley,"(Reuters) - The candy maker Mars Inc on Thursday said it would take full control of its Wrigley chewing gum business, acquiring the minority stake held by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N).    Mars plans to combine Wrigley with its chocolate business, putting M&Ms;, Snickers, Starburst fruit chews, Doublemint and Extra gum, and Altoids mints under one roof. In 2008, Berkshire invested in Wrigley when it acquired $2.1 billion of preferred stock and $4.4 billion of bonds in connection with privately held Mars’ $23 billion purchase of the chewing gum maker. The bonds were repurchased in 2013, and Berkshire expected Mars to redeem half of the preferred stock, which carries a 5 percent dividend, by early January. Mars will instead redeem all of it. Terms were not disclosed. “I have enjoyed all of Berkshire’s experiences with the Mars family and management and wish them the very best,” Buffett said in a statement. “Both Mars and Berkshire have profited from our investment and that’s the way it should be.” The global confectionery business, worth $183 billion last year according to Euromonitor International, has struggled as more consumers move toward healthier foods, prompting some retailers to reduce shelf space for processed and sugary snacks. “We are grateful for the strong and productive partnership we have with Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway,” Mars Chief Executive Grant Reid said in a statement. “Sole ownership of Wrigley provides us with an opportunity to rethink how we simplify our chocolate and Wrigley businesses.” Mars, the world’s largest candy maker ahead of rivals such as Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) and Hershey Co (HSY.N), expects to combine its chocolate and Wrigley businesses during 2017 into Mars Wrigley Confectionery, with about 30,000 employees. The combined business will be based in Chicago, Wrigley’s longtime home, and led by Martin Radvan, Wrigley’s president and a 30-year veteran of Mars. Mars is based in McLean, Virginia.    Known for his taste in less-than-healthy food, Buffett has made Berkshire the largest shareholder of Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), and helped Brazil’s 3G Capital take over Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and Restaurant Brands International Inc (QSR.TO), which owns Burger King and Tim Hortons. Berkshire also owns See’s Candies. But unwinding the Mars stake will deprive Berkshire of a $105 million annual income stream from the preferred stock. The investment was one of several that Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate made during and soon after the financial crisis in brand name companies seeking to shore up their finances, and win the billionaire’s imprimatur. From 2008 to 2011, Berkshire invested well over $20 billion in high-yielding securities from Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Dow Chemical Co DOW.N, General Electric Co (GE.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Swiss Re AG (SRENH.S) and Wrigley. But many have been repurchased, forcing Buffett to find other ways to invest Berkshire’s $72.7 billion of cash. He lost $720 million of annual income in June when Kraft Heinz, in which Berkshire still owns a 26.8 percent stake, redeemed preferred stock. The Wrigley notes had thrown off an 11.45 percent coupon.

147,BRKa,Chinese automaker BYD forecasts up to 84 percent profit rise for 2016,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese automaker BYD Co Ltd (1211.HK) (002594.SZ), backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), on Sunday said 2016 full-year profit was likely to rise as much as 84.17 percent, as rapid growth of the green car market eases.

151,BRKa,"UPDATE 4-Berkshire profit falls 24 pct, keeps Wells Fargo stake","(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Friday said third-quarter profit dropped 24 percent from a year earlier, when it recorded a large one-time gain, but acquisitions helped boost operating profit at the conglomerate run by billionaire Warren Buffett. The company also reported a $22.1 billion stake in Wells Fargo & Co as of Sept. 30, suggesting it kept its 10 percent ownership position even as the bank became embroiled in a scandal over its creation of unauthorized customer accounts.  Berkshire is Wells Fargo’s largest shareholder. Quarterly net income for Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire fell to $7.2 billion, or $4,379 per Class A share, from $9.43 billion, or $5,737 per share, a year earlier. Operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses, rose 7 percent to $4.85 billion, or $2,951 per share, from $4.55 billion, or $2,769 per share. That missed the average $3,058.10 per share forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, in part reflecting weaker results at the Geico auto insurer and BNSF railroad, and falling demand from customers in industrial sectors. Results included a $1.6 billion gain when Mars Inc bought Berkshire’s preferred stock investment in its Wrigley chewing gum business. Last year’s results included a $4.4 billion gain related to the food company Kraft Heinz Co. Revenue was nearly unchanged at $59.1 billion. Book value per share, Buffett’s preferred measure of growth, rose 2 percent from the end of June to $163,783. Berkshire also ended September with $84.8 billion of cash, despite having completed a $32.1 billion purchase of aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp in January that was a key factor behind the boost in operating profit. In a change, Buffett highlighted the cash hoard in Berkshire’s press release accompanying results. “He has $85 billion of cash earning nothing,” said Steven Check, who invests $1.1 billion, of which 30 percent is in Berkshire, at Check Capital Management Inc in Costa Mesa, California. “It gives Berkshire a lot of pent-up firepower for more acquisitions.” Since taking over Berkshire in 1965, Buffett has built a conglomerate with roughly 90 businesses including Brooks running shoes, Dairy Queen ice cream and Fruit of the Loom underwear. Berkshire also owns dozens of companies’ stocks, including Apple Inc, Coca-Cola Co and International Business Machines Corp. Though the value of the Wells Fargo investment fell from $23.7 billion at the end of June, the decline can be explained by the more than 6 percent drop in the bank’s share price. That suggests that Berkshire has kept its roughly 500 million shares in the third-largest U.S. bank. Buffett has over the years repeatedly praised Wells Fargo, whose stock Berkshire has owned since 1989, and this year asked the U.S. Federal Reserve for permission to buy more. But he also warned that companies guard against the kind of reputational damage that Wells Fargo has suffered over the sham accounts, estimated to number up to 2 million, which have prompted a variety of potentially costly regulatory probes.  Buffett has said he would talk this month about the scandal, which emerged on Sept. 8 when Wells Fargo agreed to pay $185 million in fines to settle charges by U.S. regulators and a Los Angeles prosecutor. Berkshire’s operating businesses posted mixed results. Overall insurance profit fell 11 percent to $1.12 billion, and included a 34 percent drop from underwriting. Geico saw pre-tax underwriting gains slide by 47 percent in the quarter, as higher losses from storms and accidents offset increases in premium rates. But float, or the amount of insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and which help fund Berkshire’s growth, rose to $91 billion from $90 billion at the end of June. Profit from manufacturing, service and retailing companies rose 45 percent to $1.7 billion, as the addition of Precision helped offset “sluggish demand” for industrial products from the oil and gas and heavy equipment industries. BNSF saw profit fall 12 percent to $1.02 billion, hurt by a decline in coal and petroleum shipments that has dampened results this year and which Berkshire expects to persist. The Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit saw profit rise 19 percent to $932 million, helped by higher electricity margins at its MidAmerican Energy unit. In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares fell $456, or 0.2 percent, to $214,545 and Class B shares fell 69 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $142.95.

154,BRKa,"Berkshire profit falls 24 percent, keeps Wells Fargo stake","(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Friday said third-quarter profit dropped 24 percent from a year earlier, when it recorded a large one-time gain, but acquisitions helped boost operating profit at the conglomerate run by billionaire Warren Buffett. The company also reported a $22.1 billion stake in Wells Fargo & Co as of Sept. 30, suggesting it kept its 10 percent ownership position even as the bank became embroiled in a scandal over its creation of unauthorized customer accounts.  Berkshire is Wells Fargo’s largest shareholder. Quarterly net income for Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire fell to $7.2 billion, or $4,379 per Class A share, from $9.43 billion, or $5,737 per share, a year earlier. Operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses, rose 7 percent to $4.85 billion, or $2,951 per share, from $4.55 billion, or $2,769 per share. That missed the average $3,058.10 per share forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, in part reflecting weaker results at the Geico auto insurer and BNSF railroad, and falling demand from customers in industrial sectors. Results included a $1.6 billion gain when Mars Inc bought Berkshire’s preferred stock investment in its Wrigley chewing gum business. Last year’s results included a $4.4 billion gain related to the food company Kraft Heinz Co. Revenue was nearly unchanged at $59.1 billion. Book value per share, Buffett’s preferred measure of growth, rose 2 percent from the end of June to $163,783. Berkshire also ended September with $84.8 billion of cash, despite having completed a $32.1 billion purchase of aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp in January that was a key factor behind the boost in operating profit. In a change, Buffett highlighted the cash hoard in Berkshire’s press release accompanying results. “He has $85 billion of cash earning nothing,” said Steven Check, who invests $1.1 billion, of which 30 percent is in Berkshire, at Check Capital Management Inc in Costa Mesa, California. “It gives Berkshire a lot of pent-up firepower for more acquisitions.” Since taking over Berkshire in 1965, Buffett has built a conglomerate with roughly 90 businesses including Brooks running shoes, Dairy Queen ice cream and Fruit of the Loom underwear. Berkshire also owns dozens of companies’ stocks, including Apple Inc, Coca-Cola Co and International Business Machines Corp. Though the value of the Wells Fargo investment fell from $23.7 billion at the end of June, the decline can be explained by the more than 6 percent drop in the bank’s share price. That suggests that Berkshire has kept its roughly 500 million shares in the third-largest U.S. bank. Buffett has over the years repeatedly praised Wells Fargo, whose stock Berkshire has owned since 1989, and this year asked the U.S. Federal Reserve for permission to buy more. But he also warned that companies guard against the kind of reputational damage that Wells Fargo has suffered over the sham accounts, estimated to number up to 2 million, which have prompted a variety of potentially costly regulatory probes.  Buffett has said he would talk this month about the scandal, which emerged on Sept. 8 when Wells Fargo agreed to pay $185 million in fines to settle charges by U.S. regulators and a Los Angeles prosecutor. Berkshire’s operating businesses posted mixed results. Overall insurance profit fell 11 percent to $1.12 billion, and included a 34 percent drop from underwriting. Geico saw pre-tax underwriting gains slide by 47 percent in the quarter, as higher losses from storms and accidents offset increases in premium rates. But float, or the amount of insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and which help fund Berkshire’s growth, rose to $91 billion from $90 billion at the end of June. Profit from manufacturing, service and retailing companies rose 45 percent to $1.7 billion, as the addition of Precision helped offset “sluggish demand” for industrial products from the oil and gas and heavy equipment industries. BNSF saw profit fall 12 percent to $1.02 billion, hurt by a decline in coal and petroleum shipments that has dampened results this year and which Berkshire expects to persist. The Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit saw profit rise 19 percent to $932 million, helped by higher electricity margins at its MidAmerican Energy unit. In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares fell $456, or 0.2 percent, to $214,545 and Class B shares fell 69 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $142.95.

155,BRKa,"Berkshire sets record as Trump boosts prospects, Buffett's wealth","(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) shares posted one of their best weeks in years, soaring 9.5 percent and touching a record high, even though Chairman Warren Buffett’s choice for the White House, Hillary Clinton, was defeated by Donald Trump. The conglomerate’s Class A shares closed on Friday up $1,110 at $234,860, a day after surpassing their record set in December 2014. Its Class B shares did even better, rising 9.8 percent. Berkshire's gains trounced the 3.8 percent increase this week in the Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX. They also boosted Buffett’s net worth to $70.3 billion, pushing him past Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Jeff Bezos to again become the world’s third richest person, Forbes magazine said. Buffett, 86, owns about 18 percent of Berkshire, which he has run from Omaha, Nebraska since 1965. Berkshire owns roughly 90 companies including the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance and several energy and industrial businesses. It also has big stakes in financial stocks such as Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and American Express Co (AXP.N). Many of Berkshire’s businesses and investments may benefit if Trump’s ascendance to the presidency heralds greater government spending and fewer regulatory hurdles. BNSF, for example, has seen profit fall 19 percent in 2016, weighed down by declining shipments of coal. But that industry could be buoyed if Trump fulfills his promise to invigorate mining, and perhaps ease limits on carbon emissions. Meanwhile, shares of Wells Fargo, in which Berkshire owns a 10 percent stake, rose 16 percent this week despite being enmeshed in a scandal over employees who set up accounts without customers’ permission, in a drive to meet sales goals. In an interview broadcast on Friday, Buffett told CNN that Wells Fargo had a “dumb incentive system,” and that its former Chief Executive John Stumpf, who left his post in October, was a decent man who nonetheless made a “hell of a mistake” and failed to correct it. Still, Buffett said he had not sold Wells Fargo shares. He also remained confident about longer-term prospects for equities, of which Berkshire owned more than $131 billion at the end of September. Berkshire’s own market value is roughly $386 billion. “The stock market will be higher 10, 20, 30 years from now,” Buffett told CNN. “It would have been with Hillary, and it ... will be with Trump.” ",11112016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-hatha-buffett/berkshire-sets-record-as-trump-boosts-prospects-buffetts-wealth-idUSKBN1362DA

157,BRKa,Buffett breaks silence on Wells Fargo bogus account scandal,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co made a “terrible mistake” by keeping in place sales goals that “corrupted people”, billionaire investor Warren Buffett told CNN in an interview, in his first public comment on the bogus account scandal at the bank. “It was a dumb incentive system, which when they found out it was dumb, they didn’t do anything about it,” Buffett told CNN’s Poppy Harlow. Berkshire Hathaway Inc, the conglomerate run by Buffett, is Wells Fargo’s largest shareholder.  The scandal at Wells Fargo emerged in September when the bank agreed to pay $185 million to settle regulatory charges that some of its employees opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers’ knowledge, in order to meet sales targets. It also led to the departure of veteran Chief Executive John Stumpf last month. Buffett described Stumpf as a “very decent man” who made a “hell of a mistake” and didn’t correct it. When asked by Harlow if he had advised Stumpf to step down, Buffett said he had not. “I don’t know the exact words, but I said I don’t think you understand the gravity of this,” he said. The legendary investor backed Tim Sloan, who succeeded Stumpf as CEO of the third-largest U.S. bank by assets.  Buffett has over the years repeatedly praised Wells Fargo, whose stock Berkshire has owned since 1989, and this year asked the U.S. Federal Reserve for permission to buy more.

159,BRKa,UPDATE 2-Warren Buffett's Berkshire makes surprise U.S. airline bet,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Monday said it has bought shares in the four biggest U.S. airlines: American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc. The investments mark an unexpected reversal for Berkshire, which has avoided the airline sector for nearly two decades after a troubled investment in the former US Air Group, a forerunner to American. They also expand Berkshire’s bet on the U.S. economy, and in particular transportation. Berkshire already owns the BNSF railroad and the NetJets luxury plane unit, and in January paid $32.1 billion for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts. According to a regulatory filing, Berkshire as of Sept. 30 owned 21.8 million American shares worth $797 million, 6.3 million Delta shares worth $249.3 million, and 4.5 million United shares worth $237.8 million. Buffett told CNBC television that Berkshire later invested in Southwest, and was disclosing that stake to avoid misleading investors into believing he was avoiding the carrier. It is unclear whether Buffett or one of his deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, invested in the airlines. Shares often rise when investors perceive that Berkshire has given them its imprimatur. Buffett usually handles larger Berkshire investments such as Kraft Heinz Co, Wells Fargo & Co, Coca-Cola Co and International Business Machines Corp. His Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns roughly 90 companies such as BNSF, Geico car insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream. The airline investments are “really important for investor confidence” in that sector, said Adam Hackel, an airline analyst at Imperial Capital LLC in New York. Berkshire did not respond to requests for comment. In after-hours trading, American shares rose 3.8 percent, Delta 3.4 percent, Southwest 3.3 percent and United 2.2 percent. U.S. airlines have benefited in recent years from lower fuel costs, labor peace, higher fees from checked bags and other once-free services, and reduced competition through mergers. Such factors helped the four largest U.S. carriers post a record $21.7 billion combined profit in 2015, and command more than two-thirds of the domestic market. Berkshire had ventured into airlines in 1989 when Buffett bought $358 million of USAir preferred stock, but he quickly regretted that investment. In 1997, he told Berkshire shareholders he had misjudged how USAir would “increasingly feel the effects of an unregulated, fiercely-competitive market whereas its cost structure was a holdover from the days when regulation protected profits.” Eleven years later, Buffett felt no better, calling airlines a capital-intensive business that earned little or no money. “A durable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers,” he wrote in his February 2008 shareholder letter. “Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.” Buffett nonetheless admitted to having sold the USAir stock, in 1998, at a “hefty gain.” Orville Wright died in 1948, more than 44 years after he and his brother Wilbur flew their plane at Kitty Hawk, N.C. American and Delta said they welcomed Berkshire as an investor, and American said it “reinforces our view that our industry has fundamentally changed in a profound and lasting way.” Southwest declined to comment. United had no immediate comment. Berkshire on Monday also disclosed other portfolio changes. It slashed its stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc by roughly two-thirds to 13 million shares. Berkshire had begun paring its stake in the world’s largest retailer earlier this year, after more than a decade of ownership. Separately, Berkshire reduced its stake in pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc, and exited an investment in Canadian oil and gas producer Suncor Energy Inc.

164,BRKa,Buffett's Berkshire is urged to sell fossil fuel stocks,"(Reuters) - A Nebraska nonprofit on Friday said it will propose that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) sell its investments in oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N) and other companies involved in fossil fuels over 12 years. The Nebraska Peace Foundation, which focuses on anti-war, civil rights and environmental issues, said it submitted a formal proposal for Berkshire shareholders to consider at the Omaha-based conglomerate’s annual meeting next May 6. Berkshire did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the proposal, which was reported earlier by the Associated Press. The nonprofit would face an uphill battle absent support from Buffett, who commands nearly one-third of Berkshire’s voting power. In April, shareholders including Buffett defeated its proposal that Berkshire report on the risks that climate change posed for its insurance businesses. Buffett called that proposal unnecessary, and only 11 percent of the votes cast favored it. The nonprofit said its fossil fuels proposal reflects the need to reduce greenhouse gases and shift toward renewable energy, without endangering Berkshire’s near-term profitability. It said the proposal would not cover businesses that Berkshire owns outright, including several utilities and the chemical company Lubrizol. Instead, it would cover investments such as Berkshire’s nearly $7 billion stake in Phillips 66, and its recently sold stake in Canada’s Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO). Buffett owns about 18 percent of Berkshire. Forbes magazine on Friday estimated his net worth at $71.7 billion. The Suncor sale “reinforces our faith about what Warren Buffett can do about this,” Tim Rinne, state coordinator for Nebraskans for Peace, with which the foundation is affiliated, said in an interview. “He’s a huge philanthropist, he’s an international icon and he’s extraordinarily smart,” Rinne said. “That puts him in an ideal position to make a statement for the entire world about addressing the perils of climate change.” Berkshire owns more than 90 businesses including Geico auto insurer, Dairy Queen ice cream and Fruit of the Loom underwear.

169,BRKa,Fitch Rates Berkshire Hathaway's Issuance 'A+',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 10 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned 'A+' ratings to four new  senior notes issued by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) and its wholly owned  finance subsidiary Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (BHFC) totalling  USD2.5 billion. The offerings include Euro1.1 billion of senior unsecured notes  issued by BRK and USD1.3 billion of senior notes issued by (BHFC) which are  fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the parent. The proceeds of the note issuances from BRK will be used to refinance USD1.1  billion of 1.9% senior notes maturing this month. The proceeds from the BHFC  notes will be used to refinance USD1.05 billion of floating rate senior notes  that also mature this month. KEY RATING DRIVERS     BRK's consolidated financial leverage ratio was 27% as of Sept. 30, 2016 and  this ratio is not expected to change, since the issuance is essentially  refinancing maturing debt.  Further, this level of financial leverage would not  trigger any rating sensitivities; however, BRK is approaching Fitch's limits on  financial leverage and interest coverage. Consequently, a material acquisition  funded with significant amounts of debt would place downward pressure on BRK's  ratings. Consolidated interest coverage in the first nine months of 2016 was 7.5x  excluding realized investment gains and losses on derivatives, which is below  Fitch's expectations of 12x for companies at BRK's rating level. An alternate  calculation of interest coverage, excluding railroad, utilities and energy, was  13.6x in the first nine months of 2016 and is consistent with the current rating  category. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to a future downgrade include: --Deterioration in the credit quality of key insurance subsidiaries (National  Indemnity, GenRe, and GEICO) that is no longer consistent with the current 'AA+'  rating. Measures of credit quality include Fitch's judgment of capitalization, a  total financing and commitments ratio greater than 1.5x, net leverage (excluding  affiliated investments) over 3.5x or a sharp and persistent reduction in  underwriting profits.  --A consolidated run-rate debt/total capital ratio that exceeds 30% or a  run-rate debt/total capital ratio from the holding company, insurance and  finance operations (including debt issued or guaranteed by the holding company)  that exceeds 25%. --Material increases in leveraged equity market exposure such as in its equity  index put derivative portfolio. --Acquisitions or other actions that reduce outstanding cash below USD10 billion  or approximately 5x consolidated interest expense.   Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: --A commitment to lower debt/tangible capital ratios attributed to the holding  company, insurance and finance operations. Fitch believes that this would likely  require the scaling back of the finance operations. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has assigned the following ratings:  Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. --Euro550 million 0.250% senior notes due January 2021 at 'A+'; --Euro550 million 0.625% senior notes due January 2023 at 'A+. Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (BHFC)  --USD950 million floating rate senior notes due January 2019 at 'A+'; --USD350 million floating rate senior notes due January 2020 at 'A+'.

In issuing and  maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast  information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and  underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch  conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it  in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification  of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are  available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.  Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the  information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and  other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts.

170,BRKa,Berkshire Hathaway unit buys big NYC-area real estate firm,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - HomeServices of America Inc, a unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), on Tuesday said it has purchased the Houlihan Lawrence residential real estate firm, its second foray into the New York City area this month. The purchase by HomeServices, the second-largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage, was disclosed eight days after its majority-owned Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices unit announced the opening of its first New York City office. Terms of Tuesday’s transaction were not disclosed.  Established in 1888 and based in Rye Brook, New York, Houlihan Lawrence has 1,300 employees and 30 offices serving the counties of Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess, Orange and Ulster in New York, and Fairfield in Connecticut. It said sales volume totaled $6.7 billion last year. Ron Peltier, chief executive of HomeServices, said in an interview that while there have been signs of softness in the New York-area luxury housing market, millennials and first-time buyers have shown greater interest in buying homes. “Houlihan Lawrence is a very prestigious, well-run and well-established company. It is a wonderful way for us to enter the marketplace,” Peltier said. “Even though the market may be experiencing a bit of a slowdown, it is going to be temporary.” Stephen and Chris Meyers, who are respectively chief executive and managing principal of Houlihan Lawrence, will remain, while their sister Nancy Seaman will step aside as chairman, the brokerage said. HomeServices said it now has nearly 29,500 employees in close to 570 offices in 28 U.S. states, and that residential sales volume topped $93 billion in 2016.  The Minneapolis-based brokerage was started in 1998, and has gradually entered the Westchester market in recent years. Buffett has run Berkshire since 1965. His Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s more than 90 businesses include insurers, chemical and energy companies, food and apparel companies and a railroad.

174,BRKa,"Gates charity to sell 60 million Berkshire shares, as Buffett urged","(Reuters) - The foundation created by billionaire Bill Gates and his wife Melinda plans to sell 60 million Class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) donated by Warren Buffett, reflecting the fellow billionaire’ s desire that proceeds be spent on charitable works. In a regulatory filing on Tuesday, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation said the sales would occur from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2020, under a plan similar to one expiring on June 30, 2017. Sixty million Class B shares of Berkshire are currently worth about $9.6 billion. The Gates Foundation, which works to improve education and health and reduce poverty worldwide, is the largest beneficiary of Buffett’s 2006 commitment to donate nearly all of his wealth to charity. The foundation, which received more than $2.1 billion of Berkshire stock last year, said it owns about 68.71 million Class B shares, worth roughly $11 billion. Bill Gates is a co-founder of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and a director of Berkshire. Buffett is also donating Berkshire shares to four family charities. In the HBO documentary “Becoming Warren Buffett” scheduled to air on Jan. 30, Buffett explained why he is giving away his fortune, estimated on Wednesday by Forbes magazine at $71.6 billion despite more than $24.3 billion of donations so far. “In my entire lifetime, everything that I’ve spent will be quite a bit less than 1 percent of everything I make. The other 99 percent plus will go to others because it has no utility to me,” Buffett said. “So it’s silly for me to not transfer that utility to people who can use it.” The Gates Foundation will sell its Berkshire shares through a 10b5-1 program, named for a federal rule allowing periodic share sales by executives and other insiders without raising the specter of insider trading.

176,BRKa,China's BYD plans to sell passenger cars in U.S. in 2-3 years: executive,"BEIJING (Reuters) - BYD Co Ltd (002594.SZ) (1211.HK) plans to sell electric passenger cars in the United States in about two to three years, an executive said on Thursday, as it races to be the first Chinese automaker to sell cars to American drivers. BYD, backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), specializes in electric and plug-in petrol-electric hybrid vehicles. At present, its U.S. presence is limited to producing buses and selling fleet vehicles such as taxis. Li Yunfei, BYD’s deputy general manager for branding and public relations, said its passenger car plan was not fixed as entering the U.S. was a complicated process. “It could be adjusted,” Li said at an event in Beijing. “Now we can only say roughly 2 to 3 years.” China’s government has used a raft of policies, including billions of dollars in subsidies, to spur a boom in electric and plug-in hybrid sales since 2015. The U.S., meanwhile, has lagged. BYD has had false starts in the U.S., with Chairman Wang Chuanfu previously saying the automaker would begin selling in the U.S. in 2010. Other Chinese peers have also encountered delays in entering the market. GAC Motor, a subsidiary of Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd (601238.SS), displayed three models at the Detroit Auto Show earlier this month, stating it would enter the U.S. by 2019 instead of a previous goal of 2017. A GAC Motor spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the delay. ",1192017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-byd-usa/chinas-byd-plans-to-sell-passenger-cars-in-u-s-in-2-3-years-executive-idUSKBN1530L4
177,BRKa,AIG to pay Buffett's Berkshire about $10 billion in insurance deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) has agreed to pay roughly $10.2 billion to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) to take on many long-term risks on U.S. commercial insurance policies it has already written. The reinsurance transaction covers “long-tail” exposures, which are liabilities that emerge long after policies are issued, from excess casualty, workers compensation and other AIG policies issued before last year. Berkshire’s National Indemnity Co unit, led by Buffett’s reinsurance chief Ajit Jain, will take on 80 percent of net losses in excess of the first $25 billion, with a maximum liability of $20 billion. AIG said the payment comprises $9.8 billion plus interest since Jan. 1, 2016, and will be made by June 30. The transaction helps AIG Chief Executive Peter Hancock lower risk at his New York-based insurer, which has reduced exposures and shed businesses since its 2008 federal bailout, and frees up capital for share buybacks. “This decisive step enables us to focus firmly on the future,” with “additional risk capacity to serve our clients and return capital to shareholders,” Hancock said in a statement. For Buffett, the transaction boosts how much his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate can invest, including stocks and whole companies. Berkshire’s float, which helps fund growth and reflects the premiums collected upfront before claims are paid, totaled $91 billion on Sept. 30. In a research note, Barclays Capital analyst Jay Gelb said the transaction’s long-term economics should be “attractive” for Berkshire. But Gelb and UBS analyst Brian Meredith said the transaction may signal lingering problems in AIG’s portfolio, even after a $3.6 billion charge in late 2015. “This announcement indicates that there may be more pain left,” wrote Meredith, who rates AIG “neutral.” Gelb rates it “overweight.” Berkshire did not respond to requests for comment. AIG plans to take a charge in the just-completed quarter for the transaction. It said it would have recognized a $2.9 billion loss had the transaction occurred a year ago. The payment to Berkshire represents nearly 3 percent of AIG’s investment portfolio. AIG will retain authority to handle and resolve claims, similar to an arrangement that Hartford Financial Services Group Inc (HIG.N) struck when it passed some asbestos liabilities to National Indemnity this month. National Indemnity in 2014 reached a similar reinsurance transaction with Liberty Mutual covering $6.5 billion of liabilities, but took responsibility for resolving asbestos and environmental claims. In afternoon trading, AIG shares rose 13 cents to $66.42, while Berkshire Class A shares rose $690 to $239,550.

184,BRKa,UPDATE 1-Labor nominee Puzder's company wins discrimination trial delay as confirmation looms,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Labor secretary nominee Andrew Puzder, the controversial business leader expected to undergo a U.S. Senate confirmation hearing next week, will be spared an emotionally weighted and concurrent discrimination trial against the restaurant group he heads. A state court in Orange County, California, has granted CKE Restaurants Inc a delay from Feb. 27 - when the full Senate might still be considering Puzder’s nomination - to early June for an age and disability discrimination lawsuit after the company cited “negative publicity” generated by his nomination. Puzder, CKE Restaurants’ chief executive, has been under fire by Democrats and labor groups for opposing increases in the minimum wage and aiming to curb worker protections. But his expected confirmation by a Republican majority in the Senate has not been knocked off track. By the June 5 trial, he may be labor secretary and well along the way to divesting himself from the company. Puzder agreed to divest his stakes in CKE, worth anywhere between $11 million and $55 million, if confirmed, according to an ethics submission reviewed by Reuters. Puzder’s confirmation hearing has been repeatedly delayed as a government ethics office reviewed his plan to divest from CKE, which owns franchised restaurants, including Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Puzder also promised to divest his holdings in more than 200 assets, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Altria Group Inc, Bank of America Corp and Cisco Systems Inc, within 90 days of his confirmation. He will divest from more illiquid funds within 180 days, but he declined to provide details for some of the funds’ underlying assets, citing a confidentiality agreement. The California case was brought by James Dombrowski, whose employment was terminated as he recovered from a brain biopsy, according to court filings.  CKE’s franchised restaurants have faced wage-and-hour and labor condition complaints from workers, but the Dombrowski case is against the holding company largely controlled by Puzder.  CKE was also named in an antitrust lawsuit filed by current and former Carl’s Jr. workers in a California court on Wednesday that alleges a scheme to suppress wages across its franchises by using “no hire” agreements. Dombrowski claims that he was fired by CKE when he tried to return to work in 2015, at the age of 68, after taking a disability leave following a brain biopsy which temporarily paralyzed him.  CKE’s attorney in the Dombrowski case, Scott Ferrell,  argued that the negative publicity surrounding CKE’s business practices due to Puzder’s fame as a Cabinet nominee would hurt the company’s ability to have a fair jury trial, not that the case would in any way hurt Puzder’s ability to be confirmed. Ferrell declined to comment on the case. Dombrowski’s attorney did not respond to requests for comment. A representative of Puzder also declined to comment. CKE Restaurants has said it is up to its franchises to set wages and working conditions and they are protected from liability as a franchisor. Senator Susan Collins, who is on the panel that will hold Puzder’s initial confirmation hearing next week, said she has not made a decision regarding Puzder. Collins was one of two Republicans to vote against Betsy DeVos, who was confirmed on Tuesday to head President Donald Trump’s Department of Education. “I have not reached a decision. I almost always wait until there’s a hearing, unless I know the individual well,” Collins said on Thursday.  “I’ve had two conversations with Mr. Puzder and I think there are questions outstanding that will be, I’m sure, delved into at his hearing,” she added. Puzder, an enthusiastic early supporter of Trump, has lobbied against efforts to raise the minimum wage and is expected to roll back rules aimed at curbing unpaid overtime and improving worker safety if confirmed to head the Labor Department.

185,BRKa,Labor nominee Puzder's company wins discrimination trial delay as confirmation looms,"(Reuters) - Labor secretary nominee Andrew Puzder, the controversial business leader expected to undergo a U.S. Senate confirmation hearing next week, will be spared an emotionally weighted and concurrent discrimination trial against the restaurant group he heads. A state court in Orange County, California, has granted CKE Restaurants Inc a delay from Feb. 27 - when the full Senate might still be considering Puzder’s nomination - to early June for an age and disability discrimination lawsuit after the company cited “negative publicity” generated by his nomination. Puzder, CKE Restaurants’ chief executive, has been under fire by Democrats and labor groups for opposing increases in the minimum wage and aiming to curb worker protections. But his expected confirmation by a Republican majority in the Senate has not been knocked off track. By the June 5 trial, he may be labor secretary and well along the way to divesting himself from the company. Puzder agreed to divest his stakes in CKE, worth anywhere between $11 million and $55 million, if confirmed, according to an ethics submission reviewed by Reuters. Puzder’s confirmation hearing has been repeatedly delayed as a government ethics office reviewed his plan to divest from CKE, which owns franchised restaurants, including Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Puzder also promised to divest his holdings in more than 200 assets, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Altria Group Inc, Bank of America Corp and Cisco Systems Inc, within 90 days of his confirmation. He will divest from more illiquid funds within 180 days, but he declined to provide details for some of the funds’ underlying assets, citing a confidentiality agreement. The California case was brought by James Dombrowski, whose employment was terminated as he recovered from a brain biopsy, according to court filings. CKE’s franchised restaurants have faced wage-and-hour and labor condition complaints from workers, but the Dombrowski case is against the holding company largely controlled by Puzder. CKE was also named in an antitrust lawsuit filed by current and former Carl’s Jr. workers in a California court on Wednesday that alleges a scheme to suppress wages across its franchises by using “no hire” agreements. Dombrowski claims that he was fired by CKE when he tried to return to work in 2015, at the age of 68, after taking a disability leave following a brain biopsy which temporarily paralyzed him. CKE’s attorney in the Dombrowski case, Scott Ferrell,  argued that the negative publicity surrounding CKE’s business practices due to Puzder’s fame as a Cabinet nominee would hurt the company’s ability to have a fair jury trial, not that the case would in any way hurt Puzder’s ability to be confirmed. Ferrell declined to comment on the case. Dombrowski’s attorney did not respond to requests for comment. A representative of Puzder also declined to comment. CKE Restaurants has said it is up to its franchises to set wages and working conditions and they are protected from liability as a franchisor. Puzder, an enthusiastic early supporter of President Donald Trump, has lobbied against efforts to raise the minimum wage and is expected to roll back rules aimed at curbing unpaid overtime and improving worker safety if confirmed to head the Labor Department.

188,BRKa,EXCLUSIVE-Burger King and Tim Hortons owner in bid to buy Popeyes -sources,"(Reuters) - Restaurant Brands International Inc (QSR.TO), owner of the Burger King and Tim Hortons fast-food chains, has approached Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen Inc PLKI.O about a possible acquisition, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Shares of Atlanta-based Popeyes moved sharply higher on the news in afternoon trading. A deal would be a bet by Oakville, Ontario-based Restaurant Brands that it can use its international reach to introduce Popeyes’ famous Louisiana-style fried chicken and buttermilk biscuits to more diners globally. RBI and Popeyes have yet to agree on a deal price, and there is no certainty that negotiations will continue, the people said. Restaurant Brands has also been considering the acquisition of other companies, one of the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Popeyes declined to comment, while Restaurant Brands did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Popeyes shares jumped 14 percent in New York, reaching a record $75.30 and giving the company a market capitalization of around $1.6 billion. Restaurant Brands shares rose 4 percent to C$70.12 in Toronto, giving that company a market capitalization of C$32.34 billion.   Popeyes, whose fans include pop singer Beyoncé, began 45 years ago as a Southern-fried “Chicken on the Run” restaurant in a New Orleans suburb. It has since expanded to more than 2,000 restaurants, of which 1,600 are in the United States. The company has benefited from strong customer loyalty, as well as from a restaurant refurbishment program. Chicken accounts for about 10 percent of the fast-food industry, according to data service IBISWorld, and Popeyes’ market share is growing. The largest brands in the sector include privately held Chick-fil-A and Yum! Brands Inc’s (YUM.N) KFC. Private equity firm 3G Capital, which is controlled by Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann, owns about 43 percent of the voting shares in Restaurant Brands. 3G Capital has made a name by acquiring major U.S. consumer companies including Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O). Restaurant Brands was formed in 2014, when 3G Capital-backed Burger King acquired Canadian coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons Inc for $11 billion. 3G Capital’s long-time partner, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), committed $3 billion of preferred equity to finance that deal.

189,BRKa,UPDATE 2-Apple breaks intraday record high for first time since 2015,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc’s share price hit an intraday record high on Tuesday for the first time in almost two years as investors raised bets that a 10th anniversary iPhone will boost lackluster sales. The stock touched an intraday all-time high of $135.09, beating its previous intraday high of $134.54 set on April 28, 2015. Its final level of $135.02, a gain of 1.30 percent, was Apple’s second consecutive record closing price.  Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway said in a filing it more than tripled its stake in Apple during the December quarter to 57.4 million shares from 15.2 million shares.  It is unclear what Berkshire paid for its Apple shares, but so far in 2017 their value has increased by $1.1 billion, and legendary investor Buffett’s increased interest in Apple could boost already positive sentiment on Wall Street.   The S&P; 500’s largest component has climbed 50 percent from its low in the first half of last year and is up almost 17 percent so far in 2017, with many investors betting that Apple will mark the iPhone’s 10th anniversary with a dramatically improved model. Many on Wall Street also believe that strong sales of the iPhone 6S two years ago have left a larger-than-normal base of customers ready to upgrade. “We’re holding it, we look for opportunities to buy,” said Jeff Carbone, co-founder of Cornerstone Financial Partners in Charlotte, North Carolina. “Consumers feel better, people spend more money. There’s still a lot of good to come from Apple.”  The Cupertino, California, company reported strong December-quarter results on Jan. 31. Although it gave a cautious outlook for the current quarter, Wall Street expects revenue to grow this year after sinking nearly 8 percent in fiscal 2016. Apple’s stock recently traded at 14.3 times expected earnings, the highest level since April 2015 and significantly higher than the average price-earnings ratio of 12 over the past five years, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Apple ranks ahead of 87 percent of its peers in the StarMine Price Momentum stock picking model, which assumes long-term price trends tend to continue and that short-term trends tend to revert.

If there’s a little danger, what the hell, you’re not going to live forever anyway.”  Munger, 93, spoke for nearly two hours to investors and students on a wide range of issues.  He has been Buffett’s right-hand man for decades, helping the 86-year-old build Berkshire into a roughly $410 billion conglomerate with more than 90 companies including insurers, utilities, food producers and a railroad.  Berkshire also has large investments in dozens of stocks, including iPhone maker Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and the four biggest U.S. carriers: American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N).  On Tuesday, Berkshire revealed multi-billion-dollar stakes in all five companies, marking a reversal of its longstanding aversion to the technology sector and antipathy to the “joke” that Munger said airlines once were.  Berkshire is now Apple’s fifth-largest investor, and the largest or second largest investor in the four airlines.  “The nice thing about the game we’re in is that we can keep learning,” Munger said.  “He’s changed when he’s buying airlines, and he’s changed when he’s buying Apple,” he said of Buffett.  “I don’t think we’ve gone crazy,” Munger added. “I think we’re adapting.”  Munger downplayed the impact of the recent scandal afflicting Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), in which Berkshire is the largest investor with a roughly 10 percent stake.  Wells Fargo was caught flat-footed by the public outcry after it settled regulatory charges that workers created as many as 2 million sham customer accounts to meet sales goals.

Trump, in a meeting with top executives at U.S. retail companies, said he would lower taxes substantially and simplify the tax code - echoing a vow he made last Thursday that renewed optimism about the economy and revived the “Trump trade”. His comments boosted already upbeat sentiment after a spate of robust economic data - including bigger-than-expected gains in retail sales and consumer prices in January - that reinforced the strength of the economy. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in a testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, stood by the stance she took on Tuesday that the central bank was on track to raise interest rates at an upcoming policy meeting. “She (Yellen) has made it clear that she wants to raise rates,” said Neil Massa, senior equity trader at Manulife Asset Management in Boston. “Before she spoke yesterday, the March meeting wasn’t in play, but now that is definitely on the table and I think the numbers today bode well for her to do that.” After the economic data, traders raised the odds of a rate hike in March to 26.6 percent from 13.3 percent before the data was released, according to Thomson Reuters data. Financial stocks, which benefit in a higher rate environment, again led the gainers among the 11 major S&P; sectors, with a 0.63 percent gain. The rate-sensitive utilities  and real estate sectors fell the most. At 11:07 a.m. ET (1808 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 79.89 points, or 0.39 percent, at 20,584.3. The S&P; 500 was up 5.07 points, or 0.21 percent, at percent, at 2,342.65 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 11.65 points, or 0.2 percent, at 5,794.23.

Yellen’s testimony before the House Financial Services Committee starts at 10:00 a.m. ET and comes a day after she said delaying a rate hike would be unwise, without indicating when the Fed would pull the trigger. Her testimony will be scrutinized for further clues on when the central bank might move, as will be comments by three Fed presidents at other scheduled appearances. Some Fed officials have said it would be prudent to move sooner than later. Also boosting the odds of a rate hike were strong reports that showed retail sales rose much more than expected last month, while the consumer price index notched its biggest rise in nearly four years as households paid more for gasoline and other goods. After the data, traders raised the odds of a hike in March to 26.6 percent from the 13.3 percent odds priced in before the data was released. Financial stocks, which benefit in a higher rate environment, again led the gainers among the 11 major S&P; sectors with a 0.2 percent gain. Yellen on Tuesday, before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, painted a largely upbeat picture of the economy, but also expressed uncertainty over economic policy under the Trump administration. At 9:40 a.m. ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was up 20.25 points, or 0.1 percent, at 20,524.66 and the S&P; 500 was down 1.31 points, or 0.05 percent, at percent, at 2,336.27. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.02 points, or flat, at 5,782.55, easing from an all-time high of 5,785.39. The CBOE Volatility index was up 9.6 percent, on track for its biggest rise this month. Six of the 11 major S&P; sectors were lower, led by interest rate-sensitive utilities and real estate  sectors. Apple rose to a record high of $136.26 after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in the company. Shares of Southwest, United Continental, American Airlines and Delta rose about 2 percent after Berkshire reported investments topping $2.1 billion in each of the carriers. Procter & Gamble rose 2.7 percent to $90.28 and gave the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P; after activist investor Trian Fund disclosed a stake in the consumer products company. AIG weighed the most on the S&P;, slipping 7.7 percent to $13.78 after the commercial insurer reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,762 to 889. On the Nasdaq, 1,383 issues fell and 929 advanced. The S&P; 500 index showed 43 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 56 new highs and seven new lows.

Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said on Tuesday, before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, that delaying a rate hike would be unwise, but did not indicate when the Fed would raise rates. While she painted a largely upbeat picture of the economy, she also expressed uncertainty over economic policy under the Trump administration. Yellen’s testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday will be scrutinized for further clues on when the central bank might pull the trigger, as will be comments by three Fed presidents at other scheduled appearances. Some Fed officials have said it would be prudent to move sooner than later, but traders have priced in a slim chance of a rate hike at the Fed’s March meeting. “Yellen’s hawkish stand yesterday was well received as investors focused on the upbeat assessment of the economy,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial wrote in a note. Adding to the recent spate of strong data, reports on Wednesday showed retail sales rose much more than expected last month, while the consumer price index notched its biggest rise in nearly four years as households paid more for gasoline and other goods. Dow e-minis were up 2 points, or 0.01 percent at 8:57 a.m. ET, with 30,047 contracts changing hands. S&P; 500 e-minis were down 5 points, or 0.21 percent, with 136,215 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 9.25 points, or 0.18 percent, on volume of 24,669 contracts. Wall Street’s main indexes have closed at record highs for the past four sessions, sparked by President Donald Trump’s promise on Thursday of a major tax announcement and fueled by Yellen’s comments. “While the rise continues to feed on itself, a prudent approach of not fighting the tape should be accompanied by being cautious,” Cardillo said. Among stocks, Dow component Procter & Gamble rose 2.5 percent to $90.05 after activist investor Trian Fund disclosed a $3.5 billion stake in the consumer products company. AIG slipped nearly 5 percent to $63.55 after the commercial insurer reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss. Shares of Southwest, United Continental, American Airlines rose more than 2 percent after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reported investments topping $2.1 billion in each of the carriers.

201,BRKa,"Berkshire takes huge bite of Apple, boosts airline stakes","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) was an aggressive buyer of stocks in last year’s fourth quarter, nearly quadrupling its stake in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and increasing its stake sevenfold in the four biggest U.S. airlines. In a regulatory filing, Berkshire reported owning 57.4 million shares of Apple as of Dec. 31, which would now be worth $7.74 billion, up from just from 15.2 million shares in the iPhone maker three months earlier. Berkshire also reported a $9.3 billion airline stake, with investments topping $2.1 billion in each of American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N). It also disclosed new stakes in satellite radio company Sirius XM Holdings Inc (SIRI.O) and seed company Monsanto Co MON.N, which is being bought by Germany’s Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE). Though it is unclear who make which investments, the filing appears to reflect much of the $12 billion of stock that Buffett  said he had bought between the Nov. 8 Presidential election and the end of January. Larger Berkshire investments such as Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) are normally Buffett’s, but the 86-year-old billionaire has given his deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler more to invest over the years. Berkshire’s initial investment in Apple got attention last year, given Buffett’s usual aversion to technology companies - apart from IBM - which he considers outside his zone of competence. The new, larger stake makes Berkshire one of Apple’s 10 biggest investors. “I’m stunned to see the size of that Apple position,” said Thomas Russo, who oversees $11 billion of assets, including 12 percent in Berkshire, at Gardner Russo & Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Berkshire did not respond to a request for comment. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns roughly 90 companies such as the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream. Its Class A shares closed on Tuesday up $2,078.95 at $250,419, a record high closing price and less than 0.2 percentage points below its all-time high on Dec. 14. The plunge into Apple appears particularly well-timed. Shares of Apple closed on Tuesday up $1.73 at $135.02, also a record closing high. Assuming Berkshire has not sold its stake, Apple’s 16.6 percent gain this year would leave it with a $1.1 billion paper profit in 2017 alone. It had been widely believed that Berkshire’s initial investment came from Combs or Weschler. But their decisions have sometimes influenced Buffett, as when Berkshire last year paid $32.1 billion for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, once a Combs investment. “It’s quite possible that Warren woke up and began to understand the virtues of Apple that he had been neglecting or, like with Precision Castparts, Todd or Ted had an affinity for Apple that sparked interest from Warren,” Russo said. Combs and Weschler are the leading candidates to eventually succeed Buffett as Berkshire’s chief investment officer. The airline investments, meanwhile, suggest that Buffett has overcome his two-decade aversion to the sector after an unhappy - though, he has said, profitable - investment in US Air Group. Buffett told talk show host Charlie Rose in an interview last month that it was “in large part” his decision to dive back into airlines. “The industry was once balkanized, but now it is bulking up, and has come to realize that an empty seat is a perishable asset,” Russo said. “More planes are traveling more full.” Shares of American, Delta, Southwest and United, as well as Apple, Monsanto and Sirius, rose in after-hours trading. Such increases often occur when investors perceive that Berkshire has given a company its imprimatur. Monsanto and Sirius did not immediately respond to requests for comment. To make room for new investments, Berkshire appeared to have shed a $1.8 billion stake in agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co (DE.N) and nearly all of what remained from a more than decade-old stake in retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N).

205,BRKa,Kraft Heinz bids $143 billion for Unilever in global brand grab,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. food company Kraft Heinz Co made a surprise $143 billion offer for Unilever Plc in a bid to build a global consumer goods giant, although it was flatly rejected on Friday by the maker of Lipton tea and Dove soap.  A combination would be the third-biggest takeover in history and the largest acquisition of a UK-based company, according to Thomson Reuters data. It would bring together some of the world’s best known brands, from toothpaste to ice creams, and combine Kraft’s  strength in the United States with Unilever’s in Europe and Asia.  The global packaged food industry is grappling with slowing growth, new competition from upstart brands, deflation in developed markets and more health-conscious consumers.  Although Kraft, which is controlled by U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett and private equity firm 3G Capital, said it looked forward to talking terms, Unilever said it saw no reason to discuss a deal without financial or strategic merit. Kraft approached Unilever earlier this week, according to people familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified because the approach was confidential. Kraft believes that investing in innovation would be an important part of the combined company, one of the people said. Kraft has also offered to keep three headquarters for the combined company in the United States, Britain and the Netherlands, the source added.  Credit rating agency Moody’s characterized the bid for Unilever as “credit negative” as the combined company would be more highly financially leveraged. There would be offsetting benefits such as cost savings, an expanded geographic footprint and improved product diversification, the agency said. Kraft wants the combined company’s credit rating to be investment-grade, according to the sources. Kraft has until March 17 to make a final bid for Unilever under UK takeover rules.  Unilever shares rose to a record following news of the offer, which analysts at Jefferies called a “seismic shock”, and  closed 15 percent higher, short of Kraft’s $50 per share offer price, with the news lifting shares across the sector. Unilever said Kraft’s proposal included $30.23 per share in cash, payable in U.S. dollars, and 0.222 of a share in a new enlarged entity per Unilever share and represented an 18 percent premium to its share price on Thursday. “We believe Kraft will likely need to raise its offer substantially if it hopes to change the outcome,” RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said in a research note.  Kraft’s move could flush out other bidders for Unilever, but of the potential rivals, U.S. consumer giant Procter & Gamble Co may face anti-trust hurdles, while pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods company Johnson and Johnson would likely not be interested in household products. Unilever, which has struggled recently amid slowing growth and currency fluctuations, saw its shares tumble 4.5 percent on Jan. 26, its worst day in nearly a year, when the company reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter sales. The share plunge encouraged Kraft to make an approach, another source familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named because the matter is confidential. Unilever has been hit by a slowdown in emerging markets, which it and other consumer companies have long relied on for growth, as well as in its home market, where consumers have been rattled after “Brexit,” Britain’s decision to leave the European Union last year. Brexit pushed down the value of the pound, raising the cost of producing consumer goods in Britain and straining relations between the country’s retailers and suppliers. For Kraft, its move comes as low interest rates and cheap debt have fueled big cross-border deals, making it the busiest start to the year for M&A; activity on record.  Still, investors will look at Kraft-Heinz’s own track record of boosting sales when evaluating whether they can help Unilever cope with its own slowed growth. Kraft’s sales fell 3.8 percent to $6.86 billion in the fourth quarter ending Dec. 31, and its U.S. sales, which account for more than 70 percent of total sales, fell 3.1 percent to $4.84 billion.  Kraft Heinz shares rose more than 10 percent in New York trading, helping lift the Nasdaq to a record high. Although Kraft is smaller than Unilever, with a market value of $106 billion as of Thursday, it is 50.9-percent owned by Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc  and 3G Capital, which also controls Anheuser-Busch InBev.  3G, known for driving profits through aggressive cost cutting, has orchestrated a string of big deals rocking the food and drink industry, including Anheuser-Busch InBev’s takeover of SABMiller and the combination of Kraft and Heinz.  A deal would offer opportunities to combine marketing, manufacturing and distribution in addition to cutting costs, but some industry analysts said Kraft might not want Unilever’s household and personal goods brands and could spin them off.  “This is cheap money meeting industrial logic,” said Steve Clayton, manager of the HL Select UK Shares fund at Hargreaves Lansdown, which owns Unilever shares.  “Kraft Heinz are attempting a massive push on the fast forward button ... To acquire the sheer scale of brands that Unilever represents through one-off acquisitions could take decades,” Clayton added.  Britain’s largest union, Unite, represents employees at Unilever, according to its website. Unite urged Unilever to continue fending off the takeover attempt to prevent job losses.  Unilever employs 168,000 people and generates roughly 17 percent of its revenue in the United States compared with Kraft-Heinz, which generates roughly 78 percent in America. A recent wave of cross-border deals in Europe is leaving British businesses vulnerable to possible job cuts. Pegeuot SA’s proposed acquisition of General Motors Co’s Opel business may eventually lead to heavy restructuring at the Vauxhall brands, which employ 4,500 people in Britain, sources said.

207,BRKa,Kraft walks away from 'friendly' bid for Unilever,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. food company Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) withdrew its proposal for a $143-billion merger with larger rival Unilever Plc (ULVR.L), the companies said on Sunday, raising questions about whether Kraft will turn its focus to another target. Kraft had made a surprise offer for Unilever to build a global consumer goods behemoth that was flatly rejected on Friday by Unilever, the maker of Lipton tea and Dove soap. Kraft withdrew its offer because it felt it was too difficult to negotiate a deal following the public disclosure of its bid so soon after its approach to Unilever, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations. Kraft had not expected to encounter the resistance it received from Unilever, one of the people said. Some key concerns raised during talks included potential UK government scrutiny, as well as differences between the companies’ cultures and business models, the person added.  “Kraft Heinz’s interest was made public at an extremely early stage,” Kraft Heinz spokesman Michael Mullen said in a statement. “Our intention was to proceed on a friendly basis, but it was made clear Unilever did not wish to pursue a transaction. It is best to step away early so both companies can focus on their own independent plans to generate value.” Kraft was forced to publicly disclose its offer on Friday to comply with Britain’s takeover regulations, after rumors of its approach to Unilever circulated among stock traders. Under UK takeover rules, Kraft’s public withdrawal of its offer precludes it from reviving takeover talks with Unilever for six months.  A combination would be the third-biggest takeover in history and the largest acquisition of a UK-based company, according to Thomson Reuters data. The combined entity would have $82 billion in sales.  The premature exposure of Kraft’s bid left the aggressive acquisition machine scrambling to craft an appetizing message for shareholders, the press, Unilever’s rank and file, and British and Dutch leaders. Prime Minister Theresa May ordered top officials to investigate if the proposed deal posed potential threats to British economic interests, the Financial Times reported. May has been adamant the government should be more active in vetting proposed foreign acquisitions of UK companies. She had previously singled out Kraft’s 2010 acquisition of another British household name, Cadbury Plc, as an example of a deal that should have been blocked.  A deal for Unilever would have marked the next installment of Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital Management Inc’s longstanding strategy of buying food companies and slashing costs. In 2013, 3G teamed up with billionaire investor Warren Buffett to acquire Heinz and then purchased Kraft two years later. It is now the second-largest shareholder in Kraft, behind Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N).  Unilever feared that a merger with Kraft, under 3G Capital’s relentless cost-cutting, risked eroding the value of its brands and could impede its expansion in emerging markets, which requires more investment, according to people familiar with the company’s thinking.  Unilever also saw its household products and consumer care divisions as too distinct from Kraft’s food business, the people added. 3G made its name in corporate America by orchestrating large debt-laden acquisitions and then slashing costs dramatically to juice profits. Using a strategy called zero-based budgeting, its managers must justify all expenses, from pencils to forklifts. The breakdown in deal talks sparked speculation among analysts and investors about whether Kraft might attempt to purchase another large consumer goods company as a backup plan. “We believe this announcement serves as a reminder – if needed – of (Kraft’s) interest, capacity, and commitment to pursuing large-scale M&A; in a potentially near-term time horizon,” said Barclays analyst Andrew Lazar in a note.   Its bid for Unilever, where more than 60 percent of sales come from home and personal care products, signals a willingness to make big buys outside of its historic area of focus - food -  said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj. He cited Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) as one potential target, noting that its stock popped 4 percent Friday on news that Kraft was eyeing Unilever.  However, the breakdown of the Unilever talks means that some food companies that have long been speculated as potential targets for Kraft, such as Mondelez (MDLZ.O), are still very much on the table, said an industry banker, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the press.       Low interest rates and cheap debt have fueled big cross-border deals, marking the busiest start to the year for M&A; activity on record. The bid also reflected a broader interest in UK companies as acquisition targets, in part due to the British pound, which has been under pressure since Britain announced plans to withdraw from the European Union.  Labor union representatives expressed relief that the deal talks broke down, citing concern about its potential effect on jobs and consumers.  “How many scares must the government put UK workers through before they actually do as they have promised, which is to make the takeover process socially responsible?” said Len McCluskey, general secretary at Unite, Britain’s largest union.

208,BRKa,UPDATE 5-Kraft walks away from 'friendly' bid for Unilever,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. food company Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) withdrew its proposal for a $143-billion merger with larger rival Unilever Plc (ULVR.L), the companies said on Sunday, raising questions about whether Kraft will turn its focus to another target. Kraft had made a surprise offer for Unilever to build a global consumer goods behemoth that was flatly rejected on Friday by Unilever, the maker of Lipton tea and Dove soap. Kraft withdrew its offer because it felt it was too difficult to negotiate a deal following the public disclosure of its bid so soon after its approach to Unilever, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations. Kraft had not expected to encounter the resistance it received from Unilever, one of the people said. Some key concerns raised during talks included potential UK government scrutiny, as well as differences between the companies’ cultures and business models, the person added.  “Kraft Heinz’s interest was made public at an extremely early stage,” Kraft Heinz spokesman Michael Mullen said in a statement. “Our intention was to proceed on a friendly basis, but it was made clear Unilever did not wish to pursue a transaction. It is best to step away early so both companies can focus on their own independent plans to generate value.” Kraft was forced to publicly disclose its offer on Friday to comply with Britain’s takeover regulations, after rumors of its approach to Unilever circulated among stock traders. Under UK takeover rules, Kraft’s public withdrawal of its offer precludes it from reviving takeover talks with Unilever for six months.  A combination would be the third-biggest takeover in history and the largest acquisition of a UK-based company, according to Thomson Reuters data. The combined entity would have $82 billion in sales.  The premature exposure of Kraft’s bid left the aggressive acquisition machine scrambling to craft an appetizing message for shareholders, the press, Unilever’s rank and file, and British and Dutch leaders.

IAG, which specialises in motor and property insurance, said net profit fell to A$446 million ($342 million) in the six months ended Dec. 31 compared with A$466 million a year ago but beat the A$419 million estimate of three analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

210,BRKa,Exclusive: Burger King and Tim Hortons owner nears deal to buy Popeyes - sources,"(Reuters) - Restaurant Brands International Inc, owner of the Burger King and Tim Hortons fast-food chains, is nearing a deal to acquire Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen Inc, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. The deal, which will likely value Popeyes at more than $1.7 billion, is a bet by Oakville, Ontario-based Restaurant Brands that it can use its international reach to introduce Popeyes’ Louisiana-style fried chicken and buttermilk biscuits to more diners globally. It also represents a small consolation prize for Restaurant Brands shareholder 3G Capital, which lost a $143 billion bid this week to merge its biggest holding, food conglomerate Kraft Heinz Co, with consumer products firm Unilever Plc. A deal could be announced as early as this week, the people said, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Restaurant Brands did not respond immediately to a request for comment, while Popeyes decline to comment. Popeyes, whose fans include pop singer Beyoncé, began 45 years ago as a Southern-fried “Chicken on the Run” restaurant in a New Orleans suburb. It has since expanded to more than 2,000 restaurants, of which 1,600 are in the United States. The company has benefited from strong customer loyalty, as well as from a restaurant refurbishment program. Chicken accounts for about 10 percent of the fast-food industry, according to data service IBISWorld, and Popeyes’ market share is growing. The largest brands in the sector include privately held Chick-fil-A and Yum! Brands Inc’s KFC. Private equity firm 3G Capital, which is controlled by Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann, owns about 43 percent of the voting shares in Restaurant Brands. 3G Capital has made a name by acquiring major U.S. consumer companies including Kraft Heinz. Restaurant Brands was formed in 2014, when 3G Capital-backed Burger King acquired Canadian coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons Inc for $11 billion. 3G Capital’s long-time partner, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, committed $3 billion of preferred equity to finance that deal.

211,BRKa,Buffett expected to tout passive investing in Berkshire annual letter,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, widely considered one of the world’s best investors, is likely to tout the merits of passive investing this weekend to readers of his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) shareholders. The letter, slated for release around 8 a.m. EST on Saturday, will probably focus on familiar themes for the 86-year-old Buffett, with many single-spaced pages reviewing Berkshire’s businesses and managers, Wall Street, the economy and perhaps even politics. “The letters are written as much for sophisticated financial people as for people in high school,” said Andy Kilpatrick, author of “Of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett.” “It’s a fun read, and when you get through it, you think, ‘Wow, I could be doing better with my life and my investing.’” Buffett believes most stock investors are better off with low-cost index funds than paying higher fees to managers who often underperform. He told Fortune magazine he expects to write ""a lot"" about passive investing. (here) Berkshire itself might seem anomalous, with shares of the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate having generated a roughly 2 million percent gain in Buffett’s nearly 52 years at the helm. In 2016, Berkshire’s stock price rose about 23.4 percent, easily outpacing the market, though most investors who bought its stock in recent years have achieved closer to market-average returns. Kilpatrick expects Buffett to discuss Precision Castparts, an aircraft parts maker that Berkshire bought last January for $32.1 billion, its biggest acquisition. Buffett is likely to discuss other Berkshire businesses, such as insurance and the BNSF railroad, and shower praise on Berkshire managers, perhaps including investing deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Combs alerted Buffett to Precision Castparts, and Buffett may discuss what drove Berkshire’s unexpected, multi-billion-dollar investments in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and the four biggest U.S. airlines.

U.S. President Donald Trump may also be a focus for Buffett, who was a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton. Buffett alluded elliptically to Trump in last year’s letter, bemoaning the “negative drumbeat” from presidential candidates talking down U.S. economic prospects.

213,BRKa,That $56 billion was here somewhere: Berkshire revises cash stake disclosure,"(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) shareholders might have been forgiven on Saturday for looking at the company’s annual report and wondering why some $56 billion of cash appeared to vanish. It did not, Chairman Warren Buffett assured them. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate has changed how it reports its cash stake, and no longer includes the overall amount in its consolidated statement of cash flows. In his annual shareholder letter, Buffett said Berkshire has about $86 billion of cash and equivalents, roughly triple the $28 billion shown on the cash flow statement. Berkshire had reported $84.8 billion there as of Sept. 30. Investors care about the stake because it shows Berkshire’s capacity to make big acquisitions, or purchases such as a big new investment in iPhone maker Apple Inc (AAPL.O), without having to sell existing businesses or investments. Buffett insists on a $20 billion cash cushion, in part for protection should natural or man-made catastrophes force big payouts by the company’s insurance units. So who was to blame for the reporting change? Accountants and auditors. In a footnote, Berkshire said it had invested “significant amounts” last year in U.S. Treasury bills maturing in more than three months. Berkshire said it had previously classified such Treasury bills as cash equivalents, noting that they are highly liquid and not that sensitive to interest-rate changes. But after consulting “relevant accounting literature” and talking with its independent auditors, “we have concluded that, notwithstanding our view of the substance of such instruments, these U.S. Treasury Bills technically do not meet a ‘bright line’ definition of cash equivalents” under generally accepted accounting principles,” Berkshire said. As a result, Berkshire is now reporting its longer-dated Treasury bills with its consolidated balance sheets. It reported $58.3 billion of Treasury bills there, versus just $4.6 billion a year earlier. Berkshire also revised prior cash flow statements to reflect the change. “We believe that these changes have no effect whatsoever on our financial condition,” Berkshire said.

214,BRKa,Buffett calls Clayton Homes unit 'best-in-class' despite critics,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday used part of his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) shareholders to defend the businesses practices of one of his conglomerate’s lesser-known but more controversial operating units: Clayton Homes. The mobile home unit, which Berkshire bought for $1.7 billion in 2003, came under fire in reports two years ago in the Seattle Times accusing Clayton of driving black, Latino and Native American borrowers into unaffordable subprime loans, and promoting a racist corporate culture. Clayton has forcefully denied such allegations, and Buffett’s annual letter came to its defense for the second straight year. “Clayton and Berkshire have been a wonderful partnership,” Buffett wrote. “Kevin Clayton came to us with a best-in-class management group and culture. Berkshire, in turn, provided unmatched staying power when the manufactured home industry fell apart during the Great Recession.” Manufactured homes are often bought by people with low credit scores and incomes, with financial profiles that Buffett said can be easily damaged by divorce or death. He called such demographics a factor in Clayton’s decision to foreclose on 8,304 manufactured housing mortgages last year, or 2.5 percent of its portfolio, at a cost of $150 million, compared with 8,444 foreclosures costing $157 million in 2015. But he said the Maryville, Tennessee-based unit also gave loan extensions last year to 11,000 borrowers, and canceled $3.4 million of payments from 3,800 borrowers. About 94 percent of loan balances were current on payments, down from 95 percent a year earlier, Berkshire said. For all of 2016, Clayton’s pretax profit rose 5 percent to $744 million, mainly from its $13.3 billion mortgage portfolio. Revenue rose 18 percent to $4.23 billion, mainly from the sale of 42,075 homes, equal to 5 percent of all new American homes, Buffett said. Clayton accounts for about 2 percent of Berkshire’s overall profit. The Omaha, Nebraska-based parent has more than 90 operating units including insurers, energy providers, food and apparel producers, furniture and jewelry makers, and a railroad.

215,BRKa,"Highlights: Buffett on immigration, stock buybacks and Jack Bogle","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Highlights from billionaire Warren Buffett’s annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders on Saturday: “One word sums up our country’s achievements: miraculous. From a standing start 240 years ago - a span of time less than triple my days on earth - Americans have combined human ingenuity, a market system, a tide of talented and ambitious immigrants, and the rule of law to deliver abundance beyond any dreams of our forefathers. You need not be an economist to understand how well our system has worked. Just look around you. See the 75 million owner-occupied homes, the bountiful farmland, the 260 million vehicles, the hyper-productive factories, the great medical centers, the talent-filled universities, you name it - they all represent a net gain for Americans from the barren lands, primitive structures and meager output of 1776. Starting from scratch, America has amassed wealth totaling $90 trillion.”  “It’s our market system - an economic traffic cop ably directing capital, brains and labor - that has created America’s abundance. Early Americans, we should emphasize, were neither smarter nor more hard working than those people who toiled century after century before them. But those venturesome pioneers crafted a system that unleashed human potential, and their successors built upon it. This economic creation will deliver increasing wealth to our progeny far into the future. Yes, the build-up of wealth will be interrupted for short periods from time to time. It will not, however, be stopped. I’ll repeat what I’ve both said in the past and expect to say in future years: Babies born in America today are the luckiest crop in history.”     “As the subject of repurchases has come to a boil, some people have come close to calling them un-American - characterizing them as corporate misdeeds that divert funds needed for productive endeavors. That simply isn’t the case: Both American corporations and private investors are today awash in funds looking to be sensibly deployed. I’m not aware of any enticing project that in recent years has died for lack of capital. (Call us if you have a candidate.)” “Charlie (Munger) and I want managements, in their commentary, to describe unusual items – good or bad – that affect the GAAP numbers. After all, the reason we look at these numbers of the past is to make estimates of the future. But a management that regularly attempts to wave away very real costs by highlighting “adjusted per-share earnings” makes us nervous. That’s because bad behavior is contagious: CEOs who overtly look for ways to report high numbers tend to foster a culture in which subordinates strive to be “helpful” as well. Goals like that can lead, for example, to insurers underestimating their loss reserves, a practice that has destroyed many industry participants. “Charlie and I cringe when we hear analysts talk admiringly about managements who always ‘make the numbers.’ In truth, business is too unpredictable for the numbers always to be met. Inevitably, surprises occur. When they do, a CEO whose focus is centered on Wall Street will be tempted to make up the numbers.” “There are, of course, some skilled individuals who are highly likely to out-perform the S&P; over long stretches. In my lifetime, though, I’ve identified – early on – only 10 or so professionals that I expected would accomplish this feat.” “If a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the hands-down choice should be Jack Bogle. For decades, Jack has urged investors to invest in ultra-low-cost index funds. In his crusade, he amassed only a tiny percentage of the wealth that has typically flowed to managers who have promised their investors large rewards while delivering them nothing – or, as in our bet, less than nothing – of added value. “In his early years, Jack was frequently mocked by the investment-management industry. Today, however, he has the satisfaction of knowing that he helped millions of investors realize far better returns on their savings than they otherwise would have earned. He is a hero to them and to me. “Can you imagine an investment consultant telling clients, year after year, to keep adding to an index fund replicating the S&P; 500? That would be career suicide. Large fees flow to these hyper-helpers, however, if they recommend small managerial shifts every year or so. That advice is often delivered in esoteric gibberish that explains why fashionable investment “styles” or current economic trends make the shift appropriate.”    ",2252017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-hatha-buffett-highlights/highlights-buffett-on-immigration-stock-buybacks-and-jack-bogle-idUSKBN1640NS
216,BRKa,Berkshire Hathaway gains $1.6 billion from its huge bite of Apple,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) is sitting on more than $1.6 billion of gains in its investment in Apple Inc.

Berkshire revealed that its massive stake in Apple stock, as of Dec. 31, had risen to 61.2 million shares for a total of $6.75 billion, an average of about $110.17 apiece, according to the annual report Saturday from Berkshire. As of Friday’s closing price of $136.66, Berkshire’s holding of Apple was valued at more than $8.3 billion. Berkshire became one of the top 10 Apple investors in 2016, taking a stake of more than 9 million shares in the first quarter and then accelerating purchases in the last three months of the year.  “I think Buffett likes Apple because of the hold or control that they are gaining over the lives of above-average income Americans and people around the world,” said Bill Smead of Smead Capital Management. “Buffett knows that people have become addicted to Apple products and he invests in these addictions.”  The Apple investment appears to reflect much of the $12 billion of stock that Buffett said he had bought between the Nov. 8 Presidential election and the end of January.

217,BRKa,Buffett upbeat on American business; Berkshire operating profit down,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday mounted a forceful and upbeat defense of the prospects for American business, as his Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) reported a higher quarterly profit though operating income fell.     In his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett said investors “will almost certainly do well” by staying with the long term with a “collection of large, conservatively financed American businesses.” Buffett puts Berkshire in that category, using the letter to tout the successes of many of his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s more than 90 operating units. These included businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Geico auto insurance that posted weaker results last quarter. “American business — and consequently a basket of stocks — is virtually certain to be worth far more in the years ahead,” Buffett wrote. “Ever-present naysayers may prosper by marketing their gloomy forecasts. But heaven help them if they act on the nonsense they peddle.” For the fourth quarter, Berkshire’s net income rose to $6.29 billion, or $3,823 per Class A share, from $5.48 billion, or $3,333 per share, a year earlier, helped by a $1.1 billion increase in gains from investments and derivatives.  Operating profit fell 6 percent to $4.38 billion, or $2,665 per share, from $4.67 billion, or $2,843 per share. Analysts on average had forecast operating profit of $2,716.60 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Book value per Class A share, reflecting assets minus liabilities and which Buffett calls a good measure of Berkshire’s intrinsic worth, rose 11 percent to $172,108. For all of 2016, profit was virtually unchanged, dropping to $24.07 billion from $24.08 billion. Operating profit rose just 1 percent to $17.58 billion, despite January’s $32.1 billion purchase of aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, Berkshire’s largest acquisition. The company also owns dozens of stocks including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and the four biggest U.S. airlines, and more than one-fourth of Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O). Buffett said Berkshire still has about $86 billion of cash and equivalents, despite recent heavy spending on Apple and airline stocks. Quarterly profit from insurance operations rose 7 percent to $1.44 billion, as underwriting gains at the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group more than offset a loss at auto insurer Geico, where claims for losses have been rising. The reinsurance business is run by Ajit Jain, widely considered a potential successor for Buffett, 86, as Berkshire’s chief executive. Buffett said Jain has created “tens of billions of dollars of value” since joining Berkshire in 1986. “If there were ever to be another Ajit and you could swap me for him, don’t hesitate,” Buffett wrote. “Make the trade!” The insurance units ended 2016 with $91.6 billion of float, the amount of premiums held before claims are paid, and which Buffett uses to fund acquisitions and other investments. That sum now tops $100 billion, likely reflecting a giant transaction last month with the insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N). Profit at BNSF, Berkshire’s largest purchase before Precision Castparts, fell 8 percent to $993 million. The railroad has been stung by falling coal and industrial volumes, and shed 2,000 jobs, or 4.5 percent, last year. But Buffett said society “will forever need huge investments” in transportation, and BNSF is well-served by a strong balance sheet, recent capital upgrades, and a growing emphasis on clean technology. “Charlie and I love our railroad, which was one of our best purchases,” Buffett said, referring to longtime Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, another major business, posted a 2 percent increase in profit, to $432 million. In Friday trading, Berkshire’s Class A shares closed at $255,040, and its Class B shares closed at $170.22. Both were record closing highs.

219,BRKa,Warren Buffett rails against fee-hungry Wall Street managers,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire Warren Buffett, whose stock picks over several decades have enriched generations of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) shareholders, delivered a black eye to the investment industry on Saturday, urging ordinary investors to buy plain-vanilla index funds. “When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients,” Buffett said in his annual letter to shareholders. “Both large and small investors should stick with low-cost index funds,” he added. Buffett, 86, used his investment savvy to build Berkshire into a powerhouse conglomerate and become the world’s second-richest person. Known to fans as “the Oracle of Omaha,” he estimated that the search for outperformance has caused investors to “waste” more than $100 billion over the past decade. On Saturday, he called Vanguard Group founder Jack Bogle “a hero” for his early efforts to popularize index funds. Berkshire itself has done far better, with its stock price gaining 20.8 percent per year since Buffett took over in 1965, dwarfing the Standard & Poor's 500's .SPX 9.7 percent gain, including dividends. Yet Buffett said most stock investors are better off with low-cost index funds than paying higher fees to managers who often underperform. In 2014, Buffett said he plans to put 90 percent of the money he leaves to his wife Astrid when he dies into an S&P; 500 index fund, and 10 percent in government bonds. During the financial crisis, Buffett bet a founder of the asset management company Protege Partners LLC $1 million that a Vanguard S&P; 500 index fund would outperform several groups of hedge funds over years. The index fund is up 85.4 percent, Buffett said, while the hedge fund groups are up between 2.9 percent and 62.8 percent. On Saturday, Buffett said he has “no doubt” he will win the bet. He plans to donate the money to Girls Inc of Omaha. While Buffett said no pension funds or “mega-rich individuals” have taken his advice on index funds and that “human behavior won’t change,” some investors are following his lead. Despite a roaring stock market in the United States, actively managed mutual funds bled $342 billion last year, their second straight year of outflows. Passive index funds and exchange-traded funds, meanwhile, attracted nearly $506 billion of new money. But Tim Armour, CEO of Capital Group Cos, which runs the American Funds and invests $1.4 trillion, said index funds can expose investors to losses when markets turn sour. The funds are one of Berkshire’s biggest investors. “We don’t dispute the data that has led Mr. Buffett and others to form their views,” Armour said in a statement. “However, a fairly simple fact has gotten lost in the debate. Simply put, not all investment managers are average.” Berkshire on Saturday also said fourth-quarter profit rose 15 percent from a year earlier, as gains from investments and derivatives offset lower profit from the BNSF railroad and other units.  Berkshire also owns dozens of stocks including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and the four biggest U.S. airlines, and more than one-fourth of Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O). This year’s letter and Berkshire’s annual report gave no clues about who will succeed Buffett as chief executive officer, a question shareholders and Wall Street have speculated about increasingly in recent years.     But Buffett lavishly praised Berkshire executive Ajit Jain, widely considered a leading CEO candidate, for smoothly running much of the conglomerate’s insurance businesses.     Jain joined Berkshire in 1986, and Buffett put him in charge of National Indemnity’s small, struggling reinsurance operation. Since then, Jain has “created tens of billions of value for Berkshire shareholders. If there were ever to be another Ajit and you could swap me for him, don’t hesitate. Make the trade!” Berkshire, which became one of the top 10 Apple investors in 2016, has gained about $1.6 billion on its Apple investment after shares of the iPhone maker surged. Berkshire’s airline investments suggest that Buffett has overcome his two-decade aversion to the sector after an unhappy - though, he has said, profitable - investment in US Air Group. Buffett, a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton, did not mention U.S. President Donald Trump by name in his letter. But he did, however, talk up the vibrancy of U.S. society and its inclusion of immigrants, one of the most polarizing issues under the Trump administration. And he said the future of American business and markets is bright. “One word sums up our country’s achievements: miraculous,” Buffett said. “From a standing start 240 years ago - a span of time less than triple my days on earth - Americans have combined human ingenuity, a market system, a tide of talented and ambitious immigrants, and the rule of law to deliver abundance beyond any dreams of our forefathers.”  ",2252017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-hatha-buffett-indexfunds/warren-buffett-rails-against-fee-hungry-wall-street-managers-idUSKBN1640F1
220,BRKa,That $56 bln was here somewhere: Berkshire revises cash stake disclosure,"Feb 25 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders might have been forgiven on Saturday for looking at the company’s annual report and wondering why some $56 billion of cash appeared to vanish. It did not, Chairman Warren Buffett assured them. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate has changed how it reports its cash stake, and no longer includes the overall amount in its consolidated statement of cash flows. In his annual shareholder letter, Buffett said Berkshire has about $86 billion of cash and equivalents, roughly triple the $28 billion shown on the cash flow statement. Berkshire had reported $84.8 billion there as of Sept. 30. Investors care about the stake because it shows Berkshire’s capacity to make big acquisitions, or purchases such as a big new investment in iPhone maker Apple Inc, without having to sell existing businesses or investments. Buffett insists on a $20 billion cash cushion, in part for protection should natural or man-made catastrophes force big payouts by the company’s insurance units. So who was to blame for the reporting change? Accountants and auditors. In a footnote, Berkshire said it had invested “significant amounts” last year in U.S. Treasury bills maturing in more than three months. Berkshire said it had previously classified such Treasury bills as cash equivalents, noting that they are highly liquid and not that sensitive to interest-rate changes. But after consulting “relevant accounting literature” and talking with its independent auditors, “we have concluded that, notwithstanding our view of the substance of such instruments, these U.S. Treasury Bills technically do not meet a ‘bright line’ definition of cash equivalents” under generally accepted accounting principles,” Berkshire said. As a result, Berkshire is now reporting its longer-dated Treasury bills with its consolidated balance sheets. It reported $58.3 billion of Treasury bills there, versus just $4.6 billion a year earlier. Berkshire also revised prior cash flow statements to reflect the change. “We believe that these changes have no effect whatsoever on our financial condition,” Berkshire said.

221,BRKa,Buffett calls Clayton Homes unit 'best-in-class' despite critics,"Feb 25 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday used part of his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders to defend the businesses practices of one of his conglomerate’s lesser-known but more controversial operating units: Clayton Homes. The mobile home unit, which Berkshire bought for $1.7 billion in 2003, came under fire in reports two years ago in the Seattle Times accusing Clayton of driving black, Latino and Native American borrowers into unaffordable subprime loans, and promoting a racist corporate culture. Clayton has forcefully denied such allegations, and Buffett’s annual letter came to its defense for the second straight year. “Clayton and Berkshire have been a wonderful partnership,” Buffett wrote. “Kevin Clayton came to us with a best-in-class management group and culture. Berkshire, in turn, provided unmatched staying power when the manufactured home industry fell apart during the Great Recession.” Manufactured homes are often bought by people with low credit scores and incomes, with financial profiles that Buffett said can be easily damaged by divorce or death. He called such demographics a factor in Clayton’s decision to foreclose on 8,304 manufactured housing mortgages last year, or 2.5 percent of its portfolio, at a cost of $150 million, compared with 8,444 foreclosures costing $157 million in 2015. But he said the Maryville, Tennessee-based unit also gave loan extensions last year to 11,000 borrowers, and canceled $3.4 million of payments from 3,800 borrowers. About 94 percent of loan balances were current on payments, down from 95 percent a year earlier, Berkshire said. For all of 2016, Clayton’s pretax profit rose 5 percent to $744 million, mainly from its $13.3 billion mortgage portfolio. Revenue rose 18 percent to $4.23 billion, mainly from the sale of 42,075 homes, equal to 5 percent of all new American homes, Buffett said. Clayton accounts for about 2 percent of Berkshire’s overall profit. The Omaha, Nebraska-based parent has more than 90 operating units including insurers, energy providers, food and apparel producers, furniture and jewelry makers, and a railroad.

222,BRKa,UPDATE 3-Buffett upbeat on American business; Berkshire operating profit down,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday mounted a forceful and upbeat defense of the prospects for American business, as his Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) reported a higher quarterly profit though operating income fell.     In his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett said investors “will almost certainly do well” by staying with the long term with a “collection of large, conservatively financed American businesses.” Buffett puts Berkshire in that category, using the letter to tout the successes of many of his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s more than 90 operating units. These included businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Geico auto insurance that posted weaker results last quarter. “American business — and consequently a basket of stocks — is virtually certain to be worth far more in the years ahead,” Buffett wrote. “Ever-present naysayers may prosper by marketing their gloomy forecasts. But heaven help them if they act on the nonsense they peddle.” For the fourth quarter, Berkshire’s net income rose to $6.29 billion, or $3,823 per Class A share, from $5.48 billion, or $3,333 per share, a year earlier, helped by a $1.1 billion increase in gains from investments and derivatives.  Operating profit fell 6 percent to $4.38 billion, or $2,665 per share, from $4.67 billion, or $2,843 per share. Analysts on average had forecast operating profit of $2,716.60 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Book value per Class A share, reflecting assets minus liabilities and which Buffett calls a good measure of Berkshire’s intrinsic worth, rose 11 percent to $172,108. For all of 2016, profit was virtually unchanged, dropping to $24.07 billion from $24.08 billion. Operating profit rose just 1 percent to $17.58 billion, despite January’s $32.1 billion purchase of aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, Berkshire’s largest acquisition. The company also owns dozens of stocks including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and the four biggest U.S. airlines, and more than one-fourth of Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O). Buffett said Berkshire still has about $86 billion of cash and equivalents, despite recent heavy spending on Apple and airline stocks. Quarterly profit from insurance operations rose 7 percent to $1.44 billion, as underwriting gains at the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group more than offset a loss at auto insurer Geico, where claims for losses have been rising. The reinsurance business is run by Ajit Jain, widely considered a potential successor for Buffett, 86, as Berkshire’s chief executive. Buffett said Jain has created “tens of billions of dollars of value” since joining Berkshire in 1986. “If there were ever to be another Ajit and you could swap me for him, don’t hesitate,” Buffett wrote. “Make the trade!” The insurance units ended 2016 with $91.6 billion of float, the amount of premiums held before claims are paid, and which Buffett uses to fund acquisitions and other investments. That sum now tops $100 billion, likely reflecting a giant transaction last month with the insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N). Profit at BNSF, Berkshire’s largest purchase before Precision Castparts, fell 8 percent to $993 million. The railroad has been stung by falling coal and industrial volumes, and shed 2,000 jobs, or 4.5 percent, last year. But Buffett said society “will forever need huge investments” in transportation, and BNSF is well-served by a strong balance sheet, recent capital upgrades, and a growing emphasis on clean technology. “Charlie and I love our railroad, which was one of our best purchases,” Buffett said, referring to longtime Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, another major business, posted a 2 percent increase in profit, to $432 million. In Friday trading, Berkshire’s Class A shares closed at $255,040, and its Class B shares closed at $170.22. Both were record closing highs. The shares outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index including dividends by 11.4 percentage points in 2016, after lagging by 13.9 percentage points in 2015.

Abel, 54, received a $15 million bonus under a performance incentive plan at Berkshire Hathaway Energy, where he has been chief executive since 2008 and chairman since 2011. He also got a $1 million salary plus $1.52 million of other awards. The total amount was down from $40.77 million in 2015, which included $39.5 million of incentive and bonus pay, and made Abel one of the best-paid U.S. executives. Many investors and analysts consider Abel a top candidate to  succeed Buffett, 86, as Berkshire’s chief executive. Abel also sits on the board of food company Kraft Heinz Co, controlled by Berkshire and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital. Buffett’s compensation is normally disclosed in March. The world’s second-richest person takes a $100,000 salary for running Berkshire. His total compensation was $470,244 in 2015, mainly reflecting the cost of security to keep him safe. Berkshire owns 90 percent of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Its profit from the unit, which consists of utilities, natural gas pipelines, other energy businesses and a real estate brokerage, rose 7 percent in 2016 to $2.29 billion. Results benefited as lower fuel prices boosted margins at PacifiCorp, which runs a regulated utility in several western U.S. states, while acquisitions and rising home prices boosted profit at the real estate brokerage. Though Buffett did not mention Abel by name in his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders on Saturday, he said Berkshire Hathaway Energy owns assets that are “of major importance to our country” and enjoys an “ever-widening diversity of earnings streams,” including from wind energy.

226,BRKa,UPDATE 5-Buffett's Berkshire more than doubled its stake in Apple -CNBC,"(Adds detail about Todd Combs and Ted Weschler in third paragraph) By Sam Forgione NEW YORK, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett told CNBC on Monday his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc had more than doubled its stake in Apple Inc.  since the end of 2016, making it one of Berkshire’s biggest equity holdings, and that U.S. stocks overall were not in “bubble territory.” “Apple strikes me as having quite a sticky product and an enormously useful product to people that use it, not that I do,” said Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway. He said Berkshire’s Apple stake, currently at about 133 million shares, was worth about $18 billion based on Friday’s closing price and amounted to Berkshire’s second-biggest holding. At the end of Dec. 31, Berkshire had held 61.2 million shares for a total of $6.75 billion, according to regulatory filings. Buffett said his ambitious move into Apple shares was piggybacking on the initial investment made by Buffett’s deputy investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook had done a “terrific job,” Buffett said, but added he had not bought shares since the company’s earnings report. Buffett, 86, who told the cable television network that Berkshire had spent about $20 billion on stocks since just before the Nov. 8 U.S. election, also said the U.S. stock market was cheap with interest rates at current levels. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last yielded 2.333 percent in morning U.S. trading. Buffett said it was extremely difficult to attempt to find a floor in stock prices and that he did not know what would happen in the near term in the equity market. He said U.S. shares could conceivably “go down 20 percent tomorrow.” Buffett said Berkshire’s positions in airlines remained unchanged. He said pricing shares of airlines has historically been a “very tough game” and he had never met the chief executives of the four airlines in which Berkshire holds stakes. Berkshire reported a $9.3 billion airline stake at the end of Dec. 31, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, with investments topping $2.1 billion in each of American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc , Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc. Buffett, who was a vocal supporter of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, said he would judge U.S. President Donald Trump based on how safe the country is in four years. He said he would also judge the Republican president according to how the U.S. economy performs overall and how wide participation in a better economy extends. Despite his disagreement with some of Trump’s policies, Buffett said the U.S. economy would be better off in four years under any president. He said that U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made “a lot of sense.” On Kraft Heinz’s snubbed bid for Unilever, Buffett said it was never intended to be a hostile offer and that there was not a “backup deal.” Berkshire is a key investor in Kraft Heinz. “Will there be another deal at Kraft Heinz some day? My guess is yes, but who knows when, I mean, there’s no backup deal, and again, it would have to be friendly and frankly, the prices in that field make it very, very, very tough to make an intelligent deal.” Asked about Berkshire’s $86 billion cash pile, he said the conglomerate was “always looking” for acquisitions but that there was “nothing close.” Buffett said it was enormously important for the U.S. economy to have 30-year government-guaranteed mortgages, but that mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  were not necessary in order to accomplish that. On 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, Buffett said: “It absolutely baffles me who buys the 30-year bond” and that doing so was not sensible at current yields. U.S. 30-year government bonds  last yielded 2.964 percent. Buffett reiterated that Americans are better off buying plain-vanilla index funds than committing money to active managers. He added that the hedge fund industry’s standard fee structure of 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of investment gains “borders on obscene.” In an annual letter to shareholders on Saturday, Buffett slammed fee-hungry investment managers: “When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients.” Buffett praised Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos as possibly the best manager he had ever seen and said Berkshire “missed big time” by not purchasing Amazon shares early on. He said the U.S. economy was doing “terrific,” even at just 2 percent growth per year.

The Nebraska Peace Foundation, which focuses on anti-war, civil rights and environmental issues, said it received a Feb. 9 letter from Berkshire detailing the Omaha-based conglomerate’s opposition to its proposal, to be voted on at Berkshire’s annual meeting on May 6. “The Board believes that Berkshire should not limit its universe of potential investments based upon complex social and moral issues,” Berkshire said, according to the nonprofit. “Berkshire’s businesses and the companies in which it invests have corporate governance structures in place to comply with state and federal laws, including compliance with state and federal environmental regulations and laws which reduce the environmental impact of their operations,” it added.

At the end of Dec. 31, Berkshire had held 61.2 million shares for a total of $6.75 billion, according to regulatory filings. Buffett said his ambitious move into Apple shares was piggybacking on the initial investment made by Buffett’s deputy investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook had done a “terrific job,” Buffett said, but added he had not bought shares since the company’s earnings report.  Buffett, 86, who told the cable television network that Berkshire had spent about $20 billion on stocks since just before the Nov. 8 U.S. election, also said the U.S. stock market was cheap with interest rates at current levels.  Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last yielded 2.333 percent in morning U.S. trading.  Buffett said it was extremely difficult to attempt to find a floor in stock prices and that he did not know what would happen in the near term in the equity market.  He said U.S. shares could conceivably “go down 20 percent tomorrow.” Buffett said Berkshire’s positions in airlines remained unchanged. He said pricing shares of airlines has historically been a “very tough game” and he had never met the chief executives of the four airlines in which Berkshire holds stakes.  Berkshire reported a $9.3 billion airline stake at the end of Dec. 31, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, with investments topping $2.1 billion in each of American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc. Buffett, who was a vocal supporter of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, said he would judge U.S. President Donald Trump based on how safe the country is in four years. He said he would also judge the Republican president according to how the U.S. economy performs overall and how wide participation in a better economy extends.  Despite his disagreement with some of Trump’s policies, Buffett said the U.S. economy would be better off in four years under any president. He said that U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made “a lot of sense.”  On Kraft Heinz’s snubbed bid for Unilever, Buffett said it was never intended to be a hostile offer and that there was not a “backup deal.” Berkshire is a key investor in Kraft Heinz. “Will there be another deal at Kraft Heinz some day? My guess is yes, but who knows when, I mean, there’s no backup deal, and again, it would have to be friendly and frankly, the prices in that field make it very, very, very tough to make an intelligent deal.” Asked about Berkshire’s $86 billion cash pile, he said the conglomerate was “always looking” for acquisitions but that there was “nothing close.” Buffett said it was enormously important for the U.S. economy to have 30-year government-guaranteed mortgages, but that mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not necessary in order to accomplish that. On 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, Buffett said: “It absolutely baffles me who buys the 30-year bond” and that doing so was not sensible at current yields. U.S. 30-year government bonds last yielded 2.964 percent.  Buffett reiterated that Americans are better off buying plain-vanilla index funds than committing money to active managers. He added that the hedge fund industry’s standard fee structure of 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of investment gains “borders on obscene.” In an annual letter to shareholders on Saturday, Buffett slammed fee-hungry investment managers: “When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients.” Buffett praised Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos as possibly the best manager he had ever seen and said Berkshire “missed big time” by not purchasing Amazon shares early on.  He said the U.S. economy was doing “terrific,” even at just 2 percent growth per year.

233,BRKa,U.S. SEC accuses Heinz guard of insider trading before Berkshire-3G deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former H.J. Heinz Co director’s security guard was charged on Wednesday with insider trading in the ketchup maker’s stock and options before Heinz was bought in 2013 by Brazil’s 3G Capital and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N). In a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Todd David Alpert made $43,873 of illegal profit after learning of the proposed Heinz takeover while working as a dispatcher for the director, who sat on Heinz’s board for several years. It was unclear whether Alpert, of Kingston, Pennsylvania, had hired a lawyer, and the defendant could not immediately be reached for comment. The director was not identified in court papers. Heinz’s board had since 2006 included Nelson Peltz, the activist investor. He could not immediately be reached for comment. Berkshire, 3G and the former Heinz director have not been accused of wrongdoing by the SEC. According to the regulator, Alpert had since January 2011 worked for a security company to provide services to the Heinz director and his family, and worked in a security booth at a home for the director where he reported “almost daily.” Public records show a shared historical address for Peltz and Alpert in a northern suburb of New York City. Part of Alpert’s job was to screen emails sent through a secure account, including a “confidential” Jan. 24, 2013 email that contained Berkshire’s and 3G’s offer to buy Heinz for the eventual $72.50 per share takeover price, the SEC said. Alpert began buying Heinz through his broker the next day, purchasing 1,000 shares and 30 call options he sold within two hours of the Feb. 14, 2013 merger announcement, the SEC said. According to the SEC, Alpert’s employment with the security company ended in July 2015, around the time he admitted his trading to the director, and the defendant is now unemployed. The SEC also said Alpert invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination when it questioned him. Berkshire and 3G bought Heinz for about $23 billion. They merged that company in 2015 with Kraft Foods Group Inc to form Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), in which they own a roughly 51 percent stake.

235,BRKa,Buffett's pay rises; Berkshire urges rejection of shareholder proposals,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s compensation for running Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) edged up 4.0 percent last year to $487,881 reflecting the higher cost of keeping the world’s second-richest person safe. Buffett’s pay was disclosed in a Friday regulatory filing, in which Berkshire also recommended the rejection of three shareholder proposals at its May 6 annual meeting, including that it disclose its political contributions twice a year. Berkshire said Buffett’s salary in 2016 was $100,000, the same amount he has received for more than a quarter century, while the cost of providing him with home and personal security services rose to $387,881 last year from $370,244. Buffett, 86, has run Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire since 1965, building it into a conglomerate with more than 90 units including Geico insurance, Dairy Queen ice cream and the BNSF railroad. Despite being worth $77.4 billion according to Forbes magazine, Buffett avoids some trappings associated with the rich. For example, he has lived for nearly 60 years in the same Omaha home, on less than three-quarters of an acre, bordering a well-traveled street. Berkshire billionaire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger also drew a $100,000 salary last year, while Chief Financial Officer Marc Hamburg’s pay rose 15 percent to $1.56 million. Executives who run some of Berkshire’s units make more money. They include Berkshire Hathaway Energy Chief Executive Gregory Abel, who made $17.5 million last year. Berkshire said adopting the shareholder proposal from Tom Beers and Mary Durfee on political contributions could expose it to “reputational and business risks” and hurt shareholders. It also said Berkshire units make less than $10 million of such contributions a year, while the parent makes none. Buffett himself was a strong supporter of Democrat Hillary Clinton in last year’s U.S. presidential election. The other shareholder proposals, respectively from Marcia Sage and the Nebraska Peace Foundation, call on Berkshire to report on its efforts to reduce methane emissions, and divest stakes in companies involved in fossil fuels. Berkshire said its gas pipeline and other units already recognize the environmental and cost benefits of minimizing methane emissions, and that it should not restrict its investments “based upon complex social and moral issues.” Buffett controls 32.7 percent of Berkshire’s voting power, making it difficult for shareholder proposals to pass without his support. He still owns 17.9 percent of Berkshire’s stock, despite having donated more than $24.3 billion of it since 2006.

241,BRKa,Chinese automaker BYD's Q1 profit to fall up to 35 pct y/y as green car sales slow,"BEIJING, March 28 (Reuters) - Chinese automaker BYD Co Ltd, backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, forecast a 24-35 percent year-on-year fall in net profit for the first quarter, as the government reins in subsidy support for green energy cars. The Shenzhen-based manufacturer , which has invested heavily in making battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, estimated net profit for Q1 2017 at between 550 million yuan ($80 million) and 650 billion yuan. BYD reported annual net profit rose 78.9 percent to 5.1 billion in 2016, roughly in-line with preliminary figures issued last month. China’s central government aggressively promotes green energy vehicles, including spending billions of dollars in subsidies, to combat urban pollution and encourage technology innovation. But the country imposed stricter requirements on electric carmakers after a subsidy cheating scandal last year. It also cut subsidies 20 percent this year to promote competition. “Changes to new energy vehicle (NEV) subsidy policy will affect the first quarter, the NEV industry will have a short-term adjustment,” the automaker said in its Shenzhen exchange filing. “The group’s NEV business will come under a certain pressure, and NEV sales and profits are expected to decline.” BYD reported slower earnings in the third quarter last year after four consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth as NEV sales soared. Earnings growth is expected to decline further in 2017 with analysts polled by Reuters predicting an 8 percent rise in net profit for the year. Sales of electric and plug-in hybrid cars fell 30.5 percent in the first two months of 2017 as consumers wait for local governments to announce their new subsidy policies for the year, which supplement those given by central authorities.

In a regulatory filing, the country’s largest automaker said that the proposal “would not help GM sell more cars, drive higher profitability, or generate greater cash flow.” Einhorn, who runs hedge fund Greenlight Capital, wants management to split its common stock into two classes: one that would receive the current dividends and one that would participate in all earnings and future growth of the company. The move would lower the company’s cost of capital, improve its financial flexibility and boost its market capitalization by as much as $38 billion, Einhorn said. To add more pressure on the company, Einhorn has said he wants to nominate directors but would not identify them. Moody’s and S&P; both declared shortly after Einhorn’s advances became public that such a structure could negatively impact the automaker’s credit rating. “Moody’s believes that the Greenlight proposal would reduce financial flexibility and increase credit risk,” Moody’s Investors Service wrote in a note. “The creation of a perpetual, cumulative dividend in excess of $2.2 billion would saddle GM with a sizable and largely inflexible cash outflow burden.”  GM considered the plan too risky after mulling Einhorn’s ideas for some seven months, while it was also negotiating the sale of German Opel brand and Britain’s Vauxhall to France’s PSA Group (PEUP.PA). It has hired two banks to help fight the plan, a person familiar with the matter said. Warren Buffett, one of GM’s biggest shareholders, has not weighed in on the plan and was not immediately available for comment. Einhorn said GM’s stock price has languished for years since emerging from the government-backed bankruptcy and is currently trading at the lowest valuation in the S&P; 500 stock index. But its dividend yield ranks among the top 25 in the index. Under Chief Executive Mary Barra, GM has been overhauling and pruning operations outside the United States and China, shrinking sales volume while pushing to improve return on invested capital and profitability.  The company has shuttered or scaled back operations in Russia, Australia, Indonesia and Thailand. In February the company sold its East African unit to Isuzu Motors Ltd (7202.T). Barra has promised investors returns of 20 percent or more.  GM announced earlier this month it would sell its European operations – consisting of Opel and Vauxhall - to PSA Group. But GM stock has performed poorly versus its peers. Ford Motor Co’s (F.N) stock, for instance, is trading at nearly 10 times earnings, while GM is at just under 5.8 times. GM stock has also lagged the broader S&P; 500 since its November 2010 IPO.  Because of its poor share performance, GM could face continued pressure to return more cash to shareholders rather than holding it as insurance against a potential industry downturn. Its stock was last up 2.7 percent at $35.64. For GM, this marks the second proxy fight in two years. In 2015, the company announced a $5-billion share buyback to end a proxy contest where investor Harry Wilson, who led the government’s bailout of the automaker, was pushing for a board seat on behalf of investors.  Einhorn’s hedge fund owns a 0.9-percent stake in GM, making it the 17th-biggest owner. The firm has been involved with GM for some time, buying the stock in 2011, selling it when the company faced problems with an ignition switch recall, and then buying back in about a year later. GM is a cash-rich target for any activist investor. Once its Opel sale is complete, the company will target a cash balance of $18 billion, a large sum for a company with a market capitalization of just over $50 billion. “Without the dividend, the (other class of) shares would be significantly less expensive to short, potentially pressuring shares further,” Joseph Amaturo of the Buckingham Research Group wrote in a client note. He added that GM’s response was “well-reasoned, and as such, (we) believe the likelihood of Greenlight’s proposal receiving board approval is relatively low.” Einhorn has a history of pushing unique capital plans at big U.S. companies and in 2013 urged Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to issue preferred stock with a perpetual 4-percent dividend. On Tuesday, as he launched his public campaign for change at GM, he also held some things back, refusing to say who may be on his slate of directors. “We have sent them a notice of nomination for the directors,” Einhorn said on CNBC. “We have not yet determined how many or which directors we will run ... We’re going to wait a little while for GM to file their proxy and so forth.”  Einhorn said he supports GM management, including CEO Mary Barra, regardless of what the company decides.      To be successful, Greenlight’s plan will have to get the support of some large institutional shareholders, including Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), which owns 3.34 percent of GM. Some analysts say it would be a sensible move.  “There is nothing radical about Einhorn’s proposal. It is essentially a call for the creation of a preferred stock that will have a priority for dividends. Investors will benefit from having a choice,” said Anthony Sabino, a professor at St. John’s University’s Peter J. Tobin College of Business. GM has hired Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to push back against Einhorn’s proposal, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. The banks declined to comment. GM said it expects to return about $7 billion in cash to shareholders in 2017, bringing total cash returns to about $25 billion since 2012.

243,BRKa,UPDATE 1-Investors unimpressed by Einhorn's GM share class plan -survey,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Investors have given billionaire hedge fund manager David Einhorn’s plan to boost General Motors Co’s value a frosty reception with most surveyed saying his call for two types of shares would not raise the automaker’s worth, according to an Evercore ISI poll. Einhorn, who runs hedge fund Greenlight Capital, this week proposed that GM create two classes of stock, one that pays a dividend and one that does not, to boost the No. 1 U.S. carmaker’s languishing share price. More investors would buy the shares, helping boost the company’s market capitalization, Greenlight contended. But 53 out of 61 investors surveyed by investment banking advisory firm Evercore ISI said they did not believe Greenlight’s proposal would lead to value accretion at GM. In fact, a significant majority of investors polled - 48 people, or 80 percent - said Einhorn’s plan could jeopardize the company’s credit rating. Of the investors surveyed, 34 percent were GM shareholders. Greenlight on Friday called the survey “fundamentally flawed” and through a spokesman said it failed to understand the firm’s plan to unlock value at GM.  GM rejected Einhorn’s plan, saying it had reviewed it for seven months but considered it too risky. Evercore ISI surveyed investors after Einhorn, whose Greenlight Capital has owned GM shares on and off for five years and has a 4.9 percent stake in GM, including options, released his presentation in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. Now Einhorn is taking his plan to GM shareholders more broadly through a proxy contest where he hopes to win seats on the board. Investors will vote on board members at the upcoming annual meeting and Einhorn would need to quickly mobilize many large owners to agree with his proposal in order to win enough votes for his slate. While a number of investors in Einhorn’s own fund have applauded him for coming up with this novel approach, no major GM shareholder has yet publicly thrown their weight behind the plan.  Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, which is GM’s sixth largest investor with a 3.34 percent stake, has remained silent about Einhorn’s proposal. Greenlight Capital is the 17th largest investor. Nearly all those polled, or 93 percent of investors, said they were satisfied with GM management’s plan to return some $7 billion to shareholders this year, through share buy backs worth $5 billion and $2.2 billion in dividend payouts. GM’s stock is currently trading at $35.46 and it pays an annual dividend of $1.52 per share.

245,BRKa,"Trump declares end to 'war on coal,' but utilities aren't listening"," WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - When President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week to sweep away Obama-era climate change regulations, he said it would end America’s “war on coal”, usher in a new era of energy production and put miners back to work.  But the biggest consumers of U.S. coal - power generating companies - remain unconvinced.  Reuters surveyed 32 utilities with operations in the 26 states that sued former President Barack Obama’s administration to block its Clean Power Plan, the main target of Trump’s executive order. The bulk of them have no plans to alter their multi-billion dollar, years-long shift away from coal, suggesting demand for the fuel will keep falling despite Trump’s efforts.  The utilities gave many reasons, mainly economic: Natural gas - coal’s top competitor - is cheap and abundant; solar and wind power costs are falling; state environmental laws remain in place; and Trump’s regulatory rollback may not survive legal challenges.  Meanwhile, big investors aligned with the global push to fight climate change – such as the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund – have been pressuring U.S. utilities in which they own stakes to cut coal use.  “I’m not going to build new coal plants in today’s environment,” said Ben Fowke, CEO of Xcel Energy, which operates in eight states and uses coal for about 36 percent of its electricity production. “And if I’m not going to build new ones, eventually there won’t be any.”  REUTERS RECOMMENDSWindow closing for Republican stealth assault on regulationsAfter Australian cyclone, coking coal spikes as China chases U.S. supplies Of the 32 utilities contacted by Reuters, 20 said Trump’s order would have no impact on their investment plans; five said they were reviewing the implications of the order; six gave no response. Just one said it would prolong the life of some of its older coal-fired power units.  North Dakota’s Basin Electric Power Cooperative was the sole utility to identify an immediate positive impact of Trump’s order on the outlook for coal.  “We’re in the situation where the executive order takes a lot of pressure off the decisions we had to make in the near term, such as whether to retrofit and retire older coal plants,” said Dale Niezwaag, a spokesman for Basin Electric. “But Trump can be a one-termer, so the reprieve out there is short.”  Trump’s executive order triggered a review aimed at killing the Clean Power Plan. The Obama-era law would have required states, by 2030, to collectively cut carbon emissions from existing power plants by 30 percent from 2005 levels. It was designed as a primary strategy in U.S. efforts to fight global climate change.  The U.S. coal industry, without increases in domestic demand, would need to rely on export markets for growth. Shipments of U.S. metallurgical coal, used in the production of steel, have recently shown up in China following a two-year hiatus - in part to offset banned shipments from North Korea and temporary delays from cyclone-hit Australian producers.  Coal had been the primary fuel source for U.S. power plants for the last century, but its use has fallen more than a third since 2008 after advancements in drilling technology unlocked new reserves of natural gas.  Hundreds of aging coal-fired power plants have been retired or retrofitted. Huge coal mining companies like Peabody Energy Corp and Arch Coal fell into bankruptcy, and production last year hit its lowest point since 1978.  The slide appears likely to continue: U.S. power companies now expect to retire or convert more than 8,000 megawatts of coal-fired plants in 2017 after shutting almost 13,000 MW last year, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration and Thomson Reuters data.  Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association, acknowledged Trump’s efforts would not return the coal industry to its “glory days,” but offered some hope.  “There may not be immediate plans for utilities to bring on more coal, but the future is always uncertain in this market,” he said.  Many of the companies in the Reuters survey said they had been focused on reducing carbon emissions for a decade or more and were hesitant to change direction based on shifting political winds in Washington D.C.  “Utility planning typically takes place over much longer periods than presidential terms of office,” Berkshire Hathaway Inc-owned Pacificorp spokesman Tom Gauntt said.  Several utilities also cited falling costs for wind and solar power, which are now often as cheap as coal or natural gas, thanks in part to government subsidies for renewable energy.  In the meantime, activist investors have increased pressure on U.S. utilities to shun coal.  In the last year, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, has excluded more than a dozen U.S. power companies - including Xcel, American Electric Power Co Inc and NRG Energy Inc - from its investments because of their reliance on coal-fired power.  Another eight companies, including Southern Co and NorthWestern Corp, are “under observation” by the fund.  Wyoming-based coal miner Cloud Peak Energy said it doesn’t blame utilities for being lukewarm to Trump’s order.  ""For eight years, if you were a utility running coal, you got the hell kicked out of you,"" said Richard Reavey, a spokesman for the company. ""Are you going to turn around tomorrow and say, 'Let's buy lots of coal plants'? Pretty unlikely.""

246,BRKa,Berkshire insurance unit sues Goodyear over asbestos claims,"(Reuters) - An insurance unit of Warren Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc said it has sued Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co to avoid having to cover asbestos-related injury claims that Goodyear said nothing about for seven years. Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance Co is seeking unspecified damages in its federal lawsuit filed on Wednesday in Akron, Ohio, where Goodyear is based. Goodyear spokesman James Peate said the company does not discuss pending litigation. Berkshire said Goodyear claimed to have in 2008 exhausted a policy from another insurer for the asbestos claims, but waited until November 2015 to seek reimbursement from Berkshire for “several millions of dollars” under an “excess” policy. It also said Goodyear had never asked for help in defending against the claims prior to November 2015. About 62,000 claims are pending against Goodyear in states including Florida, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas over alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products as floor tiles, furnace hoses, gaskets and heat shields, Berkshire said. Many companies stopped using asbestos by the mid-1970s after it was linked to cancer and other diseases. The effects of exposure to the substance can take decades to surface. Goodyear’s excess policy, issued by Berkshire predecessor Stonewall Insurance, covers the period from July 1, 1976 to July 1, 1977, Berkshire said. Berkshire is seeking a court declaration that it need not cover claims for Goodyear from 2008 to November 2015, and can recoup some money it has since paid on Goodyear’s behalf. Lawyers for the Berkshire unit did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance is a commercial property and casualty insurer created in 2013.

Berkshire on Wednesday said it concluded after several months of talks with Fed officials that maintaining the higher stake would “materially restrict” its ability to do business with the third-largest U.S. bank. The Fed exerts special oversight when investors take large bank stakes. It often allows double-digit stakes not designed to exert a “controlling influence,” but has said it would review any resulting business relationship “case-by-case.” Berkshire said “investment or valuation considerations” were not factors in its sale of 7.13 million Wells Fargo shares this week, and planned sale of another 1.87 million shares “in the near future.”  The company, which has owned Wells Fargo stock since 1989, also said it will sell more Wells Fargo shares if needed to keep its stake “slightly below 10 percent,” including if the bank repurchases its own stock. According to a regulatory filing, Berkshire owned 504.3 million Wells Fargo shares worth more than $27 billion before the sales, making it the bank’s largest shareholder. Buffett, 86, owned another 2.01 million of the bank’s shares personally.  Wells Fargo has been beset since September by a scandal over its creation of unauthorized customer accounts. “We appreciate the confidence that Berkshire Hathaway has placed in Wells Fargo over the years, both as our largest shareholder and a very valued customer,” spokesman Mark Folk said in a statement. “We look forward to continuing our relationship.” On Monday, Wells Fargo said it would claw back an additional $75 million of compensation from the executives it blamed most for the accounts scandal, former Chief Executive John Stumpf and former community banking chief Carrie Tolstedt. The San Francisco-based lender’s shares have nonetheless risen 16.6 percent since Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, though they now trade at their lowest level in four months. Many other banks’ shares also rose after Trump’s election. Buffett told CNBC television on Feb. 27 that Wells Fargo made a “huge mistake” by not immediately addressing the unauthorized accounts, and that letting the problem mushroom made its reputation suffer. Wells Fargo is expected on Thursday to report a decline in first-quarter profit, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

251,BRKa,"UPDATE 5-In proxy fight, Greenlight says GM misrepresented its stock plan","DETROIT/BOSTON (Reuters) - Greenlight Capital nominated three directors to General Motors Co’s (GM.N) board on Wednesday and accused the company of misrepresenting to ratings agencies the prominent hedge fund’s proposal to split the automaker’s common stock into two classes. Greenlight manager David Einhorn told Reuters on Wednesday the automaker has refused to allow him to present his proposal to credit agencies for a formal review of how the plan would affect the company’s credit risk. “We think the credit rating process has been unfairly manipulated,” Einhorn said. “We call on GM to allow us to work directly with the credit rating agencies.”    GM fired back that any suggestion the automaker had failed to share Greenlight’s proposal in full with the ratings agencies was “baseless and irresponsible.” Einhorn went public with a proposal in late March that the U.S. automaker create one class of stock that pays a dividend and one that does not, but would be tied to GM’s potential growth. The move would lower the company’s cost of capital, improve financial flexibility and boost market capitalization by as much as $38 billion, Einhorn said.  No other GM shareholder has yet backed Einhorn’s proposal, with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) remaining conspicuously silent.   GM has rebuffed Einhorn’s proposal, saying it would not help  the automaker “sell more cars, drive higher profitability, or generate greater cash flow.” Both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s have declared such a structure could hurt its credit rating.  When asked whether Einhorn’s claims on Wednesday changed anything, an S&P; Global Ratings spokesman referred Reuters to the agency’s previous opinion from late March.  The views of the rating agencies are a key element in the proxy fight that will play out over the next several weeks, unless GM and Einhorn can reach a settlement. In the interview, Einhorn said his plan would also allow GM to preserve more of its cash reserves, at a time when some analysts are concerned the U.S. auto industry is heading into a cyclical slowdown. “Our proposal is an elegant way to unlock that kind of value without drawing on the cash resources of the company,” Einhorn said. Greenlight Capital has owned GM shares on and off for five years and now has a 4.9 percent stake, including options.  GM stock has performed poorly versus its peers and compared with the broader market. GM shares traded on Wednesday afternoon at $34 - just a dollar above the IPO price when the company went public in 2010 after a government-led bankruptcy. The disagreement became a full-fledged proxy fight on Wednesday as Greenlight said GM’s advisers had no interest “in performing an objective analysis” of Einhorn’s proposal. In a regulatory filing, Greenlight said GM had then “substantially altered” the term sheet for its proposal before handing it to the ratings agencies and that this different version included “various misrepresentations” of the plan. GM said in a statement: “The rating agencies’ public statements issued regarding the Greenlight proposal clearly indicate that they understood the idea in all its facets, and would represent a credit negative if implemented. Any suggestion to the contrary is baseless and irresponsible.” Greenlight on Wednesday nominated former AT&T; Broadband (T.N) Chief Executive Officer Leo Hindery, longtime Greenlight research director Vinit Sethi and Consol Energy Inc (CNX.N) Chairman William Thorndike to the automaker’s board of directors.   Einhorn himself was not on the proposed slate. Sethi was involved in talks with GM on Greenlight’s proposal going back to last September. Einhorn’s fund has returned an annualized 16 percent since the firm’s launch in 1996 but its gains have been more muted recently with an increase of only 1.5 percent in the first three months of 2017.  Einhorn’s fight with GM marks the first time since taking on Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in 2013 that the closely watched fund manager has pressed management publicly to make changes, taking a page from the playbooks of so-called activist hedge funds like Jana Partners and Pershing Square Capital Management. GM has not yet published a date for its annual shareholder’s meeting, but in previous years it has usually been held in the first half of June.   A majority of investors surveyed by Evercore ISI just after Einhorn disclosed his proposal said it would not raise GM’s value.  Greenlight’s filing comes just two days after luxury electric car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) surpassed GM to become the highest-valued U.S. automaker despite selling around 76,000 vehicles last year to GM’s 10 million.

Berkshire said it concluded after several months of talks with Fed representatives that boosting its stake in Wells Fargo “would materially restrict our commercial activity” with the bank. It also said “investment or valuation considerations” were not factors in the sales. Wells Fargo has been beset by a scandal over its creation of unauthorized customer accounts.

254,BRKa,"UPDATE 5-Wells Fargo's profit flat as costs, mortgages weigh","(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co posted flat quarterly earnings on Thursday and warned its costs would remain elevated as the fallout from a sales practices scandal continues to impact the third-largest U.S. bank. Higher personnel costs and legal fees as well as lower mortgage banking revenues kept Wells Fargo’s first-quarter net income broadly flat at $5.5 billion and the San Francisco-based bank said expenses as a share of revenues would remain high. Wells Fargo is trying to put a scandal over the opening of unauthorized accounts behind it and earlier this week said it would claw back an additional $75 million of compensation from the two former executives it blamed most for the debacle. Known for consistently growing revenues and earnings in the post-crisis era, Wells Fargo has been thrown off course by the sales controversy and in recent quarters has also been disadvantaged by its smaller trading footprint. Wall Street rivals have bounced back as bond and currency markets roared back to life last year with JPMorgan and Citi each reporting a 17 percent increase in quarterly profit on Thursday, beating analyst expectations and boosting their shares. Wells Fargo’s revenues fell about 1 percent to $22 billion and missed the average estimate of $22.32 billion. On a per share basis, profit rose to $1.00 from 99 cents a year earlier, beating the average analyst estimate of 97 cents. Chief Executive Tim Sloan told analysts he expected new account and credit card openings to recover in the third quarter after a steady decline since the sales scandal broke in September but the bank said costs associated with the controversy, which were $80 million in the first quarter, would remain around $70 million to $80 million for an unspecified period. “I think it will be at least a few more quarters,” Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said in an interview with Reuters. The bank’s efficiency ratio, a closely watched number reflecting non-interest expenses as a percentage of revenue, was 62.7 percent, compared with 58.7 percent a year ago and Sloan said it would be a challenge to get back to a preferred 55 to 59 percent level. “I want to make it very clear that operating at this level is not acceptable,” he said. Sloan added that the bank will unveil at its investor day in May additional cost savings initiatives beyond the annual $2 billion in savings they are targeting starting in 2018. The bank also plans to reduce headcount in businesses such as mortgage if, as expected, business gets slower. Sloan faces a rocky shareholder meeting on April 25 after influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services called on investors to vote against 12 out of 15 directors, including Chairman Stephen Sanger. The bank’s stock was down 2.5 percent at mid-afternoon on Thursday, the worst performer in the S&P; 500 Financials Index. After the close on Wednesday, Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Wells Fargo’s largest shareholder, said it withdrew an application to the Federal Reserve to boost its ownership stake above 10 percent, and is instead selling 9 million shares to keep it below that threshold. The Federal Reserve’s decision to hike interest rates in March for the second time in three months has been welcomed by banks which earn more from lending out their deposits when rates rise. Higher rates helped Wells Fargo earn more from lending with a 5 percent rise to $12.3 billion in its net interest income. But higher rates can also put off borrowers, and Wells had a decline in total loans to $958 billion from nearly $968 billion in the prior quarter with a near $8 billion drop in consumer loans in that period. Wells Fargo’s mortgage business, the largest in the United States by volume, saw a 23 percent drop in fee income to $1.23 billion as customers shied away from refinancing their home loans. Mortgage borrowing was likewise a dark spot in JPMorgan’s results, with mortgage fees and loan servicing revenue tumbling 39 percent to $406 million from $667 million. Wells’ consumer business is also feeling the impact from its unauthorized accounts scandal with a steady decline in the number of consumers opening checking and credit card accounts. Overall net profit at its retail bank, its biggest profit center, fell 9 percent due to a drop in fee income. Wells’ wholesale banking division, which provides loans and other services to corporate clients, reported a 10 percent increase in net profit from a year ago. Costs at Wells Fargo rose 6 percent compared to the year-ago period as the bank shelled out more for salaries as well as the legal costs related to the scandal.

258,BRKa,High-stakes vote on Wells Fargo board also tests proxy adviser ISS,"BOSTON (Reuters) - A high-stakes shareholder vote at Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) next week will determine whether the bank has done enough to retain investor confidence after its phony-account scandal, and whether a leading proxy adviser wields enough clout to help oust most of its board. In one of its toughest shareholder notes, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommended earlier this month that investors vote against 12 of the 15 directors on Wells Fargo’s ballot at the company’s annual meeting on April 25, including independent chairman Stephen Sanger. ISS argued they had all failed in their oversight duties. The recommendation was another blow to the country’s third-largest bank, which has been struggling for months to move past revelations that thousands of employees created as many as 2 million accounts in customers’ names without permission to hit lofty sales targets. ISS’s recommendation followed one by Glass Lewis, its closest competitor, which recommended votes against six directors for similar reasons.   The ball is now in the shareholders’ court. A sampling of investors who spoke to Reuters were split on how to vote. It would be extremely unusual for most directors at a company the size of Wells Fargo to turn over suddenly, without pressure from an activist investor, but ISS’s scathing review was also rare. According to Proxy Insight, among the 2,780 meetings held by S&P; 500 companies since 2012, ISS has recommended votes against 80 percent or more of directors in just seven cases besides Wells Fargo. Each involved a special circumstance, like only a few directors being up for re-election. ISS’s Wells Fargo recommendation was “among the harshest that I can recall,” said Bruce Goldfarb, president of proxy solicitation firm Okapi Partners.  An ISS spokesman declined to comment. Wells Fargo representatives cited an April 7 statement calling the ISS recommendation “extreme and unprecedented.” ISS is the largest proxy adviser, with about 1,700 clients versus Glass Lewis’s 1,200, and has faced concerns it wields undue influence over corporate elections. On average, directors who ISS recommends “against” receive 17 percent to 18 percent less support, according to consulting firm Semler Brossy. Activists have criticized big fund managers for blindly following ISS. Institutional investors have built up large corporate governance departments in recent years and say they make their own judgments. But breaking with ISS and supporting the whole Wells Fargo board could be difficult for fund firms, said Michael Goldstein, a Babson College finance professor. “This may be one of those cases where you don’t want to have to answer a lot of questions about why did you support these people,” Goldstein said.     If shareholders do vote against some of Wells Fargo’s directors, it does not mean they will immediately leave. The bank’s guidelines require directors offer to resign if they fail to receive a majority of votes cast, but leaves the board wiggle room in deciding whether to accept a resignation. In other cases with fewer directors at risk, shareholder sentiment mattered. Some of JPMorgan Chase & Co’s (JPM.N) directors resigned in 2013 when they won only narrow majorities after the “London Whale” trading scandal.  Directors who fail to win majorities are in an even weaker position buy may not leave right away. For instance, two Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) directors received less than 30 percent support at its annual meeting in mid-2012 and offered to resign. The board accepted the resignation of one director two weeks later and did not accept the resignation of the other until the following March. Wells Fargo’s board and management have said the steps taken to fix problems and punish employees responsible for sales abuses show there is now strong oversight, and that directors nominated deserve to be elected. In an interview with Bloomberg TV on Wednesday, Wells Fargo Chief Executive Tim Sloan said ousting most of the board would be “crazy.” The San Francisco-based bank paid $190 million in a September regulatory settlement for the unauthorized accounts, igniting a public firestorm that hammered its shares and led to the resignation of then-Chairman and CEO John Stumpf. Since then, Sloan replaced Stumpf, and Sanger became the independent chairman. The board took steps like eliminating sales goals, revamping its compensation structure and withholding or clawing back tens of millions of dollars of bonuses. Shareholders interviewed in recent days voiced a range of views about whether Wells Fargo’s board needs an overhaul. Top investor Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) has already voted in favor of the board. Other big shareholders, including State Street Corp (STT.N) and Vanguard Group declined to comment or did not respond to questions. Rhode Island Treasurer Seth Magaziner, who oversees funds that own Wells Fargo shares, said they will vote against directors flagged by ISS. “Directors are meant to be agents for the shareholders, and watchdogs for the investors,” he said. “Clearly that level of oversight was lacking at Wells Fargo.” Others were supportive. Gideon Bernstein, partner at wealth management firm Leisure Capital, said he plans to back the board. He was impressed with the bank’s April 10 report describing what went wrong, and actions taken in response. “The board has done a really good job drilling down,” he said. Thomas Russo, managing member at Gardner, Russo & Gardner, said he has not yet decided how to vote. He wants to see a smaller board with more banking experience. “There’s an elevated sense of urgency in a smaller board and a board that has more specific knowledge,” he said. Executives at American Century Investments also have not yet decided. Senior investment analyst Adam Krenn said the bank’s oversight and initial response was lacking. But portfolio manager Michael Liss praised the eventual response. “Even though they were late in reacting, they certainly came down strong,” he said.

Leaders of the largest U.S. state pension system, known as CalPERS, said in an email it is voting about 13.9 million shares against the bank nominees, including its chairman, Stephen Sanger, ahead of the bank’s April 25 meeting in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. Wells Fargo is based in San Francisco. “We believe these directors failed in their oversight responsibilities during the retail banking controversy at the company,” CalPERS said in a statement posted on its website. In addition, CalPERS said some Wells Fargo (WFC.N) director nominees have tenures of 12 years or more, “which we believe could compromise director independence.” Separately, in a statement sent by a spokesman, the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, or CalSTRS, said on Friday it voted its 11.6 million Wells Fargo shares against the same group of nine directors. According to the statement, “These board members bear responsibility for the failure of oversight of sales practices at Wells Fargo.” The comments underscore the challenge facing the country’s third-largest bank, which has struggled to move past revelations that thousands of employees created as many as 2 million accounts in customers’ names without permission in order to hit lofty sales targets. Wells Fargo’s board and management have said steps already taken to fix problems and punish employees responsible for sales abuses show there is now strong oversight and that directors nominated deserve to be elected. While the board has gained support from its largest investor, Berkshire Hathaway Inc, it also faces a recommendation to vote against 12 directors by leading proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services. CalPERS is the 52nd largest shareholder of Wells Fargo and CalSTRS is the 62nd largest, according to Thomson Reuters data.

263,BRKa,UPDATE 3-Greenlight Capital: GM investors will 'vote with their wallets',"BOSTON/DETROIT (Reuters) - Greenlight Capital, which has been pressuring General Motors Co to restructure its share class, said on Tuesday it believed the automaker’s shareholders will vote in their best financial interests and support the hedge fund’s two-class stock proposal and nominees for the board. A representative for GM said Greenlight’s proposal to create two classes of stock represents an “unacceptable risk and is not in the best interests of shareholders.” In a broad-ranging letter to investors about the first quarter of 2017, seen by Reuters, Greenlight also said it had added three new long positions and exited several short positions. Greenlight is run by billionaire investor David Einhorn.  Greenlight added bets on Conduent Inc, Perrigo Co Plc and an unnamed European financial institution. The hedge fund said it lost money on bets against three Canadian banks. Greenlight has contended for some time that GM shares are undervalued and says it has a plan to boost the automaker’s valuation. A spokesman for Greenlight, Jonathan Gasthalter, declined to comment.  Einhorn proposed in late March that the U.S. automaker create one class of stock that pays a dividend and one that does not, but would be tied to GM’s potential growth. No other GM shareholder has backed Einhorn’s proposal, with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc remaining conspicuously silent. Moody’s Investors Service and S&P; Global Ratings said such a structure could hurt the automaker’s credit rating.  Einhorn has since floated three nominees for GM’s board and accused the automaker of misrepresenting his plan to rating agencies, a claim GM has rejected. “We believe others recognize that the stock is deeply undervalued and when shareholders grasp the math and the extent of GM’s behavior, they will vote with their wallets and for needed change at the Board level,” the letter dated April 25 said. GM shares closed 0.2 percent higher at $33.99 on Tuesday. Greenlight also said that Tesla Inc, the electric carmaker that earlier this month briefly passed GM as the most valuable U.S. automaker, was overvalued.  Greenlight said in the letter that sooner or later what it called the Tesla bubble was bound to burst.  “There was no catalyst that we know of that burst the dot-com bubble in March 2000, and we don’t have a particular catalyst in mind here,” the letter said. “That said, the top will be the top and it’s hard to predict when it will happen.”  ",4252017,http://www.reuters.com/article/hedgefunds-greenlight/update-3-greenlight-capital-gm-investors-will-vote-with-their-wallets-idUSL1N1HX1A2
264,BRKa,"For Wells Fargo directors, narrow wins may not be enough","April 25 (Reuters) - A shareholder vote scheduled for Tuesday could throw Wells Fargo & Co’s leadership into question if many directors, criticized for their slow response to the bank’s phony-account scandal, fail to win solid majorities. A dozen of the 15 directors on the ballot face negative recommendations from influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), which argued the group, including Chairman Stephen Sanger, failed in their oversight duties. Technically Wells Fargo’s guidelines require that directors offer to resign if they fail to receive a majority of votes cast. But in practice, directors who win with less than 80 percent support should consider exiting the board, said Charles Elson, a University of Delaware expert on corporate governance. “If they’re below 80 (percent) I’d say they have a lot of soul-searching to do,” he said. Spokesmen for the bank and Wells Fargo’s board said on Monday that they would not comment ahead of the meeting. But the country’s third-largest bank has struggled for months to move past revelations that thousands of employees created as many as 2.1 million accounts in customers’ names without their permission to hit lofty sales targets. The bank’s board and management have said steps taken to fix problems and punish employees responsible for abuses show there is now strong oversight, and that directors nominated deserve to be elected. But the public firestorm that hammered its shares and led to the resignation of then-Chairman and Chief Executive John Stumpf last year is not forgotten. At most S&P; 500 companies, director support averages around 95 percent of votes cast, according to pay consulting firm Semler Brossy. Typically a recommendation from ISS that investors vote “against” a director will reduce the support they receive by an average of 17 to 18 percentage points. Not all of Wells Fargo’s critics are in lockstep, meaning some directors may do better than others. California’s two largest public pension funds, for instance, have said they oppose only nine Wells Fargo directors. “We do want a core of directors left able to reconstitute the board,” said Anne Simpson, Calpers’ investment director of sustainability. “Simply declaring ‘off with their heads’ is not reasonable.” Should Wells Fargo directors win narrow majorities - between 50 to 80 percent of votes cast - the board would have to decide whether to accept any individual director’s resignation. University of Pennsylvania law professor Jill Fisch said a likely outcome, in the event of a close vote, would be for the board to bring in fresh faces over a period of months or longer. “From a business perspective that may be the best response you could make,” she said. “You don’t want the whole leadership to be in flux.” Banks can be sensitive to narrow wins. Goldman Sachs Group Inc, for instance, revamped its pay structure this year after 33 percent of votes cast went against executive compensation packages in 2016. Wells Fargo’s top investor Berkshire Hathaway Inc has already voted in favor of the bank’s board. Representatives for other top shareholders declined to comment. If the whole Well Fargo board receives a narrow majority, Vining Sparks analyst Marty Mosby expects few changes, saying it would be impractical to get rid of a nearly full slate of directors. But low vote totals concentrated on certain directors would likely force them to step down soon, he said. The board would have sent a stronger reform signal by naming former banking regulator Elizabeth Duke as chair when it split the chairman and CEO roles in October, Mosby said. “The only thing they haven’t really changed substantially is the board,” he said. “That last step would have completed the whole process and made this vote much easier on them.” (Reporting by Ross Kerber in Boston and Dan Freed in New York; Editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Tom Brown)",4252017,http://www.reuters.com/article/wells-fargo-accounts-meeting/for-wells-fargo-directors-narrow-wins-may-not-be-enough-idUSL1N1HT166
265,BRKa,Berkshire's Duracell sues over gray market battery imports,"(Reuters) - Duracell, a unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), on Thursday filed a lawsuit accusing a Missouri wholesaler of illegally selling gray market versions of its copper-top alkaline batteries. According to a complaint filed in federal court in Chicago, JRS Ventures Inc is importing and selling batteries made in China that were intended for sale only to Duracell’s original equipment manufacturers, to be packaged with products such as appliances and remote controls. Duracell, which long used the tagline “no regular battery looks like it or lasts like it,” said JRS’s batteries do look like its own but come in packaging that does not mention Duracell’s 10-year guarantee or how to obtain customer service. Chicago-based Duracell said it learned of the alleged infringement in March, and said that JRS refused its demand to stop selling the infringing batteries. Purchasers of the infringing batteries “are likely to be confused and indeed disappointed,” Duracell said. “Further, such sales of infringing products cause great damage to Duracell and greatly damage the goodwill in Duracell’s valuable trademarks.” JRS, based in the St. Louis suburb of O’Fallon, had no immediate comment when reached by phone and did not immediately respond to a separate email seeking comment. Duracell is seeking a halt to JRS’s alleged infringement, plus unspecified punitive and triple damages. Berkshire, which is based in Omaha, Nebraska, acquired Duracell from Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) in February 2016.

268,BRKa,"UPDATE 1-Green car sales hit by China subsidy cut, denting Buffett-backed BYD","(adds context throughout) BEIJING, April 28 (Reuters) - Chinese automaker BYD Co Ltd , backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, expects a fall of up to 31.4 percent in first-half net profit as Beijing’s cut to subsidies slows green car sales slow in China. Shenzhen-based BYD, which specializes in green energy cars, forecast a 20.3 percent to 31.4 percent fall in net profit for the first half to 1.55 billion to 1.8 billion yuan ($261.10 million), in what would be the biggest drop in first half profits since 2012, according to Reuters data. “The scale back of subsidies on new energy vehicles put pressure on profit, while competition will still be intense in traditional vehicle sectors in the second quarter,” BYD said in a stock exchange statement released on Friday. BYD’s weakening net profits are a marked shift from massive profit growth over the last two years, annual net income increased more than 10-fold from 2014 to 2016, as demand for green cars boomed thanks to aggressive government support. But demand has wavered this year as the central government has cut its massive subsidy payouts for green cars by 20 percent, raised barriers to entry for new electric car models and debated easing proposed quotas for plug-in cars. For the first quarter, BYD reported 605.8 million yuan in profit, a 28.8 percent decrease year-on-year, in line its forecast last month of a 24-35 percent fall. Sales of plug-in hybrid and battery electric cars fell nearly 5 percent in January to March compared with the same period a year ago, China’s Association of Automobile Manufacturers said.

270,BRKa,"Despite record highs, fund managers globally remain underweight Apple","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Active stock fund managers around the world are holding the lowest percentage of Apple Inc (AAPL.O) shares in their portfolios when compared to the iPhone maker’s overall weighting in indexes, even as the shares hit record highs, according to a research note by investment bank UBS late Monday. The current positioning by investors suggests Apple stock has room to run as portfolio managers chase performance. This should give Apple more fuel even after it rallied 56.4 percent in the 12 months leading up to Monday’s close. “Active fund managers as a whole continue to underperform their benchmarks and are not going to want to leave a lot of performance on the table if they continue to see this company rally,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, an independent research firm in New York.   Only about a third of large-cap core mutual funds are ahead of the 6.7 percent gain in the benchmark S&P; 500 index for the year to date, leaving portfolio managers struggling to prove their worth at a time when low-priced index funds and exchange traded funds that mimic benchmarks continue to take market share, Rosenbluth said. The UBS ranking was based on institutional investment in individual stocks. The total dollar holdings in a stock were compared to the size of the overall fund portfolio to calculate the stock’s “investor weight.” This was later compared with “the relevant equity index benchmark to form the active weight.” For its part, global fund managers’ “investor weight” of Apple stood at 1.3 percent while their “active weight” positioning was negative 0.6 percent, UBS data showed. In a regulatory filing, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reported owning 57.4 million shares of Apple as of Dec. 31, up from just from 15.2 million shares three months earlier. Shares of Apple are up about 26.8 percent for the year to date in anticipation of a new iPhone model expected to be released in September marking the 10th anniversary of its flagship product.  Sales of the iPhone, which account for 69.4 percent of Apple’s total revenue, were larger than expected in the quarter that ended Dec. 31, helping mitigate concerns about consumers switching to cheaper alternatives or holding on to their current phones longer. “You’re not seeing a slowdown in demand ahead of a major upgrade year, and there’s a potential for higher costs and margins with the new model,” said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors. Apple reports second-quarter results after the closing bell.

271,BRKa,Buffett to face big crowd as Berkshire grows bigger,"(Reuters) - As the United States adapts to the presidency of Donald Trump and faces rising tensions abroad, Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) shareholders will descend on Omaha, Nebraska this weekend seeking reassurance, from Warren Buffett. The weekend known as “Woodstock for Capitalists” is unique in corporate America, a celebration of the billionaire’s image and success at a conglomerate whose businesses range from Geico insurance to the BNSF railroad to See’s candies to Ginsu knives. Buffett, 86, and vice chairman Charlie Munger, 93, will answer five hours of questions at Saturday’s annual meeting. Many say it reinforces their views about investing and Berkshire, even if it remains unclear how much new they learn. “Watching someone like (Buffett) with strong command on details of the economy and Berkshire’s operations is very impressive,” said Meyer Shields, a Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst who rates Berkshire “market perform.” “But you’re not going to learn a lot about Berkshire Hathaway the company.” Last year’s attendance fell to about 37,000 from more than 40,000 a year earlier. But there were also 1.1 million real-time sign-ons to Yahoo Finance, which webcast the meeting for the first time. It will do so again, in English and Mandarin. Much of Berkshire’s relative outperformance came decades ago when it was much smaller, and even Buffett has called the company’s huge size an “anchor on investment performance.” Buffett has said Berkshire owns 10 businesses big enough to make the Fortune 500 list of large U.S. companies on their own. But details can be thin. For example, aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts, acquired last year for $32.1 billion, merited about a page in Berkshire’s annual report. Precision’s final annual report, in 2015, ran 87 pages. “It’s a large, large organization,” said Jeffrey Stacey, founder of Stacey Muirhead Capital Management in Waterloo, Ontario, who is attending his 26th straight meeting. “I am willing to give it the benefit of the doubt because the track record has been so good for so long.” Buffett said in February that boosting disclosure could put many Berkshire businesses at a disadvantage, and that “it’s the growth of the Berkshire forest that counts.” He also knows the perils of conglomerates, saying in 2015 that dubious accounting, self-promotion and mediocre businesses make them “richly deserve” their “terrible” reputation. Buffett says Berkshire is different, in part because he took Munger’s advice to buy wonderful businesses at fair prices. Shareholders enjoy that focus less than they once did. Berkshire's share price has slightly lagged the Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX including dividends during the eight-year bull market, but has outperformed since the global financial crisis mushroomed in September 2008.         Shields, who is not attending Saturday’s meeting, wants Buffett to reveal more, even if shareholders can “safely assume” his eventual successor as chief executive is top-flight. While Buffett and Munger do not know in advance the questions they will get from shareholders, journalists and analysts at Saturday’s meeting, they can anticipate many. Buffett may need to review Berkshire’s support of Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), in which it holds a roughly 10 percent stake, despite a sales scandal over bogus customer accounts. He may also get questions about his support for 3G Capital, a Brazilian firm known for ruthless cost-cutting. Berkshire controls Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) with 3G, and recently tried to help 3G buy Unilever NV (UNc.AS) (ULVR.L) for $143 billion. Trump is sure to come up. Buffett did not support his election but Berkshire’s book value could swell by $36 billion with his proposed corporate tax cuts, Barclays Capital said. Buffett may also get questions about his surprise bets on Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and the four biggest U.S. airlines. Having gone over a year since a big acquisition, Buffett may be asked how he can better deploy the $86.4 billion of cash, equivalents and Treasury bills that Berkshire recently held. Succession may also come up. Indeed, Buffett has already delegated work to lieutenants like Ajit Jain, Gregory Abel, Tracy Britt Cool and Todd Combs that he once would do himself.

275,BRKa,CORRECTED-S&P; 500 tech index edges toward $5 trillion while Apple steals spotlight,"NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - While some investors have been waiting for Apple’s market capitalization to reach $1 trillion, those looking for big round numbers might be better off looking to the S&P; 500 technology index as a whole, which is approaching the $5 trillion mark. The S&P; 500 technology index, which includes Apple Inc, will hit $5 trillion in about two months if its growth of 16 percent so far in 2017 continues at the same pace.  Apple is already the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, and its weight within the S&P; 500 in recent decades has been rivaled only by Exxon Mobil and Microsoft.  The iPhone maker’s market capitalization recently reached a record $774 billion after increasing 27 percent so far in 2017. If Apple continues to grow at that rate, its market capitalization will hit $1 trillion in October. “Investors see the big numbers, the hoopla surrounding hitting one of these arbitrary levels...” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. “Hitting those milestones often attracts more investors,” she added. Apple accounted for as much as 4.9 percent of the S&P; 500 in September 2012, but its share of the index has since slipped to 3.8 percent. In comparison, Exxon Mobil accounted for 5.3 percent of the S&P; 500 in December 2008, while Microsoft briefly accounted for 4.9 percent of the index in 2000.  Apple recently accounted for 15.1 percent of the S&P; 500 technology index, down from a peak of 21.8 percent in 2012. The technology index recently traded at 17.4 times expected earnings, down a little from a month ago but otherwise near highs not seen since 2008, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.  Shares of Apple edged down 0.3 percent on Wednesday after the company reported its March-quarter results on Tuesday and said sales of iPhones fell, surprising investors.  Still, at least four analysts raised their share price target for Apple.   While global smartphone sales have lost steam in recent years, investors remain optimistic that Apple will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone with new models that give a major boost to sales.   The median analyst 12-month price target for Apple on Wednesday was $160. Hitting that target implies a 9 percent rise from current levels, which would put Apple’s market capitalization at $836 billion, excluding the effect of potential stock buybacks. Still, analyst price targets are a poor predictor of stock performance, and a stock’s past performance often says little about what it will do in the future. In February, Warren Buffett told CNBC that Apple was likely to hit a $1 trillion market value before his own holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, which has a market value of $410 billion after its stock rose 2 percent so far in 2017.  Steep stock gains driven by optimism about upcoming iPhones are unlikely to continue at the same pace, said Shebly Seyrafi, analyst at FBN Securities. But he recommends the stock and even increased his own price target to $160 from $155 following Apple’s quarterly report.  “It’s a value play that should be bought at current levels,” Seyrafi said.

276,BRKa,Insurance dampens Berkshire results before annual meeting,"OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), the conglomerate run by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, reported a 27 percent decline in first-quarter profit on Friday, and said a loss from insurance underwriting contributed to operating results that fell short of forecasts. The results were released one day before Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett, 86, and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 93, will answer five hours of questions from shareholders, journalists and analysts. That meeting is the centerpiece of a festive weekend of events throughout Omaha expected to draw more than 37,000 shareholders. Net income fell to $4.06 billion, or $2,469 per Class A share, from $5.59 billion, or $3,401, a year earlier, when Berkshire had a $1.9 billion gain from its swap of its Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) stock for the Duracell battery business. Quarterly operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses, fell 5 percent to a three-year low of $3.56 billion, or $2,163 per Class A share, from $3.74 billion, or $2,274. Analysts on average expected operating profit of about $2,666 per Class A share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Buffett believes Berkshire’s investment and derivative gains in any given quarter are often meaningless, but accounting rules require Berkshire to report them in its earnings statements. Despite the earnings shortfall, Buffett’s preferred measure of growth for Berkshire, book value per Class A share, or assets minus liabilities, rose 3.5 percent in the quarter to $178,073. The conglomerate also ended the quarter with roughly $96.5 billion of cash, equivalents and Treasury bills, a record sum and enough for one or more major acquisitions. Berkshire has more than 90 operating units in insurance, chemical, energy, food and clothing, railroad and other sectors, and also has large investments in stocks of companies such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N). Many Berkshire units are selling their wares at discounted prices at the annual meeting, while others offer memorabilia such as “Berky” boxers and bras, talking Warren Buffett dolls, and rubber ducks that look like Buffett and Munger for $5 a pair. Buffett has led Berkshire since 1965. Berkshire said its insurance businesses swung to a $267 million underwriting loss from a year-earlier profit of $213 million. This reflected higher losses from catastrophes in 2017, including an Australian cyclone in March; unexpectedly high losses related to hurricanes and earthquakes in 2016, and weaker results at the auto insurer Geico and the reinsurer General Re. It also reflected the amortization of deferred charges from Berkshire’s January agreement to take on many long-term risks in American International Group Inc’s (AIG.N) property and casualty portfolio, in exchange for $10.2 billion upfront. That payment helped boost float, or the amount of insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and which helps fund Berkshire’s growth, to about $105 billion from $91 billion at the end of 2016. It also helped boost quarterly revenue 25 percent to $65.19 billion. Quarter-to-quarter swings “are about the mix of business and what is coming due, and what is being renewed,” said Cole Smead, portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management in Seattle. “This is not a disaster.” It is unclear whether Berkshire booked losses as Buffett began selling some of its stock in IBM Corp (IBM.N), which it has owned for about six years.  Buffett told CNBC on Thursday he sold about one-third of Berkshire’s 81 million share stake in IBM this year, and no longer values the computer services company as highly as before. In other businesses, the BNSF railroad saw profit rise 7 percent to $838 million, helped by higher revenue from fuel surcharges and increased shipments of consumer products. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility unit mostly owned by Berkshire, saw profit rise 14 percent to $501 million, helped by lower pension and maintenance costs at the PacifiCorp electric utility and a better rate structure for natural gas pipeline operator Kern River. In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares rose 0.2 percent to $250,000 and its Class B shares rose 0.1 percent to $166.55. The shares are roughly 6 percent below record highs set on March 2.

278,BRKa,Warren Buffett says he sold a third of stake in IBM: CNBC,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett said he has sold about one-third of Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s (BRKa.N) big stake in IBM Corp (IBM.N), CNBC reported on Thursday, reducing a bet by the famed investor that surprised many and which so far has yet to prove successful. IBM’s stock touched $180 on Feb 14 and reached a high of $182.78 during Feb. 16 trading. It closed on Thursday at $159.05 on the New York Stock Exchange. Berkshire and Buffett’s assistant did not immediately respond to telephone and email requests for comment. IBM could not be reached for comment outside regular business hours. Buffett owned about 81 million shares of IBM at the end of 2016 and sold about a third in the first and second quarters of 2017, CNBC reported, citing Buffett. “I don’t value IBM the same way that I did six years ago when I started buying ... I’ve revalued it somewhat downward,” Buffett told CNBC in an interview. The IBM investment was initially viewed as a surprise, given Berkshire’s longstanding underweighting in the technology sector and Buffett’s resistance to investing in businesses he considered more difficult to understand. The IBM stake had grown to be one of Berkshire’s largest stock investments, along with such companies as American Express (AXP.N), Coca-Cola (COKE.O), Wells Fargo (WFC.N), and more recently Apple (AAPL.O) and Kraft Heinz (KHC.O). Buffett has long been willing to sell stock investments, as opposed to entire businesses, when they do not pan out or he finds something better. “IBM is a big strong company, but they’ve got big strong competitors, too,” he said. Berkshire Hathaway still owns over 50 million shares of IBM and Buffett said he has stopped selling. In April, IBM reported a bigger-than-expected decline in revenue for the first time in five quarters due to weak demand in its IT services business.

283,BRKa,Buffett calls Obamacare replacement 'a huge tax cut for guys like me',"May 6 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc Chairman Warren Buffett on Saturday fumed that healthcare costs are eating away at the U.S. economy like “tapeworm” and said the Republican approach to overhaul Obamacare is a tax cut for the rich. The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday narrowly approved a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, a victory for Republican President Donald Trump who has called the 2010 law a “disaster.” Speaking at Berkshire’s annual shareholders’ meeting in Omaha, Buffett said his federal income taxes last year would have gone down 17 percent had the new law been in effect. “So it is a huge tax cut for guys like me,” he said. “And when there’s a tax cut, either the deficit goes up or they get the taxes from somebody else.” The Republican bill would repeal most of the taxes that paid for the law formally known as the Affordable Care Act. The party’s leadership has promised that the new American Health Care Act, which faces a likely overhaul and uncertain passage in the Senate, would address growing healthcare costs. Buffett said rising healthcare costs are crippling the competitiveness of U.S. companies abroad. Unlike in many other countries where much of healthcare spending is publicly financed, employers provide health insurance coverage for nearly half of Americans and often face sky-rocketing rates. Buffett said healthcare costs have risen much faster in the United States than in the rest of the world and “will go up a lot more.” “Medical costs are the tapeworm of American economic competitiveness,” he said. “That is a problem this society is having trouble with and is going to have more trouble with.” Buffett is a Democrat who vocally supported Hillary Clinton’s unsuccessful bid for the presidency against Trump. The fourth richest man in the world with a net worth totaling $74.3 billion, according to Forbes magazine, Buffett has vowed to donate nearly his entire fortune to charity. Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger added that he thinks neither political party “can think rationally” about healthcare because they “hate each other so much.” (Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Jennifer Ablan and Mary Milliken)",5062017,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-buffett-healthcare/buffett-calls-obamacare-replacement-a-huge-tax-cut-for-guys-like-me-idUSL1N1I80MA
284,BRKa,"WRAPUP 6-Buffett assails Wells Fargo, defends 3G at wide-ranging meeting","OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), on Saturday criticized Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) for failing to stop employees from signing up customers for bogus accounts even after learning it was happening, causing a scandal. Wells Fargo, whose largest shareholder is Berkshire with a 10 percent stake worth roughly $27 billion, gave employees too much autonomy to engage in “cross-selling” multiple products to meet sales goals, Buffett said.      This “incentivized the wrong type of behavior,” and former Chief Executive John Stumpf, who lost his job over the scandal, was too slow to fix the problem, Buffett said.     Wells Fargo was among many topics discussed at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, where Buffett, 86, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 93, fielded dozens of questions from shareholders, journalists and analysts. “If there’s a major problem, the CEO will get wind of it. At that moment, that’s the key to everything. The CEO has to act,” Buffett said. “The main problem was they didn’t act when they learned about it.” Still, Buffett’s support of current management and board was key to ensuring the re-election of the entire board last month. Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk said “we agree” with Buffett’s comments, and have taken “decisive actions” to fix the problems and “make things right for customers.” Buffett likened the situation to Salomon Brothers Inc, where in 1991 he was installed as chairman to clean up a mess after the former chief executive failed to tell regulators a trader was submitting fake bids at Treasury auctions. Asked whether Berkshire’s decentralized structure could lead to a similar scandal, Buffett said “as we sit here, somebody is doing something wrong at Berkshire,” whose units employ 367,000 people. But he said Berkshire has an internal “hotline” to flag possible misbehavior, which gets 4,000 calls a year. The meeting also included discussions about Berkshire’s succession plans, its controversial partnership with Brazilian firm 3G Capital, and whether it will start paying dividends or make a monster acquisition. Buffett has said Berkshire could have a new chief executive within 24 hours if he died or could not continue, and that nothing had changed just because he praised fewer managers than usual in his February shareholder letter. He said it may have been harder to single people out because “we have never had more good managers.” But he also said it would be a “terrible mistake” if capital allocation were not the “main talent” of his successor. Buffett did lavish much praise on top insurance executive Ajit Jain, who some investors believe could be that successor, saying “nobody could possibly replace Ajit. You can’t come close.” On 3G, with which Berkshire controls Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and tried to merge it with Unilever NV (ULVR.L)(UNc.AS), Buffett acknowledged a dislike for the cost-cutting for which the Brazilian firm is known. But, he said, “it is absolutely essential to America that we become more productive, and 3G was “very good at making a business productive with fewer people.” Buffett also raised the possibility Berkshire could pay its first dividend since 1967, if “reasonably soon, even while I’m around,” the company had too much cash it could not reasonably deploy. “It could be repurchases, it could be dividends,” he said. Berkshire ended March with more than $96 billion of cash and cash-like instruments, and Munger said it could do a “$150 billion” acquisition now if it wanted. Buffett defended Berkshire’s foray into airlines, where it is a top investor in American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N). He had long disdained the industry, which had gone through many bankruptcies, but said he is confident it will not resort to “suicidally competitive” pricing strategies that could spell doom. Munger added: “You’ve got to remember railroads were a terrible business for decades and decades and decades, and then they got good.” Berkshire bought the BNSF railroad in 2010. Buffett also admitted he was wrong to think International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) “would do better” when he started amassing 81 million shares six years ago. Berkshire recently sold about one-third of those shares even as it built a huge stake in Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which Buffett said is more as a “consumer” company than a technology company. He also addressed criticism that Berkshire discloses too little about businesses such as aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, which it bought last year for $32.1 billion. “We want you to understand what you own,” he said, and “there are just a million things that are of minor importance” at Berkshire, whose market value is about $411 billion. Buffett also noted that Berkshire reported far fewer investment gains in the first quarter, which dragged on results, but said the company now has a slight preference for taking tax losses, which could lose value if Washington lawmakers reduce the 35 percent corporate tax rate. Shareholders overwhelmingly rejected a proposal that would have required Berkshire to disclose its political contributions twice a year. The annual meeting, expected to draw more than last year’s estimated 37,000 shareholders, is the main event of a weekend of events that Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists.” Buffett and Munger took questions after the traditional shareholder movie, and after Buffett had roamed a nearby exhibit hall featuring products from Berkshire companies. He was joined at the traditional newspaper tossing contest by friends including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) co-founder and Berkshire director Bill Gates and Miami Dolphins defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh. Hundreds of shareholders lined up early outside downtown Omaha’s CenturyLink Center for the meeting. Several said they got there nearly five hours before doors opened around 6:45 a.m. “Every year it seems I have to come earlier,” said Chris Tesari, a retired businessman from Pacific Palisades, California who said he arrived at 3:20 a.m. for his 21st meeting. “It’s a pilgrimage.” ",5062017,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-buffett/wrapup-6-buffett-assails-wells-fargo-defends-3g-at-wide-ranging-meeting-idUSL1N1I8078

Buffett also noted that Berkshire reported far fewer investment gains in the first quarter, which dragged on results, but said the company now has a slight preference for taking tax losses, which could lose value if Washington lawmakers reduce the 35 percent corporate tax rate. The annual meeting, expected to draw more than last year’s estimated 37,000 shareholders, is the main event of a weekend of events that Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists.” Buffett and Munger took questions after the traditional shareholder movie, and after Buffett had roamed a nearby exhibit hall featuring products from Berkshire companies. He was joined at the traditional newspaper tossing contest by friends including Microsoft Corp co-founder and Berkshire director Bill Gates, and Miami Dolphins defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh. Hundreds of shareholders lined up early outside downtown Omaha’s CenturyLink Center for the meeting. Several said they got there nearly five hours before doors opened around 6:45 a.m. “Every year it seems I have to come earlier,” said Chris Tesari, a retired businessman from Pacific Palisades, California who said he arrived at 3:20 a.m. for his 21st meeting. “It’s a pilgrimage.” ",5062017,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-buffett/update-1-buffett-assails-wells-fargo-defends-3g-at-wide-ranging-meeting-idUSL1N1I80KQ
286,BRKa,"HIGHLIGHTS-Berkshire's Warren Buffett comments on healthcare, trade, buybacks","(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) Vice Chairman Charlie Munger are answering five hours of questions from shareholders, journalists and analysts at Berkshire’s 52nd annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. The weekend known as “Woodstock for Capitalists” is unique in corporate America, a celebration of the billionaire’s image and success at a conglomerate whose businesses range from Geico insurance to the BNSF railroad to See’s candies to Ginsu knives. Below are a few of the comments from Buffett, the “Oracle of Omaha,” on a wide range of topics: “Medical costs are the tapeworm of American economic competitiveness.  “Our health costs have gone up (incredibly) and will go up a lot more ... that is a problem this society is having trouble with and is going to have more trouble with. It almost transcends (political party). “If you talk about the world competitiveness of American industry, (health costs are) the biggest single variable where we keep getting more and more out of whack with the rest of the world. “(The Obamacare repeal) is a huge tax cut for guys like me ... either the deficit goes up or they get the taxes from someone else.” “I can’t think of anything that can harm Berkshire in a material, permanent way except weapons of mass destruction. “If that ever happens, there’ll be more to worry about than the price of Berkshire.” “Who would have guessed a U.S. territory would wind up in bankruptcy? I would because they behaved like idiots.”      “I was too dumb to realize what was going to happen. “I did not think (Jeff Bezos) could succeed on the scale that he has ... I underestimated the brilliance of the execution. It takes a lot of ability. “It always looked expensive ... and I never thought he would be where he is today. “We miss a lot of things.” ON BERKSHIRE’S BREAK-UP VALUE “If I die tonight, the stock would go up tomorrow. There’d be speculation about breakups. Some of the parts might (temporarily) sell for more than the whole.” “Trade is beneficial to society but the people who see the benefits ... are getting small benefits, invisible benefits. The guy who’s getting hurt by it ... is feeling it very specifically.” “When the time comes, and it could come reasonably soon ... we have to re-examine what to do with funds that (can’t) be deployed well. It could be repurchases, it could be dividends.   “At the moment, we’re still optimistic enough about deploying the capital ... There will be markets where we can do (interesting) things on a big scale.”  “Our kids will live better than we do because America does get more productive ... It’s essential to America that we become more productive.”  “We’ve been very, very lucky in life and so far our luck seems to be holding.” “I really like teaching. If somebody thought I’d done a decent job of teaching, I’d feel pretty good about that.” “I make no pretense whatsoever of being on the same level as some 15-year-old (who has) an interest in tech.  “I’ve gained no real knowledge on tech, well, since I was born, actually.” “We could do a very large deal if we thought it was sufficiently attractive ... We spent $16 billion back when we were much smaller ... in the fall of 2008. It never (created) a problem for me sleeping at night. “Charlie and I really do not discuss sectors much ... we’re really opportunistic. We’re looking at all kinds of businesses all of the time. We’re hoping, we get a call ... and we know in the first five minutes whether (a deal) has a reasonable chance of happening. “We (like) companies where consumer behavior can be (predicted) further off. “We don’t really say we’ll go after companies in this field or that field. “If you’re (primarily) interested in getting the highest price for your business, we’re not a good call (to make).” “I looked at a company the other day and seven of the directors had never bought a share of stock ... They’ve been given a lot of stock. “What you want is a system that works well in spite of human nature. “American business overall has done very well for Americans.” “You need a sensible capital allocator in the job of being CEO of Berkshire. And we will have one. “Capital allocation probably should be close to their main talent. “Berkshire would not do well if someone was put in with skills in other areas but didn’t have the ability for capital allocation. “We certainly don’t want somebody if they lack a ‘money mind.’” “If the board hires a compensation consultant after I go, I will come back.” “I would actually hope that we would have somebody A) That’s already very rich, which they should be. Working a long time and really not motivated by whether they have 10 times as much money ... and they might even wish to set an example by engaging for something far lower.” “We’ve got two guys in the office managing ($20 billion) ... we pay them $1 million a year plus (more based on) the amount by which they beat the S&P.; ... How many hedge funds managers say, I only want to get paid if I do something for you? ... It just doesn’t happen.” “Over time, coal is essentially certain to decline as a percentage of the revenue of the (BNSF) railroad. We are looking for other sources of growth (besides) coal. “In my mind, we’re going to be shipping less coal 10 or 20 years from now. The coal aspect (of the business) is going to diminish.” “I don’t mind having 500-600 calories for dessert. I’ll let someone else have the broccoli.” ON RUNNING A HANDS-OFF CONGLOMERATE “I think our hands-off style actually can add significant value to many companies. We free up at least 20 percent of the time for a CEO (compared to running) a public company. “I think we bring something to the party.”  “When I bought IBM six years ago, I thought it would do better in the six years ... than it has. Apple is much more of a consumer products business. In terms of analyzing moats around it, consumer behavior ... they are two different types of decisions. I was wrong on the first one, and we’ll find out whether I was right on the second.  “I could be making two mistakes on IBM. It’s harder to predict in my view ... how much price competition will enter in something like cloud services.” “We missed (Amazon.com) entirely. We’ve never owned a share.” “It’s a fiercely competitive industry. The question is if it’s a suicidally competitive industry. It has been operating at 80 percent or better of capacity for some time. ... It’s fair to say they will operate at higher degrees of capacity over the next five or 10 years than at historical rates. They actually at present are earning quite high returns on invested capital, I think higher than FedEx or UPS. “It is no cinch that the industry will have more pricing sensibility in the next 10 years, but the conditions have improved for that.” “I do not think it’s easy to predict the (course) of interest rates at all.”  “It is the nature of market systems to occasionally go haywire in one direction or another. “When the rest of the world is fearful, we know America is going to come out fine.” “(Keynes said) there’s always some speculation. ... People can get very excited about speculating in markets. There’s nothing more agonizing than to see your neighbor (getting richer). Early on in the development of markets there’s probably some tendency to be more speculative than markets that have been around for a couple hundred years. Markets have a casino characteristic that has a lot of appeal.  “China being a newer market ... is likely to have some pretty extreme experiences. “Fear spreads like you cannot believe. The way the public can react is really extreme ... and that offers opportunities for investors. “Markets are there to be taken advantage of.” “I think we have one big advantage. A lot of other people are trying to be brilliant, and we’re just trying to stay rational.”   “You’re a fatter version of Mahatma Gandhi.”  “At Wells Fargo, there were three significant mistakes, but one dwarfs all of the others. ... You have to be careful what you incentivize. There was an incentive system built around cross-selling. ... That was incentivizing the wrong kind of behavior. “The main problem was they didn’t act when they learned about it.” “The realized investment gains or losses in any period really mean nothing ... We don’t really think about the timing of what we do. We do not make earnings forecasts. “I feel very good about the first quarter even though our operating earnings were down a little bit.”  “It was not in the interests of Wall Street to have the development of index funds, because it brought down fees dramatically. When Jack started, very few people, certainly Wall Street did not applaud him. He was the subject of some derision. And now we’re talking trillions when we get into index funds.  “Jack at a minimum has saved, in the pockets of investors, he’s put tens and tens and tens of billions into their pockets. It’s Jack’s 88th birthday on Monday. Happy birthday, Jack and thank you on behalf of (investors).” “Driverless trucks are a lot more of a threat than an opportunity to Burlington Northern. “Autonomous vehicles, widespread, would hurt us if they spread to trucks, and they would hurt our auto insurance business. They may be a long way off. That will depend on experience in the first early months of the introduction. If they make the world safer, it will be a very good thing but it won’t be a good thing for auto insurers.” ",5062017,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-buffett-quotes/highlights-berkshires-warren-buffett-comments-on-healthcare-trade-buybacks-idUSL1N1I80A6
287,BRKa,"Buffett downplays value clash between Berkshire, cost-cutting 3G","OMAHA, Neb., May 6 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday downplayed suggestions that Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s partnerships with Brazil’s 3G Capital, a renowned cost-cutter, undermined Berkshire’s own value system. Speaking at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett said, “there is a good chance we will do more, and perhaps bigger things” with 3G, which was co-founded by fellow billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann and which with Berkshire controls food company Kraft Heinz Co. But he acknowledged disliking imposing the kinds of deep cuts, including the loss of many thousands of jobs, for which 3G is known. “Change is painful for a lot of people, and I would rather spend my days not doing that sort of thing,” he said. “But I think it is absolutely essential to America that we become more productive.” The 3G firm is known for “zero-based budgeting,” where managers must periodically justify all their expenses, and cost controls such as requiring photocopies to be double-sided. Berkshire and 3G jointly bought H.J. Heinz Co in 2013 and merged it with Kraft Foods Group two years later. Buffett also helped finance 3G’s merger of the Burger King and Tim Hortons chains to create Restaurant Brands International Inc. More recently, Berkshire and 3G worked together on Kraft Heinz’s proposal to buy European food company Unilever NV for $143 billion, only to be turned down. Buffett revealed on Saturday that Berkshire and 3G, which together own 51 percent of Kraft Heinz, had each been prepared to devote $15 billion of cash to the transaction. He said Berkshire prefers buying companies that are already efficient, and that 3G is not alone in trying to slash costs at companies that may be less efficient. “The 3G people do it very fast, and they’re very good at making a business productive with fewer people,” he said. “But we have been doing that in every industry.” Charlie Munger, Berkshire’s vice chairman, concurred, saying at the meeting he found no “moral fault” in 3G’s approach. Buffett noted that he has had to oversee job cuts himself, citing job losses at the original Berkshire Hathaway textile business, which shut down 20 years after he took it over. “We fired 2,000 people over time ... at the textile operation,” he said. “It didn’t work.” (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in Omaha, Nebraska; Editing by Jennifer Ablan and Nick Zieminski)",5062017,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-buffett-3g/buffett-downplays-value-clash-between-berkshire-cost-cutting-3g-idUSL1N1I80GU

289,BRKa,Buffett says Trump tax proposal won't fundamentally change Berkshire,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent would be a tailwind for profitability at Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), but won’t fundamentally change how its business units operate, Buffett said. “The deferred taxes that are applicable to unrealized gains on securities would all be applicable to us,” Buffett said during Berkshire’s annual shareholders meeting on Saturday. “We have $90 or $95 billion in gains, and our owners, dollar for dollar, will participate in that ... If the rate were to drop 10 percent, that $9.5 billion is real.” Buffett, a Democrat who vocally supported Hillary Clinton’s unsuccessful White House candidacy, added that the impact of lower corporate taxes would not translate into higher profits across all of Berkshire’s many dozens of businesses. Regulated utility units, for example, are not likely to enjoy lower tax rates as savings, in Buffett’s view, would be passed onto customers. He also said that a lot of the benefits of lower corporate taxes would likely be competed away. Buffett, 86, said: “We’ve had a lot of (tax cuts) in our lifetimes … it’s certain that some of a lower corporate rate would be competed away, and it’s sure that some of it would inure to the benefit of shareholders.” In February, Barclays analyst Jay Gelb said cutting the corporate tax rate even to 20 percent could boost Berkshire’s book value by $27 billion because of a decline in its deferred tax liability. A cut to 15 percent could boost book value by $36 billion, he said. “I can’t recall sending anything out to our managers saying, ‘Let’s do this because the tax law is going to change,’” Buffett said. Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, who was also answering shareholder questions during the annual meeting, agreed with the assessment. “We’re not going to change anything at the railroad just for some little tax jiggle,” Munger said, referring to Berkshire’s BNSF unit.

291,BRKa,Buffett calls Obamacare replacement 'a huge tax cut for guys like me',"(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) Chairman Warren Buffett on Saturday fumed that healthcare costs are eating away at the U.S. economy like “tapeworm” and said the Republican approach to overhaul Obamacare is a tax cut for the rich. The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday narrowly approved a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, a victory for Republican President Donald Trump who has called the 2010 law a “disaster.” Speaking at Berkshire’s annual shareholders’ meeting in Omaha, Buffett said his federal income taxes last year would have gone down 17 percent had the new law been in effect. “So it is a huge tax cut for guys like me,” he said. “And when there’s a tax cut, either the deficit goes up or they get the taxes from somebody else.” The Republican bill would repeal most of the taxes that paid for the law formally known as the Affordable Care Act. The party’s leadership has promised that the new American Health Care Act, which faces a likely overhaul and uncertain passage  in the Senate, would address growing healthcare costs. Buffett said rising healthcare costs are crippling the competitiveness of U.S. companies abroad. Unlike in many other countries where much of healthcare spending is publicly financed, employers provide health insurance coverage for nearly half of Americans and often face sky-rocketing rates. Buffett said healthcare costs have risen much faster in the United States than in the rest of the world and “will go up a lot more.” “Medical costs are the tapeworm of American economic competitiveness,” he said. “That is a problem this society is having trouble with and is going to have more trouble with.” Buffett is a Democrat who vocally supported Hillary Clinton’s unsuccessful bid for the presidency against Trump. The fourth richest man in the world with a net worth totaling $74.3 billion, according to Forbes magazine, Buffett has vowed to donate nearly his entire fortune to charity.  Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger added that he thinks neither political party “can think rationally” about healthcare because they “hate each other so much.” ",5072017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-buffett-healthcare/buffett-calls-obamacare-replacement-a-huge-tax-cut-for-guys-like-me-idUSKBN1820RI
292,BRKa,"Buffett expresses sympathy, but Berkshire political spending proposal fails","OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) shareholders on Saturday rejected a proposal to have the conglomerate run by Warren Buffett disclose its political contributions twice a year. The billionaire nonetheless expressed sympathy for the proposal at Berkshire’s annual meeting, expressing strong opposition to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in the Citizens United case, which allowed unlimited independent spending by corporations and labor unions in election campaigns. Two shareholder proposals that would have required Berkshire to report on its efforts to reduce methane emissions, and divest stakes in companies involved in fossil fuels, were also voted down overwhelmingly. Saturday’s votes were expected because Buffett, who controls 32.7 percent of Berkshire’s voting power, opposed the proposals, and Berkshire’s board also recommended votes against them. The proposal on political contributions, which won less than 11 percent of votes cast, was similar to proposals offered at many companies and came from Clean Yield Asset Management on behalf of shareholders Tom Beers and Mary Durfee. Buffett, a supporter of Democrat Hillary Clinton in last year’s U.S. presidential election, said he believes Berkshire has made no political contributions at the parent company level in his 52 years at the helm, but some subsidiaries in heavily regulated industries “are probably going to have to make some” contributions. “I personally disagree with the Citizens United decision,” Buffett said. “I think it is a minus in our democracy, and that big money can often distort the political process.” He said he tells managers of Berkshire business units not to get personally enmeshed in political matters, but that this did not hold true for the businesses themselves. “I’m sure that they give money to people I wouldn’t vote for, but that is the reality of doing business,” he said. “My heart is with you to some extent,” he nonetheless told a woman who made the proposal on Clean Yield’s behalf. On the methane emissions proposal from shareholder Marcia Sage, Berkshire said its gas pipeline and other units have already taken steps to reduce emissions, and that a separate report was unnecessary. The fossil fuels proposal from the Nebraska Peace Foundation would have required Berkshire to sell investments in oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N) and other companies involved in fossil fuels over 12 years. Berkshire said complex social and moral issues should not determine where it could invest.

295,BRKa,"Buffett assails Wells Fargo, defends 3G at wide-ranging meeting","OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), on Saturday criticized Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) for failing to stop employees from signing up customers for bogus accounts even after learning it was happening, causing a scandal. Wells Fargo, whose largest shareholder is Berkshire with a 10 percent stake worth roughly $27 billion, gave employees too much autonomy to engage in “cross-selling” multiple products to meet sales goals, Buffett said.      This “incentivized the wrong type of behavior,” and former Chief Executive John Stumpf, who lost his job over the scandal, was too slow to fix the problem, Buffett said.     Wells Fargo was among many topics discussed at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, where Buffett, 86, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 93, fielded dozens of questions from shareholders, journalists and analysts. “If there’s a major problem, the CEO will get wind of it. At that moment, that’s the key to everything. The CEO has to act,” Buffett said. “The main problem was they didn’t act when they learned about it.” Still, Buffett’s support of current management and board was key to ensuring the re-election of the entire board last month. Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk said “we agree” with Buffett’s comments, and have taken “decisive actions” to fix the problems and “make things right for customers.” Buffett likened the situation to Salomon Brothers Inc, where in 1991 he was installed as chairman to clean up a mess after the former chief executive failed to tell regulators a trader was submitting fake bids at Treasury auctions. Asked whether Berkshire’s decentralized structure could lead to a similar scandal, Buffett said “as we sit here, somebody is doing something wrong at Berkshire,” whose units employ 367,000 people. But he said Berkshire has an internal “hotline” to flag possible misbehavior, which gets 4,000 calls a year. The meeting also included discussions about Berkshire’s succession plans, its controversial partnership with Brazilian firm 3G Capital, and whether it will start paying dividends or make a monster acquisition. Buffett has said Berkshire could have a new chief executive within 24 hours if he died or could not continue, and that nothing had changed just because he praised fewer managers than usual in his February shareholder letter. He said it may have been harder to single people out because “we have never had more good managers.” But he also said it would be a “terrible mistake” if capital allocation were not the “main talent” of his successor. Buffett did lavish much praise on top insurance executive Ajit Jain, who some investors believe could be that successor, saying “nobody could possibly replace Ajit. You can’t come close.” On 3G, with which Berkshire controls Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and tried to merge it with Unilever NV (ULVR.L)(UNc.AS), Buffett acknowledged a dislike for the cost-cutting for which the Brazilian firm is known. But, he said, “it is absolutely essential to America that we become more productive, and 3G was “very good at making a business productive with fewer people.” Buffett also raised the possibility Berkshire could pay its first dividend since 1967, if “reasonably soon, even while I’m around,” the company had too much cash it could not reasonably deploy. “It could be repurchases, it could be dividends,” he said. Berkshire ended March with more than $96 billion of cash and cash-like instruments, and Munger said it could do a “$150 billion” acquisition now if it wanted. Buffett defended Berkshire’s foray into airlines, where it is a top investor in American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N). He had long disdained the industry, which had gone through many bankruptcies, but said he is confident it will not resort to “suicidally competitive” pricing strategies that could spell doom. Munger added: “You’ve got to remember railroads were a terrible business for decades and decades and decades, and then they got good.” Berkshire bought the BNSF railroad in 2010. Buffett also admitted he was wrong to think International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) “would do better” when he started amassing 81 million shares six years ago. Berkshire recently sold about one-third of those shares even as it built a huge stake in Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which Buffett said is more as a “consumer” company than a technology company. He also addressed criticism that Berkshire discloses too little about businesses such as aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, which it bought last year for $32.1 billion. “We want you to understand what you own,” he said, and “there are just a million things that are of minor importance” at Berkshire, whose market value is about $411 billion. Buffett also noted that Berkshire reported far fewer investment gains in the first quarter, which dragged on results, but said the company now has a slight preference for taking tax losses, which could lose value if Washington lawmakers reduce the 35 percent corporate tax rate. Shareholders overwhelmingly rejected a proposal that would have required Berkshire to disclose its political contributions twice a year. The annual meeting, expected to draw more than last year’s estimated 37,000 shareholders, is the main event of a weekend of events that Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists.” Buffett and Munger took questions after the traditional shareholder movie, and after Buffett had roamed a nearby exhibit hall featuring products from Berkshire companies.

296,BRKa,"Highlights: Berkshire's Warren Buffett comments on healthcare, trade, buybacks","(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) Vice Chairman Charlie Munger are answering five hours of questions from shareholders, journalists and analysts at Berkshire’s 52nd annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. The weekend known as “Woodstock for Capitalists” is unique in corporate America, a celebration of the billionaire’s image and success at a conglomerate whose businesses range from Geico insurance to the BNSF railroad to See’s candies to Ginsu knives. Below are a few of the comments from Buffett, the “Oracle of Omaha,” on a wide range of topics: “Medical costs are the tapeworm of American economic competitiveness.  “Our health costs have gone up (incredibly) and will go up a lot more ... that is a problem this society is having trouble with and is going to have more trouble with. It almost transcends (political party). “If you talk about the world competitiveness of American industry, (health costs are) the biggest single variable where we keep getting more and more out of whack with the rest of the world. “(The Obamacare repeal) is a huge tax cut for guys like me ... either the deficit goes up or they get the taxes from someone else.” “I can’t think of anything that can harm Berkshire in a material, permanent way except weapons of mass destruction. “If that ever happens, there’ll be more to worry about than the price of Berkshire.” “Who would have guessed a U.S. territory would wind up in bankruptcy? I would because they behaved like idiots.”      “I was too dumb to realize what was going to happen. “I did not think (Jeff Bezos) could succeed on the scale that he has ... I underestimated the brilliance of the execution. It takes a lot of ability. “It always looked expensive ... and I never thought he would be where he is today. “We miss a lot of things.” ON BERKSHIRE’S BREAK-UP VALUE “If I die tonight, the stock would go up tomorrow. There’d be speculation about breakups. Some of the parts might (temporarily) sell for more than the whole.” “Trade is beneficial to society but the people who see the benefits ... are getting small benefits, invisible benefits. The guy who’s getting hurt by it ... is feeling it very specifically.” “When the time comes, and it could come reasonably soon ... we have to re-examine what to do with funds that (can’t) be deployed well. It could be repurchases, it could be dividends.   “At the moment, we’re still optimistic enough about deploying the capital ... There will be markets where we can do (interesting) things on a big scale.”  “Our kids will live better than we do because America does get more productive ... It’s essential to America that we become more productive.”  “We’ve been very, very lucky in life and so far our luck seems to be holding.” “I really like teaching. If somebody thought I’d done a decent job of teaching, I’d feel pretty good about that.” “I make no pretense whatsoever of being on the same level as some 15-year-old (who has) an interest in tech.  “I’ve gained no real knowledge on tech, well, since I was born, actually.” “We could do a very large deal if we thought it was sufficiently attractive ... We spent $16 billion back when we were much smaller ... in the fall of 2008. It never (created) a problem for me sleeping at night. “Charlie and I really do not discuss sectors much ... we’re really opportunistic. We’re looking at all kinds of businesses all of the time. We’re hoping, we get a call ... and we know in the first five minutes whether (a deal) has a reasonable chance of happening. “We (like) companies where consumer behavior can be (predicted) further off. “We don’t really say we’ll go after companies in this field or that field. “If you’re (primarily) interested in getting the highest price for your business, we’re not a good call (to make).” “I looked at a company the other day and seven of the directors had never bought a share of stock ... They’ve been given a lot of stock. “What you want is a system that works well in spite of human nature. “American business overall has done very well for Americans.” “You need a sensible capital allocator in the job of being CEO of Berkshire. And we will have one. “Capital allocation probably should be close to their main talent. “Berkshire would not do well if someone was put in with skills in other areas but didn’t have the ability for capital allocation. “We certainly don’t want somebody if they lack a ‘money mind.’” “If the board hires a compensation consultant after I go, I will come back.” “I would actually hope that we would have somebody A) That’s already very rich, which they should be. Working a long time and really not motivated by whether they have 10 times as much money ... and they might even wish to set an example by engaging for something far lower.” “We’ve got two guys in the office managing ($20 billion) ... we pay them $1 million a year plus (more based on) the amount by which they beat the S&P.; ... How many hedge funds managers say, I only want to get paid if I do something for you? ... It just doesn’t happen.” “Over time, coal is essentially certain to decline as a percentage of the revenue of the (BNSF) railroad. We are looking for other sources of growth (besides) coal. “In my mind, we’re going to be shipping less coal 10 or 20 years from now. The coal aspect (of the business) is going to diminish.” “I don’t mind having 500-600 calories for dessert. I’ll let someone else have the broccoli.” ON RUNNING A HANDS-OFF CONGLOMERATE “I think our hands-off style actually can add significant value to many companies. We free up at least 20 percent of the time for a CEO (compared to running) a public company. “I think we bring something to the party.”  “When I bought IBM six years ago, I thought it would do better in the six years ... than it has. Apple is much more of a consumer products business. In terms of analyzing moats around it, consumer behavior ... they are two different types of decisions. I was wrong on the first one, and we’ll find out whether I was right on the second.  “I could be making two mistakes on IBM. It’s harder to predict in my view ... how much price competition will enter in something like cloud services.” “We missed (Amazon.com) entirely. We’ve never owned a share.” “It’s a fiercely competitive industry. The question is if it’s a suicidally competitive industry. It has been operating at 80 percent or better of capacity for some time. ... It’s fair to say they will operate at higher degrees of capacity over the next five or 10 years than at historical rates. They actually at present are earning quite high returns on invested capital, I think higher than FedEx or UPS. “It is no cinch that the industry will have more pricing sensibility in the next 10 years, but the conditions have improved for that.” “I do not think it’s easy to predict the (course) of interest rates at all.”  “It is the nature of market systems to occasionally go haywire in one direction or another. “When the rest of the world is fearful, we know America is going to come out fine.” “(Keynes said) there’s always some speculation. ... People can get very excited about speculating in markets. There’s nothing more agonizing than to see your neighbor (getting richer). Early on in the development of markets there’s probably some tendency to be more speculative than markets that have been around for a couple hundred years. Markets have a casino characteristic that has a lot of appeal.  “China being a newer market ... is likely to have some pretty extreme experiences. “Fear spreads like you cannot believe. The way the public can react is really extreme ... and that offers opportunities for investors. “Markets are there to be taken advantage of.” “I think we have one big advantage. A lot of other people are trying to be brilliant, and we’re just trying to stay rational.”   “You’re a fatter version of Mahatma Gandhi.”  “At Wells Fargo, there were three significant mistakes, but one dwarfs all of the others. ... You have to be careful what you incentivize. There was an incentive system built around cross-selling. ... That was incentivizing the wrong kind of behavior. “The main problem was they didn’t act when they learned about it.” “The realized investment gains or losses in any period really mean nothing ... We don’t really think about the timing of what we do. We do not make earnings forecasts. “I feel very good about the first quarter even though our operating earnings were down a little bit.”  “It was not in the interests of Wall Street to have the development of index funds, because it brought down fees dramatically. When Jack started, very few people, certainly Wall Street did not applaud him. He was the subject of some derision. And now we’re talking trillions when we get into index funds.  “Jack at a minimum has saved, in the pockets of investors, he’s put tens and tens and tens of billions into their pockets. It’s Jack’s 88th birthday on Monday. Happy birthday, Jack and thank you on behalf of (investors).” “Driverless trucks are a lot more of a threat than an opportunity to Burlington Northern. “Autonomous vehicles, widespread, would hurt us if they spread to trucks, and they would hurt our auto insurance business. They may be a long way off. That will depend on experience in the first early months of the introduction. If they make the world safer, it will be a very good thing but it won’t be a good thing for auto insurers.” ",5072017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-buffett-quotes/highlights-berkshires-warren-buffett-comments-on-healthcare-trade-buybacks-idUSKBN1820IW
297,BRKa,Buffett's praise of Jack Bogle sounds self-serving,"DALLAS (Reuters Breakingviews) - Warren Buffett respects his elders. During Berkshire Hathaway’s  annual shareholder bash in Omaha on Saturday, the 86-year-old Oracle sang the praises of – and delivered early 88th birthday wishes to – Jack Bogle, the Vanguard founder who pioneered low-fee index mutual funds. While the sentiment is undoubtedly genuine, it is also starting to sound a bit self-serving. Buffett told the 40,000-strong live audience that Bogle had done “more for the American investor than any man in the country” by saving them tens of billions of dollars in unnecessary charges from portfolio managers. For a long while, though, Buffett offered an even better and equally cheap alternative to simply tracking the biggest stocks. Back in 1990, for example, the annual total return on Berkshire Hathaway common shares for the previous decade was 32 percent, or an astounding 18 percentage points higher than the S&P; 500 Index. By 2016, the annual gap had shrunk to just 1.3 percentage points, according to a recent Breakingviews analysis. In the latest quarter Berkshire, the company Buffett has run for some half a century, lost money in part because of the cornerstone business of insurance underwriting. At the same time, some of its biggest holdings are in companies that have longer-term question marks that could make it harder for the $400 billion conglomerate to outperform the broader index consistently. Wells Fargo, for one, is still working through its disastrous fake-accounts scandal. Investors just lodged a large protest vote against the board and Buffett on Saturday criticized the bank for how the affair was handled. He also revealed right before his gathering that he had dumped a third of his stake in IBM, whose value has fallen by about a fifth since Buffett first invested in 2011. Kraft Heinz, the U.S. food juggernaut in which Berkshire is a big owner, said last week that sales declined amid changing consumer habits. And even as Buffett swigged Coca-Cola on stage, the company’s sales have been falling with concerns growing about sugary drinks. Meanwhile, Buffett concedes that he “blew it” by not investing in Google and was “too dumb” to realize what Jeff Bezos was building at Amazon. Sitting out the new breed of American icons has been costly. As his returns converge with the S&P; 500 Index, Berkshire begins to look like another low-cost steady choice compared to otherwise woeful actively managed funds. Even Bogle might approve.",5072017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-buffett-breakingviews/buffetts-praise-of-jack-bogle-sounds-self-serving-idUSKBN1830SF
298,BRKa,Buffett calls Obamacare replacement 'a huge tax cut for guys like me',"(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc Chairman Warren Buffett on Saturday fumed that healthcare costs are eating away at the U.S. economy like “tapeworm” and said the Republican approach to overhaul Obamacare is a tax cut for the rich. The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday narrowly approved a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, a victory for Republican President Donald Trump who has called the 2010 law a “disaster.” Speaking at Berkshire’s annual shareholders’ meeting in Omaha, Buffett said his federal income taxes last year would have gone down 17 percent had the new law been in effect. “So it is a huge tax cut for guys like me,” he said. “And when there’s a tax cut, either the deficit goes up or they get the taxes from somebody else.” The Republican bill would repeal most of the taxes that paid for the law formally known as the Affordable Care Act. The party’s leadership has promised that the new American Health Care Act, which faces a likely overhaul and uncertain passage in the Senate, would address growing healthcare costs. Buffett said rising healthcare costs are crippling the competitiveness of U.S. companies abroad. Unlike in many other countries where much of healthcare spending is publicly financed, employers provide health insurance coverage for nearly half of Americans and often face sky-rocketing rates. Buffett said healthcare costs have risen much faster in the United States than in the rest of the world and “will go up a lot more.” “Medical costs are the tapeworm of American economic competitiveness,” he said. “That is a problem this society is having trouble with and is going to have more trouble with.” Buffett is a Democrat who vocally supported Hillary Clinton’s unsuccessful bid for the presidency against Trump. The fourth richest man in the world with a net worth totaling $74.3 billion, according to Forbes magazine, Buffett has vowed to donate nearly his entire fortune to charity. Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger added that he thinks neither political party “can think rationally” about healthcare because they “hate each other so much.”",5082017,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-buffett-healthcare/buffett-calls-obamacare-replacement-a-huge-tax-cut-for-guys-like-me-idUSL1N1IA1KQ
299,BRKa,Buffett says deal partner 3G follows 'standard capitalist formula'-CNBC,"May 8 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett said on Monday 3G Capital, its controversial partner on multiple transactions, follows a “standard capitalist formula” when it sweeps away thousands of jobs and imposes deep expense cuts to make the companies it buys more efficient. Speaking on CNBC television, Buffett said, “It’s a defect of mine” that he doesn’t focus as closely on the efficiency of business units at Berkshire Hathaway Inc, the conglomerate he has run since 1965. Berkshire and 3G control Kraft Heinz Co and recently tried to merge it with Unilever NV UNc.AS> for $143 billion, but was rebuffed. The Brazilian firm is known for “zero-based budgeting,” where it requires managers to periodically defend all of their expenses, and cuts waste where possible. “They have followed the standard capitalist formula ... of trying to do the same business with fewer people,” Buffett said. “People live better when there is more output per capita.” Nonetheless, he acknowledged that cutting jobs can be a “painful process.” Separately, Buffett expressed regret over his failure to invest early in Internet search company Google, now part of Alphabet Inc, saying “I should have some insight into” what became an “extraordinary business” with attributes of a monopoly. He said he was more comfortable buying shares of Apple Inc , in which Berkshire has disclosed a 133 million share stake, worth close to $20 billion on Friday. Buffett noted that many iPhone purchasers are repeat customers who know a new phone will be introduced regularly, or buy them for such occasions as graduations. “I can very easily determine the competitive position of Apple now and who is trying to chase them,” he said. He said “the shares, when we bought them, were much more reasonable” in price. Asked if he had stopped buying Apple, Buffett said: “Maybe, may not.” Buffett said he was not bothered by initial U.S. data showing the economy grew at just 0.7 percent in the first quarter, saying it was “more or less” growing at 2 percent a year. He said some of Berkshire’s industrial units saw upticks in business this year, as have credit card companies such as Visa Inc and American Express Co, a longtime Berkshire investment. “Credit cards will tell you a lot about the consumer, what their attitude is,” he said.

300,BRKa,Buffett's fledgling biBERK pursues online insurance 'experiment',"OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - It has been decades since anyone thought of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, or even its insurance operations, as “very, very small.” But that’s how a senior executive describes biBERK, a unit that lets owners of small businesses shop online for commercial vehicle, general liability, property, workers’ compensation and eventually professional liability insurance. The biBERK chief operating officer, Rakesh Gupta, said the year-old operation, known as “Cover Your Business” until a March name change that could benefit from Berkshire’s cachet, was the brainchild of Ajit Jain, Berkshire’s top insurance executive. Jain wanted a hassle-free way for small business owners to bypass insurance agents, often getting quotes within five minutes after completing short questionnaires. “Amazon.com can deliver something to you in four hours,” Gupta, who grew up in New Delhi and specialized in “big data” before joining biBERK, said in a recent interview. “If people can buy paper towels on the internet, why not insurance?” Sales data are confidential, but Gupta said biBERK, or Business Insurance Berkshire Hathaway, is signing up twice as many customers as a year ago. The business reflects none of Omaha-based Berkshire’s appetite for assuming huge insurance risks, such as major catastrophes or American International Group property and casualty claims, in exchange for upfront payments Buffett can invest. Gupta said business insurance could follow the trajectory of auto insurance, where Berkshire’s Geico unit, as well as rivals Progressive and USAA, won market share from State Farm and Allstate by driving underwriting costs, and premiums, down. “If that happens, we want to be at the forefront,” he said. In workers’ compensation, biBERK typically provides instant quotes to 60 percent of applicants, denies 20 percent, and asks 20 percent to speak with representatives. Improvements to the sign-up process now permit 50 percent of customers to buy without human help, up from 10 percent a year ago. Gupta said biBERK sometimes holds what it calls “hatchet” meetings to assess risks and red flags the questionnaires might not address. Still, biBERK can afford the occasional mistake. Its parent Berkshire Hathaway Direct Insurance Co has $118 million of surplus capital, plus reinsurance support from Berkshire’s National Indemnity Co unit. Gupta said insurers have been slow to adopt online technology in part because of state regulatory burdens. He hopes biBERK will attract more younger, more technology-savvy people going into business for themselves. “It’s still very, very small,” he said. “In the scheme of Berkshire, it’s an interesting experiment.”",5092017,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-biberk/buffetts-fledgling-biberk-pursues-online-insurance-experiment-idUSL1N1IB1RH

In a regulatory filing, Berkshire said that in the first quarter its American stake grew 8 percent to 49.3 million shares worth $2.08 billion, while its Southwest stake grew 10 percent to 47.7 million shares worth $2.57 billion. Berkshire also shed 8 percent of its holdings in Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), ending March with 55 million shares worth $2.53 billion. Buffett became one of the largest investors in American, Delta, Southwest and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) last year, reversing his disdain for an industry he once called a “death trap” for investors. He told shareholders at Berkshire’s annual meeting on May 6 that airlines’ business model had improved, with fewer unsold seats and an ability to charge for checked bags, seat choices and other amenities that were once free. Berkshire’s sale of its $251 million Fox stake came several months after the parent of Fox News became embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal, but before news surfaced that the network and top-rated host Bill O’Reilly paid about $13 million to settle harassment claims by five women. O’Reilly left Fox last month. It is unclear why Berkshire sold Fox or who made the investment, which began in 2014. Smaller equity investments at Berkshire are normally made by Buffett’s deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who together recently invested about $21 billion. Buffett’s assistant did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Berkshire’s stock holdings are closely scrutinized by investors hoping to learn what has won or lost Buffett’s favor.

308,BRKa,"Berkshire Hathaway adds to American, Southwest Airlines bets; sheds Fox","NEW YORK, May 15 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Monday said it added to its sizable investments in American Airlines Group Inc and Southwest Airlines Co, and shed its stake in Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. In a regulatory filing, Berkshire said that in the first quarter it boosted its stake in American by 8 percent to 49.3 million shares worth $2.08 billion as of March 31, and in Southwest by 10 percent to 47.7 million shares worth $2.57 billion. It also shed 8 percent of its holdings in Delta Air Lines Inc, ending the quarter with 55 million shares worth $2.53 billion. Berkshire became one of the largest investors in American, Delta, Southwest and United Continental Holdings Inc last year, after Buffett concluded that the industry had become more efficient, with fewer unsold seats and an ability to charge for checked bags and other amenities that were once free. The sale of the Fox stake, which totaled $251 million at year end, was completed long after the parent of Fox News became embroiled in a sexual misconduct scandal, but before its top-rated host Bill O’Reilly left the network. It is unclear who made the Fox investment for Berkshire. Smaller equity investments at Berkshire are normally made by Buffett’s deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who together recently invested about $21 billion.

311,BRKa,Ukrainian hacker gets prison in U.S. insider trading case,"(Reuters) - A Ukrainian computer hacker was sentenced on Monday to 2-1/2 years in prison over his role in a global scheme to conduct insider trading based on stolen, yet-to-be-published corporate news releases, U.S. prosecutors said. Vadym Iermolovych, 29, of Kiev, had been the first hacker to admit criminal wrongdoing, in what authorities have called the largest known hacking scheme to game financial markets, leading to more than $100 million of legal profit. Iermolovych was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Madeline Cox Arleo in Newark, New Jersey, one year after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit computer hacking, and aggravated identity theft. The defendant’s lawyer was not immediately available for comment. Authorities said the illegal scheme involved the theft of 150,000 news releases from Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire between February 2010 and August 2015. Traders, including many with Russian ties, would give hackers “shopping lists” of releases they wanted, and traded in companies such as Caterpillar Inc, Home Depot Co and Panera Bread Co, authorities said. Ten defendants, including three hackers and seven traders, have been criminally charged in New Jersey and Brooklyn, New York, and five have pleaded guilty. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission brought related civil charges against more than 40 defendants.

313,BRKa,"UPDATE 1-A.M. Best affirms AIG ratings after review, insurer's stock rises","(Reuters) - A.M. Best Co affirmed its financial strength rating on American International Group Inc on Tuesday, lifting some uncertainty over the New York-based insurer’s ability to meet its long-term debt obligations, which had unsettled some investors.  AIG’s stock ticked up after A.M. Best issued its rating, ending the day up 1.3 percent. The largest U.S. underwriter of commercial property and casualty insurance has been through a turbulent few months.  In January, it announced a deal to pay $10.2 billion to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc  to take on many of its long-term commercial insurance policies, as the losses it expects to pay out on them continues to grow.  In February, AIG made a $5.6 billion addition to its reserves to cover future commercial insurance claims on policies it had already written, which led the company to report an unexpectedly large fourth quarter loss, jolting investors and AIG’s board.  In March, Chief Executive Peter Hancock, who had been under pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn since 2015, announced his resignation, even though he was only part-way through his plan to turn around the insurer’s fortunes. Earlier this month AIG named Brian Duperreault as its new CEO.  A.M. Best launched its review after AIG announced the Berkshire deal, and it has cast a shadow of the insurer for the past four months.  “We view this announcement as a positive step in AIG’s plans to improve its franchise,” wrote Barclays analyst Jay Gelb in a research note on Tuesday. A.M. Best’s outlook for the ratings assigned to AIG is now “stable,” the specialist insurance rating firm said on Tuesday. It also affirmed ratings for AIG’s subsidiaries. AIG’s ability to meet its long-term financial obligations is “good,” on A.M. Best’s scale, which ranges from “exceptional” to “poor.”  AIG’s appointment of the Bermuda-born Duperreault, who spent many years at the insurer earlier in his career, was a factor in the rating decision, said A.M. Best analyst Darian Ryan.  Duperreault was a protégé of long-time AIG leader Maurice “Hank” Greenberg and he went on to found and run Bermuda-based Hamilton Insurance Group Ltd. [L4N1IH41F] “From this review, it has been possible to make a satisfactory assessment that AIG’s consolidated risk-adjusted capitalization remains supportive of the ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries,” Ryan wrote.

314,BRKa,Warren Buffett takes 3 percent stake in Germany's Lanxess,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Lanxess (LXSG.DE) disclosed on Monday that Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), the conglomerate run by billionaire Warren Buffett, had acquired a 3 percent stake in the German chemicals maker. Lanxess shares jumped 2.9 percent to 65.06 euros by 0936 GMT after the news, even though the stock was trading without the rights to a 0.70 euro-per-share dividend for the first time. In a regulatory filing, Lanxess said that Berkshire Hathaway’s General Reinsurance subsidiary took a stake that reached just over 3 percent on May 19. The shares held by General Re - whose total financial investments excluding cash holdings stood at about $22 billion at the end of last year - were worth about 180 million euros ($200 million) at that time. General Re’s stake in Lanxess crossed the 3 percent threshold after Lanxess on May 11 beat consensus estimates for first-quarter earnings on strong sales of engineering plastics and synthetic rubber, but the company warned at the time that demand would soften later this year. [nL8N1ID0XS] Shares in Lanxess, a former unit of Bayer (BAYGn.DE) whose products include pesticide ingredients, construction pigments and leather chemicals, earlier this month reached four-year highs. Lanxess has said that after recent acquisitions worth a combined 2.6 billion euros more strategic steps could be in the offing in the second half of the year.

315,BRKa,"UPDATE 3-GM investors reject Greenlight share plan, board slate","(Adds Greenlight response, quote, background) By Nick Carey and Michael Flaherty DETROIT/NEW YORK, June 6 (Reuters) - General Motors Co shareholders on Tuesday overwhelmingly rejected proposals by hedge fund Greenlight Capital to restructure the company’s stock and reshape its board, backing Chief Executive Mary Barra’s efforts to rev up the company’s stalled share price. Fending off the challenge from Greenlight founder David Einhorn does not mean the end of Barra’s battles. GM shares traded on Tuesday at $34.25, about 16 percent lower than when Barra became CEO, despite robust profits and a series of moves to sell or shut down money losing operations. The win also does not mean pressure will let up from Greenlight, which is the fifth largest shareholder, and while gracious in defeat, continued to make the case for fresh faces on the board. “We are disappointed that shareholders have elected to maintain the status quo,” Einhorn said in a statement on Tuesday. “We congratulate GM’s management on their win today.” Greenlight’s campaign came as U.S. auto industry sales of new vehicles have begun to wane after a boom cycle that has lasted since 2010. Silicon Valley electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc this year surpassed GM’s market value, reflecting investor confidence that, despite heavy losses, Tesla has a better strategy as the auto industry shifts to ride services and electric, autonomous vehicles. In comments before Tuesday’s shareholder meeting, Barra acknowledged Greenlight’s position on its stock price, saying “we do believe GM stock is undervalued,” and said the company “is continually looking at ideas” to increase investor interest. Preliminary results showed more than 91 percent of shareholders voted against Greenlight’s proposal to have GM offer dividend and capital appreciation shares, according to GM officials at the meeting. GM’s board nominees were elected with between 84 percent and 99 percent of the vote, the company said. The board will remain the same at 11 members, with Barra as chairman. Einhorn floated the dual-class proposal in March, saying it could boost the automaker’s $52-billion market capitalization by as much as $38 billion. Greenlight, which owns a 3.6 percent stake in GM, later nominated three directors for the company’s board: Leo Hindery, who served as CEO for five telecommunications and media companies, including AT&T; Broadband and Liberty Media; Vinit Sethi, Greenlight’s director of research and William Thorndike, founder Housatonic Partners and the chairman of Consol Energy. Greenlight hoped to replace three incumbent directors: Jane Mendillo, Michael Mullen and Carol Stephenson. But Einhorn’s pitch flopped with debt rating agencies and proxy advisers and he failed to rally other shareholders to his cause. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, which holds a 3.3 percent stake in GM, remained silent on the proposal. Einhorn added in Tuesday’s statement that GM should still consider Hindery and Thorndike for the board. Greenlight is a multi-strategy hedge fund that has taken on other corporate giants such as Apple Inc, but whose last activist proxy contest was more than 10 years ago. Jason Schloetzer, professor at Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business, said Greenlight’s loss is not a major blow to the roughly $10 billion hedge fund and time will tell if its stake earns the kind of returns Einhorn hopes to reap. “While Greenlight would have liked to have increased their influence over GM’s financial management, it’s unfair to conclude from today’s vote that the fund will not be successful in its investment over the medium term,” Schloetzer said.

316,BRKa,Berkshire units settle California 'bait and switch' insurance probe,"(Reuters) - Two insurance units of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc have agreed to lower their rates and provide more disclosures to settle claims that they overcharged small business owners in California for workers’ compensation coverage. The settlement announced by California’s Department of Insurance on Thursday resolves charges that Applied Underwriters Inc and California Insurance Co steered prospective customers to unapproved or unexpectedly costly policies, using “illegal side agreements” that exposed policyholders to greater risks. California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones had last June halted the Berkshire units’ sale of unapproved “EquityComp” policies after finding that one policy subjected Shasta Linen Supply Inc, a Sacramento employer of 63 people, to hundreds of thousands of dollars of extra costs. Vermont and Wisconsin regulators enacted bans of similar products in those states. Thursday’s settlement allows the resumption of EquityComp sales in California, provided that companies can absorb their risks, Jones said in a statement. “This is a significant victory in protecting California businesses from sophisticated bait and switch marketing tactics,” Jones said. “We have gone to the limit of our authority over workers’ compensation insurance products in winning concessions that eliminate oppressive contract terms.” Jeff Silver, general counsel of Applied Underwriters, said in a statement the accord provides “certainty” that EquityComp is “fit for the marketplace. We are pleased to now resume selling this product in California.” Workers’ compensation insurance typically covers lost wages and medical costs for employees injured on the job. The case put a spotlight on lesser-known parts of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire’s insurance operations, which also include the Geico car insurer, the General Re reinsurer and a business that protects against large and unusual risks.

320,BRKa,Warren Buffett charity lunch sells for $2.68 million,"(Reuters) - An anonymous fan of Warren Buffett agreed to pay $2,679,001 at an online charity auction to have lunch with the billionaire chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. The winning bid came in the closing seconds of the five-day eBay auction, which drew 41 bids before ending on Friday night. It was lower than the record $3,456,789 bid in similar auctions in 2012 and 2016. Money will go to Glide, a San Francisco charity that provides food, health care and other services to the homeless, the impoverished, and people struggling with substance abuse. The successful bidder and up to seven friends will dine with Buffett at the Smith & Wollensky steak house in Manhattan. All topics are fair game apart from where Buffett will invest next. Buffett has held 18 annual auctions for Glide, raising about $26.3 million. He became involved with Glide after his first wife, Susan, became a volunteer, prior to her death in 2004. “We are very delighted and proud that Mr. Buffett has for years made sure that he participates,” the Rev. Cecil Williams, 87, co-founder of Glide and pastor since 1963 of the Glide Memorial United Methodist Church, said after the auction ended. Contributions have a “tremendous impact” on people who find themselves “really unable to come to grips with the issue of poverty in urban America,” Williams said. Glide uses its $18 million annual budget to provide more than 750,000 free meals, emergency shelter for 8,500 people, 2,600 HIV and Hepatitis C tests, and day care and after school programs for nearly 450 children. Buffett, 86, is the world’s fourth-richest person, worth $76.2 billion according to Forbes magazine. He is donating virtually all of his fortune to charity. Past auction winners have included hedge fund manager Ted Weschler, who paid a combined $5.25 million to win two auctions. He later became one of Buffett’s investing deputies, and along with fellow deputy Todd Combs is likely to oversee Berkshire’s stock investments after Buffett departs. Berkshire has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, energy, industrial, railroad, retail and other sectors. Buffett owns about 18 percent of the $419 billion company. The lunches that fetched $3,456,789 remain the most expensive items sold on eBay where all proceeds went to charity. Bidding moved online in 2003. According to Glide, these bidders have won its auctions: 2000: Pete Budlong, $25,000 2001: Jim Halperin and Scott Tilson, $20,000 2002: Jim Halperin and Scott Tilson, $25,000 2003: David Einhorn, Greenlight Capital, $250,100 2004: Jason Choo, Singapore, $202,100 2005: Anonymous, $351,100 2006: Yongping Duan, California, $620,100 2007: Mohnish Pabrai, Guy Spier, Harina Kapoor, $650,100 2008: Zhao Danyang, Pure Heart Asset Management, China, $2,110,100 2009: Courtenay Wolfe, Salida Capital, Canada, $1,680,300 2010: Ted Weschler, $2,626,311 2011: Ted Weschler, $2,626,411 2012: Anonymous, $3,456,789 2013: Anonymous, $1,000,100 2014: Andy Chua, Singapore, $2,166,766 2015: Zhu Ye, Dalian Zeus Entertainment Co, China, $2,345,678 2016: Anonymous, $3,456,789 2017: Anonymous, $2,679,001 ",6102017,http://www.reuters.com/article/buffett-lunch/warren-buffett-charity-lunch-sells-for-2-68-million-idUSL1N1J513H
321,BRKa,ANALYSIS-Tech rout sparks search for value,"NEW YORK, June 12 (Reuters) - The “sell in May” memo arrived a bit late in some investors’ inboxes this year. A technology sector rout extended to its second trading day on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite on track for its biggest two-day loss since September. The tech selling dragged down all three major indexes, causing concerns of wider bearishness in equities. “We’re having a hard time deciding whether it’s really a tech-specific sell-off or if this is a valuation pullback, so we’re just holding pat right now,” said Scott Goginsky, a co-portfolio manager of the Biondo Growth Fund. However, investors took comfort that rather than totally abandoning equities, some were rotating into value sectors of the market. Losses were contained by a continuing rebound in energy and bank stocks. “The overall equity market health is reasonably good because people are rotating - they are not frantically getting out of stocks,” said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co. Up nearly 14 percent since President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, the technology sector of the S&P; 500 had ballooned to its most expensive since early 2008 in terms of price to earnings expectations. Tech took over the market leadership from financials and other sectors that outperformed after the Nov. 8 presidential election on hopes that Trump’s agenda of deregulation and tax cuts would benefit the sector. The five largest U.S. companies by market capitalization, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook added more than $600 billion in market cap in 2017 before the sell-off started, making some analysts wary of sector over-extension. The Technology Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund was down 1.1 percent Monday after having fallen as much as 2.2 percent - on track to post its largest two-day percentage decline in nearly a year. The decline was led by Apple, stung by a broker downgrade for a second straight week on Monday. The tech sell-off “is a reminder that markets that have full valuations are prone to quick reversals,” said Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co, which oversees more than $1.5 trillion in assets. The recent reversal in technology has given new life to the “value trade,” in which investors bet on large, undervalued companies and seek dividend payments. The iShares S&P; 500 value ETF is up more than 4 percent over the last two sessions. The fund’s top holdings include Exxon Mobil, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan. At the same time, the technology rout has left some investors finding opportunities to add to their tech holdings at lower prices. “We’re not worried at all about tech. We just think it’s a correction and a dip,” said Louis Navellier, chairman and founder of Navellier & Associates , in Reno, Nevada. “Guys like me are net buyers right now… It’ll be fine.” ",6122017,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-tech/analysis-tech-rout-sparks-search-for-value-idUSL1N1J90VR

323,BRKa,Tech rout sparks search for value,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The “sell in May” memo arrived a bit late in some investors’ inboxes this year. A technology sector rout extended to its second trading day on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite on track for its biggest two-day loss since September. The tech selling dragged down all three major indexes, causing concerns of wider bearishness in equities.  “We’re having a hard time deciding whether it’s really a tech-specific sell-off or if this is a valuation pullback, so we’re just holding pat right now,” said Scott Goginsky, a co-portfolio manager of the Biondo Growth Fund.  However, investors took comfort that rather than totally abandoning equities, some were rotating into value sectors of the market. Losses were contained by a continuing rebound in energy and bank stocks.  “The overall equity market health is reasonably good because people are rotating - they are not frantically getting out of stocks,” said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co.  Up nearly 14 percent since President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, the technology sector of the S&P; 500 .SPLRCT had ballooned to its most expensive since early 2008 in terms of price to earnings expectations. Tech took over the market leadership from financials and other sectors that outperformed after the Nov. 8 presidential election on hopes that Trump’s agenda of deregulation and tax cuts would benefit the sector. The five largest U.S. companies by market capitalization, Apple (AAPL.O), Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Facebook (FB.O) added more than $600 billion in market cap in 2017 before the sell-off started, making some analysts wary of sector over-extension. The Technology Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund (XLK.P) was down 0.8 percent Monday after having fallen as much as 2.2 percent - on track to post its largest two-day percentage decline in nearly a year. The decline was led by Apple, stung by a broker downgrade for a second straight week on Monday.  Short sellers had already been building their position in Apple since the end of May, according to financial data firm S3, with short interest topping $9 billion for the first time since May of last year. Apple is now the third-largest worldwide short, behind Alibaba Group (BABA.N), with $16.7 billion of short interest, and Tesla Inc(TSLA.O), with $10.5 billion. The tech sell-off “is a reminder that markets that have full valuations are prone to quick reversals,” said Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co, which oversees more than $1.5 trillion in assets.

324,BRKa,Home Capital to get C$2 billion loan from Berkshire Hathaway,"(Reuters) - Home Capital Group Inc said billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc will provide a new C$2 billion ($1.50 billion) line of credit to its unit Home Trust Co, ending the Canadian lender’s strategic review process. Berkshire will also indirectly buy C$400 million of Home Capital’s common shares in a private placement through its unit Columbia Insurance Co, Home Capital said on Wednesday. “Home Capital’s strong assets, its ability to originate and underwrite well-performing mortgages, and its leading position in a growing market sector make this a very attractive investment,” said Warren Buffett, Berkshire chairman and CEO.Berkshire will hold an about 38.39 percent equity stake in Home Capital after buying 40 million shares at an average price of about C$10.00 per common share. Berkshire will make an initial investment of C$153.2 million to buy 16 million common shares and an additional investment of C$246.8 million to purchase 24 million shares through a private placement.  The additional investment is subject to shareholder approval, while the initial investment will not require approval from shareholders. Canada’s biggest non-bank lender also said it will continue to explore further asset sales and financing deals over the next year, but has concluded its strategic review process that began in April. “This investment from Berkshire not only addresses Home Capital’s near-term requirements for additional liquidity and a lower-cost credit agreement, but also facilitates what the Board feels is the best available path to long-term success,” Home Capital’s Chair Brenda Eprile said. Berkshire will not be granted any rights to nominate directors to Home Capital board or any governance rights as an equity holder, Home Capital said. The C$2 billion loan facility, expected to be effective on June 29, will replace the existing one for a similar amount between Home Trust Company and a major institutional investor. On Tuesday, the company said it would sell a portfolio of commercial mortgage assets valued at C$1.2 billion to bolster its liquidity and trim outstanding debt on a C$2 billion emergency facility it agreed with the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan in April.  Last week, Home Capital reached a C$30.5 million settlement with the Ontario Securities Commission, settled a class action lawsuit and accepted responsibility for misleading investors about problems with its mortgage underwriting procedures. The settlement is expected to help secure long-term financing at sustainable interest rates, investors and analysts said.

325,BRKa,American Airlines pushes back on Qatar Airways plan to buy stake,"(Reuters) - American Airlines’ chief executive said on Thursday he is not “particularly excited” about Qatar Airways’ interest in buying up to 10 percent of the U.S. carrier’s shares, in a letter to employees following the state-owned Gulf airline’s overture.  The move by Qatar Airways would expand its investments in North America as Qatar is embroiled in the region’s worst diplomatic crisis in years and is locked in an airspace rights row with three other Gulf states.   Separately, American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) is already part of a push by U.S. carriers to squeeze Qatar out of their domestic market.  Along with United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) and Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), American has pressed the U.S. government to curb U.S. flights by Qatar Airways and rival Gulf carriers Emirates [EMIRA.UL] and Etihad Airways.  The U.S. carriers charge that their Gulf rivals have received billions of dollars in unfair state subsidies, allegations the Gulf carriers deny. In his letter, American CEO Doug Parker promised to continue American’s “full court press ... to stand up to companies that are illegally subsidized by their governments.”  He also said he found Qatar Airways’ proposed investment “puzzling given our extremely public stance on the illegal subsidies that Qatar, Emirates and Etihad have all received over the years from their governments.” Qatar Airways responded on Twitter, saying: “We are glad to see American Airlines’ CEO Doug Parker’s perspective that he agrees with Qatar Airways’ belief that American Airlines is a solid financial investment.” The potential investment is worth at least $808 million, American said in a regulatory filing on Thursday, and would put Qatar Airways’ stake on par with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), which holds a 10 percent stake in the airline. Shares of American Airlines rose more than 5 percent in pre-market trade after it disclosed the potential investment. The stock closed up 1.1 percent. Qatar Airways said in a statement that it sees a “strong investment opportunity” in American and that it “intends to build a passive position in the company with no involvement in management, operations or governance.” “Qatar Airways plans to make an initial investment of up to 4.75 percent. Qatar Airways will not exceed 4.75 percent without prior consent of the American Airlines board. Qatar Airways will make all necessary regulatory filings at the appropriate time,” it said.  American, in its filing, noted potential obstacles to Qatar’s plan, as its rules prohibit “anyone from acquiring 4.75 percent or more of the company’s outstanding stock without advance approval from the board.” It said it had received no request from Qatar for such approval. Further, American said, “there are foreign ownership laws that limit the total percentage of foreign voting interest to 24.9 percent.” A stake in American Airlines would add to Qatar Airways’ investment portfolio. The Middle East’s second biggest airline also owns 20 percent of British Airways-owner International Airlines Group (ICAG.L) and 10 percent of South America’s LATAM. American Airlines shares are cheaper than Delta, United and JetBlue (JBLU.O) on a forward 12-month earnings per share basis, according to Thomson Reuters data, and are the cheapest among the top eight U.S. airlines.  Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker has said the investments were purely financial, though he has looked for opportunities to cut costs or expand service with the oneworld alliance airlines in which it owns a stake. Qatar Airways, American Airlines, IAG’s British Airways, Iberia and LATAM are all members of the oneworld airline alliance. British Airways and Qatar Airways have a revenue-sharing partnership between their respective hubs in Doha and London, and Qatar Airways plans to launch flights to LATAM’s base in Santiago, Chile.  “The U.S. market is strategically important to Qatar Airways and this would strengthen their ability to feed at the U.S. end,” independent aviation consultant John Strickland told Reuters. “However, if it does go ahead it would not give them automatic antitrust immunity. That would have to be negotiated separately.”   Qatar Airways’ desire to invest in American could be as much a political decision as financial, analysts said, as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have closed their airspace to Qatar Airways, forcing it to cut flights to those countries and fly longer, more expensive, routes. Those countries cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar earlier this month, accusing it of fomenting regional unrest, supporting terrorism and getting too close to Iran, all of which Doha denies. “There’s a good chance this investment plan by Qatar Airways may have more to do with demonstrating sovereign Qatar’s continued commitment to the United States amid the latest Gulf States feud with Qatar,” Gimme Credit analyst Vicki Bryan wrote in a research note.  Al-Baker, highly critical of the blocking of airspace, has said Qatar Airways would use the aircraft used to fly to those countries for fast-track expansion plans elsewhere.

327,BRKa,Short seller Cohodes keeps Home Capital bet despite Buffett deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Short seller Marc Cohodes, who has bet against Home Capital Group Inc shares for more than two years, said on Thursday he is keeping his short position on the Canadian lender despite a capital infusion from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. “This was clearly the best deal they had,” Cohodes said in a telephone interview. “If it wasn’t Warren Buffett’s name, the stock would be way, way, way down today.”  Home Capital shares soared as much as 18 percent to its highest since April after Berkshire Hathaway agreed to provide a new C$2 billion loan facility.

329,BRKa,Home Capital shares surge after funding deal with Berkshire Hathaway,"(Recasts, adds shares, terms of new loan) By Matt Scuffham TORONTO, June 22 (Reuters) - Canadian lender Home Capital Group Inc’s shares soared as much as 18 percent to its highest since April on Thursday after billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc agreed to provide a new C$2 billion loan facility. Berkshire Hathaway will also take a 38.4 percent stake in the company after buying $400 million worth of Home Capital stock. Home Capital had sought new funding to replace a costly emergency credit line it received on April 26 from the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP) after depositors rushed to withdraw funds from its high-interest savings accounts. Depositors have pulled 95 percent of funds from Home Capital’s high-interest savings accounts since March 27, when the company terminated the employment of former Chief Executive Officer Martin Reid. The withdrawals accelerated after April 19, when Canada’s biggest securities regulator, the Ontario Securities Commission, accused Home Capital of making misleading statements to investors about its mortgage underwriting business. Home Capital last week reached a settlement with the commission and accepted responsibility for misleading investors about mortgage underwriting problems. The HOOPP funding came with an effective interest rate of 22.5 percent on the first C$1 billion drawn down, including a non-refundable commitment fee. The new credit agreement with Berkshire comes with an interest rate of 9 percent, with a standby fee on funds not drawn down of 1.75 percent, compared with 2.5 percent previously. It has no additional fees attached. Berkshire will buy C$400 million in new Home Capital shares, issued at C$9.55 per share, a 15 percent discount to the average share price prior to Berkshire Hathaway’s final proposal on June 13 and a 33 percent discount to Wednesday’s closing price. Home Capital Director Alan Hibben said the lender had interest from over 70 parties prior to the investment from Berkshire Hathaway. “We had over 70 people under NDA (non-disclosure agreement) within the data (room). They were not just Canadians, there were global players involved with that,” Hibben told analysts on a conference call. “Other proposals that we received were not as attractive to us with respect to the cost of the backstop,” he added. The stock rose as high as $18.94 before easing to $16.65, up 11.4 percent.

333,BRKa,Berkshire bulks up in real estate with Store Capital stake,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc has taken a nearly 10 percent stake in the real estate investment trust Store Capital Corp, adding to bets in the sector by the conglomerate controlled by billionaire Warren Buffett. Store, which invests in single tenant properties, said Berkshire’s National Indemnity Co unit spent $377.1 million on 18.62 million shares at $20.25 each, giving it a 9.8 percent stake. The stake was announced four days after Berkshire said it would invest up to C$400 million for a 38.4 percent equity stake in struggling Canadian lender Home Capital Corp and provide a C$2 billion credit line. Shares of Store were up $2.20, or 10.6 percent, at $22.97 in afternoon trading, likely reflecting Buffett’s imprimatur. Christopher Volk, Store’s chief executive, in an interview said the Berkshire investment was three years in the making, beginning with his 2014 email to Buffett, when the REIT was still private, to gauge his interest. He said Buffett responded within three hours, and put him in touch with a deputy, Ted Weschler. “Over the years, they followed every earnings release, every conference call, every presentation, every investor supplement, and became very familiar with the company and our investment strategy,” Volk said. “Then about 10 days ago, I got a call from Ted Weschler, and he said he would like to make an investment,” Volk added. “I was not expecting his call.” Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The investment makes it Store’s third-largest investor, after Vanguard Group and Fidelity Management & Research. Store’s portfolio includes more than 1,750 properties in 48 U.S. states, including such customers as AMC Entertainment and the second-largest Applebee’s restaurant franchisee. Berkshire’s other investments tied to real estate include HomeServices of America, the second-largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage, and Clayton Homes, which makes manufactured housing. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate has more than 90  other business units.     Store shares had fallen as much as 27 percent after November’s U.S. presidential election, a decline Volk attributed to worries about rising interest rates and the retail sector. But he said Store generates most revenue from the service and manufacturing sectors, and just 18 percent from retail. “The quality of the contracts we create is incredible, and the spreads between lease rates and the costs of our borrowings is our highest in memory,” Volk said. Store plans to use proceeds from the offering to buy properties, repay debt and other purposes.

Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The investment makes it Store’s third-largest investor, after Vanguard Group and Fidelity. Store is a Scottsdale, Arizona-based real estate investment trust whose portfolio includes more than 1,750 properties in 48 U.S. states. Its specialties include sale-leaseback transactions, where owners sell properties and lease them back, freeing up sale proceeds to invest elsewhere. Store plans to use proceeds from the offering to buy properties, repay debt and other purposes. Berkshire’s other investments tied to real estate include HomeServices of America, the second-largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage, and Clayton Homes, which makes manufactured housing. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate has more than 90 units in the insurance, energy, railroad, retail and other sectors.

336,BRKa,Buffett's Berkshire on verge of becoming BofA's top shareholder,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) may be on the verge of becoming Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) largest shareholder, after the bank raised its dividend in the wake of a positive assessment of its ability to handle market stresses. Bank of America on Wednesday boosted its annual dividend 60 percent to 48 cents per share from 30 cents, beginning in the third quarter. Buffett has said a boost of that size would likely prompt him to swap Berkshire’s preferred shares in the second-largest bank into common shares now worth about $16.7 billion. Berkshire did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An exchange would made Berkshire the largest shareholder of both Bank of America and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the third-largest U.S. bank, and more than triple a $5 billion investment made fewer than six years ago. It would also signal Buffett’s confidence in Brian Moynihan, Bank of America’s chief executive. Moynihan has worked to restore investors’ confidence in his Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank after it spent more than $70 billion since the global financial crisis to resolve legal and regulatory matters, largely from its purchases of Countrywide Financial Corp and Merrill Lynch & Co. “Buffett has said he is very happy with what Moynihan’s doing, and it’s easy work for him to get more dividends,” said Bill Smead, whose $1.16 billion Smead Value fund includes shares of both companies. “For Bank of America, it would mean a further endorsement by the most spectacular large-cap stock picker of all time.” Buffett is worth $76.1 billion, Forbes magazine says. The dividend increase required approval by the Federal Reserve, which conducts annual “stress tests” of big banks’ ability to handle tough economic and market conditions. On Wednesday, the Fed approved capital plans for Bank of America, which also announced a $12 billion stock buyback plan, and 33 other large U.S. banks. Buffett had bought $5 billion of Bank of America preferred stock with a 6 percent dividend, or $300 million annually, in August 2011, when investors worried about the bank’s capital needs. The purchase included warrants to acquire 700 million common shares at $7.14 each, less than one-third Wednesday’s closing price of $23.88.  In his Feb. 25 letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett said he “would anticipate” swapping the preferred stock into common stock if the annual dividend rose above 44 cents per share. If Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire made the swap now, it would have a $11.7 billion paper profit and begin collecting $336 million of annual dividends, on top of roughly $1.7 billion of dividends already paid. A swap would also let Berkshire enjoy gains if Bank of America’s stock price rose. In contrast, the value of the preferred shares will not change so long as Bank of America does not collapse. Berkshire’s warrants expire in September 2021. Buffett’s bet was among more than $25 billion of high-yielding investments he made from 2008 to 2011 in such companies as General Electric Co (GE.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N). The investments shored up confidence in the companies and helped give Buffett a reputation as a lender of last resort when times were tough. Bank of America’s largest shareholder is Vanguard Group, whose 652.4 million shares give it a 6.6 percent stake, Reuters data show.

339,BRKa,U.S. housing stocks may rally as millennials age: Smead,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks of large U.S. home builders and building materials companies are poised to rise as millennials age and need housing, according to Bill Smead, the chief executive of Smead Capital Management. In an interview on Wednesday, Smead said value-oriented companies such as those involved with housing will regain favor once investors lose their infatuation with trendier, high-flying names that he called “The Jetsons.” The title of the animated TV show is his shorthand for Amazon.com Inc, electric car maker Tesla Inc, and technology companies such as Google parent Alphabet Inc that are often dominant, viewed as on the cusp of the next big thing, or led by charismatic leaders like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Tesla’s Elon Musk. “If tech goes back to being mortal, value is going to get hot,” Smead said. He said housing companies will benefit as a growing number of people get married later in life, and more millennials move into the 35-44 age bracket. “It will change from millennials dominating the economy as single people to dominating the economy as married people,” he said. Smead’s $1.16 billion Smead Value Fund is up 9.51 percent this year, outperforming 80 percent of its peers, and 15.90 percent annually over five years, outperforming 95 percent, according to Morningstar Inc. Turnover is minimal in the concentrated fund, which owned just 26 stocks on March 31, led by homebuilder NVR Inc. Smead’s other investments include homebuilder Lennar Corp, home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, which owns and invests in a variety of real estate businesses. While Smead’s Seattle-based firm invests in hometown companies Nordstrom Inc and Starbucks Corp, an exception is Amazon, which agreed this month to buy Whole Foods Markets Inc for $13.7 billion. Smead favors companies that meet economic needs. “Delivering your groceries to you, the jury is still out on that,” he said. “Does that meet a need?” Many people will continue to enjoy shopping in person, even if only because “humans need something to do,” he added. For that reason, he said, many brick-and-mortar retailers do not deserve the dinosaur reputation pinned on them after a series of recent bankruptcies in the sector.  He said even the net worth of Sears Holdings Corp, whose stock he does not own, could be far greater in bankruptcy than its roughly $8 stock price suggests. “The demise of physical locations of stores is way overblown,” he said.

343,BRKa,Buffett's company to become Bank of America's top shareholder,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s company will become the biggest shareholder in Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), after Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Friday invoked its right to acquire 700 million shares of the second-largest U.S. bank. Berkshire will take a roughly 7 percent ownership stake, worth about $17 billion based on Bank of America’s closing price of $24.32 on Thursday. The transaction will make Bank of America one of Berkshire’s largest equity investments, joining Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the nation’s third-largest bank. It was made possible by Bank of America’s June 28 decision to boost its quarterly dividend to 12 cents per share from 7.5 cents, after passing the Federal Reserve’s latest “stress test” of its capacity to weather difficult markets. Shares of Bank of America were up 16 cents at $24.48 in early trading on Friday. Berkshire will exercise warrants to acquire the 700 million common shares when Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America increases its dividend, expected in the third quarter. It will swap the $5 billion of Bank of America preferred shares it bought in August 2011 for the common stock, in a cash-free exchange. Berkshire is sitting on a roughly $12 billion paper profit, because Bank of America’s stock price is more than triple the $7.14 exercise price for the warrants. After the swap is completed, Buffett will begin collecting $336 million of annual dividends, more than the $300 million he gets from the preferred shares, which have a 6 percent dividend. Berkshire is also the largest shareholder in Wells Fargo, which sends Buffett close to $800 million of annual dividends. The billionaire investor’s Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns more than 90 businesses such as the Geico car insurer, Dairy Queen ice cream and BNSF railroad. Brian Moynihan, Bank of America’s chief executive, accepted Buffett’s investment when many investors worried whether the lender would have enough capital. The bank was only about midway through a multi-year process to clean up its balance sheet, litigation and regulatory probes, largely from its purchases of Countrywide Financial Corp and Merrill Lynch & Co. That process cost more than $70 billion. Buffett has often praised Moynihan’s leadership, telling CNBC in September 2015 that Moynihan resuscitated a bank that had been a “terrible mess.” Bank of America’s current largest shareholder is Vanguard Group, whose 652.4 million shares give it a 6.6 percent stake, Reuters data show.

349,BRKa,Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway nears deal for bankrupt Oncor -sources,"(Reuters) - The energy unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc is nearing a deal to acquire Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC, allowing the utility to exit a three-year bankruptcy, according to people familiar with the matter. The deal is a bold bet by Buffett that he can get the deal past Texas regulators after they blocked two earlier attempts to sell Oncor to other companies. It also represents a return to a previously soured investment for Buffet, who in 2013 lost $873 million on his bonds in Oncor’s parent, Energy Future Holdings. Berkshire Hathaway’s deal, which could be announced by Friday, would value Oncor at slightly less than Florida utility NextEra Energy Inc’s previous $18.4 billion bid, making it Buffett’s third biggest acquisition ever, two people said. The Wall Street Journal, which reported on the deal earlier, said the deal could be valued at more than $17.5 billion. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Terry Hadley, a spokesman for the Public Utility Commission of Texas, declined to comment. Oncor did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Berkshire and Energy Future declined to comment. Any deal for Oncor would have to receive approvals from the judge overseeing Energy Future’s bankruptcy, as well as federal and state regulators. Earlier this year, the Public Utility Commission of Texas rejected NextEra’s deal for Oncor, the largest network of power lines in the state, deeming that it was not in the public interest because it did not substantially ringfence Oncor’s finances. Another deal for Oncor led by privately held Hunt Consolidated Inc of Texas fell through in 2016 after regulators also put up roadblocks. Berkshire Hathaway had been among the leading bidders for Oncor in earlier auctions for the utility, according to the sources. Energy Future filed for Chapter 11 in April 2014 after it failed to meet its debt obligations as electricity prices weakened. This followed a $31.8 billion acquisition in 2007 by KKR & Co, TPG Capital Management LP and Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s private equity arm, the biggest leveraged buyout of all time that became the biggest bankruptcy ever.

353,BRKa,Buffett bets big on power with $9 billion Oncor deal,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) said on Friday it agreed to pay $9 billion to buy the parent of Texas power transmission company Oncor Electric Delivery Co, stepping up its pursuit of steady profits from utilities and infrastructure deals. If the all-cash purchase wins approval from federal and state regulators and a bankruptcy judge, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit will assume control of one of the largest U.S. electricity transmission companies. “Buffett views infrastructure bets as a good long-term investment,” said Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management Inc in Costa Mesa, California, which invests $300 million of the $1.4 billion it oversees in Berkshire. “With the relatively limited opportunities available to a company of Berkshire’s size, investments such as Oncor that are likely to yield 8 to 10 percent annually are acceptable,” Check added. The acquisition also highlights the growing prominence of Greg Abel, 55, Berkshire Hathaway Energy’s chief executive. Investors consider him a top candidate to succeed Buffett, 86, at the Omaha, Nebraska-based parent company’s helm. Abel and other Berkshire Hathaway Energy executives were not available on Friday for interviews. Buffett’s office did not respond to separate interview requests. Dallas-based Oncor delivers power to more than 3.4 million homes and businesses through roughly 122,000 miles (196,000 km) of transmission and distribution lines. It is 80 percent owned by Energy Future Holdings Corp, the company Berkshire has agreed to buy out of bankruptcy. Oncor posted $431 million of profit in 2016, and similar sums in the prior three years. Buffett values such consistency, telling Berkshire shareholders in February that utilities generate “recession-resistant” earnings because they offer an “essential service” that generates “remarkably steady” demand. Meanwhile, Abel said in a statement the companies “share a common goal of providing exceptional customer service and a commitment to invest in critical infrastructure.” Abel has also been deepening his commitment to renewable energy, including wind, generating tax credits that bolster Berkshire’s balance sheet. His unit also owns HomeServices of America, a big residential real estate brokerage. Berkshire Hathaway Energy typically generates nearly 10 percent of its parent’s profit, contributing $2.29 billion to an overall $24.07 billion in 2016. “Buffett has always had a lot of confidence in Greg Abel, and wouldn’t mind putting a nearly unlimited number of businesses under his watch,” Check said. The Oncor purchase requires approval by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), which in 2016 and 2017 scuttled takeover bids by privately held Hunt Consolidated Inc and NextEra Energy Inc (NEE.N). Regulators had asked for Oncor to be “ringfenced” so it would not assume excess debt from any acquirer, and also not pay out too much cash as dividends. Unlike NextEra, “Berkshire might be more willing to leave the ringfence in place and allow restriction on dividends, making the approval process “a little less cumbersome,” Cowen & Co analyst Amer Tiwana wrote in a research report. The PUCT is required by law to rule on Berkshire’s bid within six months of receiving an application. A spokesman declined to comment on Berkshire’s prospects. But Buffett wrote last year that regulators like Berkshire Hathaway Energy because it operates safely and efficiently and has “unlimited capital to fund whatever projects make sense,” without the need to pay dividends to its parent.  Berkshire expects to complete the Oncor purchase in the fourth quarter. It said the transaction implies an equity value of about $11.25 billion for Oncor. Kirkland & Ellis, a law firm representing Energy Future, said the transaction’s enterprise value was about $18.1 billion. Energy Future was created from the $45 billion leveraged buyout in 2007 of the former TXU Corp by KKR & Co, TPG Capital Management and Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s (GS.N) private equity arm. The buyout was a bet that natural gas prices would rise, allowing for higher electricity prices. Natural gas prices plunged instead, and Energy Future went bankrupt in 2014. Buffett had invested with Energy Future a decade ago, buying $2 billion of high-yield bonds. But he threw in the towel six years later, with an $873 million pre-tax loss. He has called that investment “a major unforced error.” Buffett entered the energy sector in 2000 when he led a group that bought Des Moines, Iowa-based MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co, later renamed Berkshire Hathaway Energy. He has since expanded in the central and western United States, such as with the Oregon-based PacifiCorp and Nevada-based NV Energy utilities. Berkshire has also forayed outside the United States, now owning the AltaLink electricity transmission company in Alberta, Canada and Northern Powergrid in Newcastle upon Tyne in England. Such bets have enabled Buffett to diversify Berkshire away from its traditional focus on insurance and stock-picking. Berkshire now owns more than 90 businesses including the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, Lubrizol chemicals and Dairy Queen ice cream. Assuming the Oncor transaction closes, Oncor CEO Bob Shapard would become executive chairman and be replaced by general counsel Allen Nye, under a previously announced plan.

355,BRKa,UPDATE 4-Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway nears $18 bln deal for Oncor -sources,"(Adds background on Oncor and Berkshire) By David French and Greg Roumeliotis July 6 (Reuters) - The energy unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc is nearing a roughly $18 billion deal to acquire Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC, people familiar with the matter said, three years after the utility’s parent entered bankruptcy. The deal is a bold bet by Buffett that he can win approval for the acquisition from Texas regulators, after they blocked two earlier attempts to sell Oncor, one of the largest U.S. power-transmission networks, to other companies. It also represents a return to a previously soured investment for Buffett, who in 2013 lost $873 million on a $2 billion bond investment in Oncor’s bankrupt parent, Energy Future Holdings Corp. Berkshire Hathaway’s deal, which could be announced by Friday, would value Oncor at slightly less than a previous $18.4 billion bid by Florida utility NextEra Energy Inc - which Texas regulators rejected - making it Buffett’s third biggest acquisition ever, two people said. The Wall Street Journal, which reported on the acquisition earlier, said the deal could be valued at more than $17.5 billion. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. A spokesman for the Public Utility Commission of Texas, which would have to approve the deal, declined to comment. Oncor did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Berkshire declined to comment. Any deal for Oncor, considered the most valuable among Energy Future’s assets, would also have to be approved by the judge overseeing the bankruptcy. Energy Future has been stuck in bankruptcy since it filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2014 as plans to sell Oncor, repay creditors and fund its exit have collapsed under regulatory scrutiny. KKR & Co LP, TPG Capital LP and Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s private equity arm took Energy Future private in 2007, in the biggest ever leveraged buyout with a total deal size of $44 billion. In the deal, the private equity firms also acquired Energy Future’s retail and power generation businesses, the largest in Texas, which also then later filed for bankruptcy. Earlier this year, the Public Utility Commission of Texas rejected NextEra’s deal for Oncor, deeming it not to be in the public interest. Another deal for Oncor led by privately held Hunt Consolidated Inc of Texas fell through in 2016 after regulators also put up roadblocks. Berkshire Hathaway had been among the leading bidders for Oncor. It is unclear what concessions Berkshire is prepared to make to meet the requirements of Texas regulators. Investors have prized regulated utilities such as Oncor for their steady cash flow. Adjusted operating cash flows rose 12.6 percent year-on-year in 2016, according to securities filings. Berkshire’s energy division, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, owns several other utilities, natural gas pipelines and electricity transmission businesses, including the PacifiCorp and NV Energy utilities in the western United States. The energy unit contributed $2.29 billion in profit last year, while Berkshire overall made $24.07 billion. A deal for Oncor would also help Buffett utilize some of Berkshire’s unused pile of cash, which totaled $96.5 billion at the end of March. The biggest creditor of Energy Future, activist investor Elliott Management Corp, filed a lawsuit against the company in May, asking it to pursue alternatives beyond the deal with NextEra. According to the lawsuit, Elliott wanted to lay the groundwork for a standalone plan of reorganization for Energy Future, allowing the utility to exit bankruptcy as an independent company, or find another buyer.

356,BRKa,Elliott proposes $18.5 billion Oncor deal to top Buffett,"(Reuters) - Elliott Management Corp, the largest creditor of the bankrupt parent of Oncor Electric Delivery Co, unveiled a plan on Monday to best Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s (BRKa.N) deal for the Texas utility with a bid worth $18.5 billion, including debt. Elliott revealed in documents published on its website it was unhappy with the recovery to some creditors under an $18.1 billion deal announced by billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire on Friday. The hedge fund believes its acquisition offer would result in a higher payout to debtholders. New York-based Elliott’s proposal to acquire Energy Future Holdings Corp calls for a complex conversion of its debt to equity and for an outside equity partner to help finance the deal. Reuters first reported on Elliott exploring a bid for Oncor on Friday. The offer from the hedge fund, which says it has more than $32 billion under management, would be a rare challenge to Buffett, who avoids auctions for companies and has told his investors he does not like to participate in bidding wars. But even without a competing bid, Buffett’s deal faces a difficult road securing the approval of a bankruptcy court judge without Elliott supporting it.  “We are extremely concerned that introducing a transaction with Berkshire at the current time will significantly undercut and potentially limit Elliott’s ability to provide a portion of the financing necessary to achieve the higher and otherwise superior transaction Elliott has proposed,” the hedge fund said in a letter to the board of Energy Future dated July 5 and released on Monday. Berkshire’s offer would help Energy Future exit its costly bankruptcy, which has stretched for over three years as other deals for its crown jewel Oncor fell apart. Energy Future’s power generation and retail electricity business were separated from Oncor and emerged from bankruptcy last year. Elliott, run by billionaire Paul Singer, also disclosed on Monday that it would keep in place a corporate “ringfencing” structure that would prevent debt from being added to Dallas-based Oncor, or too much cash being paid out as dividends.  Regulators in the utility’s home state of Texas have demanded such a structure. That was the reason Florida utility NextEra Energy Inc’s (NEE.N) $18.7 billion deal for the utility collapsed earlier this year. Berkshire Hathaway already has reached an agreement on a consensual approval process with regulators, according to a statement from an adviser to Energy Future filed in bankruptcy court. Oncor did not immediately comment on Elliott’s letter, while Berkshire was not immediately available for comment. Elliott declined to comment. Elliott’s disclosures came after Energy Future filed its new bankruptcy plan of reorganization on Friday. It proposed repaying the unsecured debt that Elliott holds at 18 cents on the dollar.  Should Elliott succeed in its offer for Energy Future its unsecured debt would have a recovery of 50 cents on the dollar, according to people familiar with the matter. Elliott holds $2.9 billion of Energy Future’s secured and unsecured debt, enough to try to block the reorganization plan with Berkshire, the people said.  Elliott built up most of its position in Energy Future’s debt after Texas regulators rejected NextEra’s offer earlier this year, causing bond prices to crash, the sources said. The hedge fund would break even on its debt investment if the Berkshire bid prevails because gains in some parts of its debt holdings, which would be paid out in full, would offset losses in the unsecured bonds it holds, where it would take a deep haircut, the people said. Elliott, known for its aggressive tactics including a 12-year battle over sovereign debt in Argentina, also may pursue litigation to block the deal, the sources said.  Elliott said in the letter it would support a deal with Berkshire or a third party if those bids exceeded the value proposed by the hedge fund. “We fear that the Berkshire transaction does not provide such value,” the hedge fund said in the letter. Oncor delivers power to more than 3.4 million homes and businesses through roughly 122,000 miles (196,000 km) of transmission and distribution lines.

364,BRKa,Elliott tells court it was barred from seeking Oncor financing,"WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - An attorney for Elliott Management on Wednesday complained to a bankruptcy court judge that the owner of Texas’s largest power distribution business did not provide the investment fund with information needed to line up financing for its offer of more than $18 billion to buy the company. Instead, Energy Future Holdings Corp, the bankrupt majority owner of Oncor Electric Delivery Co, struck a deal this month to sell its ownership of the business to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) for $9 billion in cash, valuing the company at $18.1 billion.  A lawyer for Elliott Management, which spent years battling Argentina over its defaulted debt, told the court that the fund has enough debt in Oncor’s parent, Energy Future, to block the Berkshire deal.  The fund has argued that its own $18.5 billion Oncor deal would be better for creditors. Gregg Galardi, Elliott’s lawyer, said potential sources of financing for a rival bid had contacted Elliott, a $32 billion fund led by billionaire Paul Singer, but Energy Future had ignored requests for information to help structure a deal. “We need actual cooperation,” he said. Galardi also noted that Energy Future had not run an auction. Chad Husnick, who represents Energy Future, countered that Elliott had not signed a non-disclosure agreement with Oncor and said Energy Future would not shop its Oncor stake when Elliott had no committed financing. “My response is, show me the money and we’ll consider it,” he said. Husnick also told the hearing in Wilmington, Delaware, that the Berkshire plan could be confirmed. Two previous deals for Oncor, with Hunt Consolidated Inc and another with NextEra Energy (NEE.N), were rejected by Texas’s Public Utility Commission after the plans were confirmed by the bankruptcy court. Husnick said the Berkshire proposal has already been discussed with PUC staff. He said Energy Future anticipates quick regulatory approval and then confirmation of the plan by the bankruptcy court, an approach that Judge Christopher Sontchi said he supported. Elliott has estimated creditors will be repaid around 24 cents on the dollar under the Berkshire proposal, compared to 80 cents under the deal NextEra Energy that was blocked by Texas regulators. A hearing on the schedule for reviewing the Berkshire plan was set for July 26. Energy Future has been in bankruptcy since 2014, filing after a consortium of private equity firms bought it for about $44 billion.

365,BRKa,"Buffett, Malone explore investment in Sprint: sources","(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp are exploring an investment of between $10 billion and $20 billion in U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp, people familiar with the matter said. Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, which controls Sprint, met Buffett and Malone separately this week at an annual gathering of business and media moguls in Sun Valley, Idaho, the sources said on Friday, confirming a report in The Wall Street Journal. Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure is also involved in the negotiations, the sources said.  Berkshire Hathaway is considering an investment of up to $20 billion in Sprint, while the amount that Liberty Media is looking to invest is not yet known, the sources said. Talks are in the early stages and could still fall apart, the people added. Shares of Sprint closed up 4.3 percent at $8.55 on Friday. The company has a market cap of $32.75 billion. Sprint and SoftBank declined to comment. Berkshire Hathaway and Liberty Media did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. A significant cash infusion in Sprint would give the debt-laden company flexibility and resources to continue its turnaround and invest in its network, the sources said, which could help it better compete in the fierce U.S. wireless industry. It would also relieve pressure from it having to strike a deal with T-Mobile US Inc, a unit of Germany’s Deutsche Telekom AG, which it held talks with earlier this year, sources said.  Despite regulatory hurdles, investors have long expected a deal between T-Mobile and Sprint, the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless service providers, anticipating cost cuts and other synergies. T-Mobile shares closed up 0.5 percent to $61.24 on Friday.  Sources said last month that Sprint had entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Malone’s Charter Communications Inc and Comcast Corp, which has put Sprint’s merger talks with T-Mobile US on hold until the end of July. Comcast and Charter in May agreed to a partnership that bars either company from entering into a material transaction in the wireless space for a year without the other company’s consent. But that agreement does not prevent Malone from engaging in discussions.  Unlike Malone, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts has shown little interest in his company investing in Sprint, the sources said.  Malone, the chairman of Liberty Media, in January raised the possibility that major cable companies could get together and buy a wireless carrier. Berkshire has never made telecommunications a major focus, and in 2016 it unloaded its stake in AT&T; Inc that it had held for less than a year after that company bought DirecTV, a Berkshire investment. Investing in or lending money to Sprint could help Buffett generate a higher return on some of Berkshire’s cash and equivalents, which totaled $96.5 billion on March 31. Berkshire has invested with Malone since 2011, when it took a stake in Liberty Media. As of March 31, Berkshire owned more than $5.4 billion of stock in three Malone companies: Liberty Media, international cable company Liberty Global Plc and Charter. Greg Maffei, Liberty Media’s chief executive, is also chairman of Sirius XM Holdings Inc, in which Berkshire held $887 million of stock as of March 31. It is unclear whether Buffett or his deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, oversee those stakes.

371,BRKa,Energy Future warns delay would kill Oncor sale to Buffett,"WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc will walk away from its $9 billion acquisition of Oncor Electric Delivery Co if the deal is delayed, an attorney for the parent company of Texas’ largest utility told a bankruptcy judge on Wednesday. Energy Future Holdings Corp, the bankrupt owner of Oncor, disclosed Berkshire Hathaway’s warning as the judge considers a request by the utility’s biggest creditor, hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, to hold up the deal with Buffett so it can put together its own $9.3 billion bid for Oncor. Berkshire Hathaway “may not go away forever, but they have told us and we have no reason to doubt them, that they will go away,” Energy Future’s lawyer Chad Husnick told U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Christopher Sontchi at a hearing in Wilmington, Delaware. “They may come back but it’s ... going to be for a lower price,” Husnick added. Berkshire Hathaway’s deal for Oncor is due to be approved by a bankruptcy court on Aug. 10, but Elliott is asking for a delay of 35 to 40 days so it can put together financing for its own bid for the utility. Roger Wood, a Moelis & Co investment banker representing Elliott, told the court that Elliott had secured $1.5 billion for its bid so far, significantly short of the $9.3 billion needed. He said 10 other investors had expressed interest in joining Elliott in the bid. If all of them put in the amount they had indicated, Elliott would  raise between $9.7 billion and $11.85 billion for the bid, he said. Some $3.7 billion of that investment interest came from a single investor in the form of proposed debt financing, Wood added. While Wood did not name the investors, he cited their interest to argue that Elliott needs more time to secure financing for the bid. If Elliott’s request for a delay is granted, Berkshire has the right to end its deal, according to court papers. Energy Future filed bankruptcy three years ago, and two earlier deals for Oncor fell apart after facing regulatory hurdles.

373,BRKa,UPDATE 2-Home Capital cedes gains as regulatory concerns weigh,"* Shares down 0.7 percent having been up 4.4 pct * Company repays loan from Berkshire Hathaway * Tougher regulations could impact lending (Recasts, adds analyst comment, updates shares) By Matt Scuffham TORONTO, July 26 (Reuters) - Shares in Home Capital Group Inc relinquished early gains on Wednesday as concerns about tougher mortgage regulations offset news it had paid back the balance of a C$2 billion ($1.60 billion) loan from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Repayment of the credit facility will significantly reduce the interest paid on borrowings going forward, Home Capital, Canada’s biggest non-bank lender, said after the market closed on Tuesday. Home Capital shares initially rose by 4.4 percent on Wednesday, having gained 8 percent on Tuesday, but were trading down 0.7 percent at C$14.49 at 1115 EST. Raymond James analyst Brenna Phelan said she viewed the repayment favorably but added the company’s outlook was clouded by the proposed introduction of tougher regulations by Canada’s financial regulator, and the dilutive impact on existing shareholders of a previously announced C$400 equity injection by Berkshire Hathaway, the second phase of which is subject to a shareholder vote in September. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) last month proposed banning “bundled” residential mortgages to clamp down on risky lending, six months after a Reuters investigation revealed that regulated mortgage providers were teaming up with unregulated rivals to circumvent rules limiting how much they can lend against a property. The OSFI also proposed stricter stress tests on uninsured mortgages. The changes “would likely put downward pressure on origination volumes given stricter debt service ratio tests and upward pressure on regulatory and compliance costs,” Phelan said Berkshire Hathaway has already taken a 20 percent stake in the company and will increase that to 38.4 percent, if shareholders approve the transaction in September. Some investors have objected on grounds that Berkshire Hathaway is receiving a significant discount on the shares. Home Capital executives say Berkshire Hathaway’s investment in the company is key to restoring confidence among investors, savers and borrowers after depositors withdrew 95 percent from its high interest savings accounts since late March. The withdrawals began after the company fired former Chief Executive Martin Reid on March 27. They accelerated after Canada’s biggest securities regulator, the Ontario Securities Commission, accused Home Capital of making misleading statements to investors about its mortgage underwriting business. Home Capital settled with the commission last month and accepted responsibility for misleading investors. Earlier this month, Home Capital appointed Yousry Bissada as its new chief executive, tasking the mortgage industry veteran with reviving the company’s fortunes.

374,BRKa,Elliott wins more time to beat Berkshire Hathaway's Oncor deal,"WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - A U.S. bankruptcy judge on Wednesday gave Elliott Management Corp 11 more days to formalize its plans to bid on Oncor Electric Delivery Co before the court approves the $9 billion offer for the utility from Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Judge Christopher Sontchi of the Delaware bankruptcy court pushed back the hearing for the approval of Berkshire’s merger agreement with Oncor, which carries a $270 million termination fee should it fall through, to Aug. 21 from Aug. 10.  Elliott, the largest creditor of Oncor’s bankrupt parent Energy Future Holdings Corp, said it needed more time to finalize the financing for its $9.3 billion offer, after securing about $1.4 billion in new equity for its bid so far. It had asked for a delay of 35 to 40 days. If billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire has not won court approval of its offer from the bankruptcy court by Aug. 21, it will walk away from the deal, Patrick Goodman, the chief financial officer of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, told Sontchi.  Berkshire’s all-cash bid already has regulators’ support and promises to pull Oncor, the largest utility in Texas, out of its more than three-year bankruptcy. Regulatory hurdles scuttled two earlier deals for Oncor. Roger Wood, a Moelis & Co investment banker representing Elliott, told the court that 10 other investors had expressed interest in joining Elliott in its bid. If all of them put in the amount they had indicated, Elliott would raise between $9.7 billion and $11.85 billion, he said.  “We would be oversubscribed,” Wood said. Some $3.7 billion of that investment interest came from a single investor in the form of proposed debt financing, Wood added. Chad Husnick, an attorney for Energy Future, warned earlier that if the court does not approve Berkshire’s deal on Aug. 21, and Elliott subsequently fails in its attempt to acquire Oncor, Berkshire may return but at a lower price. Elliott’s offer values Oncor at $18.5 billion including debt, above Berkshire’s current $18.1 billion valuation. Even if Berkshire’s deal for Oncor closes, Energy Future may still face an uphill battle winning Sontchi’s approval for its Chapter 11 reorganization plan. This is because Elliott, which owns more than two-thirds of a key piece of Energy Future’s unsecured debt, anticipates voting against the plan, people familiar with the matter said.  Sontchi could also be swayed by other creditors who favor a deal with Berkshire, which has said it can serve as a stable, long-term owner for Oncor.

376,BRKa,UPDATE 2-Berkshire profit falls as underwriting loss offsets railroad gains,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Friday reported a 15 percent drop in second-quarter profit, as lower investment gains and a loss from insurance underwriting offset improvement in its BNSF railroad business. Operating profit also fell short of analyst forecasts, though Berkshire attributed much of the decline to currency fluctuations and its accounting for a major contract with the insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N). Net income for Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire fell to $4.26 billion, or $2,592 per Class A share, from $5 billion, or $3,042 per share, a year earlier. Operating profit declined 11 percent to $4.12 billion, or $2,505 per Class A share, from $4.61 billion, or $2,803 per share. Analysts on average expected operating profit of about $2,791 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Buffett believes operating income is a better gauge of how Berkshire and its more than 90 businesses are doing than net income, which fluctuates more because it incorporates investment and derivative gains, which fell 64 percent from a year earlier. Book value per share, Buffett’s preferred measure of growth, rose 2.7 percent from the end of March to $182,816. The company’s stock price, meanwhile, set a record high on Friday, with Class A shares closing up $1,629.80 at $270,000. “They had a good quarter,” said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management Inc in Seattle, which owns Berkshire shares. “The results reflect Berkshire’s positioning in the U.S. economy.” BNSF saw profit rise 24 percent to $958 million, helped by high single-digit percentage increases in freight revenue from consumer and industrial products, and double-digit increases from agricultural products and coal. Profit from manufacturing, service and retailing units rose 10 percent to $1.66 billion, helped by greater demand for products from its IMC International Metalworking unit. Such gains helped offset a second straight quarterly loss from insurance underwriting, totaling $22 million compared with a year earlier $337 million profit. Berkshire said that weakness reflected losses from currency changes, higher claims payouts at the Geico auto insurance unit, and the amortization of deferred charges from its January agreement to take on long-term AIG property and casualty risks in exchange for $10.2 billion upfront. That contract helped boost float, or the amount of insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and which help fund Berkshire’s growth, to $107 billion from $91 billion at year end. Berkshire ended June with about $99.7 billion of cash and equivalents, plus large investments in shares of Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Coca-Cola Co (KO.N). It bought just over $3 billion of stocks in the quarter, and is poised to become Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) biggest shareholder by exercising stock warrants at below-market prices, for what would now be a $12.5 billion paper profit. Berkshire has found uses for some of its growing cash hoard. Its Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit, whose quarterly profit rose 7 percent, hopes to spend $9 billion to buy the parent of Texas power transmission company Oncor Electric Delivery Co out of bankruptcy. And in June, Buffett threw a C$2 billion financing lifeline to Home Capital Group Inc (HCG.TO), Canada’s largest nonbank lender, which was struggling with a deposit exodus and had admitted to concealing mortgage fraud. Thanks to Buffett, Home Capital said this week that issues over whether it can survive have been resolved. Berkshire’s operating businesses also including smaller units that sell such things as See’s Candies, Dairy Queen ice cream and Brooks running shoes.

379,BRKa,Berkshire profit falls as underwriting loss offsets railroad gains,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Friday reported a 15 percent drop in second-quarter profit, as lower investment gains and a loss from insurance underwriting offset improvement in its BNSF railroad business. Operating profit also fell short of analyst forecasts, though Berkshire attributed much of the decline to currency fluctuations and its accounting for a major contract with the insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N). Net income for Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire fell to $4.26 billion, or $2,592 per Class A share, from $5 billion, or $3,042 per share, a year earlier. Operating profit declined 11 percent to $4.12 billion, or $2,505 per Class A share, from $4.61 billion, or $2,803 per share. Analysts on average expected operating profit of about $2,791 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Buffett believes operating income is a better gauge of how Berkshire and its more than 90 businesses are doing than net income, which fluctuates more because it incorporates investment and derivative gains, which fell 64 percent from a year earlier. Book value per share, Buffett’s preferred measure of growth, rose 2.7 percent from the end of March to $182,816. The company’s stock price, meanwhile, set a record high on Friday, with Class A shares closing up $1,629.80 at $270,000. “They had a good quarter,” said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management Inc in Seattle, which owns Berkshire shares. “The results reflect Berkshire’s positioning in the U.S. economy.” BNSF saw profit rise 24 percent to $958 million, helped by high single-digit percentage increases in freight revenue from consumer and industrial products, and double-digit increases from agricultural products and coal. Profit from manufacturing, service and retailing units rose 10 percent to $1.66 billion, helped by greater demand for products from its IMC International Metalworking unit. Such gains helped offset a second straight quarterly loss from insurance underwriting, totaling $22 million compared with a year earlier $337 million profit. Berkshire said that weakness reflected losses from currency changes, higher claims payouts at the Geico auto insurance unit, and the amortization of deferred charges from its January agreement to take on long-term AIG property and casualty risks in exchange for $10.2 billion upfront. That contract helped boost float, or the amount of insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and which help fund Berkshire’s growth, to $107 billion from $91 billion at year end. Berkshire ended June with about $99.7 billion of cash and equivalents, plus large investments in shares of Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Coca-Cola Co (KO.N). It bought just over $3 billion of stocks in the quarter, and is poised to become Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) biggest shareholder by exercising stock warrants at below-market prices, for what would now be a $12.5 billion paper profit. Berkshire has found uses for some of its growing cash hoard. Its Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit, whose quarterly profit rose 7 percent, hopes to spend $9 billion to buy the parent of Texas power transmission company Oncor Electric Delivery Co out of bankruptcy. And in June, Buffett threw a C$2 billion financing lifeline to Home Capital Group Inc (HCG.TO), Canada’s largest nonbank lender, which was struggling with a deposit exodus and had admitted to concealing mortgage fraud. Thanks to Buffett, Home Capital said this week that issues over whether it can survive have been resolved. Berkshire’s operating businesses also including smaller units that sell such things as See’s Candies, Dairy Queen ice cream and Brooks running shoes.

381,BRKa,"Buffett's Berkshire adds Synchrony, sheds GE","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Monday said it added a stake in Synchrony Financial, boosting its bet on the credit card industry, and shed its investment in the company’s former parent, General Electric Co. The changes were among those disclosed in Berkshire’s quarterly report of its U.S.-listed stock holdings. Berkshire said it owned 17.5 million shares of Synchrony, a private label credit card issuer split off from GE in 2014, worth about $521 million as of June 30. It was already the largest investor in American Express Co, owning about one-sixth of that card issuer. Synchrony shares rose 4.6 percent in after-hours trading, likely reflecting what investors consider Buffett’s imprimatur. Smaller equity investments for Berkshire are normally made by Buffett’s deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, while Buffett focuses on bigger bets such as American Express, Apple Inc and Wells Fargo & Co. It is unclear who sold the GE investment, which was worth roughly $315 million at the end of March. Berkshire’s assistant did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Synchrony’s share price has yet to recoup the 16 percent decline it suffered on April 28 after it wrote off more soured loans, causing profit for the Stamford, Connecticut-based company to fall short of forecasts.  Berkshire may have viewed that as “an opportunity to load up,” Colin Plunkett, a Morningstar Inc analyst who covers Synchrony, said in an email. He said Synchrony remains undervalued, with a low degree of leverage, and “really has a big opportunity to return cash to shareholders.” Synchrony did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the second quarter, Berkshire trimmed its stakes in American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc and United Continental Holdings Inc, and boosted its stakes in Bank of New York Mellon Corp and General Motors Co. It also nearly eliminated a decade-old investment in Wabco Holdings Corp, which supplies commercial vehicle parts. Berkshire boosted its stake in Liberty Media Corp and reduced its holdings of Sirius XM Holdings Inc, both investments linked to billionaire John Malone.

395,BRKa,Elliott lawyer says third bidder may top Buffett's Oncor bid,"(Reuters) - An unidentified utility could pay $9.3 billion to buy Texas power transmission company Oncor Electric Delivery Co, topping Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s $9 billion bid, a lawyer for the largest creditor of Oncor’s parent told a U.S. bankruptcy judge on Friday. Such a bid would add to the competition that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s chief executive, faces for Oncor and could cause the Texas company to slip from his grasp. It could also scuttle plans of billionaire Paul Singer’s hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, the largest creditor of Oncor’s bankrupt parent, Energy Future Holdings Corp. Elliott has been trying to block Oncor’s sale to Berkshire and put together its own consortium to buy the company. A source close to Energy Future, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it had already received a $9.3 billion offer for Oncor, but would not disclose the bidder’s identity or other details.  An Elliott spokesman declined to comment on the identity of the utility, which the firm’s lawyer referred to in a public conference call with the judge, ahead of a scheduled Monday court hearing.  Energy Future did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Berkshire has said its deal represents the best chance for Oncor to emerge from more than three years of bankruptcy, but that it will walk away if the takeover does not win court approval at the Monday hearing. On Wednesday, Berkshire said it stood by its $9 billion offer and would not raise it. On Friday evening, after news of the third bidder surfaced, Berkshire said its offer had won support from five more Texas stakeholder groups. It said these included staff of the Public Utility Commission of Texas, a regulator whose approval is needed for an Oncor takeover. Any approval would likely involve ringfencing, restricting a buyer’s ability to tap Oncor’s cash and place more debt on it. Earlier this year, the regulator shot down the sale of Oncor to NextEra Energy Inc because it considered the proposed financial structure too risky for ratepayers. A separate plan to sell Oncor to a group of creditors and investors led by privately held Hunt Consolidated Inc of Texas collapsed in 2016, after hitting obstacles at the regulator. Berkshire’s all-cash bid has won praise from the commission’s executive director, Brian Lloyd.

On Wednesday, Berkshire said it stood by its $9 billion offer and would not raise it. On Friday evening, after news of the third bidder surfaced, Berkshire said its offer had won support from five more Texas stakeholder groups. It said these included staff of the Public Utility Commission of Texas, a regulator whose approval is needed for an Oncor takeover. Any approval would likely involve ringfencing, restricting a buyer’s ability to tap Oncor’s cash and place more debt on it. Earlier this year, the regulator shot down the sale of Oncor to NextEra Energy Inc because it considered the proposed financial structure too risky for ratepayers. A separate plan to sell Oncor to a group of creditors and investors led by privately held Hunt Consolidated Inc of Texas collapsed in 2016, after hitting obstacles at the regulator. Berkshire’s all-cash bid has won praise from the commission’s executive director, Brian Lloyd.

Elliott, a hedge fund and largest creditor of Oncor’s bankrupt parent Energy Future Holdings Corp, has been seeking to block Oncor’s sale to Berkshire Hathaway and put together a consortium to buy the company. A spokesman for Elliott declined to comment on the identity of the utility that the firm’s lawyer was referring to in a conference call with the judge ahead of court hearing on Monday.

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans said SCA Promotions Inc was entitled to half of its $11 million contract with Yahoo as a cancellation penalty. It rejected Yahoo’s claim that Dallas-based SCA improperly leaked the promotion to Buffett and Berkshire, while trying to line up insurance coverage for the grand prize. Berkshire is well-known for insuring against potentially costly events with long odds, such as picking a perfect “March Madness” bracket, as the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament is known. “Any information that SCA disclosed to Berkshire Hathaway was not confidential information,” Circuit Judge Edith Brown Clement wrote for a three-judge panel. Because SCA had kept Yahoo’s $1.1 million deposit, the appeals court on Monday awarded it another $4.4 million. The decision reversed a lower court ruling ordering SCA to return $550,000 of the deposit to Yahoo. “It has been a long battle over what we thought was a simple contractual provision,” Jon Patton, a lawyer for SCA, said in an interview. “We’re pleased the court of appeals got this right.” Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) bought Yahoo’s internet business in June, and put it in a unit called Oath.

401,BRKa,UPDATE 2-Sempra Energy to buy Oncor for $9.45 bln in blow to Berkshire,"(Reuters) - Utility Sempra Energy said on Monday that it would buy Oncor for $9.45 billion in cash after majority owner Energy Future Holdings Corp abandoned a deal to sell the power transmission company to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. This represents a rare blow to Buffett, who avoids bidding wars for companies and had swooped in two months ago to buy Oncor after Texas regulators blocked two previous attempts by Energy Future to sell it. Energy Future, which has been in bankruptcy since 2014, had initially planned to seek court approval on Monday for the sale of Oncor to Berkshire for $9 billion over opposition from its biggest creditor, hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. Instead, Energy Future lawyer Chad Husnick told the court the Dallas-based company had decided to “pursue another path” with Sempra because of the value of the bid, a lower break-up fee and, most importantly, support from Elliott. San Diego-based Sempra said it expected to own about 60 percent of a reorganized Oncor after it completes the transaction, which is valued at $18.8 billion, including debt. Energy Future owns 80 percent, but Sempra plans to sell some of that equity to other outside investors, according to people familiar with the matter. Sempra’s shares were up 1.2 percent at $117.79 after hitting an all-time high of $118.78 on Monday after the company said the deal would add about 10 million of Oncor’s Texas customers to its base and increase its earnings starting next year.  “They get to own 60 percent interest in a quality, growing Texas distribution utility,” said Gabelli & Co analyst Timothy Winter. “It’s a way for them to grow in a low-risk manner.” Utilities have become wary of their exposure to volatile energy prices and see power generation operations becoming less lucrative. Many of these companies are now hungry for electricity distribution assets, which have a growing demographic base and stable cash flows. “On the face of it, the transaction continues the long line of industry consolidation, which we continue to view as expensive,” Morningstar analyst Andrew Bischof wrote in a note. Elliott had tried to put together its own bid for $9.3 billion to buy Oncor but ultimately decided to back the Sempra deal, which a spokesman said “provides substantially greater recoveries to all creditors of Energy Future than the proposed Berkshire transaction.”  Berkshire, which bid for Oncor as part of its pursuit of steady profits from utilities and infrastructure deals, had said last week it would not raise its offer. In response to Sempra’s move, however, Berkshire said it would allow Energy Future to keep an Oncor dividend, but that proposal was not enough to bridge the gap in price, according to the sources. Judge Christopher Sontchi told the bankruptcy court on Monday that the new bid was a “big change” that would clearly benefit Energy Future and its creditors. “We are disappointed our agreement to acquire Oncor has been terminated,” Greg Abel, the chief executive officer of Berkshire’s energy unit, said in a statement. Many investors consider Abel a top candidate to eventually succeed Buffett, 86, at the Omaha, Nebraska-based parent company’s helm.  A hearing on the revised reorganization plan and creditor support agreement was set for Sept. 6 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. With Elliott’s support, Sempra is likely to get court approval for the deal.        The deal calls for Oncor General Counsel Allen Nye to become the company’s CEO, succeeding Bob Shapard, who becomes executive chairman.  Canadian pension fund manager Borealis Infrastructure Management Inc and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Special Investments Pte Ltd currently own 20 percent of Oncor.  Lazard Ltd and Morgan Stanley are financial advisers to Sempra, and White & Case LLP is its legal adviser. Evercore Partners Inc is the financial adviser to Energy Future, and Kirkland & Ellis LLP is its legal adviser.

402,BRKa,UPDATE 1-Sempra Energy to buy Oncor for $9.45 bln in blow for Berkshire,"(Reuters) - Sempra Energy (SRE.N) said it will buy Oncor for $9.45 billion in cash after Energy Future Holdings Corp, which indirectly owns Oncor, abandoned a deal to sell the power transmission company to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N). San Diego-based Sempra expects to own about 60 percent of a reorganized Energy Future after the transaction that is valued at $18.8 billion, including Dallas-based Oncor’s debt, it said late on Sunday. The development represents a rare blow for Buffett, who avoids bidding wars for companies and had swooped in two months ago to buy Oncor after two previous attempts by Energy Future to sell it were blocked by Texas regulators. In July, the energy unit of Berkshire Hathaway agreed to buy Oncor for $9 billion, but the deal ran into trouble after Energy Future’s biggest creditor Elliott Management Corp opposed the sale arguing it undervalued Oncor. Elliott also tried to put together its own bid for $9.3 billion to buy Oncor. Separately, Berkshire said last week it would not be raising its offer for Oncor, which delivers power to more than 3.4 million homes and businesses. “Elliott is supportive of the proposed Sempra transaction, which provides substantially greater recoveries to all creditors of Energy Future than the proposed Berkshire transaction,” a spokesman for Elliott said in an email to Reuters. Berkshire, which made the offer to Oncor in order to step up its pursuit of steady profits from utilities and infrastructure deals, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sources told Reuters earlier that Sempra had decided to make an offer for Oncor in the last three weeks, after seeing the opposition that Berkshire faced from Elliott. Energy Future’s board favored Sempra’s bid after it also offered assurances it could get its acquisition of Oncor approved by Public Utility Commission of Texas, as well as a U.S. bankruptcy judge, the sources said.     Sempra Energy said it expects the deal to be completed in the first half of 2018 and to add to earnings beginning next year. Allen Nye, who is currently Oncor’s general counsel, will succeed Bob Shapard as the company’s CEO. Shapard will be named executive chairman of Oncor.

403,BRKa,REFILE-UPDATE 3-Sempra snatches Oncor from Buffett with $9.45 bln bid-sources,"(Corrects preposition in paragraph 7) By Greg Roumeliotis Aug 20 (Reuters) - Bankrupt Texas utility Energy Future Holdings will abandon a deal to sell power transmission company Oncor to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc for $9 billion and will accept a $9.45 billion bid for Oncor by Sempra Energy instead, people familiar with the matter said. The development represents a rare blow for Buffett, who avoids bidding wars for companies and had swooped in two months ago to buy Oncor after two previous attempts by Energy Future to sell it were blocked by Texas regulators. It is also a defeat for Greg Abel, the 55-year-old chief executive of Berkshire’s energy unit who many investors consider a top candidate to eventually succeed Buffett, 86, at the Omaha, Nebraska-based parent company’s helm. Energy Future’s board decided to make the switch on Sunday after Sempra also offered assurances it could get its acquisition of Oncor approved by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), as well as a U.S. bankruptcy judge, the sources said. Berkshire had issued a statement last week to say it would not be raising its offer for Oncor. However, in response to Sempra’s bid, Berkshire offered to allow Energy Future to keep an Oncor dividend, but that proposal was not enough to bridge the gap in price, the sources added. The sources asked not to be identified because the decision has not yet been officially announced. Sempra and Berkshire did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Oncor and Energy Future declined to comment. The bidding war for Oncor underscores how power generation is becoming more commoditized and less lucrative in the eyes of utilities, which have become wary of their exposure to volatile energy prices. Instead, many utilities are now hungry for electricity distribution assets with a growing demographic base and stable cash flows. Dallas-based Oncor delivers power to more than 3.4 million homes and businesses through roughly 122,000 miles (196,000 km) of transmission and distribution lines. Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, which is Energy Future’s biggest creditor, had opposed the sale to Berkshire, arguing it undervalued Oncor and threatening to veto the deal. Elliott had also been trying to put together its own bid for $9.3 billion to buy Oncor. Sempra decided to make an offer for Oncor in the last three weeks, after seeing the opposition that Berkshire faced from Elliott as an opportunity to interlope, according to the sources. Elliott has now indicated it will support Oncor’s sale to Sempra, one of the sources said. Elliott did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Berkshire had told the PUCT it would accept “ringfencing” on its acquisition of Oncor, restricting its ability to extract cash from the company or add more debt to it. Sempra has now indicated it that will make similar concessions on ringfencing, according to the sources. Based in San Diego, Sempra owns and operates electric and gas utilities in the United Sates and South America, including San Diego Gas & Electric and SoCalGas in California, Luz del Sur in Peru, and Chilquinta Energía in Chile. It has a market capitalization of $29.2 billion. Sempra is no stranger to Texas. Earlier this year, it signed a memorandum of understanding with Korea Gas Corp for the development of a liquefied natural gas liquefaction project in Port Arthur, Texas. Earlier this year, the PUCT shot down the sale of Oncor to NextEra Energy Inc because it considered the proposed financial structure too risky for ratepayers. A separate plan to sell Oncor to a group of creditors and investors led by privately held Hunt Consolidated Inc of Texas collapsed in 2016, after hitting obstacles at the regulator. As a result, Energy Future has been stuck in bankruptcy since it filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2014, as plans to sell Oncor, repay creditors and fund its exit collapsed under regulatory scrutiny. Buyout firms KKR & Co LP, TPG Capital LP and Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s private equity arm took Energy Future private in 2007, in the biggest ever leveraged buyout with a deal size of $44 billion, including debt. But the debt pile placed on the company proved unsustainable, as Energy Future was hit by a steep decline in natural gas prices that in turn led to depressed power prices.

405,BRKa,Berkshire Hathaway no longer faces risk of S&P; downgrade,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s failure to clinch a $9 billion takeover of the Texas utility Oncor prompted S&P; Global Ratings on Tuesday to say the billionaire’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) is no longer at risk of a credit rating downgrade. S&P; affirmed Berkshire’s “AA” rating, its third-highest grade, with a “stable” outlook after Sempra Energy (SRE.N) struck an agreement with Oncor’s bankrupt parent Energy Future Holdings Corp on a $9.45 billion purchase. The rating agency had put Berkshire on review for a possible downgrade on July 7, reflecting concern about how adding Oncor would affect leverage. It said the stable outlook reflects Berkshire’s solid profitability and significant cash flow, the strong competitive position of many business units, and Buffett’s focus on boosting operating profit, which totaled $17.58 billion last year. Few U.S. companies have credit ratings as high as Berkshire’s, which itself carried a “triple-A” rating from S&P; as recently as February 2010. Moody’s Investors Service rates Berkshire “Aa2,” equivalent to S&P;’s rating. Barclays Capital analyst Jay Gelb said in a research report that the loss of Oncor leaves Berkshire with about $80 billion of cash for acquisitions, while leaving Buffett the cushion he wants for such things as payouts by Berkshire insurance units. At Berkshire’s annual meeting in May, Vice Chairman Charlie Munger suggested that the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate might be capable of a $150 billion acquisition.

410,BRKa,Buffett becomes Bank of America's top shareholder,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) has become Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) largest shareholder by exercising its right to acquire 700 million shares at a steep discount, more than tripling an investment it made six years ago. Berkshire is now the largest shareholder in the second- and third-largest U.S. banks, with stakes of roughly 6.6 percent in Bank of America and 10 percent in Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), according to Reuters data. It also has an interest in JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the largest U.S. bank, where Todd Combs, one of Buffett’s deputy portfolio managers, is a director. Bank of America on Tuesday said Berkshire exercised warrants to acquire its shares for roughly $7.14 each, well below their closing price of $23.58, down 14 cents from Monday. The announcement was made after U.S. markets closed. To pay for the shares, Berkshire swapped $5 billion of Bank of America preferred stock it had bought in August 2011. Its new common shares are worth roughly $16.5 billion, giving Berkshire a roughly $11.5 billion paper profit. Berkshire owns more than 90 businesses such as the Geico car insurer, Dairy Queen ice cream and the BNSF railroad. Buffett has run the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate since 1965.

411,BRKa,UPDATE 1-Buffett becomes Bank of America's top shareholder,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) has become Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) largest shareholder by exercising its right to acquire 700 million shares at a steep discount, more than tripling an investment it made six years ago. Berkshire is now the largest shareholder in the second- and third-largest U.S. banks, with stakes of roughly 6.6 percent in Bank of America and 10 percent in Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), according to Reuters data. It also has an interest in JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the largest U.S. bank, where Todd Combs, one of Buffett’s deputy portfolio managers, is a director. Bank of America on Tuesday said Berkshire exercised warrants to acquire its shares for roughly $7.14 each, well below their closing price of $23.58, down 14 cents from Monday. The announcement was made after U.S. markets closed. To pay for the shares, Berkshire swapped $5 billion of Bank of America preferred stock it had bought in August 2011. Its new common shares are worth roughly $16.5 billion, giving Berkshire a roughly $11.5 billion paper profit. Berkshire owns more than 90 businesses such as the Geico car insurer, Dairy Queen ice cream and the BNSF railroad. Buffett has run the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate since 1965. The billionaire turns 87 on Wednesday. The swap was made possible by Bank of America’s decision in June to boost its dividend 60 percent, after the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender passed a Federal Reserve “stress test” of its ability to navigate tough markets.

414,BRKa,Warren Buffett tells CNBC he has not sold a share of Apple,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett told CNBC on Wednesday that he had not sold a share of Apple (AAPL.O) and was not concerned about Wells Fargo (WFC.N) as a long-term investment, calling it a “terrific” bank. Buffett, chairman and chief executive of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), said about Apple compared to IBM (IBM.N): “I feel more certain about the future as I look at a company like Apple than when I look at IBM now.”  Berkshire has disclosed a roughly $20 billion stake in Apple. Buffett owned about 81 million shares of IBM at the end of 2016 and sold about a third of them in the first and second quarters of 2017, CNBC reported in May, citing Buffett.  Buffett also said Wednesday that he continued to have faith in investments in Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Wells Fargo. Berkshire has become Bank of America’s largest shareholder by exercising its right to acquire 700 million shares at a steep discount, more than tripling an investment it made six years ago. When asked if U.S. food company Kraft Heinz (KHC.O) would buy Mondelez (MDLZ.O), Buffett said: “I think the answer is no on that.” He also said Kraft Heinz, which Berkshire controls along with Brazilian firm 3G Capital, would not again seek to buy Unilever Plc (ULVR.L).  Kraft Heinz withdrew its proposal for a $143 billion merger with larger rival Unilever Plc, the companies said in February. Following a six-month cooling off period required by UK takeover law which expired this month, there has been speculation over whether Kraft Heinz would come back for another shot at Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever.  “That was a misunderstanding, basically. We will not make hostile takeover offers, and we did not intend that to be hostile, but it turned out it was, and we immediately the next day, when I learned about it, we called it off,” Buffett said on Kraft Heinz’s bid.  When asked why he was silent about U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, Buffett said: “I am not in the business of attacking any president, nor do I think I should be.” He had supported Hillary Clinton in last year’s presidential election.

On Tuesday, all major indexes ended higher recovering from steep losses at the open after Trump responded to North Korea’s missile test over Japan that “all options are on the table”. But, Trump tweeted on Wednesday that the “U.S. has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer.” “We suspect the North Korea problem, although not yet causing a rush to exit will eventually take a negative toll on the markets,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. Investors will closely watch Trump’s first speech specifically on tax policy later in the day. The speech, officials said, would be about “why” reforming the tax code was needed, not about “how” to reform it. “Trump’s outline of tax reform today is likely to be well received by the markets,” Cardillo said. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Harvey made its second landfall in Louisiana on Wednesday, pouring down more water after setting rainfall records in Texas. Crude oil prices slid, while gasoline futures hit their highest since mid-2015 on Wednesday as flooding and damage from Harvey shut over a fifth of U.S. refineries. Gross domestic product increased at a 3.0 rate in the April-June period, the Commerce Department said in its second estimate. The upward revision from the 2.6 percent pace reported last month reflected robust consumer spending as well as strong business investment. Another report by payroll processor ADP showed U.S. private employers added 237,000 jobs in August for its biggest monthly increase in five months, above the  183,000 jobs expected by economists. The ADP report comes ahead of the more comprehensive government payrolls data for August on Friday.

417,BRKa,UPDATE 4-Wells Fargo uncovers more fake accounts in drawn-out scandal,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co hiked the tally of accounts that were potentially opened without customers’ knowledge by over a million on Thursday after an expanded review of improper sales practices.  The revelation is the latest chapter in a year-long scandal at the San Francisco bank and puts it back in the crosshairs of lawmakers as they prepare to return to Congress next week. Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading voice on consumer finance issues, tweeted “Unbelievable” after Wells Fargo said it had found an additional 1.4 million accounts were potentially opened without permission, bringing the total estimate to about 3.5 million.  She repeated her call for the bank’s top brass to appear before the Senate Banking Committee. “Every new disclosure seems to expand the scope of the bank’s troubles, which creates the perception that the scandal is getting bigger rather than going away,” said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with Cowen Washington Research Group. “We believe the political and regulatory spotlight will continue to shine brightly on Wells Fargo. That is likely to limit the ability of the bank to grow aggressively.” The scandal over phony accounts first erupted last September, when Wells Fargo reached a $190 million settlement with regulators over the matter. That led to the departure of its veteran chief executive John Stumpf, a divisive shareholder meeting and disclosures of other sales practice problems ranging from unwanted auto insurance to improper mortgage fees. Once lauded on Wall Street for its ability to sell more products to customers than any of its big-bank rivals, Tim Sloan, who took over as chief executive last year, faces a long slog to revive the bank’s reputation. The problems reported on Thursday came after a third party hired by Wells Fargo examined accounts stemming back to 2009, a broader timeframe than a review conducted last year. The bank previously disclosed the expanded review in a quarterly securities filing, but not its results. Wells will return $2.8 million to customers who appear to have had consumer and small business accounts opened without permission. It also uncovered about 528,000 potentially unauthorized online bill pay enrollments, a newly disclosed problem, and will return $910,000 to customers who were affected. The bank also faces multiple regulatory probes and private lawsuits. A pending settlement for one private lawsuit led Wells to review accounts dating back to 2002, Sloan said on a conference call with reporters. “With the expanded analysis now complete, we will focus on remediation and making things right for our customers,” he said. The unauthorized online billpay fees were small, Sloan said, often $1. They resulted from branch employees setting up accounts in order to achieve product sales goals that have since been eliminated. The bank has refunded these amounts. Wells Fargo shares were down 0.8 percent in early afternoon trading, underperforming the S&P; Financial which was flat.  The additional refunds amount to a tiny fraction of the bank’s quarterly earnings, but investors who spoke to Reuters in recent weeks said they were less worried about the hard costs than a degradation of the bank’s once-pristine brand. They also expressed concern about Wells becoming an easy political target going into the midterm elections. Warren Buffett, who runs Wells Fargo’s largest investor, Berkshire Hathaway Inc, said this week he still considers it a great bank despite selling some of his holdings. But he acknowledged the bank will likely find more problems now that it is shining a light in dark places. “There’s never just one cockroach in the kitchen,” he said on CNBC.

419,BRKa,Home Capital investors spurn Buffett's plan to boost stake,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Home Capital Group Inc’s (HCG.TO) shareholders on Tuesday rejected a proposal for Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway to raise its stake in the company, voting against the board’s recommendation in a third defeat for the U.S. billionaire this year. Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services last month recommended shareholders vote against the proposal, which called for Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) to increase its shareholding from 20 percent to 38.4 percent. Home Capital Chairwoman Brenda Eprile told a special meeting of shareholders that 88.79 percent of votes cast were against the proposal, with 11.21 percent in favor. The deal would have allowed Berkshire Hathaway to buy new shares in the company at a price of C$10.30 per share, a deep discount to Home Capital’s closing price of C$14.08 on Monday, which would have impacted the overall value of Home Capital shares. Shares of Home Capital seesawed after resuming trading at midday, initially falling as much as 3 percent and gaining as much as 3.3 percent. They closed up 1.78 percent at C$14.33. Concerns over the potential dilution were alleviated by the vote, but analysts remain concerned about what impact tougher rules on mortgage lending in Canada will have on the business.   “We continue to view pending regulatory changes as well as a moderating housing price environment as limits on meaningful earnings growth,” said Raymond James analyst Brenna Phelan.  Berkshire did not respond to a request for comment.  Last month, 87-year-old Buffett’s effort to buy the Oncor Electric utility in Texas ended in failure, when his $9 billion bid was topped by a $9.45 billion offer from Sempra Energy (SRE.N).    In February, Berkshire had committed $15 billion to help Kraft Heinz Co’s (KHC.O) purchase of Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS), but the proposed takeover was pulled after the Anglo-Dutch consumer products company rejected it.     Home Capital and Berkshire agreed in June to a deal worth up to C$400 million ($329 million) for an initial stake of 20 percent in the business. The agreement enabled Berkshire to increase its stake subject to shareholder approval. Buffett took his stake in the company and provided a C$2 billion credit facility after investors withdrew more than 90 percent of funds from Home Capital’s high-interest savings accounts earlier this year.  The withdrawals accelerated after April 19, when the Ontario Securities Commission accused Home Capital of making misleading statements to investors about its mortgage underwriting business. Home Capital reached a settlement with the commission in June and accepted responsibility for misleading investors. Home Capital said the terms of the credit facility, on which it does not currently have funds drawn, remain unchanged. Eprile reiterated the board’s belief that the deal would have been in the best interest of the company but said the vote reflected the progress the company has made in its turnaround plan. “This decision is a clear message that the majority of our shareholders believe that Home Capital’s improved deposit inflows and liquidity position diminish the need for additional capital,” she said.

The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P;/TSX composite index closed up 103.11 points, or 0.69 percent, at 15,143.41, its biggest gain since June 1. Gains for the index came as investor concerns about U.S. tensions with North Korea eased and the financial impact from Hurricane Irma appeared less severe than feared, helping to push stocks on Wall Street to a record high. “There has been such a lag in Canada that there is definitely a catch-up trade to be had here,” said Mike Archibald, associate portfolio manager at AGF Investments. “It is just a case of can we get a catalyst to get it moving.” After rallying 17.5 percent in 2016, the TSX has dipped 0.9 percent this year. That compares with a 11.5 percent gain this year for the S&P; 500. One drag on Canada’s market in 2017 has been lower oil prices. But oil rose on Tuesday after OPEC forecast higher demand in 2018. U.S. crude oil prices settled 16 cents higher at $48.23 a barrel, while the energy group, which accounts for 20 percent of the weight of the TSX, gained 1.4 percent. Nuvista Energy Ltd jumped 4.8 percent to C$6.84 after it reaffirmed its 2017 guidance. Potash producer Agrium Inc edged 0.1 percent higher to C$124.44 and Potash Corp of Saskatchewan rose 0.1 percent to C$22.20 after Canada’s Competition Bureau said it will not challenge their proposed merger. Eight of the index’s 10 main groups ended higher. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 0.8 percent, helped by gains for gold miners as the precious metal bounced up from the lowest level in more than a week. The heavyweight financials group gained 0.7 percent, with Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s largest bank by market capitalization, gaining 0.8 percent to C$91.82 and insurer Manulife Financial Corp adding 1.5 percent to C$24.92.

425,BRKa,American Express wins dismissal of lawsuit over lost Costco contract,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American Express Co (AXP.N) has won the dismissal of a lawsuit accusing the credit card services company of defrauding shareholders about the loss in 2015 of a lucrative co-branding relationship with Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O). In a decision made public on Monday, U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan rejected claims that American Express improperly downplayed the risk its 16-year relationship with Costco might end, and concealed how the warehouse chain had generated 8 percent of its revenue and 20 percent of its loans. While the proposed class-action complaint alleged that Costco might have viewed American Express as “just another vendor” that could be shunted aside for a “cheaper” rival, the judge said American Express merely viewed such statements as evidence that Costco would “drive a hard bargain,” not walk away. The plaintiffs were led by the Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 137 Pension Fund in Springfield, Illinois. Its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. American Express spokeswoman Marina Norville said the New York-based company was pleased with the decision, which was dated Sept. 30. The judge said the plaintiffs may amend their complaint. The market value of American Express fell by roughly $8 billion in the two days after the company, whose largest shareholder is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), disclosed the loss of the Costco contract, which moved to Visa Inc (V.N). American Express has long traditionally focused on affluent customers who often pay bills on time, but has been encouraging some cardholders to borrow more and earn more rewards. This summer, American Express announced a plan to let cardholders pay off purchases of $100 or more in installments, which could result in more fees. American Express shares closed Monday up 8 cents at $90.54, roughly 6 percent below their all-time high set in 2014. The case is Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 137 Pension Fund v American Express Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-05999.

430,BRKa,Goldman creates 'brain trust' in effort to boost deals business,"Oct 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is betting it can get its money-making mojo back by pitching creative deals to big, complex clients, marking a return to its investment banking roots as trading revenue slows. The Wall Street bank is forming a group, known internally as the Innovation Lab, focused on generating compelling deal ideas for companies like Warren Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc or Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp’s $93 billion investment fund, people familiar with the matter said. The new “brain trust,” as one insider called it, is aimed at supercharging investment banking revenue as trading, for many years Goldman’s profit engine, has faltered amid regulations and market trends that hurt the bank more than rivals. From 2009-2016, Goldman’s annual trading revenue fell by more than $18 billion, or 32 percent, while investment banking revenue rose by $1.3 billion, or 26 percent. That trend has accelerated this year. Analysts expect Goldman to reveal more trading pain when it reports third-quarter results on Tuesday, building on two consecutive quarters of declines. After facing angry questions from shareholders, Goldman last month unveiled a plan to boost annual revenue by $5 billion. Management has emphasized Goldman’s roots as a strategic adviser to corporations, wealthy families and investment funds, and has also expanded into areas like consumer lending. But while fees from those services can be more reliable than trading, analysts say Goldman will not replace the income from its stock and bond market heyday any time soon. “Many investors still view it as a ‘show me’ story because the initiatives are in businesses that are highly competitive,” said Steven Chubak, a banking analyst with Instinet. A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment on the new group. Led by Goldman dealmakers Brian DeCenzo and James Morris, the group will perform a different role than traditional bankers focused broadly on pitching mergers and acquisitions to big companies, the people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media. The group is expected to come up with out-of-the box ideas and focus on clients who want to acquire or make big investments in businesses across industries, and do not fit neatly into individual categories, like technology or industrials, that sector bankers already cover. Berkshire owns more than 90 businesses across aerospace, energy industrials, financials, transportation, consumer products and food. Meanwhile, SoftBank’s Vision Fund has invested in companies ranging from satellite startup OneWeb to asset manager Fortress Investment Group LLC. On top of spotting deal opportunities, the new team will analyze broad trends like the impact of oil prices across various sectors. DeCenzo and Morris were previously part of Goldman’s financial sponsors group, which scouts deals for private equity firms. The group is the latest change under new management of the investment bank, which earlier this year elevated Gregg Lemkau and Marc Nachmann as co-heads alongside John Waldron. Under their leadership, the business has added bankers to cities like Atlanta and Dallas to serve local clients more closely, and hired dealmakers at the partner level from Wall Street rivals. They have also installed programmers alongside dealmakers to increase productivity and give clients better advice.

431,BRKa,UPDATE 5-Kenneth Chenault to step down as AmEx CEO after nearly 17 years,"(Reuters) - American Express Co said its chairman and chief executive Kenneth Chenault would step down early next year, ending a nearly 17-year tenure at the helm of the No. 1 U.S. card issuer by spending. Chenault, 66, will be succeeded by Vice Chairman Stephen Squeri, 58, effective Feb. 1, the company said on Wednesday. Squeri, a 32-year company veteran, served as group president of global corporate services before taking over as vice chairman in July 2015. American Express shares were barely down at $91.70 in after-hours trading. Chenault, who was widely expected to retire, spent the last two years firefighting after the company lost a lucrative partnership with warehouse club retailer Costco Wholesale Corp, which accounted for about 8 percent of the spending on its cards. The stock lost roughly a fifth of its value in 2015, after the deal ended. The breakup shook up the credit card industry, driving business from millions of customers to other card companies. “He probably would have hung it up about two years ago and then he decided to stick through (after) all the bad news ... just to help them ride out that rough period,” Kyle Sanders analyst Edward Jones said. “I think Steve carries on with the strategies that Ken has already had in place; I wouldn’t expect a major shift in how AmEx operates.” AmEx is also battling competition from U.S. banks targeting its affluent clientele. Bank of America last month launched its Premium Rewards credit card, joining rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup. Chenault, one of the few African American CEOs in Wall Street, has allayed some investor concerns. The stock is up about 22 percent this year. Chenault joined the company in 1981. “Ken’s been the gold standard for corporate leadership and the benchmark that I measure others against. He led the company through 9/11, the financial crisis and the challenges of the last couple of years,” said billionaire Warren Buffett. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc is American Express’ largest shareholder.     Separately, AmEx also reported a 19 percent rise in quarterly profit, helped by loan growth and higher card member spending. The company raised its full-year 2017 earnings per share expectations to $5.80 to $5.90, from $5.60 to $5.80. This is the first quarter without the impact of the loss of the Costco partnership.

432,BRKa,China automaker BYD sees 2017 profit down as much as 20 pct,"SHANGHAI, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Chinese automaker BYD Co Ltd , backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, said on Sunday that its annual profit would likely fall by as much as a fifth amid rising competition in the hybrid and electric car markets. China has set strict targets for carmakers to shift to so-called new-energy vehicles (NEVs), triggering a rush of companies looking to tap into potential demand for less-polluting cars in the world’s biggest auto market. BYD, which has invested heavily in hybrid and electric vehicles, forecast full-year net profit would fall by between 15.1 percent to 20 percent to a range of 4.04 billion yuan ($607.54 million) to 4.29 billion yuan, it said in filings on the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock exchanges. Net profit in 2016 rose 80 percent to 5 billion yuan. China has signalled a long-term aim to shift towards new-energy vehicles, but has also been phasing out subsidies for the market, raising concerns from some automakers that consumer demand alone will not be enough to drive sales. China’s overall car market has also slowed this year after a tax break for smaller cars was cut back. BYD said January-September net profit fell 23.8 percent to 2.79 billion yuan. In August it had forecast a drop of roughly 20 percent to 25 percent. Third-quarter net profit fell 23.9 percent from a year earlier to 1.07 billion yuan. Sales of new-energy vehicles in the wider China market in January-September totalled 398,000, up 37.7 percent from 2016, industry data showed.

434,BRKa,UPDATE 3-New Akzo Nobel boss pursues $30 billion deal with Axalta,"AMSTERDAM/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Dutch paints maker Akzo Nobel, seeking to recover after rejecting a takeover offer and issuing two profit warnings, is discussing a merger with smaller U.S. rival Axalta Coating Systems Ltd to create a $30 billion company. Akzo, the maker of Dulux paint, said on Monday it was in “constructive talks” about a “merger of equals” in what would be the first major deal by Chief Executive Thierry Vanlancker, who took over in July after Akzo spurned a 26 billion euro ($30.2 billion) offer from U.S. rival PPG Industries. Reuters reported on Friday that Akzo had approached Axalta about a possible merger, sending Axalta’s shares 17 percent higher. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest Axalta investor with a stake of just under 10 percent.  “This seems a classic attack-is-the-best-defense strategy,” said a fund manager at one of Akzo’s top-10 investors who asked not to be named. “Akzo overpromised after defending their own company and started to fail to deliver in Q3, so (they) need to do something transformational,” he added. At 19.5 billion euros ($22.7 billion), Akzo’s market value is close to three times that of Axalta at $8.1 billion at Friday’s closing price of $33.15. Even after the planned sale of its chemicals divisions, valued at 8-10 billion euros, the Dutch group would tower over its prospective partner, suggesting a lead role that typically results in a premium being offered to the junior partner. Akzo said plans to divest the chemicals unit remained on track and a “vast majority” of net proceeds from the deal would be returned to shareholders. Axalta’s coatings for new vehicles could fill a gap in Akzo’s portfolio, which caters to various other industries including manufacturing, marine and construction, analysts have said. The relatively fragmented global paints and coatings industry has seen a frenzy of deal activity, as buyers seek scale to squeeze their raw materials bill to further bolster already attractive margins.  PPG’s aborted move for Akzo followed BASF deals last year, selling its industrial coatings business to Akzo and buying Albemarle’s surface-treatment unit Chemetall for $3.2 billion to focus on automotive coatings. Before that, Sherwin-Williams snatched up rival U.S. paint company Valspar in an all-cash deal valued at about $9.3 billion. The mooted combination would make Akzo the second-largest coatings player with a 12 percent market share, ahead of PPG but trailing an enlarged Sherwin Williams, analysts at brokerage Raymond James said. Vanlancker has been forced to cut targets made in the heat of the takeover battle twice in the space of six weeks, blaming disruption caused by hurricane Harvey, rising raw materials costs and “headwinds” at its marine coatings business. Akzo shares were 0.5 percent higher at 77.89 euros at 1120 GMT, well below a figure of around 96 euros proposed by PPG. Analyst Joost van Beek of Theodoor Gilissen said that in negotiations over financial terms, Axalta would seek to take advantage of Akzo being under pressure to bulk up.  Analysts at Bernstein, in turn, stressed the strategic rationale, saying in a note the Akzo-Axalta merger “would improve scale and density in segments and countries where needed while taking out costs, most likely in the fragmented general industrial segment and in Europe”. They forecast savings of around 250 million euros from combining operations. Akzo would not comment on how the deal could be structured, though describing it as a merger suggests it would pay mostly with shares.     Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday that talks were at an early stage and there was no guarantee the companies would come to an agreement. Akzo has gone through tumultuous times of late. After PPG’s approach was fended off, a group of shareholders launched a court case seeking a vote to have Chairman Antony Burgmans removed, but lost.  Akzo’s CEO and CFO then resigned, citing health reasons, while Burgmans is due to retire next year. PPG has indicated it is no longer interested in trying to buy Akzo. After walking away from the deal on June 1, it is barred from rebidding for Akzo until Dec. 1. Private equity firm Carlyle Group LP, Axalta’s former owner, had considered selling the company to Akzo in 2014 before taking it public.

436,BRKa,"UPDATE 2-AIG swings to quarterly loss, adds $836 mln to reserves","NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss on Thursday as the insurer booked huge catastrophe losses, and said it had set aside $836 million to meet losses related to prior-year accident claims. Hefty losses from claims occurring in prior years have been an ongoing issue for AIG, and its shares were down 2.3 percent at $63.51 in extended trading after it reported third-quarter results. The New York-based company is one of the largest U.S. commercial insurers. In February, AIG also posted a bigger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss, largely due to a $5.6 billion reserve charge to cover possible future claims related to long-term risks on U.S. commercial insurance policies it had already written. AIG agreed in January to pay about $10 billion to a unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) to take on the bulk of the risk associated with those policies. The Berkshire deal followed a $3.6 billion increase to reserves chalked up by AIG in the last quarter of 2015. Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault, widely hailed in the industry as a turnaround expert, took charge of AIG in May. He replaced Peter Hancock, who said in March that he would step down after the insurer’s financial performance frustrated shareholders and the insurer’s board of directors. AIG conducts quarterly reviews of reserves for its various lines. In August, AIG Chief Financial Officer Sid Sankaran said the insurer had boosted the number of reviews it conducted during the second quarter, compared to the previous year. The insurer reviewed about $16 billion in total reserves, in challenging areas such as medical malpractice and environmental, Sankaran said at the time. In the third quarter ended Sept. 30, the insurer recorded pre-tax catastrophe losses of $3 billion related to hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, in line with previously disclosed estimates. Insurers and reinsurers across United States had issued profit warnings after the storms tore into parts of the country and ravaged several Caribbean islands. AIG swung to a net loss of $1.74 billion, or $1.91 per share, in the quarter, compared with a profit of $462 million, or 42 cents per share, a year earlier. Operating loss was $1.22 per share compared with an operating profit of $1.01 per share in the year-ago period.

437,BRKa,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-AIG swings to quarterly loss, adds $836 mln to reserves","(Corrects largest to fourth largest in 2nd paragraph and that Hancock resigned in March, not February, in 5th paragraph.) Nov 2 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss as the insurer booked huge catastrophe losses, and said it set aside $836 million to meet losses related to prior-year accident claims. The company’s shares were down 2.3 percent at $63.51 in extended trading on Thursday. Hefty losses that surface from prior-year claims have been an ongoing issue for the New York-based insurer.  AIG is the fourth largest U.S. underwriter of commercial property and casualty policies for 2016 premiums written, according to the Insurance Information Institute. In February, the insurer posted a bigger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss, largely due to a $5.6 billion reserve charge to cover possible future claims related to long-term risks on U.S. commercial insurance policies it has already written. AIG agreed in January to pay about $10 billion to a unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc to take on the bulk of the risk associated with those policies. The Berkshire deal followed a $3.6 billion increase to reserves chalked up by AIG in the last quarter of 2015. Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault, widely hailed in the industry as a turnaround expert, took charge of the company in May. He replaced Peter Hancock, who said in March that he would step down after the insurer’s financial performance frustrated shareholders and the insurer’s board of directors. AIG conducts quarterly reviews of reserves for its various lines. In August, AIG Chief Financial Officer Sid Sankaran said the insurer had boosted the number of reviews it conducted during the second quarter, compared to the previous year. The insurer reviewed about $16 billion in total reserves, in challenging areas such as medical malpractice and environmental, Sankaran said at the time. In the third quarter ended Sept. 30, the insurer recorded pre-tax catastrophe losses of $3 billion related to hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, in line with previously disclosed estimates. Insurers and reinsurers across United States had issued profit warnings in the wake of the hurricanes that tore into parts of the country, while ravaging several islands in the northern Caribbean. AIG swung to a net loss of $1.74 billion, or $1.91 per share, in the quarter, compared with a profit of $462 million, or 42 cents per share, a year earlier. Operating loss was $1.22 per share compared with an operating profit of $1.01 per share in the year-ago period.

439,BRKa,"Hurricanes, earthquake drag down third-quarter profit at Buffett's Berkshire","(Reuters) - Bad weather hurt Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc in the third quarter, as insurance losses tied to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and an earthquake in Mexico contributed to a 43 percent drop in profit. Berkshire on Friday said it lost $3 billion before taxes, or $1.95 billion after-tax, from the disasters, leaving its Geico auto insurance, General Re reinsurance and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance units with underwriting losses for the year. Insurance typically accounts for about one-fourth of Berkshire’s overall profit. Berkshire has roughly 90 businesses in such sectors as chemicals, energy, food and retail and industrial products. It also owns the BNSF railroad. Jim Shanahan, a senior analyst at Edward Jones & Co, said the disaster losses were higher than he had expected, given how pricing pressures had caused Berkshire to retrench from some business, but said shareholders should remain comfortable with the company over the long term. Overall net income fell to $4.07 billion, or $2,473 per Class A share (BRKa.N), from $7.2 billion, or $4,379 per share, a year earlier. Operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses and which Buffett says better reflects company performance, fell 29 percent to $3.44 billion, or $2,094 per Class A share, from $4.85 billion, or $2,951 per share a year earlier. That missed analysts’ average operating profit forecast of $2,402.47 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s diversification helped cushion the earnings decline, as profit rose at the Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit, while “improving economic conditions” helped boost shipping and profit at BNSF. A better economy may also have persuaded more people to buy cars and trucks, as higher financing activity at the Berkshire Hathaway Automotive car dealership unit helped boost pre-tax retail profit by 22 percent. Book value per Class A share, measuring assets minus liabilities, rose 2.5 percent in the quarter to $187,435, and was up 8.9 percent from January to September. Berkshire also ended September with $109.3 billion of cash and equivalents, more than five times the $20 billion minimum Buffett has said he prefers, and investors are waiting to see what he does with it. Buffett, 87, has run Berkshire since 1965, and investors have remained confident in his leadership, as the company’s share price has risen 15 percent this year. The Class A shares closed Friday down $2,963.99, or 1 percent, at $280,470.01, while Class B shares (BRKb.N) fell $1.34, or 0.7 percent, to $187.27. Both were about 2 percent below their Oct. 24 record highs. FULL-YEAR UNDERWRITING LOSS LIKELY Berkshire lost $1.44 billion from insurance underwriting in the quarter and $1.73 billion from January to September, putting it on pace for its first full-year underwriting loss since 2002. It had even eked out a small underwriting profit in 2005, the year of Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, Rita and Dennis. But investment income from insurance operations cushioned the blow, rising 23 percent in the quarter to $1.04 billion. Other insurers and reinsurers, such as Allstate Corp (ALL.N), American International Group Inc (AIG.N) and Swiss Re AG (SRENH.S), also suffered larger quarterly storm losses, and like Berkshire are hoping to boost rates. Berkshire’s results also reflected an accounting charge tied to its January agreement to assume many of AIG’s policies in exchange for $10.2 billion upfront. But that and other premiums that Berkshire receives before paying claims have helped boost its insurance “float” to $113 billion, giving Buffett more money to invest. Shanahan, who rates Berkshire a “buy,” said he was encouraged at how Geico is adding market share, reflected in a 16.5 percent jump in premiums and 9.9 percent year-over-year growth in policies. Some of Berkshire’s cash hoard will eventually be used to buy 80 percent of Pilot Flying J, the largest U.S. truck stop operator. Buffett announced that investment on Oct. 3. Berkshire also owns shares in dozens of companies including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), and has a 26.7 percent stake in food company Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O).

Berkshire cut its IBM stake 32 percent in the third quarter to about 37 million shares worth $5.37 billion from 54.1 million shares worth $8.32 billion, according to a Tuesday regulatory filing detailing its U.S.-listed stock holdings.

450,BRKa,"UPDATE 4-Nippon Paint makes proposal to Axalta, merger talks with Akzo Nobel end","NEW YORK/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Nippon Paint Holdings Co Ltd made an all-cash offer on Tuesday to acquire U.S. coatings company Axalta Coating Systems Ltd, two people familiar with the matter said, ending merger talks between Axalta and Dutch peer Akzo Nobel. Nippon Paint confirmed it has made “a proposal” to Axalta but declined to give details, adding there is no assurance the two will reach any agreement. Axalta and Akzo Nobel said earlier on Tuesday they had ended negotiations about a “merger of equals” because they were unable to reach terms.  Axalta, whose largest shareholder is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, said it continued to pursue other “value-creating alternatives” although it did not disclose Nippon Paint’s role, if any, in the termination of the discussions. Nippon Paint, Japan’s biggest paint supplier and 39 percent owned by Singapore-based investment company Wuthelam Holdings Ltd, made the all-cash offer at a premium to where Axalta shares ended on Monday at $33.54, one of the sources said. The offer was credible enough for Axalta to end negotiations with Akzo Nobel, the source added.  It was not clear how far the negotiations with Nippon Paint would progress, and Axalta could also choose to engage in deal talks with other interested parties, the second source said. Axalta has a market capitalization of $8.2 billion while Nippon Paint has a market capitalization of 1.2 trillion yen ($10.7 billion).  Nippon Paint shares fell 4.5 percent on Wednesday morning before trade was suspended in the wake of the Reuters report. The Osaka-based company has previously expressed a desire to expand in the United States and Europe to become a “global paint major”. Axalta shares reversed losses in extended trading hours in New York after Reuters reported on Nippon’s offer, to trade up 3.3 percent at $35.01. For Akzo Nobel, the breakdown in the talks with Axalta marks the end of a difficult year in which it rejected a 26 billion euro ($30.5 billion) takeover offer from PPG Industries Inc, in favor of a standalone plan.  Based on Dutch takeover rules, PPG could return with a new offer as early as next month. However, PPG CEO Michael McGarry has indicated his company is no longer interested after Akzo Nobel spurned three offers in March and April. Akzo said in a statement it would now continue to pursue that strategy of selling or seeking a stock market listing for its specialty chemicals division, which has an estimated value of up to 10 billion euros. Akzo Nobel promised to return the “vast majority of proceeds to shareholders”. The failure of the talks comes days before Akzo Nobel’s shareholders are to meet on Nov. 30 to approve the demerger of its specialty chemicals arms. Since PPG walked away in June, former Akzo Nobel CEO Ton Buechner and former CFO Maëlys Castella have resigned, citing health reasons, while Chairman Antony Burgmans is due to retire in April. Akzo Nobel’s new CEO, Thierry Vanlancker, said in a statement on Tuesday the company remained focused on the strategy developed under Buechner and Burgmans. For Nippon Paint, an Axalta deal would help it crack open the U.S. market and boost earnings from automotive coatings, SMBC Nikko Securities analyst Shinobu Takeuchi wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.  “However, we would focus on how the firm plans to execute an all-cash buyout, which would demand considerable capital,” the Tokyo-based analyst said.  In March, Nippon Paint acquired U.S. paint company Dunn-Edwards Corp for $608 million.

RV shipments are expected to hit 505,600 in 2017, a 17.4 percent jump from last year, and then hit 520,700 in 2018, according to the association. “Each and every month this year was the best on comparable record for that month,” said Frank Hugelmeyer, the RVIA’s president, speaking at a trade show in Louisville, Kentucky. RV sales are quick to suffer when consumer confidence wilts, as happened during the Great Recession. Shipments plunged by a third in 2008 and then fell more than 30 percent in 2009. But in 2010, as the economy recovered and discretionary spending revived, sales surged more than 46 percent. Low gasoline prices have helped fuel sales in recent years, as have low interest rates that have eased financing of items that range in price from $10,000 to $1 million. The vast bulk of shipments - an estimated 444,100 units this year - are so-called towables. The rest are motor homes.  Prices of RVs have increased by an annual rate of 2 percent since 2007, the RVIA says.  Michael Happe, chief executive of Winnebago Industries Inc. (WGO.N), a major manufacturer, says Americans of all ages are increasingly focused on health and outdoor living, which helps fuel sales of his company’s products.  But there are other reasons for the industry’s growth. Happe noted that there are more vehicles than ever on the road, such as large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, that are capable of pulling trailers. “And they’re not just being used by snowbirds going from New York to Florida,” he said. More people are working out of RVs, such as oil-patch and seasonal workers, and there is growing demand for RVs used for tailgating at sport events. Winnebago is based in Forest City, Iowa, but RV manufacturing is heavily concentrated in northern Indiana, which produces about 85 percent of the U.S.’s RVs. Indiana is home to the two largest producers, Thor Industries Inc. (THO.N) and Forest River Inc., owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N). The production boom has strained labor markets in the region, with many factories struggling to expand quickly enough to meet demand.

452,BRKa,UPDATE 3-Axalta ends Nippon Paint talks after rejecting $9.1 billion bid,"(Reuters) - Axalta Coating Systems (AXTA.N) has ended talks with Japan’s Nippon Paint Holdings Co Ltd (4612.T) about a potential sale, the U.S. coating company said on Thursday, following the rejection of what sources said was a $9.1 billion all-cash bid. The development makes Nippon Paint the latest unsuccessful suitor for Axalta, whose largest shareholder is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N). Axalta previously ended talks with Dutch paint maker Akzo Nobel NV (AKZO.AS) about a merger earlier this month.  “While neither deal came to fruition, the keen interest by these companies underscores Axalta’s global leadership position. We are well positioned to continue as a standalone growth company and will remain disciplined in generating superior long-term value for our shareholders,” Axalta CEO Charles Shaver said in a statement.  Nippon Paint, Japan’s biggest paint supplier and 39 percent owned by Singapore-based investment company Wuthelam Holdings Ltd, has been looking to expand into the U.S. market and boost earnings from automotive coatings. Axalta said Nippon Paint’s board was “unwilling” to meet Axalta’s expectations regarding the value of the company. Nippon Paint’s latest cash offer valued Axalta at $37 per share, but Axalta wanted more, according to two people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss confidential details.  Nippon Paint confirmed the two companies had ended talks, adding that it would continue to look for M&A; opportunities. The company’s shares surged more than 10 percent in early trading in Tokyo.  Axalta shares were trading in New York at $37.25 before they were halted on Thursday afternoon ahead of Axalta’s announcement, indicating that investors were expecting a deal at a higher price. The shares dropped 17 percent on news of the terminated deal talks to $31.19. “While some M&A; premium may linger in the stock, for the most part we expect (Axalta) investors  to  shift  their  focus  back  to  end-market  trends becoming healthier, pricing catching up to raw materials, and small-bore consolidation opportunities,” Jefferies LLC analysts wrote in a note.  A deal with either Nippon or Akzo Nobel was seen as attractive by Axalta, because neither suitor appeared to present significant antitrust risk with regulators. However, agreeing on financial terms proved challenging. Axalta’s talks with Akzo Nobel ended over disagreements about how much premium Axalta shareholders deserved in what was branded as a merger of equals. Akzo Nobel wanted its shareholders to own 63 percent of the combined company, which Axalta considered excessive, according to the sources. Akzo Nobel also wanted to keep much of its current governance arrangements, including keeping the top job with Akzo Nobel CEO Thierry Vanlancker and maintaining the combined company Dutch with headquarters in Amsterdam, the sources said. It had offered Shaver the chairman role, the sources added.   The negotiations between Akzo Nobel and Axalta came to a head early last week, when Vanlancker and his top lieutenants flew to New York to meet with Shaver, according to the sources. “We had a very strong click with Axalta, but we were only ever interested in a merger. We were never prepared to pay a premium for a takeover, partly because of the outlook for the automotive industry,” Vanlancker told an Akzo Nobel shareholder meeting on Thursday. Akzo Nobel gained shareholder approval on Thursday to spin off its 10 billion euro ($11.9 billion) chemicals division as part of plans to placate investors after deal talks with Axalta ended and it rebuffed a takeover bid earlier this year from U.S. rival PPG Industries Inc (PPG.N). A compulsory six-month cooling off period for PPG expires on Friday, which means it could return with another bid. PPG CEO Michael McGarry has said that the company has “moved on” from Akzo and is now seeking other growth opportunities.

453,BRKa,M&T; Bank's CEO Robert Wilmers dies -bank,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - M&T; Bank’s chairman and chief executive officer, Robert Wilmers, died on Saturday night at home after nearly 35 years leading the Buffalo, New York-based company, the bank said on Sunday.  Wilmers, 83, was succeeded by Robert Brady, the bank’s lead outside director who assumed the position of non-executive chairman, according to a statement from the bank.  The bank’s three vice chairmen, Richard Gold, Rene Jones and Kevin Pearson, will oversee M&T; Bank’s daily operations.  Wilmer oversaw massive growth in the bank’s assets, which rose to $120 billion in 2017 from $2 billion when he took over in 1983. He also spearheaded a regional expansion that took the bank to nearly 800 branches across the eastern United States from about 50 in one state.  In a statement from the bank, Berkshire Hathaway CEO and M&T; shareholder Warren Buffett described Wilmer as “a remarkable banker ... and a wonderful friend.” ",12172017,http://www.reuters.com/article/mt-bnk-us-ceo-death/mt-banks-ceo-robert-wilmers-dies-bank-idUSL1N1OH0JT
454,BRKa,"UPDATE 4-CSX investors seek clarity after CEO death, stock stabilizes","(Reuters) - CSX Corp’s stock stabilized on Monday in a sign of confidence that acting Chief Executive Officer Jim Foote can steer the No. 3 U.S. railroad in the short-term, following the sudden death of the firm’s CEO on Saturday.  However, analysts and investors said longer term a more experienced executive may be needed to implement the complex turnaround plan begun by deceased CEO Hunter Harrison. Harrison’s death at the age of 73 came just eight months into his dramatic restructuring campaign designed to boost profits and streamline operations through cost cuts and operational changes. These changes also triggered service disruptions, customer complaints and federal scrutiny.  CSX shares have risen about 48 percent this year and about 6 percent since March after Harrison, who led turnarounds of two Canadian railroads, was hired as CEO in a high-stakes push by activist investor Paul Hilal of investment fund Mantle Ridge LP. Shares fell around 10 percent on Friday after CSX said late on Thursday that Harrison would be taking medical leave. But by Monday afternoon they pared some losses, rising 1 percent to $53.42 on the day. CSX Chairman Edward Kelly said in a statement on Saturday that Harrison’s death was due to unexpectedly severe complications from a recent illness, calling it a major loss to the company. Harrison used an oxygen tank when he met investors last month and also at a regulatory hearing in October. He had previously taken medical leave from Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd in 2015 after surgery and a bout with pneumonia.  Given his medical history, CSX’s board initially asked for an independent physician to review Harrison’s medical records. Harrison refused, providing instead a letter from his doctor saying he was fit for the job, the company said. Two corporate attorneys said investors would have a difficult time successfully suing the board over breach of duty, given Harrison’s known medical history. LONG-TERM CHOICE? Investors and analysts questioned whether Foote would be the long-term choice to run the company given his primary expertise is sales and marketing, rather than operations. Foote is familiar with Harrison’s working style from when he worked under Harrison during the turnaround of Canadian National Railway Co, but has been with CSX for about two months and has never headed a major railroad. “I do expect Jim to be named CEO, although I also think the board will proactively study (and look to fill) any gaps in the team,” said Taylor Glasebrook, associate portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, the No. 8 shareholder in CSX with 10.5 million shares. “The next opportunity for management to calm investors is in January when they report the year-end results,” Glasebrook said. Foote told investors on Friday he believes the “real heavy lifting has been done” and there will be “modifications and changes that we will make.” “Even though Jim Foote is a capable leader we do not see him as the long-term solution as the CEO given his strength is marketing and the company is embarking on an operations-focused turnaround,” Cowen and Co. analyst Jason Seidl said in a note. Some investors were using the volatility to look at the possibility that CSX could become an acquisition target. “People are definitely taking out their notebooks and doing the math that CSX becomes a takeover target,” said one CSX investor who asked not to be named. He said CSX “won’t be a buying opportunity until (the price per share) gets back into the $40s range.” But any potential railroad merger would face significant regulatory hurdles.  While CEO of Canadian Pacific, Harrison made a failed bid for No. 4 U.S. railroad Norfolk Southern. Crucial to that failure was lobbying by other major railroads and statements from No. 2 U.S. railroad BNSF, owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, that it would look to buy another railroad if left at a competitive disadvantage.

456,BRKa,Bargain Bin: ETFs for value hunters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Think of the stock market right now as a high-school cafeteria. The most popular kids in school are growth investors, high-fiving and riding a multi-year bull run. Meanwhile, the geeky kids off to the side, eating lunch by themselves, are the value investors. But those geeks often end up on top as adults. So even in this growth-oriented economy, you would be wise to have a value component to your portfolio. For a double bargain, look to value-driven exchange-traded funds, which not only offer rock-bottom management fees but in some cases have been matching or even exceeding the broader market in gains. “Given how strong a bull market we have had, there will be an inevitable rotation to value,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at independent advisory firm CFRA. “In fact, value has already showing signs of improvement.” Take the Deep Value ETF from TWM funds. As the name implies, the fund contains in its top 10 holdings the stocks of a number of firms that have been battered, most notably in retail, including Macy’s Inc, Target Corp, Kohls Corp and Gap Inc.  Also represented in the Deep Value fund are some long-in-the-tooth tech firms like Seagate Technology PLC and Xerox Corp, and pharma play Gilead Sciences Inc. The result is an average price-earnings ratio of around 13, well below the S&P; 500’s collective P/E which is now over 25. Those beaten-up names might make investors a little queasy, especially since this ETF is so concentrated with just 20 stocks. But you cannot argue with the performance: It boasts one-year returns of 23.1 percent, matching the S&P; 500, to add to 2016’s 24.8 percent. Other value ETFs have been picking up bargains, while the rest of the universe obsesses over growth. Another standout is Guggenheim Investments’ S&P; Pure Value ETF. It sifts through the S&P; 500, eliminates all growth stocks and the so-called “muddle in the middle,” and comes up with 114 pure value plays. Among its top holdings is telecom provider CenturyLink Inc, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, agriculture play Archer Daniels Midland Co and General Motors Co. The one-year performance is 17.2 percent, with five-year gains at 16 percent annually - not bad for a supposedly out-of-favor strategy. “Since we’ve been in a market where growth has outperformed, many investors are now looking at value’s relative appeal,” said William Belden, Guggenheim’s director of ETF development. “And over time, a value tilt tends to outperform its growth peers.” The $890-million fund also boasts an affordable expense ratio of .35 percent. In the fund’s rebalancing in December financial and utilities were trimmed back, thanks to their recent runups, while consumer discretionary stocks were boosted. A word of caution for value-minded investors: Such deep-value and pure-value screens tend to make holdings more limited, and therefore more volatile, than broader market indices. Investors wary of concentrated bets should perhaps look to a larger, steadier ship like Vanguard’s Value Index Fund. This fund, five-star-rated by Chicago-based research shop Morningstar, contains 329 total stocks and annualized returns of 15.2 percent over five years. Its biggest holdings are familiar blue-chippers like Microsoft Corp, Johnson & Johnson, JP Morgan Chase & Co and Exxon Mobil Corp. Perhaps best of all for value-conscious investors, its expense ratio is a microscopic 0.06 percent. Part of the appeal of value ETFs is that when the next downturn comes, high-flying growth stocks will likely get pounded more than reliable blue chips. Value stocks traditionally provide more downside protection, in part due to their dividend payouts which provide a share-price floor and attract income investors.

458,BRKa,Berkshire may get $37 billion book value boost from U.S. tax cuts: Barclays,"(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc, the conglomerate run by Warren Buffett, may see its book value grow by $37 billion because of U.S. tax law changes enacted by President Donald Trump, Barclays Capital analysts estimated on Monday. Book value, a key performance measure for Buffett reflecting assets minus liabilities, probably rose by 12 percent in the final quarter of 2017 because Berkshire can lower its tax bill on investments that have risen in value, Barclays analysts led by Jay Gelb wrote. That would leave Berkshire valued at about 1.39 times book value, which Gelb called “attractive,” though it would remain above the 1.2 ratio that could prompt Buffett to authorize share repurchases. Berkshire has said it ended September with $86.6 billion of income tax liabilities, which were mainly deferred. Gelb, who rates Berkshire “overweight,” also said lower taxes could boost by 12 percent the earnings power from Berkshire’s more than 90 operating units, such as the BNSF railroad and Geico auto insurance. Though the tax changes would not add to the Omaha, Nebraska-based company’s roughly $109 billion of cash and equivalents, Gelb said any large all-cash acquisition would likely immediately boost Berkshire’s earnings per share.  Trump last month signed into law a reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Buffett had told CNBC in October that if the corporate rate changed significantly in 2018, “it would pay me something.” Through 2016, Berkshire’s book value per share grew at an annualized 19 percent since Buffett took over the company in 1965. That topped the 9.7 percent annualized gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 including dividends. Berkshire does not pay a dividend. Barclays on Monday also raised its price target for Berkshire Class A shares to $357,000 from $322,500, three weeks after the shares reached $300,000 for the first time. It raised its target for Berkshire Class B shares to $238 from $215. Berkshire usually releases year-end results and Buffett’s annual shareholder letter on the last Saturday in February.

460,BRKa,"UPDATE 6-Buffett succession gains clarity as Berkshire promotes Abel, Jain","(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Wednesday promoted two of its top executives, Gregory Abel and Ajit Jain, adding them to its board and cementing their status as the front runners to succeed Warren Buffett atop the conglomerate.     Abel, 55, the chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, was named Berkshire’s vice chairman for non-insurance business operations, while Jain, 66, Berkshire’s top insurance executive, was named vice chairman for insurance operations.     Buffett, 87, remains chairman and CEO of the roughly $500 billion conglomerate he has run since 1965. Charlie Munger, 94, who has worked at Buffett’s side for more than four decades, remains vice chairman.     Both Buffett and Munger will continue handling major capital allocation and investment decisions, including acquisitions, for Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, though they have reduced their responsibilities in recent years with their increasing age.     “It is probably fair to say it’s not just the Warren and Charlie show any more,” said David Rolfe, who oversees $5 billion of assets at Wedgewood Partners Inc in St. Louis, whose largest holding is Berkshire.     “Today’s news codifies the importance of Greg Abel and Ajit Jain to not just their current businesses, but their future authority once Buffett relinquishes the CEO title,” Rolfe added.     In an interview on CNBC, Buffett called Abel’s and Jain’s new roles “part of the movement toward succession” at Berkshire.     “They are the two key figures at Berkshire” and “have Berkshire in their blood,” he said.     Many investors view Abel as the favorite to become CEO, citing his age and experience in acquisitions and operations.     Still, Paul Lountzis, president of Lountzis Asset Management LLC in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, said,  “Shareholders should be happy that these large, large contributors to Berkshire’s value are now vice chairmen and on the board.” Both he and Rolfe consider Abel the top CEO candidate.         Berkshire has more than 90 operating units including the BNSF railroad, Geico auto insurance, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, See’s Candies and a variety of industrial and chemical operations.     While Munger had the idea to make Abel and Jain vice chairmen, Buffett said managing a large portion of Berkshire, including input on smaller acquisitions, would provide valuable experience to his successor.     Buffett dismissed the idea of a horse race between Abel and Jain for the top job.     “They know each other well, they like each other well, they both have their areas of specialty,” he said.    Berkshire’s board will grow to 14 members from 12 with the addition of Abel and Jain.     Buffett, who first publicly raised the succession issue more than a decade ago, said he remained in “remarkably good health” and that his health was not a factor in making the announcement. “Maybe six weeks ago,” he said, “I just decided, ‘Why not now?’”     While Buffett has no plans to quit soon, when asked how long he expected to remain at the helm, he said: “Ten years would be a long time.”     Munger told CNBC he thought Berkshire shareholders had “seven or more good years coming out of Warren,” but “not very many” out of him, saying, “I have to face reality.” None of the executives was immediately available for interviews.     Berkshire’s Class A shares closed up 1.3 percent at $308,350.00. Its B shares also rose 1.3 percent, to $205.61. Abel, who grew up in Alberta, joined Berkshire Hathaway Energy in 1992. His Iowa-based unit now runs several power companies in the United States, Canada and Britain, as well as natural gas pipelines and solar and wind farms.     Jain, a native of India who joined Berkshire in 1986, runs the reinsurance operations, providing coverage against major catastrophes and unusual risks.     Berkshire’s insurance businesses employed roughly 44,000 people at the end of 2016, while businesses that Abel will oversee employed about 323,000.     Still, insurance remains critical to Berkshire, recently contributing $113 billion of “float,” or premiums collected before claims are paid, for Berkshire to invest. Buffett, the world’s third-richest person according to Forbes magazine, has long said Jain has probably made more money for Berkshire than he has.     “If Jain becomes CEO it would be great, but the complexity of the insurance business requires someone there with more day-to-day supervision,” Rolfe said.     In the CNBC interview, Buffett repeated that Berkshire’s board, whose members include Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates, can install a new chief executive within a day when he steps down, dies or becomes incapacitated.     Abel and Jain became the apparent front runners after Munger singled them out as “world-leading” performers in a 2015 letter to Berkshire shareholders.     Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who are Buffett’s investment deputies, are expected eventually to succeed Buffett as Berkshire’s chief investment officer.     Buffett’s eldest son, Howard, is expected to become Berkshire’s non-executive chairman, to help preserve the company’s culture.

466,BRKa,"Berkshire promotes potential Buffett successors Abel, Jain","(Recasts to add details about Abel, Jain, Buffett succession planning) Jan 10 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Wednesday promoted two of its top executives, Gregory Abel and Ajit Jain, cementing their widely viewed status as potential successors to Warren Buffett as the conglomerate’s chief executive. Abel was named Berkshire’s vice chairman for non-insurance business operations, and Jain was named vice chairman for insurance operations. Both were also added to Berkshire’s board, increasing the number of directors to 14 from 12. Abel is the chairman of the company’s Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit, which he joined in 1992, while Jain is executive vice president at National Indemnity Co and oversees Berkshire’s reinsurance operations. He joined Berkshire in 1986. Investors and analysts have long considered Abel and Jain the top candidates to eventually succeed Buffett, 87, as chief executive, though Abel is more than a decade younger. For now, Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 94, will remain responsible for Berkshire’s major capital allocation and investment decisions, including acquisitions. Berkshire has long said that it will be ready to install a new chief executive should Buffett step down, die or become incapacitated. Speculation that Abel and Jain were the top candidates grew after Munger singled them out for praise in a 2015 letter to Berkshire shareholders. Buffett’s investment deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, are in position to eventually succeed Buffett as Berkshire’s chief investment officer, while Buffett’s son Howard is expected to become Berkshire’s non-executive chairman.

468,BRKa,Berkshire energy unit names CEO to replace potential Buffett successor,"(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s energy unit on Thursday named William Fehrman as its new chief executive to replace Gregory Abel, who was promoted a day earlier to oversee more Berkshire units, and potentially succeed Warren Buffett. Fehrman, 57, joined the energy unit, Berkshire Hathaway Energy Co, in 2006. He had been chief executive of its MidAmerican Energy Co subsidiary, which provides electric and natural gas service in four Midwest U.S. states, and BHE Renewables, which builds wind and solar farms. Adam Wright, 40, a MidAmerican vice president, will become that unit’s new chief executive. Berkshire on Wednesday added Abel, 55, and Ajit Jain, 66, who oversees its reinsurance operations, to its board of directors, and gave them new oversight over its more than 90 business units.     This confirmed expectations of many investors and analysts that Abel and Jain are the frontrunners to become Berkshire’s chief executive whenever Buffett, 87, is no longer in charge.    Berkshire Hathaway Energy is 90 percent-owned by Berkshire, and has in recent quarters generated roughly one-sixth of its Omaha, Nebraska-based parent’s operating profit. This included $1.98 billion for the parent in the first nine months of 2017.    The unit serves the central and western United States, Alberta, Canada and Britain, and operates HomeServices of America, the majority owner of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices and one of the largest U.S. residential real estate brokerages. Fehrman, through a spokeswoman, had no comment. Berkshire Hathaway Energy used to be called MidAmerican Energy but rebranded itself in 2014.  It is one of several Berkshire units to take its parent’s name, which is closely associated with Buffett, the world’s third-richest person and one of its most admired investors. Abel has used big acquisitions to help expand Berkshire Hathaway Energy, but had a setback last year when his $9 billion offer for Texas power transmission company Oncor was trumped by a higher bid from San Diego-based Sempra Energy.    Berkshire Hathaway Energy has not disclosed Fehrman’s expected compensation. Abel was awarded more than $58 million, mainly in incentive pay and bonuses, in 2015 and 2016. Buffett typically receives less than $500,000 in annual compensation, including security to keep him safe, to run Berkshire.

471,BRKa,"Buffett succession gains clarity as Berkshire promotes Abel, Jain","(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Wednesday promoted two of its top executives, Gregory Abel and Ajit Jain, adding them to its board and cementing their status as the front runners to succeed Warren Buffett atop the conglomerate.     Abel, 55, the chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, was named Berkshire’s vice chairman for non-insurance business operations, while Jain, 66, Berkshire’s top insurance executive, was named vice chairman for insurance operations.     Buffett, 87, remains chairman and CEO of the roughly $500 billion conglomerate he has run since 1965. Charlie Munger, 94, who has worked at Buffett’s side for more than four decades, remains vice chairman.     Both Buffett and Munger will continue handling major capital allocation and investment decisions, including acquisitions, for Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, though they have reduced their responsibilities in recent years with their increasing age.     “It is probably fair to say it’s not just the Warren and Charlie show any more,” said David Rolfe, who oversees $5 billion of assets at Wedgewood Partners Inc in St. Louis, whose largest holding is Berkshire.     “Today’s news codifies the importance of Greg Abel and Ajit Jain to not just their current businesses, but their future authority once Buffett relinquishes the CEO title,” Rolfe added.     In an interview on CNBC, Buffett called Abel’s and Jain’s new roles “part of the movement toward succession” at Berkshire.     “They are the two key figures at Berkshire” and “have Berkshire in their blood,” he said.     Many investors view Abel as the favorite to become CEO, citing his age and experience in acquisitions and operations.     Still, Paul Lountzis, president of Lountzis Asset Management LLC in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, said,  “Shareholders should be happy that these large, large contributors to Berkshire’s value are now vice chairmen and on the board.” Both he and Rolfe consider Abel the top CEO candidate.         Berkshire has more than 90 operating units including the BNSF railroad, Geico auto insurance, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, See’s Candies and a variety of industrial and chemical operations.     While Munger had the idea to make Abel and Jain vice chairmen, Buffett said managing a large portion of Berkshire, including input on smaller acquisitions, would provide valuable experience to his successor.     Buffett dismissed the idea of a horse race between Abel and Jain for the top job.     “They know each other well, they like each other well, they both have their areas of specialty,” he said.    Berkshire’s board will grow to 14 members from 12 with the addition of Abel and Jain.     Buffett, who first publicly raised the succession issue more than a decade ago, said he remained in “remarkably good health” and that his health was not a factor in making the announcement. “Maybe six weeks ago,” he said, “I just decided, ‘Why not now?’”     While Buffett has no plans to quit soon, when asked how long he expected to remain at the helm, he said: “Ten years would be a long time.”     Munger told CNBC he thought Berkshire shareholders had “seven or more good years coming out of Warren,” but “not very many” out of him, saying, “I have to face reality.” None of the executives was immediately available for interviews.     Berkshire’s Class A shares closed up 1.3 percent at $308,350.00. Its B shares also rose 1.3 percent, to $205.61. Abel, who grew up in Alberta, joined Berkshire Hathaway Energy in 1992. His Iowa-based unit now runs several power companies in the United States, Canada and Britain, as well as natural gas pipelines and solar and wind farms.     Jain, a native of India who joined Berkshire in 1986, runs the reinsurance operations, providing coverage against major catastrophes and unusual risks.     Berkshire’s insurance businesses employed roughly 44,000 people at the end of 2016, while businesses that Abel will oversee employed about 323,000.     Still, insurance remains critical to Berkshire, recently contributing $113 billion of “float,” or premiums collected before claims are paid, for Berkshire to invest. Buffett, the world’s third-richest person according to Forbes magazine, has long said Jain has probably made more money for Berkshire than he has.     “If Jain becomes CEO it would be great, but the complexity of the insurance business requires someone there with more day-to-day supervision,” Rolfe said.     In the CNBC interview, Buffett repeated that Berkshire’s board, whose members include Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates, can install a new chief executive within a day when he steps down, dies or becomes incapacitated.     Abel and Jain became the apparent front runners after Munger singled them out as “world-leading” performers in a 2015 letter to Berkshire shareholders.     Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who are Buffett’s investment deputies, are expected eventually to succeed Buffett as Berkshire’s chief investment officer.     Buffett’s eldest son, Howard, is expected to become Berkshire’s non-executive chairman, to help preserve the company’s culture.

478,BRKa,Bank trio lead $13 billion debt for Blackstone's Thomson Reuters unit bid,"LONDON (Reuters) - Banks are lining up a jumbo leveraged financing of around $13 billion to back U.S. private-equity firm Blackstone Group’s potential acquisition of a 55 percent stake in the Financial and Risk business of Thomson Reuters Corp, banking sources said. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and JP Morgan are expected to lead the debt financing, if the deal goes ahead, with several other banks due to the large size of the underwriting, the banking sources told Loan Pricing Corp. Thomson Reuters said in a statement late on Monday that “it is in advanced discussions with Blackstone regarding a potential partnership in its F&R; business.” The deal values the unit at about $20 billion, consisting of about $7 billion in equity and $13 billion in debt. The financing is expected to be led from New York and comprise leveraged loans and high yield bonds, denominated mainly in dollars, sources said. It is also expected to include euro tranches, they added. A $13 billion financing would give leverage of around 7.5 times, based on the last 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of approximately $1.7 billion for the F&R; unit. Senior leverage of roughly 4.5-5.0 times could give a loan of $8 billion to $9 billion, and junior debt of $4 billion to $5 billion, sources said. Another source familiar with the matter said that leverage was expected to be below 6.0 times. Although the size of the financing is challenging, liquid banks and investors are eager to lend to new buyouts as the strong level of global demand continues to exceed supply. “The market capacity for Europe is about 5 billion euros between loans and bonds and in the U.S. is $10 billion-$15 billion, so if there is a big deal that pushes capacity and the business has revenue globally it would make sense to have euro and dollars in loans and bonds to create a competitive dynamic in order to get best execution,” a senior banker said. It is the largest LBO loan financing since 2013 when ketchup maker HJ Heinz raised a $14.1 billion financing to back its buyout by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital. Thomson Reuters and Blackstone declined to comment. Thomson Reuters’ board is expected to meet on Tuesday to discuss Blackstone’s offer for the F&R; business, which supplies news, data and analytics to banks and investment houses around the world.

Price pressure on Novo Nordisk in the United States is in part due to consolidation among so-called Pharmacy Benefit Managers who administer drug benefits for employers and health plans.

493,BRKa,"UPDATE 1-Berkshire buys Teva, feels IBM blues as Apple becomes top investment","(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Wednesday disclosed a new stake in generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) and said it bought more shares of Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which surpassed Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) as its largest common stock investment. Berkshire also nearly completed its yearlong exit from International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), selling more than 94 percent of what was left from an investment Buffett has admitted was not among his best. In a regulatory filing detailing its U.S.-listed stock holdings as of Dec. 31, Berkshire reported owning about 18.9 million Teva American depositary receipts, worth about $358 million. Teva shares rose more than 10 percent after market hours, reflecting what investors perceive as Berkshire’s seal of approval for the Israeli drugmaker. Last month, Berkshire said it would work with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to create their own healthcare company. Other healthcare stocks fell on that news. “The intimidation, bullying and misery facing the healthcare industry has created bargains,” said Bill Smead, who oversees $2.3 billion, including $130 million in Berkshire stock, at Smead Capital Management Inc in Seattle. Teva and Berkshire declined to comment. Wednesday’s filing details investments made by Buffett and his investment deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, though it does not say who bought what. Combs and Weschler are generally responsible for Berkshire’s smaller investments. Berkshire’s Apple stake grew by about 23 percent since the end of September to roughly 165.3 million shares worth $28 billion. That was just above the reported $27.8 billion stake in Wells Fargo. Berkshire may have funded the Apple purchases by selling roughly $5 billion of IBM stock, reducing that stake to just 2.05 million shares worth about $314 million. Buffett began selling IBM in the first quarter of 2017, and has admitted he did not value the company as highly as when he began buying six years earlier. Berkshire at one time owned roughly 81 million IBM shares, for which it paid about $13.8 billion. Berkshire was close to break-even on IBM when the selling began. Berkshire on Wednesday also reported higher stakes in Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), Monsanto Co MON.N and US Bancorp (USB.N), and lower stakes in American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), General Motors Co (GM.N), France’s Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) and Wells Fargo. On Tuesday, Berkshire agreed to sell more than 43 percent of another big holding, Phillips 66 (PSX.N), back to the oil refiner for $3.3 billion. It plans to remain a long-term shareholder.

497,BRKa,Berkshire's Munger urges regulators to ease up on Wells Fargo,"Feb 14 (Reuters) - Charlie Munger, the longtime business partner of fellow billionaire Warren Buffett, said on Wednesday it is time for regulators to “let up” on Wells Fargo & Co , which was barred this month from asset growth until it addresses a series of problems. Munger spoke at the annual meeting of Daily Journal Corp , the Los Angeles-based newspaper publisher he chairs. CNBC broadcast the meeting on its website. Daily Journal typically draws little attention from investors. But its star attraction was Munger, 94, who has been vice chairman at Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc for four decades. Berkshire owns close to 10 percent of Wells Fargo. “Of course, Wells Fargo had incentive systems that were too strong in the wrong direction, and of course they were too slow in reacting properly to bad news,” but it will “end up better off” for having made those mistakes, Munger said. “I think it’s time for regulators to let up on Wells Fargo. They’ve learned,” he said. Munger spoke less than two weeks after the Federal Reserve blocked the San Francisco-based bank from boosting its asset base until it makes “sufficient improvements.” Wells Fargo has been beset over the last year and a half by revelations that it deceived customers, such as by opening unauthorized accounts and forcing them to take out auto insurance they did not need. Munger also endorsed the recently announced plan by Berkshire, Amazon.com Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co to set up a health care company for their employees to help combat spiraling costs. The current system “runs out of control on the cost side,” causing behavior that is “regrettable” and “evil,” Munger said. “It’s not right to bleed so much money out of our dying people,” Munger said. “I’m all for somebody trying to figure it out.” Buffett has credited Munger with broadening his investment horizons, and seeking out great companies at fair prices rather than emphasizing fair companies that can be bought cheaply. Both executives field shareholder questions at Berkshire’s popular annual meetings, to be held this year on May 5. Munger has acknowledged he does not have many years left at Berkshire. Last month, the company promoted executives Greg Abel and Ajit Jain as vice chairmen. They are widely considered the top candidates to succeed Buffett as chief executive officer.

502,BRKa,"REFILE-GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks climb, shrugging off inflation data; dollar falls","(Refiles to correct day of the week in first paragraph) * Apple, Tencent lead world stocks higher * Dollar weakens to 15-month low vs yen despite rising yields * U.S.-German bond yield gap hits 10-months high By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, Feb 15 (Reuters) - World equity markets climbed on Thursday as investors shrugged off the latest indication of rising U.S. inflation, while the dollar slipped to a 15-month low against the Japanese yen as strong global growth weighed on the U.S. currency. U.S. producer prices accelerated in January, according to a Labor Department report that offered further evidence that inflation pressures were building in the world’s largest economy. The report came on the heels of data on Wednesday showing a broad increase in U.S. consumer prices last month. An index of world stock markets advanced 0.8 percent, while major indices in Europe also rose, bolstered by strong results from heavy hitters such as Airbus, the region’s largest aerospace firm. Investors shrugged off fears of rising inflation and higher interest rates, bidding up shares of Apple Inc after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway made the iPhone maker its top investment. Network gear maker Cisco also boosted indices on upbeat results and forecast. Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management in New York, said he was encouraged by the reaction to the inflation data, which has overshadowed robust earnings, with about 80 percent of companies beating analysts’ estimates. “In the midst of all the nervousness of the past two weeks, we’re winding out a really strong earnings reporting season,” Grohowski said. “There were a lot eyes fixating on the PPI number this morning, it came in a little hot. But much like yesterday, the market’s shaking it off.” MSCI’s all-country world index gained 0.81 percent while the pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading shares in Europe gained 0.36 percent to close provisionally at 1474.26. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 80 points, or 0.32 percent, to 24,973.49. The S&P; 500 gained 10.51 points, or 0.39 percent, to 2,709.14 and the Nasdaq Composite added 51.61 points, or 0.72 percent, to 7,195.23. Rising interest rates need not be a worry as long as the economy is underpinned by good economic growth, he said. “The market’s growing increasingly comfortable that maybe 3 percent on a 10-year Treasury note is OK,” Grohowski said. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 7/32 in price to push yields down to 2.8894 percent. Earlier in the session they had shot up to 2.944 percent. The gap between German and U.S. 10-year borrowing costs reached its widest point since April after the higher-than-expected U.S. inflation data led to a sharp sell-off in U.S. Treasuries earlier in the day. While investors also shed European government bonds after Wednesday’s inflation data, political risks kept a cap on yields. German 10-year government bond yields were a basis point higher at 0.76 percent. The dollar fell across the board. “Forex markets rotate from theme to theme all the time. The theme right now is global growth and strong global growth has historically pushed the dollar lower,” said Greg Anderson, global head of FX strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York. The dollar index fell 0.28 percent, with the euro up 0.15 percent to $1.2467. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.42 percent versus the greenback at 106.56 per dollar. Oil slipped below $64 a barrel as record U.S. production and rising inventories outweighed a weak dollar. U.S. crude output hit a record 10.27 million barrels per day, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday, making it a bigger producer than Saudi Arabia. U.S. crude and gasoline inventories rose last week, U.S. data showed. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell 35 cents to$64.01. U.S. crude rebounded to gain 19 cent to $60.79. Gold was on track for its fourth straight session of gains as the dollar skidded to its lowest in two weeks. Spot gold added 0.2 percent to $1,353.40 an ounce.

503,BRKa,Buffett letter may tout optimism as broader market worries ebb,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett may use part of his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) shareholders, due on Saturday, to renew his optimism about America, at a time economic growth is on the upswing and U.S. stocks sit near record highs despite rising interest rates. His enthusiasm is long-lived. In last year’s letter, he touted the country’s “economic dynamism” and “miraculous” achievements over its 240-year history. The year before, he called newborn American babies “the luckiest crop in history.” And in 2015, he panned the “preachers of pessimism” who “prattle endlessly about America’s problems.” What of 2018? “Does Buffett have the guts to mention that we are in financial euphoria?” said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management Inc in Seattle, a Berkshire investor. The 87-year-old Buffett typically also uses his widely-read, humor-laced letters, which last year ran more than 14,000 words, to assess Berkshire’s performance, praise some managers, and criticize excess on Wall Street and perhaps in Washington. One area of focus may be the effort by Berkshire, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to develop a healthcare company aimed at fighting skyrocketing costs that Buffett calls a “hungry tapeworm” on the economy.

504,BRKa,Buffett letter may tout optimism as broader market worries ebb,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett may use part of his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) shareholders, due on Saturday, to renew his optimism about America, at a time economic growth is on the upswing and U.S. stocks sit near record highs despite rising interest rates. His enthusiasm is long-lived. In last year’s letter, he touted the country’s “economic dynamism” and “miraculous” achievements over its 240-year history. The year before, he called newborn American babies “the luckiest crop in history.” And in 2015, he panned the “preachers of pessimism” who “prattle endlessly about America’s problems.” What of 2018? “Does Buffett have the guts to mention that we are in financial euphoria?” said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management Inc in Seattle, a Berkshire investor. The 87-year-old Buffett typically also uses his widely-read, humor-laced letters, which last year ran more than 14,000 words, to assess Berkshire’s performance, praise some managers, and criticize excess on Wall Street and perhaps in Washington. One area of focus may be the effort by Berkshire, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to develop a healthcare company aimed at fighting skyrocketing costs that Buffett calls a “hungry tapeworm” on the economy.  Berkshire will on Saturday also release year-end results expected to include a big jump in book value, a key gauge of growth at his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate.

505,BRKa,Billionaire investor Warren Buffett to retire from Kraft Heinz board,"(Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co said on Friday billionaire investor Warren Buffett has decided to retire from the company’s board following the end of his term in April to reduce travel commitments. H.J. Heinz Co, backed by Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and Brazil’s private equity firm 3G Capital, acquired Kraft Foods Group in 2015 to create one of the biggest food and beverage companies in the world. Berkshire Hathaway is Kraft Heinz’s biggest shareholder with 26.7 percent stake as of Dec. 31, according to Thomson Reuters data. Last week, the maker of Velveeta cheese and Heinz ketchup reported disappointing fourth-quarter results, a sign of continued pressure on processed food makers as more Americans opt for healthier meals. In the last few years, Buffett, 87, has shed many of his non-Berkshire responsibilities.  Last month, he gave two top executives Ajit Jain and Gregory Abel greater oversight of Berkshire’s operating businesses, cementing their status as the front runners to succeed Buffett atop the conglomerate. Kraft said it plans to nominate Alexandre Van Damme, a board member of Anheuser-Busch Inbev and Restaurant Brands International, to stand for election to Buffett’s place in its 2018 annual stockholder meeting. Abel and Tracy Cool, chief executive of Berkshire’s unit, Pampered Chef, are the other Berkshire representatives on Kraft’s board. Kraft’s shares were down 1.4 percent in extended trading on Friday.

506,BRKa,Berkshire boosts liability estimate on AIG reinsurance contract,"(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), the conglomerate run by billionaire Warren Buffett, on Saturday disclosed a $1.8 billion increase in estimated claim liabilities under a big reinsurance contract with American International Group Inc (AIG.N). In its annual report, Berkshire said the increase, to $18.2 billion, was made in the fourth quarter, and was based on higher-than-expected loss payments reported by AIG. Berkshire also boosted a related deferred charge asset by $1.7 billion, and estimated its year-end net liability under the contract was $10.7 billion. The January 2017 contract called for Berkshire’s National Indemnity Co to take on many of the long-term risks in AIG’s property and casualty portfolio, sometimes known as “long-tail” exposure, in exchange for $10.2 billion upfront. National Indemnity agreed to take on 80 percent of net losses in excess of the first $25 billion, with a maximum liability of $20 billion. The contract reduced potential risks for New York-based AIG, and some analysts said soon after it was announced that the pricing terms appeared fair.     At the same time, the $10.2 billion payment boosted Berkshire’s insurance “float,” which reflects premiums received before claims are paid, and gave Buffett more money to invest.

508,BRKa,"WRAPUP 3-With $116 billion cash, Buffett says Berkshire needs 'huge' deals","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday lamented his inability to find big companies to buy and said his goal is to make “one or more huge acquisitions” of non-insurance businesses to bolster results at his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc. In his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett said finding things to buy at a “sensible purchase price” has become a challenge and is a major reason Berkshire is awash with $116 billion of low-yielding cash and government bonds. Buffett said a “purchasing frenzy” binge by deal-hungry chief executives employing cheap debt has made that task  difficult. Berkshire typically pays all cash for acquisitions. “Our smiles will broaden when we have redeployed Berkshire’s excess funds into more productive assets,” Buffett wrote. “Berkshire’s goal is to substantially increase the earnings of its non-insurance group. For that to happen, we will need to make one or more huge acquisitions.” The letter was considerably shorter than in recent years, a little over 8,000 words compared with more than 14,000 last year, and did not discuss major Berkshire stock holdings such as Apple Inc and Wells Fargo & Co. Buffett often invests in stocks when he cannot find whole companies to buy. It was also short on faulting excesses of Wall Street and Washington, and said nothing about Berkshire’s plan to create a healthcare company with Amazon.com Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. At age 87, “he doesn’t want to make any enemies,” said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, a Berkshire investor. Berkshire also posted a record $44.94 billion annual profit, though $29.1 billion stemmed from the slashing of the U.S. corporate tax rate, which reduced the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s deferred tax liabilities. Book value per share, measuring assets minus liabilities, rose 23 percent in 2017. It has been more than two years since Buffett made a major purchase, the $32.1 billion takeover of aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, and his advancing age gives him less time to find more of the “elephants” he prefers. But he has given himself and longtime Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 94, more freedom to focus on investing and allocating capital. Neither has signaled any intention of stepping down soon, though Berkshire last month named two additional vice chairmen who could eventually succeed Buffett as chief executive. Gregory Abel, who had run Berkshire Hathaway Energy, is now overseeing Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Dairy Queen ice cream, all of which employ 330,000 people, while insurance specialist Ajit Jain oversee the Geico auto insurer and other insurance businesses, employing 47,000. “Berkshire’s blood flows through their veins,” Buffett wrote. While the Wells Fargo investment has struggled in recent months because of scandals over how it treats customers, Apple has performed better. Buffett revealed in his letter that Berkshire was sitting at year end on a $7.25 billion paper profit on what has become a 3.3 percent stake in the iPhone maker, worth $28.2 billion. Some Berkshire stock investments are made by deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who Buffett said together manage about $25 billion, up from $21 billion a year ago. Buffett also warned long-term investors including pension funds, college endowments and “savings-minded individuals” that even with U.S. stock prices near record highs, it would be a “terrible mistake” to assume bonds are safer. “Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk,” he wrote. Fourth-quarter net income quintupled to $32.55 billion, or $19,790 per Class A share, from $6.29 billion, or $3,823 per share, a year earlier. Operating profit, which Buffett considers a better gauge of performance, fell more than analysts expected in the fourth quarter, and slid 18 percent for the year to $14.46 billion. Full-year results suffered from Berkshire’s first full-year insurance underwriting loss since 2002, hurt by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and wildfires in California. Even so, insurance float, or premiums collected before claims are paid, and which give Buffett more money to invest, rose 25 percent last year, to $114.5 billion.

509,BRKa,Buffett says 'terrible mistake' for long-term investors to be in bonds,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire Warren Buffett prodded ordinary investors on Saturday to stay invested in U.S. stocks, ignoring price swings, guidance from people with fancy credentials and the temptation to load up on bonds. Buffett said it is a “terrible mistake” for investors with long-term horizons - among them, pension funds, college and endowments and savings-minded individuals - to measure their investment “risk” by their portfolio’s ratio of bonds to stocks. The long-time bull on U.S. companies and the economy issued his latest letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders on Saturday. Treasury yields have been rising since the start of the year, stemming from brewing inflationary pressures and massive bond supply to help fund U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax overhaul.  Higher rates have kept U.S. equity markets under selling pressure, as investors worry borrowing costs could hurt companies’ profitability. Earlier this month, stocks suffered their first 10 percent pullback since early 2016. High-grade bonds, he said, can increase the risk of an investment portfolio as inflation eats away at the return. “There is simply no telling how far stocks can fall in a short period,” Buffett said. “As an investor’s investment horizon lengthens, however, a diversified portfolio of U.S. equities becomes progressively less risky than bonds, assuming that the stocks are purchased at a sensible multiple of earnings relative to then-prevailing interest rates.” For its part, Buffett said Berkshire is sitting on $116 billion of low-yielding cash and government bonds - whose average maturity was 88 days as of year-end 2017. They are struggling to put that money to work because of a “purchasing frenzy” by deal-hungry chief executives employing cheap debt that pushed “prices for decent, but far from spectacular, businesses” to “an all-time high.” [nL2N1QE0A4] Known to fans as “the Oracle of Omaha,” Buffett, 87, has suggested U.S. stocks are probably the best bet over time, encouraging people to make easy choices and stick with them, eschewing high-fee fund managers, for instance. In 2014, Buffett said he plans to put 90 percent of the money he leaves to his wife, Astrid, when he dies into an S&P; 500 index fund, and 10 percent in government bonds. Buffett in 2007 bet a founder of the asset management company Protégé Partners LLC $1 million that a Vanguard S&P; 500 index fund would outperform several groups of hedge funds over a decade. He won that bet last year. The proceeds were given to Buffett’s charity of choice, Girls Inc of Omaha. Yet his own unease with market prices comes as other investors have struggled with the same problem after a near-decade long bull market. “Though markets are generally rational, they occasionally do crazy things,” said Buffett, adding that investors need “an ability to both disregard mob fears or enthusiasms and to focus on a few simple fundamentals” even if makes them “look foolish.” “In America, equity investors have the wind at their back,” he said.

510,BRKa,Buffett says Berkshire can handle $400 billion mega-catastrophe,"(Reuters) - A giant hurricane, earthquake or other conflagration inflicting unprecedented, catastrophic damage is likely at some point to strike the United States. Warren Buffett says: Bring it on. In his annual letter to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Buffett said “no company comes close” to his conglomerate in its ability to financially withstand even a mega-catastrophe that causes $400 billion of insurance losses. Buffett said the odds of such a catastrophe in any year is just 2 percent, but that Berkshire would lose only about $12 billion, a sum more than offset by annual profits from its non-insurance businesses. “Concurrently, much - indeed, perhaps most - of the p/c world would be out of business,” he wrote, referring to property and casualty insurers. “Our unparalleled financial strength explains why other p/c insurers come to Berkshire – and only Berkshire – when they, themselves, need to purchase huge reinsurance coverages for large payments they may have to make in the far future.” Berkshire entered insurance in 1967 when it paid $8.6 million for reinsurer National Indemnity Co and an affiliate. The sector has since been the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s main driver of growth, even as Buffett expanded into railroads, chemicals, energy, industrial products, newspapers, candy and ice cream, underwear and other businesses. Berkshire’s many insurance operations also include the Geico auto insurer and General Re reinsurer. Longtime insurance executive Ajit Jain has been in charge of overseeing coverage against giant or unusual risks. In January, Berkshire named Jain a vice chairman overseeing insurance operations, cementing his status as a possible successor to Buffett as Berkshire’s chief executive. Last year was difficult for Berkshire in insurance underwriting, where it lost $3.24 billion before taxes and $2.22 billion after taxes, its first full-year loss since 2002. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, as well as California wildfires, were key culprits, and the $3 billion pretax cost for the hurricanes disappointed some analysts because of their size. Even Geico lost $310 million before taxes from underwriting, despite boosting premiums by 16 percent and policies-in-force by 9 percent. Its underwriting loss was $188 million in the fourth quarter.  Berkshire had made money from underwriting even in 2005, when Hurricane Katrina struck the U.S. Gulf Coast. That storm at the time caused $41.1 billion of U.S. insured losses, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Nonetheless, insurance helps fund Berkshire’s growth by providing Buffett with float, or premiums collected before claims are paid, that he can invest. Float totaled $114.5 billion at the end of December, and Buffett said it will “probably increase slowly for at least a few years.” As he often does in his letters, Buffett praised his managers for keeping insurance growth on track, calling their work “conservative and careful” despite the occasional hiccup. “What counts are brains and capital,” he wrote. “The managers of our various insurance companies supply the brains and Berkshire provides the capital.” ",2242018,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-buffett-insurance/buffett-says-berkshire-can-handle-400-billion-mega-catastrophe-idUSL2N1QE0BO
511,BRKa,"Highlights: Buffett craves acquisitions, flags bond risks in Berkshire letter","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Below is a selection of comments from Warren Buffett’s latest letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. shareholders, released on Saturday: “Our aversion to leverage has dampened our returns over the years. But Charlie (Munger) and I sleep well. Both of us believe it is insane to risk what you have and need in order to obtain what you don’t need.  Berkshire’s goal is to substantially increase the earnings of its non-insurance group. For that to happen, we will need to make one or more huge acquisitions. We certainly have the resources to do so.  At year-end Berkshire held $116.0 billion in cash and U.S. Treasury Bills (whose average maturity was 88 days), up from $86.4 billion at yearend 2016. This extraordinary liquidity earns only a pittance and is far beyond the level Charlie and I wish Berkshire to have.”  “Charlie and I never will operate Berkshire in a manner that depends on the kindness of strangers – or even that of friends who may be facing liquidity problems of their own. During the 2008-2009 crisis, we liked having Treasury Bills – loads of Treasury Bills – that protected us from having to rely on funding sources such as bank lines or commercial paper. We have intentionally constructed Berkshire in a manner that will allow it to comfortably withstand economic discontinuities, including such extremes as extended market closures. Berkshire’s insurance managers are conservative and careful underwriters, who operate in a culture that has long prioritized those qualities. That disciplined behavior has produced underwriting profits in most years, and in such instances, our cost of float was less than zero. In effect, we got paid then for holding the huge sums tallied in the earlier table. I have warned you, however, that we have been fortunate in recent years and that the catastrophe-light period the industry was experiencing was not a new norm. Last September drove home that point, as three significant hurricanes hit Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.” “I want to quickly acknowledge that in any upcoming day, week or even year, stocks will be riskier – far riskier – than short-term U.S. bonds. As an investor’s investment horizon lengthens, however, a diversified portfolio of U.S. equities becomes progressively less risky than bonds, assuming that the stocks are purchased at a sensible multiple of earnings relative to then-prevailing interest rates. It is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons – among them, pension funds, college endowments and savings-minded individuals – to measure their investment “risk” by their portfolio’s ratio of bonds to stocks. Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk.” “I’ve saved the best for last. Early in 2018, Berkshire’s board elected Ajit Jain and Greg Abel as directors of Berkshire and also designated each as Vice Chairman.  Ajit is now responsible for insurance operations, and Greg oversees the rest of our businesses. Charlie and I will focus on investments and capital allocation. You and I are lucky to have Ajit and Greg working for us. Each has been with Berkshire for decades, and Berkshire’s blood flows through their veins. The character of each man matches his talents. And that says it all.” ",2242018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-buffett-highlights/highlights-buffett-craves-acquisitions-flags-bond-risks-in-berkshire-letter-idUSKCN1G80PG
512,BRKa,Trump tax cut fuels record profit for Buffett's Berkshire,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Saturday reported a record quarterly and annual profit, fueled by a big cut in the U.S. corporate income tax rate championed by President Donald Trump. Fourth-quarter net income increased roughly fivefold to $32.55 billion, or $19,790 per Class A share, from $6.29 billion, or $3,823 per share, a year earlier. Quarterly operating profit for the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate fell 24 percent to $3.34 billion from $4.38 billion. Berkshire attributed roughly $29.11 billion of its net income to the reduction of the corporate tax rate, to 21 percent from 35 percent, that Trump signed into law in December. Many U.S. companies’ reported results have been skewed by the law’s impact. “Buffett has been quick to say that he thinks that the tax policy changes were going to help Berkshire and be positive overall,” said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, a Berkshire shareholder. “It is a bit ironic his candidate would not have any interest in this whatsoever.”  Buffett supported Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. “Buffett doesn’t dwell very long on the politics,” Smead said. Book value per Class A share, which reflects assets minus liabilities and which Buffett considers a good yardstick for Berkshire’s intrinsic worth, also benefited from the tax cut, rising 13 percent in the fourth quarter to $211,750. For all of 2017, Berkshire’s net income rose 87 percent to $44.94 billion. Operating profit, however, fell 18 percent to $14.46 billion, hurt by a rare loss from insurance underwriting. Berkshire’s Class A shares closed at $304,020.01 on Friday, and its Class B shares closed at $202.76.

For that to happen, we will need to make one or more huge acquisitions.” The letter was considerably shorter than in recent years, a little over 8,000 words compared with more than 14,000 last year, and did not discuss major Berkshire stock holdings such as Apple Inc and Wells Fargo & Co. Buffett often invests in stocks when he cannot find whole companies to buy. It was also short on faulting excesses of Wall Street and Washington, and said nothing about Berkshire’s plan to create a healthcare company with Amazon.com Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. At age 87, “he doesn’t want to make any enemies,” said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, a Berkshire investor. Berkshire also posted a record $44.94 billion annual profit, though $29.1 billion stemmed from the slashing of the U.S. corporate tax rate, which reduced the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s deferred tax liabilities. Book value per share, measuring assets minus liabilities, rose 23 percent in 2017. It has been more than two years since Buffett made a major purchase, the $32.1 billion takeover of aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, and his advancing age gives him less time to find more of the “elephants” he prefers. But he has given himself and longtime Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 94, more freedom to focus on investing and allocating capital. Neither has signaled any intention of stepping down soon, though Berkshire last month named two additional vice chairmen who could eventually succeed Buffett as chief executive. Gregory Abel, who had run Berkshire Hathaway Energy, is now overseeing Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Dairy Queen ice cream, all of which employ 330,000 people, while insurance specialist Ajit Jain oversee the Geico auto insurer and other insurance businesses, employing 47,000. “Berkshire’s blood flows through their veins,” Buffett wrote. While the Wells Fargo investment has struggled in recent months because of scandals over how it treats customers, Apple has performed better. Buffett revealed in his letter that Berkshire was sitting at year end on a $7.25 billion paper profit on what has become a 3.3 percent stake in the iPhone maker, worth $28.2 billion. Some Berkshire stock investments are made by deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who Buffett said together manage about $25 billion, up from $21 billion a year ago. Buffett also warned long-term investors including pension funds, college endowments and “savings-minded individuals” that even with U.S. stock prices near record highs, it would be a “terrible mistake” to assume bonds are safer. “Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk,” he wrote. Fourth-quarter net income quintupled to $32.55 billion, or $19,790 per Class A share, from $6.29 billion, or $3,823 per share, a year earlier. Operating profit, which Buffett considers a better gauge of performance, fell more than analysts expected in the fourth quarter, and slid 18 percent for the year to $14.46 billion. Full-year results suffered from Berkshire’s first full-year insurance underwriting loss since 2002, hurt by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and wildfires in California. Even so, insurance float, or premiums collected before claims are paid, and which give Buffett more money to invest, rose 25 percent last year, to $114.5 billion.

518,BRKa,Buffett sets big goals for CEO of Bezos-Dimon health venture,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Monday said the healthcare company being set up by Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) will within a year have a new chief executive officer, and set an aggressive goal to cut costs. Speaking on CNBC television, Buffett said “we can’t afford to make a mistake” in finding the right CEO to help combat spiraling healthcare costs that now account for close to 18 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, or $10,000 per person. Buffett said it would not be difficult to “shave” off 3 or 4 percentage points, contrasting the situation to 1960, when he said healthcare costs accounted for just 5 percent of GDP, or $170 per person. “We are at a huge competitive disadvantage in American business” relative to other industrialized countries because of the costs, Buffett said. “The question is whether we can come up with something better. I’m hopeful, but don’t expect any miracles.” Berkshire, Amazon and JPMorgan last month said they would start a healthcare venture for their workers. While few details were provided, shares of several insurers and pharmacy benefits managers fell on the news because investors worried how the venture might disrupt the industry. Buffett said that in starting the venture, “we have the perfect partnership” with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Todd Combs, an investment manager for Buffett and a JPMorgan, will spearhead Berkshire’s involvement. The interview occurred two days after Buffett released his shorter-than-usual annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, which had little discussion about the company’s investments. One is Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the third-largest U.S. bank, which was surprisingly ordered this month by the Federal Reserve to curb asset growth while it tries to rebound from scandals over how it treated customers. Buffett, whose Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate owns nearly 10 percent of Wells Fargo, on Monday said “I have confidence in Tim Sloan,” the bank’s CEO. He likened the situation to 1991, when Buffett was installed as chairman of Salomon Brothers Inc amid a bond trading scandal that nearly landed that company in bankruptcy. “Digging your way out of it takes time,” Buffett said.  “He’s got a lot to clean up.” Buffett also discussed other means to deploy Berkshire’s $116 billion cash stake, after saying in the letter he desired one or more “huge” acquisitions of non-insurance businesses. He said he would be “more inclined” to buy back stock than pay dividends, and might raise the repurchase threshold from 1.2 times book value. Berkshire’s stock traded at roughly 1.44 times book value based on Friday’s market close. “I am fairly confident we will find ways to deploy” excess cash, Buffett said. “The best chance to deploy money is when things are going down.” Also helping Berkshire will be the recent cut in the U.S. corporate income tax rate, which gave Berkshire a one-time $29.11 billion net income boost by reducing its potential tax bill on stocks it owns. The cut is a “huge tailwind” for U.S. companies and is “really good for Berkshire,” Buffett said. Buffett also said that while stocks remained a better bet than bonds over the long-term, it remained “crazy” for ordinary investors to use margin, or borrowed cash, to load up on stocks.  He said investors might get a “euphoric surge” if they double their money in stocks, but would not be “happier.” ",2262018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-buffett-cnbc/buffett-sets-big-goals-for-ceo-of-bezos-dimon-health-venture-idUSKCN1GA1CX

521,BRKa,UPDATE 9-Health insurer Cigna to buy Express Scripts for about $52 bln,"(Reuters) - U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp (CI.N) struck a $52-billion deal to buy pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O) on Thursday, looking for new ways to hold onto their profits as the industry faces greater scrutiny for rising healthcare costs. The pharmacy benefits business, which tries to negotiate down the price of prescription medicines for large employers, has drawn fire from the Trump administration and Congress, who have questioned whether those discounts are really being passed on to consumers. Cigna’s deal follows close on the heels of a rival $69-billion merger between CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) and health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N), announced in December. Together, the transactions would represent a massive consolidation of the market for managing employees’ prescription drug benefits, prompting some  experts to question whether they will be approved. “Employers are growing increasingly frustrated with the cost of prescription drugs and a lack of transparency into the economics of how this works,” said Jim Winkler, senior vice president for health at benefits manager and broker Aon, part of Aon Plc (AON.N). Cigna and Express Scripts say the combination will lower costs for corporate clients by giving them more coordination between medical care and pharmacy benefits, particularly for pricey specialty drugs. “Our employer clients will be delighted with that,” Cigna Chief Executive David Cordani said in an interview. It could help Cigna more closely manage how costly drugs are prescribed and delivered to patients, and fend off potential competition from new players such as Amazon.com.  All told, the companies project $600 million in annual savings.     Express Scripts shares were up 8 percent at $79.29 on Thursday afternoon, but they were trading 12.6 percent below the current value of the bid, suggesting that some investors see difficulties closing the deal. Cigna shares fell 11.5 percent to $171.86. PBMs administer prescription drug programs for health insurers, self-insured companies and government agencies, negotiating deals with drug manufacturers, working with pharmacies and processing claims.   The largest U.S. health insurer, UnitedHealth Group (UNH.N), in 2015 expanded its in-house pharmacy benefits business, OptumRx, with the $13-billion purchase of Catamaran. CVS, Express Scripts and UnitedHealth control more than two-thirds of the PBM market, a top U.S. health official said on Wednesday.   Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) in October said it would expand its own pharmacy benefits business, and hired CVS to do so.    Antitrust experts said the Trump administration would need to review how both deals between Cigna and Express and between CVS and Aetna would affect the U.S. market, already the world’s most expensive healthcare system.  “Having two simultaneous deals significantly raises the risk,” said David Balto, an antitrust lawyer with expertise in the health industry. “There’s a significant risk that both deals get challenged.” In 2016, the Obama administration scuttled two major health insurer mergers - Anthem Inc’s purchase of Cigna and Aetna’s purchase of rival Humana - largely on concerns the consolidation would raise costs for consumers. Today’s deals between an insurer and PBM represents a so-called vertical integration of players within the health industry. But it could limit the ability of large employers to choose who manages both prescription drug benefits and medical coverage for their employees. “This type of merger would create a market-straddling giant, with new profit-maximizing incentives ... ultimately leading to higher costs and potentially poorer coverage and care for consumers,” said George Slover, senior policy counsel for Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports. Most national companies with more than 20,000 employees use different companies to provide prescription drug benefits and medical coverage. Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth said during a conference call with analysts that he does not expect to lose other health insurers who use Express Scripts as their PBM because of the deal. Cigna’s offer consists of $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 in shares of the combined company for each Express Scripts share, amounting to $96.03 per share. That represents a premium of nearly 31 percent to Express Scripts’ Wednesday closing price. Cigna will also assume about $15 billion in Express Scripts’ debt, the company said. The combined company will be led by current Cigna CEO Cordani. Wentworth will stay on as president of the company’s Express Scripts unit. After the deal closes, expected by the end of the year, Cigna shareholders will own about 64 percent of the combined company and Express Scripts shareholders the rest. Cigna intends to fund the cash portion of the deal through a combination of cash on hand, Express Scripts debt and new debt issuance. The combined company is expected to have debt of about $41.1 billion. The insurer said it obtained fully committed debt financing from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd for the deal. Morgan Stanley was the financial adviser to Cigna. Centerview Partners and Lazard were financial advisers to Express Scripts.

522,BRKa,Buffett's Dairy Queen sues W.B. Mason over 'Blizzard',"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s favorite ice cream company has kicked up a legal storm over the “Blizzard.” American Dairy Queen, whose Blizzard has long been one of its most popular products, sued W.B. Mason Co in federal court this week to stop the office supplies distributor from selling bottled spring water also bearing the Blizzard name. Dairy Queen’s Blizzard contains soft-serve ice cream that can be blended with fruit, nuts, M&Ms;, Oreos and other mix-ins. W.B. Mason has fought back, and on Thursday filed its own federal lawsuit seeking a declaration that it did not infringe any trademark belonging to Dairy Queen, owned since 1998 by Buffett’s conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N). The litigation is not Dairy Queen’s first over the Blizzard name, and follows its 2010 settlement of a lawsuit involving a Southern California frozen yogurt company, Yogubliz. Dairy Queen began using the Blizzard name in 1946, and has five Blizzard trademarks dating back to 1952. Its current Blizzard has been for sale since 1985. W.B. Mason, known for the slogan “Who But W.B. Mason,” has since 2010 sold Blizzard water, in sizes from 8 ounces to 5 gallons, and has used the name to sell copy paper as early as 2003. It attracted Dairy Queen’s attention last April after submitting trademark applications for Blizzard water. In its March 12 complaint, Dairy Queen said W.B. Mason’s conduct threatens “irreparable injury” and has caused a “likelihood of confusion” because many of Dairy Queen’s 4,500 U.S. locations sell bottled water. The Edina, Minnesota-based company, which has more than 6,700 locations worldwide, is seeking an injunction against W.B. Mason, plus profits from water sales. W.B. Mason, based in Brockton, Massachusetts, said it has “no interest” in creating confusion, and has created none. The companies have had “a long period of what we call co-existence,” its lawyer, Jason Kravitz, a partner at Nixon Peabody in Boston, said in an interview. “There has not been to our knowledge a single instance of any consumer being confused by W.B. Mason’s sale and promotion of its spring water.”  Dairy Queen does not discuss pending litigation, spokesman Dean Peters said in an email. Buffett sometimes visits Dairy Queen in his Omaha, Nebraska, hometown. Known for eating habits that would give some doctors fits, the 87-year-old billionaire told Yahoo Finance in 2016 he usually orders a small sundae for the ice cream and an extra large sundae for the topping, and combines them. The cases are American Dairy Queen Corp v. W.B. Mason Co, U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota, No. 18-00693; and W.B. Mason Co v American Dairy Queen Corp, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 18-10488.

523,BRKa,Berkshire says median employee makes over half Buffett's pay,"(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Friday said its median employee last year made a little over half the $100,000 salary that Chairman Warren Buffett was awarded for running the conglomerate that made him the world’s third-richest person. In a regulatory filing, Berkshire said Buffett’s salary, unchanged for more than a quarter century, was about 1.87 times the $53,510 median pay, based on a sample of about two-thirds of Berkshire’s 377,000 employees across some 90 businesses such as Geico insurance, the BNSF railroad and Dairy Queen ice cream. The 1.87 pay multiplier contrasts with the three-figure multipliers that some chiefs of big U.S. companies receive. But nearly all of their fortunes, and those of Berkshire employees, are far smaller than Buffett’s, whose $88.8 billion net worth trails only those of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) Chief Executive Jeff Bezos and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) co-founder Bill Gates, according to Forbes magazine. Berkshire is working with Amazon and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to develop a company that lowers healthcare costs. Gates is a Berkshire director and longtime friend of Buffett. According to Friday’s filing, Berkshire in 2017 also provided Buffett with $375,000 of home and personal security services, while Buffett, 87, reimbursed Berkshire $50,000 for personal expenses. Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Manger, 94, drew his usual $100,000 salary in 2017, while Chief Financial Officer Marc Hamburg’s pay rose 46 percent to $2.29 million, the filing said. Pay was not disclosed for Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, the newly installed vice chairmen respectively overseeing Berkshire’s non-insurance and insurance operations, but it will continue to be determined by Buffett. Berkshire also recommended the rejection at its May 5 annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska of proposals by two shareholders. Marcia Sage wants Berkshire to issue a report on its methane emissions, while Freeda Cathcart wants Berkshire to encourage more operating businesses to issue sustainability reports. Berkshire called Sage’s proposal imprudent, and said Cathcart’s was “inconsistent with Berkshire’s culture” of letting managers do their jobs without Buffett’s interference. Buffett controls 32 percent of Berkshire’s voting power. He also owns 17.2 percent of its stock, despite having donated more than $27.6 billion since 2006.

526,BRKa,Buffett's Berkshire charts distinctive course in USG sale talks,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) promises its shareholders that it “will not engage in unfriendly takeovers.” But when it comes to cashing out of an investment, Berkshire showed a willingness on Monday to do business with a bidder that will not take no for answer. As building products company USG Corp (USG.N) was rejecting a $42 per share, or $5.9 billion, takeover approach from Germany’s Gebr Knauf KG, Berkshire disclosed it had offered to sell Knauf its 30.8 percent stake in USG for the same per share price, or more. The proposal by Berkshire, USG’s largest shareholder, to Knauf, its second largest, was unusual, structured as a six-month option contingent on Knauf buying the rest of USG. Knauf would pay a $2 per share upfront fee, or $86.8 million, which Berkshire would keep if the six months expired without a merger. The option’s exercise price would equal Knauf’s eventual bid for USG, less $2 per share. Knauf said it was considering the proposal.  “Berkshire has so much leverage, because of its USG stake, that it will extract whatever additional value it can get,” said Michael Yoshikami, who oversees $2.3 billion at Destination Wealth Management in Walnut Creek, California and owns Berkshire stock. “The message here is Berkshire is not desperate to make a deal with Knauf,” he added. Buffett’s office was not immediately available for comment. Buffett is known for using Berkshire’s size and reputation to win friendly terms for shareholders. That is particularly important now, as the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate labors under $116 billion of cash and equivalents. During the 2008 global financial crisis, Buffett became a “lender of last resort” to such companies as USG, Dow Chemical Co, General Electric Co (GE.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N). Berkshire has owned USG since 2000, held on through its bankruptcy, and in 2008 joined Canada’s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd (FFH.TO) in buying USG convertible debt yielding 10 percent. By 2014, Berkshire had swapped its USG debt into stock. Buffett said at Berkshire’s annual meeting last year that USG was “not one of my great ideas,” but “no disaster.” Selling USG for the right price would be consistent with Buffett’s preference to own whole companies rather than stocks.

Gebr Knauf disclosed on Monday it had offered to buy the maker of gypsum wallboards earlier this month for $42 per share, a premium of 25 percent to the stock’s Friday closing, valuing the company at about $6 billion. In response to the offer, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), had offered an option to sell its 31 percent stake in the company as long as Knauf’s offered at least $42 a share for USG. Berkshire also proposed an option purchase price of $2 per share. The option provides a sweetener for Buffett to shed a profitable investment that originated at the height of the housing crisis in late 2008, when Berkshire and Canada’s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd (FFH.TO) bought $400 million of USG’s debt. The $2 per share cost of the option would provide Berkshire about $86.8 million upfront, based on its 43.39 million share USG stake. Berkshire would keep that money even if Knauf is unable to buy USG. “This (USG’s rejection) is ultimately a negotiating tactic and Knauf will increase its purchase price to at least about $44 per share,” Instinet analyst Michael Wood wrote in a client note. “While we expected neither USG’s board of directors nor top shareholders to be eager to sell at the proposed valuation... Berkshire’s option proposal implies it felt the $42 offer was a suitable starting point in the price negotiation,” Wood wrote. USG’s stock rose as much as about 20 percent to $40.20 on Monday. They have fallen about 13 percent this year.  “Knauf’s opportunistically timed proposal is wholly inadequate,” USG’s non-executive chairman Steven Leer said. The company reported a 6.8 percent decline in its 2017 operating profit, hurt by higher costs of raw materials such as gypsum and steel. At the same time, it also benefited from robust demand for housing in the United States. Morgan Stanley is the financial adviser to Knauf. J.P. Morgan Securities and Goldman Sachs and Co were the financial advisers to USG.

531,BRKa,China's BYD sees Q1 profit falling sharply amid subsidy cuts,"SHANGHAI, March 27 (Reuters) - Chinese automaker BYD Co Ltd , backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, said on Tuesday its first-quarter net profit would likely fall sharply amid cuts to subsidies for new-energy vehicles. BYD, which has invested heavily in battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles amid China’s push for greener transport, estimated net profit for the first three months would fall between 75.2-91.8 percent versus a year earlier. That would put profits for the quarter between 50 million yuan ($7.96 million) and 150 million yuan versus 605.8 million yuan in the same period in 2017. The Shenzhen-based firm said its annual net profit fell 19.5 percent to 4.07 billion yuan last year, roughly in line with preliminary figures release last month. In 2016, the firm’s net profit had jumped almost 80 percent. China’s central government wants the country to be a world leader in new-energy vehicles (NEVs) and related technologies, but has been looking to phase out financial subsidies that have been behind the rapid growth of the sector. Domestic and international industry executives have called for continued policy support from Beijing to help maintain growth in the world’s largest NEV market, where broader auto sales growth is slowing down. BYD, which also has businesses in electric batteries and other transport services, should see earnings growth pick up in 2018, with analysts polled by Reuters predicting a 50 percent jump in net profit this year.

532,BRKa,"China's BYD warns profit to plunge on electric car subsidy cuts, shares tumble","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s BYD Co Ltd (1211.HK)(002594.SZ), backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), warned subsidy cuts for new-energy vehicles could slash its quarterly profit by as much as 90 percent, driving its shares down almost 10 percent. The squeeze on BYD’s profits underscores the challenge carmakers are facing in the world’s largest auto market, which is moving toward pure electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles with strict quotas set to come into effect next year. BYD has invested heavily in battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles amid Beijing’s push for greener transport. “(As we are) affected by reduction in new energy vehicles (NEVs) subsidies, the profitability of the business, especially for electric buses, has declined substantially so as to bring great pressure to the group’s overall profit,” BYD said. The company expects its first-quarter net profit to slump 75.2-91.8 percent from a year ago due to the subsidy cuts. That would put profits for the three months to March between 50 million yuan ($7.96 million) and 150 million yuan, versus 605.8 million yuan a year ago. In February, China’s finance ministry cut subsidies for lower-range NEV cars and for some buses, but raised them for vehicles with higher performance. BYD’s shares in Hong Kong and Shenzhen both fell as much as 10 percent to multi-month lows in intraday trade on Wednesday. “Even though people are still buying NEVs as subsidies fall, BYD’s plight speaks to a tough future for electric cars,” said Yale Zhang, head of consultancy Automotive Foresight. BYD’s net profit in 2017 fell 19.5 percent to 4.07 billion yuan, roughly in line with preliminary figures release last month. In 2016, the firm’s net profit had jumped almost 80 percent. China’s central government wants the country to be a world leader in NEVs and related technologies, but has been looking to phase out financial subsidies that have been behind the rapid growth of the sector. BYD said a quota system giving carmakers a “credit score” based on their NEV output and performance, set to come into effect next year, would support larger players while “eliminating weaker players in the industry”. Domestic and international industry executives have called for continued policy support from Beijing to help maintain growth in the world’s largest NEV market, where broader auto sales growth is slowing down. BYD, which is looking to diversify its businesses into electric batteries and other transport services, should see earnings growth pick up in 2018, with analysts polled by Reuters predicting a 50 percent jump in net profit this year.

[nL2N1RI0U7] JPMorgan, Amazon and Berkshire announced in January that they would form a venture that would use technology to try to cut healthcare costs for their employees, and potentially open the venture to other companies, but have provided few details since.

The group does not yet have a CEO and has not begun operations, Dimon said during a subsequent interview on Yahoo Finance on Thursday. While the group’s combined employees are fewer than 1 million people and a small slice of the more than 160 million people in employer-based healthcare plans in the United States, Amazon’s strength in using data and technology to disrupt businesses has healthcare investors watching closely. Shares in healthcare companies that act as middlemen, like insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, fell when the news was first announced that the three companies would work together. On Thursday, the S&P; 500 health index, which includes drug distributors, insurers and pharmacies, was up 0.4 percent. The letter included six points of focus for the company, including aligning payments with better medical outcomes for patients instead of simply paying for each medical service, which is how the current system is built. The company will aim to give more control to employees by improving access to their own healthcare data and increasing telemedicine, Dimon wrote. He also pointed to better programs to decrease rates of obesity and smoking, which contribute to chronic disease like cancer, stroke and heart disease. Dimon said it would also study the money spent on waste, administration and fraud and determine why there is misuse of specialty medicines and pharmaceuticals.

536,BRKa,Buffett's Berkshire will oppose USG board nominees after Knauf bid,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) plans to vote against four board nominees proposed by USG Corp (USG.N), giving a boost to a $5.9 billion takeover bid by German’s Gebr Knauf AG that the building products company had rejected. Berkshire, which is USG’s largest shareholder with a 31 percent stake, announced its intention on Thursday, two days after Knauf called on USG shareholders to pressure that company to enter merger talks by withholding support for its director slate. Knauf owns about 10.5 percent of USG. “Berkshire’s present intention is to vote against the four directors proposed by management,” Buffett’s assistant, Debbie Bosanek, said in an email. A USG spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. Knauf’s takeover bid values USG at $42 per share. USG shares closed up 2.4 percent at $40.77 on Thursday. They closed at $33.51 on March 23, before Knauf’s bid became public. Buffett has called his more than 17-year USG investment disappointing but “no disaster.” A USG takeover could add to the $116 billion of cash and equivalents his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate has to invest. “You don’t normally see this kind of stuff from Berkshire,” said Morningstar Inc analyst Greggory Warren. “It’s not like they need the capital.” Berkshire owns more than 90 businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Geico car insurance. Buffett has long preferred owning whole companies to individual stocks. Earlier on Thursday, USG sent an open shareholder letter calling Knauf’s opposition to its director slate “a misguided attempt” to pressure the board into accepting a takeover “substantially below our intrinsic value.” Berkshire’s offer to sell its roughly 43.4 million USG shares essentially created a pricing floor for any sale. It was structured as a six-month option contingent on Knauf buying the rest of USG, with Knauf paying $2 per share upfront that Berkshire would keep if no merger occurred in that period. Berkshire has owned USG since 2000, the year before asbestos liabilities helped push the Chicago-based company into bankruptcy for five years. In 2008, after the housing market imploded, Berkshire bought $300 million of USG convertible debt, which was later swapped into stock. USG’s board has 10 members but is “staggered,” meaning only four seats are being filled at its May 9 annual meeting. Chief Executive Jennifer Scanlon and Chairman Steven Leer are not among the directors up for election. USG also has a “poison pill” defense to help thwart unwelcome takeovers.

539,BRKa,Wells Fargo CEO's pay details spark pushback by some employees,"WASHINGTON/BOSTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s (WFC.N) disclosure of how its chief executive’s pay compares to the rest of its workforce has drawn criticism from some company employees ahead of the scandal-plagued bank’s annual shareholder meeting.  More than a dozen employees made posts criticizing pay details the bank released in March, according to comments on an internal communications website seen by Reuters. Separately, a worker advocacy group said it plans to raise pay issues on Tuesday at the shareholder meeting in Des Moines, Iowa.  Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan earned $17.6 million for 2017, according to its proxy filing, an estimated 291 times the median of the annual total compensation of all the bank’s workers. It is easy for Sloan to be optimistic about the future of the bank considering he is collecting a raise “on an already enormous salary,” wrote Vernes Rasidkadic, who left a job at Wells Fargo in Omaha, Nebraska, shortly after posting comments in mid-March.  Rasidkadic told Reuters he stands by his posted comments. After several days, Wells Fargo closed the notice board to new posts, writing that some comments do not comply with company policies, according to the internal discussion. A company spokeswoman confirmed the discussion had been closed. When asked about the postings on Friday, a Wells Fargo official said the bank values constructive feedback. “We will continue to invite team member participation and encourage dialogue,” said spokeswoman Diana Rodriguez. The bank in 2016 admitted employees had opened potentially millions of sham accounts for customers in order to hit sales targets, which led to the departure of its previous CEO. Sloan did not collect a cash bonus in 2016 and in 2017, although his total compensation for 2017 was 35 percent higher than for 2016. Wells Fargo’s CEO pay ratio was higher than Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) but lower than JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), according to data U.S. public companies must report starting this year. Those lenders have different business mixes and Wells Fargo skews more than some toward lower-paid retail workers.  Wells Fargo raised its minimum hourly wage to $15 an hour in March, an 11-percent hike for about 36,000 workers, it announced in December on the heels of the U.S. tax code overhaul.  The Committee for Better Banks, a group that includes labor unions and consumer and community advocacy groups, is calling for the bank to raise that wage again to $20.  A representative for the group said Alex Ross, a Wells Fargo employee and activist with Better Banks, plans to comment on pay at the shareholder meeting and say that a raise would in turn help the bank’s mission of rebuilding community trust following the scandal.      On Friday, the bank said it agreed to pay U.S. regulators $1 billion to settle probes into customer abuses in auto lending and mortgages. A review of bank pay by executive compensation data firm Equilar shows Sloan earned roughly 20 percent less than Bank of America and Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) paid their leaders for 2017. Among top Wells Fargo shareholders, representatives for Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) did not respond to questions on how it planned to vote its roughly 9-percent stake in the bank. A representative for the second-largest investor, Vanguard Group Inc, with a roughly 7-percent stake, declined to comment on its votes at the bank. Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis recommend investors cast non-binding advisory votes in favor of the compensation of Sloan and other Wells Fargo executives.

540,BRKa,Barclays and Paypal announce tie-up as banks mull big tech threat,"LONDON (Reuters) - British bank Barclays (BARC.L) and digital payments firm PayPal (PYPL.O) have announced a partnership that will see them explore ways to combine their services for customers, Barclays said on Thursday. The pair aim to allow Barclays customers in the United States and Britain to use their PayPal accounts on the bank’s online and mobile phone-based platforms while Barclays products will be used in PayPal accounts. The move comes amid mounting concerns from bank industry executives that big technology companies such as Amazon (AMZN.O) and Apple (AAPL.O) in the U.S. or China’s Alibaba (BABA.K) could come to dominate the $1.8 trillion global payments industry. With their ever-expanding customer bases and nimbler platforms, the tech companies could supplant the banks as the face of an industry that accounts for 34 percent of all banking revenues, according to consultancy McKinsey. The announcement from Barclays shows one route traditional lenders are taking, to try and collaborate with large technology companies rather than compete. Amazon and JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) are exploring offering a checking account together in the U.S., according to media reports in March, while those two firms plus Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) are mulling a collaboration on healthcare payments. Barclays and PayPal made clear that they are still discussing possible ways the companies’ services could be combined. “By joining forces, we can make it much easier for people to manage their money and payments,” Barclays UK Chief Executive Ashok Vaswani said in the bank’s statement. Tech firms face their own obstacles in trying to break into the financial sector, from stringent regulations on any activity resembling deposit-taking to customers trusting banks more than new tech firms to safeguard their money. The announcement comes as Barclays prepares to report its first quarter earnings on Thursday, with investors focused on whether it can improve profits to match its U.S. rivals.

541,BRKa,Proxy advisory firms back Knauf's $5.9 bln bid for USG,"(Reuters) - Proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) and Glass Lewis & Co have sided with German producer of building materials Gebr Knauf KG in its $5.9 billion bid for U.S. gypsum manufacturer USG Corp (USG.N), Knauf said on Monday. The firms have issued reports recommending that USG shareholders vote against all four of USG’s director nominees at USG’s annual shareholder meeting on May 9, to send a message that the company must engage in negotiations. USG is under pressure to enter into discussions with Knauf after rejecting a $42 per share offer in March. USG shares ended trading on Monday at $40.23.  USG has argued Knauf’s bid undervalued the company despite USG’s largest shareholder, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), offering to sell its 31 percent stake at that price. “Progressive engagement between the parties has stalled due to the USG board’s response, namely its refusal to either make a clear counteroffer (one that will not intensify shareholder skepticism) or structure and initiate appropriate limited diligence,” Knauf said in a statement, citing ISS’s report. To be sure, even a resounding vote against the company would not be in any way binding for USG, which has a staggered board, meaning only four of its 10 directors face a shareholder vote this year. It also has a “poison pill” defense available, preventing Knauf from launching a hostile bid.

542,BRKa,Buffett-backed USG to open sale talks with Germany's Knauf,"(Reuters) - U.S. building products company USG Corp (USG.N) on Tuesday said it agreed to open talks to sell itself to Germany’s Gebr Knauf AG, a sale that could benefit Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), USG’s largest shareholder. Shares of USG rose to their highest since August 2007. USG had in March rejected a $5.9 billion takeover proposal by Knauf, its second-largest shareholder, that valued the wallboard maker at $42 per share. But USG changed its mind after Berkshire, which holds a roughly 31 percent stake, and two major proxy advisory firms recommended voting against four USG board nominees at the Chicago-based company’s May 9 annual meeting.  Merger talks may not succeed. USG signaled it might hold out for more than $42 per share and that Knauf “will see value in excess” of its original bid. “Given USG’s having publicly endorsed in a recent investor presentation that it views its intrinsic value at $45 to $52 per share, I don’t think they’re that far apart from getting a deal over the finish line,” said Garik Shmois, a senior analyst at Longbow Research, who rates USG “neutral.” Knauf, which recently held a 10.5 percent USG stake, said it was encouraged by USG’s change of heart, although its original all-cash offer still reflected “full and fair” value. “We are pleased that the board has acknowledged shareholders want to see a transaction,” Knauf said. Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In afternoon trading, USG shares were up $1.72, or 4.3 percent, at $41.95 on the New York Stock Exchange.

543,BRKa,UPDATE 3-Buffett-backed USG to open sale talks with Germany's Knauf,"(Reuters) - U.S. building products company USG Corp (USG.N) on Tuesday said it agreed to open talks to sell itself to Germany’s Gebr Knauf AG, a sale that could benefit Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), USG’s largest shareholder. Shares of USG rose to their highest since August 2007. USG had in March rejected a $5.9 billion takeover proposal by Knauf, its second-largest shareholder, that valued the wallboard maker at $42 per share. But USG changed its mind after Berkshire, which holds a roughly 31 percent stake, and two major proxy advisory firms recommended voting against four USG board nominees at the Chicago-based company’s May 9 annual meeting.  Merger talks may not succeed. USG signaled it might hold out for more than $42 per share and that Knauf “will see value in excess” of its original bid. “Given USG’s having publicly endorsed in a recent investor presentation that it views its intrinsic value at $45 to $52 per share, I don’t think they’re that far apart from getting a deal over the finish line,” said Garik Shmois, a senior analyst at Longbow Research, who rates USG “neutral.” Knauf, which recently held a 10.5 percent USG stake, said it was encouraged by USG’s change of heart, although its original all-cash offer still reflected “full and fair” value. “We are pleased that the board has acknowledged shareholders want to see a transaction,” Knauf said. Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In afternoon trading, USG shares were up $1.72, or 4.3 percent, at $41.95 on the New York Stock Exchange. Berkshire has owned a USG stake since 2000, held on as asbestos liabilities helped push USG into a five-year bankruptcy, and provided a $300 million lifeline in 2008 after the housing market imploded.

544,BRKa,USG agrees to enter sale talks to Knauf,"May 1 (Reuters) - The building products company USG Corp on Tuesday said it has agreed to open talks to possibly sell itself to Gebr Knauf AG after previously rejecting an unsolicited $5.9 billion takeover bid from the German company. USG changed its mind after Berkshire Hathaway Inc, its largest shareholder with a 31 percent stake, signaled it planned to vote against four of its board nominees.

545,BRKa,Buffett draws them in even as Berkshire comes up short,"(Reuters) - He thinks of himself as a teacher, and to many he is an icon. But to Wall Street, Warren Buffett is something quite different. A disappointment. Tens of thousands of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) shareholders and fans may think otherwise as they flock to Omaha, Nebraska, this weekend to see Buffett, 87, and his longtime partner and fellow billionaire Charlie Munger, 94. The weekend will celebrate their long-term success running a conglomerate, now with 90-some businesses overseen on a daily basis by two potential Buffett successors, newly-installed Vice Chairmen Greg Abel and Ajit Jain. But recent results, relative to what analysts were counting on, were of a sort that might make chief executives at other companies hang their heads. Berkshire’s operating profit, excluding investments and derivatives, has fallen short of Wall Street forecasts for eight consecutive quarters, while its cash stake swelled to $116 billion because Buffett could not find enough worth buying. In contrast, just 21 percent of Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX companies typically miss forecasts in any given quarter, while 64 percent beat forecasts. Berkshire has a chance to break its streak on Saturday morning when it is scheduled to report first-quarter results. “Obviously, the quarterly results matter, but I care year-to-year about what they’re doing,” said Paul Lountzis, founder of Lountzis Asset Management LLC in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, who has been to more than 20 meetings and is attending this weekend. “Though you may be upset with all the cash they have, if there is a challenge across the world, or liquidity dries up, he’s going to step in and take advantage,” he added, referring to Buffett. Predicting results can be hard because Berkshire’s tentacles spread far. Its products and services include car insurance (Geico), mobile homes (Clayton), wind power (Berkshire Hathaway Energy), cowboy boots (Justin Brands), chocolate (See’s), helium balloon inflators (Western Enterprises) and electronic sow feeding systems (perhaps unsurprisingly, PigTek). “Berkshire Hathaway is a challenging company to analyze,” and “does not manage its results to meet Street expectations,” Barclays analyst Jay Gelb wrote last week. Insurance underwriting has dragged on recent results, and Berkshire last year paid out billions of dollars for hurricane losses. But a tailwind from an improving U.S. economy boosted shipments on the BNSF railroad, and bolstered Berkshire’s building materials and consumer businesses.  Gelb expects operating profit to rise 45 percent in 2018. That could help Berkshire’s stock price, which closed on Tuesday about 10 percent below its peak on Jan. 29. Questions about Berkshire will likely comprise a majority of the roughly 60 questions that Buffett and Munger will field over five hours at Saturday’s annual shareholder meeting. “There’s always something to learn,” said Brandon Taylor, managing partner of Taylor Hoffman Wealth Management in Richmond, Virginia, attending his sixth meeting this year. “Knowledge compounds over time, and the more I expose myself to investors who are better than me, the better off I will be.” Berkshire sent out slightly more tickets to this year’s extravaganza than in 2015, when an estimated 42,000 celebrated Buffett’s 50th year at the helm. A couple of million may watch Buffett and Munger online this year via Yahoo Finance. As usual there will also be events across Omaha, including investing conferences and shareholder shopping at Berkshire-owned businesses. At the jeweler Borsheim’s, for example, silver pens bearing Buffett’s signature fetch $14, while a 1.93-carat argyle pink diamond can be yours for the bargain price of $1,046,750 (normally $1.57 million). But the meeting remains the highlight. It may give Buffett and Munger a chance to address progress on Berkshire’s joint venture with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to lower employee healthcare costs, or the scandals hurting the stock price and reputation of Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), one of Berkshire’s biggest investments. Buffett and Munger will likely also get questions about matters outside their comfort zones, such as bitcoin, or perhaps dysfunction in Washington. While Buffett is a Democrat and Munger a Republican, both are equal-opportunity critics of shortsightedness and stupidity. The meeting is “a rejuvenation of all the investment values and principles that Warren and Charlie impart,” Lountzis said.

547,BRKa,UPDATE 3-Apple hits record high after Buffett's Berkshire increases stake,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc’s stock hit an all-time high on Friday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc disclosed it bought an additional 75 million shares of the iPhone maker in the first three months of the year. Buffett’s increased stake, which was confirmed by a representative of the billionaire investor, pushed Apple’s shares up as much as 4.2 percent to $184.25, taking the company’s market value to about $906 billion. Apple declined to comment on Friday. “If you look at Apple, I think it earns almost twice as much as the second most profitable company in the United States,” Buffett told CNBC, which first reported the news on Thursday.  Friday’s rise was the stock’s second significant gain this week after the Cupertino, California-based company surprised Wall Street on Tuesday with resilient iPhone sales and quarterly results that topped expectations. Daniel Morgan, an investor in Apple, said it is “not surprising to see Buffet take a big position” in the company. “He is an old ‘Graham and Dodd’ value investor,” said Morgan, who is a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, which holds 270,415 shares in Apple.     Buffett’s commitment to Apple over the past two years has surprised many, given his historical aversion to companies associated with the technology sector. “I think Apple was much more of a consumer products business,” Buffett had said last May in a Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholders meeting.  Berkshire’s initial investment in Apple was small, suggesting it was made by one of Buffett’s investment deputies. But with the latest stake purchase, it has grown to a massive 240.3 million shares worth $42.5 billion. In February, Berkshire said its Apple stake grew by about 23 percent since the end of September to roughly 165.3 million shares. Recently, Berkshire almost sold out its entire investment in IBM Corp and at the same time bought more Apple shares. “They are two different types of decisions. And I was wrong on the first one (IBM), and we’ll find out whether I’m right or wrong on the second (Apple),” Buffett had said a year ago. There may also be another reason for the investment: Berkshire’s cash pile of $116 billion. The investment company has not made a major acquisition for more than two years and Buffett had said in his latest annual letter that he wanted to acquire one or more “huge” non-insurance companies to reduce Berkshire’s cash and equivalents. Buying Apple shares partly accomplishes that, even though Buffett would prefer to buy whole companies. Berkshire typically discloses its largest common stock holdings and percentage stakes in its quarterly and annual reports.  The report for the first quarter is set for release on Saturday morning, just before Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett’s hometown. Up to Friday’s close, Apple stock had risen 9.8 percent since Berkshire disclosed on Feb.14 that it had raised its stake in the company. The shares closed up 3.9 percent at $183.83 on Friday.

549,BRKa,Clayton Homes mimics Buffett approach as it grows,"OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s manufactured housing unit Clayton Homes is borrowing the playbook of Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s longtime chairman as it boosts its bet on a growing market for traditional site-built homes. Clayton entered the field in 2015, and has grown in larger markets such as Atlanta, Charlotte, Denver and Nashville, and smaller markets including Salt Lake City and Birmingham, Alabama, marketing vice president Carl Hill said on Thursday.  “We’ve looked for businesses that have really similar cultural values that happen to be in strong and growing housing markets,” he said, ahead of Berkshire’s annual meeting on Saturday. “Business owners, when they come on board, have a very strong interest in remaining part of the businesses and continuing to run operations, really very similar to the way Berkshire Hathaway has grown through its subsidiaries.” Site-built homes are still a small part of Clayton’s business, with much of its $765 million pretax profit last year coming from its $13.7 billion mortgage portfolio. Clayton also dominates the manufactured home market, where profit margins are greater, and where it commands a 49 percent share, Buffett said in February. Such homes are often bought by people with low credit scores, low incomes, and financial profiles that can come undone by divorce or death. Clayton is trying to move past reports three years ago in the Seattle Times claiming it exploited black, Latino and Native American borrowers into unaffordable subprime loans. The Maryville, Tennessee-based company has denied those allegations and Buffett has defended Clayton repeatedly, lauding what he called its “best-in-class” management group and culture. Clayton stands to benefit from a bill in Congress that would exempt builders of manufactured homes from lending rules applying elsewhere in the housing market, and let them refer prospective buyers to affiliated lenders. The U.S. Senate in March passed the White House-backed legislation 67-31, with 16 Democrats voting in favor, and sent it to the House of Representatives. Supporters believe the bill could spur homebuying and lending, while critics say it could restrict competition and strain lower-income homebuyers through higher borrowing costs. “We’re particularly interested in supporting legislation that makes for a more open and competitive marketplace,” Hill said. With U.S. homeownership at a five-decade low, Clayton is targeting homebuyers with a $200,000 budget but who want land -  a combination admittedly unattainable in parts of the country. “There is a deficit of available inventory,” Hill said. “A lot of people are having to move into smaller, older homes to get into that price point.”     ",5042018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-buffett-clayton/clayton-homes-mimics-buffett-approach-as-it-grows-idUSKBN1I51ZG

554,BRKa,Buffett targets CEO for Berkshire-Amazon-JPMorgan healthcare venture soon,"OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday said he hoped a chief executive would be found within a couple of months for the healthcare company being set up by Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Amazon.com Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to lower patient costs. Speaking at the annual shareholder meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc conglomerate, Buffett maintained that healthcare is a “tapeworm” on American businesses, hurting their ability to compete with rivals in other countries. While there is no guarantee the venture between Amazon.com, Berkshire and JPMorgan, which collectively employ more than 1 million people, will succeed, Buffett said it is well positioned to try. “I think we’ll have a CEO within a couple of months,” Buffett said. “We want our employees to get better medical services at lower cost ... The resistance will be unbelievable, and if we fail, at least we tried.” Amazon.com’s reputation as a disruptor prompted investors in January, when the venture was announced, to sell shares of companies that might be hurt. These included drugmakers, health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) such as CVS Health Corp and Express Scripts Holding Co. Buffett said the goal was to challenge the entire healthcare industry, not individual segments. Yet Charlie Munger, Buffett’s longtime business partner and a Berkshire vice chairman, suggested that Democrats could take over Congress after November’s elections and push for a national healthcare system financed by a single payer. Munger predicted that such a change would harm drug benefit managers. “I suspect that eventually, when Democrats control both houses of Congress and the White House, that we will get single-payer medical care, and I don’t think it’ll be much more friendly than any of the PBMs,” Munger said.

558,BRKa,Buffett owns 5 percent of Apple. He'd like to own more,"OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Warren Buffett said he would be happy if his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc owned more than 5 percent of Apple Inc’s stock, including if the iPhone maker bought back more of its shares. Buffett made his assessment before tens of thousands of Berkshire shareholders attending the conglomerate’s annual meeting on Saturday in Omaha, Nebraska. It came two days after Buffett revealed having bought 75 million additional Apple shares, and four days after Apple said it may buy back $100 billion of stock. “I’m delighted to see them repurchasing shares,” Buffett told Berkshire shareholders at the conglomerate’s annual meeting. “I love the idea of having our 5 percent, or whatever it is, maybe grow to 6 or 7 percent without our laying out a dime. But you have to have a very, very special product, which has an enormously widespread ecosystem, and the product is extremely sticky.” Apple’s share price hit a record high after Buffett revealed having boosted Berkshire’s already large stake in the Cupertino, California-based company to roughly 240 million shares, now worth some $44 billion.  While Buffett “very much” approves of Apple repurchasing shares, he and Munger expressed skepticism that Apple could find meaningful acquisitions on which to spend cash. “The reason companies are buying their stocks is that they are smart enough to know it’s better for them than anything else,” Munger said. He said he and Buffett do not approve of all repurchase strategies.     Buffett’s initial commitment to Apple surprised many given his usual aversion to companies in the technology sector, but the billionaire views Apple more as a consumer products company. The investment also helps Buffett deploy Berkshire’s cash and equivalents while he looks for his first major acquisition since paying $32.1 billion for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp in January 2016. Even after the Apple investment, Berkshire’s holdings of cash and equivalents was $108.6 billion, the company said on Saturday. Buffett made his comments in response to a shareholder question posted by CNBC journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin. “$100 billion is a lot of money,” the question concluded. “I used to think so,” Buffett joked, prompting laughter and applause.

559,BRKa,UPDATE 1-Buffett targets CEO for Berkshire-Amazon-JPMorgan healthcare venture soon,"(Adds Munger comment on pharmacy benefit managers) By Jonathan Stempel OMAHA, Neb., May 5 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday said he hoped a chief executive would be found within a couple of months for the healthcare company being set up by Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Amazon.com Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to lower patient costs. Speaking at the annual shareholder meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc conglomerate, Buffett maintained that healthcare is a “tapeworm” on American businesses, hurting their ability to compete with rivals in other countries. While there is no guarantee the venture between Amazon.com, Berkshire and JPMorgan, which collectively employ more than 1 million people, will succeed, Buffett said it is well positioned to try. “I think we’ll have a CEO within a couple of months,” Buffett said. “We want our employees to get better medical services at lower cost ... The resistance will be unbelievable, and if we fail, at least we tried.” Amazon.com’s reputation as a disruptor prompted investors in January, when the venture was announced, to sell shares of companies that might be hurt. These included drugmakers, health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) such as CVS Health Corp and Express Scripts Holding Co. Buffett said the goal was to challenge the entire healthcare industry, not individual segments. Yet Charlie Munger, Buffett’s longtime business partner and a Berkshire vice chairman, suggested that Democrats could take over Congress after November’s elections and push for a national healthcare system financed by a single payer. Munger predicted that such a change would harm drug benefit managers. “I suspect that eventually, when Democrats control both houses of Congress and the White House, that we will get single-payer medical care, and I don’t think it’ll be much more friendly than any of the PBMs,” Munger said. Buffett, famed for his love of junk food, has said spiraling healthcare costs are responsible for 18 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, up from 5 percent in 1960, and he wants to slash a few percentage points off. “We are attacking an industry moat,” Buffett said.

561,BRKa,Buffett's Berkshire swings to rare loss but performs better,"OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Warren Buffett lost money but had a pretty good quarter. Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Saturday reported an unusual quarterly net loss, the result of an accounting change that Buffett had warned would produce “wild” but in his view meaningless swings in results. But Berkshire also ended a long stretch of disappointing operating performance, posting record operating profit as insurance rebounded from a difficult quarter while economic growth bolstered results in railroad, industrial and consumer businesses. Berkshire posted a first-quarter net loss of $1.14 billion, or $692 per Class A share, compared with net income of $4.06 billion, or $2,469 per share, a year earlier. The accounting change required Berkshire to report $6.2 billion of unrealized losses in its marketable stock portfolio, which totaled $170.5 billion at year end, regardless of whether it planned to sell those stocks. Two of Berkshire’s biggest stock investments, Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), had tough first quarters, falling 13.6 percent and 5.3 percent, respectively. Buffett has called the new accounting rule a “nightmare” that would produce “truly wild and capricious swings” in bottom-line results that could, depending on their direction, unnecessarily scare or embolden investors. “It really is not representative of what’s going on in the business at all,” Buffett told shareholders at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. Berkshire said its operating profit, which Buffett considers a better performance measure, rose 49 percent to $5.29 billion, or about $3,215 per Class A share, from $3.56 billion, or $2,163 per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected operating profit of about $3,116 per Class A share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Operating profit had previously fallen for five straight quarters, and missed Wall Street forecasts for eight straight. Book value, which measures assets minus liabilities, also took a hit from falling stock prices, falling 0.3 percent to $211,184 per Class A share, even though Buffett boosted his stake in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) by $12.5 billion in the quarter. Some analysts have said the stock losses have weighed on Berkshire shares, which are 10 percent below their record highs set on Jan. 29. In Friday trading, the Class A shares closed at$292,600, and the Class B shares at $195.64. Buffett, 87, and Vice Chairman Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 94, are answering five hours of questions from shareholders, journalists and analysts at the annual meeting. Despite the Apple purchase, Berkshire ended the quarter with $108.6 billion of cash and equivalents, giving Buffett ammunition to make one or more “huge” non-insurance acquisitions he has said he wants. Berkshire’s insurance businesses, which had been struggled with losses from hurricanes and other events, posted a $407 million underwriting profit, compared with a year earlier $267 million loss. Buffett said the Geico car insurer had “quite a good-sized turnaround in profitability.” Pre-tax underwriting gains nearly quadrupled, as it sold more policies despite having raised rates, while the rate of policyholder losses fell. “The trends look pretty good,” Tony Nicely, Geico’s chief executive, told Reuters on Friday. “The number of claims are down somewhat. Yet the costs keep going up.” An improving economy led to higher business volume at the BNSF railroad, which saw profit rise 37 percent to $1.15 billion. Pretax profit at industrial businesses such as Precision Castparts rose 32 percent, while lower taxes helped boost profit at the Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit by 22 percent.

563,BRKa,Breakingviews - Robo-Buffett no longer such a ridiculous notion," OMAHA (Reuters Breakingviews) - The 40,000 shareholders crowding Omaha’s CenturyLink Center for Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting Saturday didn’t come to hear about machine learning or smart beta. They’re here for Chairman Warren Buffett’s plain-speak – and maybe some See’s Candies peanut brittle. That’s probably fine for now. But the idea of a robo-version of the Oracle of Omaha is no longer a ridiculous notion. As finance and Silicon Valley converge, Buffett’s old-world approach, honed over half a century, seems ever more anachronistic. Giant fund manager Pimco is poaching data engineers. Lazard Asset Management is pushing into “quantamental” strategies combining human stock-pickers with machines. Two Sigma, a $50 billion fund manager with around 1,400 staff, mostly data nerds, is now one of the world’s biggest quantitative funds. Buffett doesn’t even have a computer in his office. Buffett’s dogged avoidance of that which he claims not to understand has worked to his advantage, mostly. He missed the excesses of the dotcom bubble – though his biggest holding is now Apple, and he increased his stake in the first quarter. And there’s no sign yet the armies of data scientists joining the investment industry will deliver. The Eurekahedge AI index – tracking funds that use artificial intelligence technologies – has made a 9.5 percent annualized return over the past year, compared with 8.7 percent for hedge funds overall. Berkshire Hathaway did twice as well. Over three years, Buffett and the bots delivered the same 10 percent annual return. The rise of the machines could eat away at one Buffett advantage: the ability to avoid irrational decisions. Being rational, objective and dispassionate – picking wisely but selling only sparingly – is one of the pillars of Buffett’s investing style. His partner Charlie Munger expounds a complex system of human behavioral models, with the idea that if you can avoid the automatic biases and reactions of most people, you can outperform them. Buffett cautions against “getting excited at the wrong time.” That’s consistent with the premise of AI-based investing. Berkshire has other durable defensive “moats.” Its insurance business provides both long-term funding through premiums and the ability to raise low-cost debt to leverage up Berkshire’s equity investments. The other is pulling power – Buffett’s clout allows him to cut deals other investors can’t, as he did in buying convertible shares in Goldman Sachs – or more recently, nudging chipboard company USG into talking with its unsolicited suitor Knauf. Moreover, he charges no fees to investors and has a tiny staff, with no human resources department. Computers would also struggle to capture Buffett’s understanding of what makes people tick - a quality much on display in Omaha. Entertaining investors with barbecues, LeBron James and Katy Perry videos, and discounted cowboy boots, appeals to what Munger refers to as “the automatic tendency of humans to reciprocate favors.” It remains to be seen whether that inclination persists once Buffett, 87, and Munger, 94, retire. Even so, loyalty is something an algorithm hasn’t yet worked out how to capture.",5052018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bershire-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-robo-buffett-no-longer-such-a-ridiculous-notion-idUSKBN1I60TA
564,BRKa,"Apple and Buffett saw value, and acted","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) was not the only one to leap on a chance to buy its stock at a fat discount last quarter as Warren Buffett stepped in to scoop up an additional 75 million shares for Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) at the same time. Between them - the two biggest players in the iPhone maker’s shares - they bought nearly one of every 10 Apple shares traded during the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters calculations. But the discount window did not stay open long, with Apple’s stock back at a record high above $183 on Friday after trading in the mid-$150s for part of the first quarter.  The recovery in the share prices makes it less opportune for Apple’s corporate treasury to execute purchases as it proceeds with an additional $100 billion of buybacks in an effort to further winnow down its mountain of cash. Apple bought more than $23 billion of its own shares in the first three months of the year at an average price of $171.48, the company said this week. A Buffett representative on Friday confirmed Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in Apple by 75 million shares, for which the company looks to have paid between $12 billion and $13 billion, based on the stock’s trading range during the period. Funds from the repatriation of Apple’s $252 billion overseas cash hoard arrived at an convenient time for traders working on behalf of Apple. The Cupertino, California, company’s massive share purchase in the March quarter coincided with a 10 percent slump in the S&P; 500 between Jan 26 and Feb 8.  That drop raised fears across Wall Street that a nine-year bull market was ending and made it easier for big players amassing shares in a company to find willing sellers.  Apple shares fell even more than the broader market, tumbling over 13 percent from their record high close. But while the S&P; 500 has remained in correction territory, Apple shares quickly recovered, and it seems the company and Berkshire were there to help.  Buffett, a billionaire bargain hunter, increased his company’s stake to 240.3 million shares worth $42.5 billion during first quarter. At its low in February, the stock was available for as little as $150, an 18 percent discount to its current price. On more than a third of the trading days during the March quarter, Apple’s stock traded below its volume weighted average price, or VWAP, for the prior 60 days.  On Feb 8, when it closed at $155.15, the low for the quarter, it was at a nearly 10 percent discount from its 60-day average VWAP. The stock had not been available at such a large discount to its prevailing average since May 2016, which happens to be when Buffett bought his first-ever shares of Apple. At its close of $183.83 on Friday, however, Apple now stands at a premium of nearly 7 percent to its 60-day VWAP of $172.11. Prior to last quarter, Apple’s largest-ever quarterly repurchase occurred in early 2014, a year after it initiated its first $210 billion buyback program. The stock traded at a discount to its 60-day VWAP through much of the quarter, and Apple spent $18 billion to buy up its own shares, according to filings.

566,BRKa,"In Omaha, preparing for change at Berkshire Hathaway"," OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - The first question Warren Buffett was asked at Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s annual meeting on Saturday was whether he was “semi-retired,” having given four lieutenants oversight over the company’s operating businesses and some investments. “I’ve been semi-retired for decades,” the billionaire joked. Many in the audience of tens of thousands laughed. “Warren is very good at doing nothing,” Vice Chairman Charlie Munger later retorted. More laughter. How long Buffett and Munger stay on is more serious. More Berkshire Hathaway news: Chinese investors flock to Buffett Slideshow: Inside Buffett's Berkshire bash They have built Berkshire into a $481 billion conglomerate whose dozens of businesses sweep across the American economy. Running it well, and doing a convincing job of it, would challenge many of even the best executives. Buffett is 87. Munger is 94. And that means change is likely soon, not just for Berkshire, but also for the weekend of events in Omaha, Nebraska, celebrating their accomplishments and values. “Warren and Charlie remain the principal show, but there is so much more to this culture,” said Lawrence Cunningham, a law professor who has written books about Berkshire. “This is not a one-man show or a two-man show.” Buffett and Munger are still responsible for major Berkshire capital allocation and investment decisions. But in January, Buffett tapped longtime executives Greg Abel and Ajit Jain to oversee Berkshire’s business units, making them front-runners to succeed him as chief executive. He has also for several years given Todd Combs and Ted Weschler some Berkshire money to invest. They could become chief investment officer. But none has Buffett’s and Munger’s public profile, magnetism, or history of investing success. Buffett and Munger took the rare step on Saturday to assure shareholders about Berkshire’s future under new leaders. “The reputation belongs to Berkshire now,” Buffett said. Munger elaborated: “I think we’ve started something here that will work well enough that it will last. And one of the reasons it will last is, it’s not that damn easy to duplicate.” When they’re gone, shareholders expect Omaha’s largest annual event other than the College World Series of baseball to feel different, with fewer people coming for the meeting and the shopping discounts from Berkshire businesses. “Crowds will be smaller,” said Richard Callahan, a banker at Bank of the West in Omaha. They’re big now.

Across town, Borsheims Fine Jewelry, a Berkshire unit, hosted its Friday night cocktail reception. Ten thousand people were expected. Karen Goracke, Borsheims’ chief executive, said she wouldn’t expect Berkshire itself to run much differently under Abel or Jain, whom she has known for a decade. “People feel like they got to know Warren and Charlie personally,” Goracke said. “They feel very connected because they’ve had years to build that up. I expect there will be some transition. That’s just human nature.” David Brown, president of the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce, expressed optimism the weekend won’t lose its “Road to Mecca” feel. “We’ve all seen these iconic leaders in the past, and as soon as they left the companies weren’t what they purported to be,” he said. “We’re not going to see that with Berkshire.” Many shareholders believe they themselves can sustain the weekend. “The set of values Warren has built within us will carry on for much, much, much, much longer than any one individual,” said William Robertson, a firefighter and forester from Switzerland. “A lot of people here seem to be a familiar face,” said Peter Ringsmuth, who owns a publishing firm in Lincoln, Nebraska. “There’s some kind of bond.” That’s reflected in the nocturnal fortitude of shareholders who line up for the meeting long before doors open at 7 a.m. Saturday. Robertson said he queued up at 11:30 p.m. Friday.

568,BRKa,"RPT-Apple and Buffett saw value, and acted","(Repeats with no changes) By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, May 6 (Reuters) - Apple Inc was not the only one to leap on a chance to buy its stock at a fat discount last quarter as Warren Buffett stepped in to scoop up an additional 75 million shares for Berkshire Hathaway at the same time. Between them - the two biggest players in the iPhone maker’s shares - they bought nearly one of every 10 Apple shares traded during the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters calculations. But the discount window did not stay open long, with Apple’s stock back at a record high above $183 on Friday after trading in the mid-$150s for part of the first quarter. The recovery in the share prices makes it less opportune for Apple’s corporate treasury to execute purchases as it proceeds with an additional $100 billion of buybacks in an effort to further winnow down its mountain of cash. Apple bought more than $23 billion of its own shares in the first three months of the year at an average price of $171.48, the company said this week. A Buffett representative on Friday confirmed Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in Apple by 75 million shares, for which the company looks to have paid between $12 billion and $13 billion, based on the stock’s trading range during the period. Funds from the repatriation of Apple’s $252 billion overseas cash hoard arrived at an convenient time for traders working on behalf of Apple. The Cupertino, California, company’s massive share purchase in the March quarter coincided with a 10 percent slump in the S&P; 500 between Jan 26 and Feb 8. That drop raised fears across Wall Street that a nine-year bull market was ending and made it easier for big players amassing shares in a company to find willing sellers. Apple shares fell even more than the broader market, tumbling over 13 percent from their record high close. But while the S&P; 500 has remained in correction territory, Apple shares quickly recovered, and it seems the company and Berkshire were there to help. Buffett, a billionaire bargain hunter, increased his company’s stake to 240.3 million shares worth $42.5 billion during first quarter. At its low in February, the stock was available for as little as $150, an 18 percent discount to its current price. On more than a third of the trading days during the March quarter, Apple’s stock traded below its volume weighted average price, or VWAP, for the prior 60 days. On Feb 8, when it closed at $155.15, the low for the quarter, it was at a nearly 10 percent discount from its 60-day average VWAP. The stock had not been available at such a large discount to its prevailing average since May 2016, which happens to be when Buffett bought his first-ever shares of Apple. At its close of $183.83 on Friday, however, Apple now stands at a premium of nearly 7 percent to its 60-day VWAP of $172.11. Prior to last quarter, Apple’s largest-ever quarterly repurchase occurred in early 2014, a year after it initiated its first $210 billion buyback program. The stock traded at a discount to its 60-day VWAP through much of the quarter, and Apple spent $18 billion to buy up its own shares, according to filings.
