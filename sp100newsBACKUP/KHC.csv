2,KHC,Wall St pours money into consumer staples as valuations climb,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Investors looking for stability and dividends have been pouring money into consumer staples stocks of late, ignoring warnings from Wall Street’s analysts about pricey valuations for companies like Clorox (CLX.N) and Campbell Soup (CPB.N). Widely viewed as relatively safe bets in a world of macroeconomic worries, shares of companies selling everyday consumer products like processed food and cleaning supplies have outperformed most other sectors in the past year, and fund flow data suggests investors expect more of the same. The number of new institutional owners, like hedge funds, pension funds and mutual funds, of Campbell Soup in the last quarter has jumped 92 percent, according to research firm Morningstar. New institutional owners of Coca Cola Co rose 81 percent. In the past two weeks, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPRD ETF (XLP) attracted $333 million in net flows while just $105 million went into the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR fund (XLY), according to ETF.com. With relatively high dividend yields, including a 4 percent annual payout to shareholders from Philip Morris International (PM.N), consumer staples companies remain a key holding for investors worried about a shaky global economy, even as the United States shows signs of slow improvement.  Consumer staples companies in the S&P; 500 are expected on average to post 3.7 percent higher earnings in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That is better than an expected 0.8-percent increase across the S&P; 500 but not as good as the 12.4-percent earnings jump predicted for the consumer discretionary sector.  “We still want a fair amount of exposure to staples,” said Thomas Martin, a portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments, which owns shares in Campbell, Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), Estee Lauder Companies Inc (EL.N), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N) and tobacco companies.  “The economy is still bumping along on a slow-growth trajectory,” he said. The S&P; consumer staples index .SPLRCS now trades at about 20 times expected earnings, compared with 17 for the consumer discretionary index .SPLRCD, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Following the consumer staples index’s 12 percent rise in the past year, some analysts warn of high valuations, with General Mills (GIS.N), Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and most other companies in the sector trading above 20 times expected earnings, compared with an average of 17 across the S&P; 500. “On the consumer defensive side, we view in general the industry as a bit inflated,” said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash.  A year ago, Campbell Soup, Kellogg (K.N), McCormick & Company (MKC.N) and Clorox were among the 10 S&P; 500 stocks with the worst average recommendations by sell-side analysts. Many of them warned about a strong dollar’s impact on demand overseas and stagnant sales as consumer tastes shifted toward fresher foods. But since then, those stocks have each gained between 21 percent and 31 percent, lifted by cost-cutting initiatives that have improved margins and progress updating their product lineups to appeal to new consumer tastes for “natural” and organic food. The S&P; 500 is up 1 percent from a year ago. ",6062016,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-consumerstaples-stocks/wall-st-pours-money-into-consumer-staples-as-valuations-climb-idUSL1N18S1FH
3,KHC,Australian watchdog sues Heinz over 'Little Kids' health claims,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s consumer watchdog on Tuesday sued the Australian subsidiary of U.S.-based Kraft Heinz Co alleging it falsely advertised the nutritional value of its Little Kids Shredz range of food for young children.

It faces penalties of up to A$1.1 million ($821,700) for each breach.

5,KHC,"Kraft, Mondelez must face wheat price-rigging lawsuit: U.S. judge","(Reuters) - A federal judge in Chicago on Monday refused to dismiss a lawsuit in which wheat futures and options traders accused Kraft Heinz Co and Mondelez International Inc of illegally manipulating the grain’s price at their expense. U.S. District Judge Edmond Chang said traders may pursue claims that a large and, in their view, unnecessary late 2011 purchase by Kraft Foods Inc of wheat futures contracts violated the Sherman antitrust law and the Commodity Exchange Act. In a 66-page decision, Chang also dismissed claims that the defendants conducted offsetting “wash trades” over roughly a decade to create an illusion of greater market activity. He said the traders can try to bring those claims again. Kraft and Mondelez were named as defendants because most of the alleged suspicious activity occurred before Kraft Foods Inc split in two in 2012. Mondelez brands now include snack foods such as Oreos, Ritz crackers and Wheat Thins. Many of the allegations were similar to those raised by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in an April 2015 lawsuit against Kraft and Mondelez. A Kraft Heinz spokesman and a Mondelez spokeswoman declined to comment on the decision. Vincent Briganti, a lawyer for the traders, said he was pleased the court found “multiple viable claims.” The CFTC said Kraft Foods bought $90 million of December 2011 wheat futures, giving it a dominant position in that market, despite never intending to take possession of the grain. It said Kraft Foods did so to depress prices in the cash wheat market, because sellers might believe the company needed less wheat, and inflate futures prices. It said the strategy led to more than $5.4 million of illegal profit. Last December, another judge rejected a defense motion to  dismiss the CFTC lawsuit. Both companies have said Mondelez expects to bear most costs from that case. Mondelez believes any court-ordered fine or settlement would not be material to investors, the company spokeswoman said. Kraft merged last year with H.J. Heinz Co to create Kraft Heinz, whose products include Kraft cheese, Heinz ketchup, Oscar Mayer deli meats and Maxwell House coffee. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc owns a roughly 26.8 percent stake in Kraft Heinz.    The case is Ploss v.

7,KHC,"UPDATE 1-Kraft Heinz's quarterly profit quadruples, shares jump","(Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), the maker of Velveeta cheese, Heinz ketchup and Oscar Mayer meats, is reviewing all its product categories to improve quality, an executive said on Thursday, as it works to win over customers whose tastes have shifted away from processed foods. The world’s fifth largest food and beverage company addressed its plans to react to the shift in demand toward fresher foods and items perceived to be healthier after it reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings. Shares rose 4 percent in after hours trading. “Our biggest challenge remains the fact that we continue to have a number of categories where consumption trends are working against us,” Chief Executive Officer Bernardo Hees told analysts on a conference call to discuss earnings. The company, which was created when Kraft Foods Group merged with H.J. Heinz Co in July last year, will develop new products to meet changing tastes, said George Zoghbi, chief operating officer for U.S. commercial business. It plans to launch new dessert, cheese and frozen items in the second half of the year.     In April, the company launched an organic Capri Sun juice drink and last year, it said it was revamping its macaroni and cheese meal to remove synthetic colors and preservatives. “We keep looking at every category within our portfolio,” Zoghbi said. Other food companies and restaurants have also changed products in response to customer demand. On Monday, McDonald’s announced it would replace high-fructose corn syrup in its sandwich buns with sugar. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Bryan Spillane told Kraft Heinz executives on the earnings call that “declining consumption looks like it’s going to be with us for awhile.”    Pro-forma net sales were $6.79 billion, down 4.7 percent and in-line with the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The report by the U.S. Labor Department showed that 255,000 jobs were added in July, handily beating economists’ estimate of 180,000. The report also showed that the unemployment rate was flat at 4.9 percent, staying below the 5 percent mark associated with full employment. Average hourly wages rose by 8 cents. The Federal Reserve’s move to raise interest rates is contingent on a number of economic indicators, including a strong labor market and inflation meeting the central bank’s 2 percent target. However, the markets have priced in little chance of the Fed raising rates this year as global growth worries persist. Dow e-minis contracts were up 66 points, or 0.36 percent at 8:30 a.m. ET (1230 GMT), with 18,006 contracts changing hands.

12,KHC,"UPDATE 3-Berkshire profit up 25 percent as insurance helps, BNSF weighs","(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Friday said its second-quarter profit rose 25 percent, helped by improvement in insurance underwriting, investment gains and the purchase of Precision Castparts Corp, Warren Buffett’s largest acquisition. But operating results fell short of analyst forecasts, as depressed oil prices and coal demand weighed on volume at the conglomerate’s BNSF railroad unit, while units serving the oil, gas and heavy equipment industries struggled. Other businesses, including the Geico auto insurer, fared better. Net income for Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire rose to $5 billion, or $3,042 per Class A share, from $4.01 billion, or $2,442, a year earlier. Operating profit rose 18 percent to $4.61 billion, or $2,803 per Class A share, from $3.89 billion, or $2,367.  Analysts on average expected operating profit of about $2,911 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 6 percent to $54.46 billion. Book value per share, Buffett’s preferred measure of growth, rose 1.7 percent from the end of March to $160,009. Buffett has over the years diversified Berkshire far beyond its insurance roots, including through the $32.1 billion January purchase of Precision Castparts, which makes aircraft parts, and February acquisition of Duracell, which makes batteries. But many operations remain anchored in the United States, and several struggled with the same pressures stemming from low commodities and materials prices and demand. “Some of the ‘old economy’ businesses lagged, hurt by the weaker energy sector, but the insurance businesses turned around, especially Geico,” S&P; Global analyst Cathy Seifert said in an interview. “This is a conglomerate, and you have to take the good with the bad.” Insurance underwriting swung to a $337 million profit from a year-earlier loss of $38 million. That helped boost overall insurance profit, including investment income, 40 percent to $1.32 billion. The improvement included a near tripling of pre-tax underwriting gain at Geico, which added customers and boosted premiums while its rate of loss claims fell. Meanwhile, currency fluctuations helped Berkshire’s namesake reinsurance business swing to a $184 million pre-tax gain from a year-earlier $411 million loss. Float, or the amount of insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and which help fund Berkshire’s growth, grew to $90 billion from $89 billion at the end of March. Investments and derivatives overall generated $394 million of profit, compared with $123 million a year earlier. Most resulted from Kraft Heinz Co’s redemption of $8.32 billion of preferred stock that Berkshire held. Berkshire still owns a 26.8 percent stake in the food company, which is run day-to-day by Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital. The redemption also left Berkshire with more cash, $72.68 billion, than it had before it acquired Precision. “Investors should expect more acquisitions,” Seifert said. She has a “hold” rating on Berkshire, which does not pay a dividend and has outgained the Standard & Poor’s 500 this year. The April-to-June period was Precision’s first full quarter as a Berkshire unit, and helped boost pre-tax profit in Berkshire’s industrial products sector by 34 percent. Excluding Precision and Duracell, however, profit in that sector fell, hurt by what Berkshire called “soft market conditions” and competitive pressures that drove prices lower. BNSF saw profit fall 20 percent to $772 million and revenue drop 15 percent to $4.59 billion, though speed and on-time performance improved following costly capital upgrades in 2015. Among other businesses, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility unit mostly owned by Berkshire, saw profit fall 4 percent to $482 million, hurt by lower revenue from renewable energy and changes in the value of interest-rate swaps. Berkshire has roughly 90 operating businesses, including smaller units that sell such things as candy, ice cream, insulation, jewelry, kitchenware, running shoes and underwear. As of June 30 it also owned about $133 billion of stocks including Kraft Heinz, Wells Fargo & Co, Coca-Cola Co and IBM Corp. Berkshire maintained it has no plan to sell IBM, despite sitting on a $1.5 billion loss. In Friday trading, Berkshire’s Class A shares rose $3,180 to $218,010, and its Class B shares rose $2.53 to $145.65. The shares are 5 percent below their December 2014 record highs.

According to the Brazil Journal blog, which cited people close to 3G, at least 10 wealthy Brazilian investors had already committed a minimum $100 million each to the new fund. Alexandre Behring, the 3G partner who is in charge of the firm’s day-to-day operations, has remained closely involved in the fundraising effort, the blog said. Calls to 3G’s office in Rio de Janeiro went unanswered. Investors have long speculated what the next target for Lemann, who is worth $28 billion according to Forbes Magazine, and 3G could be Oreo cookies maker Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) or General Mills Inc (GIS.N), which owns Pillsbury and Betty Crocker.  The blog said an acquisition would be done through Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), in which 3G has a 24 percent stake. Shares in Mondelez gained 3.7 percent to $45.87, while General Mills added 2.4 percent to $63.32 in mid-afternoon trading on Tuesday. According to the blog, Lemann’s camp has declined politely checks between $20 million and $50 million for the new fund, on the grounds that larger money commitments could optimize any fundraising efforts. Tennis player Roger Federer and supermodel Gisele Bündchen are among investors in the new vehicle, Brazil Journal said. Lemann, a globe-trotting financier with Swiss roots, rose to prominence over the past decade following a series of mega deals that drew praise and funding from U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett. Both tycoons have teamed up several times in the past, the most recent being a joint effort to buy ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co for $23.2 billion three years ago. Harvard University-educated Lemann and longtime partners Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles are 3G Capital’s main partners. They are one of the largest investors in Anheuser Busch InBev SA (ABI.BR), the world’s largest beer maker. Buffett also helped finance the 3G-engineered merger of Burger King Corp with Canadian donut chain Tim Hortons, creating Restaurant Brands International Inc (QSR.TO).

26,KHC,3G will take another bite of Corporate America,"CHICAGO (Reuters Breakingviews) - The Brazilian billionaires at 3G Capital that turned Kraft Heinz and Anheuser-Busch InBev into mega-acquisition machines will dive back into the buying business in the coming year. Their next target should be Mondelez, the $66 billion food conglomerate that failed to coax chocolate-maker Hershey into a sale in 2016. A deal will require some unusual ingredients.     3G - co-founded by banker-turned-beer-magnate Jorge Paulo Lemann - gobbled up Heinz for $28 billion in 2013 with the help of Warren Buffett. Two years later, Lemann and his partners combined Heinz ketchup with Cheez Whiz with a $36 billion swoop on Kraft. Speculation about 3G’s next target heated up in early November after a Brazilian blog said it was raising up to $10 billion of fresh funds. Using the combined Kraft Heinz to swallow Mondelez, whose shares gained as much as 12 percent on Wednesday after a Swiss news report said a bid was in the works, would be a natural next step.     While the maker of Cadbury chocolates run by Irene Rosenfeld has been cutting costs since it was spun out of Kraft four years ago, it’s still not as profitable as its former parent. That would give 3G new fat to cut after it finishes stripping out $1.5 billion of merger-related savings at Kraft Heinz by the end of 2017.     It would be about a $100 billion mouthful, including assumed debt, supposing 3G paid a 30 percent premium. The equity required would be daunting: Kraft Heinz owners would have to fork over nearly $60 billion of it to keep combined net debt below five times EBITDA. If they use Kraft shares, 3G and Buffett - who today own just over half the firm - would end up with less than a third of the enlarged entity.     But they’d still be the biggest shareholders by a mile. And the financial rewards could be mouth-watering. 3G sought savings worth 6 percent of combined sales in the Kraft Heinz merger. Apply that to the 2017 revenue analysts are penciling in for Kraft Heinz and Mondelez, and the buyers could squeeze out over $3 billion more pre-tax income a year, worth more than $20 billion taxed and capitalized.     If Mondelez proves too rich, Kraft could seek out a smaller target. Buying cereal makers Kellogg or General Mills without racking up excessive debt would require a more manageable $12 billion and $22 billion of equity, respectively. But neither offers the scale of a Mondelez deal. Whichever way the cookie crumbles, 3G is poised to take another bite out of Corporate America.

Trading was mixed as investors digested recent record highs fueled by the “Trump Rally” that has seen the S&P; 500 rise about almost 10 percent since the November presidential election. The S&P; energy sector fell 0.75 percent as oil prices slipped while Wells Fargo and Citigroup both lost about 0.6 percent, with the financial index down 0.3 percent. Signs of a strengthening economy as well as anticipated tax cuts have driven much of the week’s gains. With a strong fourth-quarter earnings season mostly complete, many investors say they need concrete signs of progress from Trump on his policy plans. Uncertainty around other potential Trump policies is an additional risk, some investors say. “People are focusing on only the good of what his campaign promises were,” said Lindsey Bell, an investment strategist at CFRA Research. “What makes me nervous is that it feels like the market is ignoring what could come on immigration, trade, healthcare - the negative implications that could come from a protectionist government.” With a long weekend ahead due to the Presidents Day holiday on Monday, investors trading volume was expected to remain thin. At 2:19 pm ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.25 percent at 20,567.28 points, while the S&P; 500 had lost 0.11 percent to 2,344.63. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.15 percent to 5,823.39. Th Nasdaq’s increase was driven by an 8.49-percent jump in Kraft Heinz, which said it would continue to pursue a $143 billion bid for Unilever, despite being rebuffed.

About 23 hedge funds held a combined 1.2 percent in Kraft on Wednesday before the bid was announced on Friday. The 5.3 percent rise took the stock to an all-time high. Multi-manager firms Millennium Management, Citadel and Balyasny Asset Management were among those holding the stock, Reuters Eikon data shows.

39,KHC,Options bets on Unilever surged ahead of Kraft Heinz bid,"NEW YORK, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Options on the U.S-listed shares of Unilever drew unusually large and bullish trading activity ahead of Friday’s disclosure by Kraft Heinz Co  that it had made a $143 billion bid for the Anglo-Dutch food company. Despite Unilever’s rejection of the bid, the company’s U.S.-listed share price rose more than 14 percent on Friday.  The gains, however, paled in comparison with the sharp appreciation in certain bullish options contracts bought over the last two days leading up to the rejected bid. With shares near $42 on Wednesday, traders lapped up near-dated bullish options contracts on Unilever NV in heavy volume. A total of 11,141 contracts changed hands, compared with the average daily trading volume of just 210 contracts, per options analytics firm Trade Alert. “The timing of these large call buys is certainly interesting given the news Friday morning,” said Fred Ruffy, options analyst at New York-based Trade Alert. Calls betting on Unilever NV shares rising more than 7 percent by mid-March were the most actively traded with 6,303 contracts changing hands. The shares were at $48.26 at 1.32 p.m. (0632 GMT) on Friday, up $5.94 or 14 percent. Buying a call conveys the right to purchase shares at a fixed price in the future, while buying puts conveys the right to sell shares. These calls, which were bought for an average price of 20.5 cents each, traded as high as $2.85 on Friday. For example, one trade on Wednesday where an investor actually paid $10,000 for 500 March 45 call options would have resulted in a net profit of  $132,500 by Friday if the position was closed at the high price. “The timing of the purchases, and the fact that the focus was on short-term calls, with a strike price higher than the share price, suggests that somebody was anticipating a short-term advance in shares,” Ruffy said. Options activity has been known to spike before the public announcement of deals, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has in the past announced enforcement action for alleged insider trading involving options. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

40,KHC,Kraft Heinz may have to pass hat to buy Unilever,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - The world’s wiliest takeover artists have found their biggest target yet. Kraft Heinz, the Kool-Aid-to-Velveeta conglomerate, has offered $143 billion for Unilever, its Anglo-Dutch rival. Even for 3G Capital, the private investment firm behind Kraft Heinz, beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev and Burger King owner Restaurant Brands International, it’s an audacious move. To land Unilever, which rejected the offer, Kraft Heinz may need to pass the hat around to shareholders like Warren Buffett. The secret sauce that 3G’s five Brazilian founders apply to the companies they invest in is what’s known as zero-based budgeting. This is the practice of starting from scratch in assessing the expenses of every part of the business. As frightening as that sounds for employees, it has been a boon for shareholders. So much so, that rivals of 3G enterprises now often pepper their corporate-speak with the short-form “ZBB.” Unilever offers a salivating opportunity for 3G to work their cost-cutting magic. The sprawling group led by Paul Polman, whose brands spread from Magnum ice cream and Dove soaps to Lipton teas, reported a 2016 operating profit margin of just 15 percent, compared to 23 percent at Kraft and around the same at Procter & Gamble. If 3G could capture Unilever, slash expenses and close that gap, it might generate more than $4 billion a year of extra pre-tax profit. The present value of those potential savings, after tax, is more than sufficient to cover the roughly $20 billion premium Kraft Heinz offered. In fact, it leaves room to sweeten the 18 percent uplift significantly. The problem, though, is paying for it. As it stands, the offer is over 60 percent in cash. Funding that $86 billion slug with debt would triple the net amount currently borrowed by the two companies combined to roughly $130 billion. Even allowing for generous cost savings, the ratio of debt to EBITDA could surge well above five times, Breakingviews calculates. Of course Kraft Heinz could also raise cash by issuing new shares, reducing the need to borrow. Here’s where 3G and its cash-rich partner, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, come in. If they want to retain their current majority control, they might have to pony up $50 billion or more between them. That would bring the enlarged company’s leverage down to below three times EBITDA. As well as keeping the two investors in charge, the Kraft Heinz M&A; machine would then have much more capacity to continue devouring other food companies and spreading the ZBB cult across the planet.",2172017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-unilever-m-a-kraft-breakingviews/kraft-heinz-may-have-to-pass-hat-to-buy-unilever-idUSKBN15W1Z1

42,KHC,Lazard big winner if Kraft Heinz eats Unilever,"LONDON, Feb 17 (IFR) - Blue chip advisers in the City of London could reap a fee bonanza of more than US$200m from Kraft Heinz’s US$143bn approach for Anglo-Dutch household goods group Unilever, which was immediately rejected. Lazard is financial adviser to Kraft Heinz. Morgan Stanley and Centerview are acting for Unilever, alongside retained corporate brokers UBS and Deutsche. Kraft Heinz did not disclose the terms of any transaction. Unilever said the proposal was pitched at US$50 a share, a premium of 18% to Thursday’s closing price of 3347.5p, and was a mix of US$30.23 in cash, payable in US dollars, and 0.222 of shares in the new company. The deal is larger than AB InBev’s US$110bn takeover of fellow brewer SAB Miller, completed last year. That was another coup for Lazard, which was lead adviser to AB InBev. That deal brought in an estimated US$123m in fees for Lazard, and US277m for all the financial advisers on the deal. Kraft Heinz was only created in 2015 via a cash and shares offer from Heinz for Kraft, valuing the latter at US$51bn. Lazard advised Heinz on that deal and Centerview acted for Kraft. The deal was financed by US investor Warren Buffett and Brazilian private equity group 3G. The duo ended up with 51% of the resulting company and Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is now the largest shareholder with 26.75% stake. Lazard’s UK head William Rucker is named as an adviser on the Unilever approach, alongside Will Lawes and Alexander Hecker in the US. Centerview are in a prime position to advise Unilever. It has a number of consumer specialists and also boasts Nick Reid, formerly a senior M&A; adviser at UBS, where the Marmite and Persil maker was a client. Reid is helped by David Krap, James Tookman in the UK and Robert Pruzan in the US. Morgan Stanley’s team consists of Henry Stewart, Mark Rawlinson, Adrian Doyle and Anthony Zammit with Benjamin Frost in the US. The firm has built a niche as a strong bid defence specialist. HSBC has also advised Unilever on recent bond issues, with Citigroup, Deutsche and Santander. One name missing from the roster so far is Goldman Sachs, last year’s lead M&A; adviser by value of deals, according to Thomson Reuters. This year it is in fifth position on announced deals, with Morgan Stanley leading the table followed by Citigroup, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Lazard. After these announcements, Morgan Stanley would enhance its lead significantly with Lazard firmly in second position, followed by Deutsche, Centerview and UBS, pushing Goldman down to eighth. Unilever rejected the offer as too low. Kraft Heinz said it would work to reach agreement on the terms of a transaction. A firm offer would need to be lodged on March 17 under UK Takeover Code rules.

46,KHC,RPT-3G Capital's austere empire-building weighs on Kraft's Unilever bid,"(Repeats story published Friday to widen distribution) By Michael Flaherty and Lauren Hirsch Feb 18 (Reuters) - Buyout firm 3G Capital managed to build a consumer empire with a market value of over $140 billion in just seven years. Yet its ruthless approach to costs may end up hampering 3G-backed Kraft Heinz Co’s $143 billion bid for Unilever Plc. 3G made its name in corporate America by orchestrating large debt-laden acquisitions and then slashing costs dramatically to juice profits. Using a strategy called zero-based budgeting, its managers must justify all expenses, from pencils to forklifts. Its investment approach has attracted backers ranging from billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has helped bankroll all four major 3G deals, to celebrities such as supermodel Gisele Bundchen and tennis champion Roger Federer, who invested in 3G’s latest approximately $10 billion fund. This relentless focus on costs, however, may end up making Kraft’s pursuit of Unilever more difficult. In rebuffing Kraft’s bid publicly on Friday, Unilever cited “strategic” in addition to financial reasons. While sources told Reuters that Kraft believes that investing in innovation would be an important part of the combined company, analysts have begun to question whether 3G’s operational approach hinders Kraft’s ability to grow over the long term. “We can understand how some investors could wonder if Kraft’s efficiency-centric model is as sustainable as many have believed,” Barclays analysts said earlier this month. Kraft’s sales were down 3.8 percent to $6.86 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Kraft has attributed the decline in sales to a pruning of its portfolio, as it weeds out non-profitable products. It sees tight operational management as perfectly compatible with sales growth. Unilever, the London and Rotterdam-based owner of Dove soap and Hellmann’s mayonnaise brands, defines itself as a business “making sustainable living commonplace.” This means putting money with an eye beyond the immediate bottom line, such as products with low environmental impact and resources toward bringing safe water to under-served regions. “(The rebuff of Kraft) makes us also wonder if Unilever’s focus on sustainability might make it very resistant to any further approach from Kraft,” said Royal Bank of Canada analyst David Palmer. Adding to Kraft’s challenges, the U.S. consumer food company will need to either integrate or find other options for Unilever’s household and personal care (HPC) business, which makes products such as toothpaste, soaps and detergents. “It seems plausible that the HPC piece of (Unilever) then becomes a merger partner for something 3G might do on its own in HP. In other words, this could be part one of a huge two-step process,” said Don Bilson, head of research at event-driven research firm Gordon Haskett. Kraft, Unilever and 3G Capital declined to comment. Co-founded by Brazilian billionaire financier Jorge Paulo Lemann, 3G combined Kraft and H.J. Heinz Co in 2015 to create a company that now has a $112 billion market capitalization, and combined Burger King and Tim Hortons in 2014 in a $11 billion deal. The 3G management philosophy was developed by Lemann and Brazilian investment bankers Marcel Herrmann Telles and Carlos Alberto Sicupira, and pioneered at Budweiser brewer Anheuser Busch InBev, the world’s biggest brewer, which they helped create through a series of big mergers. Lemann, Telles and Alberto Sicupira made their mark at Banco Garantia, the investment bank they founded in Brazil in the 1970s. After selling it to Credit Suisse Group AG in 1998, they formed private equity firm 3G to invest in U.S. consumer names. After 3G teamed up with billionaire Buffett to buy Heinz in 2013, they closed six factories and cut 7,000 jobs in 18 months. Operating margins jumped from 18 percent to 26 percent. Lemann, Brazil’s richest man and a former tennis pro, once served on the board of Gillette, where he met Buffett, who has partnered with Lemann on Heinz and Kraft and has said he would like to do more deals.

49,KHC,Kraft Heinz bids $143 bln for Unilever in global brand grab,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. food company Kraft Heinz Co made a surprise $143 billion offer for Unilever Plc in a bid to build a global consumer goods giant, although it was flatly rejected on Friday by the maker of Lipton tea and Dove soap. A combination would be the third-biggest takeover in history and the largest acquisition of a UK-based company, according to Thomson Reuters data. It would bring together some of the world’s best known brands, from toothpaste to ice creams, and combine Kraft’s  strength in the United States with Unilever’s in Europe and Asia. The global packaged food industry is grappling with slowing growth, new competition from upstart brands, deflation in developed markets and more health-conscious consumers. Although Kraft, which is controlled by U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett and private equity firm 3G Capital, said it looked forward to talking terms, Unilever said it saw no reason to discuss a deal without financial or strategic merit. Kraft approached Unilever earlier this week, according to people familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified because the approach was confidential. Kraft believes that investing in innovation would be an important part of the combined company, one of the people said. Kraft has also offered to keep three headquarters for the combined company in the United States, Britain and the Netherlands, the source added. Credit rating agency Moody’s characterized the bid for Unilever as “credit negative” as the combined company would be more highly financially leveraged. There would be offsetting benefits such as cost savings, an expanded geographic footprint and improved product diversification, the agency said. Kraft wants the combined company’s credit rating to be investment-grade, according to the sources. Kraft has until March 17 to make a final bid for Unilever under UK takeover rules. Unilever shares rose to a record following news of the offer, which analysts at Jefferies called a “seismic shock”, and  closed 15 percent higher, short of Kraft’s $50 per share offer price, with the news lifting shares across the sector. Unilever said Kraft’s proposal included $30.23 per share in cash, payable in U.S. dollars, and 0.222 of a share in a new enlarged entity per Unilever share and represented an 18 percent premium to its share price on Thursday. “We believe Kraft will likely need to raise its offer substantially if it hopes to change the outcome,” RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said in a research note. Kraft’s move could flush out other bidders for Unilever, but of the potential rivals, U.S. consumer giant Procter & Gamble Co  may face anti-trust hurdles, while pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods company Johnson and Johnson would likely not be interested in household products. Unilever, which has struggled recently amid slowing growth and currency fluctuations, saw its shares tumble 4.5 percent on Jan. 26, its worst day in nearly a year, when the company reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter sales. The share plunge encouraged Kraft to make an approach, another source familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named because the matter is confidential. Unilever has been hit by a slowdown in emerging markets, which it and other consumer companies have long relied on for growth, as well as in its home market, where consumers have been rattled after “Brexit,” Britain’s decision to leave the European Union last year. Brexit pushed down the value of the pound, raising the cost of producing consumer goods in Britain and straining relations between the country’s retailers and suppliers. For Kraft, its move comes as low interest rates and cheap debt have fuelled big cross-border deals, making it the busiest start to the year for M&A; activity on record. Still, investors will look at Kraft-Heinz’s own track record of boosting sales when evaluating whether they can help Unilever cope with its own slowed growth. Kraft’s sales fell 3.8 percent to $6.86 billion in the fourth quarter ending Dec. 31, and its U.S. sales, which account for more than 70 percent of total sales, fell 3.1 percent to $4.84 billion. Kraft Heinz shares rose more than 10 percent in New York trading, helping lift the Nasdaq to a record high. Although Kraft is smaller than Unilever, with a market value of $106 billion as of Thursday, it is 50.9-percent owned by Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and 3G Capital, which also controls Anheuser-Busch InBev. 3G, known for driving profits through aggressive cost cutting, has orchestrated a string of big deals rocking the food and drink industry, including Anheuser-Busch InBev’s takeover of SABMiller and the combination of Kraft and Heinz. A deal would offer opportunities to combine marketing, manufacturing and distribution in addition to cutting costs, but some industry analysts said Kraft might not want Unilever’s household and personal goods brands and could spin them off. “This is cheap money meeting industrial logic,” said Steve Clayton, manager of the HL Select UK Shares fund at Hargreaves Lansdown, which owns Unilever shares. “Kraft Heinz are attempting a massive push on the fast forward button ... To acquire the sheer scale of brands that Unilever represents through one-off acquisitions could take decades,” Clayton added. Britain’s largest union, Unite, represents employees at Unilever, according to its website. Unite urged Unilever to continue fending off the takeover attempt to prevent job losses. Unilever employs 168,000 people and generates roughly 17 percent of its revenue in the United States compared with Kraft-Heinz, which generates roughly 78 percent in America. A recent wave of cross-border deals in Europe is leaving British businesses vulnerable to possible job cuts. Pegeuot SA’s  proposed acquisition of General Motors Co’s Opel business may eventually lead to heavy restructuring at the Vauxhall brands, which employ 4,500 people in Britain, sources said.

A deal would offer opportunities to combine marketing, manufacturing and distribution in addition to cutting costs, but some industry analysts said Kraft might not want Unilever’s household and personal goods brands and could spin them off.  “This is cheap money meeting industrial logic,” said Steve Clayton, manager of the HL Select UK Shares fund at Hargreaves Lansdown, which owns Unilever shares.  “Kraft Heinz are attempting a massive push on the fast forward button ... To acquire the sheer scale of brands that Unilever represents through one-off acquisitions could take decades,” Clayton added.  Britain’s largest union, Unite, represents employees at Unilever, according to its website. Unite urged Unilever to continue fending off the takeover attempt to prevent job losses.  Unilever employs 168,000 people and generates roughly 17 percent of its revenue in the United States compared with Kraft-Heinz, which generates roughly 78 percent in America. A recent wave of cross-border deals in Europe is leaving British businesses vulnerable to possible job cuts. Pegeuot SA’s proposed acquisition of General Motors Co’s Opel business may eventually lead to heavy restructuring at the Vauxhall brands, which employ 4,500 people in Britain, sources said. Centerview and Morgan Stanley are working with Unilever alongside UBS and Deutsche Bank, who are also acting as corporate brokers. Kraft is working with Lazard.

57,KHC,Collapse of Kraft-Unilever tie-up extends run of failed mega-deals,"LONDON (Reuters) - Kraft Heinz’s (KHC.O) dropped bid to buy Unilever (ULVR.L) is the third-largest M&A; deal to collapse, according to Thomson Reuters data, adding to a recent run of failures that highlights the appetite for the pursuit of audacious mega-mergers. The abrupt U-turn by U.S. foods giant Kraft at the weekend pushed the value of deals withdrawn this year to $205.2 billion, compared with $53.6 billion at the same point in 2016. The effect of proposed big deals on those numbers is clear, with the 87 deals to have collapsed this year significantly lower than the 111 that fell through in the corresponding period last year. The value of failed deals is likely to continue, bankers say, with companies still likely to seek ambitious acquisitions.  “There has been no punishment by the market or investors if a deal does not close. The overall context has been shareholder support for trying to get deals done and that has been an engine of growth in the M&A; market,” said Severin Brizay, head of M&A; for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Swiss bank UBS (UBSG.S) Kraft had pursued Unilever as part of its strategy to become a global consumer goods giant, but it received a hostile reception from the Anglo-Dutch company and cited a lack of “strategic” merit for its withdrawal from a deal that would have had a value of $162.2 billion based on the offer price plus Unilever’s debt. Yet the complexity of such huge deals can throw up multiple obstacles. The biggest withdrawn deal came last April when U.S. drugmaker Pfizer’s (PFE.N) attempt to buy Ireland-based Allergan  (AGN.N) for $160 billion floundered on the introduction of U.S. Treasury rules to curb tax-cutting inversion deals. Honeywell International’s (HON.N) attempt to buy United Technologies for $90.7 billion ended in failure last February after United Tech rejected the deal on expectations that it would be blocked by antitrust regulators.  Those helped to lift the value of withdrawn deals last year to an eight-year high, with transactions worth $808 billion withdrawn or rejected, compared with $538 billion in 2015.  Another to fall by the wayside on competition concerns was the proposed $6.3 billion merger of office supply chain Staples SPLS.O with smaller rival Office Depot (ODP.O). “When you are No.1 and No.2 in your sector it’s difficult for the regulator to approve,” said Raj Karia, of global corporate and financial law firm Norton Rose Fulbright. Thomson Reuters classifies a deal as withdrawn if there is a public announcement by the buyer that the offer is withdrawn or financial and legal advisers agree that it has been withdrawn.

58,KHC,Kraft's failed Unilever bid shows it needs growth over cost cuts,"(Reuters) - Acquire, slash costs, repeat. Billionaire investor Warren Buffet and buyout firm 3G Capital’s failed $143 billion bid to combine their food conglomerate Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) with Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) shows their winning formula now needs a growth boost. Buffett and 3G built Kraft into the world’s fifth-largest food and beverage company through acquisitions followed by a relentless drive to boost profit margins. While this cost cut-driven business model wowed industry observers, it appears to be reaching its limits, with Kraft’s sales stagnating and margins flattening. Kraft’s bid for Unilever was aimed at addressing these challenges. About 60 percent of Unilever’s business is comprised of household products and personal care (HPC) goods, rather than food. Not only would a deal give Kraft plenty of new ground on which to implement its cost-cutting model, it would boost its revenue by allowing it to expand in several emerging markets. Investment bankers and industry analysts now say Kraft is more likely to pursue another company with a big, growing HPC business, rather than a peer in the food sector that would require it to repeat the same M&A; cycle a couple of years later. “Perhaps Kraft will now acquire another medium-sized U.S. food company, like General Mills Inc (GIS.N), Kellogg Co (K.N), or Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O). But after three years this M&A; ‘beast’ will need to be fed once again, and the number of attractive U.S. targets is getting smaller,” Sanford C. Bernstein analysts wrote in a note on Monday. Kraft declined to comment on which company it may seek to acquire next.  Investors are already adjusting their bets. Shares of Unilever peers Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N), Clorox Co (CLX.N) and Church & Dwight Co Inc (CHD.N) rose 4.3 percent, 2.8 percent and 1.6 percent on Friday, respectively, on hopes of them being acquisition targets. Conversely, shares of General Mills, Kellogg and Mondelez dropped 3.8 percent, 2.4 percent, and 1.6 percent on Friday, respectively, as investors saw the chances of them being acquisitions targets for Kraft decreasing.  What is more, some of the food companies have been strengthening their takeover defenses by seeking to do themselves what Kraft would have otherwise done to them.  Mondelez spent a portion of its latest quarterly earnings call boasting about its cost-cutting initiatives, while Kellogg recently made changes to its distribution model to cut costs even more. Another reason Kraft is seeking to diversify its business is that consumers have themselves been gradually changing their diet, becoming more health conscious and moving away from the processed and sugar-rich foods that account for much of Kraft’s offerings. To address this, Kraft would need to spend top dollar on inventing and marketing new food brands, which requires expertise not developed by its reliance on acquisitions. Moving into HPC, particularly by acquiring a global company that would help it diversify its U.S.-focused business, now looks like a more attractive option. To be sure, Kraft would need to overcome the same hurdles that resulted in it being spurned by Unilever. Under the stewardship of 3G, Kraft has developed a reputation for extreme cost cuts that risk hurting a company’s top line by stifling investment in innovation and marketing. Indeed, Unilever’s rejection of Kraft’s bid was not just based on price considerations. The company feared that a merger with Kraft risked eroding the value of its brands and could impede its expansion in emerging markets, which requires more investment, people familiar with the company’s thinking told Reuters on Sunday. After 3G teamed up with Buffett to buy Heinz in 2013, they closed six factories and cut 7,000 jobs in 18 months. Operating margins jumped from 18 percent to 26 percent, thanks to their zero-based budgeting, which dictates that managers must meticulously justify all expenses, from pencils to forklifts. But now Kraft’s top line is struggling. Sales were down 3.8 percent at $6.86 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Kraft has attributed the decline in sales to a pruning of its portfolio, as it weeds out non-profitable products.  Unless Kraft can shed this image as a relentless cost-cutter, it could face similar opposition from other acquisition targets, particularly if it uses its stock as currency, thereby giving shareholders of the target exposure to the combined company.  Last week, two days before it unveiled its acquisition offer for Unilever, Kraft appeared to acknowledge that investors were concerned about its lack of new investment, stating it was focused on innovation and marketing.  “We will focus our investments in innovation, renovation and marketing on our leading brands,” Kraft Chief Executive Bernardo Vieira Hees said during the company’s latest quarterly earnings call on Wednesday.

60,KHC,"FTSE steadies after setting 1-month high, Unilever slumps","* FTSE 100 edges up 0.1 percent * Unilever slumps as Kraft withdraws offer * RBS up on alternative plan to Williams & Glyn sale * Hammerson gains after results * Pearson hit by broker target price cut   (ADVISORY- Follow European and UK stock markets in real time on the Reuters Live Markets blog on Eikon, see cpurl://apps.cp./cms/?pageId=livemarkets) By Atul Prakash and Helen Reid LONDON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index steadied after hitting a new one-month high on Monday, with a slump in Unilever after Kraft ditched its bid offset by stronger firms like Royal Bank of Scotland and Rolls Royce. Unilever shares tumbled nearly 7 percent and were on track for their biggest one-day fall since 2008 after U.S. food giant Kraft Heinz withdrew its proposal for a $143-billion merger with its larger rival. Kraft had made a surprise offer for Unilever to build a global consumer goods behemoth that was flatly rejected on Friday by Unilever, the maker of Lipton tea and Dove soap. “What exactly happened in this whirlwind of a story is yet to be fully revealed, but it looks like Unilever isn’t just playing hard to get,” said George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “It was always going to be a difficult pitch to convince shareholders to relinquish their grip on Unilever, given the expectations for the company to keep churning out resilient growth in the years to come.” Pearson also lost ground, with its shares falling 3.9 percent after Berenberg sharply cut its target price for the stock to 400 pence from 500 pence, saying it did not see a short-term fix for the company amid serious structural and cyclical issues at the key higher education courseware division. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index was flat in percentage terms at 7,299.86 points after climbing to an intra-day high of 7,329.56, the highest level since the middle of January. The broader index stayed steady despite sharp falls in shares of companies like Unilever and Pearson as some other firms made strong gains. Royal Bank of Scotland shares rose 6 percent, the top gainers in the FTSE 100 index, as the lender said late on Friday that it had proposed abandoning the disposal of its Williams & Glyn business after a seven-year struggle to sell the unit to meet European Union state aid demands. “On the face of it, removing this uncertainty would seem like good news for RBS investors, reflecting the fact that executing a disposal of Williams & Glyn was a key hurdle that the group needed to overcome before it could recommence paying dividends,” Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood said. Rolls Royce gained 6.3 percent after Goldman Sachs added the stock to its “Conviction List” and upgraded its rating on the aero-engine maker to “buy” from “neutral”, saying that its earnings performance was expected to improve. Hammerson, which owns and manages shopping centres, was among top gainers, up 4.3 percent after it posted an increase in net asset value per share and said its premium retail outlets continued to outperform. Liberum analysts, who give Hammerson a ‘hold’ rating, said: “Hammerson is the only European REIT to offer exposure to faster growing premium outlets,” adding that they remain cautious on the sustainability of rental growth due to weaker consumer confidence. British builder Bovis Homes slumped 10.2 percent, the biggest faller in the FTSE 250, after the company said profit would drop again this year as it builds fewer homes and focuses on improving quality. Small-cap support services and construction company Interserve plummeted 32.1 percent, its worst daily loss since 2002, after it doubled the charge for getting out of its energy-from-waste business.

61,KHC,Kraft Heinz is a good fire drill for Unilever,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Close shaves sometimes leave scars. Unilever boss Paul Polman can keep his M&A; defence powder dry following Kraft Heinz’s decision on Feb. 19 to walk away from its spurned bid. But the shock to the system will have an effect on the Anglo-Dutch food and household goods company.  Unilever shareholders may emphatically agree with their management’s rejection of a deal that would probably have seen top line growth sacrificed to lift the group’s 15 percent operating margin towards Kraft’s 23 percent. But the U.S. giant’s offer would have allowed them to exchange a company worth around $42 a share on Feb. 16 for cash and shares worth $50 a share. The onus is therefore now on Unilever to outline a plan to get there under its own steam. Polman had recognised the problem, and unveiled a cost-cutting programme last year. At the optimistic end of its own assumptions, Unilever might be able to boost its margin by 80 basis points a year. Imagine it can do so until end-2019, and also manages top line growth at the upper 5 percent end of its expectations. Put the resulting $11 billion of 2019 operating profit on Unilever’s 2019 operating profit multiple of 13, strip out net debt, and Unilever’s shares might be worth around $44 each - roughly where they are now trading.  That’s below Kraft’s initial offer, and itself relies on bullish assumptions. Meanwhile, big deals between consumer packaged goods companies have seen synergies worth 10 percent of sales in the past, according to Kepler Cheuvreux analysts. Tax and capitalise the $5.8 billion of savings this would imply and Kraft could theoretically have forked out $58 a share - implying double the 18 percent premium it had offered. Faced with these kinds of figures, Polman would either have to dramatically grow the group’s top line, or try a version of what Kraft owner 3G might have attempted. Cutting costs further and boosting the operating margin to 20 percent could push the share price to well over $50. Given how hard this looks to achieve, Unilever’s backup plan could be to tell shareholders what it told Kraft: too many cuts would impede top line growth. The shares’ current valuation implies they would hear him out. But they probably also want Polman to use Kraft’s approach as a spur for more self-help.",2202017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-unilever-m-a-breakingviews/kraft-heinz-is-a-good-fire-drill-for-unilever-idUSKBN15Z1FJ
62,KHC,UPDATE 2-Kraft backs out of Unilever bid after hostile reception,"LONDON (Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co’s (KHC.O) rapid retreat from its surprise $143 billion bid for Unilever (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS) in the face of stiff resistance knocked the Anglo-Dutch company’s shares on Monday as investors assessed the impact of the failed approach. Kraft, which is backed by Warren Buffett and the private equity firm 3G, wanted to buy Unilever as part of its strategy to become a global consumer goods giant by buying competitors and cutting costs and jobs to drive profits. However, the U.S. food group had not factored in Unilever Chief Executive Paul Polman dismissing its offer as having no financial or strategic merit and refusing to come to the table. The vehemence of this response, along with fears of a political backlash, was enough to put off 86-year old Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) has a long-held aversion to making hostile bids, sources told Reuters.   “Kraft didn’t realize how hostile their approach would be perceived,” one source said.      A source close to Kraft said its officials alerted Britain’s Business Secretary Greg Clark in a brief call on Friday soon after it made its approach public. Kraft laid out its plan to create a consumer goods behemoth with headquarters in the United States, Britain and the Netherlands and promised to keep Downing Street informed on any developments. For Kraft, Britain’s response was a major concern after Prime Minister Theresa May signaled she would take a more proactive approach to foreign takeovers, sources told Reuters. May, who had previously singled out Kraft’s 2010 acquisition of another British household name, Cadbury Plc, as an example of a deal that should have been blocked, had indicated her government would want to examine the deal if it went ahead, according to a person familiar with the situation.  However, a spokesman for May said on Monday the government had not been involved in Kraft’s decision to pull its proposal. “The issue of the withdrawal from the Unilever deal by Kraft is an issue you should put to Kraft. Number 10 wasn’t involved in it,” the spokesman told reporters. “The simple fact is that the bid has been withdrawn so I don’t have a view on a bid that doesn’t exist.” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who used to work at Unilever, had also said he would examine what it would mean for the Netherlands in the “positive and the negative” sense. Buffett and 3G Capital’s Jorge Paulo Lemann, which together own almost 51 percent of Kraft, had hoped Unilever would be more receptive to its overture, given their success backing brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev on its 79 billion pound takeover of London-based SABMiller last year.  The SABMiller deal — which ranked as the consumer industry’s biggest-ever merger and the biggest-ever takeover of a UK listed company  — had given Buffett and Lemann the confidence to pursue a bigger and riskier bet, one source said. Unilever’s London-listed shares, which jumped 13 percent to a record high when the bid was made public on Friday, fell 8 percent to give it a market value of 100 billion pounds after Kraft said in a statement on Sunday it had “amicably agreed” to withdraw its proposal. The company’s Dutch listed shares were down 7 percent and     analysts at Macquarie said Unilever’s stock should not give up all its gains following the approach, although some shareholders thought that another deal was unlikely. “Unilever’s share price is still performing remarkably well as I suppose the argument that these stocks were cheap versus borrowing costs is still valid,” a shareholder with one of the biggest 20 holdings in Unilever stock told Reuters. “A takeover at a later stage seems unlikely to me as Unilever will build their defense and sharpen their focus on profitability,” the shareholder added. A combination of the two firms would have been the largest acquisition of a UK-based company, Thomson Reuters data showed and would have brought together some of the world’s best known brands, from toothpaste to ice creams. While it would also have combined Kraft’s strength in the United States with Unilever’s in Europe and Asia, it would also have faced a potentially huge cultural clash. In 2013, 3G, which made its name in corporate America by orchestrating large debt-laden acquisitions and then slashing costs, teamed up with billionaire investor Buffett to acquire Heinz and then bought Kraft two years later.  Unilever feared that a merger with Kraft risked eroding the value of its brands and could impede its expansion in emerging markets, which requires more investment, people familiar with the company’s thinking said. “It was always going to be a difficult pitch to convince shareholders to relinquish their grip on Unilever, given the expectations for the company to keep churning out resilient growth in the years to come,” George Salmon, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.

63,KHC,Unilever shares tumble 8 pct after Kraft ditches bid,"LONDON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Shares in Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group Unilever  dropped 8 percent on Monday after U.S. rival Kraft Heinz Co abruptly ditched its surprise $143 billion merger proposal. Backed by Warren Buffett and the private equity firm 3G, Kraft had wanted to buy Unilever to build a global consumer goods giant but its offer was flatly rejected on Friday by the maker of Lipton tea and Dove soap. According to people familiar with the matter, Kraft had not expected to encounter the resistance it received from Unilever Chief Executive Paul Polman, who dismissed the offer as having no financial or strategic merit. Concerns had also been raised about political scrutiny in Britain where Prime Minister Theresa May had indicated she would be more proactive in vetting foreign takeovers when she took office last year. May had previously singled out Kraft’s 2010 acquisition of another British household name, Cadbury Plc, as an example of a deal that should have been blocked. The Financial Times said May had ordered officials to see if the proposed deal raised any concerns for the wider British economy and merits government intervention. 3G made its name in corporate America by orchestrating large debt-laden acquisitions and then slashing costs dramatically to drive profits. Unilever’s London-listed shares, which jumped 13 percent on Friday when the approach was made public, fell 8 percent in early trading on Monday. A combination of the two firms would have been the largest acquisition of a UK-based company, according to Thomson Reuters data. It would have brought together some of the world’s best known brands, from toothpaste to ice creams, and combine Kraft’s strength in the United States with Unilever’s in Europe and Asia.

Turnover was light with U.S. markets closed for the Presidents Day holiday. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.1 percent and back toward a 19-month peak reached last week. Japan’s Nikkei went flat after domestic data showed exports disappointed in January even as imports outpaced forecasts. Shanghai stocks added 0.9 percent and expectations of solid economic growth in China kept commodities such as copper and iron ore well bid. Spreadbetters predicted opening gains of 0.2 to 0.3 percent for bourses in Europe while E-mini futures for the S&P; 500  added 0.1 percent. Shares in Unilever Plc could retreat after U.S. food company Kraft Heinz Co withdrew its proposal for a $143 billion merger. Unilever’s shares jumped 13 percent on Friday on news of the bid. Wall Street ended last week on a roll, with all three major indexes making historic highs and the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching a seventh straight record close. A host of results from retailers are due this week, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Macy’s and Home Depot Inc. The results will be watched for a read on spending as well as for commentary from executives on President Donald Trump’s proposal to tax imports. On the interest rate front, no less than five heads of regional Federal Reserve bank are due to speak this week while Fed Board Governor Jerome Powell appears on Wednesday, when minutes of the last policy meeting are also due. Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said on Monday in Singapore that she would be comfortable raising interest rates at this point if the economy kept performing the way it has. Speculation the central bank could hike as soon as March has generally underpinned the U.S. dollar, though large long positions leave the market vulnerable to sudden pull backs. On Monday, the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies at 100.880 and a fraction firmer on the yen at 113.05. European politics kept the euro skittish. Germany’s centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) moved ahead of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) in an opinion poll by the Emnid institute for the first time since 2006, Bild am Sonntag said. On Friday, news the French left could unite behind one candidate in the presidential elections seemed to increase the chance of anti-EU, anti-immigrant Marine Le Pen winning, and knocked the single currency lower. The euro stood at $1.0616 on Monday, having fallen 0.6 percent on Friday, not far from the recent five-week low of $1.0520. Risk aversion sparked a rally in German bonds while widening the spread against French debt. Oil prices were a shade lower having suffered the first weekly decline in five weeks as the market weighed rising U.S. drilling and record stockpiles against efforts by major producers to cut output to reduce a global glut. Brent futures were up 4 cents at $55.85 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery added 5 cents to $53.83 a barrel.

65,KHC,Kraft Heinz has to settle for marinating Unilever,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Almost nothing made by Kraft Heinz or Unilever has an expiration date of just two days – except, that is, for their $143 billion merger. Kraft, the American ketchup-and-cheese concern controlled by Brazilian investment firm 3G, withdrew an offer to acquire its Anglo-Dutch counterpart on Sunday after an inopportune leak put the knickers of British politicians and unions in a twist. But the idea of pairing 3G’s ruthless cost management with Unilever’s innovative bent won’t easily fade from shareholders’ minds. The premature exposure of Kraft’s bid on Friday morning left the aggressive acquisition machine scrambling to craft an appetizing message for shareholders, the press, Unilever’s rank and file and, perhaps most importantly, British and Dutch leaders - the latter of whom are weeks away from an election. In the post-Brexit era, acquisitions of iconic British firms are receiving extra scrutiny. Prime Minister Theresa May suggested as much in a July speech, referring to an aborted pharmaceuticals merger. So any notion that the producer of beloved English brands such as Marmite yeast spread, Lipton tea and Colman’s mustard would succumb to the cold-blooded clutches of 3G and the maker of Cheez Whiz was going to cause a stink. Kraft would have needed to plot a major charm offensive, emphasizing Unilever’s culture of driving growth through new products and promising to keep jobs in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. But the deal’s leak put Kraft and its backers, who also include billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, on the back foot. Nonetheless, the logic of the combination made sense to investors in both companies, whose shares surged on the news. Kraft’s focus on zero-based budgeting, in which it reassesses all of its costs annually, has allowed it to squeeze out a 23 percent operating profit margin, far higher than Unilever’s 15 percent. But Unilever has managed to grow its top line, and in attractive emerging markets, in ways that Kraft will need to consider as its scalpel runs out of places to trim costs. Kraft may have lost the first round in its attempt to set the table for the biggest food orgy in the industry’s history. But the maker of A1 Chicago Steakhouse marinades knows a thing or two about letting things marinate and season before serving.

66,KHC,Kraft backs out of Unilever bid after hostile reception,"LONDON (Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co’s (KHC.O) rapid retreat from its surprise $143 billion bid for Unilever (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS) in the face of stiff resistance knocked the Anglo-Dutch company’s shares on Monday as investors assessed the impact of the failed approach. Kraft, which is backed by Warren Buffett and the private equity firm 3G, wanted to buy Unilever as part of its strategy to become a global consumer goods giant by buying competitors and cutting costs and jobs to drive profits. However, the U.S. food group had not factored in Unilever Chief Executive Paul Polman dismissing its offer as having no financial or strategic merit and refusing to come to the table. The vehemence of this response, along with fears of a political backlash, was enough to put off 86-year old Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) has a long-held aversion to making hostile bids, sources told Reuters.   “Kraft didn’t realize how hostile their approach would be perceived,” one source said.      A source close to Kraft said its officials alerted Britain’s Business Secretary Greg Clark in a brief call on Friday soon after it made its approach public. Kraft laid out its plan to create a consumer goods behemoth with headquarters in the United States, Britain and the Netherlands and promised to keep Downing Street informed on any developments. For Kraft, Britain’s response was a major concern after Prime Minister Theresa May signaled she would take a more proactive approach to foreign takeovers, sources told Reuters. May, who had previously singled out Kraft’s 2010 acquisition of another British household name, Cadbury Plc, as an example of a deal that should have been blocked, had indicated her government would want to examine the deal if it went ahead, according to a person familiar with the situation.  However, a spokesman for May said on Monday the government had not been involved in Kraft’s decision to pull its proposal. “The issue of the withdrawal from the Unilever deal by Kraft is an issue you should put to Kraft. Number 10 wasn’t involved in it,” the spokesman told reporters. “The simple fact is that the bid has been withdrawn so I don’t have a view on a bid that doesn’t exist.” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who used to work at Unilever, had also said he would examine what it would mean for the Netherlands in the “positive and the negative” sense. Buffett and 3G Capital’s Jorge Paulo Lemann, which together own almost 51 percent of Kraft, had hoped Unilever would be more receptive to its overture, given their success backing brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev on its 79 billion pound takeover of London-based SABMiller last year.  The SABMiller deal — which ranked as the consumer industry’s biggest-ever merger and the biggest-ever takeover of a UK listed company  — had given Buffett and Lemann the confidence to pursue a bigger and riskier bet, one source said. Unilever’s London-listed shares, which jumped 13 percent to a record high when the bid was made public on Friday, fell 8 percent to give it a market value of 100 billion pounds after Kraft said in a statement on Sunday it had “amicably agreed” to withdraw its proposal. The company’s Dutch listed shares were down 7 percent and     analysts at Macquarie said Unilever’s stock should not give up all its gains following the approach, although some shareholders thought that another deal was unlikely. “Unilever’s share price is still performing remarkably well as I suppose the argument that these stocks were cheap versus borrowing costs is still valid,” a shareholder with one of the biggest 20 holdings in Unilever stock told Reuters. “A takeover at a later stage seems unlikely to me as Unilever will build their defense and sharpen their focus on profitability,” the shareholder added. A combination of the two firms would have been the largest acquisition of a UK-based company, Thomson Reuters data showed and would have brought together some of the world’s best known brands, from toothpaste to ice creams. While it would also have combined Kraft’s strength in the United States with Unilever’s in Europe and Asia, it would also have faced a potentially huge cultural clash. In 2013, 3G, which made its name in corporate America by orchestrating large debt-laden acquisitions and then slashing costs, teamed up with billionaire investor Buffett to acquire Heinz and then bought Kraft two years later.  Unilever feared that a merger with Kraft risked eroding the value of its brands and could impede its expansion in emerging markets, which requires more investment, people familiar with the company’s thinking said. “It was always going to be a difficult pitch to convince shareholders to relinquish their grip on Unilever, given the expectations for the company to keep churning out resilient growth in the years to come,” George Salmon, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.

67,KHC,Collapse of Kraft-Unilever tie-up extends run of failed mega-deals,"LONDON (Reuters) - Kraft Heinz’s (KHC.O) dropped bid to buy Unilever (ULVR.L) is the third-largest M&A; deal to collapse, according to Thomson Reuters data, adding to a recent run of failures that highlights the appetite for the pursuit of audacious mega-mergers. The abrupt U-turn by U.S. foods giant Kraft at the weekend pushed the value of deals withdrawn this year to $205.2 billion, compared with $53.6 billion at the same point in 2016. The effect of proposed big deals on those numbers is clear, with the 87 deals to have collapsed this year significantly lower than the 111 that fell through in the corresponding period last year. The value of failed deals is likely to continue, bankers say, with companies still likely to seek ambitious acquisitions.  “There has been no punishment by the market or investors if a deal does not close. The overall context has been shareholder support for trying to get deals done and that has been an engine of growth in the M&A; market,” said Severin Brizay, head of M&A; for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Swiss bank UBS (UBSG.S) Kraft had pursued Unilever as part of its strategy to become a global consumer goods giant, but it received a hostile reception from the Anglo-Dutch company and cited a lack of “strategic” merit for its withdrawal from a deal that would have had a value of $162.2 billion based on the offer price plus Unilever’s debt. Yet the complexity of such huge deals can throw up multiple obstacles. The biggest withdrawn deal came last April when U.S. drugmaker Pfizer’s (PFE.N) attempt to buy Ireland-based Allergan  (AGN.N) for $160 billion floundered on the introduction of U.S. Treasury rules to curb tax-cutting inversion deals. Honeywell International’s (HON.N) attempt to buy United Technologies for $90.7 billion ended in failure last February after United Tech rejected the deal on expectations that it would be blocked by antitrust regulators.  Those helped to lift the value of withdrawn deals last year to an eight-year high, with transactions worth $808 billion withdrawn or rejected, compared with $538 billion in 2015.  Another to fall by the wayside on competition concerns was the proposed $6.3 billion merger of office supply chain Staples SPLS.O with smaller rival Office Depot (ODP.O). “When you are No.1 and No.2 in your sector it’s difficult for the regulator to approve,” said Raj Karia, of global corporate and financial law firm Norton Rose Fulbright. Thomson Reuters classifies a deal as withdrawn if there is a public announcement by the buyer that the offer is withdrawn or financial and legal advisers agree that it has been withdrawn.

68,KHC,3G chews over next big move with side of nuggets,"DALLAS (Reuters Breakingviews) - The power behind the Burger King throne wants an extra side of nuggets. Fresh from withdrawing Kraft Heinz’s $143 billion bid for Unilever over the weekend, investment firm 3G Capital’s restaurant roll-up pounced on fried-chicken chain Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. Restaurant Brands International is offering $1.8 billion for the maker of the Bonafide Chicken meal, a 27 percent premium to the undisturbed price. The deal gives the Brazilian founders of 3G a savory snack while they settle on another big deal for Kraft Heinz. The fast-food business has become more challenging over the last several years as newer entrants like Shake Shack and Five Guys and online ordering outlets threaten the market share of traditional drive-thrus. Chains also compete ruthlessly on price. In 2015, for example, Wendy’s launched a campaign to offer a bacon cheeseburger, nuggets, fries and a drink for just $4. These secular dynamics make Restaurant Brands’ performance all the more impressive. Not only has the $13 billion group created by the merger of Burger King and Tim Hortons been able to grow revenue, albeit slightly, it has substantially trimmed the corporate fat. EBITDA in 2016 added up to roughly 45 cents for every $1 item on the menu, versus about half that for the rest of the industry, and a better margin versus the previous year. It’s an impressive cost squeeze considering fast-food chains have a limited amount of pricing power. Popeyes is a logical target for Restaurant Brands, which is why its shareholders added some $1 billion to its market value on the takeover announcement. Though Popeyes’ EBITDA margin is better than the industry’s, at around 37 percent, it offers Restaurant Brands room for improvement. Sales are also increasing - up 4 percent in the first three quarters of last year - and analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect growth to continue. As Restaurant Brands does its margin work on Popeyes, the extra juice flows straight to the bottom line. Restaurant Brands could find plenty of other nibbles that have similar deal prospects. Wendy’s, Bojangles’ and Jack in the Box are all of similarly digestible sizes and have room for expense management. Even the mighty McDonald’s still holds just around 16 percent of the overall U.S. fast-food market share, according to most recent estimates from Euromonitor. That’s a number 3G has ample room to shoot for.",2212017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-popeyes-m-a-breakingviews/3g-chews-over-next-big-move-with-side-of-nuggets-idUSKBN1602IF

One in every six stocks on the S&P; 500 hit a new 52-week high as a rally sparked by President Donald Trump’s promise of tax reforms shows no sign of fading despite concerns around valuations. “There is no doubt in anyone’s mind that the market has become over extended and is due for a pullback,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. “That said, when you have this kind of momentum, it is very hard to sit on the sidelines.” In the one month of Trump’s presidency, the S&P; 500 hit record intraday highs 10 times, gained 3.9 percent and surpassed $20 trillion in market capitalization. Robust earnings have added to the momentum. Overall profit for S&P; 500 companies is estimated to have risen 7.5 percent in the latest quarter - the biggest rise since the fourth quarter of 2014. Wal-Mart’s shares provided the biggest boost to the Dow, rising 4 percent after the company reported higher-than-expected U.S. sales.

73,KHC,RPT-DEALTALK-Kraft's failed Unilever bid shows it needs growth over cost cuts,"(Repeats Monday story with no changes to text) By Lauren Hirsch Feb 20 (Reuters) - Acquire, slash costs, repeat. Billionaire investor Warren Buffet and buyout firm 3G Capital’s failed $143 billion bid to combine their food conglomerate Kraft Heinz Co  with Unilever Plc shows their winning formula now needs a growth boost. Buffett and 3G built Kraft into the world’s fifth-largest food and beverage company through acquisitions followed by a relentless drive to boost profit margins. While this cost cut-driven business model wowed industry observers, it appears to be reaching its limits, with Kraft’s sales stagnating and margins flattening. Kraft’s bid for Unilever was aimed at addressing these challenges. About 60 percent of Unilever’s business is comprised of household products and personal care (HPC) goods, rather than food. Not only would a deal give Kraft plenty of new ground on which to implement its cost-cutting model, it would boost its revenue by allowing it to expand in several emerging markets. Investment bankers and industry analysts now say Kraft is more likely to pursue another company with a big, growing HPC business, rather than a peer in the food sector that would require it to repeat the same M&A; cycle a couple of years later. “Perhaps Kraft will now acquire another medium-sized U.S. food company, like General Mills Inc, Kellogg Co, or Mondelez International Inc. But after three years this M&A; ‘beast’ will need to be fed once again, and the number of attractive U.S. targets is getting smaller,” Sanford C. Bernstein analysts wrote in a note on Monday. Kraft declined to comment on which company it may seek to acquire next. Investors are already adjusting their bets. Shares of Unilever peers Colgate-Palmolive Co, Clorox Co and Church & Dwight Co Inc rose 4.3 percent, 2.8 percent and 1.6 percent on Friday, respectively, on hopes of them being acquisition targets. Conversely, shares of General Mills, Kellogg and Mondelez dropped 3.8 percent, 2.4 percent, and 1.6 percent on Friday, respectively, as investors saw the chances of them being acquisitions targets for Kraft decreasing. What is more, some of the food companies have been strengthening their takeover defenses by seeking to do themselves what Kraft would have otherwise done to them.  Mondelez spent a portion of its latest quarterly earnings call boasting about its cost-cutting initiatives, while Kellogg recently made changes to its distribution model to cut costs even more. Another reason Kraft is seeking to diversify its business is that consumers have themselves been gradually changing their diet, becoming more health conscious and moving away from the processed and sugar-rich foods that account for much of Kraft’s offerings. To address this, Kraft would need to spend top dollar on inventing and marketing new food brands, which requires expertise not developed by its reliance on acquisitions. Moving into HPC, particularly by acquiring a global company that would help it diversify its U.S.-focused business, now looks like a more attractive option. To be sure, Kraft would need to overcome the same hurdles that resulted in it being spurned by Unilever. Under the stewardship of 3G, Kraft has developed a reputation for extreme cost cuts that risk hurting a company’s top line by stifling investment in innovation and marketing. Indeed, Unilever’s rejection of Kraft’s bid was not just based on price considerations. The company feared that a merger with Kraft risked eroding the value of its brands and could impede its expansion in emerging markets, which requires more investment, people familiar with the company’s thinking told Reuters on Sunday. After 3G teamed up with Buffett to buy Heinz in 2013, they closed six factories and cut 7,000 jobs in 18 months. Operating margins jumped from 18 percent to 26 percent, thanks to their zero-based budgeting, which dictates that managers must meticulously justify all expenses, from pencils to forklifts. But now Kraft’s top line is struggling. Sales were down 3.8 percent at $6.86 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Kraft has attributed the decline in sales to a pruning of its portfolio, as it weeds out non-profitable products. Unless Kraft can shed this image as a relentless cost-cutter, it could face similar opposition from other acquisition targets, particularly if it uses its stock as currency, thereby giving shareholders of the target exposure to the combined company. Last week, two days before it unveiled its acquisition offer for Unilever, Kraft appeared to acknowledge that investors were concerned about its lack of new investment, stating it was focused on innovation and marketing. “We will focus our investments in innovation, renovation and marketing on our leading brands,” Kraft Chief Executive Bernardo Vieira Hees said during the company’s latest quarterly earnings call on Wednesday.

The biggest withdrawn deal came last April when U.S. drugmaker Pfizer’s attempt to buy Ireland-based Allergan  for $160 billion floundered on the introduction of U.S. Treasury rules to curb tax-cutting inversion deals. Honeywell International’s attempt to buy United Technologies for $90.7 billion ended in failure last February after United Tech rejected the deal on expectations that it would be blocked by antitrust regulators. Those helped to lift the value of withdrawn deals last year to an eight-year high, with transactions worth $808 billion withdrawn or rejected, compared with $538 billion in 2015. Another to fall by the wayside on competition concerns was the proposed $6.3 billion merger of office supply chain Staples  with smaller rival Office Depot. “When you are No.1 and No.2 in your sector it’s difficult for the regulator to approve,” said Raj Karia, of global corporate and financial law firm Norton Rose Fulbright. Thomson Reuters classifies a deal as withdrawn if there is a public announcement by the buyer that the offer is withdrawn or financial and legal advisers agree that it has been withdrawn.

76,KHC,Unilever spurred into speedy value review by Kraft bid," LONDON (Reuters) - Unilever (ULVR.L) sought to show shareholders it can go it alone on Wednesday after rejecting Kraft Heinz’s (KHC.O) $143 billion bid, with the promise of a swift, far-reaching review.  This should be completed by early April and could lead to asset sales and cost cuts, a source close to the Anglo-Dutch company said only days after it roundly dismissed Kraft’s approach as without financial or strategic merit.  ""The events of the last week have highlighted the need to capture more quickly the value we see in Unilever,"" the ice cream-to-shampoo producer said in a statement announcing the ""comprehensive"" review of the business.  The board-led review would include possible mergers or acquisitions and a spin-off of the group’s food business would not be excluded, the source close to Unilever said.  Shares in Unilever, which had hit record highs on Friday when Kraft’s approach became public, rose 3 percent. This recouped some of the losses that followed Kraft’s retreat on Sunday, but was still below the $50 offer price.  Kraft, backed by Warren Buffett and private equity firm 3G, had wanted to buy Unilever, which is being advised by Centerview following the approach, as part of its strategy of buying competitors and cutting costs to drive profits.  Unilever’s own profitability has been under scrutiny following weakness in some of the emerging markets where it has developed a strong presence and the group responded on Wednesday by saying it expected its 2017 core operating margin to be towards the upper end of its 40-80 basis points guidance.  Under its Dutch chief executive Paul Polman, Unilever has extolled the virtues of organic growth and focused on “sustainability”, but since it rejected Kraft’s proposal some shareholders have asked why it spurned the bid and called on the company for reassurance over its growth plans.  Others fund managers are more supportive, including Ketan Patel of EdenTree Investment Management who said:  “As long-term shareholders we welcome the decision by Unilever to reject the bid by Kraft Heinz, which offers very little financial incentive and poses a threat to the sustainability focused business model developed by Unilever’s CEO, Paul Polman, since he took over in 2009.”  The review is likely to look at the firm’s cost base and its structure, including whether there is an advantage in producing food and personal and home care products.  Top of the shopping list for any spin-off could be Unilever’s foods business, a second source told Reuters, although a top-30 Unilever shareholder said that would not be an easy fix to the growth conundrum in household and personal care.  “There are some that argue that a sale of some or all food assets is on the cards in exchange for a larger deal in HPC.

81,KHC,Kraft's shock bid triggers Unilever focus on short-term value,"(Reuters) - Kraft Heinz’s (KHC.O) bid has jolted Unilever (ULVR.L) into focusing more on delivering on its strategy in the short-term, the Anglo-Dutch company’s finance chief said on Friday. Graeme Pitkethly said Kraft’s offer had highlighted the importance of achieving a balance between long-term sustainable value, which it had prioritized, and short-term delivery. “This has certainly been a trigger moment for Unilever, and we will not waste it,” he said at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference in Boca Raton, Florida, in a presentation streamed on its website. The U.S. company walked away from a fight with Unilever on Sunday, just two days after its $143 billion bid - and Unilever’s rejection - was made public. Kraft, which is backed by Warren Buffett and the private equity firm 3G, wanted to buy Unilever as part of its strategy to become a leading consumer goods giant by buying competitors and cutting costs and jobs to drive profits.  The approach caused Unilever, which makes OMO detergent and Magnum ice cream, to announce a far-reaching review on Wednesday, seeking to show shareholders it could realize the value spotted by its rival. Pitkethly said he believed Unilever could do more to communicate the value buried within its existing plans, while the review would look at options for the group’s portfolio, organization, cost structures, balance sheet and use of cash.  He said Kraft had taken advantage of a recent widening gap between Unilever’s share price and the sector average, caused in part by a weak outlook for markets like India and Brazil.  “The combination of being at the bottom of the emerging market cycle combined with a lack of volume growth in the fourth quarter led to a very weak Unilever share price,” he said. “Add to this that we were at the bottom of credit cycle and our own strong balance sheet, and you have the opportunity for a leveraged offer.” Unilever, which has struggled recently amid slowing growth and currency fluctuations, saw its shares tumble 4.5 percent on Jan. 26, its worst day in nearly a year, when the company reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter sales.  Kraft seized the opportunity to make an approach pitched at $50 a share, representing a premium of 18 percent. Pitkethly said for most of the last year, a $50-a-share bid would have represented a premium of about 10 percent. Unilever’s shares jumped to an all-time high of 38.48 pounds when the approach was made public, and they have retained most of that gain, supported by Unilever’s review and an upgrade to its guidance. The shares were trading up 0.2 percent at 37.73 pounds  ($47.14) at 1534 GMT on Friday. Pitkethly said the bid “substantially undervalued” Unilever, while Kraft’s approach to shareholder value was diametrically opposed to its own.  While Unilever had an “inherently sustainable” model of  looking to grow by compounding returns and investment over the long term, Kraft, he said, relied on leverage to generate stronger short-term growth and earnings. But without the foundation of strong organic growth, Kraft would be dependent on further deals.      “It may be there was a strong strategic rational for Kraft in combining with Unilever, but there was no strategic rationale for Unilever,” he said.

85,KHC,UPDATE 5-Buffett's Berkshire more than doubled its stake in Apple -CNBC,"(Adds detail about Todd Combs and Ted Weschler in third paragraph) By Sam Forgione NEW YORK, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett told CNBC on Monday his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc had more than doubled its stake in Apple Inc.  since the end of 2016, making it one of Berkshire’s biggest equity holdings, and that U.S. stocks overall were not in “bubble territory.” “Apple strikes me as having quite a sticky product and an enormously useful product to people that use it, not that I do,” said Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway. He said Berkshire’s Apple stake, currently at about 133 million shares, was worth about $18 billion based on Friday’s closing price and amounted to Berkshire’s second-biggest holding. At the end of Dec. 31, Berkshire had held 61.2 million shares for a total of $6.75 billion, according to regulatory filings. Buffett said his ambitious move into Apple shares was piggybacking on the initial investment made by Buffett’s deputy investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook had done a “terrific job,” Buffett said, but added he had not bought shares since the company’s earnings report. Buffett, 86, who told the cable television network that Berkshire had spent about $20 billion on stocks since just before the Nov. 8 U.S. election, also said the U.S. stock market was cheap with interest rates at current levels. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last yielded 2.333 percent in morning U.S. trading. Buffett said it was extremely difficult to attempt to find a floor in stock prices and that he did not know what would happen in the near term in the equity market. He said U.S. shares could conceivably “go down 20 percent tomorrow.” Buffett said Berkshire’s positions in airlines remained unchanged. He said pricing shares of airlines has historically been a “very tough game” and he had never met the chief executives of the four airlines in which Berkshire holds stakes. Berkshire reported a $9.3 billion airline stake at the end of Dec. 31, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, with investments topping $2.1 billion in each of American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc , Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc. Buffett, who was a vocal supporter of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, said he would judge U.S. President Donald Trump based on how safe the country is in four years. He said he would also judge the Republican president according to how the U.S. economy performs overall and how wide participation in a better economy extends. Despite his disagreement with some of Trump’s policies, Buffett said the U.S. economy would be better off in four years under any president. He said that U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made “a lot of sense.” On Kraft Heinz’s snubbed bid for Unilever, Buffett said it was never intended to be a hostile offer and that there was not a “backup deal.” Berkshire is a key investor in Kraft Heinz. “Will there be another deal at Kraft Heinz some day? My guess is yes, but who knows when, I mean, there’s no backup deal, and again, it would have to be friendly and frankly, the prices in that field make it very, very, very tough to make an intelligent deal.” Asked about Berkshire’s $86 billion cash pile, he said the conglomerate was “always looking” for acquisitions but that there was “nothing close.” Buffett said it was enormously important for the U.S. economy to have 30-year government-guaranteed mortgages, but that mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  were not necessary in order to accomplish that. On 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, Buffett said: “It absolutely baffles me who buys the 30-year bond” and that doing so was not sensible at current yields. U.S. 30-year government bonds  last yielded 2.964 percent. Buffett reiterated that Americans are better off buying plain-vanilla index funds than committing money to active managers. He added that the hedge fund industry’s standard fee structure of 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of investment gains “borders on obscene.” In an annual letter to shareholders on Saturday, Buffett slammed fee-hungry investment managers: “When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients.” Buffett praised Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos as possibly the best manager he had ever seen and said Berkshire “missed big time” by not purchasing Amazon shares early on. He said the U.S. economy was doing “terrific,” even at just 2 percent growth per year.

86,KHC,"FTSE ends higher on some positive earnings, insurers slip","(ADVISORY- Follow European and UK stock markets in real time on the Reuters Live Markets blog on Eikon, see cpurl://apps.cp./cms/?pageId=livemarkets) * FTSE 100 index finishes up 0.1 pct * Weak sterling supports index * Motor insurers hit by rate change By Helen Reid LONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index closed slightly higher on Monday, helped by earnings updates and weak sterling, although motor insurers were hit by a regulatory change that could lead to higher payouts. The broader market was helped by sterling, which fell after  talk of another possible Scottish independence vote added to fears about Britain’s future as it prepares to leave the European Union. A weaker pound often helps the blue-chip FTSE 100, because the index is dominated by globally focused firms. The benchmark index finished 0.1 percent higher and was set to end the month up more than 2 percent, after retreating last month. Companies such as Unilever, Bunzl and Convatec were among the top gainers. Business supplies firm Bunzl posted better-than-expected results, boosting it to the top of the FTSE, up 3.4 percent. Convatec, the medical supplies company, was up 1 percent. Unilever was up 1.5 percent. Near Friday’s close Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said the Kraft Heinz bid had been a “trigger moment” for Unilever to focus more on short-term value creation. However, motor insurers came under pressure, with shares in Admiral and Direct Line falling 2.5 percent and 7.2 percent respectively. They were hit by the government’s reduction of a rate which discounts certain large motor claims. The Ministry of Justice cut the discount rate to minus 0.75 percent from 2.5 percent . “We expect today’s change to lead to premium price increases, in addition to those required to pass on ongoing non-bodily injury claims inflation,” UBS analysts said in a note. Direct Line said it expected profit before tax to fall by 215 million to 230 million pounds. Consultancy PwC said the rate change would add 50 to 75 pounds to the average motor insurance policy. London Stock Exchange also fell after its plans to merge with Deutsche Boerse faltered. LSE said it believed the European Commission is unlikely to clear the merger with its German peer. LSE shares finished 3.2 percent lower. RBS was down 1.1 percent, maintaining Friday’s move down after the bank’s results disappointed. Retailer ABF , which owns discount fashion brand Primark, fell 0.9 percent after its results. “Primark’s subdued like-for-like and upcoming margin headwinds are unlikely to prove conducive to continued near-term valuation rebuild,” said Jefferies analysts, who have a ‘hold’ rating on the stock.

87,KHC,Buffett says no backup deal for Kraft after Unilever snub - CNBC,"LONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - U.S. food company Kraft Heinz  is not targeting any other large deals for now after being snubbed by Unilever because valuations in the sector are too high, major shareholder Warren Buffett told CNBC news on Monday. “There isn’t any back-up deal. That was the only one that certainly I seriously thought about that made sense,” the billionaire investor told the cable television network. “Will there be another deal at Kraft Heinz someday? My guess is yes, but who knows when ... it would have to be friendly and frankly, the prices in that field make it very, very, very tough to make an intelligent deal,” Buffett said in a wide-ranging interview at a gathering in his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway , and private equity firm 3G Capital together own 50.9 percent of Kraft. They built the company into the world’s fifth-largest food and drinks firm through acquisitions and a relentless drive to boost profits through aggressive cost cuts. But with sales stagnating and margins flattening, analysts and investors have been expecting another major deal to reignite growth, though its choice of Anglo-Dutch consumer goods firm Unilever came as a surprise. Kraft Heinz withdrew its offer for Unilever on Feb. 19, two days after it disclosed the proposal following reports about an approach for the maker of Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream. “When I was called by a representative of Unilever on Saturday, I said ‘if this is regarded as hostile or unfriendly, you don’t have to worry about it, there isn’t any offer’,” he said, stressing that Kraft never intended to go hostile. He said Alex Behring, managing partner of 3G Capital and Kraft chairman, met Unilever Chief Executive Paul Polman in London on two occasions and presented a letter outlining a plan to create a global consumer goods giant at the end of the second visit after interpreting Polman’s initial response as “neutral”. “Alex took it as a maybe and gave this letter outlining a deal to Unilever,” Buffett said in the interview, noting that once he, Behring and 3G’s co-founder Jorge Paulo Lemann understood Unilever was against a deal, they dropped it. “Once the three of us learned that it was regarded as unfriendly, we had no intention of making one and I think the Unilever people understand that now,” Buffett said.

The FTSE was up 0.2 percent by 0940 GMT. It was set to end the month 2.2 percent higher, after having retreated last month. Sterling fell to a 12-day low, supporting the foreign-currency earning index higher. Admiral and Direct Line were top fallers on the index, down 4.5 to 7.4 percent. The motor insurers were hit by the government’s reduction of a rate which discounts certain large motor claims. The Ministry of Justice cut the discount rate to minus 0.75 percent from 2.5 percent. “We expect today’s change to lead to premium price increases, in addition to those required to pass on ongoing non-bodily injury claims inflation,” UBS analysts said in a note. Direct Line said it expected profit before tax to fall by 215-230 million pounds. Consultancy PwC said the rate change would add 50 to 75 pounds to the average motor insurance policy. Direct Line was headed for its worst day since June, while Admiral was experiencing its heaviest losses since August. Insurer Aviva was also down 1.1 percent. London Stock Exchange was a top faller after its plans to merge with Deutsche Boerse faltered. LSE said it believed the European Commission is unlikely to provide clearance for the merger with its German peer. LSE shares were down 3.2 percent, headed for their worst day since the Brexit referendum aftermath in June. RBS was down 1.8 percent, maintaining Friday’s move down after the bank’s results disappointed. Outweighing the moves lower were steady gains led by Bunzl, Convatec and Unilever. Business supplies firm Bunzl posted better-than-expected results, boosting it to the top of the FTSE, up 2.3 percent.  Convatec, the medical supplies company, was also up 1.6 percent. Unilever was gaining 1.5 percent.

On the mid-cap index, bus operator National Express was a top gainer, hitting a four-month high after Liberum, a top-rated analyst for the stock, upgraded it to ‘buy’ from ‘hold’, citing diversification within public transport operations as a positive for the company. Premier Oil was the top gainer in the small-cap index, up 10.9 percent. The oil company said it was making progress over refinancing, in an update just before the close on Friday.

89,KHC,Unilever seeks changes to pay to give managers owner's mindset,"LONDON (Reuters) - Unilever (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS) is proposing changes to how it pays executives and directors in order to make them think more like owners of the business, less than two weeks after seeing off a $143 billion takeover pursuit by U.S. rival Kraft Heinz (KHC.O). Combining a greater emphasis on long-term employee share ownership and personal commitment, the changes were announced in Unilever’s annual report for 2016 on Tuesday. If approved by shareholders at Unilever’s annual general meetings in April, they would apply for three years. The Anglo-Dutch maker of Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream is under pressure to prove it can deliver growth on its own following its unequivocal rejection of Kraft’s proposal earlier this month. Unilever is now conducting a far-reaching review of its business that should be finished by early April. This will focus more squarely on short-term delivery, it has said. “In the immediate future, we are fully engaged in the recently announced comprehensive review of options available to accelerate delivery of value for the benefit of our shareholders,” Chairman Marijn Dekkers said in the annual report, without giving more detail.  As part of a new remuneration plan, Unilever said senior executives below the board level would be the first to feel the changes, which involve simplifying compensation by consolidating fixed pay into a single figure and discontinuing one of its long-term incentive plans.  The remaining “management co-investment plan” will see its performance horizon expanded from three years to four.  Managers would be encouraged to invest a proportion of their annual bonuses in Unilever shares through that plan, and would be able to invest their whole bonus. The plan’s performance measures have also been amended to more closely align with Unilever’s business strategy.  Unilever said it also aims, in due course, to apply the new framework to executive directors, though there will be increased shareholding requirements in 2017 for Chief Executive Paul Polman and Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly.  Unilever, with dual headquarters in Britain and the Netherlands, also said it plans to extend its executive share incentives from 3,000 senior managers to all of its 15,000-plus managers worldwide from 2018.  “Through these initiatives we will encourage all our employees fully to adopt an owner’s mindset with the goal of achieving our growth ambition,” Ann Fudge, head of its compensation committee, said.        For 2016, CEO Polman received a compensation package worth 8.4 million euros, including a base salary of 1.2 million euros, annual bonus of 2.3 million and long-term incentives worth 3.8 million. That is down from 10.3 million euros in 2015.  Unilever’s group sales growth slowed to 3.7 percent in 2016 from 4.1 percent in 2015, hurt by demonetization in India and an economic crisis in Brazil.

94,KHC,RPT-UPDATE 5-Buffett's Berkshire more than doubled its stake in Apple -CNBC,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - (Repeats February 27 story with no change to text following corrections for previous stories in this series.) Billionaire investor Warren Buffett told CNBC on Monday his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc had more than doubled its stake in Apple Inc. since the end of 2016, making it one of Berkshire’s biggest equity holdings, and that U.S. stocks overall were not in “bubble territory.”  “Apple strikes me as having quite a sticky product and an enormously useful product to people that use it, not that I do,” said Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway. He said Berkshire’s Apple stake, currently at about 133 million shares, was worth about $18 billion based on Friday’s closing price and amounted to Berkshire’s second-biggest holding. At the end of Dec. 31, Berkshire had held 61.2 million shares for a total of $6.75 billion, according to regulatory filings. Buffett said his ambitious move into Apple shares was piggybacking on the initial investment made by Buffett’s deputy investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook had done a “terrific job,” Buffett said, but added he had not bought shares since the company’s earnings report.  Buffett, 86, who told the cable television network that Berkshire had spent about $20 billion on stocks since just before the Nov. 8 U.S. election, also said the U.S. stock market was cheap with interest rates at current levels.  Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last yielded 2.333 percent in morning U.S. trading.  Buffett said it was extremely difficult to attempt to find a floor in stock prices and that he did not know what would happen in the near term in the equity market.  He said U.S. shares could conceivably “go down 20 percent tomorrow.” Buffett said Berkshire’s positions in airlines remained unchanged. He said pricing shares of airlines has historically been a “very tough game” and he had never met the chief executives of the four airlines in which Berkshire holds stakes.  Berkshire reported a $9.3 billion airline stake at the end of Dec. 31, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, with investments topping $2.1 billion in each of American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc. Buffett, who was a vocal supporter of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, said he would judge U.S. President Donald Trump based on how safe the country is in four years. He said he would also judge the Republican president according to how the U.S. economy performs overall and how wide participation in a better economy extends.  Despite his disagreement with some of Trump’s policies, Buffett said the U.S. economy would be better off in four years under any president. He said that U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made “a lot of sense.”  On Kraft Heinz’s snubbed bid for Unilever, Buffett said it was never intended to be a hostile offer and that there was not a “backup deal.” Berkshire is a key investor in Kraft Heinz. “Will there be another deal at Kraft Heinz some day? My guess is yes, but who knows when, I mean, there’s no backup deal, and again, it would have to be friendly and frankly, the prices in that field make it very, very, very tough to make an intelligent deal.” Asked about Berkshire’s $86 billion cash pile, he said the conglomerate was “always looking” for acquisitions but that there was “nothing close.” Buffett said it was enormously important for the U.S. economy to have 30-year government-guaranteed mortgages, but that mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not necessary in order to accomplish that. On 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, Buffett said: “It absolutely baffles me who buys the 30-year bond” and that doing so was not sensible at current yields. U.S. 30-year government bonds last yielded 2.964 percent.  Buffett reiterated that Americans are better off buying plain-vanilla index funds than committing money to active managers. He added that the hedge fund industry’s standard fee structure of 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of investment gains “borders on obscene.” In an annual letter to shareholders on Saturday, Buffett slammed fee-hungry investment managers: “When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients.” Buffett praised Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos as possibly the best manager he had ever seen and said Berkshire “missed big time” by not purchasing Amazon shares early on.  He said the U.S. economy was doing “terrific,” even at just 2 percent growth per year.

96,KHC,Unilever CEO urges UK to provide 'level playing field' after Kraft bid,"LONDON (Reuters) - Fresh from defending Unilever (ULVR.L) against an unsolicited $143 billion takeover attempt by Kraft Heinz (KHC.O), CEO Paul Polman said the British government should ensure a level playing field for target companies. “We’re not talking about protection; we are saying that when you have a situation like this, with a national champion, there should be a level playing field,” Polman told Reuters on Tuesday. One key feature of UK takeover rules is that once an expression of interest for a company has been made, suitors have only 28 days in which to make a formal bid, or they must walk away for six months. During those 28 days, the target company is closely monitored by the government’s takeover panel. Unilever, jointly based in Britain and the Netherlands, said target companies should have more time in which to defend themselves. It wants the UK Takeover Code changed to consider the interests of stakeholders beyond shareholders, as is the case in some other countries. Dutch paint company Akzo Nobel (AKZO.AS), for example,  rejected a $22 billion takeover offer last week by larger U.S. rival PPG Industries (PPG.N), saying the unsolicited approach was not in the interest of stakeholders, including its shareholders, customers and employees.  A spokeswoman for the UK government’s Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy said mergers and acquisitions played an important role in driving investment,  growing businesses and keeping UK businesses competitive. “We want the UK to be the best place in the world to invest and do business. This means creating the conditions for British businesses to prosper and grow, both here and on the world stage,” the spokeswoman said in an email. When running for the leadership of the Conservative Party after the June 2016 Brexit vote, Theresa May, then the home secretary, said that the government should be capable of stepping in when a foreign company tried to buy a business that was important to workers and communities. She singled out previous bids by an earlier iteration of Kraft and U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer (PFE.N) to buy British companies. “Because as we saw when Cadbury’s – that great Birmingham company – was bought by Kraft, or when AstraZeneca was almost sold to Pfizer, transient shareholders – who are mostly companies investing other people’s money – are not the only people with an interest when firms are sold or close,” May said at the launch of her campaign to be prime minister. Since then, May has said that she will not pick winners or prop up failing companies, but that Britain should support and promote strategically important industries as other major economies do. Kraft Heinz, headquartered in Pittsburgh and Chicago, walked away from a fight with Unilever last month, just two days after its $143 billion bid - and Unilever’s rejection - was made public. Polman’s comments were earlier reported by the Financial Times.

This means creating the conditions for British businesses to prosper and grow, both here and on the world stage,” the spokeswoman said in an email. When running for the leadership of the Conservative Party after the June 2016 Brexit vote, Theresa May, then the home secretary, said that the government should be capable of stepping in when a foreign company tried to buy a business that was important to workers and communities. She singled out previous bids by an earlier iteration of Kraft and U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer (PFE.N) to buy British companies. “Because as we saw when Cadbury’s – that great Birmingham company – was bought by Kraft, or when AstraZeneca was almost sold to Pfizer, transient shareholders – who are mostly companies investing other people’s money – are not the only people with an interest when firms are sold or close,” May said at the launch of her campaign to be prime minister. Since then, May has said that she will not pick winners or prop up failing companies, but that Britain should support and promote strategically important industries as other major economies do. Kraft Heinz, headquartered in Pittsburgh and Chicago, walked away from a fight with Unilever last month, just two days after its $143 billion bid - and Unilever’s rejection - was made public. Polman’s comments were earlier reported by the Financial Times.

Heinz Co director’s security guard was charged on Wednesday with insider trading in the ketchup maker’s stock and options before Heinz was bought in 2013 by Brazil’s 3G Capital and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N). In a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Todd David Alpert made $43,873 of illegal profit after learning of the proposed Heinz takeover while working as a dispatcher for the director, who sat on Heinz’s board for several years. It was unclear whether Alpert, of Kingston, Pennsylvania, had hired a lawyer, and the defendant could not immediately be reached for comment. The director was not identified in court papers. Heinz’s board had since 2006 included Nelson Peltz, the activist investor. He could not immediately be reached for comment. Berkshire, 3G and the former Heinz director have not been accused of wrongdoing by the SEC. According to the regulator, Alpert had since January 2011 worked for a security company to provide services to the Heinz director and his family, and worked in a security booth at a home for the director where he reported “almost daily.” Public records show a shared historical address for Peltz and Alpert in a northern suburb of New York City. Part of Alpert’s job was to screen emails sent through a secure account, including a “confidential” Jan. 24, 2013 email that contained Berkshire’s and 3G’s offer to buy Heinz for the eventual $72.50 per share takeover price, the SEC said. Alpert began buying Heinz through his broker the next day, purchasing 1,000 shares and 30 call options he sold within two hours of the Feb. 14, 2013 merger announcement, the SEC said. According to the SEC, Alpert’s employment with the security company ended in July 2015, around the time he admitted his trading to the director, and the defendant is now unemployed. The SEC also said Alpert invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination when it questioned him. Berkshire and 3G bought Heinz for about $23 billion.

101,KHC,"Unilever review covers costs, deals, balance sheet -FT","LONDON (Reuters) - Unilever (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS) is considering returning cash to shareholders, making medium-sized acquisitions and more aggressive cost cuts as part of its business review, the Financial Times reported.   The Anglo-Dutch maker of Knorr soups, Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream rebuffed a surprise $143 billion takeover offer from Kraft Heinz (KHC.O) last month.  Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said at a conference the week after the bid was made public that Unilever would review its options including examining its portfolio, organization, cost structures, balance sheet and uses of cash. “We do see it as an inflection point,” Pitkethly said at the conference in Florida.  Unilever declined to comment on possible outcomes of the review, whose results will be announced in April.  Separating the company’s food business from its home and personal care businesses is unlikely, the FT said, citing people close to the company, though it is accelerating efforts to dispose of its struggling spreads division. Unilever is also considering raising its net debt to 2.5 or 3 times earnings before interest, tax and depreciation, from 1 times now, the FT said. At 2.5 times, Unilever would have 29 billion euros to spend by 2020, according to Andrew Wood, analyst at Bernstein, who suggested mid-sized deals such as Reckitt Benckiser’s (RB.L) home business could be a good fit. Unilever’s division heads have been told to review their operations with the aim of boosting shareholder returns, the FT said. The company has already announced a program to save 1 billion euros by 2018.

104,KHC,'Sweet spot' in European M&A; puts floor under valuations,"LONDON (Reuters) - A boom in European deal-making activity — a sign better growth prospects are boosting confidence in European corporate boardrooms — is helping support stock market valuations which, on some measures, appear stretched. A brighter outlook for the global and regional economy, buoyant stock markets and low borrowing costs have underpinned merger and acquisition (M&A;) activity in Europe, which is enjoying its best three-month period since 2007, Reuters calculations show. Moreover, rising share prices of both acquirer and target companies when deals are announced suggest shareholders are willing to back mergers, a shift from recent years when they preferred dividends and cautious spending. “Doing deals in the peak of a market is also unwise as you could end up paying more – so what you want is the sweet spot where companies aren’t trading on very expensive multiples,” said Sharon Bell, a strategist at Goldman Sachs. “We are at that sweet spot now.” European equities trade at just under 15 times forward earnings, slightly above the long-term average of about 14 times. But they are well below peaks seen over the past 15 years, and underpinned by the best earnings outlook for regional companies since 2010. reut.rs/2nrVMW6 The broad sweep of sectors involved in M&A;, from global food and personal goods giants to UK industrials and oil services firms, is also seen as a healthy sign and is spurring a rethink of valuations. “There was nothing for a few years, so all the activity that was bottled up is bubbling up now,” said Goldman Sachs’s Bell.  The surprise $143 billion takeover bid by Warren Buffett-backed Kraft Heinz KFT.O for Unilever (ULVR.L), while rejected, has reset some assumptions about stocks, market participants say. “The size of the proposed transaction was a wake-up call for corporations all over the world - and their investors,” star UK fund manager Nick Train wrote in his latest letter to investors. Shares of large consumer staples companies have lagged the recent stock market rally as investors preferred faster growing sectors in the markets. “Towards the end of last year there was a lot of bearish talk about rich valuations in consumer staples like Unilever,” said Mark Martin, a fund manager at Neptune Investment Management, who manages a portfolio of mid-sized UK companies. “Now you’ve got sensible investors including Buffett still finding as much as 20 percent upside for Unilever,” he said. While the earnings outlook in Europe has brightened significantly from the lackluster growth seen since 2010, both corporate profits and margins remain well below prior peaks and have significantly lagged those in the United States. reut.rs/2553txN Total annual profits for European firms, of about $616 billion, are about half what they were in 2008, according to Thomson Reuters data. reut.rs/2mx3Wrm “While management waits for European earnings to catch up with the U.S., in a much more wholesale growth environment, M&A; is likely,” said Dylan Ball, a portfolio manager Templeton Global Equity Group. Meanwhile, weaker currencies, particularly sterling, have made acquisitions in Europe more tempting for offshore buyers. “U.S. companies with large offshore cash balances and maxed-out stock buy-back programs are looking to take advantage of the U.S. dollar strength,” Ball added.  One group of companies on the radar for investors is UK industrials, on which a combination of Brexit-related worries and exposure to beaten-down oil and mining had dented sentiment. Neptune’s Martin, whose fund has comfortably beaten peers’ performance on a three- and five-year basis, had nearly half his fund in UK industrials at the end of February. Martin, whose fund owns shares in oil services firm Amec Foster Wheeler AMFW.L, which recently agreed to be bought by peer Wood Group (WG.L), said he would back companies buying others in a bid to grow market share. “A lot of companies are doing it (M&A;) to drive down costs. So there isn’t the same euphoric growth-at-all-costs mentality we saw in 2007,” Martin said, playing down concerns over whether a flurry of deal-making is a harbinger of market tops. Instead, investors see the uptick in mergers as a sign of a long-awaited revival of corporate confidence in Europe, which has been hamstrung by worries including sovereign debt crises, sluggish growth and, more recently, political risks. After four years of underperforming developed market peers, European stocks are catching up, with M&A; one more prop to valuations and investor interest. “The wall of worry is being taken down brick by brick,” said Neptune’s Martin.

107,KHC,Hadas: The stakeholder revolution has been delayed,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - For fans of explicitly ethical stakeholder capitalism, Unilever’s rebuttal of a takeover approach by Kraft Heinz last month was a great moment. On one side, a company that made a big deal about thinking long term and creating good products as well as profit for shareholders. On the other, a business run by some of the harshest corporate cost-cutters around. With little more than a few phone calls, the Anglo-Dutch consumer product giant saw off the much smaller competitor. Virtue triumphs over vice. Of course, dividing companies into good and bad is too simple. Unilever is far too big, successful and traditional to be a total paragon. It is, after all, in the business of pushing sometimes unhealthy products to sometimes impressionable consumers. Kraft’s owners have a reputation for slashing costs, but then cutting waste and eliminating chronically unsuccessful lines of business can free up resources for better uses. But Paul Polman, Unilever’s chief executive, has reignited a battle between two philosophies of company ownership. The stakeholder approach says that a company is not really owned by shareholders, or at least not in the same way that an apartment is owned by a landlord. Providers of financial capital have a claim on its gains, but so do providers of labour, land, legal protection and technology. All these parties deserve a fair return – no less, but also no more. The other approach is crude but simple: if companies take care of shareholders, all the rest will fall into place. Proponents of the stakeholder vision say the sharing approach ought to benefit shareholders in the long term. If a crisis comes around, shareholders will be protected by the good will generated from the company’s earlier willingness to aim at much more than maximal short-term profitability. But companies do not always run into crises. And the payoff from being virtuous might take years, or decades – too long for today’s institutional investors, who often struggle to look past the next quarter, let alone thinking two years ahead. As Polman stands for the stakeholder, so Jorge Paulo Lemann is a fitting figurehead for the shareholder-value philosophy. He is the billionaire Brazilian investor behind Kraft Heinz, as well as brewer Anheuser-Busch Inbev. Lemann has certainly done well for shareholders, starting with himself. He has exploited the fact that talk of the long term and serving stakeholders can be a mask for being fat and self-serving. His model has been to acquire businesses, promise large cost savings, and deliver even larger ones. In practice, companies land somewhere in the middle. Unilever is a sponsor of the research and lobby group FCLT – Focusing Capital on the Long Term. But Polman has not endorsed the full version of stakeholder capitalism. He could not afford to even if he is sympathetic, because shareholders are ultimately the ones with the power to turf him out. A genuine stakeholder vision of how a company should be managed would not really be shareholder-friendly. So Unilever’s victory is not necessarily good for shareholders, even in the long term, and the Kraft Heinz approach is not necessarily bad for society, even in the short term. That results in a conflict. McKinsey has found that most managers of companies in the S&P; 500 Index felt the pressure for short-term results has been increasing. And a separate study, also by McKinsey, said that companies that ignored this pressure have done substantially better for shareholders over the last decade. Unilever’s defence against Kraft Heinz suggests that a long-term corporate orientation, often with a hint of stakeholder thinking, is gaining traction. Dutch paint maker Akzo Nobel seems persuaded. It cited the interests of “stakeholders” as one reason for rejecting two bids from American rival PPG Industries. The latest one, at $24 billion, was a generous-seeming 38 percent premium on Akzo’s undisturbed price. Shareholder value alone would have suggested it was worth a more serious hearing. On the other side, Lemann is on a roll. He co-invests with Warren Buffett, the ageing guru investor traditionally associated with very long-term thinking. And while Larry Fink, who runs giant investor BlackRock, backs FCLT, most institutional investors have become even more strongly committed to the narrowest and shortest-term sort of shareholder value. Which side will win? The election of Donald Trump, a businessman who generally ignored every stakeholder but himself, to the presidency of the United States might be a bad omen for the long-term cause. But Theresa May, the British prime minister whose approach to the European Union is as reactionary as the U.S. president’s approach to everything, is a proponent of treating workers as much more than a cost of doing business. A compromise could bring both sides victory. Let stakeholder enthusiasts admit the danger of entrenching self-serving behaviour, while short-termists and shareholder-only investors and managers lengthen and broaden their perspective. Such a consensus on corporate purpose could be vital. If investors and managers do not find an acceptable way forward, alienated voters may impose an unacceptable solution.",3222017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-companies-m-a-breakingviews/hadas-the-stakeholder-revolution-has-been-delayed-idUSKBN16T22A

109,KHC,"Galvanized by Kraft, Unilever keeps shareholders sweet with cash","LONDON (Reuters) - Unilever (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS) promised shareholders a multi-billion euro rewards package on Thursday after February’s $143 billion takeover offer from Kraft Heinz (KHC.O) jolted it into a corporate makeover aimed at proving it can go it alone. The maker of Dove soap and Knorr soup said it would speed up cost savings, sell its shrinking margarines business and decide whether to scrap its dual Anglo-Dutch listing, which Unilever said would make it easier to do big acquisitions. Shareholders, some of whom where unhappy that Unilever so swiftly spurned the approach by U.S. rival Kraft, will also get a 5 billion euros ($5.3 billion) share buyback, the first since 2008, funded in part by a targeted rise in debt levels, and a 12 percent dividend increase this year.  Unilever, one of Europe’s biggest blue-chip stocks, called the Kraft episode a “trigger moment” to deeply review its business, as global packaged goods makers face slowing growth and more competition from start-ups exploiting evolving tastes for natural and healthy products. “There is no doubt that however ... opportunistic it (the Kraft approach) was, it did raise expectations,” Chief Executive Paul Polman said. “We are absolutely determined to use it as an opportunity to place Unilever on an even stronger footing.”  Unilever's London-listed shares, which have held onto the gains made by the Kraft bid as shareholders bet it would spur improved performance, closed up 1 percent at 39.78 pounds, while the FTSE 100 .FTSE was down 0.3 percent. “They’re not stretching here, and nor should they. They’re in a very strong position and this is hopefully a sign they’re going to be a bit leaner and more shareholder-focused,” said GAM fund manager Ali Miremadi, who manages two worldwide equity funds that are 2.5 percent invested in Unilever. Unilever should be able to deliver the premium Kraft was offering or more over the next four or five years, he added.  Unilever set a 20 percent underlying operating margin target for 2020, up from 16.4 percent in 2016, fueled by increased cost savings, which Goldman Sachs analysts said suggested 90 basis points of expansion per year, up from a prior goal of 40 to 80 points. But unlike the previous target, the new one excludes restructuring charges, which are seen totaling 3.5 billion euros over the period.  Unilever is now aiming for 6 billion euros of savings by 2019, up from 4 billion euros and said it would double savings within brand and marketing to 2 billion euros. Goldman, which has a “sell” rating on the shares, worries that reduced marketing spend will hurt sales, but Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said Unilever could cut the number of advertisements it makes by a third and the number of agencies it works with by half with little effect. Much of the improvement would come from combining food, which includes Knorr and Hellmann’s mayonnaise, with the ice cream and tea businesses, following the sale or spin-off of the spreads unit, where sales have fallen for years. Unilever already has interest from private equity firms, who sources estimate may pay some 6 billion euros, but if a sale does not generate enough value it will pursue a spin-off and aims to complete the process by year-end. In another strategic shift, Unilever said it will take on debt equal to 2 times core earnings, whereas its leverage ratio has been below one time for more than half of the past 20 years, Jefferies analysts have said. “Unilever was vulnerable to a takeover exactly because it’s been so free of debt,” said Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital in London. Unilever said the leverage will help it grow.  “We think there will be a lot more action in the M&A; pipeline ... and as ever we look forward to participating very actively,” Pitkethly told Reuters.  While Polman signaled a potential interest in buying French’s mustard and Frank’s RedHot sauce, which are being sold by Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L) and which sources say could fetch a price around $3 billion, Unilever has generally been selling food brands and buying higher-growth home and personal care.  Analysts have long speculated whether Unilever may divest its food business, which makes up some 40 percent of revenue, and do a blockbuster personal care deal. “Colgate (Palmolive) (CL.N) is the stand out option on this front,” Exane BNP analyst Jeff Stent said, adding that Unilever’s comments on Thursday may signal more openness. Colgate has a market valuation of $65 billion and analysts expect a deal would need to be in the area of $90 billion.  Unilever executives said it still made sense to keep its food business, excluding spreads, although they left the door open for big-ticket deals, by touting how much easier they would be if it ditched the dual listings and headquarters in London and Rotterdam, as a single listing would make it easier to spin off businesses and use equity in a share deal. “With the fast changes we see in the market we will see opportunities come and go quicker than they probably did in the past, and we need to be prepared,” Polman said. Unilever will decide by the end of the year whether to combine its dual listing and headquarters, adding that Brexit would not influence its choice.

111,KHC,"UPDATE 5-Galvanised by Kraft, Unilever keeps shareholders sweet with cash","LONDON (Reuters) - Unilever (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS) promised shareholders a multi-billion euro rewards package on Thursday after February’s $143 billion takeover offer from Kraft Heinz (KHC.O) jolted it into a corporate makeover aimed at proving it can go it alone. The maker of Dove soap and Knorr soup said it would speed up cost savings, sell its shrinking margarines business and decide whether to scrap its dual Anglo-Dutch listing, which Unilever said would make it easier to do big acquisitions. Shareholders, some of whom where unhappy that Unilever so swiftly spurned the approach by U.S. rival Kraft, will also get a 5 billion euros ($5.3 billion) share buyback, the first since 2008, funded in part by a targeted rise in debt levels, and a 12 percent dividend increase this year.  Unilever, one of Europe’s biggest blue-chip stocks, called the Kraft episode a “trigger moment” to deeply review its business, as global packaged goods makers face slowing growth and more competition from start-ups exploiting evolving tastes for natural and healthy products. “There is no doubt that however ... opportunistic it (the Kraft approach) was, it did raise expectations,” Chief Executive Paul Polman said. “We are absolutely determined to use it as an opportunity to place Unilever on an even stronger footing.”  Unilever's London-listed shares, which have held onto the gains made by the Kraft bid as shareholders bet it would spur improved performance, closed up 1 percent at 39.78 pounds, while the FTSE 100 .FTSE was down 0.3 percent. “They’re not stretching here, and nor should they. They’re in a very strong position and this is hopefully a sign they’re going to be a bit leaner and more shareholder-focused,” said GAM fund manager Ali Miremadi, who manages two worldwide equity funds that are 2.5 percent invested in Unilever. Unilever should be able to deliver the premium Kraft was offering or more over the next four or five years, he added.  Unilever set a 20 percent underlying operating margin target for 2020, up from 16.4 percent in 2016, fueled by increased cost savings, which Goldman Sachs analysts said suggested 90 basis points of expansion per year, up from a prior goal of 40 to 80 points. But unlike the previous target, the new one excludes restructuring charges, which are seen totaling 3.5 billion euros over the period.  Unilever is now aiming for 6 billion euros of savings by 2019, up from 4 billion euros and said it would double savings within brand and marketing to 2 billion euros. Goldman, which has a “sell” rating on the shares, worries that reduced marketing spend will hurt sales, but Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said Unilever could cut the number of advertisements it makes by a third and the number of agencies it works with by half with little effect. Much of the improvement would come from combining food, which includes Knorr and Hellmann’s mayonnaise, with the ice cream and tea businesses, following the sale or spin-off of the spreads unit, where sales have fallen for years. Unilever already has interest from private equity firms, who sources estimate may pay some 6 billion euros, but if a sale does not generate enough value it will pursue a spin-off and aims to complete the process by year-end. In another strategic shift, Unilever said it will take on debt equal to 2 times core earnings, whereas its leverage ratio has been below one time for more than half of the past 20 years, Jefferies analysts have said. “Unilever was vulnerable to a takeover exactly because it’s been so free of debt,” said Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital in London.

112,KHC,European shares fall as banks hit by cooling rate hike expectations,"* Pan-European STOXX 600 index down 0.3 pct * Banks down after Draghi remarks, real estate up * Unilever inches up after strategy review * Shares off lows as commodity stocks recover (Adds details, updates prices) By Danilo Masoni MILAN, April 6 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Thursday after minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last meeting raised worries over high stock market valuations, with banks hit by cooling ECB rate hike expectations. The STOXX 600 index fell 0.3 percent while Britain’s FTSE and Germany’s DAX both fell 0.4 percent. European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said the bank would stick to its policy plan including bond buying and record-low rates for some time to come as it was not yet convinced the euro zone economy was back to rude health. His remarks, which suggested the ECB will not change its policy message this month, hit banking stocks, which benefit from prospects that higher rates could boost their margins, but lifted the real estate index to a six-month high. “Banks have been suffering from negative newsflow on the rates front with the central bank rapidly becoming more prudent after inflation data resoundingly missed expectations,” said Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia in Milan. “On the other hand, real estate is recovering from worries that rates could start a phase of strong increases.” Among real estate stocks, France’s Unibail Rodamco provided the biggest boost to the sectoral index with a rise of 1.1 percent. Among euro zone banks, the top two fallers were Italy’s Banco BPM and Germany’s Commerzbank, both down 1.6 percent. Deutsche Bank fell 1 percent on the last day to subscribe to its 8 billion euros cash call. Anthilia’s Sersale added that broader risk-off mood was also due to profit-taking after a strong gain in March and a reversal at Wall Street following the release of the Fed minutes overnight. Unilever edged up 0.2 percent after the consumer goods giant promised a multi-billion pound programme of shareholder rewards after a corporate rethink sparked by a takeover approach from Kraft Heinz. Eslewhere broker upgrades drove price action. Pearson  was the top loser on the STOXX, down 8.7 percent, as the British education firm traded ex-dividend and was further weighed down by a downgrade from Exane to underperform. AstraZeneca fell 1.3 percent after a UBS downgrade to neutral, while German airport operator Fraport rose 2.9 percent with traders linking the rise to a upgrade to “buy” from Societe Generale.

116,KHC,Unilever picks Morgan Stanley and Goldman to sell spreads business- sources,"LONDON, April 13 (Reuters) - Anglo-Dutch consumer group Unilever has decided to work with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs on the sale of its margarine and spreads business, which was announced last week, sources told Reuters on Thursday. The sale, which could fetch as much as 6 billion pounds ($7.52 billion), is expected to kick off later this year, the sources said, following a far-reaching review of Unilever’s business prompted by February’s unsolicited $143 billion takeover offer from Kraft Heinz. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are mainly targeting private equity bidders which could team up in large consortia to finance the bid, said the sources, who declined to be identified as the process is private. Unilever and Morgan Stanley declined to comment while Goldman Sachs was not immediately available to comment. Goldman and Morgan Stanley have both worked with Unilever on deals in the past. Morgan Stanley worked on Unilever’s defence against Kraft.

117,KHC,UPDATE 2-Sales beat boosts Unilever's argument to go it alone,"LONDON (Reuters) - Unilever (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS) reported a surprise pick up in quarterly sales growth on Thursday, boosting its argument that it can improve performance on its own after spurning a $143 billion takeover offer from Kraft Heinz (KHC.O) in February. The maker of Knorr soups and Dove soap, which earlier this month announced a business revamp in response to the takeover interest, said improving economies and rising commodity costs  helped it to lift prices in the first quarter. That offset a small dip in the volume of goods sold.  Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said there was always a delay between economic improvements and a pick up in household spending and so Unilever expected a better performance in the second half of the year, helped also by its own easier year-on-year comparisons. “We are seeing positive signs in the economy overall,” he told Reuters, talking about a “bottoming out” of currency devaluations in places such as India, Indonesia and Brazil. Unilever’s underlying sales growth of 2.9 percent topped analysts’ expectations of 2.0 percent and 2.2 percent growth in the fourth quarter of 2016. Growth was led by emerging markets, while pricing added 3 percent and the dip in volumes took off 0.1 percent.  The results, which outshone those of rival Nestle (NESN.S),  sent Unilever’s shares up 1.5 percent to 39.94 pounds, leaving them more than 19 percent higher than before Kraft’s unsolicited, and swiftly rejected, offer. Nestle, the world’s largest packaged food company, posted sales growth of only 2.3 percent. Compared with Unilever, Nestle has much more exposure to the shrinking North American packaged food market, where a late Easter and one less trading day in the quarter compounded weakness due to changing consumer tastes and intense competition.    Even at Unilever, food was the weakest division, coming in flat, whereas the ice cream and tea business rose 5.4 percent and home and personal care products rose 3.4 percent.   Excluding the margarine and spreads business, which is to be sold, Unilever’s group underlying sales would have risen 3.4 percent. Pitkethly said it was “a bit of a relief” to be able to finally “engage wholeheartedly” with private equity suitors which have been circling the unit for some time.  In a statement, Chief Executive Paul Polman said the results reconfirmed the strength of Unilever’s business model.   To appease investors, some of which were disappointed by the company’s refusal to engage in takeover talks, Unilever announced plans this month aimed at lifting shareholder returns. It said it aimed to cut more costs, boost margins, buy back shares, increase the dividend, sell or spin off its margarine business, combine its remaining food businesses into one unit and review its dual Anglo-Dutch structure. “For Unilever, the future starts here,” said Steve Clayton, fund manager of the Hargreaves Lansdown Select equity funds. “Their commitment to stronger capital and income returns to shareholders from a reinvigorated portfolio is hugely welcome.” With portfolio weightings nearing 5 percent, Unilever is the largest position in the two funds Clayton manages, which together account for 505 million pounds.  Unilever’s turnover rose 6.1 percent to 13.3 billion euros ($14 billion) in the first quarter, including a foreign exchange boost of 2.4 percent.  The company reiterated this month’s forecast for 2017 sales growth of 3-5 percent, with margins growing at least 80 basis points and a dividend increase of 12 percent.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.3 percent by 0730GMT. The UK’s FTSE 100 was down 0.1 percent. Banks were the top sectoral gainers for a second consecutive session, up 0.6 percent. UBS on Wednesday upgraded European banks to ‘neutral’ from ‘underweight’, citing rising reflation expectations and a seemingly more benign regulatory environment. Unilever helped drive UK and European benchmarks, after the consumer sector bellwether posted a first-quarter sales beat, helped by price increases. The gains by Unilever, which earlier this year rejected a hostile takeover bid by U.S. firm Kraft Heinz, supported the personal and household goods sector which rose up 0.4 percent. “Margins are where it really counts for Unilever as it tries to shore up its defences against another bidder who can promise higher margins and better return on equity,” said ETX Capital analyst Neil Wilson. “Unilever is aiming at an underlying operating margin of 20 percent by 2020, underpinned by growth in emerging markets. The first quarter update suggests it’s on track but risks remain.” Nestle shares rose 0.7 percent after it maintained a modest 2-4 percent growth target for underlying sales, slightly less than Unilever’s. Shares in Spanish infrastructure company Abertis rose 3.3 percent, among top European gainers, as the market weighed Italian peer Atlantia’s plan to take over the company. Deutsche Bank downgraded both stocks from buy to hold. “We believe the market could apply a risk discount to Atlantia on the possibility of a take-over bid premium,” said analysts at the bank. Atlantia shares were down 1 percent. Energy sector stocks were in the red, reeling from a sharp slide in oil prices overnight. Lundin Petroleum and Tullow Oil were among the top fallers in the sector . In another sign of a better backdrop for the asset management industry, British hedge fund Man Group shares rose 2.9 percent after it reported net inflows over the first quarter. “This is a very strong start to the year that is likely to lead to consensus upgrades,” said Liberum analysts. Earlier this week peer fund manager Ashmore posted net inflows for the first time in nearly three years, and on Wednesday Henderson posted first quarter results, showing assets were cushioned by market gains in the period. Pandora was up 5.6 percent, regaining ground after a broker downgrade hit it earlier in the week. The company updated its financial reporting structure, confirming its 2017 outlook. Swedish packaging firm Billerudkorsnas gained 4.3 percent after it posted first-quarter profits in line with forecasts, saying it expected strong demand in the current quarter. Construction equipment rental company Ashtead fell 3.7 percent after its U.S. peer United Rentals’ results disappointed. France’s CAC 40 outperformed peers, rising 0.6 percent with banks BNP Paribas and Societe Generale among top gainers, up 2.9 and 1.9 percent respectively.

121,KHC,"Kraft Heinz's profit, sales miss on weak North America demand","(Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), North America’s No. 3 food and beverage company, reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit and sales, due to weak demand for its Velveeta cheese, Planters nuts and Oscar Mayer meats brands in the United States and Canada. Shares of the company, which is backed by Warren Buffett and private equity firm 3G, were down 1.2 percent at $88.05 in after-hours trading on Wednesday. U.S. sales, which account for more than two-thirds of Kraft’s total revenue, dipped 3.5 percent in the first quarter ended April 1. Canada sales fell 12.2 percent in the quarter due to delayed contract agreements with key retailers, the company said. Kraft said despite raising prices by nearly 1 percent, organic sales dropped 3.5 percent, as consumption fell across its brands in the United States, its biggest market. A muted spending environment in North America coupled with changing consumer tastes toward fresh, organic food over processed food has forced the packaged food maker to launch new products and revamp its ready-to-eat meals to remove synthetic colors and preservatives. Kraft, in January, had partnered with Oprah Winfrey to create a new healthy line of packaged food called Mealtime Stories. The company’s net sales fell 3.1 percent to $6.36 billion, missing analysts’ average estimate of $6.45 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Kraft, which aims to reduce $1.7 billion in costs by the end of 2017, said it continues to generate savings from zero based budgeting and supply chain initiatives in all areas apart from North America. The company made a $143 billion bid for Unilever (ULVR.L), (UNc.AS) as part of its strategy to become a leading consumer goods giant by buying competitors, and cutting costs and jobs to drive profits.

122,KHC,"UPDATE 2-Kraft Heinz's profit, sales miss on weak North America demand","(Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), North America’s No. 3 food and beverage company, reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit and sales, due to weak demand for its Velveeta cheese, Planters nuts and Oscar Mayer meats brands in the United States and Canada. Shares of the company, which is backed by Warren Buffett and private equity firm 3G, were down 1.2 percent at $88.05 in after-hours trading on Wednesday. U.S. sales, which account for more than two-thirds of Kraft’s total revenue, dipped 3.5 percent in the first quarter ended April 1. Canada sales fell 12.2 percent in the quarter due to delayed contract agreements with key retailers, the company said. Kraft said despite raising prices by nearly 1 percent, organic sales dropped 3.5 percent, as consumption fell across its brands in the United States, its biggest market. A muted spending environment in North America coupled with changing consumer tastes toward fresh, organic food over processed food has forced the packaged food maker to launch new products and revamp its ready-to-eat meals to remove synthetic colors and preservatives. Kraft, in January, had partnered with Oprah Winfrey to create a new healthy line of packaged food called Mealtime Stories. The company’s net sales fell 3.1 percent to $6.36 billion, missing analysts’ average estimate of $6.45 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Kraft, which aims to reduce $1.7 billion in costs by the end of 2017, said it continues to generate savings from zero based budgeting and supply chain initiatives in all areas apart from North America. The company made a $143 billion bid for Unilever (ULVR.L), (UNc.AS) as part of its strategy to become a leading consumer goods giant by buying competitors, and cutting costs and jobs to drive profits. However, the U.S. company walked away from a tussle with Unilever in February, after the Anglo-Dutch company rejected the offer. Net income attributable to shareholders was $893 million, or 73 cents per share, in the first quarter, compared with $896 million, or 73 cents per share, in the year-earlier period.

126,KHC,RPT-Buffett to face big crowd as Berkshire grows bigger,"(Repeats to widen distribution) By Jonathan Stempel May 3 (Reuters) - As the United States adapts to the presidency of Donald Trump and faces rising tensions abroad, Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders will descend on Omaha, Nebraska this weekend seeking reassurance, from Warren Buffett. The weekend known as “Woodstock for Capitalists” is unique in corporate America, a celebration of the billionaire’s image and success at a conglomerate whose businesses range from Geico insurance to the BNSF railroad to See’s candies to Ginsu knives. Buffett, 86, and vice chairman Charlie Munger, 93, will answer five hours of questions at Saturday’s annual meeting. Many say it reinforces their views about investing and Berkshire, even if it remains unclear how much new they learn. “Watching someone like (Buffett) with strong command on details of the economy and Berkshire’s operations is very impressive,” said Meyer Shields, a Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst who rates Berkshire “market perform.” “But you’re not going to learn a lot about Berkshire Hathaway the company.” Last year’s attendance fell to about 37,000 from more than 40,000 a year earlier. But there were also 1.1 million real-time sign-ons to Yahoo Finance, which webcast the meeting for the first time. It will do so again, in English and Mandarin. Much of Berkshire’s relative outperformance came decades ago when it was much smaller, and even Buffett has called the company’s huge size an “anchor on investment performance.” Buffett has said Berkshire owns 10 businesses big enough to make the Fortune 500 list of large U.S. companies on their own. But details can be thin. For example, aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts, acquired last year for $32.1 billion, merited about a page in Berkshire’s annual report. Precision’s final annual report, in 2015, ran 87 pages. “It’s a large, large organization,” said Jeffrey Stacey, founder of Stacey Muirhead Capital Management in Waterloo, Ontario, who is attending his 26th straight meeting. “I am willing to give it the benefit of the doubt because the track record has been so good for so long.” Buffett said in February that boosting disclosure could put many Berkshire businesses at a disadvantage, and that “it’s the growth of the Berkshire forest that counts.” He also knows the perils of conglomerates, saying in 2015 that dubious accounting, self-promotion and mediocre businesses make them “richly deserve” their “terrible” reputation. Buffett says Berkshire is different, in part because he took Munger’s advice to buy wonderful businesses at fair prices. Shareholders enjoy that focus less than they once did. Berkshire’s share price has slightly lagged the Standard & Poor’s 500 including dividends during the eight-year bull market, but has outperformed since the global financial crisis mushroomed in September 2008. Shields, who is not attending Saturday’s meeting, wants Buffett to reveal more, even if shareholders can “safely assume” his eventual successor as chief executive is top-flight. While Buffett and Munger do not know in advance the questions they will get from shareholders, journalists and analysts at Saturday’s meeting, they can anticipate many. Buffett may need to review Berkshire’s support of Wells Fargo & Co, in which it holds a roughly 10 percent stake, despite a sales scandal over bogus customer accounts. He may also get questions about his support for 3G Capital, a Brazilian firm known for ruthless cost-cutting. Berkshire controls Kraft Heinz Co with 3G, and recently tried to help 3G buy Unilever NV  for $143 billion. Trump is sure to come up. Buffett did not support his election but Berkshire’s book value could swell by $36 billion with his proposed corporate tax cuts, Barclays Capital said. Buffett may also get questions about his surprise bets on Apple Inc and the four biggest U.S. airlines. Having gone over a year since a big acquisition, Buffett may be asked how he can better deploy the $86.4 billion of cash, equivalents and Treasury bills that Berkshire recently held. Succession may also come up. Indeed, Buffett has already delegated work to lieutenants like Ajit Jain, Gregory Abel, Tracy Britt Cool and Todd Combs that he once would do himself.

129,KHC,LPC-Banks line up €4bn debt for Unilever spreads sale,"LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - Banks are putting together around €4bn-equivalent of debt financing to back a potential sale of Anglo-Dutch consumer group Unilever’s margarine and spreads business, banking source said. Unilever hired Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley on the sale, which could fetch as much as £6bn. It follows a far-reaching review of Unilever’s business prompted by February’s unsolicited US$143bn takeover offer from Kraft Heinz. The sale is expected to attract attention from a number of private equity firms and banks are lining up debt financings to back any of the potential bids. “This is a classic transaction where a sponsor can add value as the spreads business is coming out of a huge corporate and a private equity firm can turn it around,” a senior banker said. Some US$4bn of debt financing equates to around 6 times the unit’s approximate €650m Ebitda. With adjustments, one banker placed Ebitda as high as €800m. The size of the financing is likely to vary until it is clear what the exact perimeters of the deal are and what is included in the sale. Unilever’s spreads business includes brands like Blue Band, Flora and Stork butter. Both leveraged loans and high-yield bonds will be considered, denominated in sterling, euros and dollars. “From a financing perspective you can do anything, loans and bonds in sterling, euros and dollars. It is a big business with a lot of liquidity and a global footprint,” the banker said.

132,KHC,"UPDATE 1-Buffett assails Wells Fargo, defends 3G at wide-ranging meeting","(Adds graphic link) By Jonathan Stempel OMAHA, Neb., May 6 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, on Saturday faulted Wells Fargo & Co for failing to stop employees from signing up customers for bogus accounts even after learning it was happening, causing a scandal. Wells Fargo, whose largest shareholder is Berkshire with a 10-percent stake worth roughly $27 billion, gave employees too much autonomy to engage in “cross-selling” multiple products to meet sales goals, Buffett said. This “incentivized the wrong type of behavior,” and former Chief Executive John Stumpf, who lost his job over the scandal, was too slow to fix the problem, Buffett said. Wells Fargo was among many topics discussed at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, where Buffett, 86, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 93, fielded dozens of questions from shareholders, journalists and analysts. “If there’s a major problem, the CEO will get wind of it. At that moment, that’s the key to everything. The CEO has to act,” Buffett said. “The main problem was they didn’t act when they learned about it.” Still, Buffett’s support of current management and board was key to ensuring the reelection of the entire board last month. Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk said “we agree” with Buffett’s comments, and have taken “decisive actions” to fix the problems and “make things right for customers.” Buffett likened the situation to Salomon Brothers Inc, where in 1991 he was installed as chairman to clean up a mess after the former chief executive failed to tell regulators a trader was submitting fake bids at Treasury auctions. Asked whether Berkshire’s decentralized structure could lead to a similar scandal, Buffett said “as we sit here, somebody is doing something wrong at Berkshire,” whose units employ 367,000 people. But he said Berkshire has an internal “hotline” to flag possible misbehavior, and which gets 4,000 calls a year. The meeting also included discussions about Berkshire’s succession plans, its controversial partnership with Brazilian firm 3G Capital, and whether it will start paying dividends or make a monster acquisition. Buffett has said Berkshire could have a new chief executive within 24 hours if he died or could not continue, and that nothing had changed just because he praised fewer managers than usual in his February shareholder letter. He said it may have been harder to single people out because “we have never had more good managers.” But he also said it would be a “terrible mistake” if capital allocation were not the “main talent” of his successor. Buffett did lavish much praise on top insurance executive Ajit Jain, who some investors believe could be that successor, saying “nobody could possibly replace Ajit. You can’t come close.” On 3G, with which Berkshire controls Kraft Heinz Co and tried to merge it with Unilever NV, Buffett acknowledged a dislike for the cost-cutting for which the Brazilian firm is known. But, he said, “it is absolutely essential to America that we become more productive, and 3G was “very good at making a business productive with fewer people.” Buffett also raised the possibility Berkshire could pay its first dividend since 1967, if “reasonably soon, even while I’m around,” the company had too much cash it could not reasonably deploy. “It could be repurchases, it could be dividends,” he said. Berkshire ended March with more than $96 billion of cash and cash-like instruments, and Munger said it could do a “$150 billion” acquisition now if it wanted. Buffett defended Berkshire’s foray into airlines, where it is a top investor in American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc. He had long disdained the industry, which had gone through many bankruptcies, but said he is confident it will not resort to “suicidally competitive” pricing strategies that could spell doom. Munger added: “You’ve got to remember railroads were a terrible business for decades and decades and decades, and then they got good.” Berkshire bought the BNSF railroad in 2010. Buffett also admitted he was wrong to think International Business Machines Corp “would do better” when he started amassing 81 million shares six years ago. Berkshire recently sold about one-third of those shares even as it built a huge stake in Apple Inc, which Buffett said is more as a “consumer” company that a technology company. He also addressed criticism that Berkshire discloses too little about businesses such as aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, which it bought last year for $32.1 billion. “We want you to understand what you own,” he said, and “there are just a million things that are of minor importance” at Berkshire, whose market value is about $411 billion. Buffett also noted that Berkshire reported far fewer investment gains in the first quarter, which dragged on results, but said the company now has a slight preference for taking tax losses, which could lose value if Washington lawmakers reduce the 35 percent corporate tax rate. The annual meeting, expected to draw more than last year’s estimated 37,000 shareholders, is the main event of a weekend of events that Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists.” Buffett and Munger took questions after the traditional shareholder movie, and after Buffett had roamed a nearby exhibit hall featuring products from Berkshire companies. He was joined at the traditional newspaper tossing contest by friends including Microsoft Corp co-founder and Berkshire director Bill Gates, and Miami Dolphins defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh. Hundreds of shareholders lined up early outside downtown Omaha’s CenturyLink Center for the meeting. Several said they got there nearly five hours before doors opened around 6:45 a.m. “Every year it seems I have to come earlier,” said Chris Tesari, a retired businessman from Pacific Palisades, California who said he arrived at 3:20 a.m. for his 21st meeting. “It’s a pilgrimage.” ",5062017,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-buffett/update-1-buffett-assails-wells-fargo-defends-3g-at-wide-ranging-meeting-idUSL1N1I80KQ

134,KHC,Buffett's praise of Jack Bogle sounds self-serving,"DALLAS (Reuters Breakingviews) - Warren Buffett respects his elders. During Berkshire Hathaway’s  annual shareholder bash in Omaha on Saturday, the 86-year-old Oracle sang the praises of – and delivered early 88th birthday wishes to – Jack Bogle, the Vanguard founder who pioneered low-fee index mutual funds. While the sentiment is undoubtedly genuine, it is also starting to sound a bit self-serving. Buffett told the 40,000-strong live audience that Bogle had done “more for the American investor than any man in the country” by saving them tens of billions of dollars in unnecessary charges from portfolio managers. For a long while, though, Buffett offered an even better and equally cheap alternative to simply tracking the biggest stocks. Back in 1990, for example, the annual total return on Berkshire Hathaway common shares for the previous decade was 32 percent, or an astounding 18 percentage points higher than the S&P; 500 Index. By 2016, the annual gap had shrunk to just 1.3 percentage points, according to a recent Breakingviews analysis. In the latest quarter Berkshire, the company Buffett has run for some half a century, lost money in part because of the cornerstone business of insurance underwriting. At the same time, some of its biggest holdings are in companies that have longer-term question marks that could make it harder for the $400 billion conglomerate to outperform the broader index consistently. Wells Fargo, for one, is still working through its disastrous fake-accounts scandal. Investors just lodged a large protest vote against the board and Buffett on Saturday criticized the bank for how the affair was handled. He also revealed right before his gathering that he had dumped a third of his stake in IBM, whose value has fallen by about a fifth since Buffett first invested in 2011. Kraft Heinz, the U.S. food juggernaut in which Berkshire is a big owner, said last week that sales declined amid changing consumer habits. And even as Buffett swigged Coca-Cola on stage, the company’s sales have been falling with concerns growing about sugary drinks. Meanwhile, Buffett concedes that he “blew it” by not investing in Google and was “too dumb” to realize what Jeff Bezos was building at Amazon. Sitting out the new breed of American icons has been costly. As his returns converge with the S&P; 500 Index, Berkshire begins to look like another low-cost steady choice compared to otherwise woeful actively managed funds.

But the billionaire said on CNBC television that the incident did not undermine his investment strategy, in which his Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) became the largest investor in the airline’s parent, United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N). The April 9 episode caught on video showed David Dao, a doctor, being pulled from a United seat to make way for a crew member, resulting in a broken nose and concussion.  It brought wide criticism to United and Chief Executive Oscar Munoz, who initially defended the carrier’s employees and was later called to testify in Congress. “Obviously it was a terrible mistake,” Buffett said. Munoz has since “apologized many times, but your first reaction is going to get a lot of attention.” Berkshire is also a major investor in United rivals American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) and Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N). Buffett said the industry has become more efficient, even if fuller planes and tighter seats cause a “fair amount of discomfort” that makes passengers grumble. He said the Dao incident wouldn’t change that. “They may become like cattle cars,” he said, “but a significant percentage (of passengers) would rather be treated that way and fly for X than have far more leg room (and other benefits) and fly for X plus 25 percent.” “It’s a job I don’t want, running an airline,” he added. Buffett also discussed U.S. President Donald Trump, who was rarely mentioned at Berkshire’s annual meeting on Saturday, where Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger answered five hours of shareholder and analyst questions. Buffett said he did not believe Trump has had “that much of an effect” on the U.S. economy. He said the current 35 percent corporate tax rate was “not much” of a competitive disadvantage for U.S. companies, despite Trump’s push to slash it to 15 percent. “Whether it’s a better tax system or not depends on how it’s constructed,” he said. Referring to Congress, he said: “If they really try and make it revenue neutral, I guess it won’t pass.” Nonetheless, the “hatred” pervading American politics could impede any such agreement between Democrats and Republicans, Munger said on CNBC. “The parties hate each other so much, they both get quite irrational,” Munger said. Buffett also faulted the House Republican healthcare bill passed last week, which would repeal the Affordable Care Act and investment income taxes for wealthier people, as a means to “cut the hell out of income taxes” for the rich. Buffett said U.S. stocks looked “dirt cheap” for anyone who believed interest rates will stay low for a long time. “Bonds are a terrible choice against stocks,” he said. “It’s just dictated by mathematics.” Buffett defended 3G Capital, its partner on purchases including Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and an unsuccessful bid to merge it with Unilever NV (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS), and which is known for slashing thousands of jobs to make companies more efficient. “They have followed the standard capitalist formula ... of trying to do the same business with fewer people,” Buffett said. “People live better when there is more output per capita.” He said he had grown more fond of Apple Inc (AAPL.O), in which Berkshire has disclosed a roughly $20 billion stake, because he could “very easily determine” the iPhone maker’s competitive position “and who is trying to chase them.” Asked if he had stopped buying, Buffett said: “Maybe, maybe not.” ",5082017,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-buffett/update-2-buffett-united-made-terrible-mistake-with-dragged-passenger-cnbc-idUSL1N1IA0CZ
136,KHC,Buffett says deal partner 3G follows 'standard capitalist formula'-CNBC,"May 8 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett said on Monday 3G Capital, its controversial partner on multiple transactions, follows a “standard capitalist formula” when it sweeps away thousands of jobs and imposes deep expense cuts to make the companies it buys more efficient. Speaking on CNBC television, Buffett said, “It’s a defect of mine” that he doesn’t focus as closely on the efficiency of business units at Berkshire Hathaway Inc, the conglomerate he has run since 1965. Berkshire and 3G control Kraft Heinz Co and recently tried to merge it with Unilever NV UNc.AS> for $143 billion, but was rebuffed. The Brazilian firm is known for “zero-based budgeting,” where it requires managers to periodically defend all of their expenses, and cuts waste where possible. “They have followed the standard capitalist formula ... of trying to do the same business with fewer people,” Buffett said. “People live better when there is more output per capita.” Nonetheless, he acknowledged that cutting jobs can be a “painful process.” Separately, Buffett expressed regret over his failure to invest early in Internet search company Google, now part of Alphabet Inc, saying “I should have some insight into” what became an “extraordinary business” with attributes of a monopoly. He said he was more comfortable buying shares of Apple Inc , in which Berkshire has disclosed a 133 million share stake, worth close to $20 billion on Friday. Buffett noted that many iPhone purchasers are repeat customers who know a new phone will be introduced regularly, or buy them for such occasions as graduations. “I can very easily determine the competitive position of Apple now and who is trying to chase them,” he said. He said “the shares, when we bought them, were much more reasonable” in price. Asked if he had stopped buying Apple, Buffett said: “Maybe, may not.” Buffett said he was not bothered by initial U.S. data showing the economy grew at just 0.7 percent in the first quarter, saying it was “more or less” growing at 2 percent a year. He said some of Berkshire’s industrial units saw upticks in business this year, as have credit card companies such as Visa Inc and American Express Co, a longtime Berkshire investment. “Credit cards will tell you a lot about the consumer, what their attitude is,” he said.

138,KHC,Nestle may sell U.S. confectionery business,"LONDON (Reuters) - Nestle (NESN.S) may sell its roughly $900 million-a-year U.S. confectionery business, which includes Butterfinger and BabyRuth, in the Swiss food group’s latest effort to improve the health profile of its sprawling portfolio. The world’s largest packaged foods maker said on Thursday it would “explore strategic options”, including a possible sale, for the business that also includes 100Grand, SkinnyCow and Raisinets. Analysts have been speculating that Nestle could exit the U.S. confectionary business which is not in line with its stated strategy of becoming more health and nutrition-focused. That strategy, underlined by last year’s naming of a healthcare veteran as CEO, comes as the whole packaged food sector battles a slowdown from a new generation of savvy consumers that are eating fresher and healthier foods. The review is limited to the United States, where Nestle does not control its key KitKat brand, and is No. 4 behind Mars, Hershey (HSY.N) and Mondelez International (MDLZ.O). With annual sales of 900 million Swiss francs ($923 million), the U.S. confectionery business accounts for only 1 percent of company sales. Nestle’s other products range from instant coffee to mineral water and baby food. “This might seem small stuff, but in our view it could be a significant step by new-ish CEO Mark Schneider ... toward a more deliberate and efficient capital allocation strategy,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst James Edwardes Jones in a note. Nestle said it remained “fully committed” to growing its international confectionery business, particularly KitKat, which is made in the United States by Hershey. It said it would also keep the Nestle Toll House baking products. Globally, Nestle’s confectionery business generated sales of 8.8 billion Swiss francs ($9.02 billion) last year. TO-DO LIST The global packaged food industry has seen a wave of deals as companies seek to boost profits in a weak market. Unilever (ULVR.L) is trying to sell its shrinking margarines business after rebuffing a takeover bid by Kraft Heinz (KHC.O), and Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB.L) is selling its French’s mustard business to pay down debt from its purchase of Mead Johnson MJN.N, which closed on Thursday.  Nestle had organic sales growth of 3.2 percent last year, which Bernstein analysts said was the lowest of this century and the fifth straight year of slowing growth.   With that backdrop, Nestle has pushed aggressively into areas of health and nutritional science, buying and investing in a range of biotech and medical device firms, as it presses the boundaries between food and medicine. At the same time it has divested underperforming businesses including the Nutrament drink, Jenny Craig diet business and PowerBar snacks. Last year, it formed an ice cream joint venture with Britain’s R&R.; Last year, RBC’s Jones said a strategic review of the confectionery business should be near the top of the new CEO’s to-do list. “It’s incompatible with Nestle’s strategy, margins are falling and its competitive position is anemic,” he said.

140,KHC,Danone looks to ride healthy food revolution wave,"PARIS (Reuters) - Emmanuel Faber, CEO of Danone, wants the world’s biggest yogurt maker to play a central role in the revolution sweeping the global food industry as it tries to respond to a consumer shift towards healthy eating. As more consumers, notably the “Millennial” generation, opt for healthier diets and a more socially responsible way of life, Danone, along with rivals such as Nestle, have been seeking to adapt. Faber unveiled a new company “signature” dubbed “One Planet. One Health” for Danone on Thursday in Berlin at the annual meeting of the Consumer Goods Forum, a gathering of the world’s biggest retailers and packaged food companies.  “A revolution is cooking, what are we going to do about it?” Faber told the meeting, warning that consumers will turn their backs on big food companies if they do not do more to address issues like obesity, inequality and climate change. “We are losing them. They are getting out of our shops, out of our brands. They are going for food without the food industry. Not only without us, but maybe against us,” he said. Danone has bought U.S. organic food producer WhiteWave in a $12.5 billion deal, bringing the company more into line with healthier eating trends. The deal also aims to boost growth at Danone, whose shares trade at a discount to rivals. The company’s depressed valuation was highlighted this week as a reason for it being touted as a potential bid target. Faber told Reuters that Danone, which has no large controlling shareholder, was “no more and no less than usual” vulnerable to a possible takeover bid. Danone is seeking to build on the WhiteWave deal with a campaign to promote itself as a leader in terms of healthy eating habits.  “The global industrial food system is reaching its limits,” Faber told Reuters in a phone interview before his speech in Berlin. He said evidence of this included obesity and malnutrition, wasting water and food, soil depletion, and climate change.  “Everywhere people want to regain control over their food,” said Faber, a rock climber and campaigner for corporate social responsibility. WhiteWave’s products have outsold mainstream packaged food businesses in recent years, highlighting the consumer shift toward natural foods and healthier eating. The deal should also help Danone to cope with tougher market conditions in dairy products in Europe, and babyfood in China. WhiteWave makes Danone the world’s biggest producer of organic food and gives it a stronger foothold in North America, which is becoming its biggest market, accounting for $6 billion, or around 25 percent of group sales against 13 percent previously.  Faber said he hoped the new Danone signature would help to address a general consumer mistrust of big, corporate brands. “Small brands communicate on their intentions, they are activists. It is key that big brands also state their intentions,” he said. Faber, the first Danone CEO from outside the founding Riboud family, is pushing on with a dual economic and social agenda, which - like that of many blue-chip companies - aims to not only boost shareholder value and profits but also meet other targets on the environment and social policies. “The big risk is to avoid transforming ourselves and end up only cutting costs to return cash to shareholders,” he said. A pledge at the annual shareholder meeting in April for Danone to be certified as a for-profit corporation that commits to positive social and environmental goals - was in line with that strategy, he said. Bid speculation around Danone pushed its shares sharply higher this week. Broker Exane said it could be an acquisition target for Kraft Heinz, also citing PepsiCo and Coca Cola as credible suitors. Analysts at Berenberg wrote in a research note that investors would need concrete evidence of Danone’s progress in its new areas. “We believe investors will need to see further evidence of organic growth and margin momentum to agree with the CEO that Danone is ‘uniquely placed to embrace the food revolution’ and for its valuation discount to the sector to close fully.” Faber is confident Danone will deliver. “I am absolutely convinced our strategy creates value for the long-term but also the short-term,” he said, adding he expected sales growth to improve in the third quarter.

141,KHC,UPDATE 3-Nestle plans $20.8 bln share buyback amid Third Point pressure,"* Nestle to repurchase up to $20.8 billion in shares by June 2020 * Food giant to boost debt ratio * Share buyback backloaded to allow for acquisitions (Adds analyst comment) By Martinne Geller and Silke Koltrowitz LONDON/ZURICH, June 27 (Reuters) - Nestle plans to buy back as much as 20 billion Swiss francs ($20.8 billion) worth of shares over three years, it said on Tuesday, days after U.S. activist shareholder Third Point LLC began a campaign to boost performance at the company. The New York-based hedge fund, controlled by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, disclosed a $3.5 billion stake in the company late on Sunday when it started pushing for Nestle to more aggressively boost performance and buy back shares. Nestle, maker of Gerber baby food and Perrier water, said its announcement was the result of a review of its priorities that had begun in early 2017. It did not mention Third Point in its statement, and Third Point declined to comment on the announcement. Such buyback plans take time to get approved, making it clear that Nestle had finalized the plan before Third Point made its position public. It could not be known, however, whether feedback that Loeb might have given Nestle in a meeting earlier this month was taken into consideration when crafting the final buyback plan, which will start on July 4. Still, the timing of the announcement suggests that pressure brought to bear by the activist investor, who has taken on giants including Yahoo and Sony Corp, may have played a role. “The timing of Nestle’s announcement gives the impression that management has been cowed or bullied by an activist investor owning 1.3 percent of the company,” said Bernstein analysts, in a reference to Loeb. Nestle said that share buybacks offer a “viable option to create shareholder value” in the context of low interest rates and strong cash flow generation. The volume of monthly share buybacks will depend on market conditions but will probably occur mostly in 2019 and 2020, so Nestle can consider acquisitions before then, it said. The company now expects to increase its level of debt to about 1.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by 2020. That would be up from about 0.8 times last year. Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy did not see the announcement as a direct result of Third Point. “We rather see today’s announcement as a thorough strategic review triggered by CEO Mark Schneider, approved by the board,” he said, noting that this was Nestle’s second-biggest buyback following 25 billion Swiss francs in 2007. The company has bought back 47 billion francs worth of shares since 2005. Nestle shares had jumped 4 percent on Monday, adding some $10 billion in market value before falling 1.6 percent on Tuesday, on hopes the push by Third Point would speed up changes under Schneider, who took over as CEO in January. On Tuesday, Nestle said it will focus any capital spending on high-growth food and beverage categories including coffee, pet care, infant nutrition and bottled water, as well as growth opportunities in consumer healthcare. The company has already made a series of investments in health-related businesses, and its appointment of Schneider, a healthcare industry veteran, suggests it will push further on the boundaries between nutrition and health. Nestle said this month’s announcement that it may sell its U.S. confectionery business was consistent with that approach. “The company will continue to adjust its portfolio in line with its strategy and growth objectives,” Nestle said. Billions of dollars worth of assets are up for grabs as the global packaged food industry adapts to slowing growth. For example, Unilever is selling its margarine and spreads business and Reckitt Benckiser is selling its mustard business. The pressure placed on the world’s largest food group, Europe’s most valuable company, shatters perceptions that the Swiss giant with over 2,000 brands is too big to shake up. CEO Schneider, who had met Loeb this month, seemed to hint at that last week when he told a conference in Berlin: “Size alone does not protect you from the winds of change.” Coupled with a shock $143 billion takeover bid from Kraft Heinz for Unilever in February, it shows the impatience of some investors about how multinationals are adapting. Loeb has argued that even though Nestle has exposure to promising categories such as coffee and pet food, its shares have underperformed rivals in recent years as it has “remained stuck in its old ways”. “It is rare to find a business of Nestle’s quality with so many avenues for improvement,” Loeb said in the letter to the fund’s investors. Nestle should set a target for margin growth to improve productivity, double its leverage to fund share buybacks, shed non-core assets and sell the 23 percent stake it owns in French cosmetics group L’Oreal, he said. Whereas Unilever and Danone have recently set margin targets for 2020, Nestle has not. It has announced a productivity programme to save 1.8 billion Swiss francs by 2020, but has not yet said how much of that would fall to the bottom line. Analysts have said that Schneider, who will lay out his strategy at an investor event in September, had already seemed more open to listening to the concerns of longtime shareholders, many of which were echoed by Third Point. Daniel Hauselmann, head of Swiss equities at GAM Investment Management, said much of what Third Point suggested was already being done. “Nestle is no sleeping giant that does not look after its shareholders,” he told Reuters. “I think Nestle should stick to its strategy.” ($1 = 0.9618 Swiss francs) (Additional reporting by John Miller and Angelika Gruber in Zurich and Michael Flaherty in New York; editing by Michael Shields, David Evans and Jonathan Oatis)",6272017,http://www.reuters.com/article/nestle-thirdpoint/update-3-nestle-plans-20-8-bln-share-buyback-amid-third-point-pressure-idUSL8N1JO4R1

143,KHC,Unilever is half way there on Kraft challenge,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Unilever is half way there on its Kraft Heinz challenge. The Anglo-Dutch owner of Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream cut costs faster than expected in the first half of the year by reducing ad spend and paying its suppliers less. Its 20 percent operating margin target looks reachable. Yet with U.S. rival Kraft Heinz free to go hostile next month, volume growth remains too low for comfort.  The unwelcome approach from Warren Buffett-backed Kraft Heinz in February has been positive in one respect. Unilever now looks considerably sharper on costs. In the first six months of 2017, it took 1 billion euros off its expenses. Half came from supply chain efficiencies, while around a third came from brand and marketing spending cuts – replacing ads less frequently sent agency fees down 17 percent. That still leaves a further 5 billion euros of planned cuts to be found. But with a first-half underlying operating margin of 17.8 percent, Unilever looks comfortably on track for a 2020 target of 20 percent. Its top line is shakier. Underlying sales growth of 3 percent came from price hikes, not selling more goods. Volume growth in Europe and the Americas was negative, markets which account for over half of group revenue. Stabilising currencies in emerging markets should drive consumer demand. And a sale or spinoff of Unilever’s troubled spreads unit – currently in the works – would eliminate one drag on group performance. For now, Chief Executive Paul Polman will still be looking over his shoulder. The six-month hiatus under British takeover rules that has kept Kraft Heinz at bay expires mid-August. Unilever’s increased bulk since February affords some protection. The U.S. group’s offer valued Unilever at $143 billion, whereas its current market capitalisation is $170 billion. Kraft’s own market capitalisation has fallen slightly to $104 billion. And a 20 percent premium would be needed to get shareholders’ mouths watering.  With profitability on the up, volume growth would bolster Unilever’s takeover defences. Half of the brand and marketing cost savings made so far this year will be ploughed back into souping up its products. That level of investment would be easier to defend if it looked like customers appreciated it.",7202017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-unilever-nv-results-breakingviews/unilever-is-half-way-there-on-kraft-challenge-idUSKBN1A519C
144,KHC,Kraft Heinz's quarterly profit beat powered by cost cuts,"(Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), the maker of Velveeta cheese, Heinz ketchup and Oscar Mayer meats, reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday as the company continued to cut costs amid weak demand in North America. Shares of North America’s third-largest food and beverages company were marginally up at $87.50 in after-market trading. Kraft, which is targeting to cut $1.7 billion in costs by the end of 2017, said on Thursday that its selling, general and administrative expenses fell about 15 percent to $760 million in the second quarter ended July 1. This is the fourth straight quarter of double-digit declines in selling, general and administrative expenses. However, the company, which is backed by billionaire-investor Warren Buffett and private equity firm 3G, said revenue fell 1.7 percent to $6.68 billion, the third straight quarter of drop. Analysts on average had expected $6.73 billion. U.S. sales dipped 1.2 percent in the quarter. The region accounts for more than two-thirds of the company’s total revenue.  But analysts did not read much into the decline. “The revenue line was not as bad as some observers may have feared, especially in light of recent U.S. food trends,” J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman wrote, adding that Kraft’s 0.9 percent drop in organic sales is better than numbers posted by peers. Mondelez (MDLZ.O) reported a 2.7 percent drop in organic sales for its latest quarter, while ConAgra (CAG.N) said in June total sales fell 9.3 percent in its fourth quarter.     Processed packaged food makers, including Kraft Heinz, are being pressured by increasing preference for healthier alternatives among U.S. consumers. Kraft Heinz has responded by launching products such as no salt-, no sugar-added Heinz Beanz and a new line of premium pasta sauces under the Classico Riserva brand with no artificial ingredients or added sugar.  The company has also relaunched Kool-Aid Jammers with fewer calories and no preservatives. Kraft’s net income surged 50.5 percent to $1.16 billion, or 94 cents per share, in the latest quarter. Excluding certain items, the company earned 98 cents per share, 3 cents ahead of analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

150,KHC,Fitch Rates The Kraft Heinz Company's $1.5B Sr Unsecured Notes 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 08 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned 'BBB-' ratings to The Kraft Heinz Company's (Kraft Heinz) $1.5 billion senior unsecured floating notes. Three tranches were issued: a $350 million 2-year floating rate note tranche maturing in August 2019, a $650 million 3.5-year floating rate note tranche maturing in February 2021, and a $500 million 5-year floating rate note tranche maturing in August 2022. Proceeds from the transaction will be used to repay all amounts outstanding under Kraft Heinz's $600 million term loan facility which matures in July 2022, and refinance a portion of its commercial paper (CP) outstanding. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Mature Markets Limit Organic Business Growth: Kraft Heinz generated $26 billion annual revenue in 2016. Its portfolio includes eight $1 billion-plus brands and many other large and well-known household brands. Kraft Heinz is heavily exposed to the mature, highly competitive North American market which makes up about 80% of sales and EBITDA. In addition, another 9% of its revenue comes from Europe, which is facing significant macro headwinds. Organic growth trends remain challenging for large packaged foods companies across most developed economies, due to brand maturity and changing consumer preferences. For the first half of 2017 (1H17), Kraft Heinz's organic sales were down by 1.8%, and Fitch expects that the full year top-line growth to be mildly negative. Beyond 2017, Fitch forecasts that the overall organic growth rate will be in the low single digits, assuming the North American and European businesses stabilize. Significant Margin Improvement Achieved: The ratings incorporate significant qualitative benefits from the company's 51% owners, 3G Capital (3G; 24.2% ownership) and Berkshire Hathaway (26.8%), and were previous owners of H.J. Heinz Company. 3G has substantially increased operating profitability and delevered acquired firms including H.J. Heinz Company (Heinz) and Restaurant Brands International, Inc. (formerly Burger King, which is now integrating the Canadian Tim Hortons chain purchased in December 2014). For example, 3G and Berkshire acquired Heinz in June 2013 and improved the company's leverage (total debt to EBITDA) to 6.2x in 2014 from 8.9x in 2013. The improvement was driven by a 35% EBITDA increase due to lower overhead and manufacturing costs and more than $1 billion in debt repayment. As of 2Q17, Kraft Heinz has achieved $1.45 billion in savings since the merger closed in July 2015, stronger than expected, and completed approximately 70% of footprint right-sizing. However, gross margin improvement in 2017 has been muted by increasing input prices. As a result, Fitch expects EBITDA to reach the low $8 billion range by 2018 versus prior expectations of around $9 billion. Progress Towards Deleveraging: The company has made strong progress to date and is on track to realize integration savings through fixed-cost and overhead reduction, rationalizing the manufacturing footprint, and realizing procurement savings from increased scale. Fitch estimates that leverage will trend towards the mid-3x range by 2019 from 5x in 2015 (on pro forma combined 2015 EBITDA of $6.7 billion), due to the combination of realizing a substantial portion of the targeted annual synergies and $2 billion of debt reduction (paydown of June 2017 maturities). Consolidating Retail Landscape: The price pressure on food companies from their distribution channels is reflective of the consolidation occurring within the retail world and the threat of the European hard-discount grocers expanding in and entering the U.S. market. KHC's retail customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors, are consolidating, resulting in fewer but larger customers with greater negotiating power who are demanding lower product pricing and/or more favorable terms. Wal-Mart, for example, KHC's largest customer, accounted for 22% and 20% of its net sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, Fitch expects Amazon's potential acquisition of Whole Foods, Inc. to result in even further downward pressure on food prices given Amazon's history of driving down prices in other industries. Fitch expects Kraft Heinz to respond to these challenges by stepping up marketing investments and increasing innovation. Elevated M&A; Event Risk: It has been two years since the Kraft / Heinz merger closed in July 2015. The combined company has been able to drive leverage down from a pro forma level of 5x in 2015 to 4.3x in 2016. In February 2017, Kraft Heinz approached Unilever with an acquisition proposal for a purchase price of $143 billion. The acquisition would have increased leverage. Unilever declined the proposal. This Unilever overture affirmed Kraft Heinz's interest in seeking greater scale, geographic expansion and cost-cutting opportunities that could offset the challenging organic top-line growth environment, but would have delayed Kraft Heinz's deleveraging timeframe. DERIVATION SUMMARY The packaged food industry is highly competitive. Kraft Heinz competes with both large national and international food and beverage companies and numerous local and regional companies. It competes with both branded products and private brands on the basis of product quality, innovation, consumer preference relevancy, brand recognition and the effectiveness of its marketing programs, distribution, shelf space, merchandising support, and price. Kraft Heinz' Rating of 'BBB-' reflects the company's large scale with $26 billion annual sales, industry-leading EBITDA margin at approximately 29%, and elevated leverage after the Kraft/Heinz merger. Comparing to other packaged foods companies that are in Fitch's public rating coverage universe, Kraft Heinz has the largest scale, highest EBITDA margin, and a total Debt/EBITDA leverage ratio of 4.3x as of December 2016, reflecting merger related debt. General Mills ('BBB+'/ Negative Outlook) had annual revenue of $15.6 billion and was levered at 3.3x total Debt/EBITDA as of December 2016. Mondelez ('BBB'/Stable Outlook) had annual revenue of $25.9 billion and was levered at 3.5x total Debt/EBITDA as of December 2016. Conagra ('BBB-'/Positive Outlook) had annual revenue of $7.8 billion and was levered at 1.9x total Debt/EBITDA as of May 2017. Fitch expects Kraft Heinz to benefit from its scale, continue to generate strong cash flow, and steadily pay down debt associated with the merger. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: -- 2017 revenue of approximately $26 billion, reflecting flat organic top line growth and minor FX headwinds. Revenue is expected to grow at a low-single-digit organic growth rate thereafter, assuming neutral currency. -- Fitch expects EBITDA margin to exceed 30% and reach $8 billion by 2018 as the company realizes full run-rate of $1.7 billion in targeted cost synergies. -- FCF (after dividends) is expected to be modestly negative in 2017 primarily due to significant integration cash charges and capex. Fitch expects FCF to turn positive and could increase significantly from 2018 onwards as cash charges decline. -- No share repurchases assumed in the forecast period. -- Fitch estimates that leverage will trend towards a mid-3x range by 2019 due to a combination of moderate EBITDA growth and $2 billion of debt reduction (repayment of 2017 maturities). Fitch assumed the latest refinancing of term loan and CP to be leverage-neutral. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action -- Over the long term, a positive rating action could be supported by consistent positive organic volume growth, substantial and growing EBITDA and FCF generation, along with meaningful debt reduction that takes leverage towards the 3x range. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action -- Sustained top-line weakness and potential market share loss in major categories; -- Inability to achieve targeted cost synergies, leading to insufficient FCF or cash on hand to pay down debt, which results in total debt/EBITDA sustaining above mid-3x over the medium term; -- A sizeable debt-financed acquisition that limits the company's ability to return leverage to the mid-3x range 24-36 months post transaction. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: Kraft Heinz's key sources of liquidity are its $4 billion revolving credit facility maturing in 2021, and cash on hand. As of July 1, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 billion ($0.9 billion based outside of the U.S.) in addition to its $4 billion undrawn senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Capital Structure: As of July 1, 2017, Kraft Heinz had total debt outstanding of $30.8 billion, including $1.1 billion CP outstanding, $1.4 billion senior secured debt, and $28.3 billion senior unsecured debt. During 2Q17, the company paid down $2 billion of senior unsecured bonds that matured in June 2017. On Aug. 7, 2017, Kraft Heinz issued $1.5 billion of senior unsecured floating notes, and used the proceeds to repay all amounts outstanding under the $600 million term loan facility which matures in July 2022, refinance a portion of the CP outstanding, and for other general corporate purposes. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Kraft Heinz as follows: The Kraft Heinz Company (Parent) --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB-'. Kraft Heinz Foods Company --Long-term IDR at 'BBB-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F3'; --Commercial Paper at 'F3' --$4 billion unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB-' --$1.2 billion second-lien secured notes due February 2025 at 'BBB' (legacy Heinz). Kraft Canada (operating subsidiary) --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB-'; --CAD Senior Unsecured notes at 'BBB-'. H.J. Heinz Finance UK Plc. --$125 million GBP 6.25% second-lien secured notes due February 2030 at 'BBB' (legacy Heinz). With the new senior unsecured notes issuance, Fitch assigned the following ratings: Kraft Heinz Foods Company --Assigned a 'BBB-' rating to the $350 million 2-year floating notes maturing in August 2019; --Assigned a 'BBB-' rating to the $650 million 3.5-year floating notes maturing in February 2021 --Assigned a 'BBB-' rating to the $500 million 5-year floating notes maturing in August 2022.

154,KHC,UPDATE 1-Activist fund Corvex has $400 mln stake in Danone -Bloomberg,"(Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Corvex Management owns shares in French food group Danone SA (DANO.PA) worth about $400 million, viewing the world’s largest yogurt maker as significantly undervalued, Bloomberg reported late on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. The New York-based hedge fund, run by Keith Meister, does not currently plan to publicly push for management changes or launch a proxy fight against the yogurt maker, though the stance could change, according to the report. (bloom.bg/2vVwxiE) On Monday, Corvex warned of a proxy battle at another company, Energen Corp (EGN.N). The maker of Activia yogurt and Evian water has recently been touted as a potential target by suitors or activist shareholders, given that the company’s profits are below many of its peers and its sales have disappointed. Such a move at Danone would closely follow recent engagement by other activist shareholders at larger rivals Nestle SA (NESN.S) and Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N). Officials for Corvex and Danone declined to comment. Danone has not hired advisers to deal with Corvex as it believes the stake is too small to warrant a defense strategy, Financial Times reported, citing people close to the company. (on.ft.com/2vCE1o5) Danone’s listed American Depositary Receipts were up nearly 7 percent on Monday. Its Paris-listed shares had earlier closed up more than 2 percent, following a Sunday report from the New York Post citing someone saying Danone could be a takeover target, for the likes of Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) or Coca-Cola Co (KO.N). That echoed similar assertions made recently by analysts such as those at Exane, who said in a June research note that the election of centrist President Emmanuel Macron could make a takeover more likely in a country that had traditionally resisted foreign takeovers of its companies. In 2005 France dashed to the support of Danone in the face of a rumored bid from PepsiCo Inc PEP.N, which never actually materialized. (reut.rs/2wHZQTw) Danone Chief Executive Officer Emmanuel Faber has played down the takeover speculation, telling Reuters in June that the company, which has no large controlling shareholder, was “no more and no less than usual” vulnerable to a possible takeover bid. Analysts have been speculating about activists’ next target, following the June revelation that Dan Loeb’s Third Point hedge fund had taken a $3.5 billion stake in Nestle, urging it to more aggressively improve returns, and the campaign by Nelson Peltz at Procter & Gamble, where he is pushing for a board seat.

155,KHC,Bankruptcy fight over Oncor to test Warren Buffett's discipline,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett takes pride in naming his price to buy a company, and not paying a nickel more. But the largest U.S. natural gas distribution utility, an unyielding hedge fund, and a Delaware bankruptcy judge now present one of the biggest challenges to the billionaire’s legendary discipline. The board of bankrupt Texas utility Energy Future Holdings will meet later on Sunday to decide whether to sell its crown jewel, power transmission company Oncor, to Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc or accept an opposing bid from Sempra Energy, a person familiar with the confidential deliberations said on condition of anonymity.  The rival bid for Oncor was disclosed on Friday by Energy Future’s biggest creditor, billionaire Paul Singer’s hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. The identity of the bidder was not publicly announced, but Bloomberg News first reported on Saturday that Sempra was the mystery bidder, citing anonymous sources. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Buffett’s energy unit, has offered $9 billion in cash for Oncor, while the rival bid is for $9.3 billion, a lawyer for Elliott said on Friday.  The gap is pocket change for Berkshire, but Buffett pledged last Wednesday not to raise his offer. “Paying extra is not the way he does business,” said Jim Shanahan, a senior analyst at Edward Jones & Co with a “buy” rating on Berkshire. “He is willing to be patient and wait for opportunities. That’s what analysts expect, and that’s what investors expect.” Berkshire did not respond to requests for comment, while Sempra and Elliott declined to comment. Berkshire said on Friday that its bid had won support from key stakeholders, including the staff of the Public Utility Commission of Texas, the regulator that has to approve the sale of Oncor. The commission’s executive director, Brian Lloyd, has also praised Berkshire’s bid. Berkshire has told the regulator it will accept “ringfencing” on its acquisition of Oncor, restricting its ability to extract cash from the company or add more debt to it. It is unclear whether Sempra could offer the same assurances.  “Berkshire Hathaway Energy has offered a positive, simple, straightforward deal that benefits Oncor and its customers,” Oncor CEO Bob Shapard said in a statement on Saturday. Even if regulatory concerns trump price considerations, and Berkshire’s bid for Oncor prevails on Sunday over that of Sempra, a San Diego-based utility, the sale has to be approved on Monday by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Sontchi in Wilmington, Delaware.  Elliott has said it opposes the sale to Berkshire because it believes it undervalues Oncor, and has argued it owns enough of Energy Future’s debt to veto the deal. Elliott has also been trying to put together its own bid for $9.3 billion to buy Oncor.    Buffett, 86, is trying to end the two-year lull since announcing his last major acquisition, a $32.1 billion takeover of aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp. Many analysts at the time said that price looked relatively costly by Berkshire’s standards. Complicating Buffett’s hunt for bargains are soaring stock market valuations and competition from private equity firms with a lot of funds to spend, as well as from companies with anemic earnings growth that are turning to acquisitions for a recovery in their fortunes. Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate, whose more than 90 businesses include auto insurer Geico and railroad BNSF, ended June with close to $100 billion of cash and equivalents. That is up $27 billion in the last year, and five times Buffett's $20 billion stated target. (tmsnrt.rs/2fTsMnt) Some analysts say idle cash is also weighing on Berkshire’s operating profit, which has dropped for three straight quarters. “Buffett likes to achieve 11 percent returns,” and low-yielding cash may deprive Berkshire of billions of dollars annually, said Robert Miles, an author of books about Buffett. But George Morgan, a finance professor at the University of Nebraska Omaha, said that “as far as cash being a drag on performance, Warren would say no. Just because you’re in a store doesn’t mean you need to buy something.” Buffett has in 2017 used some Berkshire cash to become one of Apple Inc’s largest shareholders, and shore up Canadian lender Home Capital Group Inc’s finances.

156,KHC,Bankruptcy fight over Oncor to test Warren Buffett's discipline,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett takes pride in naming his price to buy a company, and not paying a nickel more. But the largest U.S. natural gas distribution utility, an unyielding hedge fund, and a Delaware bankruptcy judge now present one of the biggest challenges to the billionaire’s legendary discipline. The board of bankrupt Texas utility Energy Future Holdings will meet later on Sunday to decide whether to sell its crown jewel, power transmission company Oncor, to Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc or accept an opposing bid from Sempra Energy, a person familiar with the confidential deliberations said on condition of anonymity.  The rival bid for Oncor was disclosed on Friday by Energy Future’s biggest creditor, billionaire Paul Singer’s hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. The identity of the bidder was not publicly announced, but Bloomberg News first reported on Saturday that Sempra was the mystery bidder, citing anonymous sources. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Buffett’s energy unit, has offered $9 billion in cash for Oncor, while the rival bid is for $9.3 billion, a lawyer for Elliott said on Friday.  The gap is pocket change for Berkshire, but Buffett pledged last Wednesday not to raise his offer. “Paying extra is not the way he does business,” said Jim Shanahan, a senior analyst at Edward Jones & Co with a “buy” rating on Berkshire. “He is willing to be patient and wait for opportunities. That’s what analysts expect, and that’s what investors expect.” Berkshire did not respond to requests for comment, while Sempra and Elliott declined to comment. Berkshire said on Friday that its bid had won support from key stakeholders, including the staff of the Public Utility Commission of Texas, the regulator that has to approve the sale of Oncor. The commission’s executive director, Brian Lloyd, has also praised Berkshire’s bid. Berkshire has told the regulator it will accept “ringfencing” on its acquisition of Oncor, restricting its ability to extract cash from the company or add more debt to it. It is unclear whether Sempra could offer the same assurances.  “Berkshire Hathaway Energy has offered a positive, simple, straightforward deal that benefits Oncor and its customers,” Oncor CEO Bob Shapard said in a statement on Saturday. Even if regulatory concerns trump price considerations, and Berkshire’s bid for Oncor prevails on Sunday over that of Sempra, a San Diego-based utility, the sale has to be approved on Monday by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Sontchi in Wilmington, Delaware.  Elliott has said it opposes the sale to Berkshire because it believes it undervalues Oncor, and has argued it owns enough of Energy Future’s debt to veto the deal. Elliott has also been trying to put together its own bid for $9.3 billion to buy Oncor.    Buffett, 86, is trying to end the two-year lull since announcing his last major acquisition, a $32.1 billion takeover of aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp. Many analysts at the time said that price looked relatively costly by Berkshire’s standards. Complicating Buffett’s hunt for bargains are soaring stock market valuations and competition from private equity firms with a lot of funds to spend, as well as from companies with anemic earnings growth that are turning to acquisitions for a recovery in their fortunes. Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate, whose more than 90 businesses include auto insurer Geico and railroad BNSF, ended June with close to $100 billion of cash and equivalents. That is up $27 billion in the last year, and five times Buffett's $20 billion stated target. (tmsnrt.rs/2fTsMnt) Some analysts say idle cash is also weighing on Berkshire’s operating profit, which has dropped for three straight quarters. “Buffett likes to achieve 11 percent returns,” and low-yielding cash may deprive Berkshire of billions of dollars annually, said Robert Miles, an author of books about Buffett. But George Morgan, a finance professor at the University of Nebraska Omaha, said that “as far as cash being a drag on performance, Warren would say no. Just because you’re in a store doesn’t mean you need to buy something.” Buffett has in 2017 used some Berkshire cash to become one of Apple Inc’s largest shareholders, and shore up Canadian lender Home Capital Group Inc’s finances. But he never faced the need to revisit his original deal once he clinched it.

157,KHC,Fitch Affirms The Kraft Heinz Company's IDR at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed The Kraft Heinz Company's (Kraft Heinz, or KHC) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB-' and Short-Term IDR at 'F3'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Mature Markets Limit Organic Business Growth: Kraft Heinz generated $26 billion annual revenue in 2016. Its portfolio includes eight $1 billion-plus brands and many other large and well-known household brands. Kraft Heinz is heavily exposed to the mature, highly competitive North American market which makes up about 80% of sales and EBITDA. In addition, another 9% of its revenue comes from Europe, which is facing significant macro headwinds. Organic growth trends remain challenging for large packaged foods companies across most developed economies, due to brand maturity and changing consumer preferences. For the first half of 2017 (1H17), Kraft Heinz's organic sales were down by 1.8%, after reporting 0.3% growth in 2016. Fitch expects full-year 2017 top-line growth to be mildly negative. Beyond 2017, Fitch forecasts that the overall organic growth rate will be flat to modestly positive, assuming the North American and European businesses stabilize. Significant Margin Improvement Achieved: The ratings incorporate significant qualitative benefits from the company's 51% owners, 3G Capital (3G; 24.2% ownership) and Berkshire Hathaway (Berkshire; 26.8%), who were previous owners of H.J. Heinz Company. 3G has substantially increased operating profitability and delevered acquired firms including H.J. Heinz Company (Heinz) and Restaurant Brands International, Inc. (formerly Burger King, which is now integrating the Canadian Tim Hortons chain purchased in December 2014). For example, 3G and Berkshire acquired Heinz in June 2013 and improved the company's leverage (total debt to EBITDA) to 6.2x in 2014 from 8.9x in 2013. The improvement was driven by a 35% EBITDA increase due to lower overhead and manufacturing costs and more than $1 billion in debt repayment. As of 2Q17, Kraft Heinz has achieved $1.45 billion in savings since the merger closed in July 2015, stronger than expected, and completed approximately 70% of footprint right-sizing. However, gross margin improvement in 2017 has been muted by increasing input prices. As a result, Fitch expects EBITDA to reach the low $8 billion range by 2018 versus prior expectations of around $9 billion. Progress Towards Deleveraging: The company has made strong progress to date and is on track to realize integration savings through fixed-cost and overhead reduction, rationalizing the manufacturing footprint, and realizing procurement savings from increased scale. Fitch estimates that leverage will trend towards the mid-3x range by 2019 from 5x in 2015 (on pro forma combined 2015 EBITDA of $6.7 billion), due to the combination of realizing a substantial portion of the targeted annual synergies and $2 billion of debt reduction (paydown of June 2017 maturities). Consolidating Retail Landscape: The price pressure on food companies from their distribution channels is reflective of the consolidation occurring within the retail world and the threat of the European hard-discount grocers expanding in and entering the U.S. market. KHC's retail customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors, are consolidating, resulting in fewer but larger customers with greater negotiating power who are demanding lower product pricing and/or more favorable terms. Wal-Mart, for example, KHC's largest customer, accounted for 22% and 20% of its net sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, Fitch expects Amazon's potential acquisition of Whole Foods, Inc. to result in even further downward pressure on food prices given Amazon's history of driving down prices in other industries. Fitch expects Kraft Heinz to respond to these challenges by stepping up marketing investments and increasing innovation. Elevated M&A; Event Risk: It has been two years since the Kraft / Heinz merger closed in July 2015. The combined company has been able to drive leverage down from a pro forma level of 5x in 2015 to 4.3x in 2016. In February 2017, Kraft Heinz approached Unilever with an acquisition proposal for a purchase price of $143 billion. The acquisition would have increased KHC's leverage; Unilever declined the proposal. This Unilever overture affirmed Kraft Heinz's interest in seeking greater scale, geographic expansion and cost-cutting opportunities that could offset the challenging organic top-line growth environment, but would have delayed Kraft Heinz's deleveraging timeframe. DERIVATION SUMMARY The packaged food industry is highly competitive. Kraft Heinz competes with both large national and international food and beverage companies and numerous local and regional companies. It competes with both branded products and private brands on the basis of product quality, innovation, consumer preference relevancy, brand recognition and the effectiveness of its marketing programs, distribution, shelf space, merchandising support, and price. Kraft Heinz' 'BBB-' rating reflects the company's large scale with $26 billion in annual sales, industry-leading EBITDA margins of approximately 29%, and elevated leverage after the Kraft/Heinz merger. Compared to other packaged foods companies that are in Fitch's public rating coverage universe, Kraft Heinz has the largest scale, highest EBITDA margin, and a total Debt/EBITDA leverage ratio of 4.3x as of December 2016, reflecting merger-related debt. General Mills ('BBB+'/ Negative Outlook) had annual revenue of $15.6 billion and was levered at 2.8x total Debt/EBITDA as of December 2016. Kellogg ('BBB'/Stable Outlook) had annual revenue of $13 billion and was levered at 3.3x total Debt/EBITDA as of December 2016. Mondelez ('BBB'/Stable Outlook) had annual revenue of $25.9 billion and was levered at 3.7x total Debt/EBITDA as of December 2016. Conagra ('BBB-'/Positive Outlook) had annual revenue of $7.8 billion and was levered at 1.9x total Debt/EBITDA as of May 2017. Fitch expects Kraft Heinz to benefit from its scale, continue to generate strong cash flow, and steadily pay down debt associated with the merger. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: -- 2017 revenue of approximately $26 billion, reflecting flat organic top-line growth and minor FX headwinds. Revenue is expected to grow with a flat to modestly positive organic growth rate thereafter, assuming neutral currency. -- Fitch expects EBITDA margin to exceed 30% and reach $8 billion by 2018 as the company realizes full run-rate of $1.7 billion in targeted cost synergies. -- FCF (after dividends) is expected to be modestly negative in 2017 primarily due to significant integration cash charges and capex. Fitch expects FCF to turn positive and could increase significantly from 2018 onwards as cash charges decline. -- No share repurchases assumed in the forecast period. -- Fitch estimates that leverage will trend towards a mid-3x range by 2019 due to a combination of moderate EBITDA growth and $2 billion of debt reduction (repayment of 2017 maturities). Fitch assumed the latest refinancing of term loan and commercial paper (CP) to be leverage-neutral. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action -- Over the long term, a positive rating action could be supported by flat to modestly positive organic growth, substantial and growing EBITDA and FCF generation, along with meaningful debt reduction that takes leverage below 3.5x. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action -- Sustained top-line weakness and potential market share loss in major categories; -- Inability to achieve targeted cost synergies, leading to insufficient FCF or cash on hand to pay down debt, which results in total debt/EBITDA sustaining above 4x over the medium term; -- A sizeable debt-financed acquisition that limits the company's ability to return leverage to under 4x 24-36 months post-transaction. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: Kraft Heinz's key sources of liquidity are its $4 billion revolving credit facility (RCF) maturing in 2021, and cash on hand. As of July 1, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 billion ($0.9 billion based outside of the U.S.) in addition to its $4 billion undrawn senior unsecured RCF. Capital Structure: As of July 1, 2017, Kraft Heinz had total debt outstanding of $30.8 billion, including $1.1 billion CP outstanding, $1.4 billion senior secured debt, and $28.3 billion senior unsecured debt. During 2Q17, the company paid down $2 billion of senior unsecured bonds that matured in June 2017. On Aug. 7, 2017, Kraft Heinz issued $1.5 billion of senior unsecured floating notes, and used the proceeds to repay all amounts outstanding under the $600 million term loan facility which matures in July 2022, refinance a portion of the CP outstanding, and for other general corporate purposes. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch as affirmed Kraft Heinz's ratings as follows: The Kraft Heinz Company (Parent) --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB-'. Kraft Heinz Foods Company --Long-term IDR at 'BBB-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F3'; --Commercial paper at 'F3' --$4 billion unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB-' --$1.2 billion second-lien secured notes due February 2025 at 'BBB' (legacy Heinz). Kraft Canada (operating subsidiary) --Long-term IDR at 'BBB-'; --CAD Senior Unsecured notes at 'BBB-'. H.J. Heinz Finance UK Plc. --$125 million GBP 6.25% second-lien secured notes due February 2030 at 'BBB' (legacy Heinz). Fitch also withdrew the 'BBB-' rating for the $600 million term loan at Kraft Heinz Foods Company which was refinanced by the recently issued senior unsecured notes. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

158,KHC,UPDATE 4-WPP suffers worst day since 1998 after consumer goods groups cut spending,"LONDON (Reuters) - WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising group, cut its sales target for the second time in six months on Wednesday after consumer goods giants curbed spending, putting its shares on track for their worst day in 19 years.  Facing its weakest underlying revenue growth since the financial crash in 2009, WPP saw its shares fall as much as 13 percent, wiping some $2.6 billion off its market value.  Much of the problem stems from a move by packaged goods groups including Unilever (ULVR.L), Nestle (NESN.S) and Procter & Gamble (PG.N) to respond to weak growth by cutting back on advertising products such as washing powder, drinks and food. Like its rivals, WPP has also been hit by an ultra competitive environment in the United States where it lost two major contracts - VW and AT&T; - meaning the group missed its first-half net sales target by some margin. “It is difficult,” Chief Executive Martin Sorrell told Reuters. “Most of our shrinkage came in the second quarter and we couldn’t adapt fast enough for that. But we feel good about the way we’ve controlled the costs.” Sorrell noted the growing influence of activist investors in the consumer goods sector, which he felt was adding to the pressure to rein in spending and boost margins. Consumer goods clients make up around a third of WPP’s revenue.  Analysts at RBC said eight of the 10 consumer goods companies which detailed their marketing approach in the first half of the year reported a decline as a proportion of sales.  Unilever, a WPP client which fought off a $143 billion takeover bid from Kraft Heinz in February, said it was looking to cut the number of adverts created by 30 percent. In the first half of the year, its spending with ad agencies fell by 17 percent.  One of the best known businessmen in Britain, Sorrell built the advertising group from a two-man operation in a London office in 1985 to one that now dominates the industry with 205,000 people, including associates, working in 112 countries. It provides advertising, data analytics and consultancy work to brands including L’Oreal, IBM, AstraZeneca and Vodafone. While it outperformed its peers for several years after the financial downturn, it has been showing signs of strain in the last year as rivals fight for every dollar of ad spend. On Wednesday it reported first-half like-for-like net sales down by 0.5 percent, below a consensus of 0.7 percent growth. It cut its full-year underlying net sales growth target to between flat and 1 percent, from a previous forecast of 2 percent. Like peers Omnicom (OMC.N) and IPG (IPG.N), net sales were particularly weak in the U.S.. French group Publicis (PUBP.PA), recovering from several years of subdued trading, is one of the few ad groups to fare better in the U.S., posting decent results in July. While some analysts had forecast a weak set of results, the scale of the downturn took the market by surprise and the stock is now down 23 percent in the year to date.       “As we feared, WPP’s results did indeed surprise negatively and the scale of the slowdown was more than feared,” Citi analysts said in a note to clients.  Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, said the shareprice reaction was overdone. “At a thematic level there is little that is different than anything management commented on at the time of the last quarter’s results,” he said.   Tight cost controls helped the group to reiterate its target for a 0.3 point improvement in its operating margin, and net new business billings were up against last year. WPP first rattled investors in March when it cut its 2017 sales forecast. From 3.1 percent net sales growth in 2016, it set a 2017 target of 2 percent to reflect “tepid” economic growth before it reduced it further on Wednesday.  Challenges on the horizon include the strength of Google and Facebook in digital advertising. While some marketers work  directly with the two giants, cutting out the middleman, the appearance of expensive ads alongside hate speech or extreme content has helped reinforce the need for traditional ad groups.  Consultancies such as Accenture and Deloitte are also competing in the provision of data analytics.  WPP said on Wednesday that Google and Facebook were major media clients, and that while the consultancies had acquired some small digital agencies, there was little evidence so far of them making major inroads. “The most significant pressures on client spending seems to be the impact of low growth and cheap money driving asset purchases, consolidation and zero-based budgeting,” it said, in reference to the private-equity approach to cost control.

7,KHC,Unilever sales fall short as competition bites big brands,"LONDON (Reuters) - Unilever (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS) reported disappointing third-quarter sales having lost market share to smaller rivals, dampening hopes that a failed takeover bid by Kraft Heinz (KHC.O) would spark a swift improvement in performance. Underlying sales rose only 2.6 percent, Unilever said on Thursday. That was below the 3.9 percent growth expected by analysts, and the 3 percent seen in the first half of the year. The company expressed optimism, however, about the auction of its shrinking margarine and spreads business, which  officially kicked off last month. First-round bids, expected to reach around $8 billion, are due on Thursday, according to sources familiar with the matter. Unilever’s shares fell 5 percent, having risen by a third since Kraft’s failed $143 billion takeover bid for the maker of Magnum ice cream and Dove soap in February. The company blamed poor weather in Europe, hurricanes in the United States and earthquakes in Mexico for disrupting sales. But it also cited the growing threat from local competitors in markets such as U.S. ice cream, where it lost market share to Halo Top, a new low-calorie brand capitalizing on growing demand for healthier products and niche names. That change in consumer tastes, along with the embrace of online shopping, subscription services and home delivery plans, is eating away at the traditional dominance of multinationals like Unilever, Nestle and Danone (DANO.PA). Swiss rival Nestle (NESN.S) reported accelerated third-quarter sales on Thursday, but said increased restructuring costs would weigh on margins. “Life is becoming more difficult for the consumer goods giants,” said Charlie Higgins, fund manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, which owns Unilever shares.  “To succeed in the long term Unilever will need to adapt its business model, becoming more agile and responsive to changing trends.” Unilever has made 18 acquisitions since 2015, but is still struggling.  “Our competitiveness has dropped off a little,” Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said. The company is only gaining market share in about half of its business, he said, down from about 60 percent in previous years. The sale of the margarine and spreads business is progressing well, Pitkethly said. He called media reports mentioning potential offers from private equity consortia “interesting”. He said the company was also looking forward to possible interest from industry players and those looking for exposure to specific markets.  “We’ve got three or four large groups there,” Pitkethly told Reuters about the private equity funds. “But we’re also interested to see what comes in from strategics and ... what comes in around our emerging market business. It gets real interesting from now on.” Pitkethly said Unilever still plans to spin off the business, which makes Flora and Stork margarines, if it cannot get a good price in a sale. Bankers are working on debt financings of up to 5 billion euros to back the sale, banking sources said. Unilever lifted its profitability target in July as it sought to prove it can deliver better near-term returns as a standalone company. That sparked concern that lower spending on marketing would hurt sales growth in the future.     Pitkethly said the quarter came up about 150 million euros, or about one day’s worth of sales, short of internal hopes.  “We’re not happy with that in aggregate. In fact, we feel we left some runs in the field,” Pitkethly said. Hurricanes caused about a week’s worth of lost sales in Texas and Florida, its biggest U.S. markets, he said. Unilever’s ice cream business, which also includes Ben & Jerry’s and Wall’s, saw double-digit declines in Europe, hurt by poor weather. Unilever had reduced its advertising and marketing spending by 130 basis points in the first half of the year, in an effort to cut costs in the wake of Kraft’s bid.      It said on Thursday that its reduced competitiveness was not due to the lower spending or focus on margin growth. “The slower pace of growth raises questions as to whether big FMCG players in general are able to compete with smaller, more agile local players who are launching more on-trend products,” said Liberum analyst Robert Waldschmidt.      Turnover fell by 1.6 percent, hurt by a 5.1 percent hit from foreign exchange rates, the company said. The company stood by its full-year forecast for sales growth of 3 to 5 percent, an improvement in underlying operating margin of at least 100 basis points and strong cash flow.

9,KHC,Thursday Morning Briefing,"Senate Republicans are poised to approve a measure that would help pass Trump’s tax reforms, a special report lifts the lid on a backroom battle threatening a $230 million cryptocurrency venture and thirty years on from the 1987 stock market crash, cautious traders wonder if it could happen again.  President Donald Trump’s drive to overhaul the U.S. tax code is headed for a pivotal moment, with Senate Republicans poised to approve a budget measure that would help them pass tax legislation without Democratic support.    Trump has selected Joseph Simons, an antitrust attorney from a Washington law firm, to head the Federal Trade Commission, a White House official said. Trump is expected to nominate Simons to the agency, along with Noah Phillips and Rohit Chopra to be FTC commissioners. Read the exclusive.    ‘The check has been sent’: That was the message from the White House after the father of a slain U.S. Army sergeant said a generous offer from Trump had not materialized.    Thirty years ago, before heading to work at the New York Stock Exchange, Peter Kenny left his home in lower Manhattan and made a detour a church to pray to St. Jude, the Roman Catholic patron saint of desperate and lost causes. “Blessed mother get me through this,” he prayed. The reason was the stock market crash known as “Black Monday” - the worst trading day in U.S. history.   On the 30th anniversary of the 1987 crash, U.S. stocks are at a record high and investors are concerned that steep valuations may mean a correction is overdue, despite healthy corporate earnings and economic growth. Could a repeat of “Black Monday” happen today?    Reuters TV: Life after the 1987 crash - 30 years on    World stocks set a fresh record high before stalling in Europe, as the longest winning streak for Japanese stocks since 1998 and the first close above 23,000 for Wall Street’s Dow index helped to offset nerves in Spain.   Three Japanese automakers said they found no safety issues with aluminum parts made by Kobe Steel, allaying some concerns that falsified quality data on products from the steelmaker had compromised their vehicles.    Unilever reported lower-than-expected third-quarter sales, losing market share to smaller competitors and dampening hopes that an aborted takeover offer from Kraft Heinz would spark a swift improvement.    Investors are betting on China’s potential to feed the global pharmaceutical pipeline, putting a multi-billion-dollar price tag on a handful of stocks, even as the country struggles to close a huge R&D gap with the West.    Swiss food giant Nestle expects organic sales growth to stay muted in the fourth quarter and is speeding up its restructuring program as it seeks to improve profit margins.    Breakingviews - Global watchdogs may curb U.S. deregulatory push    The people running the Tezos blockchain project collected millions in a wildly successful fundraiser, but the project has yet to get off the ground and arguments are rife behind the scenes. Reuters investigates Tezos and takes a closer look at the risks of investing in ICOs.    More Reuters fintech coverage.  Top Chinese officials have praised President Xi Jinping’s political ideology unveiled at a key Communist Party Congress, an indication that he could cement his power with his new slogan being incorporated into the party’s constitution.    Spain’s central government threatened to suspend Catalonia’s autonomy after the region’s leader said it could go ahead with a formal declaration of independence if Madrid continued its “repression”.    The Afghan Taliban stormed a military base in the south of the country killing at least 43 troops, the Defence Ministry said, with the militants putting the toll at at least 60.    As Japan prepares to vote in Sunday’s national election, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has called North Korea’s escalating threats -- it also conducted a sixth nuclear test last month -- a “national crisis” that only he can lead Japan through. Yet the missiles that flew over a fishing town on Japan’s northern island of Hokkaido on Aug. 29 and Sept. 15 created an eerie threat: No one saw or heard them. They streaked by several hundred kilometers above land, too high to see with the naked eye, before splashing into the Pacific more than 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) to the east.   Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards said its ballistic missile program would accelerate despite U.S. and European Union pressure to suspend it, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.   New Zealand’s next prime minister will be Jacinda Ardern, whose Labour party won the support of a small nationalist party to form the government, spelling big changes for a small but open economy, whose currency hit a 4-1/2-month low on the news.   Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta snubbed a crisis meeting called by the chairman of the election board for Thursday, saying he would instead spend the day campaigning for next week’s presidential vote re-run.   Most of the framers of the U.S. Constitution would probably be appalled by Trump's decision to sign an executive order undermining the Affordable Care Act, writes Scott Lemieux. ""But in terms of formal executive power, there’s ample precedent for Trump’s actions."" The expansion, and sometimes misuse, of executive power, says Lemieux, ""is a result produced in large measure by the framers’ choices to dilute accountability and responsibility in the federal government, and their designing a presidential system in which a minority party can regularly win."" ",10192017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-newsnow-oct19/thursday-morning-briefing-idUSKBN1CO1GA
10,KHC,Breakingviews - Unilever struggle gives hope to predators,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Unilever’s struggle gives hope to predators. The consumer giant that fended off a bid from Kraft Heinz earlier this year reported weak third-quarter sales on Thursday. Chief Executive Paul Polman is sprucing up brands, but the more pedestrian Unilever’s performance, the more vulnerable it becomes. The maker of pot-noodles blamed factors beyond its control for a weak third quarter, which saw sales excluding disposals and acquisitions rise by 2.6 percent, well short of analysts’ expectations of 3.9 percent. The hot summer meant people ate less ice cream, while hurricanes disrupted spending and shipping. Yet the figures also reflect longer-term challenges. Growth in developed economies is slow, and health-conscious customers are changing their habits, meaning consumer goods companies cannot rely on old brands. One example: Halo Top, a family-owned healthy ice cream brand, grabbed share in North America. Unilever reckons just half its products took a bigger slice of their respective markets, down from around 60 percent in previous years.  Polman is making the right calls. He is selling dying brands, like margarine, buying new ones, and finding fresh ways of distributing products, like direct-to-consumer subscription services. And while the outlook in Europe and North America is dull, emerging economies are growing quickly. Unilever is also pushing up margins: analysts expect the company to convert 20 percent of sales into operating profit by 2020. Still, Polman can’t rest easy. Unilever will need a strong fourth quarter if it is to meet its target for sales growth of 3 to 5 percent this year. More disappointments could revive takeover interest. Investors might look more favourably on Kraft Heinz’s near-30 percent operating margin if Unilever’s growth remains little better than average. Activist investors who are taking on ever-bigger targets such as Procter & Gamble, might also see the company as a candidate for deeper cost cutting and more radical surgery. Unilever’s battles are far from over. ",10192017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-unilever-outlook-breakingviews/breakingviews-unilever-struggle-gives-hope-to-predators-idUSKBN1CO1E5

13,KHC,Kraft Heinz misses sales estimates as U.S. demand weakens,"(Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) marginally missed Wall Street sales estimates in the third quarter and warned it would be hampered in the fourth by many U.S. consumers working through emergency hurricane stores of its tinned goods. Excluding items, net profit at North America’s third-largest food and beverage company, came in at 83 cents per share, marginally better than a consensus of 82 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The 0.3 percent dip in U.S. revenue, however, compared to rises for other packaged food companies and came at a time when the firm is struggling with the shift by consumers and retailers away from its processed food toward fresh produce.  Shares of the company, which is backed by billionaire-investor Warren Buffett and private equity firm 3G Capital, fell 1.5 percent in after-market trading. “There’s no question that the retail environment, particularly in the United States, will remain both dynamic and challenging,” Chief Executive Bernardo Hees said.  The company said organic U.S. sales growth would take another 30 basis point hit from the loading of pantries in southern states in the third quarter in advance of hurricanes Irma, Harvey and Maria.  It blamed the dip in the third quarter - the sixth straight quarterly fall in sales - in part on problems with shipments of cold cuts that would also affect sales in the fourth quarter. Other packaged food companies have experienced a revival in North American sales this quarter with Mondelez (MDLZ.O) reporting a 1.3 percent rise in revenue while Hershey (HSY.N) posted a 1.6 percent rise. Like other processed packaged food makers, Kraft Heinz has been grappling with an increasing number of Americans preferring healthier, non-processed foods, rather than preservative-heavy packaged foods. To compound their woes, the major customers of traditional packaged food manufacturers, such as grocer Kroger (KR.N), are shifting shelf space to higher-margin private-label brands. The company said it would make efforts in partnering with retailers to attract consumers from non-traditional channels including e-commerce. Kraft, which at the start of this year targetted a $1.7 billion cut in costs by the end of 2017, said selling, general and administrative expenses fell about 19 percent to $653 million in the reported quarter. JP Morgan analysts were disappointed by the results.  “In sum, the numbers were a bit less robust than what we had hoped for, and margins were softer than what we had modeled in all segments,” they said in a note on the results.

23,KHC,Brexit spurs near doubling of UK domestic deal-making,"* Volume of UK domestic M&A; jumps to $68 billion in 2017 * Inbound and outbound UK deal volumes slip * Companies bulking up to counter uncertainty By Ben Martin LONDON, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Companies seeking to “bulk up” to offset the uncertainty caused by Britain’s looming EU exit helped to spur a near doubling of domestic mergers and acquisition activity this year, according to Thomson Reuters data. The volume of UK domestic deals surged to $68 billion from $34.3 billion in 2016 as the number of deals between British groups jumped from 1,480 to 1,681, the highest level since 2008, the data show. They included online gambling company GVC’s purchase of bookmaker Ladbrokes Coral for as much as 3.9 billion pounds ($5.24 billion) and Hammerson’s 3.4 billion pound acquisition of rival shopping centre operator Intu Properties. It comes against a backdrop of often fractious Brexit negotiations between London and Brussels this year, talks that are yet to provide businesses with clarity about Britain’s future relationship with Europe. Bosses at British companies have also been eyeing new U.S. President Donald Trump, whose decisions have repercussions for businesses around the world. “At the beginning of 2017 there were a lot of questions about what was going to happen to the M&A; market, given the global uncertainty caused by Brexit and the new U.S. president,” said Nick Cline, a London-based M&A; partner at law firm Latham & Watkins, who said the uncertain environment had acted as a driver for some deals rather than stifling activity. “There are a lot of corporates out there in the UK and Europe who are seeing the changing landscape and as a result are even more focused on what they’re going to do to be tomorrow’s leaders.” The jump in domestic deal-making contrasted with falls in both inbound and outbound UK M&A; volumes, the data show, with the former slipping 12.9 percent to $115.1 billion and the latter down 9.4 percent to $112.5 billion. That meant overall M&A; volumes with any UK involvement dipped 0.7 percent to $375 billon, a softer decline than the 1.4 percent slide in global deal volumes to $3.5 trillion, according to the data. Philip Noblet, HSBC’s co-head of global banking in the UK, said that “a lot of the obvious sector consolidation deals that people expected to happen” were struck this year and were “driven by the Brexit climate which is prompting companies to bulk up”. However, a dearth of blockbuster deals meant that overall M&A; volumes involving any British companies remained much lower than in 2015, when they totalled $605.5 billion, swelled by Anheuser-Busch Inbev’s $110 billion acquisition of FTSE 100 brewer SABMiller and Royal Dutch Shell’s $53 billion tie-up with BG Group. “It’s hard to see how any more of the really big deals are going to happen going forward without there being quite significant competition issues,” said Noblet. Kraft Heinz’s $143 billion attempt to buy consumer goods giant Unilever in February, which would have been one such megadeal, failed within days when the U.S. food company walked away after the FTSE 100 business rejected its offer. Potential British government scrutiny of the deal was a concern raised during talks between the two companies, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters at the time. Since Theresa May became prime minister in July 2016, Britain has taken a more cautious approach towards foreign acquisitions of British assets. In October, the government proposed new rules to give it more say over deals in the defence and technology sectors, although Cline said the government’s change of tack had not represented “a step-change this year in the way the UK looks at deals”. He said: “Occasionally a transaction comes up where there’s a question about UK government intervention.” Cline forecasts that British M&A; activity will remain strong in 2018, while Jan Skarbek, managing director of UK banking and broking at Citigroup, also thinks there will be an increase. “Organic growth is very difficult in this environment and staying still is not an option for many companies,” he said. “So I think there will be more deals next year, despite the geopolitical uncertainty.” ($1 = 0.7446 pounds) (Reporting by Ben Martin; Editing by Adrian Croft)",12292017,http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-eu-ma/brexit-spurs-near-doubling-of-uk-domestic-deal-making-idUSL8N1OS1FV
24,KHC,UPDATE 1-JBS names former Kraft Heinz executive CEO of Plumrose USA,"(dds information from statement, quote and background on JBS) SAO PAULO, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Brazil-based meatpacker JBS SA said Thomas Lopez had been appointed chief executive of subsidiary Plumrose USA amid efforts to strengthen the business globally, according to a securities filing on Wednesday. Lopez is a former executive of Kraft Heinz Co and has 18 years of experience in the food industry, JBS said. Plumrose USA produces bacon, lunch meats, and sliced deli meats. The appointment comes amid efforts from the U.S.-based company to strengthen its position outside of Brazil, where it is headquartered. The world’s biggest meat processor and owner of global brands such as Pilgrim’s Pride and Swift, JBS reported about $10 billion in net revenue from subsidiaries overseas in the third quarter, about 75 percent of the group’s total. In Brazil, the company’s former chairman and chief executive, brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista, whose family founded and still controls JBS, have been jailed on graft and insider trading claims.

25,KHC,UPDATE 4-Melrose says rising shares show the value of its GKN bid,"(Reuters) - A sharp rise in both companies’ share prices shows the merit of Melrose’s (MRON.L) bid for engineer GKN GKN.L, the turnaround specialist said on Thursday, seeking to win over GKN investors to its hostile 7.4 billion pound ($10.3 billion) offer.  Melrose was responding on Thursday to earlier criticism of its cash-and-shares offer from the much larger GKN, a British firm that makes parts for the Boeing 737 jet, Black Hawk helicopter and components for Volkswagen and Ford cars. GKN, which traces its roots back to the 18th century, said Melrose’s claim to be offering its shareholders a 32 percent premium was “fake”, not least because most of the cash for the proposed deal would effectively be funded by GKN investors. With a much higher debt-to-core earnings ratio, Melrose would be using GKN to leverage up the combined business to fund the cash part of its offer, GKN said.  GKN, which has set out an alternative plan to split itself into separate aerospace and automotive businesses, said the real premium being offered by Melrose was less than 11 percent.  Melrose, however, defended its takeover plan. “In less than a week shareholders have seen 104 pence per share or 1.8 billion pounds added to the value of GKN which shareholders can, if they wish, realise today in the market,”  Melrose Chief Executive Simon Peckham said in a statement.  “Melrose’s actions have done that, not GKN’s management”, Peckham added. Melrose pounced on GKN after problems at the engineer’s aerospace division led to profit warnings in October and November, sparking a sharp share price fall. Its offer of 1.49 new Melrose shares and 81 pence in cash for each GKN share is currently worth around 431 pence per GKN share. GKN shares closed at 445 pence on Thursday. Melrose’s bid is one of the biggest hostile takeover attempts in Britain since Kraft bought chocolate maker Cadbury in 2009. Pfizer’s attempt to buy AstraZeneca in 2014 and Kraft Heinz’s tilt at Unilever last year were both abandoned after successful defense plans were put up by the target companies.    BREAK-UP  Melrose, whose business model is to buy engineering companies, improve their margins and resell them, already owns diversified firm Nortek and the Brush electricity generating equipment businesses. GKN said on Thursday that Melrose’s board had “very limited experience ... of managing Tier 1 aerospace and automotive suppliers.” “GKN is more than five times larger than any of Melrose’s prior acquisitions by revenue,” GKN chief executive Anne Stevens said in a statement.  GKN also refuted Melrose’s suggestion that it was rushing into a break up, saying the timing of the separation “will be determined by the need to maximize the economic benefits and minimize the costs associated with separation”. A source familiar with the situation said earlier this week that Elliott Advisors, which has a small interest in GKN, thinks it should open talks with Melrose, though the fund considers the existing offer unattractive. A regulatory filing on Thursday showed Elliott cut its interest in GKN to 0.5 percent after Melrose went hostile with its bid on Wednesday, from the previously disclosed 1.7 percent.  Another fund, Vulcan, has also trimmed its interest in GKN to 3.9 percent from 4.1 percent, a separate filing showed. The Financial Times reported on Monday that Vulcan wanted GKN to hold discussions with its suitor.    Melrose bought engineering firm Elster for 1.8 billion pounds in 2012, selling it to Honeywell Inc for 3.3 billion pounds three years later. It returned 2.4 billion pounds to shareholders in 2016.  Melrose has some experience of aerospace businesses after buying McKechnie, a manufacturer of aerospace components, and Dynacast, which makes small engineered precision components, in 2005. It sold its aerospace and aftermarket businesses in 2007. Rothschild, RBC Europe and Investec are advising Melrose, while GKN is working with Gleacher Shacklock, JPMorgan Cazenove and UBS.

27,KHC,LPC-Thirteen banks bag debt mandate for Unilever spreads buy,"LONDON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Thirteen banks have been mandated on a €5.65bn-equivalent debt financing backing US private equity firm KKR’s €6.83bn acquisition of Unilever’s margarine and spreads business, banking sources said. Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and KKR Capital Markets are leading the debt financing, alongside BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, ING, Lloyds, Mizuho, RBC, Societe Generale and UniCredit, the sources said. “It’s a long line up of banks but it’s a deal everyone wanted to be on and there is a pretty sizeable revolver,” one of the sources said. The debt financing will include a €3.9bn-equivalent seven-year covenant lite term loan — which will be mainly denominated in euros and will include some US dollars, sterling and Polish zloty — as well as €1.050bn of senior unsecured notes and a €700m revolving credit facility, the sources said. The debt financing is expected to launch for syndication in the first half of February, the sources said. The brands of the margarine and spreads business include Becel, Flora, Country Crock and Blue Band. Unilever put the business up for sale in April 2017, following a review of its assets prompted by February’s unsolicited US$143bn takeover attempt by Kraft Heinz. KKR has a long history in the consumer sector and it has investments in India’s Coffee Day Resorts and Chinese white goods maker Qingdao Haier. Last year, KKR bought a majority control of vitamin maker Nature’s Bounty.

29,KHC,LPC-Banks to launch €4.6bn loan backing KKR’s Unilever spreads buy,"LONDON (Reuters) - Banks are expected to launch a 4.6 billion euro-equivalent leveraged loan within the next week that backs U.S. private equity firm KKR’s acquisition of Unilever’s margarine and spreads business, banking sources said. KKR agreed to buy the unit for 6.83 billion euros, it was announced in December, backed with a 5.65 billion euro-equivalent leveraged loan and bond financing. The highly anticipated 3.9 billion euro-equivalent seven-year covenant-lite term loan — which will be mainly denominated in euros and will include some U.S. dollars, sterling and Polish zloty — is set to launch for syndication to investors shortly, followed by a sale of 1.050 billion euros of senior unsecured notes. The financing also comprises a 700 million euro revolving credit facility. A bank meeting is expected for next week and pricing on the euro term loan is expected with a three handle, the sources said. The 3.9 billion euro facility will become the largest single-tranche euro-denominated term loan B since the financial crisis, outstripping a 1.86 billion euro seven-year term loan B backing Hellman & Friedman’s 33.1 billion Danish krone($5.3 billion) take-private of Danish payments firm Nets. Unilever’s term loan is expected to attract significant investor attention, due to its large size and high profile. It also launches at a time when the market is relatively quiet. Despite a busy January, when the market processed a large number of leveraged loans, supply has since waned, with only a handful of deals. The pipeline is building but it is unlikely that Unilever will experience competition from any of the larger loans still to be syndicated. A 2.35 billion pound loan backing multinational sports betting and gaming group GVC Holdings’ acquisition of UK betting group Ladbrokes Coral, is not set to launch until early March. “Unilever is so large it would command attention no matter what else is happening in the market. It is what everyone has been waiting for, however it so happens the market is relatively quiet which is going to help it even more,” a syndicate head said. Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and KKR Capital Markets are leading the debt financing, alongside BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, ING, Lloyds, Mizuho, RBC, Societe Generale and UniCredit.

30,KHC,MOVES-Deal guru Klein to join Credit Suisse board,"LONDON, Feb 14 (IFR) - Michael Klein has been nominated to be a non-executive director of Credit Suisse. Klein was previously chairman and co-chief executive of markets and banking at Citigroup until he stepped down in July 2008, weeks ahead of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, sparking the financial crisis. Since then Klein has been working as a corporate finance adviser, acting for Dow Chemical on its US$130bn merger with DuPont in 2015 and for Saudi Arabia on its planned US$100bn flotation of Saudi Aramco alongside JP Morgan. His firm, M Klein & Co, is understood to have around 20 employees. It has in the past advised several major commodities trading firms including Noble and Glencore. Last year Klein also advised Unilever on the unwanted US$143bn takeover approach from Kraft Heinz. In early 2016 Klein said Mike Eck, former global head of consumer and retail investment banking at Morgan Stanley, was a senior adviser. Former US treasury secretary Larry Summers has also worked on individual projects for the firm. At the time he said his firm wanted to provide bespoke advice to senior executives. “For any one client, we’ll provide a range of strategic activities that adds value, from advising on a multi-billion-dollar acquisition, to resolving a dispute with a critical customer to negotiating with a government in order to ensure payment of a multi-billion-dollar arbitration award,” he said. In 2008, Klein advised Barclays on its acquisition of Lehman’s main US business and acted for the UK government during the crisis. He has also advised Dubai on restructuring its Dubai World investment business. Shareholders will decide if Klein should join Credit Suisse’s board at the bank’s annual general meeting on April 27. It is unclear if his business activities will change if he is elected to the board or if he will work more closely with the bank’s senior advisory team. M Klein & Co and Credit Suisse did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Credit Suisse has also put forward Brazilian citizen Ana Paula Pessoa, an independent director of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, to join the board at the same time as Klein. Current director and US chairman Richard Thornburgh is not standing for re-election after 12 years.

35,KHC,"Kraft Heinz sees hit from rising competition, supply constraints"," (Corrects to remove reference to company limiting supplies of cold cuts to preserve margins in paragraph 10 of Feb. 16 story) By Vibhuti Sharma (Reuters) - Tater Tots-maker Kraft Heinz Co’s (KHC.O) muted quarterly results echoed those of rival Campbell Soup Co (CPB.N) as more Americans opted for healthier meals, a trend that has pressured shares of processed food makers for several quarters now. Kraft Heinz, owner of brands such as Velveeta cheese and Heinz ketchup, said on Friday that retailers in Canada were stocking fewer of their products — a factor that is likely to be permanent. The company’s shares were down 3.3 percent in afternoon trading. They earlier fell as much as 7 percent to their lowest since August 2015. “There is no question our financial results in 2017 did not meet our potential,” Kraft Heinz Chief Executive Officer Bernardo Hees said on a call with analysts. Kraft Heinz and Campbell are the worst performing large-cap consumer staples stock over the past 12 months, losing 20 percent and 25 percent, respectively. The S&P; 500 .SPX, in contrast, is up 15 percent. Other food companies have in recent months spoken about escalating pressure from retailers, who are asking suppliers to offer lower prices and limit shipments so that they can control inventories better. Food companies have tried to promote their healthier products but these have often failed to gain the sort of popularity their traditional products enjoyed. Sales in Kraft Heinz’s U.S. business fell 1.1 percent to $4.79 billion, declining for the seventh straight quarter. They missed analysts’ average estimate of $4.81 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total sales and profit for the fourth quarter fell short of estimates as well. Other issues that weighed on sales included a supply shortfall of its Ore-Ida branded potato-based foods and cold cuts. Kraft Heinz said several of these problems are likely to persist this year. Net sales inched up 0.3 percent to $6.88 billion, but missed estimates of $6.92 billion. Kraft-Heinz, the fifth-largest food and beverage company in the world, achieved its target of cutting $1.7 billion in costs by the end of 2017. “After looking at the company’s slide presentation yesterday, one might have come away with the impression that KHC is firing on all cylinders; today’s print was a reminder that the company still has a long way to go before this is the case,” JP Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said.

36,KHC,"Kraft Heinz sees hit from rising competition, supply constraints"," (Corrects to remove reference to company limiting supplies of cold cuts to preserve margins in paragraph 10 of Feb. 16 story) By Vibhuti Sharma (Reuters) - Tater Tots-maker Kraft Heinz Co’s (KHC.O) muted quarterly results echoed those of rival Campbell Soup Co (CPB.N) as more Americans opted for healthier meals, a trend that has pressured shares of processed food makers for several quarters now. Kraft Heinz, owner of brands such as Velveeta cheese and Heinz ketchup, said on Friday that retailers in Canada were stocking fewer of their products — a factor that is likely to be permanent. The company’s shares were down 3.3 percent in afternoon trading. They earlier fell as much as 7 percent to their lowest since August 2015. “There is no question our financial results in 2017 did not meet our potential,” Kraft Heinz Chief Executive Officer Bernardo Hees said on a call with analysts. Kraft Heinz and Campbell are the worst performing large-cap consumer staples stock over the past 12 months, losing 20 percent and 25 percent, respectively. The S&P; 500 .SPX, in contrast, is up 15 percent. Other food companies have in recent months spoken about escalating pressure from retailers, who are asking suppliers to offer lower prices and limit shipments so that they can control inventories better. Food companies have tried to promote their healthier products but these have often failed to gain the sort of popularity their traditional products enjoyed. Sales in Kraft Heinz’s U.S. business fell 1.1 percent to $4.79 billion, declining for the seventh straight quarter. They missed analysts’ average estimate of $4.81 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total sales and profit for the fourth quarter fell short of estimates as well. Other issues that weighed on sales included a supply shortfall of its Ore-Ida branded potato-based foods and cold cuts. Kraft Heinz said several of these problems are likely to persist this year. Net sales inched up 0.3 percent to $6.88 billion, but missed estimates of $6.92 billion. Kraft-Heinz, the fifth-largest food and beverage company in the world, achieved its target of cutting $1.7 billion in costs by the end of 2017. “After looking at the company’s slide presentation yesterday, one might have come away with the impression that KHC is firing on all cylinders; today’s print was a reminder that the company still has a long way to go before this is the case,” JP Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said.

43,KHC,Kraft Heinz launches incubator for 'disruptive' food startups,"(Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) has launched an incubator program for food and beverage startups, joining a growing list of U.S. food companies looking at new ways to spur growth as consumers shun processed packaged food in favor of healthier offerings. Kraft said on Wednesday the platform, called Springboard, will focus on supporting and developing brands that make healthy, organic and experiential products, giving them access to the company’s distribution and marketing expertise, research and development and consumer insights. Smaller, independent brands are seen by many consumers, especially younger ones, to be more hip and healthy and rather than compete with them many big food and drink companies have looked to buy into and learn from startup innovation, a leaf straight out of Silicon Valley’s playbook. Other big U.S. food makers making similar forays into the startup world include Campbell Soup Co (CPB.N), General Mills (GIS.N) and Kellog Co (K.N). As part of the program, Springboard will review applications from “disruptive” food and beverage startups, which will then receive financial support to build their brands and guidance to raise additional funding, Kraft Heinz said. Investors were positive about the new venture, but said the platform may not be enough to drive long-term sales growth for Kraft Heinz, which has a market value of about $82.6 billion. “It will take time to effect change at a company this size, and the Springboard initiative itself will not be sufficient. Nevertheless, it is a step in the right direction,” Jason Benowitz, a senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investment Group, told Reuters. Roosevelt Investment owns Kraft Heinz’s shares worth $9.8 million. Kraft Heinz’s move comes a year after Kraft Heinz walked away from a $143 billion bid for Unilever (ULVR.L) after the European consumer goods behemoth dismissed the offer as having no financial or strategic merit.

46,KHC,Unilever set to give up London HQ - Sky News,"(Reuters) - Unilever (UNc.AS) (ULVR.L) is set to abandon its British headquarters as the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant moves to a sole legal home base in the Netherlands, Sky News reported on Wednesday. A formal announcement is due on Thursday, said the report after a Wednesday board meeting to finalize the decision. Unilever was not available for comment on a decision which would unpick a business model that dates back to 1930.      The maker of Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream had last year announced a review of its dual-headed structure after rebuffing a $143 billion takeover offer from Kraft Heinz (KHC.O). A move by Unilever, the second-biggest public company by value in the Netherlands and third-biggest in Britain, would be a blow to the British government as it prepares for next year’s exit from the European Union.   Unilever has held talks with the governments of both countries in the run-up to its decision. It said last year that collapsing into a single entity would benefit the company and shareholders, partly by facilitating big-ticket M&A; deals, but it delayed a decision on location amid heightened political sensitivity caused by Brexit. In recent months, speculation about it choosing the Netherlands grew louder following the proposal of a tax change by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, himself a Unilever veteran, seen as benefiting Anglo-Dutch multinationals.       Since the 1930 merger of the Dutch margarine producer Margarine Unie and the British soap maker Lever Brothers, Unilever has operated with two parent companies - a British Plc headquartered in London and a Dutch NV based in Rotterdam. Though run as one company, the distinct legal entities have different shareholders, separate stock listings and annual meetings and are subject to different laws and corporate governance requirements. Unilever has said it planned to maintain stock market listings in the Netherlands, United Kingdom and United States and continue to apply both the UK and Dutch corporate governance codes.   It was unclear whether the company's UK-listed shares would continue to be part of the bluechip FTSE 100 .FTSE index. Some analysts point out that Dutch takeover law is more protective and speculate that a Dutch-headquartered Unilever could more easily fend off unwelcome suitors in the future. Unilever itself has said the change is about simplification, arguing a single entity would be more agile as it could more easily issue equity for large acquisitions or spin off unwanted businesses. Of Unilever’s 161,000 employees worldwide, 7,300 are in the United Kingdom and 3,100 are in the Netherlands. The UK business is based in Unilever House, a large neoclassical art deco building on the banks of the River Thames.

56,KHC,RPT-INSIGHT-Amazon.com plays catch-up in Brazil as local rivals thrive,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Brad Haynes SAO PAULO, April 25 (Reuters) - Claudia Maria de Oliveira is leery of online shopping. But while browsing social media recently, the 49-year-old Brazilian spotted a bargain-priced sandwich press from local retailer Magazine Luiza SA. She swallowed her doubts and hit the “buy” button. Two days later she picked up her first-ever online purchase at a mall in Sao Paulo. “I took the risk,” said Oliveira, who cleans offices for a living. “If I have any trouble with it, at least I know I can come back to the store.” A reassuring physical presence and fast-growing online sales have vaulted Magazine Luiza into the upper echelons of Brazilian e-commerce, lifting shares over 500 percent last year and 20 percent so far in 2018. The company is relying on deep roots in its home turf to survive an assault by Amazon.com Inc, which is revving up operations in Latin America’s largest economy six years after entering the market. Reuters has reported that Amazon is eyeing a major warehouse outside Sao Paulo, negotiating a nationwide air cargo deal and lining up local suppliers of everything from personal electronics to perfume and home appliances. But the American giant may struggle to dominate retail in Brazil as it has elsewhere, according to a dozen executives, analysts and investors interviewed by Reuters. They compare the state of Brazilian e-commerce to that of the U.S. market 10 years ago — only Amazon’s slow rollout here gave rivals a chance to prepare. Helped by Brazil’s richest man and search giant Google, competitors are copying many of Amazon’s signature moves. Those strategies have sped up delivery, earned customer loyalty and boosted offerings through partnerships with third-party sellers. And unlike Amazon, home-grown players such as Magazine Luiza have decades of experience with the country’s working-class consumers and tangles of red tape — key survival skills in Brazil’s retail jungle. “We see room for several players,” said Eduardo Carlier, a fund manager at AZ Quest Investimentos, a major shareholder in Magazine Luiza. “We think the winner-take-all model that played out in the United States is going to be tempered in Brazil.” Amazon declined to comment. With a population of more than 200 million people, Brazil is key to Amazon’s global expansion plans. But as in China and India, where it ran into strong competition, Amazon is playing catch-up in Brazil. Amazon entered Brazil quietly in 2012, peddling e-readers, books and then streaming movies in a fast-growing e-commerce market that has since doubled to $20 billion. Like a predator lurking at the edges of the market, Amazon has kept competitors uneasy, wondering when it would attack their core business. They got their answer in October, when the world’s largest online retailer opened a Brazilian marketplace for third-party sellers of an array of physical products. Shares in Magazine Luiza, rival B2W Cia Digital, and market-leading MercadoLibre Inc, fell nearly 20 percent on the news. Yet all three rebounded quickly in the following weeks. Their shares have continued to climb this year as Brazil’s economy picks up and the companies employ strategies that could have been ripped from Amazon’s own playbook. Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann and partners at 3G Capital, the investment firm behind the Kraft Heinz Co merger, have invested heavily in B2W through its brick-and-mortar parent Lojas Americanas SA. Their backing has let B2W spend aggressively on in-house logistics, a third-party marketplace and efforts to integrate operations with Lojas Americanas. In a cheeky move, B2W uses the name “Prime” for its shopping club offering fast shipping for annual membership fees, the same moniker used by Amazon for a similar service in other markets. Amazon uses “Prime” only for its streaming video offerings in Brazil. Another online rival, MercadoLibre, was founded in Buenos Aires two decades ago to replicate the eBay Inc marketplace model across Latin America. It has held its own against Amazon in Mexico and leads the Brazilian market in online sales, according to market research firm Euromonitor. Its Brazil unit grew 80 percent last year, providing nearly 60 percent of net revenue. Last year, MercadoLibre opened a warehouse near Sao Paulo to store and ship third-party goods, accelerating delivery using a model similar to the pioneering “Fulfilled by Amazon” service. Brazilian retailers are also getting an assist from Silicon Valley. Alphabet Inc’s Google briefed its Brazilian advertisers last year on Amazon’s forays into markets such as India and Mexico to help them prepare, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Google’s head of retail in Brazil, Claudia Sciama, acknowledged that Brazilian clients had been asking what a ramp-up by Amazon could mean. “What we’ve done is an exploratory study to understand how they might enter different markets,” Sciama said. She declined to provide details. Few Brazilian retailers have done as much to reinvent themselves in recent years as Magazine Luiza. Founded six decades ago as a gift shop in the shoemaking hub of Franca, in Sao Paulo state, the unpretentious retailer became a national player in the 1990s selling appliances, furniture and electronics on credit to poor families ignored by bigger chains. Chairwoman Luiza Trajano started on the sales floor as a teenager and in 1991 took over the company founded by her aunt. She steered it to a public listing in 2011, expanding operations to more than 800 locations across the country at present. Yet Magazine Luiza’s digital leap, with her son at the helm, may be the most dramatic transformation yet. Frederico Trajano launched e-commerce operations in 2000 and has made it the company’s central focus since becoming CEO in January 2016. Using brick-and-mortar stores as delivery hubs to cut costs and win over wary online shoppers, Trajano is accelerating both internet sales and new store openings. Digital sales channels grew 61 percent last year to make up nearly a third of revenue, while profit more than quadrupled. Magazine Luiza plans to open about 100 new stores this year, up from nearly 60 in 2017, according to two people familiar with the matter. The company has said it may open more stores in 2018 than last year. For Trajano, those outlets form the backbone of his digital strategy, putting inventory closer to consumers and cutting the cost of storage and order processing. Trajano said fulfillment consumes up to 15 percent of Brazilian e-commerce revenue, compared to as little as 8 percent in the United States, due to Brazil’s lousy infrastructure, high borrowing costs and lower levels of automation. Each new store is “a free distribution center,” Trajano said in an interview at Magazine Luiza’s unassuming headquarters by a highway in Sao Paulo. “Why do you think Amazon bought Whole Foods?” he said. To be sure, Trajano’s vision of seamless integration between e-commerce and physical stores is a work in progress. When shopper Oliveira went to fetch her sandwich press, she joined a line of impatient customers waiting at the Aricanduva shopping mall on the gritty east side of Sao Paulo. In the back room, Magazine Luiza staff hunted for her order on shelves piled with plates, shampoo, microwaves and tires. On a February analyst call, Trajano acknowledged the company’s stores need to be better retrofitted to handle the flow of online orders. Magazine Luiza is also sharpening its home delivery operation. The company has around 1,500 dedicated truckers running its own app, updating routes and communicating with sellers, warehouses, stores and customers in real time. Trajano lauds Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as “the best CEO in the world,” but said his company will face a steep learning curve in Brazil, given its notoriously tough business climate. Case in point: Brazilian consumers have long paid sales taxes on online purchases, unlike in the United States, where internet commerce got a break in its early years. “If there’s one thing the Brazilian government knows how to do, it’s collect taxes,” Trajano said.

58,KHC,"Kraft Heinz profit boosted by pricing, U.S. tax changes","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co’s (KHC.O) quarterly profit beat expectations as the Tater Tots-maker benefited from tax changes in the United States and raised prices to counter higher input costs, sending shares up 4 percent after the bell. Food companies, including Conagra Brands Inc (CAG.N) and General Mills Inc (GIS.N), have flagged higher transportation costs and rising commodities prices in recent months. These companies are also are under pressure to boost sales while the struggling retailers they sell products to clamp down on prices and inventory. Kraft Heinz, whose brands include Velveeta cheese and Heinz ketchup, said it raised prices in the United States and in other parts of the world, driving overall pricing up by 1 percentage point. Pricing was positive for the third straight quarter. Net income rose 11.1 percent to $993 million, or 81 cents per share, primarily reflecting benefits from the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in over 30 years, which slashed the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Excluding items, earnings were 89 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 82 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales slipped 0.3 percent to $6.30 billion in the first quarter ended March 31 as weakening demand for processed foods in the United States more than offset growth in Canada, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Sales missed expectations of $6.33 billion.  Kraft Heinz has reported muted sales for several straight quarters as U.S. retailers make space on their shelves for fresh food and higher-margin upstart brands such as Sir Kensington’s or Portlandia Foods.  Kraft Heinz’s stock has lost 42 percent in value since its failed takeover bid for Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) last year. Its private equity backer 3G is known for driving sales through acquisitions. “If another deal isn’t imminent, what’s the next phase of growth? They’re under pressure to deliver sales,” Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said, noting frustration and impatience among shareholders about the company’s empty merger and acquisition pipeline. To prove to investors that it can grow through innovation, Kraft Heinz has been investing in e-commerce and food and beverage startups, joining a growing list of U.S. food companies looking at new ways to spur growth. Finance chief David Knopf said the rise in first-quarter pricing also helped make up for higher expenses from the company’s aggressive commercial investment plans. Changing consumer habits and retail industry woes due to online competition are some of the hurdles to Kraft Heinz making an acquisition, Weissman added.

63,KHC,Kraft Heinz seeks buzz for big brands as rivals' valuations come down,"OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Ketchup, bologna and Jell-O don’t excite Wall Street. But a big deal might whet its appetite for Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O). Many analysts believe Kraft Heinz, controlled by Brazil’s 3G Capital and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), needs a blockbuster acquisition to foster growth. And its energetic chief executive, Bernardo Hees, is under pressure to manage Street expectations. While he says he is in no rush to do deals, does not need a big acquisition now, and is not talking much with investment bankers, opportunities may be coming. “Our M&A; framework has not changed,” Hees, 48, said in an interview at Berkshire’s recent annual shareholder weekend in Omaha, Nebraska. “We continue to like big brands. We continue to like businesses that can travel. We continue to like businesses that we can find synergies that we can reinvest behind growth. “The relative and absolute valuations are more attractive today than they were six months ago, or a year ago,” Hees added. “If more consolidation would happen in the food and beverage industry, we want to be a force.” Hees (pronounced “Hess”) is a partner at 3G, which is known for engineering big mergers, such as the creation of Restaurant Brands International Inc (QSR.TO) by combining Burger King with Canada’s Tim Hortons, and then imposing draconian cost cuts. That reputation helped prompt Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream maker Unilever Plc (UNc.AS) to rebuff 3G’s $143 billion Buffett-backed takeover approach last year. Kraft Heinz decided to walk away, and Hees is not dwelling on the rejection. For now, his challenge is to create buzz for familiar brands such as Oscar Mayer and Velveeta, and not just for products capable of riding the newest food trends. The company eliminated $1.7 billion of costs, including six factories and about 4,900 jobs, following the 2015 merger of Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz. The combined company is co-headquartered in Chicago and Pittsburgh. “Big brands have scale, they have profitability, they allow you to grow when you have the right product offerings, and it’s relevant,” said Hees, who previously led Heinz and Burger King. So as Kraft Heinz takes celebrity chef David Chang’s Momofuku Ssam Sauce national, and partners with Food Network on “globally inspired” salad dressings, cooking sauces and meal kits, so too it must inspire consumers to fill their pantries with Planters Signature nuts and Philadelphia cheesecake cups. At Berkshire’s annual meeting, Buffett praised 3G’s and Hees’ ability to cut unnecessary costs. “The people at 3G are great, great managers, and they are wonderful partners,” Buffett said. Investors aren’t as convinced they will succeed at Kraft Heinz. Since peaking on Feb. 17, 2017, Kraft Heinz's share price had fallen 40 percent through Tuesday. The S&P; 500 .SPX rose 14 percent in the same period. “We believe the stock market will take care of itself if we deliver upon our commitments,” Hees said. “The stock price today is not in the way of anything we want to achieve in the mid- or long-term.” Rivals’ stock prices have also taken hits. Through Tuesday, the S&P; 500 Packaged Foods & Meats index .SPLRCFOOD had fallen 9.9 percent in the last six months. Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) dropped 7.3 percent, while Campbell Soup Co (CPB.N) and General Mills Inc (GIS.N) lost a respective 12.4 percent and 19 percent. Last week, Kraft Heinz reported better-than-expected first quarter profit, even though organic sales fell 1.5 percent. “We maintain our concern that the management team lacks the marketing acumen necessary to adapt to the dynamic changes in the market and grow its collection of ‘retro’ brands in highly commoditized categories,” Credit Suisse analyst Robert Moskow wrote. Kraft Heinz is trying. Two months ago, Kraft Heinz launched Springboard, a brand incubator to develop natural and organic, specialty and craft, healthy and what it called “experiential” foods. And in April, Kraft Heinz created a viral frenzy when it took to Twitter to gauge whether consumers would buy “Mayochup,” a hybrid of mayonnaise and ketchup. Some called it similar to “fry sauce.” Others noted that many people mix the two already. “We truly believe that our brands need to be relevant, to the product offering, to the position, and to communicate it to consumers, wherever they are,” Hees said. “Pop culture is a great way to do that. Mayochup is a great example. We started, we have these two sauces, can you put them together, is that disgusting, is that good?” With the Kraft Heinz integration “behind us,” Hees said he is investing more into its businesses, armed with knowledge it has gained since the merger. “Things move fast today, that’s a good thing, but we’re a young organization,” he said. “So there are many things we need to learn. Learn from your mistakes. Don’t repeat them. New mistakes are welcome.” ",5092018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kraft-heinz-strategy/kraft-heinz-seeks-buzz-for-big-brands-as-rivals-valuations-come-down-idUSKBN1IA2Y5

The combined company is co-headquartered in Chicago and Pittsburgh. “Big brands have scale, they have profitability, they allow you to grow when you have the right product offerings, and it’s relevant,” said Hees, who previously led Heinz and Burger King. So as Kraft Heinz takes celebrity chef David Chang’s Momofuku Ssam Sauce national, and partners with Food Network on “globally inspired” salad dressings, cooking sauces and meal kits, so too it must inspire consumers to fill their pantries with Planters Signature nuts and Philadelphia cheesecake cups. At Berkshire’s annual meeting, Buffett praised 3G’s and Hees’ ability to cut unnecessary costs. “The people at 3G are great, great managers, and they are wonderful partners,” Buffett said. Investors aren’t as convinced they will succeed at Kraft Heinz. Since peaking on Feb. 17, 2017, Kraft Heinz's share price had fallen 40 percent through Tuesday. The S&P; 500 .SPX rose 14 percent in the same period. “We believe the stock market will take care of itself if we deliver upon our commitments,” Hees said. “The stock price today is not in the way of anything we want to achieve in the mid- or long-term.” Rivals’ stock prices have also taken hits. Through Tuesday, the S&P; 500 Packaged Foods & Meats index .SPLRCFOOD had fallen 9.9 percent in the last six months. Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) dropped 7.3 percent, while Campbell Soup Co (CPB.N) and General Mills Inc (GIS.N) lost a respective 12.4 percent and 19 percent. Last week, Kraft Heinz reported better-than-expected first quarter profit, even though organic sales fell 1.5 percent. “We maintain our concern that the management team lacks the marketing acumen necessary to adapt to the dynamic changes in the market and grow its collection of ‘retro’ brands in highly commoditized categories,” Credit Suisse analyst Robert Moskow wrote. Kraft Heinz is trying. Two months ago, Kraft Heinz launched Springboard, a brand incubator to develop natural and organic, specialty and craft, healthy and what it called “experiential” foods. And in April, Kraft Heinz created a viral frenzy when it took to Twitter to gauge whether consumers would buy “Mayochup,” a hybrid of mayonnaise and ketchup. Some called it similar to “fry sauce.” Others noted that many people mix the two already. “We truly believe that our brands need to be relevant, to the product offering, to the position, and to communicate it to consumers, wherever they are,” Hees said. “Pop culture is a great way to do that. Mayochup is a great example. We started, we have these two sauces, can you put them together, is that disgusting, is that good?” With the Kraft Heinz integration “behind us,” Hees said he is investing more into its businesses, armed with knowledge it has gained since the merger. “Things move fast today, that’s a good thing, but we’re a young organization,” he said. “So there are many things we need to learn. Learn from your mistakes. Don’t repeat them. New mistakes are welcome.” ",5092018,http://www.reuters.com/article/kraft-heinz-strategy/kraft-heinz-seeks-buzz-for-big-brands-as-rivals-valuations-come-down-idUSL1N1SG1D6
