1,DHR,GE expected to report 13 percent rise in profit,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Analysts expect General Electric Co (GE.N) to report a 13 percent rise in net profit on Friday, with strong demand from emerging markets continuing to offset weak U.S. demand and its slimmed-down finance arm.  The largest U.S. conglomerate is experiencing strong demand for a variety of its heavy equipment, from aircraft engines, to gas turbines, to gear used in producing oil and natural gas, company officials have said.  “Business is good,” Chief Executive Office Jeff Immelt told reporters in Greenville, South Carolina, last week. “You have this backdrop of tremendous demand.”  That tremendous demand is largely coming from key emerging markets such as China, Brazil and parts of the Middle East. Demand at home is spottier, particularly for consumer products, due to lingering high U.S. unemployment and low home prices. GE does more than half its business outside the United States.  The gap between strength in the developing world and sluggishness at home has colored earnings reports across the industrial sector this quarter. United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), which generates about 60 percent of its revenue outside the United States, topped analysts’ forecasts this week, while Ingersoll Rand Plc (IR.N), which has a large residential air conditioner business, missed.  Wall Street expects GE to report a net profit of $3.43 billion, earnings per share of 32 cents and $34.7 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The revenue target implies a 7 percent drop, which reflects the company’s continuing drive to scale back its GE Capital finance arm.  One thing that investors will likely not get from GE management is a detailed view of the rest of the year. Unlike its peers, GE does not provide per-share profit forecasts.  That could help GE shares by sparing them the sell-offs that companies, including Danaher Corp (DHR.N), have seen after issuing what analysts described as cautious second-half targets.  “There is just so much macro uncertainty, even if it’s not fully manifesting in companies’ results. I don’t think anyone has too much incentive to be a hero going into the back half,” said Jeffrey Sprague, managing partner at Vertical Research.  Analysts expect GE’s total 2011 profit to rise 18 percent.  The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company's shares have risen about 3 percent so far this year, trailing the 9 percent rise of the Dow Jones Industrial average .DJI.

The company raised its full-year profit forecast to a range of $2.75 to $2.82 per share, up from its prior estimate of $2.65 to $2.75. The average analyst estimate is $2.82.    “The guidance was relatively restrained,” said Jeff Sprague, managing partner with Vertical Research.   “There is some legitimate uncertainty about the momentum in the back half. Companies aren’t sounding like they think the wheels are falling off, but I think they’re in a bit of a defensive posture.”   Danaher shares were down 2.8 percent at $51.60 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. At their lows of the day, they fell to their worst level since December.   In the second quarter, net profit rose to $648.8 million, or 94 cents per share, from $372.5 million or 55 cents per share a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings from continuing operations amounted to 69 cents per share, 2 cents above the average Wall Street estimate.   Revenue rose 16 percent to $3.71 billion, beating the average forecast of $3.52 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Acquisitions and a weaker U.S. dollar together accounted for about half of the sales increase.   Profit margins were little changed at three of Danaher’s five divisions. But they expanded by more than a percentage point in its industrial technologies business and test and measurement segment, whose products include testing equipment for telecommunications networks.   Both also showed the strongest sales increases.   Danaher Chief Executive Larry Culp noted strong geographic differences in the industrial business.   “Emerging markets led the developed markets and the U.S. was ahead of Europe, so it was really the first time we saw that differentiated performance (in the industrial segment),” Culp said on a conference call.   The Washington, D.C.-based maker of medical technology, dental tools and water treatment equipment said it expects to earn 66 to 71 cents per share in the third quarter. Analysts on average have been expecting earnings of 72 cents per share.   Danaher also said it expected margins to improve in its dental business in the third quarter, while its industrial business will again grow faster than the company average, helped in part by demand for product identification technology.

5,DHR,Consumer markets hurt some industrial earnings,"NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Disappointed investors dumped shares of several large U.S. industrial and transport companies after they warned of weak consumer markets, especially in the United States.  3M Co's (MMM.N) earnings met Wall Street forecasts, and the global conglomerate reported strong industrial demand, but also had sharply lower sales in its display and graphics division. Its shares were down 4.8 percent at $90.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, the biggest drag on the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI at midday on Tuesday.  3M’s report was one of several early alarm bells about demand in the second half of 2011, amid persistently high unemployment, a U.S. housing market at multi-year lows, and a political impasse over the debt ceiling.  If U.S. and global economies slow down, cyclical manufacturers may be one of the first sectors where that slowdown will be visible. Near-term profit expectations may come down, said industrials analyst Jeff Windau of Edward Jones.  “Even with some warning signs and potential economic slowing, we still have high expectations,” Windau said. “You see some signs of weakness. The consumer is the most obvious.”  3M said Japan’s March earthquake had reduced sales and profit margins in its display and graphics division, which makes specialty films for computers and televisions. Lower consumer spending was also a factor.  “The LCD TV business is ... going through one of those down cycles that reflect inventory corrections and, ultimately, a less robust consumer end market,” 3M Chief Executive George Buckley told analysts.  Expectations were fairly high for 3M, said Peter Klein, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cleveland. It met estimates because of a weaker dollar and a boost from acquisitions.  “Display and graphics was the weak spot and that’s a consumer item,” Klein said. “That just speaks to the pullback by consumers. It’s not unexpected, but it’s a concern.”  A wider index of U.S. capital goods companies .GSPI was down 1.8 percent. The sour mood affected even companies whose earnings came in ahead of expectations, like Pentair (PNR.N), a maker of filtration and electrical systems whose third-quarter profit outlook disappointed.  Warning signs were not limited to industrial names.  Texas Instruments TXN.N on Monday gave a lukewarm outlook, suggesting back-to-school sales of computers and other electronics would be weaker than normal.  ARM Holdings ARM.L also sounded a note of caution about electronic goods sales this coming Christmas, overshadowing a better-than-expected second quarter.  And Ford Motor (F.N) trimmed its forecast for industry auto sales in North America even as its profit topped expectations on strong pricing.  Shares of United Parcel Service were down 4.7 percent at $70.54 after a modest earnings beat. The world’s largest package delivery company, whose iconic brown trucks carry some 6 percent of the U.S. economy, said it was cautious about its upcoming peak shipping season.  “We have to get unemployment rates down in this country to get consumer confidence up,” CEO Scott Davis said.  Steel and aluminum companies have reported stronger demand from some industrial sectors, but said profits are still constrained by weakness in residential and non-residential construction in Europe and North America.  AK Steel Holding Corp (AKS.N) said it expected a sharp fall in third-quarter operating profit. U.S. Steel (X.N), the biggest U.S. steelmaker, also expects a lower third-quarter profit. Shares of both companies fell.  Though earnings from companies affected by consumer spending hinted at a slowdown, other signs suggested shoppers remain resilient. U.S. stocks pared losses as a better-than-expected reading on consumer confidence boosted investor optimism.  Several other manufacturing names missed profit forecasts.  Illinois Tool Works Inc (ITW.N) missed Wall Street estimates and the industrial conglomerate said it expected moderating demand in the second half of the year, sending its stock down 8.3 percent to $52.28.  Truck maker Paccar (PCAR.O) cited economic uncertainty when it lowered its estimate of this year’s heavy-duty truck production in North America.  Carlisle Cos Inc’s (CSL.N) profit was hurt by raw material costs. Shares of the maker of roofing materials, specialty wheels and food equipment were down 10 percent at $43.76.  Lennox International (LII.N), which makes furnaces and air conditioners, cut its outlook. Earnings missed forecasts by a wide margin, and shares fell 8.6 percent to $37.66.  A bright spot in U.S. industrial earnings was Cummins Inc (CMI.N), which credited strong international markets for its profit growth. The diesel engine maker said demand from truck, mining and energy markets remained strong and raised its earnings forecast.

7,DHR,Consumer markets hurt some industrial earnings,"NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Disappointed investors dumped shares of several large U.S. industrial and transport companies after they warned of weak consumer markets, especially in the United States.  3M Co's (MMM.N) earnings met Wall Street forecasts, and the global conglomerate reported strong industrial demand, but sharply lower sales in its display and graphics division. Its shares fell more than 4 percent on Tuesday, dragging down the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI.  3M said Japan’s March earthquake had reduced sales and profit margins in the display and graphics division, which makes specialty films for computers and televisions.  “If everybody else is beating and you’re not, you lose,” said analyst Brian Langenberg of Langenberg & Co. “It’s a relative beauty contest.”  Industrial peers W.W. Grainger (GWW.N), United Technologies (UTX.N), General Electric (GE.N), and Danaher (DHR.N) beat expectations this quarter, Langenberg said, while 3M’s display and graphics business missed on both sales and profits, in part because of production disruptions in Japan.  3M Chief Executive Officer George Buckley tied weakness in that segment to lower consumer spending.  “The LCD TV business is ... simply going through one of those down cycles that reflect inventory corrections and, ultimately, a less robust consumer end market,” Buckley said on a conference call.  Expectations were pretty high for 3M, said Peter Klein, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cleveland.  3M met Wall Street earnings estimates partly because of a weaker dollar and a boost from acquisitions “so maybe the quality of that wasn’t as high as people may have wanted to see,” Klein said.  “Display and graphics was the weak spot and that’s a consumer item,” Klein said. “That just speaks to the pullback by consumers. It’s not unexpected, but it’s a concern.”  Increases in raw material costs also pinched margins, as 3M could not recoup them through price increases.  Shares of United Parcel Service fell 5 percent after a modest earnings beat. The world’s largest package delivery company, whose results are a closely watched indicator of consumer demand, said it was cautious about its upcoming peak shipping season.  Illinois Tool Works Inc’s (ITW.N) quarterly profit missed Wall Street forecasts, and the industrial conglomerate said it expected moderating demand in the second half of the year, sending its stock down more than 7 percent.  Among other results on Tuesday, truck maker Paccar (PCAR.O) cited economic uncertainty when it lowered its estimate of this year’s heavy-duty truck production in North America.

Grainger (GWW.N), United Technologies (UTX.N), General Electric (GE.N), and Danaher (DHR.N) beat expectations this quarter, Langenberg said, while 3M’s display and graphics business missed on both sales and profits, hurt in part by production disruptions in Japan.   Net earnings rose to $1.16 billion, or $1.60 per share, in the second quarter from $1.12 billion, or $1.54 per share, a year earlier.   While earnings only met analyst expectations, 3M’s sales growth exceeded them. Sales rose 14 percent to a record $7.68 billion, above Wall Street forecasts of $7.60 billion.   The weaker U.S. dollar helped boost revenue, while a lower-than-expected tax rate supported earnings, several analysts noted.   The industrial and transportation segments showed the strongest sales growth, up 18 percent, while sales of consumer and office goods rose 4 percent. The only sales decline was in 3M’s display and graphics segment, down 11 percent, partly reflecting lower production of liquid crystal displays.   “A larger-than-anticipated contraction in LCD TV end-market demand affected our sales, reflecting a tighter consumer electronics market,” 3M Chief Executive Officer George Buckley said.   Shares of 3M, part of the Dow Jones industrial average, were down 3.3 percent at $91.95 shortly before the market opened. The stock has outperformed its industrial peers since early June.   3M, which has greater exposure to Japan than most of its peers, said the March earthquake, which shut production of autos and consumer electronics, reduced quarterly earnings by 7 cents a share and hurt operating margins by half a percentage point. It expects the disaster to lower earnings in the back half the year by up to 5 cents a share.   Still, 3M raised the lower end of its 2011 profit forecast by 5 cents a share to a range of $6.32 to $6.47, excluding pension and other costs.   Because many of 3M’s products are low-cost, quickly used and sold all over the world, the company is a barometer of global industrial health amid a European debt crisis, China’s efforts to tame inflation, and stagnant economic growth in the United States.   Growth in Europe was actually the strongest in the quarter, followed by Latin America and Canada, Asia-Pacific, all up at double-digit percentage rates. U.S. sales grew a more modest 8.7 percent.   3M gets more than 30 percent of its sales from fast-growing emerging markets.  (Reporting by Nick Zieminski, editing by Gerald E.

9,DHR,UPDATE 4-PerkinElmer to buy Caliper for $600 mln," * To pay $10.50 per share for Caliper Life Sciences   * To cut PerkinElmer 2012 net EPS by 5 cents per share   * Could add as much as 20 cents per share to 2013 earnings   * Deal, approved by both boards, seen closing in 4th qtr   * Caliper shares jump 41 percent, PerkinElmer down 2.9 pct  (Updates share prices, adds Caliper revenue)   By Bill Berkrot   NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - PerkinElmer Inc (PKI.N) agreed to buy Caliper Life Sciences Inc CALP.O for $600 million to broaden its product offerings in molecular imaging and genomic detection technologies.   The deal marks the biggest acquisition for PerkinElmer under Robert Friel, who became its chief executive in 2008.   PerkinElmer, which sells scientific instruments, environmental safety monitoring products and medical testing equipment, said on Thursday it would pay $10.50 per share for Caliper, which represents a 42 percent premium over its Wednesday closing share price of $7.39 on Wednesday.   Caliper shares jumped 41 percent to $10.39 on Nasdaq, while PerkinElmer shares were down nearly 3 percent at $21.40 on the New York Stock Exchange..   “The most attractive part of Caliper is the terrific technology and intellectual property that they bring,” Friel said in a telephone interview.   The acquisition “allows us to take their products through our distribution to markets outside the U.S. and Europe,” said Friel, who has his sights on Asia and other emerging markets for Caliper offerings.   The deal, which has been approved by both boards and is expected to close in the fourth quarter, will cut about 5 cents per share from PerkinElmer’s 2012 net earnings, the company said. It could add about 8 cents per share to adjusted 2012 earnings, excluding special items.   The acquisition could add as much as 20 cents a share to PerkinElmer earnings in 2013, Friel said.   Caliper had 2010 sales of about $124 million and forecast 2011 revenue would increase between 12 percent and 20 percent.   Caliper products include DNA sequencing equipment, reagents and microfluids used for gene and protein detection, preclinical imaging instruments and automated laboratory equipment.   “It is highly complementary to the logistics of their current portfolio,” said Mizuho Securities analyst Peter Lawson. “It fits in very neatly with lots of recent acquisitions that PerkinElmer made.”   Cash on hand will be used to pay for about a third of the deal, with the rest to be financed through a public bond offering, Friel said.   Kevin Hrusovsky, chief executive of Hopkinton, Massachusetts-based Caliper, is expected to join PerkinElmer’s senior management team following the close of the deal.   PerkinElmer, which is based outside Boston, has been acquisitive in recent years, typically making several deals a year in the $50 million to $100 million range.   In its more recent acquisition, PerkinElmer in June bought London-based Dexela Ltd, a maker of X-ray detection technologies, for about $30 million.   Published reports in February had PerkinElmer close to acquiring Beckman Coulter in what would have been by far its biggest deal, but PerkinElmer never confirmed that it was in the bidding for the medical diagnostics company. Danaher Corp (DHR.N) bought Beckman for $5.8 billion — nearly three times PerkinElmer’s annual revenue.   PerkinElmer shares are off more than 14 percent year to date, with most of the decline coming over the past two months.

10,DHR,UPDATE 1-Danaher backs outlook despite volatility," NEW YORK, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Industrial and medical conglomerate Danaher Corp (DHR.N) said recent volatility in financial markets and uncertainty about economic growth have not changed its earnings outlook for the current quarter and the rest of the year.   The company, whose products range from dental tools to test and measurement equipment and machines used at gas stations, stood by its forecast for earnings per share from continuing operations of 66 cents to 71 cents in the third quarter.   “I think we feel very good with that guidance today,” Chief Executive Larry Culp said at the outset of an analyst meeting Friday focused on the company’s growth in emerging markets. “July and August played out to expectations. We are seeing some, but I think very modest, impact from the headlines.”   Danaher’s businesses in emerging markets are growing faster than in developed markets, and the United States is stronger than Europe, Culp said.   The Washington-based company forecast China sales, including exports from China, of $1.7 billion this year, India sales of $250 million, and Latin America sales of $600 million.   Separately, Danaher said it had begun the process of cutting about 1,000 jobs as a result of its takeover of Beckman Coulter, a maker of medical diagnostics technology. That $5.8 billion deal was Danaher’s biggest ever.

11,DHR,BUY OR SELL-U.S. industrial shares show profit pessimism," * Industrial stocks have lagged broader market   * Companies may soon start lowering outlooks   * Executives, some analysts still see strong growth   By Nick Zieminski   Sept 14 (Reuters) - U.S. industrial stocks are flashing yellow, having lost a fifth of their value in the last two months in what some describe as a warning that another recession is looming.   The market is suggesting U.S. manufacturing multinationals may be poised to cut earnings estimates or ratchet down expectations for next year, as slowing economies and uncertainty over any resolution of Europe’s debt problems raise more questions about demand for high-value capital goods.   The Standard & Poor's Capital Goods index .GSPIC has fallen more than 20 percent since mid-July, when General Electric Co (GE.N), Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), 3M Co (MMM.N) and other big manufacturers began reporting second-quarter results. That is a steeper decline than the broad S&P 500 index's .SPX 13 percent slide.   Even as the shares have sunk, management of top U.S. manufacturers and the Wall Street analysts that follow them have largely stood by profit targets that call for double-digit-percentage growth in the second half of the year.   Industrial distributor W.W. Grainger (GWW.N) said on Monday that August sales rose at the same pace as in July. Danaher Corp’s (DHR.N) chief executive officer said last week that he felt “very good” about the conglomerate’s third-quarter forecast.   This month will determine who is right — bullish managers or skittish investors — since September accounts for up to 45 percent of third-quarter sales. The companies will begin reporting their results in October.   Nomura analyst Shannon O’Callaghan cut 2012 earnings estimates for a dozen manufacturing giants, including GE, Danaher, 3M and Tyco International TYC.N, to an average of 9 percent below consensus.   For some companies, such as Ingersoll Rand (IR.N) and SPX Corp SPW.N, his estimates are 17 percent below the Wall Street average. O’Callaghan also lowered the companies’ share-price targets. [ID:nWNAB5908]   His reasoning? Profit warnings are coming.   “Further slowing has yet to manifest itself via guidance cuts ... but will likely do so in coming months,” O’Callaghan said in a note to clients, adding price-to-earnings ratios have come down in anticipation of such cuts.   O’Callaghan said the stocks could do well if recession risks erode, but “that is still a big ‘if’ right now.”   Headwinds to 2012 forecasts include the European debt crisis; political gridlock in Washington; and the possibility that China’s efforts to curb inflation could slow its economy too much.   Stocks are pricing in not just a slowdown but an actual decline in earnings. Cooper Industries CBE.N, Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), Dover Corp (DOV.N) and Eaton Corp (ETN.N) are trading at 10 or less times next year’s estimated earnings, only slightly above their multiples in the last recession.   Only financial stocks have fallen more steeply so far this year. Industrials were the second-best-performing sector in 2010 as the global recovery gained speed, but that recovery is increasingly in doubt, according to Standard & Poor’s.   Bulls point to healthy demand from markets like utilities and commercial aerospace. Home prices are stabilizing, and credit remains accessible to large companies. Some late-cycle markets, such as nonresidential construction, have yet to recover, but are unlikely to fall much further.   Some economists expect U.S. economic growth to accelerate next year. An index of U.S. factory activity in August came in above estimates and remains at a level that indicates expansion.   Still, electrical and multi-industry stocks trade at a discount to the S&P 500 index based on expected 2012 profits for the first time since the 2008-2009 recession: evidence that investors have lost confidence in Wall Street estimates.   “It’s goblins in people’s heads right now,” said analyst Nick Heymann of William Blair & Co. “The fear factor is casting a far, far bigger shadow on valuations than the fundamentals.”   Most companies are likely to meet forecasts when they report third-quarter results, said Vertical Research Partners analyst Jeff Sprague. But they may start to talk down expectations about the fourth quarter and beyond while giving 2012 forecasts that are below Wall Street expectations.   “It feels like we’ve discounted a full-fledged recession, and the odds are that we might have some kind muddle-through, slow growth,” Sprague said. “There could be a pretty significant bounce-back if it turns out September was OK.”  (Reporting by Nick Zieminski in New York; Additional reporting by Scott Malone in Boston; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)   ",9142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-manufacturing-outlook/buy-or-sell-u-s-industrial-shares-show-profit-pessimism-idUSS1E78C0GC20110914

Net earnings were $523.4 million, or 74 cents per share, compared with $646.4 million, or 95 cents a share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations came to 73 cents a share, beating average analyst estimates by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue jumped 46 percent to $4.52 billion, mainly reflecting acquisitions, ahead of Wall Street forecasts of $4.46 billion. The Washington-based maker of medical technology, dental tools and water treatment equipment did not immediately update its full-year profit forecast, but said the environment was likely to be more challenging. The company typically gives its profit outlook on its conference call before the start of trading. Danaher has been both an active buyer and seller of businesses as it focuses its portfolio on higher-margin, faster-growing areas including life sciences, dental and medical technology. It paid $5.8 billion for medical diagnostics company Beckman Coulter in its biggest-ever deal.",10202011,http://www.reuters.com/article/danaher/update-2-danaher-profit-beats-wall-street-estimates-idUSN1E79I14820111020
15,DHR,L-3 to buy Danaher's defense unit for $210 million,"(Reuters) - L-3 Communications (LLL.N) said it would buy Danaher Corp’s (DHR.N) defense unit for $210 million in cash, to expand its surveillance and image sensing product offerings, a key growth area for the defense contractor. The unit, Kollmorgen Electro-Optical (KEO), makes periscopes for submarines, optical communication systems, ship fire control systems, and visual landing aids. It has facilities in Italy, in addition to the ones in the U.S., and employs 550 people. With the Obama administration planning to cut troops in Afghanistan by a third by 2012, and exit from Iraq by the end of this year, the U.S. is expected to rely more on intelligence gathering, surveillance and reconnaissance technology for military operations. KEO is expected to generate sales of about $160-$170 and million in 2012. The company will become part Of L-3’s Electronic Systems segment - which offers products that use electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) and electronic warfare sensors. Last year, L-3’s Chief Executive Michael Strianese said he expected continued demand for unmanned planes and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities to drive sales of products with sophisticated electro-optical infrared (EO/IR) sensors. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2012 and add to earnings immediately after close, L-3 said in a statement. Shares of L-3 were up 2 percent at $66.51 on Monday morning on the New York Stock Exchange, while Danaher’s stock was up 1 percent at $46.19.

21,DHR,Danaher profit tops Street expectations,"(Reuters) - Danaher Corp (DHR.N) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by higher margins at its dental and test and measurement businesses, and the industrial and medical technology conglomerate raised its full-year profit forecast. Danaher’s key China market, where sales were flat in the quarter, was now showing signs of rebounding as orders outpaced shipments, Chief Executive Larry Culp said. “As we go through the year, China should get better,” Culp said on the company’s conference call, adding he expected mid-to-high single digit sales growth in China in the second quarter. Danaher is among the first multinational industrial companies to comment about the China market this earnings season. In recent years, growth in that market has been one of the bright spots for manufacturers, but many have pointed to a slowdown in recent quarters. Danaher’s net earnings rose to $612.9 million, or 86 cents per share, compared with $429.4 million, or 63 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations were 73 cents a share, beating the analysts’ average estimate by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 31 percent to $4.32 billion, largely reflecting acquisitions. Sales in North America and in emerging markets improved, despite flat China sales, but were lower in Europe. Washington-based Danaher completed its $5.8 billion purchase of medical diagnostics company Beckman Coulter in June, doubling the size of its life sciences and diagnostics division and pitting it against giants 3M Co (MMM.N) and General Electric Co (GE.N). But margins in the life sciences business were lower due to deal costs. This month, Danaher said it would pay $478.9 million before assumed debt for X-Rite XRIT.O, a provider of digital color management technology that competes with Japan’s Konica-Minolta (4902.T). The deal environment is attractive, CEO Culp said, and the company has about $5 billion in acquisitions capacity over the next two years. Danaher slightly raised its full-year profit forecast even as its second-quarter outlook came in below Wall Street estimates. The company said it expected full-year earnings of $3.25 to $3.35 a share from continuing operations, compared with analysts’ estimates of $3.30. For the second quarter, Danaher forecast earnings of 76 cents to 81 cents a share, while Wall Street was expecting 82 cents. Danaher shares were down slightly at $54.50 in premarket trading.

24,DHR,UPDATE 1-Danaher CFO: Euro weakness could reduce earnings,"* Euro weakness, if it continues, would reduce FY EPS by 5 cts * Danaher seeing ‘pockets of weakness’-CFO * Shares up 0.9 percent By Nick Zieminski NEW YORK, June 6 (Reuters) - The recent weakness of the euro against the U.S. dollar could push down Danaher Corp’s  full-year earnings if it persists, the company’s finance chief said on Wednesday. When the medical and industrial conglomerate reported quarterly results in late April, one euro bought around $1.30. The currency has since fallen to $1.24. If that euro weakness continues, it would reduce Danaher’s full-year earnings by about 5 cents a share, Chief Financial Officer Daniel Komas told a JPMorgan investor conference in New York. Analysts on average expect Danaher to earn $3.32 per share for the year. The company generates nearly a quarter of its sales from Western Europe. A weaker euro reduces the value of European sales when they are translated into dollars. The euro hit a two-year low against the dollar last week on fears that a European debt crisis may force Greece to exit the euro zone and that Spain may need to issue more debt to recapitalize its banks. Komas said Danaher’s industrial businesses, such as test and measurement equipment, were one area of weakness in Europe, along with its life sciences business, which relies in part on government research budgets. However, demand for medical diagnostic equipment remains “pretty good” in Europe, he said. Asked whether the current economic weakness felt like 2008, at the outset of recession, Komas said it did not. “If you go back to the fall of ‘08, even the late summer, pre the Lehman bankruptcy, you saw a noticeable delta between orders and shipments,” he said. “It was a real sign things are going to turn south. We’re not seeing that. We’re seeing pockets of weakness.” For Danaher, which has long relied on mergers and acquisitions to fuel growth, weak markets have a silver lining because they reduce asset prices. “Every dynamic presents an opportunity,” Komas said. Shares of Danaher were up 0.9 percent at $50.80 in early trading.",6062012,http://www.reuters.com/article/danaher-euro-cfo/update-1-danaher-cfo-euro-weakness-could-reduce-earnings-idUSL1E8H63RH20120606

It also warned that a stronger dollar would trim profits. Although U.S. markets were strong in the second quarter, the company is “on alert” because it sees “hairline fractures” in its life sciences and test-and-measurement businesses, Chief Executive Larry Culp said. He said the decision to boost spending on restructuring might prove conservative but seems right at the present time. “We’re seeing customers hesitate to write (orders),” Culp said on a conference call. “In other cases, projects are being pushed out a little more than we would have anticipated.” He said an expected rebound in sales in China may not come as soon as had been expected, but other emerging markets remain strong. Danaher shares were down 1.9 percent in premarket trading. Second-quarter net income fell to $600.1 million, or 84 cents per share, from $648.8 million, or 94 cents per share, a year earlier, when discontinued operations contributed to profits.

29,DHR,"Danaher lowers outlook on strong dollar, restructuring","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Industrial and medical conglomerate Danaher Corp (DHR.N) reported lower quarterly earnings on Thursday, cut its full-year forecast and said it would speed up cost cuts to protect profit margins in a worsening economic environment. The company said it would spend $100 million this year to restructure operations and warned that a stronger dollar would trim profits. Net income fell to $600.1 million, or 84 cents per share, from $648.8 million, or 94 cents per share, a year earlier, when discontinued operations contributed to profits. It was not immediately clear whether the figure, which included a tax benefit and other items, was directly comparable with the 81 cents a share that analysts expected. Sales rose 25 percent to $4.6 billion, with acquisitions accounting for the bulk of the growth. Danaher completed its $5.8 billion purchase of U.S. medical diagnostics company Beckman Coulter last year. Washington-based Danaher, which derives about a quarter of its sales and profits from Europe, said it expected a full-year profit of $3.19 to $3.26 a share.

41,DHR,TEXT-S&P; summary: Danaher Corp.,"For 2013, we expect the company to continue to experience moderating demand in its industrial and medical markets, with some ongoing and likely protracted weakness in its more cyclical businesses amid a slowdown in China and weak European demand. We believe this would be offset by stability from a large recurring revenue base, margin expansion opportunities in acquired businesses (including the large Beckman Coulter acquisition completed in 2011), and growth initiatives. We view the company’s financial risk profile as modest. This takes into account its very active acquisition strategy, including the use of debt financing, which the company moderates with the occasional use of equity issuance for large transactions, and with consistent, steadily growing FOCF. FOCF provides ample capacity for Danaher to reduce debt or fund external growth. In addition, Danaher’s dividends and share repurchases have historically been very modest, leading to very high discretionary cash flow conversion. We fully expect the company to continue to rely on debt-financed acquisitions to achieve its long-term growth objectives. Credit metrics are currently satisfactory for the rating, with leverage of about 1.5x, funds from operations (FFO) to total debt of over 50%, and FOCF to total debt of about 45%. Liquidity Our short-term rating is ‘A-1’. We view Danaher’s liquidity as “strong,” reflecting our expectation that its liquidity sources can more than cover its needs for the foreseeable future, even if EBITDA were to unexpectedly decline by 30%. Our liquidity assessment is based on the following factors and assumptions: — We expect the company’s liquidity sources, including FFO and credit facility availability, to exceed uses by more than 1.5x over the next 12 to 24 months. — The company’s debt maturities over the next two years are manageable in our view, consisting of $300 million and EUR500 million notes due 2013. — Even if EBITDA declines by 30%, we believe net sources would exceed cash requirements. — The company has good relationships with its banks, in our assessment, and a good standing in the credit markets. In our analysis, we estimate liquidity sources will exceed $5 billion over the next 12 months. We believe sources will consist of discretionary cash flow of about $3 billion and about $2.5 billion available under a credit facility that expires in 2016. Proceeds from the sale of the Apex Tools joint venture we expect in 2013 should provide additional funds. Liquidity uses primarily consist of debt maturities: these include about $537 million of commercial paper borrowings, and $1 billion of notes due in fiscal 2013, and $400 million notes in 2014. Outlook The outlook is stable. We fully expect the company to continue to rely on debt-financed acquisitions to achieve its long-term growth objectives, but its growing and consistent free cash flow and restrained shareholder distribution policies should continue to support the rating. With credit metrics currently adequate for the rating and our expectation for steady operating performance, annual free cash flow of $2.5 billion provide for at least $5 billion in acquisition capacity over the next two years. We could lower the ratings if subdued growth in Danaher’s key markets, difficulties integrating acquisitions, or severe cost inflation pressure the company’s operating profits and cause annual FOCF to weaken below $2 billion, as this would likely impair credit ratios below our expectations. We could also lower the ratings if a larger-than-expected debt-financed acquisition cause FOCF to total debt to weaken below 35% for more than two years. We could raise the rating if the company commits to a less acquisitive growth strategy, while at the same time maintaining disciplined shareholder distribution objectives, and if the outlook for its overall business portfolio points to continued solid operating performance.

The Danaher-Blackstone consortium is competing against several private equity bidders for J&J;’s Ortho Clinical Diagnostics unit, including Bain Capital LLC; Carlyle Group LP (CG.O); BC Partners Ltd; and a partnership of CVC Capital Partners Ltd and Leonard Green & Partners LP, the people said. J&J;, which received preliminary offers for the division in late September, is seeking a new, interim round of bids by November 11, the people said on Thursday, asking not to be named because the matter is confidential. Blackstone, BC Partners, Carlyle and CVC declined to comment. Representatives for J&J;, Danaher, Bain and Leonard Green did not immediately respond to requests for comment. J&J; had initially hoped to fetch as much as $5 billion from selling the diagnostics unit, but potential buyers are now valuing the business closer to $4 billion, some of the people said. Danaher and Blackstone are joining forces after squaring off in the auction of another large medical technology company more than two years ago. Danaher acquired medical diagnostics company Beckman Coulter Inc for $5.8 billion in 2011, outbidding a consortium of Blackstone and TPG Capital LP, and substantially expanding its life sciences and diagnostics business. There are significant synergies between Danaher and the J&J; unit that could give the consortium an edge over other bidders, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. The J&J; unit for sale, which has tests that are considered older and less profitable than modern molecular diagnostics, has annual sales of about $2 billion. It makes tests that can reveal a patient’s blood type and screen for viruses like HIV and hepatitis C. It is a small player in a market led by larger rivals such as Roche Holding AG ROG.VX, Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE), Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) and Danaher. J&J; said in January it would explore strategic alternatives for the unit and cautioned that the process could take anywhere from about 12 months to 24 months. It asked JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to run the sale of the unit, Reuters previously reported. J&J;’s decision to divest the division comes as drugmakers are shedding businesses and cutting costs in response to overseas price controls and pressure on payments from insurers and the government. Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), for instance, just spun off its animal health products business, and Abbott split off its branded drugs unit early this year.

50,DHR,J&J; chooses two bidders for diagnostics sale negotiations: sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Carlyle Group LP (CG.O) and a consortium of Danaher Corp (DHR.N) and Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) have advanced to the final stage of negotiations for Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) diagnostics unit, according to people familiar with the matter. These two bidders appear willing to pay the most for the unit, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, though a deal may now value it at up to $4 billion, less than the $5 billion J&J; was initially hoping for, the people said on Thursday. Other private equity firms, including Bain Capital LLC, BC Partners Ltd and a consortium of CVC Capital Partners Ltd and Leonard Green & Partners LP, considered the valuation too high given the unit’s lack of growth and are no longer in talks with J&J;, the people added. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the sale process is confidential. J&J; and Danaher did not respond to requests for comment. Carlyle, Blackstone, Bain, BC Partners, CVC and Leonard Green declined to comment. The diagnostics unit makes blood screening equipment and laboratory blood tests that are considered older and less profitable than modern molecular diagnostics. It also makes tests that can reveal a patient’s blood type and screen for viruses such as HIV and hepatitis C. It is a small player in a market led by larger rivals such as Roche Holding AG ROG.VX, Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE), Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) and Danaher. J&J; said in January it would explore strategic alternatives for the unit and cautioned that the process could take anywhere from 12 months to 24 months. It asked JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to run the sale of the unit, Reuters previously reported. J&J;’s decision to divest the division comes as drugmakers are shedding businesses and cutting costs in response to overseas price controls and pressure on payments from insurers and the government. Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), for instance, recently spun off its animal health products business, and Abbott split off its branded drugs unit early this year.

53,DHR,"Exclusive: Danaher, Blackstone in joint bid for Ashland water unit - sources","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Industrial conglomerate Danaher Corp (DHR.N) and private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) are pursuing a joint bid for chemicals manufacturer Ashland Inc’s (ASH.N) water technologies unit, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, in a deal that could top $1.5 billion. It is the second asset that Danaher is pursuing in partnership with Blackstone following their participation in an auction, currently underway, for Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) clinical diagnostics unit that could fetch $4 billion. The partnership could offer Blackstone an edge in what is shaping up to be a popular auction with private equity firms. Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N); Bain Capital LLC; TPG Capital LP; Onex Corp OCX.TO; Advent International Corp; Rhone Group LLC; Clayton, Dubilier & Rice LLC and Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s (GS.N) private equity arm are among the firms that are also through to the second round of bidding for Ashland’s water technologies unit, other people familiar with the matter said this week. The water technologies business has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of roughly $200 million and could fetch eight times that amount, the people said. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because details of the auction are confidential. An Ashland spokesman declined to comment while representatives of the private equity firms either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. Ashland’s water treatment business, the third largest among the company’s four units, supplies chemicals to industries including pulp, paper and mining. The business also makes products such as biocides, coagulants and wood adhesives. Under pressure from activist investor Jana Partners LLC, Ashland said in July it had asked Citigroup Inc (C.N) to help review options for the water technologies unit. Earlier this month, Ashland said that a sale process was underway and expected to wrap up in the first quarter of 2014. Ashland added that it expected to use proceeds from the sale primarily to fund share buybacks. The company appointed John Panichella, a senior vice president at Ashland and who has more than 25 years of experience in global water markets, to lead the water technologies business in October. Ashland and other large U.S. chemical companies, including DuPont DD.N and Dow Chemical Co DOW.N, are looking to sell their non-core, cyclical assets and focus on businesses that generate higher margins even during downturns. Such corporate carve-outs have proved to be a major source of dealmaking for buyout firms active in the industrial sector. In February, for example, Carlyle Group LP (CG.O) acquired DuPont’s performance coatings business for $4.9 billion while Cinven Ltd bought Rockwood Holdings Inc’s ROC.N ceramics business in September for $2 billion. Ashland has also initiated the sale of its rubber business, which primarily serves the North American replacement tire market.

65,DHR,Danaher to buy Nobel Biocare for $2.2 billion,"ZURICH (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare group Danaher Corp (DHR.N) is to buy Nobel Biocare Holding AG NOBN.S for an agreed $2.2 billion to become the world’s biggest player in a dental implants market benefiting from growing demand for cosmetic dentistry. Danaher said on Monday it would pay 17.10 Swiss francs per Nobel Biocare share in cash, about 23 percent above Nobel Biocare’s closing price on July 28, the day before the Swiss firm said it was in talks with potential buyers.  However, Nobel Biocare shares fell as much as 6 percent after analysts had predicted the company could fetch over 20 francs per share. “From my side, it doesn’t fill me with that much enthusiasm. But I don’t expect there will be a second bid,” Sebastien Buch, a portfolio manager at Union Investment which owns roughly 3 percent of Nobel Biocare’s shares, told Reuters.  Danaher is a leading provider of dental equipment, but only a small player in the fragmented dental implants market after its acquisition of low-cost manufacturer Implant Direct. The purchase of Nobel Biocare, the world’s No.2 dental implants maker, will bring Danaher a premium range of implants and boost its dental business to sales of around $3 billion. Vontobel analysts forecast the global dental implants market is set to double to $6 billion by 2025, helped by recovering Western economies and rising incomes in developing countries. Danaher President and Chief Executive Thomas P. Joyce told a conference call that Nobel Biocare’s recent investment in high-growth markets such as China, eastern Europe and Latin America - which now make up about 20 percent of sales - had made it an attractive opportunity. Fellow dental implant players such as Henry Schein (HSIC.O) and Dentsply (XRAY.O) had been cited as possible bidders for Nobel Biocare, while the company had reportedly also attracted interest from buyout group EQT Partners. Analysts at Berenberg said it was “by no means a certainty” that Nobel Biocare’s shareholders would agree to tender their shares at Danaher’s price, adding it was possible that other potential suitors could enter the fray with a higher offer. The deal, recommended by Nobel Biocare’s board, requires the acceptance of 67 percent of Nobel Biocare’s shareholders. But other analysts said the price was fair and counter bids looked unlikely. Swiss rival Straumann (STMN.S) ruled out interest in Nobel Biocare last month, while Zimmer ZMH.N is busy with its purchase of Biomet Inc for more than $13 billion.  “Nobel has run an extensive sales process and we believe that Nobel is less attractive for private equity in light of its weak cash flow and no synergy opportunities,” said Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Ed Ridley-Day. Joyce said Danaher expected the deal to help it deliver a 10 percent return on invested capital (ROIC) by 2019. It expects the deal to add five cents to earnings per share by 2015 and ten cents by 2016. The Nobel Biocare deal follows on from a wave of mergers among medical supplies makers this year, including Medtronic Inc’s (MDT.N) $42.9 billion deal to buy Dublin-based Covidien Plc COV.N in June.  Like other makers of premium implants, Nobel Biocare has struggled since the financial crisis as cash-strapped consumers, particularly in southern Europe, cut back on pricey dental work which is not generally reimbursed by insurers. Nobel Biocare’s stock is down 80 percent since its all-time high in 2007. The company grappled with years of sliding sales and dwindling market share as it faced competition from a growing number of so-called “value” players. But signs have grown that a long-awaited turnaround is taking root and the company has notched up five consecutive quarters of revenue growth at constant exchange rates. Although the premium market is growing at a slower pace than the value segment, Danaher said it still expects dentists to prefer premium implants for complex cases. It expects the premium segment to keep growing in the 3-5 percent range. Nobel Biocare had sales of 567 million euros ($735 million) and net profit of 42.6 million euros in 2013. It has $556 million of bonds and loans. Danaher said Nobel Biocare would continue to operate as a standalone company and maintain its own brand and identity.  The deal is expected to be completed in late 2014 or early 2015. Nobel Biocare was advised by Goldman Sachs, while Credit Suisse acted as financial adviser and offer manager to Danaher.

71,DHR,Danaher to combine communications unit with NetScout,"(Reuters) - U.S. healthcare technology group Danaher Corp is combining its communications unit with NetScout Systems Inc, scaling up the business at a time when companies are spending aggressively on cybersecurity. Danaher shareholders will get NetScout shares worth $2.6 billion, giving them majority stake in the company, while NetScout will have operational control. Danaher’s communications business sells cybersecurity products and tools to manage networks, while NetScout makes products that monitor software applications on networks. Danaher’s technology will help jump start NetScout’s cyber security efforts, NetScout CEO Anil Singhal said, noting that the deal comes after five years of talks with Danaher. Cybersecurity has become a hot area in the face of increasingly sophisticated attacks and companies are spending more on internet security to prevent breaches. “(Danaher’s communications) business needed a broader set of growth drivers as well as scale, and NetScout made for an excellent partner,” ISI Group analyst Ross Muken wrote in an email. The combination is structured as a Reverse Morris Trust transaction, which allows a company to sell a unit in a tax-efficient manner by merging it with a smaller company. Danaher will create a wholly owned subsidiary to hold its communications business and will distribute ownership of the business to its shareholders. Under the deal, NetScout will issue 62.5 million new shares to Danaher’s shareholders, giving them a stake of 59.5 percent in the combined company. The rest will be owned by NetScout shareholders. “Danaher’s shareholders don’t have much beyond voting capability.

78,DHR,"Danaher to buy Pall Corp in $13.8 billion deal, split into two","(Reuters) - Danaher Corp (DHR.N) will buy air and water-filter maker Pall Corp PLL.N in a $13.8 billion deal to tap into fast-growing demand from the biotechnology industry, and said it would split into two listed companies after the deal. The $20-billion filtration market is expected to grow due to strong demand for advanced purification systems as biotechnology companies launch more biologics, drugs made from living cells. “Biologic drugs will go from about 20-25 percent of the market to 50 percent in the next few years,” said Ross Muken, an Evercore ISI analyst. “That means an increase in production and more demand for filtration products and services.” Danaher and Pall Corp shares each rose as much as 5 percent to touch record highs of $90 and $124.61, respectively, on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Danaher’s offer of $127.20 per share represents a premium of 28 percent to Pall Corp’s close on Monday. Danaher, which has a market value of about $60 billion, is an aggressive deal-maker, striking at least four deals since September when veteran company executive Thomas Joyce Jr took over as chief executive. Just two weeks after Joyce’s appointment, Danaher said it would buy Switzerland’s Nobel Biocare to become the biggest player in the dental implants market. “An acquisition of Pall has been the ‘next Danaher deal’ for the last decade,” Nigel Coe, an analyst with Morgan Stanley wrote in a note on Tuesday, a day after the Wall Street Journal reported Pall Corp was for sale. “The core filtration business is a logical complement to DHR’s life sciences and environmental franchises.” Danaher said it would split into a science and technology company and an industrial company through a tax-free separation. The company retaining the Danaher name will comprise Pall Corp as well as Danaher’s life sciences and diagnostics, dental, water quality and product identification businesses. The other will make test and measurement products, retail fuel pumps, and telematics and automation products. Joyce will remain CEO of the new Danaher. James Lico, who leads Danaher’s retail fuel and test and measurement businesses, will lead the other company. Danaher said it expects to complete the deal by the end of the year and the split by the end of 2016. The company said it would finance the deal mainly with available cash and new debt. Goldman Sachs & Co served as Pall Corp’s financial adviser, while Shearman & Sterling LLP served as legal adviser.

92,DHR,Danaher to buy Cepheid in $4 billion deal to expand in diagnostics,"(Reuters) - Danaher Corp said on Tuesday it would buy medical diagnostics company Cepheid in a deal valued at $4 billion, including debt, that will strengthen its presence in  molecular diagnostics. Danaher, which develops technology for the dental, life sciences, diagnostics and environmental industries, spun off its industrial division in July to focus on science and technology. Piper Jaffray analysts said the transaction made strategic sense since Danaher had a large diagnostics business but lacked a strong molecular presence, where Cepheid a market leader.

Danaher, which develops technology for the dental, life sciences, diagnostics and environmental industries, spun off its industrial division in July to focus on science and technology.

103,DHR,UPDATE 1-Siemens to pick banks for blockbuster Healthineers listing - sources,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German industrial group Siemens (SIEGn.DE) will shortly start picking banks to organize a stock market listing of its healthcare business, which could be valued at up to 37 billion euros ($40 billion) including debt, three people close to the matter said.  Siemens will invite investment banks in early April to pitch for roles in the initial public offering (IPO), which could be the biggest since the flotation of German energy group Innogy (IGY.DE) in October, the people said. They said that Goldman Sachs (GS.N) had already been asked to look after some preparatory tasks for the IPO. “Goldman Sachs will very likely emerge as one of the global coordinators of the Healthineers IPO,” one of the sources said, adding that Healthineers would be listed in late 2017 provided equity markets were favorable. Siemens and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Analysts estimate the business, Siemens’s most profitable, has an enterprise value of around 36 to 37 billion euros. Barclays Capital, which rates Siemens “equal weight”, estimates that that represents around 15 times 2018 earnings before interest, tax and amortization (EBITA), compared with 10.4 times for the trains-to-turbines group as a whole. “This is quite a high multiple factoring the strong cash generation and stable margin. However, top line growth has been muted and there are some headwinds ahead in both the U.S. and China, in our view,” Barclays analyst James Stettler said. Comparison with peers is difficult as they are divisions of conglomerates General Electric (GE.N), Philips (PHG.AS) and Toshiba (6502.T). Potential investors in the IPO may compare Healthineers to Baxter (BAX.N), Boston Scientific (BSX.N), Ambu (AMBUb.CO) and Dentsply Sirona (XRAY.O) - which trade at 17 to 30 times their core earnings - when making their decisions on how much they are willing to pay.  The IPO of a minority stake in Healthineers would give Siemens a currency for organic or inorganic investment in the business, which is a market leader in diagnostic imaging but needs to adapt fast to boost its exposure to growth segments. These include molecular diagnostics, which involves analyzing patients’ genetic make-up to help doctors with diagnosis, prognosis and treatment options, as well as advanced therapies and bespoke hospital services. This will not be cheap. U.S. medical technology group Danaher (DHR.N) in November bought fast-growing but loss-making Californian molecular diagnostics market leader Cepheid for $4 billion including debt, or just over six times sales, at a premium of 54 percent. “This (flotation) is the best option and the logical next step to provide flexible access to the capital markets and further strengthen the Healthineers business in the future,” Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser told investors on a call in November. Analysts say GenMark Diagnostics (GNMK.O) and Oxford Immunotec Global (OXFD.O) are future logical takeover targets in the sector. Siemens is now developing a next-generation lab diagnostics system, named Atellica, designed to leapfrog competitors such as Roche (ROG.S) and Abbott (ABT.N), but the move is expected to dilute profit margins for around two years. Last month, Siemens announced a $300 million investment and 700 new jobs at its Walpole, Massachusetts laboratory diagnostics manufacturing facility over the next four years to manufacture assays for Atellica. Analysts say Healthineers - which accounts for about 30 percent of divisional sales - has underperformed both its peers and expectations since Siemens created it in the last decade. It posted sales of 13.5 billion euros in the fiscal year to end-September, an increase of 5 percent. It had an EBIT margin of 17.2 percent, an improvement on the previous year’s 16.9 percent and the highest of any Siemens business. It has about 46,000 employees worldwide.
