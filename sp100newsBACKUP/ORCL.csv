1,ORCL,"Oracle Team USA admits rules violations, to return trophies","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oracle Team USA admitted it had violated the official rules on yacht modifications and would withdraw retroactively from the last four AC World Series regattas, which are part of the lead-up to the final America’s Cup race. Russell Coutts, chief executive for the team owned by software billionaire Larry Ellison, said in a statement late on Thursday that unauthorized modifications were made a year ago to its 45-foot catamarans without the knowledge of management. The team will return its prizes and trophies, he said. An Olympic gold medalist who has won the America’s Cup four times, Coutts said the modifications “had no impact on the performance of the boats.” “Our team is very disappointed by this turn of events, and I believe that voluntarily withdrawing from these past AC45 regattas is the appropriate corrective action,” he said. Oracle plans to race a different boat, a 72-foot double-hulled yacht, starting next month in its quest to keep the America’s Cup, the world’s oldest sporting trophy. Three teams have challenged Oracle. On Saturday, Italy’s Luna Rossa will race against Sweden’s Artemis Racing. If Italy wins Saturday’s race, it would then race Emirates Team New Zealand to decide who will compete against Oracle. Meanwhile, an international jury is investigating how weights were inserted into the wrong places on three of Oracle’s 45-foot boats, which the team last sailed in April. One of the boats belonged to Ben Ainslie, a four-time Olympic gold medalist who is training alongside the Oracle team for the America’s Cup races, which are set to begin September 7. “As skipper of the boat, I had no knowledge whatsoever that the boat was being raced out of measurement,” Ainslie said in an email to the jury. “I am deeply disappointed.” The America’s Cup organizers issued a statement saying they, too, were “surprised and disappointed” at the news. Team New Zealand, deemed the favorite of Oracle’s challengers, pounced on the news. “I find it difficult to believe that what we learned last night actually happened at the top level of our sport,” managing director Grant Dalton said in a statement on Friday. Ellison’s Oracle team won the cup in 2010 and with it the right to set the rules and choose San Francisco as the venue for this year’s competition. The sailing community has widely criticized Ellison’s decision to use high-tech catamarans that can sail as fast as 50 miles an hour on windy San Francisco Bay in light of a May accident that killed Andrew “Bart” Simpson. The British Olympic gold medalist was trapped beneath the Artemis boat when it capsized during a training exercise.

3,ORCL,"HP, ex-CEO Hurd win dismissal of lawsuit over harassment scandal","* Touting of business conduct rules held to be “puffery” * HP cleared Hurd of harassment; ex-CEO  now at Oracle By Jonathan Stempel Aug 12 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co and its former chief executive, Mark Hurd, have won dismissal of a lawsuit that challenged the computer maker’s public commitment to ethics at a time when Hurd was allegedly engaging in sexual harassment. HP did not violate securities laws despite making statements such as a commitment to be “open, honest, and direct in all our dealings” because such statements were too vague and general, U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco wrote on Friday. As a result, shareholders led by a New York City union pension fund cannot pursue fraud claims over Hurd’s alleged violations of HP’s standards of business conduct, the judge ruled. “Adoption of the plaintiff’s argument (would) render every code of ethics materially misleading whenever an executive commits an ethical violation following a scandal,” Tigar wrote. HP, which is based in Palo Alto, California, adopted new standards after a 2006 scandal over news leaks that had implicated several company executives and directors. Hurd resigned from HP in August 2010 after allegations that he sexually harassed independent consultant Jodie Fisher. An internal HP probe cleared Hurd of harassment but found that he filed inaccurate expense reports. Hurd, 56, is now president of Oracle Corp. The departure of Hurd, who had been widely credited with improving HP’s fortunes, led to a drop in the company’s share price. HP’s market value, which at the time topped $100 billion, has since fallen by roughly half, Reuters data show. Shareholders led by the Cement & Concrete Workers District Council Pension Fund of Flushing, New York, claimed in their lawsuit that the share price had been fraudulently inflated because of Hurd’s alleged activities. They also claimed that HP’s statements about its rules of conduct implied that Hurd was in compliance, and that Hurd ignored his duty to disclose violations. At most, Tigar said, such statements “constitute puffery - if the market was even aware of them.” Tigar also said Hurd’s alleged desire to keep his dealings with Fisher secret did not by itself give rise to a fraud claim. “Nothing suggests that Hurd thought that he could mislead investors with the statements the court finds were immaterial,” the judge wrote. Tigar gave the plaintiffs 30 days to amend their complaint. Ira Press, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond on Monday to requests for comment. HP spokesman Michael Thacker declined to comment. Lawrence Lewis, a lawyer for Hurd, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Oracle spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger declined to comment.

4,ORCL,Larry vs. Larry: Oracle's Ellison says Google's Page acted 'evil',"(Reuters) - Google’s informal motto is “don’t be evil,” but outspoken Silicon Valley billionaire Larry Ellison has accused the Internet company’s CEO, Larry Page, of acting “absolutely evil.” Ellison, the CEO and co-founder of software giant Oracle Corp, has long been famous for his zingers against business foes. He targeted Page as the two companies square off in a U.S. appeals court over a bitter lawsuit involving Google’s Android operating system. “We just think they took our stuff, and that was wrong,” Ellison said in an interview with Charlie Rose on “CBS This Morning,” which was aired on Tuesday. When asked if he thought Page was evil, Ellison replied: “I think what they did was absolutely evil.” He fell short of vilifying the man himself as evil. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment and an Oracle spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the Ellison interview. The attack on Page stems from Oracle’s acquisition of the Java programming platform, which it got with its 2010 purchase of Sun Microsystems. At the time Ellison said Java was the most valuable software asset he had ever acquired. Oracle sued Google in 2010, claiming that the Internet giant’s Android mobile operating system infringed Java patents. A federal judge last year ruled in favor of Google. Oracle is appealing. Over the years, Ellison has targeted the heads of long-time rivals such IBM, Microsoft and SAP, along with executives of companies he sought to acquire in hostile takeover battles. Last year, after Hasso Plattner, co-founder of the German software maker SAP announced plans to compete with Oracle in the database business, Ellison mocked the effort, saying: “Get me the name of that pharmacist, they must be on drugs.” In 2003 he quipped that he was tempted to shoot Craig Conway, the head of PeopleSoft who was fighting him in a high-profile hostile takeover battle that Ellison eventually won. The changing landscape in Silicon Valley has given him new targets. He lashed out at the entire board of long-time ally Hewlett-Packard Co, after directors replaced CEO Mark Hurd, a friend who he later hired as a president at Oracle. In 2011, Ellison mocked the cloud computing platform of rival Marc Benioff’s Salesforce.com Inc as a “roach motel” in a speech to thousands at an Oracle conference. “You can check in, but you can’t check out.” Benioff was a former protégé and the two recently publicly said they have patched up their differences. During the interview, which CBS said took place last week, Ellison also addressed controversy over the U.S. National Security Agency’s electronic surveillance programs. Ellison called the agency’s data collection “absolutely essential” for ferreting out potential terrorists and said it would be alarming only if data was used for political targeting. The U.S. government is one of the biggest customers of Oracle, which was founded more than 30 years ago and built a database for the CIA as one of its earliest projects. He also addressed the future of Apple Inc without his “best friend,” the late Steve Jobs at the helm, saying the maker of iPhones and Mac computers would not be nearly so successful. “I like Tim Cook,” he said about Jobs’ successor. “There are a lot of talented people there, but Steve is irreplaceable.” ",8132013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ellison-page/larry-vs-larry-oracles-ellison-says-googles-page-acted-evil-idUSBRE97C0HR20130813

7,ORCL,"China seen probing IBM, Oracle, EMC after Snowden leaks","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s Ministry of Public Security and a cabinet-level research center are preparing to investigate IBM Corp, Oracle Corp and EMC Corp over security issues, the official Shanghai Securities News said on Friday. The report follows revelations by former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden of widespread surveillance by the National Security Agency. It also comes as Beijing probes Western drugmakers over allegations of bribery and over-pricing. Documents leaked by Snowden revealed that the NSA has had access to vast amounts of Internet data such as emails, chat rooms and video from companies including Facebook Inc and Google Inc, under a government program known as Prism. “At present, thanks to their technological superiority, many of our core information technology systems are basically dominated by foreign hardware and software firms, but the Prism scandal implies security problems,” the newspaper quoted an anonymous source as saying. Officials with EMC, IBM and Oracle declined to comment. China’s Ministry of Public Security also declined to comment. The State Council’s Development Research Centre, one of the groups reportedly involved, told Reuters they were not carrying out such an investigation. China has been a focal point for the Snowden case since he stopped in Hong Kong en route to Moscow. He also claimed that the NSA hacked into critical network infrastructure at universities in China and in Hong Kong. Daniel Castro, a senior analyst with the Information Technology & Information Foundation, said he was concerned that a Chinese government probe could result in demands for U.S. companies to provide authorities with the blueprints to their technology so that Beijing can screen them for potential security threats. China, repeatedly accused by the United States of hacking, was given considerable ammunition by Snowden’s allegations, which Beijing has used to point the finger at Washington for hypocrisy. Chinese regulators and the police have begun a series of investigations in recent weeks into how foreign and domestic companies do business in the world’s second-biggest economy. “The Prism scandal certainly provides ample material for real concern,” said Mark Natkin, managing director of Beijing-based market intelligence firm Marbridge Consulting. “What the scandal has done is make it increasingly difficult to ascertain what is being done out of legitimate concern and what may be being done for any sort of political reasons,” said Natkin. Some experts have warned that Snowden’s leaks could hurt the sales of U.S. technology companies in Asia and Europe, as reports of their complicity with NSA spying programs may lead foreign businesses and governments to purchase equipment and services from non-U.S. suppliers. The foundation, a think tank, last week projected that U.S. cloud computing firms could lose $21.5 billion in sales over the next three years, eventually ceding 10 percent of the foreign market to European and Asian competitors.

11,ORCL,CORRECTED-Cheating scandal threatens Oracle's America's Cup defense,"(In paragraph nine, changes “overweight” to “illegally modified”) By Ronnie Cohen SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 26 (Reuters) - After years of preparation and countless controversies, software mogul Larry Ellison’s Oracle Team USA is poised to defend the America’s Cup against Emirates Team New Zealand beginning September 7. But first it must beat back a cheating scandal that threatens to blacken the reputation of Oracle and several of the biggest names in yacht racing, and could make it harder for the American team to hang on to the 162-year-old trophy. An international jury of five sailing experts has been trying to determine exactly how three Oracle catamarans competing in preliminary regattas known as the America’s Cup World Series came to be altered with heavier fittings and illegal lead and resin hidden in their frames. The jury will hold a hearing on Thursday in San Francisco, and is expected to shortly thereafter rule on whether individual Oracle team members have engaged in “gross misconduct,” and whether the team as a whole has brought disrepute to the event. Oracle could be docked points in the Cup regatta, which it can ill-afford in the face of what looks to be a stout challenge from New Zealand, which on Sunday clinched the challenger slot by beating Italy’s team in the Louis Vuitton Cup. Individual Oracle sailors and shore crew members—though not the team itself—could be banned from the event. “There has been cheating going on. I won’t use any other word because it is obviously cheating,” said Bob Fisher, 78-year-old yachtsman and author of a history of the America’s Cup. “It looks really bad.” The alterations came to light at the end of July, when an America’s Cup measurement committee examining an Oracle 45-foot catamaran in advance of a youth sailing regatta found that a piece of the yacht’s carbon-fiber structure known as a king post weighed 5.2 pounds more than it should have. The American team had sailed the yacht - a smaller version of the 72-foot catamarans being used for the Cup itself - and two others that were also illegally modified, to win the World Series competition. In contrast to the Cup boats, which can be customized within a strict set of rules, all the so-called AC45s used in the World Series were built to the same specifications in the same New Zealand boat shop at the same time. After a measurement committee notified Oracle about the extra weight, team chief executive Russell Coutts offered a quick mea culpa and Oracle formally forfeited its victories. Coutts, a legendary New Zealand sailor who skippered his country’s boat to America’s Cup victory in 1995 and 2000, said unauthorized modifications had been made to the boats without management’s knowledge. Competitors and others in the sailing community quickly derided that explanation, saying they could not imagine skippers sailing without knowing their boats had been altered. Still, Ben Ainslie, one of Oracle’s two helmsmen, would appear to have a good alibi: he was sailing for his fourth Olympic gold medal last summer when the extra weight was added to a yacht that he later skippered in the World Series. “Obviously someone on the team thought it was the best place to put the weight,” Ainslie told Reuters. “I don’t know if they even realized they were breaking the rule. “It’s frustrating for us, but 99.9 percent of the team have nothing to do with it.” Whoever did it was not very smooth. An August 15 measurement committee report described “a discolored plastic bag secured with multiple cable ties” that was filled with lead and resin and was “so tightly wedged into the kingpost that it could not be removed intact.” Oracle insists it gained no competitive edge from the added weight. Yet some sailors wondered if other, more significant  alterations could have been made but later removed, leaving just the few telltale lead-filled bags that the measurement committee uncovered. Ironically, Oracle last year pushed to add a rule about harming the sport’s reputation. Dubbed the “the Dalton rule,” some say it stemmed from the American team’s effort to muzzle Grant Dalton, New Zealand’s outspoken managing director, who has repeatedly criticized the 2013 America’s Cup event. The Dalton rule empowers the jury to punish Oracle by subtracting points before the best-of-17 races begin. Ellison’s Oracle team, as defending champion, had the right to set the rules, specify boat design and choose the venue for this year’s competition. But the decision to use expensive, high-tech 72-foot catamarans, which can travel faster than 50 miles an hour, has been fiercely criticized for keeping many competitors away and making the races too dangerous. A British Olympian, Andrew “Bart” Simpson, was killed in a training accident in May. Oracle referred questions to Tom Ehman of the Golden Gate Yacht Club, which is sponsoring Oracle and the America’s Cup event. Ehman said he was not allowed to discuss questions pending before the international jury. Ehman has launched accusations of his own, alleging that New Zealand and Italy’s Luna Rossa had trespassed on the Oracle AC45s during a “reconnaissance mission.” He lodged a formal protest last week and then withdrew it, saying he needed more time to gather evidence. “We have multiple witnesses who said members of Team Emirates and Luna Rossa were climbing all over our AC45s to find something,” he said. “Whether it’s a technical trespass under California law, I don’t know, but it’s bad sportsmanship.” Some watching the sport say the recent events are in keeping with a history of gamesmanship in the modern America’s Cup, dating to a 1983 controversy when Australia imposed a blanket of secrecy over its innovative winged keel. “It’s coming down to the final event, and there’s a lot of posturing,” said sailor and author John Rousmaniere, who writes about sailing and the history of the America’s Cup. “They’ve been working on this for three years. Generally, it builds as the finals get closer and closer.” For New Zealand, which looked very polished in routing Italy’s Luna Rossa in the challengers’ competition but has yet to be truly tested, the scandal is something of a gift. “We’re apprehensive because we think they’re fast,” Dalton said of Oracle at a news conference Sunday. “They look really good, but they’ve got to get through next week as well.”     (Editing by Jonathan Weber and Alden Bentley)",8262013,http://www.reuters.com/article/sailing-americascup-cheating/corrected-cheating-scandal-threatens-oracles-americas-cup-defense-idUSL2N0GQ0BJ20130826

13,ORCL,Oracle hit with unprecedented penalties for America's Cup cheating,"San Francisco (Reuters) - Software mogul Larry Ellison’s Oracle Team USA suffered a major setback in its effort to retain the America’s Cup sailing trophy when an international jury on Tuesday docked the team two points and kicked three team members out of the event for adding illegal weight to Oracle boats. The penalties, unprecedented in the history of the 162-year-old event, are a big boost for challenger Emirates Team New Zealand, which will face off against Oracle in the Cup finals beginning on Saturday. New Zealand demolished other would-be challengers in the qualifying races, and bookmakers have made it a slight favorite to take the trophy from Oracle. The Cup finals are a best-of-17 series, and Oracle will now enter the event two points behind: it will need to win 11 races to win the series, while New Zealand will only need to win 9. Oracle will also be sailing without a key crew member, Dirk de Ridder, a 40-year-old Dutchman who was banished from the event for his role in the weight scandal. Another Oracle sailor was suspended for the first 4 races, and two shore crew members were barred from any further participation. The scandal first came to light in July, when 45-foot Oracle catamarans that had been used for a preliminary series known as the America’s Cup World Series of Racing - and were raced again last week in a youth competition - were found to have illegal bags of lead and resin wedged into their frames. Oracle said the team had gained no advantage from the extra weight and that the skippers and team’s managers were unaware of the alterations, but it nonetheless agreed to forfeit its World Series victories. The 45-foot catamarans, unlike the 72-foot boats being used in the main event, were a “one-design” class, meaning all teams were supposed to have exactly the same boat. An international jury of five sailing experts was charged with investigating the situation. In a report released Tuesday, it said it had found five instances of prohibited modifications in three Oracle boats. “The incidents are serious and unprecedented in the America’s Cup,” the jury report said. “The seriousness of the breaches cannot be understated.” Oracle was also ordered to pay $250,000 in penalties to two charitable foundations. “The rules infractions involved only a few of our 130 team members, and were done without the knowledge of either our team’s management or the skippers who were driving the boats,” said Oracle team CEO Russell Coutts in a statement. “While we disagree with the unprecedented penalties imposed by the jury, we have no choice but to make the necessary changes to personnel on our race boat and do our best to use the next four days for the new team to practice and get ready for the start of the 34th America’s Cup.” For Ellison, who won the Cup in a controversial 2010 match off the coast of Spain, the sanctions are the latest embarrassment in a Cup regatta where little has gone as planned. With many potential participants scared off by the cost and complexity of the AC72 boats, only three teams challenged for the Cup, undermining the economics of the event. A training accident in May killed a British sailor and forced contentious safety-related changes in the rules. Attendance is also far below projections, with most in San Francisco paying little attention to the event. Still, many observers expect the finals series to be competitive, which could yet vindicate Ellison’s decision to use high-tech catamarans that can reach speeds of more than 50 miles per hour. Ellison has not commented publicly on the cheating scandal.

14,ORCL,UPDATE 2-Sailing-New Zealand outsails Oracle on day one of America's Cup finals,"By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Emirates Team New Zealand outsailed billionaire Larry Ellison’s Oracle Team USA in the first day of the America’s Cup finals with near collisions and a man overboard as the high-tech catamarans crisscrossed San Francisco Bay in the first close-fought duels since the regatta began two months ago. Maneuvering his 72-foot carbon-fiber yacht at speeds close to 45 miles per hour, Emirates Team New Zealand skipper Dean Barker aggressively cut off Cup defender Oracle’s boat several times to win the first two races in the best-of-17 final series. Already hobbled by a cheating penalty, Saturday’s results make it even harder for Oracle to defend the Cup it won in Valencia, Spain in 2010 and brought to San Francisco. The final series of matches is the culmination of a regatta plagued by controversies including cheating by Oracle, dangerous catamarans, a fatal accident and accusations of mismanagement. Fans along the shore at an America’s Cup park on San Francisco Bay cheered the Kiwis as their AC72 catamaran crossed the finish line with a lead of nearly a minute in the day’s second race. Seconds before the first race, an Oracle crewman fell overboard, leaving his team to compete with only 10 sailors. New Zealand began that match with a small lead and was passed by Oracle for a short time before regaining its lead and winning by 36 seconds. “Hopefully we can take some races and not have passes and just win,” Oracle tactician John Kostecki said at a post race press conference, when asked if the boats were evenly matched. In pre-start maneuvering of the second race, the two boats appeared to touch each other as Oracle went for a controlling position just downwind of the Kiwis. Even a light collision could have cost New Zealand a penalty, but none  was called. Saturday’s was the first suspenseful racing in the regatta after two months of relatively tame qualifying matches easily dominated by the formidable Kiwis. The latest setback for the America’s Cup came on Tuesday, when an international jury docked Oracle two points - the equivalent of two races - and kicked three team members out of the event for adding illegal weight to boats used in a previous preparatory Cup competition. The penalties, unprecedented in the history of the 162-year-old event, are a big boost for New Zealand, which demolished other would-be challengers in qualifying races in July and August. Bookmakers see the Kiwis as favorites to take the America’s Cup from Oracle although, in a twist of fate, they are now up against one of their country’s most accomplished sailors. Due to the penalty, Oracle needs to win 11 races to retain the Cup, while New Zealand only needs to win a total of nine. With Saturday’s two victories, New Zealand now needs seven more. Oracle is also sailing without a key crew member, Dirk de Ridder, a 40-year-old Dutchman who was banished from the event for his role in the weight scandal. The cheating debacle first came to light in July, when 45-foot Oracle catamarans that had been used for a regatta known as the America’s Cup World Series of Racing - and were raced again last week in a youth competition - were found to have illegal bags of lead and resin wedged into their frames. Adding weight can help improve the yachts’ stability. In most countries, sailboat racing is a niche sport, and this year’s America’s Cup so far has done little to change that. Ellison, who won the cup in 2010, and with it the right to set the rules for this year’s races, hoped to make the competition more accessible to everyday sports fans with super-fast, high-tech 72-foot boats called AC72s sailing close to shore on the picturesque Bay. But the regatta stumbled from the start, with high costs scaring off many challengers and a fatal training accident in May throwing the four-team competition into chaos. Mounting a serious challenge in the America’s Cup costs $100 million or more, a pricey entry fee even for billionaires. Sailing is not a big draw for US sports fans and the turnout in viewing areas set up along the Bay to watch the races has fallen short of expectations, with few local residents showing interest in the regatta, let alone rooting for Oracle. But the sport is a major sport in New Zealand. New Zealand’s crew is made up entirely of people from that country, while Oracle Team USA’s crew has only a smattering of Americans. New Zealand first won the Cup in 1995 and then successfully defended the Cup in 2000 under the leadership of Wellington-born skipper Russell Coutts. Coutts was lured away by Swiss biotechnology billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli to take the helm of Alinghi. He took the Cup from New Zealand in 2003, then switched to Oracle and helped that team win the Cup in 2010, and he continues to lead the team. He has won the America’s Cup four times and never lost. New Zealand skipper Barker’s aggressive starts against Oracle were foreshadowed by his scrappy pre-start tactics against Italy’s Luna Rossa in qualifying races leading up to the finals. On the water on Saturday, Oracle’s catamaran was skippered by Australian James Spithill, who also skippered Oracle’s boat in its 2010 Cup victory. “The boats are very close and tomorrow’s another day,” Oracle skipper Jimmy Spithill said after the races.

In the first of two races on Saturday, which kicked off a best-of-17 final series to win the Cup, the two teams’ catamarans nearly collided on several occasions as they crisscrossed the bay.

17,ORCL,RPT-Sailing-Oracle win shows New Zealand has not locked up America's Cup,"By Alden Bentley and Ronnie Cohen SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Oracle Team USA edged out Emirates Team New Zealand in a blustery fourth race for the America’s Cup on Sunday, reminding the Kiwis, who won the first three races of the event, that the American yacht is formidable. While government-backed New Zealand won the third heat of the 17-race final series on San Francisco Bay, software billionaire Larry Ellison’s Oracle team led the first half of that match and controlled the entire fourth race, cruising into the finish about eight seconds in front of the Kiwis. Though Oracle started the finals behind by two races due to a jury-imposed cheating penalty, the series now looks like a contest between two well-matched, high-tech 72-foot catamarans. “A lesser team probably would have crumbled in the fourth race,” a jubilant Oracle skipper Jimmy Spithill said at a news conference. “It feels good to shift the momentum over towards us.” Oracle had better starts near the fog-enshrouded Golden Gate Bridge than New Zealand in both Sunday races. In the first Spithill forced the challengers into a right-of-way infraction that prompted a penalty. But the Kiwis got around the Americans in an upwind tacking dual on the third leg off Alcatraz Island. Oracle was unable to regain the lead, trailing by 28 seconds at the finish line. The New Zealand boat looked fast upwind, turning a 17-second Oracle lead at the mark ending the first downwind leg, into a 29-second advantage over Oracle at the windward turning mark near the Golden Gate. Oracle’s AC72 seemed to excel when the wind increased to over 20 knots (23 miles per hour) in the second race of the day. Spithill, an Australian, used aggressive pre-start tactics to claim the advantageous position as the race kicked off. The American team blocked every move Team New Zealand made to stay ahead at each of the five marks and reached a top  speed of 46 knots (53 mph). Despite what might have been a costly mistake, splashing his twin hulls back into the water off the hydrofoils too early at the third mark, he recovered and maintained a slightly higher average speed over New Zealand around the course. Racing continues on Tuesday and Thursday. With two matches on each day, New Zealand could take back the “Auld Mug,” as the Cup in called in the sailing world, on Saturday. Bookmakers contemplated a Kiwi sweep, but given Sunday’s close races, New Zealand still has an uphill battle. “We want to keep the Cup here in the Bay,” Spithill said. “These guys want to take it to New Zealand.” To hold onto the Cup, Oracle needs two victories more than New Zealand. The Kiwis must win nine races to take the 162-year-old trophy. Oracle needs to win 11 because of a punishment for making illegal modifications to 45-foot catamarans it used in warm-up regattas. Kiwi managing director Grant Dalton crewed on his yacht in Sunday’s first race. But after manning one of the pedestal grinders that provide the power to the yacht’s moving parts, the 56-year old took a break for the second race. A reporter asked New Zealand skipper Dean Barker if he could blame the lost race on Dalton’s absence. Barker chuckled and said he remained confident in his team’s ability despite the loss. “We sailed by our standards a pretty average race, and we still sailed a close race,” he said. If New Zealand wins the Cup, Dalton has said he would use the defender’s right to set rules to force teams competing in the next America’s Cup to employ only sailors from their home countries. A nationality rule could heavily favor New Zealand, a sailing-crazed nation that produced many of the yachtsmen in this year’s America’s Cup competition. Only two of Oracle’s sailors are Americans, and another two come from New Zealand. In contrast, all but two of New Zealand’s sailors hail from the tiny island nation.

20,ORCL,Ben Ainslie could replace Oracle tactician in America's Cup,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A blunder on Tuesday that led to a commanding victory for Emirates Team Zealand and prompted Oracle Team USA to call an unusual time-out in the 34th America’s Cup regatta might have cost sailor John Kostecki his job. The 49-year-old American was nowhere to be seen when software magnate Larry Ellison’s team got back on its 72-foot catamaran for a practice run on Wednesday after Tuesday’s devastating loss. Acclaimed British sailor Sir Ben Ainslie, who has been at the helm of Oracle’s second yacht during training matches, took his place. Oracle representatives did not immediately respond to calls and emails asking for confirmation that Ainslie would replace Kostecki as the tactician when Oracle again faces Team New Zealand for two races on Thursday. The government-backed Kiwis have won four of the nine races they need to take the Auld Mug, as they call the silver trophy, back to their tiny, sailing-crazed island nation. Because of a jury-imposed penalty, Oracle must finish first in 11 races - two more than New Zealand. Ainslie, 36, has won four Olympic gold medals and is considered one of the most decorated sailors of all time. Though Oracle flies the American flag, the loss of Kostecki would leave only one U.S. sailor on the team, trimmer Rome Kirby. All but two of the Kiwi sailors hail from New Zealand. Oracle was winning the race on Tuesday when it tried to do something that has never before been done - to lift its foils out of the water while tacking. But the team bungled the maneuver, almost stopped dead and gave up an eight-second lead. Criticism was also heaped on Oracle for heading to the right side of the upwind leg near Alcatraz Island to escape current, allowing the Kiwis to use better wind in the center of the course to get ahead. The team used a so-called postponement card to skip the second race of the day. Skipper Jimmy Spithill said Oracle would return to the water to figure out how to make the hard-to-handle twin-hulled yacht move faster before two races scheduled for Thursday. Asked at a post-race press conference if Kostecki would be fired, Spithill said, “I can’t guarantee anything. I can’t guarantee I’ll be there.” An international jury expelled Kostecki’s brother-in-law, first-choice wing trimmer Dirk de Ridder, after finding he and other team members illegally modified smaller, prototype boats used in warm-up regattas. Kostecki grew up sailing on San Francisco Bay and is said to have been hired as Oracle’s tactician because of his insider knowledge. Asked at a press conference on Sunday if his local knowledge had given him a leg up on the Kiwis, he replied, “I think these guys know the Bay pretty well.” ",9112013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sailing-americascup-oracle/ben-ainslie-could-replace-oracle-tactician-in-americas-cup-idUSBRE98A1DG20130911

Oracle representatives did not immediately respond to calls and emails asking for confirmation that Ainslie would replace Kostecki as the tactician when Oracle again faces Team New Zealand for two races on Thursday. The government-backed Kiwis have won four of the nine races they need to take the Auld Mug, as they call the silver trophy, back to their tiny, sailing-crazed island nation. Because of a jury-imposed penalty, Oracle must finish first in 11 races - two more than New Zealand. Ainslie, 36, has won four Olympic gold medals and is considered one of the most decorated sailors of all time. Though Oracle flies the American flag, the loss of Kostecki would leave only one U.S. sailor on the team, trimmer Rome Kirby. All but two of the Kiwi sailors hail from New Zealand. Oracle was winning the race on Tuesday when it tried to do something that has never before been done - to lift its foils out of the water while tacking. But the team bungled the maneuver, almost stopped dead and gave up an eight-second lead. Criticism was also heaped on Oracle for heading to the right side of the upwind leg near Alcatraz Island to escape current, allowing the Kiwis to use better wind in the center of the course to get ahead. The team used a so-called postponement card to skip the second race of the day. Skipper Jimmy Spithill said Oracle would return to the water to figure out how to make the hard-to-handle twin-hulled yacht move faster before two races scheduled for Thursday. Asked at a post-race press conference if Kostecki would be fired, Spithill said, “I can’t guarantee anything. I can’t guarantee I’ll be there.” An international jury expelled Kostecki’s brother-in-law, first-choice wing trimmer Dirk de Ridder, after finding he and other team members illegally modified smaller, prototype boats used in warm-up regattas. Kostecki grew up sailing on San Francisco Bay and is said to have been hired as Oracle’s tactician because of his insider knowledge. Asked at a press conference on Sunday if his local knowledge had given him a leg up on the Kiwis, he replied, “I think these guys know the Bay pretty well.”",9112013,http://www.reuters.com/article/sailing-americascup-oracle/sailing-ben-ainslie-could-replace-oracle-tactician-in-americas-cup-idUSL2N0H72NH20130911
22,ORCL,Oracle calls time out in America's Cup after Kiwi trouncing,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Embattled defending champion Oracle Team USA postponed a second America’s Cup race on Tuesday, saying it needed to regroup after Emirates Team New Zealand won its fourth commanding victory on San Francisco Bay. Software billionaire Larry Ellison’s American team appeared shell-shocked and asked for the time out just before the start of race two, under a rule giving the teams the right to delay one race in the 17-race series for the world’s oldest sporting trophy. The so-called postponement card is generally reserved for boat breakdowns. “We feel like we need to regroup,” skipper Jimmy Spithill said at a post-race press conference. “It’s obvious we’ve got to make some changes.” Oracle faces an uphill battle, having started the regatta with a two-race penalty and without its first-choice wing-sail trimmer, Dirk de Ridder. An international jury punished the team for illegally modifying its smaller, 45-foot practice catamarans in a preliminary regatta. The unprecedented cheating penalty means that for Oracle to keep the Cup it must win 11 races - two more than government-backed New Zealand. Although the score on the water is 4-1, Oracle officially lags the Kiwis 4-0 due to the infraction. On Tuesday, Oracle won the race start and cruised in its 72-foot catamaran past New Zealand to lead the first two legs of the five-leg heat, that saw average winds of 20 knots (23 mph). Then Oracle tried to do something that has never been done - to lift its foils out of the water while tacking. It bungled the rounding maneuver with a eight-second lead at the second mark, almost stopping dead, which allowed the Kiwis to close the gap. Oracle’s decision to go to the right side of the upwind leg, out of the current near Alcatraz Island, also proved disastrous. The New Zealanders had better wind toward the center of the course, were able to get past Oracle after several tacks and led them by 1 minute 17 seconds at mark three. Team New Zealand finished the race 65 seconds ahead of Oracle. “The boat is going really well upwind,” Kiwi skipper Dean Barker said after the race. “It’s working for us.” But he said he had no intention of laying back. “There’s no easy races,” he said. A breakdown now could be devastating for Oracle, which can no longer postpone and needs to win another 10 races, while New Zealand needs just five more wins. Spithill continued to express confidence that his team could keep the 162-year-old trophy. “It’s not over,” he said. “As a team, we’ve come back from a lot of adversity. This doesn’t worry us. We’ve been here before, and it’s just a matter of getting back working again.” Asked what he would change, Spithill said everything was on the table - from sail changes to crew changes. Asked if he was concerned about his job, he responded, “You can be a rooster one day and a feather duster the next day.” Emirates Team New Zealand won three of the first four races. But, after a shaky start, Oracle Team USA charged back with a vengeance on Sunday, leading much of the third duel, winning the fourth and proving itself a formidable competitor. The radical 72-foot catamarans looked evenly matched in Sunday’s racing and overall the competition has been more exciting than many expected, featuring dramatic starting maneuvers, near collisions, lead changes and closely fought tacking duels. The cheating scandal, quarrels over rules and grief over the death of a sailor during a training exercise took center stage during the preliminaries, when a promised “summer of racing” to determine which yacht could take on Oracle fizzled into a lopsided series with powerhouse Team New Zealand dominating. Now the TV network-dubbed “September Showdown” is delivering high-adrenaline, edge-of-the seat racing in San Francisco Bay’s natural amphitheater. Flag-waving fans have watched in awe along the waterfront as giant twin-hulled yachts with three-story tall wing sails cross within inches of one another, and scream into the finish line on hydrofoils barely a stone throw from the America’s Cup pavilion. The yachts look like airplanes flying when their foils lift the hulls out of the choppy water. With 11 sailors on board, the yachts have cruised as fast as 53 miles an hour around the five-leg race course, starting near the Golden Gate Bridge, sailing past Alcatraz Island and finishing against the backdrop of the San Francisco Bay Bridge. Ellison and his crew desperately want to keep the Cup. But the Kiwi team has vowed to bring the Auld Mug, as they call it, back to its Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron. Team New Zealand held the trophy from 1995 until 2003 with the Kiwi sailor Sir Russell Coutts at the helm. He now runs the Oracle Team USA. The 51-year-old Olympic gold medalist has won the America’s Cup four times, twice for his homeland. Ellison chose the 72-foot catamarans as the boats and his home waters of San Francisco Bay as the venue for this year’s competition. Critics complained that the boats were too fragile and hard to handle after Olympic gold medalist Andrew Simpson of Britain was killed in a May training exercise for Sweden’s Artemis Racing.

23,ORCL,"UPDATE 1-Sailing-Kiwis win America's Cup race 6, Oracle running out of options","By Ronnie Cohen SAN FRANCISCO, September 12 (Reuters) - Oracle Team USA’s bid to turn the tide in its floundering America’s Cup campaign by bringing sailing supers tar Ben Ainslie aboard failed on Thursday, when Emirates Team New Zealand crushed them in a fifth race. The government-backed Kiwis now have scored more than half the victories they need to bring home the trophy the yachting world refers to as the Auld Mug. After winning the start in its high-speed, 72-foot catamaran, Oracle lost the lead upwind on the third leg,, and New Zealand surged to the finish 47 seconds ahead. The Kiwis spotted the American boat’s Achilles heel - its poor tacking ability - and forced it into having to perform a dozen of the taxing maneuvers Ainslie, knighted for his racing success on the water, tried to rescue Oracle, taking over on Thursday as the team’s top decision-maker. “Ben did a great job,” Oracle skipper Jimmy Spithill said. “We can’t change the last race. What we can do is go out and win a race, and that’s what we’re going to do.” A second race is scheduled on Thursday. The most successful Olympic sailor of all time, Ainslie will sail as the tactician aboard the 72-foot catamaran in place of American John Kostecki. Earlier this week a tactical blunder by Kostecki cost Oracle a lead, allowed the Kiwis to cruise into a commanding fourth victory, and prompted the American team to call for an unusual time-out. “It’s clear we need to improve performance, and with that comes changes,” Kostecki, 49, said. “I’ll fill whatever role is best to help us win.” Team New Zealand needs to wing four more races to take the 162-year-old trophy back to its sailing-crazed island nation, while software mogul Larry Ellison’s Oracle team still needs to win 10 races to hold onto the Cup. Oracle started the regatta two points behind because of an unprecedented jury-imposed punishment for illegally modifying the team’s smaller, prototype boats sailed in warm-up races. “I’m happy to step up and do what’s best for the team,” Ainslie said in a prepared statement. The 36-year-old sailor has been at the helm of Oracle’s second yacht during training matches. Though Oracle flies the American flag, substituting Ainslie for Kostecki leaves only one U.S. sailor on the team, trimmer Rome Kirby. All but two of the Kiwi sailors hail from New Zealand. Oracle’s devastating loss on Tuesday prompted the team to play its so-called postponement card and cancel a second race of the day so it could regroup. The only crew change was the promotion of Ainslie - a record five-time Olympic medalist knighted by the Princess Royal at Buckingham Palace in March. A supreme tactician, Ainslie is known for bouncing back from bad races. His work as a sparring partner for Team New Zealand’s skipper Dean Barker in Valencia, Spain, in 2007 could help him in the races for the America’s Cup trophy. Ainslie has set winning the “Auld Mug,” as the Cup is called, as his primary goal. Oracle was winning the race against powerhouse New Zealand on Tuesday when it tried to do something that has never before been done — to lift its foils out of the water while tacking. The team bungled the maneuver, almost stopped dead and gave up an eight-second lead. The international jury that punished Oracle in the biggest cheating scandal in Cup history also expelled Kostecki’s brother-in-law, first-choice Oracle wing trimmer Dirk de Ridder for making illegal boat alterations. Kostecki grew up sailing on San Francisco Bay and was hired as Oracle’s tactician at least in part for his insider knowledge. Ellison won the world’s oldest sporting trophy in Valencia in 2010 and with it the right to choose his home San Francisco Bay waters as the venue and the fragile and hard-to-handle twin-hulled yachts with 13-story rigid wing sails as the vessels. Sailors have criticized the Oracle chief executive’s decisions, particularly after British Olympic gold medalist Andrew “Bart” Simpson was killed when the AC72 of Sweden’s Artemis Racing capsized during a May practice exercise. Ainslie grew up sailing with and against Simpson in British youth squads. Losing Simpson was crushing for Ainslie. He delivered a tribute at his friend’s funeral.",9122013,http://www.reuters.com/article/sailing-americascup/update-1-sailing-kiwis-win-americas-cup-race-6-oracle-running-out-of-options-idUSL2N0H82D420130912

26,ORCL,Sailing-Oracle losing grasp on America's Cup as Kiwis win sixth,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oracle Team USA’s bid to turn the tide in its floundering America’s Cup campaign by bringing sailing superstar Ben Ainslie aboard failed on Thursday, when Emirates Team New Zealand crushed the defenders in two do-or-die races. The Kiwis now have scored six of the nine victories they need to bring home the trophy the yachting world refers to as the Auld Mug. Oracle, slapped with a jury-imposed two-race penalty, has won only one race and still needs to win another 10 to keep the 162-year-old trophy. Government-backed New Zealand finished 66 seconds ahead of software billionaire Larry Ellison’s Oracle in its high-speed, 72-foot catamaran in the second race of the day and 47 seconds ahead in the first heat. “We cannot give up,” said Oracle skipper Jimmy Spithill at a post-race news conference. “We’ll keep fighting all the way to the end. I’m still convinced we can win races.” In Thursday’s first race, the sixth of the series, Oracle won the start but lost the lead upwind on the third leg. In the second match, New Zealand won the start and kept the lead throughout. Oracle has looked slow against New Zealand on the upwind legs, where it has forfeited leading positions in five races. The Kiwis in Thursday’s first race forced Oracle into having to perform a dozen of the taxing maneuvers as the huge catamarans zigzagged into a light 12-knot breeze to the windward mark. Spithill said the upwind speed differential caught his team off guard. “I think it is a shock that they’ve got the edge upwind,” he said. But he added: “There’s a lot of racing to go. It’s a long way from over in my mind.” New Zealand used an aggressive match racing “dial-down” tactic in race six to pass Oracle. The challenger had the right of way as it was about to cross tacks with its foe, and by aiming straight at Oracle forced it to duck and lose distance. Ainslie, the most successful Olympic sailor of all time, was knighted for his achievements on the water. He took over as tactician aboard the AC72 from American John Kostecki. The 36-year old Briton was the skipper of Oracle’s second yacht during training matches and remains a fearful competitor for New Zealand. “It feels nice to have won six races, but it’s only two-thirds of the way toward winning the America’s Cup,” New Zealand skipper Dean Barker told reporters. “We know it’s far from over.” Earlier this week, a tactical blunder by Kostecki cost Oracle a lead, allowed the Kiwis to cruise into a commanding fourth victory, and prompted the American team to call for an unusual time-out.

28,ORCL,Oracle narrows gap in America's Cup after Kiwis almost capsize,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Billionaire Larry Ellison’s Oracle Team USA scored a desperately needed win in the America’s Cup finals on Saturday, chipping away at Emirates Team New Zealand’s extensive lead after the Kiwis nearly capsized their yacht. New Zealand began the eighth match in the best-of-17 Cup finals with a lead over Oracle, but in a maneuver during an upward leg skipper Dean Barker briefly lost control when the boat’s hydraulically controlled, 135-foot-tall wing sail got stuck. The AC72 catamaran teetered on one hull for several seconds before dropping back in the water. That gave Oracle a chance to get out in front and it went on to win the race by 52 seconds, just its second victory in the 17-match series in San Francisco Bay. “We didn’t get the hydraulics and if the wing doesn’t tack when the boat does, you’re in trouble,” Barker said. “Fortunately the boat came up and no collision with the other guys.” Due to rising winds, organizers abandoned a second scheduled race, which New Zealand had been winning. Aggressive tactics and solidly executed maneuvers have helped the Kiwis dominate racing since the final series of races for the 162-year old trophy began last week. Barring a catastrophic misstep by New Zealand, which its near-capsize easily could have become, experts say Oracle has little chance of catching up. The Kiwis, backed by the New Zealand government, have scored six victories against Oracle and need only three more to win. The next two races are scheduled for Sunday. Ellison’s Oracle, slapped with a jury-imposed two-race penalty, has won only two races and still needs to win another nine to keep the Cup, which the yachting world refers to as the Auld Mug. Since the teams began competing a week ago, Oracle has suffered against New Zealand on upwind legs, where it has repeatedly forfeited early leads. The Kiwis have maneuvered Oracle into disadvantaged positions near race-course boundaries and forced Skipper Jimmy Spithill to perform extra maneuvers as the huge catamarans zigzagged across the bay. But in Saturday’s match Oracle had closed distance in the upwind tacking duel, and was close to crossing ahead before the Kiwi mishap. Oracle on Thursday replaced tactician John Kostecki with British sailing superstar Ben Ainslie, but that change has done little to turn the tide of the team’s floundering Cup defense. “It doesn’t mean it can’t be turned around, but it would take some sort of brilliant swordsmanship on the part of Oracle, some flash of fire from the heavens,” said Kimball Livingston, a competitive sailor and writer at blueplanettimes.com. Oracle started the regatta two points behind because of an unprecedented jury-imposed punishment for illegally modifying the team’s smaller, prototype boats sailed in warm-up races.

Oracle also came up with the AC72 yachts, which can hydrofoil across the waves at 50 miles per hour. In May it became tragically clear how dangerous the twin-hulled yachts were, when a sailor was killed in the capsize of the AC72 sailed by Artemis Racing. In response to that accident, organizers created additional rules, including the more conservative wind limits that affected Saturday’s racing, in order to make the AC72s safer.

Aggressive tactics and near-perfect maneuvers have helped the Kiwis dominate racing on San Francisco Bay since the final series of 17 match races for the 162-year old trophy began last week.

32,ORCL,New Zealand and U.S. boats split thrilling America's Cup races,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oracle Team USA and Emirates Team New Zealand split two dramatic races on Sunday, winning one each in heavy winds on San Francisco Bay and sending the America’s Cup sailing regatta into a tense and unexpectedly close final week of competition. The second race was among the most thrilling in America’s Cup history as the two teams changed leads four times, dueling neck-and-neck for much of the course before New Zealand eked out a 17-second victory. “If you didn’t enjoy today’s racing you should probably watch another sport,” New Zealand skipper Dean Barker said at a new conference afterward. New Zealand won a very close start and barely maintained its controlling inside position against a faster Oracle around the first mark, before slingshotting to a lead. Oracle made a poor turn rounding the second mark, but steadily gained ground on the upwind leg - as it had done in the previous two races - putting the duel into a dead heat at the third mark. On the final downwind leg, Oracle skipper Jimmy Spithill had to steer behind the Kiwi boat as the two 72-foot catamarans converged, but he slowed too much and made a longer turn, allowing New Zealand to sail away to the win. Despite the second-race loss, Oracle showed again Sunday that changes it had made to its boat after losing six of the first seven finals races, combined with much-improved tacking, had closed the speed gap with New Zealand. “You are constantly learning,” said Oracle skipper Jimmy Spithill. “This is the most we’ve learned, lining up against these guys. Even after today we have a heap of stuff we’d like to do with the boat.” In the first race Sunday, Oracle won the start and stomped on the gas pedal in the initial run with the wind. It opened up an 18-second lead and then showed a significant speed advantage on the upwind leg to all but seal a 47-second victory. Oracle tactician and British Olympic gold medalist Ben Ainslie afterward said it was “the most fun and exciting sailing I’ve ever been involved with - to see these two teams get a grip on these boats and what they are capable of.” After its second-race win, New Zealand led the competition seven races to one, with Oracle’s first two wins having been negated by a cheating penalty before the finals began. The first team to score nine points will take home the 162-year-old America’s Cup trophy. Until Oracle’s win on Saturday, New Zealand had dominated the competition with superior tacking and upwind boatspeed. New Zealand trounced challengers from Italy and Sweden to gain the right to take on defending champion Oracle in the finals. The wind exceeded 20 knots (23 mph) for both races, hold just under the maximum allowed for Sunday’s competition, held on a crystal clear day on the Bay. A big crowd was on hand for the newly-competitive event, which the previous day drew 52,000 to viewing areas along the waterfront. Sunday’s wild racing was a vindication for America’s Cup organizers, led by software mogul Larry Ellison, whose decision to use extremely expensive and sometimes-dangerous high-tech catamarans for the competition has been widely criticized. A dearth of challengers, a cheating scandal, a fatal accident and many weeks of one-sided racing had threatened to make a mockery of the event. But the spectacle of the huge carbon-fiber boats hurtling across the Bay at 50 miles an hour in razor-tight races, with good shore viewing and sophisticated TV coverage, is exactly what organizers hoped would ultimately drive interest in the event. The competition is scheduled to continue with two races on Tuesday and, depending on the results, will continue on Wednesday and Thursday.

34,ORCL,Sailing-Drama builds as Oracle mounts comeback in America's Cup,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 15 (Reuters) - After months of accidents, controversies and one-sided racing, it took just one day for the America’s Cup sailing competition to get very interesting. Defending champion Oracle Team USA took the 8th race of the best-of-seventeen series on Saturday after challenger Emirates team New Zealand nearly capsized, ending a three-race losing streak and shifting the dynamic of a contest where New Zealand had once looked all but invincible. All eyes were on the wind speed as the two teams geared up for racing Sunday morning, with the breezes on San Francisco Bay nearing the first-race limit of 20.8 knots. A big crowd was expected for the newly-competitive event, which drew 52,000 to viewing areas along the Bay on Saturday. If the two Sunday races go off as scheduled, Oracle will be aiming to show that it’s newfound speed on the upwind leg of the course—where New Zealand has sealed easy victories until Saturday’s turnabout—was more than a fluke. New Zealand bounced back in the second race on Saturday, leading the contest by a narrow margin before it was called off for excessive winds. But a team that had been all but anointed the new Cup-holder on Friday now has something to prove. New Zealand has won six races and needs three more wins to take the Cup. Oracle, which was hit with a two-race penalty for illegal boat modifications in a preliminary regatta, has won twice but still needs nine victories to keep the 162-year-old trophy. The next races are on Tuesday and the regatta is scheduled to run through Saturday.

35,ORCL,Heavy wind forces pause in America's Cup showdown,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - High winds on San Francisco Bay forced a postponement of 34th America’s Cup sailing on Tuesday, delaying a potential final showdown between series leader Emirates Team New Zealand and defender Oracle Team USA. A seasonally strong out-flowing tide on San Francisco Bay running against incoming wind created conditions that exceeded safety limits set for the delicate 72-foot (22-meter) catamarans, organizers said. A proposal by Oracle to increase the wind limits for racing was rejected by New Zealand, a New Zealand spokesman said. Oracle’s performance over the weekend suggests its AC72 is faster than New Zealand’s in heavy winds, some observers believe. “We requested the wind speed to be increased by 1 knot. We feel the extra knot would still keep the event safe for the teams, and it would help avoid postponements like today and allow racing to continue as scheduled,” Oracle General Manager Grant Simmer said in an email. New Zealand had been in a position to clinch the Cup and end the regatta if it could have won both of Tuesday’s scheduled races. It will have another chance in two races scheduled for Wednesday, when the weather is expected to be more favorable. Tuesday’s racing was called after the boats headed out to the race course starting area near the Golden Gate Bridge, as whitecaps underneath grew frothier. Organizers set strict limits on wind speeds in the America’s Cup after Swedish team Artemis Racing suffered a fatal training accident in May. Wednesday’s upper limit was 20.1 knots (23 miles per hour) for race one. While 20-plus knot winds are not unusual on the bay and are acceptable for pleasure cruising, they are seen as too risky for the high-performance, hard-to-maneuver AC72 yachts. New Zealand dominated racing between the two teams in the first week of the America’s Cup finals but it ran into trouble over the weekend when a vastly improved Oracle won its second and third matches, interrupting the Kiwis’ momentum. Changes Oracle made to its AC72 catamaran after losing six of the first seven races in the series, combined with much-improved tacking upwind, have made the team quicker, with both crews now looking similarly polished in their maneuvers. “We put in a lot of effort in our days off to make the changes necessary to the boat and review our crew work,” Oracle grinder Shannon Falcone said on Sunday. “I feel really comfortable with where we are.” New Zealand leads the competition seven races to one, with Oracle’s first two wins having been negated by a cheating penalty before the finals began. The first team to score nine points will take home the 162-year-old America’s Cup trophy. Tuesday was not the first time weather interrupted the regatta. High winds forced organizers to call off Saturday’s second race while already in progress. After New Zealand narrowly avoided catastrophe on Saturday with a near-capsize that cost it the race, Sunday’s matches were among the most thrilling in yacht-racing history. The two supercharged AC72s dueled neck and neck in the second race, changing leads four times, an America’s Cup record, before New Zealand eked out a 17-second victory. “We keep a watchful eye on Oracle and we are impressed by the way they are sailing. We know we have to keep on improving,” New Zealand skipper Dean Barker said after Sunday’s mixed results. Until the weekend, New Zealand had dominated the competition with superior tacking and upwind speed.

38,ORCL,Oracle gives cautious outlook for second quarter,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) forecast sales and profit for its second quarter that fell short of expectations as it continues to battle soft global IT demand and smaller rivals focused on providing software over the Internet. Shares of the third largest software maker fell in after-hours trading on Wednesday. Oracle predicted that sales of new software and subscriptions - a closely watched determinant of future revenue - would be in a range of between down 4 percent and up 6 percent in its fiscal second quarter. It said it expects earnings per share, on a non-GAAP basis, of between 65 cents and 70 cents, compared with the average of analysts’ forecasts of 69 cents. The company forecast revenue growth of between 1 and 4 percent this quarter in constant dollars, translating to revenue of $9.02 billion to $9.29 billion and lagging the $9.41 billion Wall Street had expected. It also gave the revenue guidance in U.S. dollars, equivalent to a decline 1 percent or an increase of as much as 2 percent. The forecasts came on a conference call with executives after the company released first-quarter numbers on Wednesday that briefly buoyed the stock. Oracle reported higher first quarter earnings that beat estimates. Revenues rose 2 percent, but missed estimates. Oracle Chief Executive Officer Larry Ellison missed the call while his sailing team, Oracle Team USA, battled on San Francisco Bay to hold onto the America’s Cup. The New Zealand team won Wednesday’s match, leaving it just one race away from taking the trophy. Expectations had been muted after disappointing quarterly reports in March and June that led to sell offs in Oracle’s shares of almost 10 percent in both of the following trading sessions. In the past three months, the stock has partly recovered and is now up about 1 percent year-to-date. Smaller, aggressive companies are offering competitive software and Internet-based products at prices that often undercut Oracle, whose strategy is to integrate software with its own high-end, expensive hardware for greater efficiency. Still, many on Wall Street expect Oracle to eventually adapt to a more competitive and cloud-focused market. Ellison and his management team are known to excel in troubled times and Oracle has introduced its own offerings in the rapidly growing area. “The softer guide for November will be disappointing to those investors that were looking for a more positive outlook from Oracle,” said FBR analyst Daniel Ives. “The company has growth challenges ahead as they transition to the cloud and their guidance reflects that dynamic.” Barclays released a survey on Wednesday indicating that corporations expect flat spending on IT in the second half of 2013, down from expectations of a slight increase when the survey was last taken in April. The threat of a government shutdown next month in Washington, the most recent fiscal showdown between federal lawmakers, could potentially mute a pickup in enterprise tech spending. “There’s a lot of news out there, whether it’s coming from our own government or Europe. That influences what we put as a backdrop for our forecasts,” Catz said. Oracle said new software sales and Internet-based software subscriptions rose 4 percent to $1.7 billion in its fiscal first quarter which ended in August 31, in line with its own forecasts. Analysts on average had expected about $1.63 billion, Ives said. The company had forecast that new software sales and subscriptions would be unchanged or rise as much as 8 percent in the first quarter. Investors scrutinize new software sales because they generate high-margin, long-term maintenance contracts and are an important indicator of future profit. Oracle said overall revenue rose 2 percent to $8.37 billion in the first quarter. That was a little below the $8.479 billion analysts had expected on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income rose to $2.19 billion, or 47 cents per share, from $2.03 billion, or 41 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. On an adjusted basis, Oracle earned 59 cents per share. Analysts expected first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 56 cents, down from an average estimate of 58 cents two months ago. Revenue from Oracle’s hardware systems products, which it acquired through the $5.6 billion purchase of Sun Microsystems in 2010, fell 14 percent to $669 million. Oracle had forecast that hardware product revenue for the August quarter would decline as much as 6 percent or grow as much as 2 percent.

40,ORCL,New Zealand on cusp of America's Cup victory,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Emirates Team New Zealand on Wednesday edged to within one win of taking home the America’s Cup, defeating Oracle Team USA in a close-fought race that again showcased the Kiwis’ seamless teamwork and superior strategy at the start. But New Zealand will have to wait at least another day to clinch the Cup after Wednesday’s second race was postponed seconds before the starting gun due to high winds, the second straight day that a strong sea breeze and outgoing tide combined to make conditions on San Francisco Bay unsafe for the fragile 72-foot catamarans. In the race that did take place, New Zealand turned in a textbook performance that left defender Oracle with nowhere to turn. Oracle, once the favorite to retain the title that it won three years ago, still needs eight victories to hold on to the trophy. New Zealand won the start and never trailed, crossing the finish line 15 seconds ahead of the Cup defender, although Oracle closed the gap briefly on the crucial upwind leg before losing ground again with a poor tacking maneuver. “Every win is so hard. You’re thankful for every win you get,” said New Zealand skipper Dean Barker. “You have two boats that are pretty even in performance.” New Zealand dominated matches between the two teams in the first week of the America’s Cup finals on San Francisco Bay, then lost momentum over the weekend when a vastly improved Oracle won its second and third matches, raising hopes of a last-minute comeback. Oracle, which lost six of the first seven races in the series, became far more competitive after making changes to its twin-hulled AC72 and has greatly improved its upwind tacking. But Oracle’s new-found speed appears most pronounced in heavier winds, and the breezes were comparatively light in Wednesday’s race, averaging 15 knots (17 mph). On Tuesday, both races were canceled. Organizers set the limits on wind speeds after Swedish team Artemis Racing suffered a fatal training accident in May. A proposal by Oracle this week to increase the wind limits for racing was rejected by New Zealand. Sunday’s matches were among the most thrilling in yacht-racing history.

42,ORCL,Sailing-New Zealand gets fresh shot to wrest America's Cup from Oracle,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Emirates Team New Zealand gets a fresh opportunity to capture the America’s Cup from Oracle Team USA on Wednesday after high winds scuppered the previous day’s racing. The America’s Cup could be decided if the Kiwi challengers win both races. New Zealand dominated matches between the two teams in the first week of the America’s Cup finals on San Francisco Bay, then lost momentum over the weekend when a vastly improved Oracle won its second and third matches, raising hopes of a last-minute comeback. The New Zealanders lead the competition seven races to one, with Oracle’s first two wins having been negated by a cheating penalty before the finals began. The first team to score nine points will take home the 162-year-old America’s Cup trophy. Oracle, which lost six of the first seven races in the series, is faster since making changes to its twin-hulled AC72 and has greatly improved its upwind tacking. Both crews now execute polished high-speed maneuvers when zigzagging across the bay. Tuesday’s scheduled races were canceled after a seasonally strong out-flowing tide and high winds created conditions that exceeded safety limits set for the delicate 72-foot catamarans. Organizers set the limits on wind speeds in the America’s Cup after Swedish team Artemis Racing suffered a fatal training accident in May. Tuesday was not the first time weather interrupted the regatta. High winds forced organizers to call off Saturday’s second race while already in progress. A proposal by Oracle this week to increase the wind limits for racing was rejected by New Zealand. Many observers believe Oracle’s performance over the weekend shows its AC72 is faster than New Zealand’s in heavy winds. Sunday’s matches were among the most thrilling in yacht-racing history. The two supercharged AC72s dueled neck and neck in the second race, changing leads four times, an America’s Cup record, before New Zealand eked out a victory. On Saturday, New Zealand narrowly avoided catastrophe with a near-capsize that could have cost it the race. The recent wild racing has been a vindication for America’s Cup organizers, led by software mogul Larry Ellison, whose decision to use extremely expensive and sometimes-dangerous high-tech catamarans for the competition has been widely criticized. When Ellison’s team won the America’s Cup in Valencia, Spain in 2010, it gained the right to set the rules and chose windy San Francisco Bay for this year’s competition. The Kiwis first won the America’s Cup in 1995 and successfully defended it in 2000 before losing the trophy three years later to Swiss biotechnology billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli’s Alinghi in a disastrous campaign that left the team in shambles.

43,ORCL,UPDATE 2-Sailing-U.S. boat stays alive in America's Cup,"By Jonathan Weber SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Oracle Team USA stayed alive in the America’s Cup sailing regatta on Thursday, taking the first of the day’s two scheduled races by a comfortable 31-second margin and preventing Emirates Team New Zealand from closing out the competition. The second race was canceled after the wind exceeded the limits, which has become a familiar pattern resulting largely from a decision earlier this summer to lower the wind limits following a fatal training accident. In the race that did take place, Oracle won the start with a shrewd maneuver that pushed New Zealand away from the line, and then showed impressive speed on the critical upwind leg before dashing home for the victory. New Zealand has mostly dominated the best-of-17 finals series and now holds an eight to two lead. “We know the nation is watching us, but once you get into the start box you don’t really think about that,” said Grant Dalton, managing director of the New Zealand team and a grinder on their 72-foot catamaran. The Kiwis turned in the latest of several textbook performances in moving to the brink of victory on Wednesday, and seemed to have beaten back an Oracle revival that saw the U.S. boat win two thrilling races over the weekend. But Thursday’s first race suggested the momentum could be shifting once again as Oracle showed the speed, tactics and boat handling it needs to match the polished Kiwi team. “We have to finish this thing,” said Ben Gordon, a 36 year old New Zealander who lives in San Francisco. “The boat’s are dead even and it’s getting a bit dodgy.” Wednesday’s second race was also canceled due to a strong breeze and outgoing tide. The AC72 catamarans can attain speeds of up to 50 miles per hour, but are hard to control and potentially subject to capsize and equipment failure in high winds. Sweden’s Artemis Racing suffered a disastrous accident in May, when its boat broke apart and capsized, killing British Olympian Andrew “Bart” Simpson. That incident, which came after an Oracle boat capsized late last year, prompted a series of rule changes including a substantial decrease in the wind limits. Ellison’s team won the America’s Cup in Valencia, Spain in 2010 and with it the right to set the rules for this year’s competition, including choosing to race on the AC72s and to hold the regatta on windy San Francisco Bay. The Kiwis first won the America’s Cup in 1995 and successfully defended it in 2000 before losing the trophy three years later to Swiss biotechnology billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli’s Alinghi in a disastrous campaign that left the team in shambles.

47,ORCL,New Zealand a race away from taking America's Cup from Oracle,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Emirates Team New Zealand is on the verge of winning the America’s Cup and needs to beat struggling defender Oracle Team USA in just one of two races scheduled for Thursday. The Kiwis turned in the latest of several textbook performances in a race on Wednesday that left Oracle with nowhere to turn. Oracle, once the favorite to retain the title that it won three years ago, needs eight straight victories to keep the huge silver cup, which at 162 years is the sporting world’s oldest trophy. New Zealand was forced to wait for a final crack at the Cup after a second race scheduled for Wednesday was canceled due to a strong sea breeze and outgoing tide that made conditions on San Francisco Bay unsafe for the high-performance but fragile 72-foot catamarans. “We are obviously in a very difficult position,” Oracle tactician Ben Ainslie said. “We’ll keep working on what improvements we can make, and we will go out, get the guys fired up and race as hard as we can.” New Zealand dominated matches between the two teams in early races in the America’s Cup finals on San Francisco Bay, then lost momentum over the weekend when a vastly improved Oracle won its second and third matches, raising hopes of a last-minute comeback. Oracle Team USA, which is backed by software billionaire Larry Ellison, became far more competitive after making changes to its carbon fiber AC72 and has greatly improved its upwind tacking, but it may be to be too little and too late. “Both teams have reacted very well to what they’ve observed of the other team,” New Zealand skipper Dean Barker said after Wednesday’s matchup. “It’s quite unbelievable that the two boats are so close in performance across a wide range of conditions.” Oracle’s new-found speed appears most pronounced in heavier winds, and the breezes were comparatively light in Wednesday’s race, averaging 15 knots (17 mph). Thursday’s forecast was for winds between 15 knots and 18 knots, according to organizers, below limits they set after Swedish team Artemis Racing suffered a fatal training accident in May. A proposal by Oracle this week to increase the wind limits for racing was rejected by New Zealand. Sunday’s matches were among the most thrilling in yacht-racing history. The two supercharged AC72s dueled neck and neck in the second race, changing leads four times, an America’s Cup record, before New Zealand eked out a victory. On Saturday, New Zealand narrowly avoided catastrophe with a near-capsize that cost it the race. Ellison’s team won the America’s Cup in Valencia, Spain in 2010 and with it the right to set the rules for this year’s competition, including the AC72 yachts and the regatta’s venue on windy San Francisco Bay. The Kiwis first won the America’s Cup in 1995 and successfully defended it in 2000 before losing the trophy three years later to Swiss biotechnology billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli’s Alinghi in a disastrous campaign that left the team in shambles.

51,ORCL,UPDATE 2-Sailing-America's Cup showdown postponed due to weather,"* Wrong wind direction derails Saturday’s races * New Zealand one win away from taking Cup from Oracle By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Fluky weather prevented America’s Cup racing on Saturday, extending at least one more day a regatta that Emirates Team New Zealand a week ago appeared to have all but won against defender Oracle Team USA. After struggling for much of the regatta’s final series in San Francisco, the team owned by Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison has gained momentum against Emirates Team New Zealand, refusing since Thursday to let the Kiwis win the one race that would give them the trophy. The finals, which began Sept. 7, will now run longer than the two weeks regatta organizers had planned for. Uncooperative weather conditions on San Francisco Bay have wreaked havoc on the race schedule all week. On Saturday, a southerly wind direction forced organizers to call off both scheduled races. The race course is set up for the Bay’s dependable westerly sea breeze. Oracle staved off elimination on Friday, catching a huge break when the day’s first race suffered from a lack of wind and was abandoned for exceeding the time limit, with New Zealand far ahead. Oracle then came back to win a second race in stronger breezes. “Luck is a great thing. Luck beats skill every time,” New Zealand’s frustrated tactician Ray Davies later told reporters. That victory trimmed New Zealand’s advantage in the best-of-17 series to 8-3. Racing is scheduled to resume Sunday and continue every day until there is a winner. Until Friday the regatta had been dogged by winds that often exceeded the limits set by the organizers, which were lowered for safety reasons after a sailor died when one of the 72-foot America’s Cup catamarans capsized during practice in May. The wind-limit rule forced five race cancellations since the America’s Cup finals began two weeks ago, and the two teams have bickered about raising the threshold. The Kiwis dominated the early matches of the final series and appeared poised to easily reclaim the trophy they lost in 2003. But Oracle has succeeded in shifting the momentum with boat changes and improved tacking, and the two teams now appear remarkably even. “We’re in a battle now. Honestly, we both want to kill each other, but that’s sport,” Oracle skipper Jimmy Spithill said of rival skipper Dean Barker, the two sitting beside each other at a post-race press conference. “At match point, it’s almost like we get the best out of our boys when they’re under pressure,” Spithill said. Following alterations it made to its AC72 catamaran, Oracle is now seen as having a slight advantage over the Kiwi boat in strong winds. Oracle sent a letter this week to the New Zealand team suggesting the wind limits be increased in order to avoid more delays, a proposal the Kiwis flatly rejected.

52,ORCL,Sailing-Oracle and New Zealand in bitter America's Cup battle,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Emirates Team New Zealand’s America’s Cup campaign that a week ago looked all but won has turned into a bitter battle against Oracle Team USA, which has repeatedly denied the Kiwis the final point they need.

Ellison’s team won the America’s Cup in Valencia, Spain in 2010 and with it the right to set the rules for this year’s competition, including choosing to race on the AC72s and to hold the regatta on windy San Francisco Bay. The Kiwis first won the America’s Cup in 1995 and successfully defended it in 2000 before losing the trophy three years later to Swiss biotechnology billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli’s Alinghi in a disastrous campaign that left the team in shambles.",9212013,http://www.reuters.com/article/sailing-americascup/sailing-oracle-and-new-zealand-in-bitter-americas-cup-battle-idUSL2N0HG26P20130921
53,ORCL,"Oracle refuses to surrender America's Cup, Kiwis struggle","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A formidable Oracle Team USA is making an America’s Cup comeback against Emirates Team New Zealand that last week looked all but impossible. The team owned by software billionaire Larry Ellison won Sunday’s two scheduled races on San Francisco Bay, refusing to give up the one final victory that the Kiwis need to take the Cup home. With momentum clearly on its side, Oracle now needs to win another four races against New Zealand, which has lost four in a row since its last victory on Wednesday. In Sunday’s first race, Oracle had the edge at the starting gun, then pushed New Zealand toward the course boundary line before rounding the first mark. It used this advantageous position to open a lead that the Kiwis were unable to close, despite closing to within a boat length on the third leg. With both teams struggling to find wind on San Francisco Bay, Oracle finished 23 second ahead in the relatively slow race. In the day’s second matchup, New Zealand continued to struggle to outmaneuver the increasingly agile Oracle team. New Zealand dominated the early matches of the final, which began September 7, and appeared poised to easily reclaim the trophy they lost in 2003. But Oracle has made changes to its boat and improved its teamwork, and now the two teams now appear remarkably even. “We are going to get more out of the old girl,” said Oracle skipper Jimmy Spithill. “We worked very, very hard last night and found some extra wheels.” New Zealand’s point advantage over Oracle has fallen to 8-5 in the best-of-17 series. Last Wednesday, Oracle had just one point. Racing is scheduled to continue on Monday and every day until there is a winner. Uncooperative weather conditions on the bay wreaked havoc on the race schedule last week and most recently forced the postponement of two races scheduled for Saturday.

55,ORCL,Sailing-America's Cup set to resume with better weather,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 22 (Reuters) - America’s Cup racing is set to resume on Sunday with Emirates Team New Zealand just one race short of claiming the trophy from Oracle Team USA. After struggling for much of the regatta’s final series in San Francisco, the team owned by Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison has gained momentum against Emirates Team New Zealand, refusing since Thursday to let the Kiwis win the one race that would give them the trophy. Uncooperative weather conditions on San Francisco Bay wreaked havoc on the race schedule last week and most recently forced the postponement of two races scheduled for Saturday. Organizers said they expect the wind to start light and build through the afternoon for Sunday’s two planned races, reaching about 20 knots (23 mph), which would be under the wind limits that have halted racing several times during the regatta. But a new potential wrinkle surfaced Saturday night when a whale was spotted in San Francisco Bay. Regatta director Ian Murray said helicopters were monitoring the racing area for sea life that could disrupt racing. “I think people are fed up with time limits, wind limits and  whale limits and want to move on,” he said. The Kiwis dominated the early matches of the final, which began Sept. 7, and appeared poised to easily reclaim the trophy they lost in 2003. But Oracle has succeeded in shifting the momentum with boat changes and improved tacking, and the two teams now appear remarkably even. In the best-of-17 series, New Zealand has an 8-3 advantage over Oracle.

56,ORCL,Larry Ellison juggles America's Cup and Oracle customer expo,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The 34th America’s Cup underway on San Francisco Bay is going on longer than Oracle Team USA backer Larry Ellison expected and is now overlapping with his software company’s massive annual customer conference. America’s Cup sailing is a major passion for Ellison, rivaled only by his focus on expanding what is already the world’s third largest software maker. The next match-ups for Ellison’s team in the America’s Cup, which could easily be the final ones in the regatta, are set for Tuesday at roughly the same time he is scheduled to give a major keynote at Oracle OpenWorld, which kicked off on Sunday at San Francisco’s main convention center. Oracle Team USA won its fifth straight race on Monday, denying Emirates Team New Zealand the final victory it needs in order to claim the Cup, which organizers originally thought would be settled by last Saturday at the latest. With over 60,000 people registered, this year’s OpenWorld conference is a major opportunity for the Ellison to pitch Oracle’s strategy on cloud computing and other technology designed for companies and governments. Ellison’s main keynote is always a focal point of the event, an opportunity he often uses to attack rival companies and colorfully criticize their products to the delight of attendees. A spokeswoman declined to say whether Oracle will reschedule Ellison’s Tuesday speech. On Sunday, hours before opening Oracle OpenWorld with a speech in which he debuted new high-end data center technology, Ellison was out on the Bay as his team beat Emirates Team New Zealand in two races. Ellison also met with a few of the Oracle crew members on Sunday evening, according to Oracle skipper Jimmy Spithill. “He’s really excited, obviously. I bet he wishes he was out on the boat racing because he’s just a natural competitor,” Spithill told reporters. “On the other side, he’s obviously a very busy man running a business.” Last week, Ellison was absent from Oracle’s quarterly earnings conference call with analysts so that he could be close to the racing, which the sailing enthusiast has been viewing from a team speedboat. OpenWorld attendees are likely to be forgiving if Ellison reschedules his Tuesday speech. “As long as customers can hear from Larry and he can talk through his vision at Oracle OpenWorld, that’s the focal point,” said FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives. “It’s what comes out of his mouth rather than the timing of when it comes out.” Oracle’s sponsorship of the America’s Cup team gives the company a major marketing opportunity it regularly leverages at OpenWorld. Oracle President Mark Hurd kicked off his keynote on Monday with an action-packed video of Oracle Team USA racing their high-tech AC72 catamaran, with captions including “Extreme Performance” and “Powered by Oracle.” He also led attendees, many of them IT employees at Fortune 500 companies, in a cheer to support the team. Reporters who have been in San Francisco covering the America’s Cup for the past few weeks had trouble on Sunday and Monday extending their hotel stays because rooms have been sold out to tens of thousands of Oracle OpenWorld visitors.

58,ORCL,Powerful Oracle moves a step closer to keeping America's Cup,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oracle Team USA moved a step closer to keeping the America’s Cup on Monday, winning the day’s only race and yet again preventing challenger Emirates Team New Zealand from clinching the trophy. It was the fifth straight victory for the team owned by billionaire Larry Ellison, which a week ago seemed like it was about to lose the world’s oldest sporting trophy but now looks strong enough to win the series - as long as it can keep the Kiwis from winning one more race. New Zealand appeared to have the advantage at the starting gun, crossing the line slightly ahead. But Oracle was quicker to rise up on its foils and accelerate, passing the Kiwis to windward and preventing them from getting a right-of-way blocking position at mark one. New Zealand never recovered, despite hoisting a second, larger jib hoping for more downwind speed, and finished 33 seconds behind the agile U.S. boat. “We were relatively happy with where we were on the line but they managed to get a bit of momentum at the start. A little bit frustrating,” said New Zealand skipper Dean Barker. “The Oracle guys had a polished race that time and there were no opportunities to get back into it.” Weak wind delayed the start of the race on Monday and not enough time was left for a second scheduled race. Two more races are scheduled for Tuesday. After struggling to keep up with New Zealand in the early matches of the final series, Oracle made changes to its AC72 catamaran and improved its execution of maneuvers. It’s newly found competitiveness has set the stage for a historic comeback. New Zealand’s point advantage over Oracle has fallen to 8-6 in the best-of-17 series. Oracle now needs to win three straight races to keep the Cup, while New Zealand needs just one to take it home. On the water, Oracle has won eight races, the same as New Zealand, but its first two wins were negated by a cheating penalty before the finals began. Too much wind, too little wind, and wind from the wrong direction have forced organizers to postpone several races since the series began on Sept 7. On Saturday, the Kiwis were well on their way to winning one last match, and the Cup. But with both teams struggling to find enough wind, that race was called off after a time limit was exceeded.

With two match victories on Sunday, the team owned by software billionaire Larry Ellison has now won four in a row, refusing to give up the one final race that the Kiwis need to take the Cup home. Uncooperative weather conditions on the bay have wreaked havoc on the America’s Cup race schedule and could prevent more racing on Monday. “The forecast is essentially light and variable, magnificent for water skiing,” said regatta director Iain Murray. “It’s a promising day, just a matter of whether it gets going early enough.” After struggling to keep up with New Zealand in the early matches of the final series, Oracle made changes to its AC72 catamaran and improved crew execution.

61,ORCL,U.S. boat pulls even in historic America's Cup comeback,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oracle Team USA won two more races against Emirates Team New Zealand to even up the America’s Cup finals on Tuesday, continuing an epic comeback in a regatta that once looked like a Kiwi cakewalk and will now be decided by a single winner-take-all showdown. The deciding race in what will be the longest America’s Cup in its 162-year history is scheduled for Wednesday. The stunning recovery for the team backed by Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison continued on every front in perfect sailing conditions Tuesday. The U.S. boat came from behind to win the second race easily and has now has seven straight victories, another Cup milestone. New Zealand dominated that start for the first time in recent races, but then committed several tactical errors and Oracle stormed to a lead of nearly a minute at the finish. In the first race the reeling Kiwi team drew a double-penalty as the two boats crossed the starting line, which allowed Oracle to jump to an insurmountable lead. New Zealand once led the competition 8-1, and numerous Kiwi fans in San Francisco and back home in New Zealand were ready to celebrate victory in a grueling two-year-long Cup campaign. The New Zealand government contributed about $30 million to the effort to bring the Cup back to the sailing-crazed nation. But boat improvements, superior tactics and sharper sailing by Oracle have turned its fortunes around, evidenced in the second race Tuesday when the team appeared to show more speed on every leg of the race. “We’ve been doing a lot of work at night with design engineering technicians,” Oracle skipper Jimmy Spithill said after the first race. “The boat is just going faster and faster and the boys are really starting to believe.” New Zealand skipper Dean Barker acknowledged in comments after the races that Oracle was now faster on the upwind legs in heavier winds. New Zealand pioneered the so-called “foiling” in which the big boats lift almost completely out of the water and sail on small horizontal wings attached to their daggerboards and rudders, but Oracle is now doing it more effectively on the critical upwind leg. “It’s the first time we’ve seen conditions where we were not as good as we needed to be,” said Barker. Spithill had put on a brave face through the early losses, insisting that the event was “far from over” even when his team needed an implausible nine straight wins to keep the oldest trophy in sports. His bravado, backed by consistently shrewd maneuvers at the start, has now been vindicated. “There’s a huge wave of momentum we’ve been riding and it just builds and builds and builds,” Spithill said after Tuesday’s victories. Barker sailed nearly flawlessly for much the summer as the Kiwis trounced Italian and Swedish challengers for the right to race Oracle. His dominance continued in the early races of the final as the Kiwis showed better speed upwind and much smoother tacking. But the team has appeared to come apart in the face of the Oracle comeback and a run of bad luck that saw two races in which it was leading called off due to wind conditions. The start of Tuesday’s first race featured classic match-racing drama. New Zealand miscalculated and bumped Oracle, which had the right of way, as it maneuvered to block its rival on the approach to the line. The two 72-foot catamarans made contact again as they drifted across the line. A second foul was called on the Kiwis, which had stopped dead in the water as Oracle sped off to a large lead around the first mark. New Zealand used textbook starting tactics in race two to get a solid lead around the first mark. But Oracle gained ground going downwind, and, after New Zealand mistimed a tack as the boats converged on the upwind leg, foiled past the Kiwis to open a big lead. The regatta was supposed to be over on Saturday, but racing has been postponed several times for too much wind, not enough wind and wind from the wrong direction, dragging the event out into a third week. Rule changes lowered the wind limits after the Swedish team suffered a fatal training accident in May. A two-race penalty against Oracle for illegal boat modifications in a preliminary regatta has also lengthened the competition. Oracle has actually won 10 races on the water, but only 8 of them count. New Zealand yachting fans are now left to wonder whether Barker and his team can take a page from Oracle’s book and find a way to win with their backs to the wall. “I’m struggling to keep positive. My faith in the team and Dean is being sorely tested. We’re only one (win) away, but my nerves are a bit like our chances, in tatters,” said Wellington office worker Will Christie.

In the past, Ellison has used his OpenWorld keynote to attack rival companies and colorfully criticize their products to the delight of attendees. At least a few of the more than 60,000 people registered to attend this year’s OpenWorld were disappointed by Ellison’s absence. “I can understand his dedication to the racing, but it does send an interesting message to the audience here about his priorities,” said Mason McDaniel, whose company spent a few thousand dollars in travel expenses to send him from Washington, D.C., to OpenWorld, one of San Francisco’s biggest tech conferences.

At least a few of the more than 60,000 people registered to attend this year’s OpenWorld were disappointed by Ellison’s absence. “I can understand his dedication to the racing, but it does send an interesting message to the audience here about his priorities,” said Mason McDaniel, whose company spent a few thousand dollars in travel expenses to send him from Washington, D.C., to OpenWorld, one of San Francisco’s biggest tech conferences. Oracle Team USA won its seventh straight race on Tuesday and looked set to keep the Cup from rival Emirates Team New Zealand. The Cup, which has gone on longer than expected due to unfavorable weather, will go to whichever team wins the next race, scheduled for Wednesday.

66,ORCL,Sailing-New Zealand losing streak has fans fearing the worst,"WELLINGTON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - New Zealand yachting fans, who just a week ago were about to pop the champagne corks to celebrate the winning of the America’s Cup, are starting to fear the worst after the defender Oracle Team USA notched a fifth successive win to dent challenger Emirates Team New Zealand’s chances of clinching the trophy. Thousands have gathered to watch races in yacht clubs, public and school halls, and around television sets in bars, cafes, and work places to watch the races, which take place at the start of each day. Spectators, fingers crossed in hope, feet clad in red socks - a lucky totem from the country’s first successful challenge in 1995 — have had their emotions roiled by every wind change, tacking duel, and weather delay. A week ago, sport’s oldest trophy, known as the Auld Mug, looked destined to return to New Zealand as the challenger, skippered by Dean Barker, sprinted to an 8-1 lead, but Oracle’s return has New Zealand fans starting to think the unthinkable. “I’m struggling to keep positive, my faith in the team and Dean (Barker) is being sorely tested, we’re only one (win) away, but my nerves are a bit like our chances, in tatters,” said Wellington office worker Will Christie, who has been late into work so he can watch the maritime drama. In a nation of 4.5 million, where it’s estimated there’s one boat for every four people, there is no shortage of either experience or advice. “Team New Zealand can still do it, but they have to look at being much more aggressive at the start ... sitting there on match point I think they have to lash out with a bit of aggression,” said Geoff Herd, the commodore of Wellington’s Royal Port Nicholson yacht Club. The test of faith is being reflected in betting on the races, as local punters see the chances of an upset. The state-controlled betting agency, TAB, has slashed the odds of Oracle holding on to the Cup from rank outsider to still unfancied but in with a serious chance. “The money just keeps on coming, Oracle have five wins in a row and that can’t be ignored, at one stage we closed the book but when Oracle came back we couldn’t ignore it,” the TAB’s yachting bookmaker Kieran McAnulty told Reuters. The irony is that Sailing New Zealand, the national body which controls the sport, gets a slice of the betting proceeds and will get a bigger amount because of Oracle’s resurgence.

67,ORCL,"Capping an epic comeback, Oracle wins the America's Cup","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oracle Team USA prevailed in a dramatic winner-take-all showdown with Emirates Team New Zealand on Wednesday to win the 34th America’s Cup, completing a stirring comeback that helped make the once-troubled event among the most exciting in sailing history. For Oracle and its hard-charging skipper, Australian Jimmy Spithill, the win was an extraordinary sporting triumph, one that saw the team climb back from a seemingly insurmountable 8-1 deficit in the best-of-17 series to keep the trophy it won three years ago. The thrilling final races were also a ringing vindication of Oracle owner Larry Ellison’s controversial decision to transform a once-staid yachting event into a TV-friendly, extreme-sports spectacle featuring huge high-speed catamarans that might draw a new generation of enthusiasts to sailing. Emirates Team New Zealand, a plucky challenger that lacked a billionaire sponsor but nonetheless sailed to the brink of Cup victory, must now endure the ignominy of having let the prize slip from its grasp after a grueling two-year campaign of boat development and training that unfolded almost exactly as planned until the final days. Oracle dominated the last race, showcasing the dramatic improvement in boat speed on the upwind leg of the race that began to emerge a week ago. Oracle seemed to find an extra gear after losing most of the early races, and even overcame a pre-match penalty that required it win 11 races on the water. “On your own you’re nothing, but with a team like this around you, they can make you look great,” Spithill said after the race. Just a week ago, New Zealand fans had all but begun celebrating what seemed like an inevitable sporting and economic windfall for the longtime international sailing power, which supported the team with about $30 million in government funds in the hopes of bringing the trophy - and attendant tourism and publicity - back home. But on Wednesday it was Ellison who was celebrating, joining the crew on the boat for a champagne shower in the moments after the finish. Fans who flocked to the San Francisco bayfront by the tens of thousands for the final races were treated to a little bit of everything: tense on-the-water duels, a near-capsize, winds that were alternately too light and too strong, and even a whale that threatened to disrupt racing. Until just a few weeks ago, the summer-long series of America’s Cup events looked like a monumental bust. A British Olympic champion sailing for the Swedish team was killed in a training accident in May, calling the safety of the boats into question and forcing contentious rule changes. New Zealand completely dominated the Louis Vuitton challenger series, which featured only three competitors and saw some “races” with only one boat charging around the course. A cheating scandal erupted, with Oracle ultimately being docked two races and losing a key crew member as punishment for illegal boat modifications in a preliminary series. In San Francisco, many locals bristled at city support for what has often been derided as a rich man’s yacht race. Controversies aside, Oracle seemed to have a competitive edge early on, with the home-team advantage and enough money to hire top sailors and build two equally matched boats to train against one another. Its team was distinctly international, with New Zealander Russel Coutts, who led the Kiwis to Cup victory in 1995 and 2000, serving as CEO and Spithill as the skipper. Only one American was among the Oracle crew at the finish. When only three challengers proved willing to take on the cost and complexity of the 72-foot carbon fiber yachts, Oracle’s chances looked even better - though it faced criticism that the dearth of competitors had made hosting the event a bad financial deal for San Francisco. But the Kiwis, led by a 56-year-old managing director, Grant Dalton, who doubled as a workhorse on-board “grinder” during races, proved ingenious in developing their boat, particularly in pioneering the use of hydrofoils that lift both hulls almost entirely of the water to reduce drag. Skipper Dean Barker steered nearly flawless races through most of the competition as New Zealand first crushed the Italian team, Luna Rossa, in the challenger series, and then dominated Oracle in the early races of the Cup finals. But now the America’s Cup, with its rich history of dueling tycoons, gamesmanship and cutting-edge boat technology, appears firmly headed in Ellison’s innovative direction. Not since Australia ended the United States’ 132-year-long grip on the oldest trophy in sports in 1983 has the competition taken such a sharp turn.

69,ORCL,RPT-Sailing-Epic America's Cup to end with winner-take-all showdown,"By Jonathan Weber SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 25 (Reuters) - The 34th America’s Cup, which until a few weeks ago had looked like an economic and sporting fiasco, is set to end Wednesday with a high-speed, half hour, winner-take-all sailboat race between Oracle Team USA and Emirates Team New Zealand. The unlikely climax comes after the Kiwi team opened up a seemingly insurmountable 8-1 lead in the final best-of-17 match-race series, then crumbled as Oracle won seven in a row to stand on the brink of one of the greatest comebacks in sports history. “The exciting thing for me is seeing how this team has gelled together,” said Oracle skipper Jimmy Spithill after winning both races on Tuesday to tie things up with New Zealand. “Sometimes you need to face that barrel of the gun to come together. You can get wobbly in the knees or you can look into the barrel. Every day we’ve managed to step it up more.” The thrilling on-the-water action over the past two weeks, with 72-foot catamarans flying across San Francisco Bay at speeds reaching 50 miles-per-hour, has largely vindicated the controversial decision to use big, high-tech boats in the competition for the oldest trophy in sports. Never has the America’s Cup lasted so long or produced so many dramatic twists and turns, ranging from a fatal training accident that once threatened to scupper the competition altogether to a cheating scandal that forced Oracle to begin the final series two races in the hole. Were it not for the penalty, Oracle would have clinched the Cup on Tuesday. A week ago, New Zealand fans had all but begun celebrating what seemed like an inevitable sporting and economic triumph for the sailing-crazed nation, which supported the team with about $30 million in government funds in the hopes of bringing the trophy - and attendant tourism and publicity - back home. Oracle and its owner, Larry Ellison, were facing a humiliating defeat in a competition that it had radically reshaped after winning the Cup in 2010. Ellison and his team led by New Zealander Russell Coutts, who was responsible for the Kiwi’s Cup victories in 1995 and 2000, developed a new type of sailing event featuring the super-fast boats, state-of-the-art television coverage and scenic viewing areas along San Francisco Bay, all aimed at making sailing appealing to a wide audience. With the home-team advantage and enough money to hire top sailors and build two equally matched boats to train against one another, Oracle was the presumptive favorite from the start. When only three challengers proved willing to take on the cost and complexity of the 72-foot carbon fiber yachts, Oracle’s chances looked even better—though it faced criticism that the dearth of competitors had made hosting the event a bad financial deal for San Francisco. But the Kiwis, led by a 56-year-old managing director, Grant Dalton, who doubled as a workhorse onboard “grinder” during races, proved ingenious in developing their boat, particularly in pioneering the use of hydrofoils that lift both hulls almost entirely of the water to reduce drag. Skipper Dean Barker steered nearly flawless races through most of the competition as New Zealand first crushed the Italian team, Luna Rossa, in the Louis Vuitton challenger series, and then dominated Oracle in the early races of the Cup finals. “We’re going to prepare as we have been and we have confidence we can win this,” Barker said late Tuesday. “No one’s slightly head down or lacking in confidence. We know if we put the pieces together we’ll be successful.” Oracle started two races behind as a punishment for illegal boat modifications in a preliminary regatta and its first-string wing trimmer was suspended for his involvement in that incident. But to the astonishment of veteran America’s Cup observers, Oracle turned the tables. It replaced its tactician with Olympic champion Ben Ainslie, made changes to its boat that gave it more upwind speed and showed vastly improved tacking and teamwork as the racing progressed. Event organizers barely contained their glee as the competition transformed from a display of bumbling that might keep yachting from becoming a major spectator sport into a tense, see-saw competition that showcased sailing’s athleticism, tactical judgments and innovative design. More then one million spectators have passed through the two America’s Cup compounds on the waterfront. Fans watching from the shore - or following state-of-the-art television coverage - have been treated to a little bit of everything: tense on-the-water duels, a near-capsize, repeated delays due to wind conditions, and even a whale that threatened to disrupt racing. The TV coverage has itself been a triumph. Three helicopters and two speedboats equipped with motion-stabilizing equipment and have delivered gripping pictures, enhanced by sophisticated video graphics that helped make sense of it all for millions of viewers around the world. Each AC72 was equipped with multiple waterproof cameras and microphones to capture the action of the crew and the rush and spray of seawater. For the city of San Francisco, where many residents have questioned the value of subsidizing what some deride as a rich man’s yacht race, the exciting regatta may also shift the dynamics. There’s no guarantee that Ellison would choose to host the event in San Francisco again should his team complete its comeback win. But if he does, he may get a warmer welcome.

71,ORCL,"Team NZ must shed 'scar tissue', says Bertrand","MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Emirates Team New Zealand face a huge challenge to deny Oracle Team USA a miracle comeback in Wednesday’s winner-takes-all showdown, but can still win if they forget their “scar tissue”, says former America’s Cup-winning skipper John Bertrand. Oracle won two more races on Tuesday to extend their streak to seven, frustrating a sailing-mad nation of 4.5 million who thought sport’s oldest trophy secured after New Zealand had earlier stormed to an 8-1 lead. Bertrand, whose Australia II yacht ended 132 years of American dominance by winning the 1983 challenge, said New Zealand had done little wrong out on the water, but had unquestionably been trumped in the technical race. “Oracle team USA have come on strong from a technical point of view and from a sailing point of view,” Bertrand told Reuters in a phone interview. “They’ve made some very, very excellent decisions over the last 10 days. They’ve updated and the boat’s basically increasing speed. “There is a speed differential. There’s no question about it, but part of it is definitely tactics as well out on the water, make the right calls at the right time. “The interesting thing about sport is that the slate is clean. If the Kiwis go in, learn from what they’ve done so far and the mistakes they’ve made and then just clear the brain and just get on with tomorrow’s race with no scar tissue — that’s their big challenge. “If they can do that, then they can actually still win it.” After Tuesday’s victories, Oracle’s Australian skipper Jimmy Spithill said his team were riding “a huge wave of momentum” which was getting “bigger and bigger”. Bertrand, 66, is well aware of the power of momentum, having steered Australia II with its famed winged keel to an emotional 4-3 victory over the Dennis Conner-skippered Liberty, after initially trailing the regatta 3-1. Like Australia II’s crew, Oracle had successfully dismissed “the consequences of winning or losing” from their minds and just got on with the next race, Bertrand said. Bringing in British Olympic hero Ben Ainslie as tactician had also proved a masterstroke. “With Tom Slingsby as strategist, that combination is absolutely world best,” Bertrand said, referring to the Australian sailor who won gold in the laser class at London Games. “You’ve got some incredible brain power combined with Jimmy Spithill, the skipper ... All of those elements come together and make it a very, very tough act for the Kiwis to beat.” The Australian connection to Oracle’s challenge also includes team general manager Grant Simmer, who was technical navigator on Bertrand’s 12-metre yacht in the 1983 regatta, and 24-year-old trimmer Kyle Langford, the youngest sailor in this year’s America’s Cup. Despite a strong sailing tradition and success at Olympic level, Australia have not had a challenger for the Auld Mug since Kookaburra III lost the 1987 defence to Stars and Stripes in Fremantle. “There are more Australians now competing in this America’s Cup than any other nation in the world. So it’s not an issue of people and technology. These projects cost $100 million,” said Bertrand, who hoped the thrilling finish to this year’s regatta might pique interest of Australia’s mining magnates. “They’ve been busy trading with China at the moment and they’ve not really had much reason to go beyond that. “It’s just a matter of having the right people who have that ambition, and that includes the funding behind it, and that’s a serendipity requirement.” ",9252013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sailing-americascup-bertrand/team-nz-must-shed-scar-tissue-says-bertrand-idUSBRE98O09T20130925
72,ORCL,Larry Ellison glows under shine of America's Cup,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - For Larry Ellison, the only thing better than winning the America’s Cup is winning it against all odds. Ellison’s Oracle Team USA was within an inch of losing the world’s oldest international sporting trophy to Emirates Team New Zealand just a week ago, only to come back on Thursday with the eighth straight race it needed to retain the Cup. The epic battle over the past few days has been a major vindication of the Silicon Valley entrepreneur’s much-maligned vision of how to modernize the competition. For months ahead of September’s 34th America’s Cup finals, Ellison, known for his brash personality and aggressive business tactics, weathered near-constant criticism over the cost, complexity and potential dangers of the 72-foot catamarans he chose for the event. Only three teams ultimately challenged Oracle, and a British sailor was killed when the Swedish team’s AC72 broke apart and capsized in May. “There was a lot of criticism about these boats,” Ellison told reporters on Thursday. “I thought that rather than me personally responding, it would be up to the guys ultimately to show what these boats are like on the water. Let the regatta get started and let the people judge.” And spectators ultimately ruled in Ellison’s favor, partly because he brought the regatta, historically held miles out to sea, into San Francisco Bay where strolling tourists and die-hard sailing aficionados could watch the races up close. “This regatta has changed sailing forever,” he beamed at a news conference, flanked by Oracle skipper Jimmy Spithill and the 162-year-old trophy. Sailing has been in Ellison’s blood for about as long as Oracle has. When he moved in the 1960s from Chicago to northern California, where he would eventually launch Oracle Corp, the future tycoon lived on a modest sailboat moored in Berkeley Marina until he ran out of money and had to sell it. In 1998, Ellison was aboard his maxi yacht Sayonara when its won the 630-nautical mile (724 mile) Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, which turned tragic when a storm killed six people and destroyed several boats. He brought this year’s regatta to San Francisco after his team in 2010 beat Swiss biotechnology billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli’s Alinghi in a bitter America’s Cup battle fought as much by Ellison’s lawyers as by his sailors. Oracle Team USA’s determination against all odds is also a fitting metaphor for challenges that four-decade-old Oracle now faces against a sea of smaller, aggressive technology rivals. Ellison’s sailing team has been a convenient marketing tool for Oracle for years, but the style in which it won this year’s Cup - excelling when the chips were down - now gives him a powerful image to convey to shareholders worried that the No. 3 software company is in danger of losing its lead to younger competitors. “Its historic comeback against the odds in this race speaks to the character of both Larry and his company. This sends an important message to customers that Larry and Oracle never give up,” said FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives. While Ellison watched his team from a speedboat this week, Oracle has been holding its annual customer conference at a nearby San Francisco convention center, with over 60,000 people registered for the event. He even skipped his keynote speech when it conflicted with a race. But Oracle kept the regatta front and center at the event, making attendees acutely aware of the crew’s progress on the water by piping TV commentary into lounges and leading cheers to support the team. Thursday’s victory entitles Ellison and his team to again change the rules and venue for the next Cup, should they choose. Emirates Team New Zealand spent about $100 million on its failed America’s Cup campaign, and while Ellison refused to comment on suggestions he spent much more than that, he agreed that costs must be brought down in order to attract more challengers to future regattas. “It’s no secret these boats are expensive. We’d like to have more countries competing next time, so we’re going to have to figure out how to accomplish both - getting more countries competing while keeping it spectacular.” ",9262013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sailing-americascup-ellison/larry-ellison-glows-under-shine-of-americas-cup-idUSBRE98P03J20130926
73,ORCL,Ainslie sets sights on British challenge,"LONDON (Reuters) - Ben Ainslie, hailed as Britain’s most celebrated sailor since Admiral Lord Nelson after helping Oracle Team USA to America’s Cup victory, wants to win the ‘Auld Mug’ for his countrymen next time around. “Now this America’s Cup is over, things will develop pretty quickly for the next Cup and we have to wait and see where and when that will be and in what type of boat,” Ainslie told Sky Sports News on Thursday. “But absolutely, a British team is something that is very viable and if we got the right people together we could ultimately be successful,” added the most decorated Olympic sailor of all time. Ainslie, who has four Olympic gold medals and a silver and was knighted for his services to the sport, is the first British sailor to add success in the America’s Cup to an Olympic title. The 36-year-old was drafted in as Oracle’s tactician when their defense looked to be floundering against Emirates Team New Zealand. With him on board, Oracle staged one of sport’s greatest comebacks to win the 34th America’s Cup in San Francisco Bay 9-8 after being 8-1 down. “For me personally, as a kid growing up, I dreamt of one day being involved with the America’s Cup. I grew up down in Falmouth in Cornwall and used to watch Peter de Savary’s America’s Cup boats training,” Ainslie said. “So to win it is unbelievable and perhaps one day we can see a British team winning it. We’ve got a very proud maritime heritage in the UK and it’s where it all started, the America’s Cup, back in 1851. “So hopefully, one day we’ll see it back in British waters.” Ainslie set up Ben Ainslie Racing before the London Olympics to compete in the America’s Cup World Series, a standalone championship designed to fill the gap between Cups, but said then that he would be aiming to be a challenger for the 35th America’s Cup. English entrepreneur De Savary entered a challenge for the Cup in 1983 but lost out to Alan Bond’s Australia II, which went on to end the New York Yacht Club’s 132 year defense of the trophy. “In terms of the sailors and the designers, we have the talent in the UK, that’s for sure,” said Ainslie. “But it takes a lot to bring us together in terms of the commercial support, financial support, to run one of these teams.” Britain’s double Olympic gold medalist Iain Percy could be a rival to any Ainslie-led challenge as the likely skipper of Swedish-backed Artemis. Ainslie’s role in the duel between the Americans and New Zealanders was celebrated by British media on Thursday as a national success story, even if Jimmy Spithill was the triumphant skipper. “Ainslie’s golden touch powers Oracle to glory,” declared the Daily Telegraph, which also made the comparison to Nelson, in a headline. “The unlikeliest victory - Ben Ainslie leads Team Oracle to glory in America’s Cup,” trumpeted the Guardian. “Ainslie is the king of America’s Cup,” said the Daily Express.

74,ORCL,New Zealand shrugs off America's Cup loss,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister John Key summed up the feelings of his country when their America’s Cup team were beaten by Oracle Team USA in the winner-take-all showdown in San Francisco on Thursday. “Bugger,” he Tweeted from New York. In a taciturn country where one word is more than enough to convey the gamut of emotions, it said it all. Frustration, disappointment and, ultimately, resigned acceptance. Tens of thousands had been on tenterhooks for a week as Dean Barker’s Team New Zealand established what many considered an unassailable 8-1 lead, needing just one more win to clinch international sport’s oldest trophy and return it to Auckland. Oracle, however, powered back with eight successive wins to seal the trophy in a remarkable comeback that helped make the once-troubled event among the most exciting in sailing history. “Not unexpected. It just seemed fairly obvious over the last week that the gains Oracle have made they have got better and better,” Graeme Mercer, a sailing instructor at Wellington’s Royal Port Nicholson Yacht Club, told Reuters of the final day’s racing. “Our boat wouldn’t go any faster and today just showed that despite the minor errors that Team New Zealand had made in some of the previous races, it wouldn’t have made any difference.” Backed by NZ$36 million ($30 million) in public funds, Team New Zealand’s performances to establish their lead had created a sense of expectation that a trophy they had last held in 2003 was within their grasp. Despite the stunning turnaround, Mercer said Oracle had won as a result of a sensational fightback, not by Team New Zealand choking. “Choking is an armchair critic response from people who have no idea what they’re talking about,” he added. “Maybe if you’re putting a golf ball and muff it ... but this is a technology sport and ... Team New Zealand could not have raced any faster. “Oracle continued to pull away upwind and that technology is what delivered it for them.” Oracle team boss Russell Coutts, who won the America’s Cup twice for New Zealand in 1995 and 2000, told Reuters in San Francisco that despite having a population of only 4.4 million, New Zealanders would fully have expected to win. “New Zealand expects a lot out of their sports people,” he added. “As a nation we generally fight above our weight. “As a nation we expect the All Blacks to win and expect our sailing teams to win and if they don’t people say ‘Why not?’ I don’t think that’s a bad thing.” In addition to missing out on the sport’s bragging rights, New Zealand is set to miss out on an estimated NZ$500 million in additional economic activity for its $170 billion economy. Despite the defeat, New Zealand’s marine industry was still seeing some positive spinoffs. Oracle established an 80-strong boatbuilding factory in Warkworth, north of Auckland, for the regatta, while more than 40 other local companies had provided components and expertise to the four syndicates. “What happened was all very unfortunate, but the positive spin is that it’s really revitalized the America’s Cup,” said Peter Thomas, project manager at Cookson Boats, which built TNZ’s two state-of-the-art 72-foot catamarans. “The man in the street now is excited to watch it. “Team New Zealand did such a bloody good job that I’m sure the whole world feels for them. “They didn’t win it but everything else is good. The New Zealand marine industry will benefit from this.” ",9262013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sailing-americascup-zealand/new-zealand-shrugs-off-americas-cup-loss-idUSBRE98P03M20130926

76,ORCL,"Capping an epic comeback, Oracle wins the America's Cup","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oracle Team USA prevailed in a dramatic winner-take-all showdown with Emirates Team New Zealand on Wednesday to win the 34th America’s Cup, completing a stirring comeback that helped make the once-troubled event among the most exciting in sailing history. For Oracle and its hard-charging skipper, Jimmy Spithill, the win was an extraordinary sporting triumph, one that saw the team climb back from a seemingly insurmountable 8-1 deficit in the best-of-17 series to keep the trophy it won three years ago. The thrilling final races were also a ringing vindication of Oracle owner Larry Ellison’s controversial decision to transform a once-staid yachting event into a TV-friendly, extreme-sports spectacle featuring huge catamarans flying across the natural amphitheatre of San Francisco Bay at 50 miles per hour. “A lot of people who were never interested in sailing are now interested in sailing,” Ellison said at a post-race news conference. “This regatta has changed sailing forever.” Emirates Team New Zealand, a plucky challenger that lacked a billionaire sponsor but nonetheless sailed to the brink of Cup victory, must now endure the ignominy of having let the prize slip from its grasp in the final days after a grueling two-year campaign of boat development and training. Oracle dominated the last race, showcasing the dramatic improvements in boat speed on the upwind leg of the race that began to emerge a week ago. Oracle seemed to find an extra gear after losing most of the early races, and even overcame a pre-match penalty that required it win 11 races on the water. The speed improvements appeared to come mainly from changes that enabled the boat to consistently “foil,” or lift almost completely out of the water on small horizontal wings, even when heading upwind. The team also changed tacticians after its early losses, installing Britain’s Ben Ainslie - the winningest Olympic sailor in history - in that spot in place of San Francisco native John Kostecki. The winning Oracle team had only one American on board. As one of the most coveted sporting prizes, the America’s Cup over its 162-year history has fueled patriotism even in non sailors and winning the trophy was seen as a mark of a nation’s seafaring greatness. When Australia broke America’s 132-year hold on the Cup in 1983 the jubilation brought normal business to a standstill. Just a week ago, New Zealand fans had all but begun celebrating what seemed like an inevitable sporting and economic windfall for the longtime international sailing power, which supported the team with about $30 million in government funds in the hopes of bringing the trophy - and attendant tourism and publicity - back home. But on Wednesday it was Ellison who was celebrating, joining the crew on the boat for a champagne shower in the moments after the finish. New Zealand’s soft-spoken skipper, Dean Barker, called the defeat “very difficult to accept—a very tough pill to swallow.” Fans who flocked to the San Francisco bayfront by the tens of thousands for the final races were treated to a little bit of everything: tense on-the-water duels, a near-capsize, winds that were alternately too light and too strong, and even a whale that threatened to disrupt racing. While Kiwi fans in San Francisco seemed to outnumber Oracle supporters through much of the regatta, the big crowds on the final days were distinctly pro-U.S. as local fans cheered the Oracle comeback. “Watching the comeback and seeing all these new boats, it’s just so exciting,” said Chris Barnsdale, 36, a Santa Rosa contractor who has never set foot aboard a sailboat and had never watched a race until last week. He drove an hour to see Wednesday’s showdown. “When it’s a do-or-die situation, we just said we’ve gotta go watch that final race,” he said. The TV coverage also proved to be a highlight of the event, with three helicopters, two speedboats and cameras aboard the catamarans bringing the action home, augmented by state-of-the-art graphics that made it possible to follow the complex match-racing tactics. The enthusiasm was a marked turnaround for the summer-long series of America’s Cup events, which until a few weeks ago looked like a monumental bust. A British Olympic champion sailing for the Swedish team was killed in a training accident in May, calling the safety of the boats into question and forcing contentious rule changes. New Zealand completely dominated the Louis Vuitton challenger series, which featured only three competitors and saw some “races” with only one boat charging around the course. A cheating scandal erupted, with Oracle ultimately being docked two races and losing a key crew member as punishment for illegal boat modifications in a preliminary series. And Oracle had to recover from a capsize last year in which its boat was dragged out to sea and all but destroyed - an event Spithill cited Wednesday as a devastating moment but one that ultimately helped pull the team together. In San Francisco, meanwhile, many locals bristled at city support for what has often been derided as a rich man’s yacht race. On Wednesday, though, California Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom, who negotiated to bring the Cup to San Francisco when he was mayor of the city, was also declaring victory. He lauded Ellison’s vision, and said in a statement that the economic benefits for the city would be “well north” of the $480 million in economic activity generated by the most recent Super Bowl. Ellison was non-committal as to whether he would hold the event in San Francisco next time. “Personally, I’d love to come back to San Francisco,” he said, but suggested that extensive discussions with city officials lay ahead. Oracle had plenty of advantages coming into the regatta. It was on its home turf, and had enough money to hire top sailors and build two equally matched boats to train against one another. The team was distinctly international, with New Zealander Russell Coutts, who led the Kiwis to Cup victory in 1995 and 2000, serving as CEO and the Australian Spithill as the skipper. When only three challengers proved willing to take on the cost and complexity of the 72-foot carbon fiber yachts, Oracle’s chances looked even better - though it faced criticism that the dearth of competitors had diminished interest in the event and made it a bad financial deal for San Francisco. But the Kiwis, led by a 56-year-old managing director, Grant Dalton, who doubled as a workhorse on-board “grinder” during races, proved ingenious in developing their boat, particularly in pioneering the use of hydrofoils that lift both hulls almost entirely of the water to reduce drag. Barker steered nearly flawless races through most of the competition as New Zealand first crushed the Italian team, Luna Rossa, in the challenger series, and then dominated Oracle in the early races of the Cup finals. But now the America’s Cup, with its rich history of dueling tycoons, gamesmanship and cutting-edge boat technology, appears firmly headed in the innovative direction Ellison envisioned. Dalton, a fierce critic of the AC72s, said he still considered the boats too expensive for robust competition in the future, though he lauded the San Francisco venue. Ellison said one unnamed team had already stepped up as a challenger for the next Cup. Dalton wouldn’t say whether he would be back. But Ellison said: “An America’s Cup without a New Zealand, it’s just impossible to conceive of that.” ",9262013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sailing-americascup/capping-an-epic-comeback-oracle-wins-the-americas-cup-idUSBRE98N15120130926

78,ORCL,"For America's Cup, return to San Francisco no sure thing","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - After a spectacular America’s Cup regatta capped by home-team Oracle’s thrilling comeback victory, there should be little question about the event returning to San Francisco. Yet the Cup has many critics in this famously liberal city, and they had plenty to say as controversies dogged the event in the long run-up to the exciting final series. It’s far from certain that Oracle boss Larry Ellison - who, as the Cup holder, has the right to choose the venue - will be able to reach an agreement with the city for the next Cup, which is likely to take place four years from now. Some local officials and political activists have objected from the beginning to city support for what critics deride as a rich man’s yacht race. While most of the direct costs were born by the America’s Cup Event Authority or recouped as part of complicated deals on infrastructure improvements, the city agreed to spend $20 million on policing, facilities and other services. City officials planned to raise the money from private donors but have so far come up about $4 million short. “We would love to come back to San Francisco,” Ellison said at a news conference Wednesday. “San Francisco’s a great place. This has been a spectacular regatta. But we’re going to sit down and talk with the officials in San Francisco and see if it’s going to be possible to come back.” For the city, the economic benefits in the form of increased tourism, temporary jobs and the payoff from the images of San Francisco that formed a perfect backdrop for TV coverage are hard to calculate and have not yet been tallied. Still, the Cup was not the boon to local businesses that officials had predicted. With only three challenger teams rather than the 12 to 15 once anticipated, the summer-long preliminary matches were interesting mainly for the wrong reasons - including a fatal accident and a cheating scandal - and crowds were far smaller than expected. Until the dramatic finale, local merchants complained that they hadn’t seen much additional business. Even after the finals began on September 7, San Francisco Supervisor John Avalos quipped that there were “more California seals than people” taking in the action along the waterfront. San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee and California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, who was instrumental in negotiating the Cup deal when he was mayor, rejected the idea that the event had not been worth it for the city. Newsom said the Cup’s economic benefits would come in “well north” of the $480 million in economic activity generated by the most recent Super Bowl. He said it would be substantially more the next time around. “All that heartache, all the lessons learned, all that’s banked now,” Newsom told Reuters. “We’re uniquely positioned to take it to a whole ‘nother level. Then the economic benefits are extraordinary.” If organizers change the boat design rules to lower entry costs and attract more challengers, as they have pledged to do, all agree that the economic benefits for the host city would be greater. Yet plenty of political and practical challenges remain. A new cruise ship terminal built by the city was the primary onshore venue for the event, housing a media center for some 550 journalists along with shops, restaurants, a concert arena and docking areas for officials boats and visiting mega-yachts. Whether the city could make other arrangements for cruise ships so Ellison could use the terminal during a subsequent regatta is expected to be subject to negotiations. Another pair of piers that housed two of the challenger teams is set to become the home of a new arena for the NBA’s Golden State Warriors basketball team - a franchise that Ellison, ironically, tried and failed to buy three years ago. Newsom said finding locations wouldn’t be a problem. “This is a huge waterfront,” he said. “There’ll be plenty of options if they choose to stay.” Ellison alluded Wednesday to lessons he had learned from the often-contentious 2010 negotiations with the city, which ended with one major part of an initial agreement - a deal in which Ellison would have renovated crumbling piers in exchange for development rights - being scrapped. Many local political leaders feared the city was giving too much away. Ellison said he and the city had unrealistic expectations when they signed “very, very complex development deals,” with neither anticipating how difficult it would be to obtain federal and state development permits along the waterfront, or how costly it would be to repair city piers. “There are so many different government agencies having to approve the development of the piers, and getting all of that done in a very short period of time was probably an overly ambitious ask on our part and very difficult for the government of San Francisco to actually deliver,” he said. Ellison insisted that he did not take the criticism directed his way by Cup opponents personally. Yet the city has long had a love-hate relationship with its billionaires, and local crowds appeared to be cheering for New Zealand until Oracle mounted its epic comeback from an 8-1 deficit to keep the trophy. “My hope is that Larry Ellison will give the good people of San Diego the opportunity to subsidize his race the next time,” quipped Aaron Peskin, a former supervisor and an influential Democratic power broker - though he conceded that he enjoyed the races. Ellison certainly has plenty of choices. He joked at the press conference about racing around Lanai, the Hawaiian island that he purchased almost in its entirety last year. San Diego has hosted the Cup in the past, and for decades the races were run in Newport, Rhode Island, which unsuccessfully offered Ellison a sweet deal for this year’s Cup.

80,ORCL,Sailing-Australian wine mogul to challenge for America's Cup,"(Reuters) - An Australian winemaker and his son, who own an island off Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, have officially challenged software mogul Larry Ellison’s Oracle Team USA for the next America’s Cup, a source with knowledge of the situation told Reuters. Bob Oatley and oldest son Sandy signed the challenge on behalf of their Hamilton Island Yacht Club in Queensland, Australia, the source said. An employee of the Robert Oatley Vineyards delivered a signed document to a representative of the Golden Gate Yacht Club, Oracle’s sponsor, on San Francisco Bay seconds after the winning American team crossed the finish line on Wednesday. As the challenger of record, the Oatleys could help shape the rules for the 35th America’s Cup along with the defender, Ellison. Additional challengers are expected to emerge as the next competition takes shape in the coming years. Ellison said that he received the challenge on the water as soon as Oracle clinched the Cup, but he declined to name the challenger. Asked to confirm that it was Oatley, Tom Ehman of the Golden Gate Yacht Club refused to comment. “I’ll announce early next week, possibly Monday,” he said in a text message. Two sources who requested anonymity confirmed to Reuters that the Hamilton Island Yacht Club is the challenger of record. Oatley could not be reached for comment. Oatley made a fortune first as a coffee trader and then as a vintner, and bought Hamilton Island in 2003. A long-time competitive sailing enthusiast, he is described on a website for Robert Oatley Vineyards in northern California as being “as famous for his wine as he is for sailing.” A series of his super-maxi yachts, all dubbed Wild Oats, have won multiple times one of the world’s most challenging offshore challenges - the Sydney-to-Hobart long-distance ocean race. A website for Oatley family wines boasts about the latest version of the yacht, Wild Oats XI. Iain Murray, an Australian who served as the regatta director for the just-completed America’s Cup races in San Francisco, crews on the boat, the website says. Forbes ranked Oatley as Australia’s 25th richest with just under $1 billion. Ellison is the world’s fifth richest man with $43 billion. An Australian boat sporting an innovative winged keel broke a 132-year U.S. chokehold on the famous sailing trophy in 1983.

81,ORCL,Sailing-Australian wine mogul to challenge for America's Cup,"Sept 28 (Reuters) - An Australian winemaker and his son, who own an island off Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, have officially challenged software mogul Larry Ellison’s Oracle Team USA for the next America’s Cup, a source with knowledge of the situation told Reuters. Bob Oatley and oldest son Sandy signed the challenge on behalf of their Hamilton Island Yacht Club in Queensland, Australia, the source said. An employee of the Robert Oatley Vineyards delivered a signed document to a representative of the Golden Gate Yacht Club, Oracle’s sponsor, on San Francisco Bay seconds after the winning American team crossed the finish line on Wednesday. As the challenger of record, the Oatleys could help shape the rules for the 35th America’s Cup along with the defender, Ellison. Additional challengers are expected to emerge as the next competition takes shape in the coming years. Ellison said that he received the challenge on the water as soon as Oracle clinched the Cup, but he declined to name the challenger. Asked to confirm that it was Oatley, Tom Ehman of the Golden Gate Yacht Club refused to comment. “I’ll announce early next week, possibly Monday,” he said in a text message. Two sources who requested anonymity confirmed to Reuters that the Hamilton Island Yacht Club is the challenger of record. Oatley could not be reached for comment. Oatley made a fortune first as a coffee trader and then as a vintner, and bought Hamilton Island in 2003. A long-time competitive sailing enthusiast, he is described on a website for Robert Oatley Vineyards in northern California as being “as famous for his wine as he is for sailing.” A series of his super-maxi yachts, all dubbed Wild Oats, have won multiple times one of the world’s most challenging offshore challenges - the Sydney-to-Hobart long-distance ocean race. A website for Oatley family wines boasts about the latest version of the yacht, Wild Oats XI. Iain Murray, an Australian who served as the regatta director for the just-completed America’s Cup races in San Francisco, crews on the boat, the website says. Forbes ranked Oatley as Australia’s 25th richest with just under $1 billion. Ellison is the world’s fifth richest man with $43 billion. An Australian boat sporting an innovative winged keel broke a 132-year U.S. chokehold on the famous sailing trophy in 1983.

82,ORCL,SAILING-Oracle sailors learned flying for America's Cup comeback,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The come-from-behind victory of Larry Ellison’s America’s Cup team is a tale of learning how to fly a boat - and pushing the equipment, the rules and the crew to the very limit in the process. Ellison’s Oracle Team USA fought back from an 8-1 deficit against the mighty Emirates Team New Zealand to win sailing’s biggest trophy last week in a series of races in 72-foot high-tech catamarans that sometimes exceeded 50 miles per hour (80 kph) on San Francisco Bay. The Oracle comeback was lauded as one of the greatest in sports history. Yet the abrupt turnaround in the team’s performance in the middle of the finals series also has set off a flurry of speculation about whether Oracle, which began the regatta with a penalty for illegally modifying a practice boat last year, had used secret technological enhancements to engineer its comeback. An online article in Sail-World summarized speculation that Oracle may have used “superhuman’ technology,” such as a computer-controlled stabilization system, that would have been against the rules. Oracle emphatically rejected the notion of any high-tech silver bullet, and there is no evidence that the team did anything illegal. Some of the speculation appears to stem from a protest lodged by New Zealand just before the finals began over an Oracle system that used an electrical switch to control the movements of the boat’s daggerboards. The challenge was rejected by the jury that addresses rules disputes, in part because it was lodged too late. The system might have helped Oracle perfect the intricate movements of daggerboards, sails and rudders that were needed to keep the boat sailing at top speed - although it was far from being any sort of computerized control system. Oracle says it achieved the turnaround the old-fashioned way: continual adjustments to the intricate boats, experimentation with sailing tactics, and relentless hard work by the sailors and the shore crew. The turnaround appeared to begin just before race six, when Oracle was down 4-1 and used its single “postponement card” to take a 47-hour timeout to overhaul its boat, crew and training regimen. It started tweaking its boat each night - when it was hauled out of the water and the 135-foot wing was removed - and practicing on rest days, which New Zealand did not appear to do, or need to do. It returned to the race course each day with improved speed and crew work. The America’s Cup yachts are 72-foot catamarans, which by design are fast because they can sail with just one hull in the water for less resistance. But the New Zealand team was the first to perfect hydrofoiling, finding that the boats could be nudged to lift the hulls completely out of the water onto thin carbon-fiber blades. As they ‘foil,’ they appear to fly above the water - and their speed increases with reduced drag. The rival boats had never faced off on the water before the finals started on Sept. 7. Throughout the regatta the boats looked evenly matched on the downwind legs, reaching speeds approaching 50 mph. The regatta was won and lost during the upwind zigzags, where Oracle’s team mastered the trick of flying on the foils. Oracle’s lead designer, Dirk Kramer, told Reuters the U.S.-based team initially misjudged how fast the Kiwis would be sailing the boat into the wind. Early races were an eye opener and the focus shifted from performance with the wind to sailing into it, which required stabilizing the boat on its foils and a new approach to steering and wing trim. Oracle began the finals two races behind and without a key crew member as punishment for breaking the rules by adding weight to its boat in a preliminary series. It had to recover from a capsize during training last year in which its boat was dragged out to sea and all but destroyed, an event Skipper Jimmy Spithill cited as a devastating moment but one that ultimately helped pull the team together. The class rules allowed teams to make certain changes to their purpose-built AC72s. But even the tiniest alterations were checked by a team of independent measurers before racing and certified as conforming to specifications. Sail experts and insiders have been speculating about how Oracle stabilized their boat, allowing it to foil better. “Before they postponed that race, the (Oracle) boat was unstable when it was foiling, and they weren’t foiling upwind,” said Peter Thomas, who was on the building team at Cookson Boats, which built the New Zealand boat. “They definitely weren’t foiling as well as Team New Zealand were. And after two days in the shed, the boat came out foiling everywhere.” Much of the discussion was based on whether electronics, computers or a motion-stabilizing gyroscope did some of the work meant to be handled by the crew. David Le Pelley, manager of the Yacht Research Unit and Wind Tunnel at the University of Auckland, which helped the New Zealand team, said both teams tuned their boats. “Team New Zealand had a lot more time in the water given the Oracle crash, so Oracle had been on the back foot to some extent, so they’d had to play catch up and they got to the point where they managed to get more out of the boat than we did at the end,” he said. Kramer on Saturday denied any use of computer-automated controls to manage the foils and stabilize the yacht. “Negative. No,” he said. The yacht had a stabilization system but it was operated by humans, Kramer said. “There’s no computer driving any surfaces at all.” Small electronic switches were used to open and close the hydraulic valves clutches. Theses were commercially available, not customized, according to Kramer. The measurement committee gave Oracle permission in August to use an “electro-mechanical actuator” to move a valve. The jury on Sept. 6 dismissed New Zealand’s claim that the actuator violated the manpower-only rule but on the basis that it was filed too late. “Most items we used in there are literally servos from your kid’s remote-control airplane,” Kramer said. “It’s exactly as simple as that. It gets bolted to a valve and that is what operates things.” Kramer said the many changes made to the yacht were “all small and all visible.” “A lot had to do with the balance of the boat,” he said. Minor changes were made to the shape of the 135-foot tall wing - the catamaran’s main sail - and to the rear of the hulls. To reduce wind resistance, they swapped out the pointy bowsprit between the boat’s two hulls with a stubbier version, because the winds were too strong for the billowing headsail that attaches to it. The top of the vertical fixed wing was tilted slightly forward and rearward to try different “rake” angles. Oracle also replaced renowned tactician John Kostecki, a San Francisco hometown favorite, with British Olympic sailing champion Ben Ainslie, the backup skipper on Oracle’s practice yacht, leaving a single American on the winning boat. “The sailors made a change to the way they were sailing the boat so we adapted the boat to help them make that change. There was no silver bullet,” said Grant Simmer, general manager of the Oracle team, denying speculation that Oracle had flown in extra carbon fiber components from New Zealand where parts of its 72-foot catamaran were built. Meanwhile, Ellison, the billionaire software mogul of Oracle Corp, was a cheerleader on the sidelines, leaving the decisions to his well-paid professionals. “He was encouraging us to keep going and never give in,” Simmer said. In New Zealand, the loss has frequently been explained as boiling down to money - that the Kiwis in the end could not compete with a billionaire. Oracle acknowledged it had outspent New Zealand but it is not clear how much by. Estimates of Oracle’s cup defense range well over $100 million but sources said the spigots were not opened any wider for the emergency work carried out after the team lost four of the event’s first five races to the Kiwis. New Zealand backed its team with about $30 million in government funds. Managing Director Grant Dalton also raised tens of millions of dollars from sponsors over several years, and said the team spent about $100 million in all. Oracle Team USA CEO Russell Coutts told Reuters that the team probably spent 10 percent more than New Zealand, based on his estimate of a Kiwi outlay of 105 million to 110 million euros ($142 million to $149 million.) He said salaries for designers and sailors made up 56 percent of Oracle’s cost. In the end, though, a dejected Dean Barker, skipper of the Kiwi yacht, said in a post-racing blog that his team had wrung all the performance possible out of its boat before the race, while Oracle came in with room to improve. Oracle just learned to fly the boat well, he wrote. “Their boat was better suited for doing that for extended periods,” Barker said. “They certainly were doing a better job finding that extra gear that we simply couldn’t.”",9292013,http://www.reuters.com/article/sailing-americascup-boat/sailing-oracle-sailors-learned-flying-for-americas-cup-comeback-idUSL2N0HO0LU20130929

84,ORCL,Top U.S. political donors in 2012 among country's richest men,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The country’s top political donors in the 2012 election cycle represent a wealthy slice of the United States, with most of them being men, according to a study released Tuesday that analyzes campaign finance data. The research (here), published by Public Campaign, a Washington-based advocacy group, comes one week before the U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in McCutcheon v Federal Election Commission. The case concerns the constitutionality of campaign contribution limits. If the court strikes down current limits, it could prompt larger contributions from donors who gave the maximum in the 2012 elections, Public Campaign said. That election cycle, the most expensive on record, featured more than $6 billion in spending across federal campaigns, according to Washington research group The Center for Responsive Politics. The Public Campaign study showed that 1,219 individual donors gave at least $105,300 - within 10 percent of the $117,000 aggregate limit - to candidates, party committees, and political action committees in 2012. The data covers disclosed contributions from individuals and not from corporations, unions or undisclosed group donations. “It’s a very tiny handful, an elite handful, of Americans,” said Nick Nyhart, president and chief executive of Public Campaign, which studied data from the FEC, the U.S. Census Bureau and The Center for Responsive Politics. The analysis showed that money from the top donors, totaling more than $150 million, broke 56 percent to Republicans and 41 percent to Democrats. The rest went to third-party candidates or political action committees, or PACs. Nearly nine out of 10 donors gave more than 90 percent to one party alone. Just over one quarter of the donors who listed their gender are women, the study showed. Liberal critics of the existing campaign finance system have likened the McCutcheon case to a second Citizens United v FEC, the 2010 case that resulted in the creation of so-called super PACs. A super PAC is an independent political action committee that can raise unlimited amounts and is not required to disclose contributions. Super PAC money largely goes to advertising for causes and not to candidates or political parties. ‘E-BAY FOR MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES’ The analysis showed that three of the five richest Americans gave up to the contribution limit of $117,000 in 2012, alongside one of every six of the country’s billionaires. Larry Ellison, founder and CEO of software giant Oracle, was joined atop the list of wealthiest donors by David and Charles Koch, brothers who run Koch Industries and were prominent Republican supporters in 2012. More than a quarter of the country’s 100 wealthiest citizens gave up to the limit, the analysis showed. California, New York, Texas, Florida, and Illinois are home to more large donors than all the other states combined. The study showed that nearly 29 percent of the large donors work in finance. One-tenth are lawyers or lobbyists. “You’re going to end up having politics be E-Bay for millionaires and billionaires,” Nyhart, referring to the popular shopping website, said of the potential end of contribution limits. But former Federal Elections Commission chairman Brad Smith, whose Center for Competitive Politics has filed an amicus brief in the case arguing against the contribution limits, said worries about a small group of people having disproportionate influence are unfounded. “Historically, this is how campaigns have always been funded. A handful of people, from their personal fortunes, kept the revolution going,” he said. Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky will participate in the Supreme Court oral arguments, in opposition to contribution limits. The McCutcheon case was brought by Alabama businessman Shaun McCutcheon and the Republican National Committee.

85,ORCL,Australians pushing for thrifty America's Cup,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia’s Hamilton Island Yacht Club will push to ensure the next America’s Cup does not boil down to a “race of money” with Larry Ellison’s Oracle Team USA, but will fight hard to woo the country’s top sailing talent back from the defender. Hamilton Island, owned by wine magnate and sailing enthusiast Bob Oatley and run by his son Sandy, was confirmed by the Golden Gate Yacht Club as the Challenger of Record for the 35th America’s Cup late on Monday. The 34th Cup that wrapped up last week had only three challengers, with the costs of the campaign, which was raced in super-fast AC72 catamarans, put in excess of $100 million and cited as the main reason why so few teams went to San Francisco. As the Challenger of Record, Hamilton Island will help shape the rules for the next regatta with Oracle, whose software tycoon owner has also talked of the need to contain costs after being criticised for the complexity of the hi-tech AC72s. Sandy Oatley praised Oracle and the beaten Team New Zealand for putting on a thrilling regatta in San Francisco Bay after raising the technology stakes but said lower costs would help attract more challengers for the next incarnation, set for 2016. “It did cost a lot, the technology, but I think they’ve taken it into the next realm of sailing,” he told Reuters in an interview by phone from Sydney. “I think the way they’ve developed it in this case has made it very exciting and all the people who were able to watch it were absolutely amazed. “I think (overseas competitors) are all welcoming the fact of trying to contain the costs. “My father Bob was saying, for a sailing race, we’re trying to get the emphasis 100 percent on sailing, with 50 percent on the sailing expertise, 40 percent the boat and 10 percent in technology and development. “We can put some boxes around the boats and the sails so it doesn’t become a race of money.” Forbes has ranked Oatley, who made his fortune first as a coffee trader and then as a vintner, as Australia’s 25th richest with just under $1 billion. Ellison is the world’s fifth richest man with $43 billion. Backed by NZ$36 million ($29.98 million) in public funds, Team New Zealand were overhauled by Oracle after storming to an 8-1 lead in the first to nine-points regatta, as the defenders worked over-time to glean extra speed from their boat in the final week. While Bob Oatley has entered a series of successful super-maxi yachts in the Sydney-to-Hobart long-distance ocean race, one of the world’s most testing offshore challenges, ensuring funds to compete with Oracle will be paramount. Sandy Oatley said the Australian challenge was yet to sign any corporate backers, and like Team New Zealand did, would seek support from government coffers. “We’ll be talking to (the government),” he said. “I’m sure it will be of keen interest to them but we haven’t spoken to them yet. I think they’ve got bigger things on their mind right now. “We’re talking to (potential corporate sponsors), but we weren’t really talking (before) because we weren’t really sure what was happening,” he said. “That’ll happen in the next couple of weeks. We’re looking for a great Australian challenge with some Australian corporates and great Australian sailors.” While concerned about costs, Oatley said the challenger’s preference would be to see some version of the high-speed catamarans retained for the next series and more fleet racing in the leadup. “It was very exciting, the racing, and anyone that saw the America’s Cup would know that you’ve only got to make one little mistake and suddenly you go from first to last,” he said. Hamilton Island’s challenge comes 30 years after Australia II’s 1983 victory over the Dennis Conner-skippered Liberty, which ended the 132-year-old U.S. chokehold over the famous sailing trophy and sparked huge celebrations Down Under. The 35th America’s Cup will be the first time Australia has had an entry, however, since Oracle captain James Spithill skippered ‘Young Australia’ in the 30th edition in Auckland in 2000. Australian sailors have been in force at America’s Cup challenges since, however, and Oatley said luring the likes of Spithill and Oracle strategist Tom Slingsby, who won a sailing gold at the London Olympics, away from the U.S. team would be a high priority. “We don’t know contractually how the Oracle boys are all tied up but that will all happen in the future and once we work out the protocols for the 35th race, we’ll see,” he said. “There are lots of great Australian sailors and Jimmy Spithill’s top of the list at the moment with his recent success. “(1983) really brought Australia together and it came home to us last week ... It was a great thing what they did and we’re hoping to do the same again for Australia.” ",10012013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sailing-americascup-challenger-oatley/australians-pushing-for-thrifty-americas-cup-idUSBRE99005Q20131001
86,ORCL,Ellison gives up $500 million potential payout to settle Pillar suit,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oracle Corp Chief Executive Larry Ellison has agreed to give up a potential payout of around $500 million to settle accusations of a conflict of interest in the 2011 acquisition by Oracle of a company he controlled, according to court documents. The settlement relates to Oracle’s purchase of Pillar Data Systems Inc, a data storage company that was majority owned by Ellison. Oracle, the world’s No. 3 software maker, paid no cash up front to buy Pillar, instead agreeing to make future payments that would depend on the acquired company’s performance through 2014. Under the deal, Ellison, who co-founded Oracle and owns around a quarter of its stock, would have received the first $562 million of any payment related to the acquisition, according to the court filing. According to the settlement, whatever the payment ultimately is, Ellison must pay 95 percent of it to Oracle. The suit against Oracle’s acquisition of Pillar was launched in Delaware by two pension funds - the City of Roseville Employees’ Retirement System and the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. They said the deal to buy Pillar was “tainted by conflicts of interest and was unfair to Oracle.” Ellison has come under fire for the size of his paycheck as Oracle struggles to adapt to competition with smaller rivals and as the software company’s once-hot shares lose favor on Wall Street. The 69-year old Ellison made about $78 million in Oracle’s past fiscal year. On Wednesday, the company responded to activist investor CtW Investment Group’s criticism that Ellison’s compensation is top-heavy compared to his peers. “Shareholders have consistently and clearly articulated that they view Mr. Ellison as an extremely valuable asset to the Company,” Oracle General Counsel Dorian Daley said in an SEC filing. “And it is a role that will only grow in importance in the coming years as technology continues to advance and change at a rapid pace,” Daley said.

87,ORCL,"Exclusive: With IPO elusive, Avaya explored sale to Oracle this year - sources","SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Avaya Inc’s private equity owners explored selling the telecommunications equipment company earlier this year, instead of taking it public, and had talks with Oracle Corp, three people familiar with the matter said this week. Silver Lake and TPG Capital LP, which took Santa Clara, California-based Avaya private for $8.4 billion in 2007, held discussions with hardware and software giant Oracle in the first half of 2013 about a deal, but the talks fizzled in the last few months, the people said. Avaya filed for an initial public offering in 2011 but never pulled the trigger, despite very favorable market conditions this year, due to concerns over convincing potential investors about the company’s growth prospects. The efforts to sell the company highlight the challenges facing the private equity firms in cashing out of their investment in Avaya, whose conferencing systems and network gear are in a fierce competitive race with companies such as Cisco Systems Inc and ShoreTel Inc. Two of the sources said that while Avaya hoped it could revitalize growth to be in a position for an IPO in 2014, the buyout firms faced an uphill struggle to make the company appealing to stock market investors. The sources asked not to be identified because of the confidential nature of the discussions. Avaya and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment while Silver Lake and TPG declined to comment. Asked about an IPO, Avaya’s corporate treasurer Matt Booher told the Deutsche Bank Leveraged Finance conference this week: “Everyone is very focused on managing the business, and the things we can control in the business to put ourselves in the right position to be in that gate, if you will, or that position.” The company’s sales are split roughly equally between products, such as phones and video conferencing devices, and services for the communications networks of companies. It has over 300,000 customers, including more than 95 percent of the Fortune 500 companies. Avaya reported revenue of $5.17 billion in its fiscal 2012, down 7 percent compared to a year ago, while its earnings on an adjusted basis were flat, as the company struggled to maintain the appeal of its products in a highly competitive market. For the third fiscal quarter of 2013, revenue was $1.15 billion, down 8 percent from the year ago. Avaya has looked to acquisitions to boost growth. Its biggest under Silver Lake and TPG was the takeover of bankrupt Nortel Networks Corp’s enterprise solutions business for $933 million in 2009. Yet most of the improvements in the company’s profits have come from operational changes and cost savings. In its third-quarter earnings call in August, its chief executive, Kevin Kennedy, said that the company’s gross margin percentage of 56 percent was the highest for any quarter in Avaya’s history. Avaya had $6.1 billion in debt and $303 million in cash at the end of March 2013.

88,ORCL,UPDATE 1-Citrix guides results below expectations; shares dive,"(Adds details, background, analysts’ comments; updates share movement) By Neha Alawadhi and Aditya Kondalamahanty Oct 9 (Reuters) - Cloud computing software maker Citrix Systems Inc estimated quarterly results below analysts’ expectations as businesses delayed contracts, sending its shares down as much as 14 percent in extended trading. Cloud computing companies such as Citrix and VMware Inc  have been facing delays in closing large deals as customers review IT budgets to prune discretionary spending. Citrix’s warning could set the tone for other software companies as it comes just ahead of the third-quarter reporting season. VMware shares fell 3.3 percent after the bell. Cloud computing software allows customers to access applications remotely from a central server, and reduces costs by eliminating the need to upgrade and install software on each individual computer on site. “It has been a soft spending environment for infrastructure software companies as seen recently by Oracle Corp and Red Hat Inc,” FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said. “Citrix is the latest victim.” In September, Oracle forecast sales and profit below expectations for the quarter ending Nov. 30, while Red Hat said it was under pressure to maintain billings growth. Citrix’s profit and revenue estimates for the third quarter came in below its own forecast issued in July. Analysts said the weak outlook indicated that sales of the company’s networking products, which helped it beat estimates in the second quarter, could be slowing down. “I think when you have a miss of $25 million, it raises the concern that the weakness has spread to the networking business,” said Raymond James analyst Michael Turits. The networking business, which makes products that help improve the performance of Web applications, accounted for about 23 percent of Citrix’s sales in the second quarter. The company, scheduled to report third-quarter results on Oct. 23, said it expects adjusted earnings of 68-69 cents per share on revenue of $710 million-$712 million. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 73 cents per share on revenue of $737.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Citrix shares were down 14 percent at $57.51 after the bell.

89,ORCL,Advisors recommend votes against Oracle board over pay,"(Reuters) - Top proxy advisors recommended votes against key directors of software maker Oracle Corp, citing concerns over executive pay. The recommendations promise to stir up a debate over compensation at the company’s annual meeting scheduled for the end of this month. Institutional Shareholder Services, the largest advisor for institutional investors, recommended “withhold” votes for eight of Oracle’s 11 board members in a report released on Tuesday. It also suggested an advisory vote “against” the company’s executive pay. ISS said it recommended withholding the votes against the board members “for failing to provide effective oversight of management on behalf of shareholders” in areas like executive pay practices. Last year, the company’s pay for top executives won support from just 41 percent of votes cast, and the company’s compensation committee did not respond adequately, according to ISS. In addition on Tuesday, rival proxy advisor Glass, Lewis & Co released a report that recommended “withhold” votes against five Oracle directors, also citing pay concerns in some cases, and recommended votes “against” the company’s executive pay. A third advisor, Egan-Jones Proxy Services, recommended votes “for” all directors but “against” Oracle’s executive pay. CtW Investment Group, which advises union-affiliated pension funds, has also criticized the company’s pay practices and opposed the re-election of compensation committee members.

92,ORCL,Obamacare website gets new tech experts; oversight pressure grows,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration said it has brought in experts from top technology companies including Google Inc and Oracle Corp to fix the HealthCare.gov website, as Republicans press for details about the botched October 1 launch that prevented millions of Americans from signing up for new insurance plans. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said it had added dozens of technology experts and engineers to its round-the-clock effort to fix the technical glitches on the site that is key to the implementation of President Barack Obama’s healthcare restructuring law. Giving some of the first details of who might be leading the tech fix, HHS officials identified two experts by name: Michael Dickerson, a website reliability engineer on leave from Google, and Greg Gershman, a Baltimore-based innovation director with the firm Mobomo and who previously worked for the White House and the General Services Administration. “We are doing everything we can to assist those contractors to make HealthCare.gov a highly performant, highly reliable, highly secure system.” Oracle CEO Larry Ellison told shareholders at the company’s annual meeting on Thursday in Redwood City, California. The administration says it is confident it will have the website running smoothly by November 30, giving people enough time to enroll in health plans to receive coverage beginning on January 1. Failure to do so would jeopardize its goal of signing up enough consumers, particularly young and healthy ones, to the new online insurance exchanges, and would provide new ammunition to Republican efforts to delay or kill the 2010 law. Representative Darrell Issa, Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said on Thursday he had subpoenaed HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius for information on the website’s technical problems. An earlier request for the documents was made on October 10. The details sought include how HealthCare.gov was tested and the number of people who have enrolled in insurance plans, as well as the number who have attempted to enroll. The subpoena requires the documents to be produced by November 13. “The evidence is mounting that the website did not go through proper testing, including critical security testing, and that the administration ignored repeated warnings from contractors about ongoing problems,” Issa said in a statement. Another House panel, the Energy and Commerce Committee, also sent letters to Sebelius as well as four contractors involved on the website, requesting documents about security testing, a committee statement said. HealthCare.gov is intended to serve Americans in 36 states, helping them determine eligibility for tax credits to buy private health insurance and sign up for coverage. The remaining 14 states have set up their own online exchanges, many of which have operated relatively smoothly since the rollout. The administration has launched what it calls a “tech surge” to fix the website’s problems, largely centered on two existing contractors who were paid to build its underlying technology - CGI Federal and Quality Software Services Inc, a unit of UnitedHealth Group. The contractors already were using technology from Oracle in building the site. Experts from Red Hat Inc are also among the repair effort, a U.S. official said on Thursday. Individuals from Oracle and Red Hat have expertise in site reliability, stability and scalability, according to a blog post by Julie Bataille, spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, which is overseeing the effort. But some observers are skeptical. Howard Anderson, a lecturer at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, said that he does not believe that bringing in a large number of experts will necessarily solve the problem. “What I am seeing is the equivalent of a man-overboard drill. It is the equivalent of having an infinite number of monkeys on an infinite number of code-making machines,” said Anderson, who advises executives at Fortune 500 corporations on information technology strategy. “They have made some interesting promises about how this thing is going to get fixed, but they actually really don’t know,” he said. In an embarrassment to Sebelius, HealthCare.gov was not fully functional for much of Wednesday as she testified before a House oversight committee about its problems.

95,ORCL,UPDATE 2-Oracle shareholders give Ellison's pay a thumbs down,"By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - A majority of shareholders opposed Oracle Corp Chief Executive Larry Ellison’s pay in a non-binding vote on Thursday following complaints that the world’s third-richest man makes too much as his company struggles against smaller rivals. The vote against Oracle’s executive compensation policy adds to a similar defeat at last year’s meeting, and while it requires no changes from the company, it underscores concern among shareholders about high pay in the face of lackluster financial performance. Challenges to the 69-year old Ellison’s pay package come as the world’s No. 2 software maker, which he co-founded four decades ago, tries to fend off smaller, aggressive companies offering software and Internet-based products at prices that often undercut Oracle. Ellison owns about 25 percent of Oracle. A majority of shareholders voted in support of Oracle’s directors, including those on the board’s compensation committee - Bruce Chizen, George Conrades and Naomi Seligman. That vote was also non-binding. In an initial tally, more than 1 billion votes were cast in favor of Oracle’s executive compensation and more than 2 billion were against. Oracle said figures for the votes on board members were not yet available. Major investment advisory groups like CtW Investment Group, which advises union pension funds, had urged shareholders to vote against Oracle’s executive pay and the directors on the compensation committee. CtW estimated that excluding Ellison’s shares, close to 85 percent of voted shares were against Oracle’s executive pay. “The ball’s in their court,” said CtW analyst Michael Pryce-Jones. “They’ve had two consecutive years of defeats on say-on-pay and so far they’ve shown an absolute disregard for investor concerns on the issue.” Ellison gave up an annual cash bonus of $1.2 million for fiscal 2013, which ended in May, after Oracle missed growth targets and his annual salary is a token $1. But he took home stock options value at about $77 million. Oracle’s revenue failed to grow in fiscal 2013 and its net profit grew 3.5 percent during that time. During that 12-month period, Oracle’s stock rose 27.5 percent, compared to a 24 percent increase in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index. Last year, Oracle’s pay for top executives won support from just 41 percent of votes cast. Oracle said its executive compensation is aimed at driving financial performance and the company’s long-term stock price. “Our existing executive compensation program achieves an appropriate balance between encouraging our senior executives to take actions that are consistent with our business strategy ... and discouraging executives from taking inappropriate or unnecessary risks,” Chairman Jeffrey Henley said after the vote. CtW has complained that Oracle’s executive pay far exceeds technology peers like International Business Machines Corp  and Cisco Systems Inc. Institutional Shareholder Services, the largest advisor for institutional investors, had also recommended a vote against the company’s executive pay and eight of Oracle’s 11 board members, saying board members failed to effectively oversee management in areas like executive pay. Rival proxy advisor Glass, Lewis & Co has also recommended votes “against” Oracle’s executive pay and “withhold” votes against five directors. Over the past 12 months, Oracle’s stock has gained 9 percent compared to the S&P; 500’s rise of 25 percent. On Thursday, Oracle’s stock was up 0.45 percent at $33.68.",10312013,http://www.reuters.com/article/oracle-shareholders/update-2-oracle-shareholders-give-ellisons-pay-a-thumbs-down-idUSL1N0IL1I720131031

All board members received majority votes by wide margins except for the members of the compensation committee - Bruce Chizen, George Conrades and Naomi Seligman - who each won re-election with margins of about 53 percent or less, including non-voted shares, according to a filing on Friday. At Oracle’s shareholders meeting on Thursday, a majority opposed the company’s executive compensation policy but supported the board of directors in separate votes. At the time, Oracle gave a tally for the vote on compensation but did not provide figures for votes on individual board members. All the votes were symbolic, but the close vote on the three directors underscored growing discontent over what some investors call inflated pay packages.

100,ORCL,UPDATE 1-Juniper appoints Barclays executive Shaygan Kheradpir CEO,"Nov 13 (Reuters) - Network gear maker Juniper Networks Inc  named Barclays Plc’s chief operations and technology officer, Shaygan Kheradpir, as successor to Chief Executive Kevin Johnson. Kheradpir joined Barclays in January 2011. Before that, he was executive vice president and chief information and technical officer at Verizon Communications Inc. Analysts said Kheradpir’s appointment indicates Juniper is likely to focus more on software-based networking and services. “We expect Mr. Kheradpir to sharpen Juniper’s focus in Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) given investor skepticism around the company’s strategy in this area,” Wedbush Securities analysts wrote in a note. Some of the world’s biggest technology companies, such as Cisco Systems Inc, Oracle Corp and Microsoft Corp have been investing in SDN, a technology that allows users to substitute some of the most complex hardware functions in server switches with software. Juniper acquired SDN firm Contrail Systems for $176 million in December. NFV separates network functions like caching from hardware appliances so they can run in software. Kheradpir was instrumental in several key initiatives at Verizon such as FiOS, interactive TV, high-speed data and carrier-grade VoIP, UBS analyst Amitabh Passi said. Verizon’s fiber optic service (FiOS) bundles televesion, Internet and telephony services. Kheradpir will take up his new job on Jan. 1, Juniper said on Wednesday. Barclays’ head of compliance and regulation, Hector Sants, also resigned from the British bank on Wednesday. Johnson, who has been CEO since September 2008, said in July he would retire once a successor was found.

102,ORCL,UPDATE 1-European Factors to Watch-Stocks to fall on prospect of early Fed taper,"LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - European stocks are set to open lower on Thursday, with the probable nomination of a relatively hawkish central banker to the U.S. Federal Reserve vice-chair adding to the view that the U.S. may slow its monetary stimulus sooner than previously thought. Former Bank of Israel governor Stanley Fischer has been asked to be the Federal Reserve’s next vice chair, a source familiar with the issue said on Wednesday, and is seen as less dovish than the nominee for chair of the bank, Janet Yellen. In particular, he is not an advocate of extending the Fed’s “forward guidance” that interest rates could be lower for even longer than previously expected. The Fed holds a policy meeting next week. “Reports that Stanley Fischer potentially being nominated for the Vice-chair of the Fed could (also) be having an impact, given he has said before that he opposes adjusting the Fed’s forward guidance,” Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG, said in a note. The news came late on a day where U.S. stocks posted their largest drop in a month on Wednesday after a provisional budget deal out of Washington removed one near-term reason for the Fed to keep up its current pace of economic stimulus. Asian shares also suffered on these “tapering” concerns. While European shares opened on Wednesday stronger after the budget deal, they gave away those gains by the end of the day, as the removal of uncertainty over fiscal policy was counteracted by this view of a potentially tighter monetary outlook. The FTSEurofirst 300 was down 0.5 percent at 1,256.32 points at the close after Wall Street opened lower, and the U.S. extended losses after the market close in Europe. “European markets should find reasonable selling as they price in a U.S. market that closed on its low,” IG’s Weston said. At 0720 GMT, futures for the Euro STOXX 50, Britain’s FTSE 100 , Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC were 0.3 percent - 0.5 percent lower. U.S. retail sales and initial jobless claims data will be in focus on Thursday, with traders saying a set of strong numbers could harden the view that the Fed could begin a taper of its asset purchases - known as quantitative easing (QE) - as early as its policy meeting next week. “The jury is still out as to whether the announcement to start the tapering of QE will be made then, but arguably it’s the uncertainty that’s eating into markets right now,” Patrick Latchford at Monex Capital Markets said. “There are also suggestions that agreement on Capitol Hill over the Federal Budget... is adding weight to the argument for swift action.” ————————————————————————————————————————   > Asian shares ease to 2-1/2 month low on Fed tapering anxiety       > Fed taper anxiety triggers profit taking on Wall St           > Nikkei falls 1.4 pct as index heavyweights drag on Fed concern       > TREASURIES-Prices fall ahead of 30-year bond supply            > Yen’s respite proves short-lived with Fed in focus            > Gold ticks up on weaker equities; technical support helps        > Copper eases from 1-mth high; tight physical supply supports       > Brent edges down towards $109 on tapering concerns German retailer Metro said it aimed for a significant improvement in profitability for 2013/14 as a restructuring plan starts to deliver after meeting its own guidance for operating earnings for the first nine months of 2013. British energy services company Wood Group said on Thursday it expected to meet forecasts for 2013 growth, but warned that profits from its engineering division would be down by between 10 and 15 percent next year due to continuing weakness in Canada. Britain’s biggest sporting goods retailer Sports Direct posted a strong rise in first-half profit and said it remained on the hunt for further expansion opportunities in Europe. Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank bought big stakes in Portugal’s CTT , the newly privatised postal services company said on Wednesday, as its shareholder structure began to be disclosed.

103,ORCL,Exclusive: Hellman & Friedman looks to sell HR software firm Kronos - sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firms Hellman & Friedman LLC and JMI Equity are exploring a sale of human resources management software firm Kronos Inc, which could be valued at more than $4 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Kronos is in early-stage talks with a small group of private equity firms, including KKR & Co LP, TPG Capital LP and Bain Capital LLC, about a potential deal, the people said. Oracle Corp and SAP AG would be natural buyers for Kronos but have so far shown little interest, the people added. Hellman and Friedman is working with Morgan Stanley on the sale of Kronos, which has annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of around $350 million, two of the people said. The sources asked not to be identified because the sale process is confidential. Hellman & Friedman, Morgan Stanley, KKR, TPG and Bain declined to comment while representatives of Kronos, JMI Equity, Oracle and SAP did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Chelmsford, Massachusetts-based Kronos provides workforce management solutions to companies and organizations in more than 100 countries. Hellman & Friedman, together with smaller private equity firm JMI Equity, took Kronos private in 2007 for $1.8 billion. The two private equity firms also teamed up last month to buy insurance software provider Applied Systems from Bain for $1.8 billion. In 2010, they sold another insurance software firm, Vertafore, to TPG for $1.4 billion. Hellman & Friedman and JMI have taken advantage of Kronos’ strong cash flow to draw more than $1.5 billion in dividends from the company, and so have already earned twice the $752.9 million they committed as equity when they agreed to acquire the company in 2007. Most recently, they had the company borrow last month to pay themselves a $490 million dividend, according to Moody’s Investors Service Inc. Kronos has a large and diversified base of enterprise clients and its recurring maintenance and subscription model has contributed to sustained growth in its revenue and EBITDA, Moody’s commented last month.

104,ORCL,Oracle's quarterly results top Wall Street expectations,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oracle Corp gave a quarterly report on Wednesday that created cautious hope of recovery in the software maker’s growth. The No. 2 software maker has been hurt by weak global IT spending and a move by some of its customers to less expensive software offered by rivals. But the company posted fiscal-second-quarter results that exceeded expectations, while its outlook for third-quarter earnings was in line with Wall Street estimates. The four-decade-old company missed analysts’ estimates for revenue in the three quarters prior to Wednesday’s report. “Given what we’ve been seeing in the last year I would call this a relief. Expectations were pretty negative going in,” said FBR analyst Daniel Ives. “All the ingredients or the recipes for success are out there, in terms of a ramped-up sales force and cloud business, and the key now is execution on their strategy.” Smaller, aggressive companies like Salesforce.com and Workday have been offering competitive software and Internet-based products at prices that often undercut Oracle, whose strategy is to integrate software with its own high-end, expensive hardware for greater efficiency. In response, Oracle has been rolling out its own cloud-based products while President Mark Hurd has hired new sales people and created sales teams aimed at going after specific cloud competitors. “That’s all they think about every day, is competing against every Workday prospect,” CEO Larry Ellison said on a conference call with analysts. “We have another team of people that compete against Salesforce.” With Oracle’s stock up about 4 percent year to date compared to a 27 percent increase in the S&P; 500, a majority of shareholders have expressed disapproval of Ellison’s pay package, which critics say is too generous. Next year may be tough for companies selling IT equipment to governments and companies. Global spending on servers, storage and enterprise networks is likely to grow 4 percent next year, after increasing just 1 percent in 2013, according to market research firm IDC. Oracle plans to compete aggressively against rivals offering cloud-based technology infrastructure services, like Amazon.com and Rackspace, Ellison said. “We’re going to be cost competitive and price competitive at the infrastructure level while being highly differentiated at both the platform level and the application level,” he said. Chief Financial Officer Safra Catz said that current-quarter revenue would grow between 3 percent and 7 percent in constant dollars, equivalent to between $9.2 billion and $9.6 billion. She said she expects current quarter EPS between 68 cents and 72 cents. Analysts expected revenue of $9.351 billion and EPS of 70 cents for the current quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For the second quarter, Oracle said overall revenue rose 2 percent to $9.3 billion. That was above the $9.2 billion analysts had expected on average. Net income fell to $2.6 billion, down 1 percent. GAP EPS rose 5 percent to 56 cents. On an adjusted basis, Oracle earned 69 cents per share. Analysts expected second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 67 cents. The company reported a 1 percent decrease in new software sales and Internet-based software subscriptions for the quarter. Investors scrutinize new software sales because they generate high-margin, long-term maintenance contracts and are an important indicator of future profit. For the current quarter, new software and sales and subscriptions will grow between 2 percent and 12 percent, Catz said. Revenue from Oracle’s hardware systems products, which it acquired through the $5.6 billion purchase of Sun Microsystems in 2010, fell 3 percent to $714 million in the second quarter. Oracle’s hardware revenue has fallen since it bought Sun, with Ellison saying much of that decline is due to phasing out older low-margin systems in favor Oracle’s premium hardware. For the current quarter, hardware product revenue will be in a range between down 1 percent and up 9 percent, the company said. Shares of Oracle were up 0.9 percent in after-hours trade at $34.11.

Wednesday’s rally came after the Federal Reserve announced a plan to trim its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion to $75 billion beginning in January. The statement was accompanied by a dovish indication of rock-bottom interest rates for the foreseeable future, a combination that gave the Dow and the S&P; 500 their largest daily gains in two months. Despite that, trading volume has been below average, with many investors having locked in their gains for the year ahead of the coming holidays. “There’s a lot of transparency in the market, but most of the noise has been made,” said Mark Martiak, senior wealth strategist at Premier Wealth/First Allied Securities in New York. “We should expect to continue seeing light volume and not much selling.” The Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.22 points, or 0.01 percent, at 16,169.19. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was down 2.32 points, or 0.13 percent, at 1,808.33. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 12.70 points, or 0.31 percent, at 4,057.37. The S&P; 500 was only a few points away from its all-time high of 1,813.55, while the Dow reached an all-time intraday high earlier in the session. Oracle jumped 6.6 percent to $36.87 a day after the software maker reported earnings that beat expectations and gave a bullish revenue outlook. Facebook fell 0.9 percent to $55.07 after the social network company announced the offering of 70 million shares, including more than 41 million shares from Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg worth about $2.3 billion. Zuckerberg’s sale, partly to pay a tax bill, will reduce his voting power to 56.1 percent from 58.8 percent. Target Corp said hackers might have stolen data from some 40 million credit and debit cards of shoppers who visited its stores during the first three weeks of the holiday season in the second-largest such breach reported by a U.S. retailer.  The stock slid 2.2 percent to $62.16. Dish is considering a bid for T-Mobile US  next year, according to people close to the matter, in what would be the satellite TV provider’s second attempt at acquiring a major wireless operator. Dish shares rose 1 percent to $55.85, while T-Mobile gained 7.5 percent to $29.30. Darden Restaurants said it would sell or spin off its Red Lobster business, buckling under pressure from activist investor Barington Capital Group after reporting another quarter of sliding profits. Darden shares dropped 5.1 percent to $50.22.

115,ORCL,America's Cup regatta may return to San Francisco in 2017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oracle Team USA wants to stage the next America’s Cup regatta in San Francisco in August 2017 in catamarans smaller than the one they sailed to victory last summer, team CEO Russell Coutts told Reuters on Monday. Oracle Corp CEO Larry Ellison’s team notched eight successive wins over Team New Zealand in September, coming from behind to take the 34th America’s Cup in one of the sport’s most remarkable comebacks. The event’s victor wins the right to choose the venue. Coutts wants to return the regatta to the Northern California city’s waterfront, and hopes to convince civic leaders to agree to host the event a second time. San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee on Monday sent a letter to Coutts opening negotiations. The city and Oracle have a number of details to sort out and the board of supervisors must approve any deal. Numerous hurdles remain before Ellison can reach an agreement with the city, including convincing critics of the economic benefits for the city, which turned out less than initially estimated. Some supervisors criticized the last arrangement between the city and Ellison as being too generous to the event organizers. But “the 34th America’s Cup generated hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity for San Francisco, created thousands of jobs and showcased our spectacular waterfront, the beauty of San Francisco Bay and the sport of sailing to millions of spectators around the world,” Lee wrote in his letter. Yet controversy dogged this year’s event. Critics questioned the safety of the faster, high-tech 72-foot catamarans sailed in the last America’s Cup, particularly after a sailor died in a tragic accident. “Some people within the city are saying why should we support a race for a billionaire like Larry Ellison,” Coutts said. “Most people have recognized that it was more about highly skilled, young athletes than it was about billionaires.” San Francisco and Ellison hope to finalize an agreement by March 1, Lee said in his letter. Coutts expects the next series of races for the world’s oldest sporting trophy to be sailed in twin-hulled yachts between 60 and 65 feet long (18 and 20 meter), with hydrofoils to lift the hulls out of the water onto carbon-fiber blades. “It will be a foiling catamaran for sure,” Coutts said in a telephone interview. Coutts said the Australian challenger of record, led by winemakers Bob and Sandy Oatley, and Oracle have hired an entity to design the rules for the next Cup. To reduce costs, he said they are considering shrinking the number of crew members from 11 to eight. They also are considering re-imposing a nationality rule, Coutts said. Just one member of this year’s winning American team hailed from the United States. The races leading up to the final series last summer lasted months. Next time, Coutts said, he plans to consolidate the races into just one month in August 2017. That month was the best time to stage the event in San Francisco’s cruise ship terminal because cruise ships rarely dock in San Francisco in August, Coutts said.

Coutts wants to return the regatta to the Northern California city’s waterfront, and hopes to convince civic leaders to agree to host the event a second time. San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee on Monday sent a letter to Coutts opening negotiations. The city and Oracle have a number of details to sort out and the board of supervisors must approve any deal. Numerous hurdles remain before Ellison can reach an agreement with the city, including convincing critics of the economic benefits for the city, which turned out less than initially estimated. Some supervisors criticized the last arrangement between the city and Ellison as being too generous to the event organizers. But “the 34th America’s Cup generated hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity for San Francisco, created thousands of jobs and showcased our spectacular waterfront, the beauty of San Francisco Bay and the sport of sailing to millions of spectators around the world,” Lee wrote in his letter. Yet controversy dogged this year’s event. Critics questioned the safety of the faster, high-tech 72-foot catamarans sailed in the last America’s Cup, particularly after a sailor died in a tragic accident. “Some people within the city are saying why should we support a race for a billionaire like Larry Ellison,” Coutts said. “Most people have recognized that it was more about highly skilled, young athletes than it was about billionaires.” San Francisco and Ellison hope to finalize an agreement by March 1, Lee said in his letter. Coutts expects the next series of races for the world’s oldest sporting trophy to be sailed in twin-hulled yachts between 60 and 65 feet long (18 and 20 meter), with hydrofoils to lift the hulls out of the water onto carbon-fiber blades. “It will be a foiling catamaran for sure,” Coutts said in a telephone interview. Coutts said the Australian challenger of record, led by winemakers Bob and Sandy Oatley, and Oracle have hired an entity to design the rules for the next Cup. To reduce costs, he said they are considering shrinking the number of crew members from 11 to eight. They also are considering re-imposing a nationality rule, Coutts said. Just one member of this year’s winning American team hailed from the United States. The races leading up to the final series last summer lasted months. Next time, Coutts said, he plans to consolidate the races into just one month in August 2017. That month was the best time to stage the event in San Francisco’s cruise ship terminal because cruise ships rarely dock in San Francisco in August, Coutts said.",12242013,http://www.reuters.com/article/sailing-americascup/americas-cup-regatta-may-return-to-san-francisco-in-2017-idUSL2N0K303U20131224
117,ORCL,"COLUMN-The Oracle Oregon fiasco, crying wolf on an Obamacare tax, and anointing the 'Politico 50'","(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Steven Brill Dec 31 (Reuters) - (This is the latest installment of Steven Brill’s weekly column, “Stories I’d Like to See.”) 1. The Oracle Oregon fiasco: We all know by now that the dominant story line of the Obamacare website’s failed launch is that the federal government is terrible at doing high-tech projects - let alone one that involves the e-commerce wizardry that has made Silicon Valley the envy of the world. But it turns out that one state exchange to sell Obamacare insurance plans has had an even more disastrous launch than the 36-state HealthCare.gov. It’s CoverOregon.com - the website for the Oregon exchange. In fact, as the Associated Press notes, last week state officials cancelled an advertising campaign to get people to sign up at CoverOregon.com because the website still isn’t up and running. But Oregon didn’t rely on a bunch of bureaucrats to supervise its launch. Far from it. The state farmed the entire project out to  drumroll  Oracle, one of the crown jewels of hi-tech America. The company’s chief executive officer, Larry Ellison, perpetually appears near the top of the Forbes 400 list (he’s number three this year) and was eagerly available to the press when he financed his successful America’s Cup entry last fall, at the same time that the website was supposedly being finished. Nick Budnick of the Oregonian has been all over this story, but the Oregon/Oracle fiasco has escaped the national attention it deserves. And Budnick has been unable to get Oracle to provide any comment. It’s time for the national press to trail Ellison and ask him what happened and what he’s going to do about it.  2. Crying wolf on an Obamacare tax: One mechanism that Congress deployed to pay for the subsidies given the poor and middle class to help them buy health insurance under Obamacare is an excise tax of 2.3 percent on all medical devices, such as artificial hips or pacemakers. The rationale was that with its humongous profit margins, the $136 billion industry (we spend more every year in the United States just on artificial hips and knees than Hollywood takes in at the box office) could easily afford the tax. Moreover, the industry would simply be paying back a portion of the extra profits it would enjoy from all the new customers who received health insurance coverage under Obamacare. Nonetheless, from the moment the tax was considered by Congress in 2009, the device makers and their army of lobbyists howled that it would stifle innovation, increase costs and otherwise ruin an industry that claimed responsibility for 422,000 jobs. The tax survived the lobbying onslaught, primarily because Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) insisted on keeping it. But the lobbying has continued, and the odds are now good that the lobbyists will finally prevail. Among the measures now being discussed on Capitol Hill to repeal, curtail or amend Obamacare, getting rid of the device tax seems to be gathering the most bipartisan support. The device tax took effect last January. So, it’s time for someone to cut through the rhetoric that repeal is needed to save the industry and look into just how much damage, if any, the tax has done. The hardship pleas are coming not just from usual-suspect Republicans but also from Democratic members of Congress who represent states where the industry is headquartered, such as Senator Al Franken of Minnesota. Yet a quick look at the results reported recently for the industry’s leading company - Medtronic, Inc., based in Franken’s home state - shows no sign of the carnage predicted by the lobbyists and their congressional sympathizers. Net earnings for Medtronic’s fiscal quarter ending on October 25, 2013 were up 40 percent over the prior year, to $902 million on revenue of $4.2 billion (producing a net profit margin of 21 percent, astounding for a manufacturing company). With repeal of the device tax likely to be a hot topic this winter, it’s time for the financial and political press to dig deeper to see where the beef is behind the industry’s beef.  3. Anointing the “Politico 50” PAC moguls: As the 2014 election season approaches, we keep reading articles like the one in the New York Times last week, “Upstart Groups Challenge Rove for GOP Cash,” which speculate on the fight among professional political strategists and media buyers to raise funds. Even House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and others have charged that some of the groups fomenting conservative attacks on the more moderate Republicans are doing it because it helps them raise money for PACs and SuperPACs that they can then control and draw fees from. With all of that in mind, I wish Fortune, Bloomberg Businessweek or maybe Politico would assign a team to produce something like the Fortune 500 for the highest-earning political consultants. Maybe it could be called the Politico 50. Who are the consultants, fund-raisers or media buyers - on both sides of the aisle, and among conservatives as well as unions and other liberal groups - who have built up the biggest money machines? In the age of PACs and SuperPACs and their “non-profit” sister spinoffs, who are the biggest individual earners? Who has turned the sweepstakes into the most lucrative family business, with spouses, relatives and other offspring on the payroll?

118,ORCL,Oracle's Ellison downplays threat of NSA database snooping,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oracle Corp CEO Larry Ellison played down concerns on Wednesday about possible government snooping in his business customers’ private data. At an industry conference in San Francisco, an audience member asked the Oracle co-founder what to tell potential Oracle cloud-computing clients who worry that the National Security Agency could access their information. “To the best of our knowledge, an Oracle database hasn’t been broken into for a couple of decades by anybody,” Ellison replied. “It’s so secure, there are people that complain,” he added. Oracle, Salesforce.com and other major Silicon Valley companies are increasingly offering Internet-based business services for things like human resources, accounting and sales management, in a trend known as cloud computing. Entrusting software and data management to cloud services can save companies the expense of maintaining their own servers and other IT infrastructure. Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden’s revelations about U.S. government surveillance have increased companies’ concerns about privacy and may cost U.S. technology vendors billions of dollars in lost sales, analysts say. David Litchfield, an established security expert and frequent speaker at top hacking conferences, disagreed with Ellison’s comments and said he regularly sees Oracle systems being compromised. “Of all of the commercial databases, Oracle is the least secure,” he told Reuters by email. The roots of Ellison’s software company go back to 1977, when the Central Intelligence Agency contracted him and two co-workers to design a database, codenamed Oracle. The same year, Ellison and his colleagues founded the database company that would eventually be renamed Oracle. In an interview with CBS News’ Charlie Rose in August, Ellison said he believed the NSA’s widespread surveillance was essential to preventing terrorism.

124,ORCL,UPDATE 4-Oracle quarterly results disappoint Wall St; shares fall,"(Adds details from call, analyst’s comment) By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, March 18 (Reuters) - Oracle Corp  posted higher third-quarter revenue and profit that failed to satisfy investors looking for signs of a sustained turnaround and its shares fell about 4 percent. Shareholders had grown more optimistic after Oracle’s previous quarterly results, but still worried about slow IT spending and growing competition from smaller, nimble rivals. On Tuesday, the company also forecast current-quarter results roughly in line with investors’ targets. Chief Financial Officer Safra Catz forecast fourth-quarter revenue growth of between 3 percent and 7 percent in constant dollars, equivalent to between $11.3 billion and $11.7 billion. Wall Street had expected $11.5 billion. She told analysts on a conference call that she expected current quarter earnings of 92 cents to 99 cents per share, versus analysts’ consensus estimate of about 96 cents. New software and sales and subscriptions should grow between zero and 10 percent, she said. “They still have heavy lifting ahead in order to declare this a turnaround story,” said Dan Ives, an analyst with FBR. “Investors need to see more. It continues to be a ‘prove me’ stock in the eyes of investors.” The company said new software sales and Internet-based software subscriptions in its fiscal third quarter ended Feb. 28 rose 4 percent from the year-ago period. The company had forecast that new software sales and subscriptions would be up between 2 percent and 12 percent in the current quarter. New software sales are scrutinized by investors because they generate high-margin, long-term maintenance contracts and are an important indicator of future profit. Revenue from Oracle’s hardware systems products grew 8 percent to $725 million, the first increase since the software company’s $5.6 billion purchase of Sun Microsystems in 2010. The hardware business recovery is a good sign but much less important than the company’s core software business, said Ives. Smaller, aggressive companies like Salesforce.com Inc  and Workday Inc have been offering competitive software and Internet-based products at prices that often undercut Oracle. In response, four-decade-old Oracle has been rolling out its own cloud-based products and acquiring smaller cloud companies like marketing software maker Responsys Inc. “They moved in this direction significantly later than Microsoft for example,” said Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler. “They’re playing catch up, but they’re working quickly and they’re starting to make some progress.” On Tuesday’s call, Catz said revenue from cloud software subscriptions was up by about 24 percent in the quarter to $292 million, equivalent to about 3 percent of Oracle’s total revenue. On the conference call, President Mark Hurd said Oracle is getting better at selling cloud services, thanks partly to a reorganization of the company’s salesforce last year. “We thought we knew a lot a year ago or a couple years ago. We just know a lot more now,” Hurd said. “We obviously have more feet on the street than we had and ... they’ve been in place longer.” Cloud computing, which refers to the delivery of services via the Internet from remote data centers, is becoming popular with corporate buyers because it is faster to implement and has lower upfront costs than traditional software. Most of Oracle’s business relies on selling database software and hardware that customers install in their own data centers. Customers pay extra maintenance contracts that are highly profitable to Oracle and provide a steady stream of cash. Global IT spending is likely to increase just 3 percent this year, while spending on cloud services is expected to grow 18 percent, according to market research firm Gartner. For the third quarter, Oracle said overall revenue rose 4 percent to $9.31 billion. That was a little below the $9.36 billion analysts had expected on average. Net income was $2.56 billion, up 2 percent. Earnings per share, which reflected a decrease in the number of shares outstanding, rose 8 percent to 56 cents. On an adjusted basis, Oracle earned 68 cents per share. Shares of Oracle fell 4 percent to $37.32 in extended trade, after closing at $38.84 on the New York Stock Exchange.

126,ORCL,Wall Street drops after Yellen moves up possible rate hike,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday after comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen raised the possibility of an earlier- than-anticipated increase in interest rates. The central bank dropped the U.S. unemployment rate as its definitive yardstick for gauging the economy’s strength and made clear it would rely on a wide range of measures in deciding when to raise interest rates. Equities extended declines after Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the “considerable period” between the end of its quantitative easing program, known as QE, and the first rate increase from the central bank could be six months. With QE forecast to wind down sometime near the end of the year, a six-month lag would move up the timetable for the Fed’s first hike, which many market participants had been expecting in the second half of 2015. “She certainly moved it up a little bit, and I don’t think the market was expecting that at all because she is widely viewed as being more on the dovish side of the aisle than she is on the hawkish side,” said Peter Kenny, CEO of Clearpool Group in New York. “That is not a particularly hawkish comment, but the fact of the matter is, it was not expected.” The Fed also said it would cut its monthly purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to $55 billion, from $65 billion. The S&P; 500 was within 1 percent of its record closing high, though economic bellwether FedEx Corp (FDX.N) hit a sour note in its outlook. Geopolitical concerns related to Ukraine also stayed in focus. FedEx posted results below expectations and gave a weak full-year profit forecast, but the package shipper said it had been significantly hurt by winter storms, and the stock slipped 0.1 percent to close at $138.38. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 114.02 points or 0.70 percent, to end at 16,222.17. The S&P; 500 .SPX slipped 11.48 points or 0.61 percent, to finish at 1,860.77. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 25.711 points or 0.59 percent, to close at 4,307.602. Equities had rallied to start the week, buoyed by easing geopolitical concerns, though trading volume has been light. The S&P; 500 .SPX has climbed 1.7 percent over the previous two days, the best back-to-back performance for the benchmark index since early February. First Solar Inc (FSLR.O) surged 20.6 percent to $69.40 and ranked as the S&P; 500’s best performer after the company forecast a rise of up to 21 percent in revenue this year. First Solar also said it was developing cost-effective solar plants with General Electric Co (GE.N). Volume was light, with about 6 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.7 billion average so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets. Volume is expected to surge on Friday as options expiration takes place alongside multiple index rebalances. Credit Suisse estimates $14 billion in gross trading will stem from the S&P; 500 index rebalance, with another $6 billion coming from rebalancing in other indexes. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the New York Stock Exchange by a ratio of 3 to 1. On the Nasdaq, nearly two stocks fell for every one that rose.

The company had forecast that new software sales and subscriptions would be up between 2 percent and 12 percent in the current quarter. New software sales are scrutinized by investors because they generate high-margin, long-term maintenance contracts and are an important indicator of future profit. Revenue from Oracle’s hardware systems products grew 8 percent to $725 million, the first increase since the software company’s $5.6 billion purchase of Sun Microsystems in 2010. The hardware business recovery is a good sign but much less important than the company’s core software business, said Ives. Smaller, aggressive companies like Salesforce.com Inc and Workday Inc have been offering competitive software and Internet-based products at prices that often undercut Oracle. In response, four-decade-old Oracle has been rolling out its own cloud-based products and acquiring smaller cloud companies like marketing software maker Responsys Inc. “They moved in this direction significantly later than Microsoft for example,” said Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler. “They’re playing catch up, but they’re working quickly and they’re starting to make some progress.” On Tuesday’s call, Catz said revenue from cloud software subscriptions was up by about 24 percent in the quarter to $292 million, equivalent to about 3 percent of Oracle’s total revenue. On the conference call, President Mark Hurd said Oracle is getting better at selling cloud services, thanks partly to a reorganization of the company’s salesforce last year. “We thought we knew a lot a year ago or a couple years ago. We just know a lot more now,” Hurd said. “We obviously have more feet on the street than we had and ... they’ve been in place longer.” Cloud computing, which refers to the delivery of services via the Internet from remote data centers, is becoming popular with corporate buyers because it is faster to implement and has lower upfront costs than traditional software. Most of Oracle’s business relies on selling database software and hardware that customers install in their own data centers. Customers pay extra maintenance contracts that are highly profitable to Oracle and provide a steady stream of cash. Global IT spending is likely to increase just 3 percent this year, while spending on cloud services is expected to grow 18 percent, according to market research firm Gartner. For the third quarter, Oracle said overall revenue rose 4 percent to $9.31 billion. That was a little below the $9.36 billion analysts had expected on average. Net income was $2.56 billion, up 2 percent. Earnings per share, which reflected a decrease in the number of shares outstanding, rose 8 percent to 56 cents. On an adjusted basis, Oracle earned 68 cents per share. Shares of Oracle fell 4 percent to $37.32 in extended trade, after closing at $38.84 on the New York Stock Exchange.

132,ORCL,"Tidemark wins $32 million funding to take on Oracle, SAP","SAN FRANCISCO, April 29 (Reuters) - Business-intelligence service Tidemark said it has raised another $32 million in funding to help it take on an area once dominated by companies like Oracle and SAP. The cash will help Redwood City, Calif.-based Tidemark develop its analytics tools, which take data created by business applications and put them in an easy-to-evaluate format. Business intelligence has evolved into a highly competitive market, with companies such as Tableau Software and fellow start-ups Domo and Birst offering services that take advantage of technological developments driven by the Internet. Like other new business-intelligence companies, Tidemark’s tools are cloud-based. That means they can be accessed from anywhere and come with more flexible terms compared with legacy analytics tools from companies such as Oracle and SAP. Its customers include video service Netflix, banana distributor Chiquita, and marketing service HubSpot. Silicon Valley Bank joined existing investors Greylock Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, Redpoint Ventures, and Tenaya Capital in the funding round, which brings Tidemark’s total funding to $80 million. The company last raised cash in August. The funding is all primary, meaning it will go directly to the company rather than to buy out employees and other existing investors, a spokeswoman said.

133,ORCL,Three Lawson Software founders settle SEC insider trading charges,"May 12 (Reuters) - Three Lawson Software Inc founders agreed to pay about $5.8 million to settle U.S. insider trading charges that they took advantage of incorrect media and analyst reports to trade stock ahead of the company’s 2011 merger. Monday’s accord resolves U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that former Co-Chairman Richard Lawson, 70, tipped his brother William Lawson, 72, and friend John Cerullo, 71, that the company was not the object of a bidding war, and that a lone bidder was offering less than the market price. The defendants did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. Lawson Software on March 14, 2011 announced it had received an unsolicited offer, which it later accepted, to be acquired by Infor Global Solutions and an affiliate of private equity firm Golden Gate Capital for about $1.8 billion, or $11.25 per share. According to the SEC, media and analyst reports, including from Reuters, were speculating at the time that suitors including Hewlett-Packard Co, International Business Machines Corp, Oracle Corp and SAP AG  might offer higher bids, but that Richard Lawson told his brother and Cerullo this was not the case. The SEC said William Lawson, a third party tipped by him and Cerullo together made over $2 million by selling more than 1.8 million shares at prices inflated by the speculation. It said that when a definitive $11.25 per share merger for Lawson Software was announced on April 26, 2011, the St. Paul, Minnesota-based company’s stock price fell 8.8 percent. “When news surfaces about the possibility of a merger and details of the media reports are incorrect, it is illegal for insiders who know the true facts to trade and profit,” Stephen Cohen, an associate director in the SEC enforcement division, said in a statement. In settling with the SEC, Richard Lawson agreed to pay a $1.56 million fine; William Lawson, who was once Lawson Software’s chief executive, agreed to pay $3.87 million, including a $1.85 million fine; and Cerullo agreed to pay about $373,000, including a roughly $178,000 fine. Charles Gall, a lawyer for Richard Lawson, declined to comment. Terrence Fleming, a lawyer for William Lawson, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

134,ORCL,Oracle faces scrutiny over $1.3 billion verdict against SAP,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court appeared skeptical on Tuesday about reinstating a $1.3 billion jury verdict won by Oracle Corp against SAP, in a case where the European software company admitted massive copyright infringement. At a court hearing on Tuesday, two 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judges also suggested Oracle may deserve more than the roughly $300 million it had been assigned by a lower court. A Northern California jury awarded Oracle $1.3 billion in 2010 over accusations that SAP AG subsidiary, TomorrowNow, wrongfully downloaded millions of Oracle files. SAP had acquired TomorrowNow as part of a strategy to provide software support to Oracle customers at lower rates than what Oracle charged, and eventually convince some of those companies to become SAP customers. The trial between the two enterprise software competitors was widely watched at the time, as top Oracle executives Larry Ellison and Safra Catz testified. However, U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton in Oakland, California ruled that Oracle had proven actual damages of only $272 million. Oracle has asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reverse that ruling. At a court hearing on Tuesday before a three-judge 9th Circuit panel, Oracle attorney Kathleen Sullivan said internal SAP documents showed SAP had expected about $900 million in new revenue by using TomorrowNow to poach Oracle customers. That, and other evidence, was sufficient for the jury to arrive at its $1.3 billion figure, Sullivan argued. However, 9th Circuit Judge Susan Graber questioned whether those SAP revenue figures were objective evidence of the value of the copyrighted material. “It’s hypothetical revenue information, which is not the same,” Graber said. “These may be pie in the sky dreaming,” Judge William Fletcher added. The judges did not issue a formal ruling from the bench. SAP eventually shuttered TomorrowNow, which pleaded guilty to criminal copyright infringement and other charges. SAP admitted liability for the downloads just prior to the 2010 trial, so the only issue in dispute was how much SAP would pay Oracle in damages. Oracle said that figure should be calculated based on what SAP would have paid Oracle had it licensed the materials, instead of downloading them without permission. Oracle estimated that amount in the billions. In her lower court ruling, however, Hamilton decided Oracle is only entitled to profits it had lost as a result of the downloads, as well as any profits SAP gained. The judge calculated that amount at $272 million. At the 9th Circuit hearing on Tuesday, Graber said $272 million “seems low,” and Fletcher said it “seems to me wrong.” SAP attorney Tharan “Greg” Lanier defended the amount, though he acknowledged that Oracle presented evidence at trial that the profits calculation could come to $487 million.

137,ORCL,Fitch Affirms Oracle at 'A+'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 16 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of Oracle Corp.  (Oracle) at 'A+', including the long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR). The  Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this  press release. The rating actions affect approximately $27 billion of total debt, including the  company's undrawn $3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF).  KEY RATING DRIVERS The Ratings and Outlook reflect: --Significant financial flexibility, with cash and investments totaling $37.2  billion as of Feb. 28, 2014, an undrawn $3 billion RCF due 2018 and sustained  annual free cash flow (FCF) after dividends in excess of $9 billion in the past  three fiscal years (FYs). Fitch projects FCF of nearly $12.5 billion in FY 2014,  compared with $12.1 billion in FY 2013 (ended May 31).  --Strong customer attach-and-renewal rates for software maintenance, resulting  in a steadily increasing, highly profitable (93% gross margin) recurring revenue  stream that significantly reduces FCF volatility.  --Strong competitive position, especially in database and middleware software. --Conservative financial policies and strong credit protection metrics, with  historical leverage peaking at 1.3x. Oracle's external financing requirements  were historically limited to acquisition funding due to strong internal cash  generation, staggered debt maturities and materially lower cash payments for  share repurchases and dividends prior to FY 2012. --Size and diversity with respect to its installed software base and significant  switching costs associated with mission-critical enterprise software. --Established track record of integrating acquisitions. Fitch's rating concerns are:  --Competition from open-source software and long-term profitability of Oracle's  software as a service (SaaS) relative to traditional on-premise software. In the  first nine months of fiscal 2014 (ended Feb. 28), the direct controllable margin  on new software licenses and cloud subscriptions (L&C;), excluding stock-based  compensation, declined to 26.2% from 31.2% in the year-ago period, despite  relatively flat new software license revenue. Fitch believes Oracle has and will continue to make significant investments,  both organic and inorganic, to retain its long-term competitiveness relative to  SaaS providers. Oracle's SaaS revenue was $1.1 billion, or more than 10%, of  total L&C; software revenue over the LTM ending February 28, compared with $823  million in the year-ago period. Cloud subscription revenue increased 24.2%  year-over-year to $287 million in the quarter ended Feb. 28, 2014. --Aggressive acquisition strategy; however, Fitch expects the company will  remain disciplined with its strategy and, in the event of a major debt-financed  acquisition, will reduce leverage using FCF in lieu of meaningful share  repurchases. --Material and sustained growth in cash returned to shareholders via stock  repurchases and dividends since fiscal 2012 as well as U.S. acquisitions  increase Oracle's external U.S. funding requirements due to significant offshore  cash and FCF generation that is subject to incremental taxation upon  repatriation. As of Feb 28, 2014, $32.9 billion, or 88%, of Oracle's total cash  and investments of $37.2 billion was held offshore.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive:  Fitch believes the company's lack of a strategic rationale to maintain a higher  rating at the expense of financial flexibility required for acquisitions limits  further positive rating actions. Negative: --A shift to more aggressive financial policies, including a material sustained  increase in leverage;  --Inability to adapt to major technology transitions, such as SaaS or any  emerging database technologies. Fitch believes Oracle's liquidity is strong, supported by a sizable cash  position, the vast majority of which is held offshore, an undrawn $3 billion RCF  due April 2018, and strong and consistent FCF. The significant offshore cash  position is attributable to a considerable portion of FCF being derived outside  the U.S., while significant funding is required in the U.S. for share  repurchases, acquisitions and dividends.  Oracle's credit protection metrics remained relatively stable in the past year.  Leverage (debt/operating EBITDA) increased to 1.3x as of Feb. 28, 2014 compared  with 1.1x in the year-ago period, while interest coverage (operating  EBITDA/interest expense) was decreased to 20.1x compared with 23.1x in the  year-ago period. Fitch forecasts leverage below 1.3x and interest coverage in  excess of 20x in fiscal 2015. As of Feb. 28, 2014, total debt was $24.2 billion and consisted primarily of: --$1.5 billion of 3.75% senior notes due July 2014; --$2 billion of 5.25% senior notes due January 2016; --$2.5 billion of 1.20% senior notes due October 2017; --$2.5 billion of 5.75% senior notes due April 2018; --$500 million of floating rate senior notes due January 2019; --$1.5 billion of 2.375% senior notes due January 2019; --$1.75 billion of 5% senior notes due July 2019; --$1 billion of 3.875% senior notes due July 2020; --$1.62 billion of 2.25% senior notes due January 2021; --$2.5 billion of 2.50% senior notes due October 2022; --$1 billion of 3.625% senior notes due July 2023; --$975 million of 3.125% senior notes due July 2025; --$1.25 billion of 6.50% senior notes due April 2038; --$1.25 billion of 6.125% senior notes due July 2039; --$2.23 billion of 5.375% senior notes due July 2040. Fitch affirms Oracle's ratings as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+'; --Revolving credit facility 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'.

140,ORCL,Oregon governor seeks lawsuit over health exchange website debacle,"PORTLAND Ore. (Reuters) - Oregon’s Democratic governor wants the state’s attorney general to sue the technology vendor that developed the embattled Cover Oregon website to recover payments, while officials from Oracle said on Friday any claims were unfounded.  A state that fully embraced the Affordable Care Act, Oregon endured one of the rockiest rollouts of President Barack Obama’s healthcare law, requiring tens of thousands of applicants to use paper forms since launching on Oct. 1. The state decided in April to move the troubled state exchange to the federal system. The announcement by Governor John Kitzhaber seeking legal action comes as federal prosecutors have subpoenaed documents from Oregon’s health exchange agency as part of a grand jury investigation into how the state used federal money to set up the now-failed health insurance exchange.  “The time has come to hold Oracle accountable for its failure to deliver technology that worked on the timelines the company committed to,” Kitzhaber said in a statement on Thursday. “Today I have asked Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum to immediately initiate legal action to recover payments and other damages from Oracle.”  “Oracle did not deliver,” Kitzhaber said. “The poor quality of its work is obvious in the many bugs that are still not fixed, in missed deadlines (and) in the fundamental flaws in the system’s architecture.” Oracle Corp., which the state paid about $134 million, defended its work and called Kitzhaber’s move political.  “OHA and Cover Oregon were in charge and badly mismanaged the project by consistently failing to deliver requirements in a timely manner and failing to staff the project with skilled personnel,” company officials said in a statement.  “We understand the political nature of the announcement just made and that the governor wants to shift blame from where it belongs. We look forward to an investigation that we are confident will completely exonerate Oracle.” Several Cover Oregon officials, including two past directors, have resigned in recent months amid an independent investigation ordered by the governor’s office that found mismanagement and a failure to report problems from the start. The state has received roughly $300 million in federal grants and paid Oracle to create technology for the website. Federal prosecutors have also asked for all purchase orders, invoicing and statements of work by Oracle. Rosenblum’s office released a letter sent to Kitzhaber saying her office was exploring legal options.  “I share your determination to recover every dollar to which Oregon is entitled,” Rosenblum said.  Kitzhaber, who is up for re-election in November against Republican challenger Dennis Richardson, also made requests to the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to evaluate Oracle’s work and to “consider the full range of legal options.”  ",5302014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-oregon/oregon-governor-seeks-lawsuit-over-health-exchange-website-debacle-idUSKBN0EA25B20140530

The announcement by Governor John Kitzhaber seeking legal action comes as federal prosecutors have subpoenaed documents from Oregon’s health exchange agency as part of a grand jury investigation into how the state used federal money to set up the now-failed health insurance exchange. “The time has come to hold Oracle accountable for its failure to deliver technology that worked on the timelines the company committed to,” Kitzhaber said in a statement on Thursday. “Today I have asked Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum to immediately initiate legal action to recover payments and other damages from Oracle.” “Oracle did not deliver,” Kitzhaber said. “The poor quality of its work is obvious in the many bugs that are still not fixed, in missed deadlines (and) in the fundamental flaws in the system’s architecture.” Oracle Corp., which the state paid about $134 million, defended its work and called Kitzhaber’s move political. “OHA and Cover Oregon were in charge and badly mismanaged the project by consistently failing to deliver requirements in a timely manner and failing to staff the project with skilled personnel,” company officials said in a statement. “We understand the political nature of the announcement just made and that the governor wants to shift blame from where it belongs. We look forward to an investigation that we are confident will completely exonerate Oracle.” Several Cover Oregon officials, including two past directors, have resigned in recent months amid an independent investigation ordered by the governor’s office that found mismanagement and a failure to report problems from the start. The state has received roughly $300 million in federal grants and paid Oracle to create technology for the website. Federal prosecutors have also asked for all purchase orders, invoicing and statements of work by Oracle. Rosenblum’s office released a letter sent to Kitzhaber saying her office was exploring legal options. “I share your determination to recover every dollar to which Oregon is entitled,” Rosenblum said. Kitzhaber, who is up for re-election in November against Republican challenger Dennis Richardson, also made requests to the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to evaluate Oracle’s work and to “consider the full range of legal options.”    (Editing by Cynthia Johnston and Chris Reese)",5302014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-healthcare-oregon/oregon-governor-seeks-lawsuit-over-health-exchange-website-debacle-idUSL1N0OG1T820140530
142,ORCL,Oracle's Ellison debuts technology for faster databases,"REDWOOD CITY California (Reuters) - Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) Chief Executive Larry Ellison on Tuesday launched “in-memory” technology for speeding up data analysis in a bid to beef up demand for his company’s software products. The in-memory features, which Oracle has been talking about for months, allow for faster database queries and transactions as companies collect, store and analyze growing amounts of information across the Internet.  The technology will go on sale in July as an add-on to Oracle’s existing databases, Ellison said at an event at the company’s headquarters. “It’s the ability to run most of your data, all the data you frequently access, in memory and access that data basically instantaneously,” Ellison said. With rivals like SAP (SAPG.DE) offering their own products that rely on memory chips, instead of slower hard drives, as much as possible for heavy number-crunching, Oracle’s new offering is seen as a must-have addition to its software lineup. “It’s another whistle and bell that Ellison and Oracle can talk up to the customer base,” said FBR analyst Daniel Ives. “It’s all about heavy-duty analytics, queries, big data. That’s what customers are focused on.”  For decades, Oracle has been seen as the gold standard for database technology, but it is under attack from smaller, aggressive companies like Salesforce.com (CRM.N) and Workday WDAY.N offering competitive software and Internet-based products at prices that often undercut Oracle.

144,ORCL,SEC charges four in California with insider trading,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday charged four San Francisco-area men with insider trading in Ross Stores Inc stock options, and one of the four with insider trading in stock options of a company that was later bought by Oracle Corp. The alleged scheme resulted in more than $12.6 million of illegal profit and was centered on Saleem Khan, a former finance manager at a healthcare nonprofit, according to the regulator. Khan will begin a 1-3/4 year prison term on June 23 after pleading guilty in an unrelated case, court records show. According to the SEC, former Ross finance executive Roshanlal Chaganlal from 2009 through 2012 routinely tipped Khan about the apparel retailer’s monthly sales results. Khan allegedly used the tips to make $11.4 million by trading Ross stock options for himself and his brother-in-law, and through intermediaries kicked $130,000 back to Chaganlal. The regulator said Khan also provided inside tips about Ross to his supervisor Ranjan Mendonsa and colleague Ammar Akbari, who made a respective $800,000 and $2,000 in Ross stock options. Khan was also accused by the SEC of making $450,000 by using tips from an Oracle insider to trade Taleo Corp stock options in the six days before Oracle agreed on Feb. 9, 2012 to buy that software company for $1.9 billion, an 18 percent premium. The SEC said Khan, Chaganlal and Akbari live in Dublin, California, where Ross is based, while Mendonsa lives in nearby San Ramon. It said they invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during the agency’s probe. Khan’s lawyer, Chris Cannon, said: “Saleem has made hundreds of short-term trades in Ross, many of which were unprofitable, and if he were trading on inside tips he would have been able to avoid the unprofitable trades.” Martin Sabelli, a lawyer for Chaganlal, declined to comment. Brian Berson, a lawyer for Akbari, said his client did not engage in insider trading. Garrick Lew, a lawyer for Mendonsa, was not immediately available for comment. Oracle spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger declined to comment. The SEC civil lawsuit seeks to recoup illegal profit and fines. It also seeks an officer-and-director bar for Chaganlal, whose employment was terminated by Ross in December 2012. The case is SEC v.

152,ORCL,"Oracle's quarterly results deepen cloud concerns, stock drops","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oracle Corp on Thursday posted fiscal fourth-quarter results that disappointed investors looking for more progress against rivals selling web-based services, sending its shares lower. Reflecting expectations of a pickup in its software business and progress in cloud computing, shares of Oracle had gained 10 percent over the past three months, double the S&P; 500’s increase. But Thursday’s results cast doubt onto Oracle’s execution in an industry facing increasingly tight competition. “It’s a bit of a jaw-dropper, in terms of Oracle missing results across the board in its historically strong fiscal year-end quarter,” said FBR analyst Dan Ives. “It’s like Spain getting knocked out of the World Cup in its first week.” Smaller, aggressive companies like Salesforce.com Inc and Workday Inc have been offering competitive software and Internet-based products at prices that often undercut Oracle. Oracle’s meager quarterly results underscore soft spending across the enterprise technology industry. Spending could become even more restrained as companies around the world move away from operating their own IT departments in favor of cloud services that cost less, said Summit Research analyst Richard Williams.       “As it moves to the cloud, overall tech spending becomes worse than a zero-sum game,” Williams said. “There’s going to be a lot of pain.”  Four-decade-old Oracle has been rolling out its own cloud-based products but they remain under 5 percent of its overall revenue.  A string of acquisitions fueling Oracle’s growth has slowed of late although the company is in talks to buy software maker Micros Systems Inc, according to a Bloomberg report this week.  “One thing that’s clear is they need to get this M&A; engine started again,” Ives said. For the fiscal first quarter, Oracle expects software and cloud revenue to grow between 6 percent and 8 percent, Chief Financial Officer Safra Catz told analysts on a conference call. That forecast includes expectations for software- and platform-related cloud services to grow between 25 percent and 35 percent.  Oracle said it expects its hardware system revenue to be in a range of down 1 percent to up 3 percent.  For its latest fourth quarter, Oracle said overall revenue rose 3 percent to $11.3 billion.

The S&P; 500 scored its third record closing high in a row while the Dow surpassed its previous record close on June 10. The blue-chip index hit an all-time intraday high at 16,978.02, coming close to the 17,000 mark. For the week, the three major U.S. stock indexes rose 1 percent as investors brushed off geopolitical concerns about Iraq and focused on the Federal Reserve’s comments indicating that it will keep interest rates low for a long period of time. The benchmark S&P; 500 has gained for six consecutive days, supporting a cautious view that a near-term correction may be inevitable. “I haven’t been concerned for weeks, but I’m becoming a bit concerned now with where the market is, especially with many indicators hitting levels that are contrary to the normal reading,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of active trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. The most notable indicators included the correlation of the CBOE Volatility Index, known as the VIX, with the S&P; 500. The VIX usually moves inversely to the S&P; 500. The fear gauge is near its lowest since February 2007 while the S&P; 500 is at an all-time high. For the VIX to be near the lowest level in more than seven years while the S&P; 500 is at a record high is causing concern that the market may be too complacent. “I’m expecting not a big correction like 10 percent or so, but a good 3 to 4 percent adjustment next week won’t be a surprise,” Frederick said. The VIX rose 2.2 percent to close at 10.85, still well below its long-term average of 20. Volume was higher than usual as Friday marked a “quadruple witching” day - the expiration of stock options, index options, index futures and single-stock futures. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 25.62 points or 0.15 percent, to end at 16,947.08. The S&P; 500 gained 3.39 points or 0.17 percent, to 1,962.87. The Nasdaq Composite  added 8.71 points or 0.20 percent, to 4,368.04. For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent, the S&P; 500 climbed 1.4 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1.3 percent. Oracle Corp shares dropped 4 percent to $40.82 and ranked among the biggest drags on the S&P; 500. The stock’s slide came a day after the software maker posted fiscal fourth-quarter results that disappointed investors looking for more progress against rivals selling web-based services. But CarMax surged 16.5 percent to $52.75. The stock was the S&P; 500’s best performer after the used-vehicle retailer reported first-quarter earnings that topped analysts’ expectations.

The stock hit a lifetime low, dropping into penny-stock territory for the first time on heavy volume. The stock fell 10.4 percent to 92 cents.

161,ORCL,"Oracle's quarterly results deepen cloud concerns, stock drops","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oracle Corp on Thursday posted fiscal fourth-quarter results that disappointed investors looking for more progress against rivals selling web-based services, sending its shares lower. Reflecting expectations of a pickup in its software business and progress in cloud computing, shares of Oracle had gained 10 percent over the past three months, double the S&P; 500’s increase. But Thursday’s results cast doubt onto Oracle’s execution in an industry facing increasingly tight competition. “It’s a bit of a jaw-dropper, in terms of Oracle missing results across the board in its historically strong fiscal year-end quarter,” said FBR analyst Dan Ives. “It’s like Spain getting knocked out of the World Cup in its first week.” Smaller, aggressive companies like Salesforce.com Inc and Workday Inc have been offering competitive software and Internet-based products at prices that often undercut Oracle. Oracle’s meager quarterly results underscore soft spending across the enterprise technology industry. Spending could become even more restrained as companies around the world move away from operating their own IT departments in favor of cloud services that cost less, said Summit Research analyst Richard Williams.       “As it moves to the cloud, overall tech spending becomes worse than a zero-sum game,” Williams said. “There’s going to be a lot of pain.”  Four-decade-old Oracle has been rolling out its own cloud-based products but they remain under 5 percent of its overall revenue.  A string of acquisitions fueling Oracle’s growth has slowed of late although the company is in talks to buy software maker Micros Systems Inc, according to a Bloomberg report this week.  “One thing that’s clear is they need to get this M&A; engine started again,” Ives said. For the fiscal first quarter, Oracle expects software and cloud revenue to grow between 6 percent and 8 percent, Chief Financial Officer Safra Catz told analysts on a conference call. That forecast includes expectations for software- and platform-related cloud services to grow between 25 percent and 35 percent.  Oracle said it expects its hardware system revenue to be in a range of down 1 percent to up 3 percent.  For its latest fourth quarter, Oracle said overall revenue rose 3 percent to $11.3 billion. That was less than the $11.48 billion analysts had expected on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.     Net income fell 4 percent to $3.6 billion. Earnings per share were unchanged at 80 cents.  On an adjusted basis, Oracle earned 92 cents per share, less than the 95 cents expected on average by analysts. Revenue from Oracle’s hardware systems products grew 2 percent to $870 million.  Shares of Oracle fell more than 5 percent in extended trade after closing down 0.70 percent at $42.51 on the New York Stock Exchange.

162,ORCL,Oracle looks to boost growth with biggest deal in five years,"(Reuters) - Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) said it would buy Micros Systems MCRS.O in a $5.3 billion deal as the world’s No.2 business software maker looks to boost flagging growth through acquisitions. The purchase of Micros, which makes point-of-sale hardware and software for restaurants and hotels, is the first multi-billion dollar acquisition by Larry Ellison-led Oracle in five years and follows disappointing fourth-quarter results. Analysts said the acquisition could be first in a string of deals for Oracle, which has been stung by aggressive pricing by companies such as Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) and Workday Inc WDAY.N for their software and internet-based products. “I think this is really Larry Ellison looking in the mirror realizing the need to get aggressive yet again on M&A;,” FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives told Reuters. “It is clear to us that the company needs to quickly put more ‘growth fuel in its engine’ to catalyze growth in the top-line,” Ives said. The Micros deal fits with Oracle’s plan to expand its fast-growing cloud business, where it has been a late entrant. Micros sells internet-connected cash registers and provides a host of cloud-based services such as e-commerce and customer relationship management to hotels and restaurant chains, including Louvre Hotels, TGI Friday’s and Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N). Micros’ full-year revenue rose 15 percent to $1.27 billion in the year ended June 2013. Oracle’s spree of acquisitions has slowed of late. Micros is the company’s largest acquisition since its $5.6 billion purchase of Sun Microsystems in 2009. “I believe it’s just the beginning of a massive M&A; cycle for Oracle where we could see them spending $15-$20 billion in acquisitions over the next one to two years,” Ives said. He reckons the deals will be focused on cloud, big data as well as cyber security. The company had $38.8 billion of cash and short-term investments as of May 31, positioning it for more deals. Oracle said on Monday it offered Micros shareholders $68 per share, representing a premium of 3.4 percent to the stock’s Friday close.  Micros shares were trading at $67.97 on Monday afternoon. Up to Friday’s close, they had risen 14 percent since Bloomberg reported on June 17 that the companies were in talks. Ives said the Micros deal could help Oracle stave off threat from e-commerce software providers such as Demandware Inc DWRE.N and NetSuite Inc N.N. Oracle said the transaction is expected to add to earnings immediately. Wedbush analyst Steve Koeing estimated the deal would add about 3-4 percent to Oracle’s revenue and add 3 cents to 4 cents per share to its earnings on a twelve-month basis.

Financial data firm Markit said its preliminary, or “flash,” U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index rose to 57.5 in June, above economist expectations for 56.5 and the highest reading since May 2010. Housing data was also encouraging. The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales in May increased 4.9 percent to an annual rate of 4.89 million units, the largest increase since August 2011. The PHLX housing sector index  gained 1.2 percent. Earlier, the HSBC/Markit Flash China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index rose into expansion territory for the first time in six months with a 50.8 reading for June, from May’s final reading of 49.4, beating the 49.7 forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. But Markit’s Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the euro zone fell to 52.8 from May’s 53.5, well below the 53.5 estimate, with France being a notable laggard and showing contraction. “Between the positive narrative provided by the Chinese expansion in manufacturing and the EU’s continued struggles with continuing the very fragile expansion intact, U.S. markets are left in what appears to be a bit of a balancing act and as a direct result we are flat,” said Peter Kenny, chief executive of Clearpool Group in New York. The S&P; 500 had risen for six straight days heading into Monday’s trading, gaining 1.7 percent over that span in its longest streak of advances since mid-April. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 22.94 points, or 0.14 percent, to 16,924.14, the S&P; 500 lost 0.41 points or 0.02 percent, to 1,962.46 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 2.07 points or 0.05 percent, to 4,365.96. France won an option to buy 20 percent of Alstom  from construction group Bouygues on Sunday in an eleventh-hour deal, clearing the way for the agreed sale of Alstom’s energy business to General Electric.

The newer systems offer more flexibility than the older ones. Spending around NoSQL technology, including on software development, license fees, and hardware, should reach $3.4 billion by 2020, according to consultancy Market Research Media Ltd, up from less than $1 billion last year. Couchbase competitors include MongoDB, which has raised $231 million from venture firms such as Union Square and Sequoia Capital, and DataStax, which has raised $84 million from backers such as Meritech Capital and Lightspeed Ventures.

171,ORCL,Arizona politician mistakes campers for migrant children: report,"(Reuters) - An Arizona congressional candidate at a protest mistook a busload of YMCA campers for undocumented immigrant children on Tuesday, according to a report on The Arizona Republic website, azcentral.com. Adam Kwasman, a Republican state representative who favors stronger border controls, had joined a group of people in the town of Oracle protesting the expected arrival of migrant children, according to a report on The Arizona Republic website, azcentral.com. The demonstrators complain that the federal government’s response to the increase in new arrivals from Central America was putting their communities at risk. Kwasman tweeted from the scene “Bus coming in. This is not compassion. This is the abrogation of the rule of law,” according to the website. Kwasman later said, “I was able to actually to see some of the children in the buses. And the fear on their faces ... This is not compassion,” according to video broadcast on the site. Told by a reporter that the children on the yellow school bus were actually YMCA campers, Kwasman said, “They were sad, too,” and admitted he made a mistake. He deleted his tweet, which can be found on Politwoops, a website that features U.S. politicians’ deleted tweets. Protesters expected the migrant children to arrive in Oracle for processing at a center near the border before being sent home, but no bus with migrants arrived on Tuesday. Kwasman was not immediately available for comment on Wednesday. He is running in the Republican primary for Congress against Arizona House Speaker Andy Tobin and businessman Gary Kiehne. The winner will face Democratic Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick in the general election.

175,ORCL,UPDATE 1-Salesforce lifts forecast on strong demand for cloud software,"(Adds forecast, analyst comment, shares, details) By Soham Chatterjee Aug 21 (Reuters) - Salesforce.com Inc reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue, helped by an increase in demand for its web-based sales and marketing software, and raised its full-year profit and revenue forecast. Businesses are increasingly moving toward cloud software services that cost less and are easier to manage, helping companies such as Salesforce and human resource management software provider Workday Inc. Spending on enterprise resource management and customer relationship management has been particularly strong. Research firm IDC expects ERM and CRM software sales to grow 20 percent at a compounded annual rate every year from 2013 to 2018. (bit.ly/1n8p3gF) Salesforce said on Thursday it expects an adjusted profit of 50-52 cents per share on revenue of $5.34-$5.37 billion for the year ending Jan. 31. It had previously forecast an adjusted profit of 49-51 cents on revenue of $5.30-$5.34 billion. Analysts were expecting a profit of 51 cents per share on revenue of $5.34 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said unbilled revenue rose by about a third to $5 billion at the end of the second quarter. “We continue to see greater upside potential in the second half as our checks suggest there are mega-deals in the pipeline that could close, aided by the maturing efforts of CRM’s new vertical-led strategy,” Susquehanna analyst J. Derrick Wood said in a pre-earnings note. Salesforce, which competes with Germany’s SAP SE  and Oracle Corp among others, is investing in software targeted at specific sectors such as healthcare to boost growth. In June, Dutch healthcare and lighting company Philips  said it was teaming up with Salesforce to offer online management of chronic diseases. Salesforce has also been buying providers of data analytics and marketing software to boost growth. The company bought data analytics firm RelateIQ Inc for about $390 million last month, its largest deal since its $2.5 billion acquisition of e-mail marketing firm ExactTarget last year. Salesforce reported net loss of $61.1 million, or 10 cents per share, for the second quarter ended July 31, compared with a profit of $76.6 million, or 12 cents per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 13 cents per share. Revenue rose to $1.32 billion from $957.1 million. Subscription and support revenue, which accounts for 93 percent of total revenue, rose 37 percent. Professional services revenue rose 58 percent. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 12 cents per share on revenue of $1.29 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Salesforce’s shares up slightly in extended trading on Thursday after closing at $55.71 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has gained 11 percent in the last three months.

177,ORCL,"Oracle loses bid to restore $1.3 billion SAP verdict, could get new trial","(Reuters) - Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) failed to revive a $1.3 billion jury verdict in its long-running copyright dispute with German software company SAP SE (SAPG.DE) as a U.S. appeals court said Oracle must choose to accept a lower amount or face a new trial. In a ruling on Friday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said jurors used “an undue amount of speculation” in awarding $1.3 billion in damages in 2010. But the court found U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton in Oakland, California, had erred in concluding that Oracle deserved only $272 million of damages, a sum Oracle rejected.  Writing for a three-judge 9th Circuit panel, Judge William Fletcher directed Hamilton to offer Oracle a choice of $356.7 million of damages or a second trial. In a statement, Oracle general counsel Dorian Daley said the company is “thrilled about this landmark recovery.” Asked whether Oracle will accept the $356.7 million or proceed to another trial, a company spokeswoman declined to comment.  SAP spokesman Andy Kendzie said the ruling is favorable and “shows the strength of our position.” The case involved SAP’s TomorrowNow unit, which the German company had bought to provide software support to Oracle customers at lower rates than what Oracle charged, hoping to persuade them to become SAP customers.  Oracle sued SAP in 2007 after noticing thousands of suspicious downloads of its software. SAP later conceded that its employees were illegally downloading Oracle files, but it couldn’t agree with Oracle on damages. The 2010 trial between the two enterprise software competitors was widely watched at the time, as top Oracle executives Larry Ellison and Safra Catz testified. Subsequently, SAP agreed to pay Oracle $306 million, but that agreement allowed Oracle to seek to restore the jury verdict, or win a retrial based on its own damages theories. During the 2010 trial, Oracle had said internal SAP documents showed the German software company expected over $1 billion in revenue from TomorrowNow. However, the 9th Circuit rejected that reasoning given that SAP had paid much less to buy TomorrowNow. “If SAP truly anticipated that TomorrowNow would produce a $1.3 billion benefit to SAP, as Oracle contends, a $10 million acquisition price is strikingly low,” Fletcher wrote. In finding the $272 million damages award “below the maximum amount sustainable by the proof,” Fletcher said Hamilton erred in finding that Oracle had lost just $36 million of profit, when the proper figure should have been $120.7 million.

179,ORCL,Oracle to face new SAP trial if it rejects new damages award,"Aug 29 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Friday said Oracle Corp must face a second trial with SAP  in a case where the European software company admitted massive copyright infringement, unless Oracle is willing to accept $356.7 million of damages. The case involved accusations that SAP’s TomorrowNow unit wrongfully downloaded millions of Oracle files. A federal jury had in 2010 awarded Oracle $1.3 billion of damages, but the trial judge said Oracle had proven actual damages of only $272 million. Oracle refused to accept that sum, leading to its appeal on damages. In Friday’s decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the trial judge incorrectly calculated the damages that Oracle had proven, and must offer it a choice between accepting $356.7 million of damages or going to trial a second time.

The Dow Jones industrial average was up 0.16 percent at 17,094.75, the S&P; 500  was unchanged at 2,002.18 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1 percent at 4,593.47. ** APPLE INC, $99.67, -3.51 pct The iPhone maker’s shares were the biggest drag on the Nasdaq index. “We recommend investors begin to take profits in Apple,”  Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves wrote in a note. Hargreaves said he will keep his “outperform” rating on the stock until Apple’s Sept. 9 event when it is expected to launch a new iPhone and wearable devices. The leak of racy celebrity photos in the past few days has put Apple in the unusual position of having to mend its image days before the highly anticipated launch. ** MOBILEYE NV, $48.35, +12.36 pct Morgan Stanley analysts said if the maker of collision-avoidance systems for cars held its current pricing, 80 percent market share, and gross margins of around 75 percent, the stock could rise towards $100. “We believe, if no real competitive or pricing threat manifests itself in the next 12-18 months, Mobileye stock will be on track toward our bull case,” the analysts said. The company’s products are used in 237 car models from carmakers, including BMW AG, General Motors Co and Tesla Motors Inc.

The company’s shares fell as much as 40 percent to record low of $3.38 and was the top percentage loser on the Nasdaq on Wednesday at 12.16 p.m. ET. Robert W. Baird & Co cuts price target on stock to $7 from $12. ** VINCE HOLDING CORP, $34.09, -12.00 pct The luxury apparel maker’s shares fell the most since debuting last November after second-quarter same-store sales growth slowed to 7.1 pct from 11.1 pct and 12.2 pct in past two quarters. Slowing same-store sales growth was a cause for concern, said Stifel Nicolaus analysts. The stock had almost doubled in value from its $20 offer price, through Tuesday’s close. ** COUPONS.COM INC, $14.64, -10.07 pct The digital coupon company’s shares were the second-biggest percentage loser on the New York Stock Exchange after their lockup period, which prohibits insiders or those holding large stakes from selling, expired. ** IMAGE SENSING SYSTEMS INC, $8.95, +34.18 pct The surveillance camera maker’s shares continued their rally that started since a policeman fatally shot an unarmed teenager in Ferguson, Missouri on Aug. 9 from when it had tripled up to Tuesday’s close. ** YANDEX NV, $30.55, +5.13 pct ** CTC MEDIA INC, $9.7, +9.42 pct ** MOBILE TELESYSTEMS OAO, $19.05, +4.27 pct ** VIMPELCOM LTD, $8.77, +2.45 pct Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko said he and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on a “permanent ceasefire” in eastern Ukraine. ** LUMBER LIQUIDATORS HOLDINGS, $58.62, +5.95 pct The hardwood flooring retailers stock was upgraded to “outperform” from “neutral” by Wedbush Securities. The company is poised for higher sales and gross margin in 2015 and worst of supply chain issues and industry and competitive pressures are behind company, Wedbush analyst Seth Basham wrote in note. Of 16 analysts covering stock, 3 have “strong buy” ratings, 4 have “buy” and 9 have “hold”. ** J.C. PENNEY CO INC, $10.695, +1.47 pct CNBC’s “Mad Money” host, Jim Cramer, said on Tuesday that the department store chain’s stock was heading to $15 and he remained a strong buyer of Penney shares.

The FDA letter labels periodic updates of company’s pump software as “significant” modifications to previously cleared pump systems that could affect safety or effectiveness of devices. The FDA said products are, therefore, “adulterated” and “misbranded”. The stock, which debuted in July, was largest percentage loser on the Nasdaq on Wednesday. ** G-III APPAREL GROUP, $88.15, +4.72 pct The apparel and accessories maker’s second quarter sales of $424.0 million beat average analyst estimate of $391.3 million, helped by better demand for Calvin Klein brand.

Part of net proceeds from sale of notes would be used to fund drug development, the company said. ** DELTA AIR LINES INC, $38.67, -5.52 pct The airline operator cut its third quarter passenger unit revenue growth forecast to up to 3 percent from up to 4 percent.

192,ORCL,"DataStax raises $106 million to take on Oracle, Microsoft","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - DataStax, which helps companies deal with the vast troves of data scattered around the Internet, said it had raised $106 million, further enabling it take on incumbents such as Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).  DataStax uses a technology known as Apache Cassandra, one of a new breed of so-called NoSQL databases that offer more flexibility than traditional databases. Traditional incumbents include Oracle’s MySQL, Microsoft’s SQL Server and IBM’s DB2. “Cassandra, from the day it was created, was built to withstand unbelievable amounts of failure in the underlying system and still be available,” said Billy Bosworth, DataStax’s chief executive officer. In the event of floods or earthquakes, for example, data is still available due to replication at other data centers. Spending around NoSQL technology, including on software development, license fees, and hardware, should reach $3.4 billion by 2020, according to consultancy Market Research Media Ltd, up from less than $1 billion last year. DataStax competitors include MongoDB, which has raised $231 million from venture firms such as Union Square and Sequoia Capital, and Couchbase, which has raised $100 million from firms such as Accel, Ignition Partners and Mayfield. The latest round, led by new investor Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, brings DataStax’s total funding to $190 million. Additional new investors include ClearBridge, Cross Creek, Wasatch, PremjiInvest and Comcast Ventures.

194,ORCL,"Oracle's Ellison steps aside, co-CEOs Catz and Hurd take over","SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Larry Ellison, co-founder and leader of Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) for almost four decades, stepped aside as chief executive on Thursday, to be replaced by co-CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd, but stressed that nothing at the business software company will change.  The move comes earlier than expected by many investors, and appears designed to address concerns about the company’s direction under Ellison, 70, who has been the Oracle’s only CEO in its 37-year history. “While there was some speculation Larry could step down, the timing is a bit of a head scratcher and the Street will have many questions,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. “Investors have a mixed view of Safra and especially Hurd as co-CEOs given the missteps we have seen from the company over the past few years.” Oracle shares fell 2 percent to $40.70 in after-hours trading after it reported the management shake-up and profit below Wall Street’s average forecast, hurt by weak hardware sales.  “I’m going to continue doing what I’ve been doing over the last several years. They’re going to continue what they’ve been doing over the last several years,” Ellison said on a conference call with analysts, referring to Hurd, 57, and Catz, 52. “Mark and Safra have done a spectacular job and I think they deserve the recognition of their new titles.”  Catz, responding to an analyst who asked what the management shuffle would mean further down the company, said nothing will change.  “I want to make sure we are very, very clear. There will actually be no changes,” said Catz. “No changes whatsoever.”  The creation of two CEO roles, which has largely been unsuccessful when tried at other companies, raises questions of how Catz and Hurd will work together at the top.  “Co-CEO structures are typically not ideal,” said Bill Kreher, an analyst at Edward Jones. “They’re both very independent thinkers who have strong wills. At times they won’t agree. But they have worked closely together, and with Ellison. We don’t see the day-to-day changing.” Hurd stressed that Oracle was not hierarchical and also stressed a lack of change. “We’re pretty flat in terms of the way we run the place, and we want to keep it that way,” he told the conference call. Under the new arrangement, Ellison, who co-founded the database company that became Oracle in 1977, will become executive chairman and chief technology officer. Manufacturing, finance and legal functions at Oracle will continue to report to Catz, while sales and service units will continue to report to Hurd. Software and hardware engineering will continue to report to Ellison. The major difference is that Catz and Hurd will now report to Oracle’s board, rather than to Ellison himself, although Ellison is now executive chairman of that board.  Ellison will keep working full time, Oracle said in a statement. His step back from the top job mirrors his friend Bill Gates at Microsoft, who stepped down as chairman of the software giant earlier this year but remains a board member and adviser to new CEO Satya Nadella.  Raised in a rough Chicago neighborhood, Ellison built Oracle into one of Silicon Valley’s most successful technology companies, whose databases have become the technology backbones of the world’s largest corporations. Ellison took the company public in 1986, the same year as Microsoft, with revenue of $55 million. This fiscal year revenues are expected to top $40 billion. Through dozens of acquisitions, Ellison widened Oracle’s portfolio of business software to include tools for customer service, human resources and business intelligence, investing tens of billions of dollars to acquire PeopleSoft, Siebel Systems and other tech companies. But in recent years, Ellison stumbled. Investors widely criticized his $7.4 billion acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2010 after sales of Sun servers and other equipment fell after the deal. Ellison famously mocked cloud computing as “complete gibberish” in a 2008 tirade after a Wall Street analyst asked him to comment on the new phenomenon, a broad term referring to the delivery of computer services via the Internet from remote data centers.  Since his remarks, cloud computing has become a driving force in enterprise software and Oracle is struggling to build out its own cloud offerings to catch up with smaller rivals. Ellison, who battled big rivals IBM (IBM.N) and SAP (SAPG.DE) for most of his tenure, appeared to change his tune this year, when he called Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Salesforce.com (CRM.N) the company’s most immediate threat.

We don’t see the day-to-day changing.” Hurd stressed that Oracle was not hierarchical and also stressed a lack of change. “We’re pretty flat in terms of the way we run the place, and we want to keep it that way,” he told the conference call. Under the new arrangement, Ellison, who co-founded the database company that became Oracle in 1977, will become executive chairman and chief technology officer. Manufacturing, finance and legal functions at Oracle will continue to report to Catz, while sales and service units will continue to report to Hurd. Software and hardware engineering will continue to report to Ellison. The major difference is that Catz and Hurd will now report to Oracle’s board, rather than to Ellison himself, although Ellison is now executive chairman of that board. Ellison will keep working full time, Oracle said in a statement. His step back from the top job mirrors his friend Bill Gates at Microsoft, who stepped down as chairman of the software giant earlier this year but remains a board member and adviser to new CEO Satya Nadella. Raised in a rough Chicago neighborhood, Ellison built Oracle into one of Silicon Valley’s most successful technology companies, whose databases have become the technology backbones of the world’s largest corporations. Ellison took the company public in 1986, the same year as Microsoft, with revenue of $55 million. This fiscal year revenues are expected to top $40 billion. Through dozens of acquisitions, Ellison widened Oracle’s portfolio of business software to include tools for customer service, human resources and business intelligence, investing tens of billions of dollars to acquire PeopleSoft, Siebel Systems and other tech companies. But in recent years, Ellison stumbled. Investors widely criticized his $7.4 billion acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2010 after sales of Sun servers and other equipment fell after the deal. Ellison famously mocked cloud computing as “complete gibberish” in a 2008 tirade after a Wall Street analyst asked him to comment on the new phenomenon, a broad term referring to the delivery of computer services via the Internet from remote data centers. Since his remarks, cloud computing has become a driving force in enterprise software and Oracle is struggling to build out its own cloud offerings to catch up with smaller rivals. Ellison, who battled big rivals IBM and SAP  for most of his tenure, appeared to change his tune this year, when he called Amazon.com and Salesforce.com  the company’s most immediate threat.

197,ORCL,"US STOCKS-Dow, S&P; 500 at records as Fed-driven rally continues","* Financials lead gains; Goldman gains 1.7 pct * Oracle shares down after hours * Indexes up: Dow 0.64 pct; S&P; 0.49 pct; Nasdaq 0.68 pct By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Sept 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Thursday, a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve kept intact its pledge to keep interest rates low, providing a backstop for investors that helped lift both the Dow and S&P; to record highs. The Fed said Wednesday at the conclusion of a two-day policy meeting it would keep interest rates near zero for a “considerable time,” language supportive of equities which some had expected to be dropped from the statement. The central bank’s outlook on Wednesday included forecasts for higher-than-expected rates in 2015 and 2016, which helped financial stocks rise 1.1 percent, leading the day’s gains on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs rose 1.7 percent to $187.89, the biggest boost to the Dow. U.S. equity markets have rallied for three consecutive sessions as the Fed’s stance eased investor worries the central bank was ready to pivot away from its years-long policy of holding rates at rock bottom levels, which stimulated demand for risk assets like stocks. That support has lifted the benchmark S&P; 500 to 34 records in 2014, and has helped markets sidestep a 10-percent “correction” for almost three years, even while individual market sectors have seen multiple pullbacks. The climb to repeated record highs has coincided with steadily improving economic data, while the Fed’s support has allowed investors to shrug off occasional weak numbers, like the August payrolls report. At the same time, low Treasury interest rates have pushed yield-hungry investors into equities. U.S. housing starts and permits fell in August, but upward revisions to the prior month’s data indicated gradual improvement in the housing market. A sharp drop in the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week suggested the slowdown in job growth last month was probably an anomaly. “Things are starting to get a little better for the banks in general and that really does help the financials,” said Patty Edwards, managing director for investments at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. “You are seeing low growth starting to improve some, you are starting to see all the things that would turn in an economy.” The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 109.14 points, or 0.64 percent, to 17,265.99, the S&P; 500 added  9.79 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,011.36, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 31.24 points, or 0.68 percent, to 4,593.43. After the closing bell, Oracle Corp shares fell 2.2 percent to $40.64. The business software maker reported quarterly results and said long-time chief executive Larry Ellison will become executive chairman and chief technology officer, with executives Safra Catz and Mark Hurd taking over the CEO role. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,845 to 1,200, for a 1.54-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,622 issues rose and 1,083 fell for a 1.50-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.

201,ORCL,"When music stops for Oracle CEO dance, Catz may grab Ellison's chair : analysts","NEW YORK (Reuters) - If Larry Ellison sailed off on his yacht for good tomorrow, who would really run Oracle Corp (ORCL.N)? Reuters asked a cast of Wall Streets analysts, and the verdict is dealmaker and finance guru Safra Catz.  The question is on investors’ minds after Ellison, 70, promoted both Catz and sales leader Mark Hurd to the CEO position on Thursday, while taking on the role of executive chairman and chief technology officer himself.  The move appears to be the first stage of Ellison’s gradual withdrawal. But what if Ellison disappeared immediately? Of 12 analysts who replied to an anonymous poll, five said Catz would likely run Oracle, while only one voted for Hurd, 57. Four said both would continue to run the company, one said neither, and one plumped for dark-horse internal candidate  Thomas Kurian.   Oracle did not respond to a request for comment. Votes in favor of Catz, the 52-year old former Wall Street banker who orchestrated Oracle’s multibillion dollar acquisitions and has been Ellison’s de facto deputy for the last few years, stressed her 15 years of experience at the company. Hurd, who only joined Oracle in 2010 after leaving Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) under the cloud of a business ethics breach, has a larger public presence but is still seen as a newcomer. “In a CEO cage match it’s pretty even, but I give Safra extra credit for her years of service with the company,” said Kim Forrest at Fort Pitt Capital. “She likely knows the lay of the land better.” Only one analyst said Hurd was the more likely to lead the company, chiefly because he is the one with experience of being the CEO of a large technology company.  One analyst said neither would likely be CEO, echoing sentiments that Ellison does not fully back either candidate to solely run the company he co-founded 37 years ago and built into a $40 billion-a-year giant.  “It’s pretty clear that part of the board doesn’t fully trust Mark Hurd and part of the board doesn’t think she (Catz) has the technology depth,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, professor at the Yale School of Management, who was not part of the poll.  Most analysts think the co-CEO arrangement should work in the short term, but questions remain over how long it will last.   “I don’t know the timing - it could be three, it could be five years - there may be one (CEO) down the road,” said  Gartner analyst Chad Eschinger. He would not be drawn on who that might be.  One figure not mentioned in Thursday’s reshuffle was 47-year-old Kurian, Oracle’s executive vice president in charge of product development, who reports directly to Ellison and has been seen as a rising power in the company.  “Perhaps he did not feel comfortable in the role as a front man, although he does do a solid job in his presentations,” said Bill Kreher, an analyst at Edward Jones. “He’s a few years younger (than Catz and Hurd), so perhaps his time will come.” ",9192014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oracle-ceo-analysts/when-music-stops-for-oracle-ceo-dance-catz-may-grab-ellisons-chair-analysts-idUSKBN0HE2IO20140919
202,ORCL,US STOCKS-Wall St flat as Oracle takes air out of Alibaba debut,"* Alibaba soars in debut, Yahoo falls * Oracle drags after Ellison steps aside as CEO * Quadruple witching lifts volume * Indexes: Dow up 0.08 pct, S&P; off 0.04 pct, Nasdaq off 0.3 pct By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Sept 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed little changed on Friday after Alibaba’s strong debut was offset by falling technology shares as Oracle and Yahoo stumbled, but the Dow managed to edge higher to set a record for a second straight session. Alibaba took the spotlight after its initial public offering priced at $68 a share and rose as high as $99.70 before ending the session up 38 percent to $93.89. Shares of Yahoo , which is selling part of its Alibaba stake but will remain a top shareholder, were volatile in heavy volume and closed down 2.7 percent at $40.93. “Alibaba was awesome. The Alibaba deal was done correctly, which is, you leave something on the table for investors to enjoy,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York. “So the market got to focus on Alibaba, which was a positive.” But technology shares weighed on the S&P; 500 with Oracle  down after Larry Ellison, co-founder and leader for 37 years, stepped aside as chief executive. He will be replaced by co-CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd, raising questions about a job-sharing arrangement that has had a mixed record elsewhere. Oracle shares lost 4.2 percent to $39.80 as the biggest drag on the S&P; 500 while the S&P; technology index was the worst performing of the 10 major S&P; sectors. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 13.75 points, or 0.08 percent, to 17,279.74, the S&P; 500 lost 0.96 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,010.40, and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 13.64 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,579.79. Volume was heavy, with about 8.68 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, well above the 5.71 billion average so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets. Aside from Alibaba, volume also received a boost from “quadruple witching,” the expiration of futures and options for indexes and stocks. Dresser-Rand jumped 9.4 percent to $79.91 after a report Germany’s Siemens plans to offer more than $6.1 billion, or $80 per share, for the U.S. compressor and turbine maker.

203,ORCL,"With co-CEOs, Oracle sets challenging course","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - By promoting its two presidents to serve as co-chief executives instead of founder and CEO Larry Ellison, database-and-software behemoth Oracle (ORCL.N) is setting itself a course that has confounded other big companies. The move seemingly marries the product oversight of Mark Hurd, former chief executive of Hewlett Packard, with the legal and financial expertise of Safra Catz, a 15-year Oracle veteran. With Ellison remaining executive chairman and in a position to call the final shots, the company may be able to avoid some of the challenges that have mired other co-CEOs, who often end up in an unhappy “two’s-a-crowd” situation, analysts say.  At Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, for example, Wenda Harris Millard was supposed to oversee media, while co-CEO Robin Marino held responsibility for marketing. That lasted just 10 months, with Millard quitting in early 2009 after frequent clashes with Marino and company founder Stewart.   At Citigroup, a co-CEO arrangement between John Reed and Sandy Weill, two strong personalities who publicly jousted, fell apart when Reed left in 2000.   “Co-CEO structures are typically not ideal,” said Bill Kreher, an analyst at Edward Jones, who says most companies need the decisiveness that a single strong-willed leader offers. But at Oracle, because the duo has already worked together for years, “we don’t see the day-to-day changing,” Kreher said.  Catz, trained in finance and law, was a Wall Street banker from 1986 until she joined Oracle in 1999 and has been a central figure in Oracle’s many acquisitions. Sales-oriented Hurd spent 25 years at computer and ATM pioneer NCR Corp before joining Hewlett-Packard, where he was CEO from 2005 until 2010.  Still, many analysts believe a single CEO will eventually replace Ellison, be it Catz, Hurd, or perhaps another executive such as Oracle software head Thomas Kurian.  Reverting to a single CEO would bring Oracle in line with other software companies that have tried the dual track but subsequently abandoned it.  Enterprise-software company Workday said in May that co-founder and co-CEO David Duffield would step down as co-CEO, leaving the role to Aneel Bhusri. Also in May, German software giant SAP, a key competitor of Oracle, ended a co-CEO arrangement when Jim Hagemann Snabe stepped down. “It has to be executed right, and you have to have the right working relationship to make it work,” Derrick Wood, an analyst at Susquehanna, said of the dual-CEO track.  Cases where it succeeds often include a founder who acts as the visionary alongside a co-CEO who serves as the operations head, such as at retailer Whole Foods Market and fast-food restaurant Chipotle Mexican Grill. That almost fits the situation at Oracle, except operations will be run by two people. Having three, including Ellison, at the top makes Oracle analogous to Korea’s Samsung Electronics. Last year, Samsung gave consumer-electronics head Yoon Boo-Keun and mobile chief J.K. Shiin co-CEO titles, joining existing CEO Kwon Oh-hyun. The co-CEO arrangement is more common in Europe, notes Harvard Business School professor emeritus Joseph Bower. Deutsche Bank and its co-CEOs Anshu Jain and Juergen Fitschen are a prominent example. “The downside in terms of confusion is obvious,” said Bower.

210,ORCL,"UPDATE 6-Oracle's Ellison steps aside, co-CEOs Catz and Hurd take over","(Adds background on Catz and Hurd) By Noel Randewich and Bill Rigby SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Larry Ellison, co-founder and leader of Oracle Corp for 37 years, stepped aside as chief executive officer on Thursday, to be replaced by co-CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd, raising questions about a job-sharing arrangement that has had a fraught record elsewhere. Ellison and the two new co-CEOs each stressed that nothing would change under the new management structure, with Ellison staying on as executive chairman and chief technology officer. But Oracle shares fell 2 percent to $40.70 in after-hours trading after it reported the management shake-up and that profit had fallen below Wall Street’s average forecast, hurt by weak hardware sales. The move immediately attracted criticism from management  experts. “In almost all cases, these co-CEO configurations are a jerry-rigged solution to a political problem,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at Yale School of Management. The move comes earlier than expected by many investors, and appears designed to address concerns about the company’s direction under Ellison, 70, who co-founded the database company that became Oracle in 1977 and has been Oracle’s only CEO. “While there was some speculation Larry could step down, the timing is a bit of a head scratcher and the Street will have many questions,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. “Investors have a mixed view of Safra and especially Hurd as co-CEOs given the missteps we have seen from the company over the past few years.” On a conference call with analysts, Ellison said: “I’m going to continue doing what I’ve been doing over the last several years. They’re going to continue what they’ve been doing over the last several years,” referring to Hurd, 57, and Catz, 52. “Mark and Safra have done a spectacular job and I think they deserve the recognition of their new titles.” Catz and Hurd echoed that mantra on the call. “I want to make sure we are very, very clear. There will actually be no changes,” said Catz. “No changes whatsoever.” For his part, Hurd stressed that Oracle was not hierarchical. “We’re pretty flat in terms of the way we run the place, and we want to keep it that way,” he told the conference call. The creation of two CEO roles, which has largely been unsuccessful when tried at other companies, raises questions of how Catz and Hurd, both strong personalities, will work together at the top. “Co-CEO structures are typically not ideal,” said Bill Kreher, an analyst at Edward Jones. “They’re both very independent thinkers who have strong wills. At times they won’t agree. But they have worked closely together, and with Ellison. We don’t see the day-to-day changing.” The two have very different histories. Catz, trained in finance and law, was a Wall Street banker from 1986 until she joined Oracle in 1999, and has been a central figure in Oracle’s many acquisitions. Sales-oriented Hurd spent 25 years at computer and ATM pioneer NCR Corp before joining Hewlett-Packard, where he was CEO from 2005 until 2010, when he resigned in the wake of sexual harassment claims by a female contractor. HP concluded that its harassment policy had not been violated but that Hurd had made inaccurate expense claims concealing entertainment for the contractor. He was courted by Ellison and joined Oracle later that year. Under the new arrangement, manufacturing, finance and legal functions at Oracle will continue to report to Catz, while sales and service units will continue to report to Hurd. Software and hardware engineering will continue to report to Ellison. The major difference is that Catz and Hurd will now report to Oracle’s board, rather than to Ellison himself, although Ellison is now executive chairman of that board. Ellison will keep working full time, Oracle said in a statement. His step back from the top job mirrors Bill Gates at Microsoft, who stepped down as chairman of the software giant earlier this year but remains a board member and adviser to new CEO Satya Nadella. Ellison has recently been edging back from his role as the face of Oracle. Last year, he skipped a quarterly conference call to be out on the water to watch his Oracle Team USA compete in sailing’s America’s Cup, and he also skipped his widely followed keynote speech at Oracle’s OpenWorld conference as the regatta got down to its nail-biting final races. But he promised to appear on the company’s quarterly earnings calls with analysts. “You’ll have to wait a little while longer before you get me off the calls,” he told analysts on Thursday. “I apologize to everyone for that.” Marc Benioff, CEO of Oracle competitor Salesforce.com, commented on Twitter that Ellison will remain in power. “There always has been, & always will be, one CEO at Oracle,” Benioff tweeted in reaction to the news. Raised in a rough Chicago neighborhood, Ellison built Oracle into one of Silicon Valley’s most successful technology companies, whose databases have become the technology backbones of the world’s largest corporations. Ellison took the company public in 1986, the same year as Microsoft, with revenue of $55 million. This fiscal year revenues are expected to top $40 billion. Through dozens of acquisitions, Ellison widened Oracle’s portfolio of business software to include tools for customer service, human resources and business intelligence, investing tens of billions of dollars to acquire PeopleSoft, Siebel Systems and other tech companies. But in recent years, Ellison has stumbled. Investors widely criticized his $7.4 billion acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2010 after sales of Sun servers and other equipment fell after the deal. Ellison famously mocked cloud computing as “complete gibberish” in a 2008 tirade after a Wall Street analyst asked him to comment on the new phenomenon, a broad term referring to the delivery of computer services via the Internet from remote data centers. Since his remarks, cloud computing has become a driving force in enterprise software and Oracle is struggling to build out its own cloud offerings to catch up with smaller rivals. Ellison, who battled big rivals IBM and SAP  for most of his tenure, appeared to change his tune this year, when he called Amazon.com and Salesforce.com  the company’s most immediate threat.

212,ORCL,Oracle's Ellison took smaller pay package in fiscal 2014,"(Reuters) - Oracle Corp’s (ORCL.N) Larry Ellison, who is stepping aside as chief executive officer, took less money home in fiscal 2014 that the year before following criticism of his compensation and concerns about the software company’s struggles against smaller rivals. Ellison received $67.3 million as compensation in 2014, a 15.5 percent drop from a year earlier, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Oracle surprised Wall Street last week with the announcement that Ellison, who the cofounded the company four decades ago and owns a quarter of it, would be replaced by Presidents Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.  Compensation for Catz and Hurd stood at $37.7 million each for the fiscal year ended May 2014, also less than in the previous year, according to the filing. For fiscal 2015, Oracle is reducing the number of stock options granted to the three senior executives and introducing performance stock units, which will be awarded based on Oracle’s success against rivals including SAP and IBM (IBM.N).  Ellison, whose 2013 compensation was $79.6 million, will take over as executive chairman and chief technology officer. In recent years, some investors have opposed Ellison’s pay packages, complaining that the world’s fifth-richest man makes too much money as his company struggles. While Ellison, Catz and Hurd took home less total pay last year, their stock options and other incentives are still generous, said Michael Pryce-Jones, an analyst at CtW Investment Group, which advises union pension funds and has been a critic of Ellison’s compensation.   “Careful scrutiny and caution are warranted because we’re still looking at awards with huge economic value. You’ve got Catz and Hurd on a huge number and Ellison hasn’t taken a huge dip either,” Pryce-Jones said. Oracle’s compensation committee reduced Ellison’s stock option awards for 2015 to 2.25 million shares from 7 million shares in fiscal 2014, the filing showed.  Catz and Hurd were granted a special one-time stock option award for 500,000 shares each, taking the options for 2015 to 2.75 million shares each, down from 5 million the year before.  Last year, a  majority of shareholders opposed Ellison’s pay in a non-binding vote. While the voting result requires no changes from the company, it underscored concern among shareholders about high pay as the company struggles to fend off smaller, aggressive companies offering software and Internet-based products at prices that often undercut Oracle.  “The issues remain the same. Oracle has misexecuted and shown disappointing numbers to the street for the better part of the last few years,” said FBR analyst Daniel Ives. In fiscal 2014 Ellison collected a salary of $1, with the rest of his compensation coming mostly from stock options.

216,ORCL,UPDATE 1-Cisco CEO Chambers rules out EMC takeover deal,"(Adds source-based information about state of EMC deal talks, additional comment from Chambers, share movement) By Christian Plumb and Liana B. Baker NEW YORK, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Cisco Chief Executive Officer John Chambers on Wednesday said the networking company was not among the potential suitors for data storage products maker EMC Corp, which the Wall Street Journal has said is exploring options that include a sale. Chambers, speaking at a Wall Street Journal breakfast, said he usually avoided commenting on potential deals but would make an exception in this case. Cisco typically gets “the opportunity for almost every move in the industry” in terms of potential deals, he added. “If Joe and I were going to do something here we would have done it a year or two ago,” he said, referring to EMC CEO Joe Tucci, who is expected to retire in February. EMC has held merger talks with Hewlett-Packard Co  that have since ended and are unlikely to resume, according to people familiar with the matter. No talks are under way between EMC and any other big technology companies with the firepower to make a sizeable acquisition, including Oracle Corp, Dell Inc  and Cisco, the people said. People with knowledge of the approaches say Elliott Management, an activist investor in EMC, has spoken to various technology companies, including Dell, Cisco and Oracle, to discuss various options, including a sale. The people said those companies were not interested in those options at this time. EMC, which has a market capitalization of nearly $61 billion, has rebuffed pressure from Elliott to spin off software maker VMware Inc, a person familiar with the situation told Reuters earlier this month. Shares of EMC were down 0.6 percent at $29.66 in late-morning trading, while Cisco rose 0.7 percent to $24.88.

220,ORCL,Larry Ellison still the top draw at Oracle's mega-convention,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Larry Ellison was the main draw for tens of thousands of technology professionals at Oracle Corp’s annual conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, where he joked about losing his name after relinquishing his role as the company’s CEO. Ellison, who this month gave up his position as chief executive of the enterprise software behemoth he co-founded 37 years ago, stuck to his tradition of delivering the main presentation at Oracle OpenWorld. Oracle surprised Wall Street on Sept. 18 with the announcement that Ellison, who owns a quarter of the company, would be replaced by presidents Safra Catz and Mark Hurd. Oracle has stressed that nothing would change under the new management structure, with the 70-year-old Ellison staying on as executive chairman and chief technology officer. Speaking to a standing-room-only crowd in a football-field-sized room, Ellison mostly pitched Oracle’s newest offerings in software and other IT delivered over the Internet - a growing trend known as cloud computing. But he won laughter with a handful of off-script comments about his new role at the company, including one during a demonstration of a new service that lets customers easily move applications from their own data centers to Oracle’s cloud. “I’m CTO now, I have to do my demos by myself. I used to have help, now it’s gone,” Ellison joked. “I love my new job by the way.” Minutes later, as he filled in a webpage as part of the same demonstration, he joked, “They took away my CEO title, they took away my name. It’s been a rough few weeks.” Close to 60,000 people were enrolled for this year’s OpenWorld, which includes technical courses, cocktail parties and a concert by Aerosmith. The event is a major opportunity for Ellison to pitch Oracle’s latest products and vision to  corporate customers, engineers and IT managers. “He makes a big impact, the way he showcases his technology. His selling power is great,” said OpenWorld attendee Vijay Thakkar. “A lot of people come just to see him.” Ellison has previously edged back from Oracle’s helm. He apologized to Tuesday’s audience for skipping his keynote speech at last year’s OpenWorld to be on the water with his Oracle Team USA sailing team during the final neck-and-neck races of the America’s Cup regatta. Smaller, aggressive companies like Salesforce.com  and Workday have been offering competitive software and Internet-based products at prices that often undercut Oracle, whose strategy has been to integrate software with its own high-end, expensive hardware for greater efficiency. In response, Oracle has been acquiring cloud-related companies and rolling out its own cloud-based products. But while those products are growing quickly, they remain a small fraction of the company’s total business. It was the second presentation in three days that Ellison devoted to talking up the progress Oracle has made in cloud computing, which accounts for just 5 percent of his company’s revenue.

225,ORCL,"Oracle, SAP settle long-running TomorrowNow lawsuit","(Reuters) - Oracle Corp and SAP SE have settled long-running copyright litigation for $356.7 million over improper downloads of Oracle files, ending a fierce legal battle between the two enterprise software rivals.     The case involved SAP’s TomorrowNow unit, which the German company bought to provide software support to Oracle customers at lower rates than what Oracle charged, hoping to persuade them to become SAP customers. Oracle sued SAP in 2007 after noticing thousands of suspicious downloads of its software. A California jury awarded Oracle $1.3 billion in 2010, but that amount was knocked down in subsequent judicial rulings. Earlier this year a federal appeals court said Oracle could either accept $356.7 million, or opt for a retrial against SAP. “We are thrilled about this landmark recovery and extremely gratified that our efforts to protect innovation and our shareholders’ interests are duly rewarded,” Oracle’s general counsel Dorian Daley said in a statement. SAP said it was pleased that the courts “ultimately accepted SAP’s arguments to limit Oracle’s excessive damages claims and that Oracle has finally chosen to end this matter.” After Oracle sued, SAP conceded that its employees were illegally downloading Oracle files, but it could not agree with Oracle on damages. The 2010 trial between the two companies was widely watched, as top Oracle executives Larry Ellison and Safra Catz testified. The downloads also resulted in a criminal probe, which SAP agreed to pay $20 million to resolve.  The civil case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California was Oracle USA, Inc., et al. v. SAP AG, et al, 07-cv-1658.

227,ORCL,"US STOCKS-Wall St rallies after Fed, energy gains; S&P; 500 posts best day since 2013","* Fed on track to raise rates sometime next year * Energy shares lead gains on S&P; 500 * Indexes up: Dow 1.7 pct, S&P; 2 pct, Nasdaq 2.1 pct   (Updates close with Oracle up after the bell) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The S&P; 500 scored its best day since October 2013 on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve gave an upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy and said it would take a patient approach toward raising interest rates. The rally, which followed a three-day losing streak, was also driven by a 4.2 percent gain in the S&P; energy index . Following a two-day meeting, the U.S. central bank gave a strong signal that it was on track to raise interest rates sometime next year. The Fed said it would take a “patient” approach in deciding when to bump borrowing costs higher, which Fed Chair Janet Yellen, at a news conference, defined as “at least a couple of meetings.” The statement from the Fed, which has kept benchmark rates near zero since 2008, came against a backdrop of solid domestic economic growth but trouble overseas. “This is the market saying, ‘Ah, I get it,’ the Fed does not want to be in the business of disruption, this is a steady monetary policy and the Fed will continue to be supportive of asset prices,” said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman Private Banking in New York. In other comments, Yellen said it was not a major concern that some banks may be leveraged and exposed to oil price moves. U.S. and Brent oil are down roughly 50 percent since June. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 288 points, or 1.69 percent, to 17,356.87, while the S&P; 500 gained 40.15 points, or 2.04 percent - its biggest daily percentage rise since October 2013 - to 2,012.89. The Nasdaq Composite  added 96.48 points, or 2.12 percent, to 4,644.31. All 10 S&P; sectors ended higher, with all but the industrials sector up at least 1 percent. Shares of Exxon Mobil jumped 3 percent to $89.02, while Chevron gained 4.2 percent to $106.02. Energy shares have fallen sharply with the recent heavy selloff in oil prices. Shares of the Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, a closed-end mutual fund listed on Nasdaq, hit a seven-year high as President Barack Obama announced a move to normalize relations between the United States and Cuba. The fund, which holds stocks and assets that fund manager Thomas Herzfeld believes would benefit from an eventual end to the U.S. economic embargo against Cuba, rose 28.9 percent. After the bell, shares of Oracle jumped 4.7 percent to $43.11 as the company posted a 3.5 percent rise in total revenue in the company’s first quarter since Larry Ellison stepped down as chief executive. About 9.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 7.3 billion average this month, according to BATS Global Markets.

230,ORCL,U.S. top court bars Arizona from denying driver's licenses to immigrants,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday blocked the state of Arizona from enforcing a policy that denies driver’s licenses to young immigrants granted legal status by President Barack Obama in 2012. The court denied the request by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer to place a hold on a ruling from the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which said the policy had no legal basis. The state must now let roughly 20,000 eligible immigrants apply for driver’s licenses. “This is the best day ever,” said Phoenix-based activist Dulce Matuz. “This will mean a lot to so many people.” Matuz, whose Arizona Dream Act Coalition was among the groups that challenged the policy in court, said the decision saves taxpayer dollars and would have an immediate impact.  “This is going to open the door for people to begin living a more normal life,” she said. It was not clear when the licenses will be available. The Supreme Court’s brief order noted that three conservative members among the nine justices - Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito - would have granted Arizona’s request. The affected residents were granted legal status under a 2012 federal program that critics called amnesty. A similar program announced by President Barack Obama last month would grant legal status to 4.4 million immigrants. Brewer, a Republican who is about to leave office, and fellow Republican governors have said they will contest that program in court. Brewer’s spokesman, Andrew Wilder, said the state was waiting for a lower court to issue the injunction needed to bring the Supreme Court ruling into force.  To be eligible under the 2012 program called “Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,” or DACA, immigrants must have come to the United States before the age of 16 and had to be below 31 as of June 15, 2012. They must also be enrolled in school, or have graduated from high school or obtained a high school equivalency diploma, and have no serious criminal convictions. Carla Chavarria, who came to Arizona illegally with her mother from Mexico City in 2000, said the days of her being considered a second-class citizen were over. “I’ve done everything I could to belong to this country,” said Chavarria, 21, who started a marketing company in the Phoenix area and was also a plaintiff in the lawsuit. “It wasn’t fair that I wasn’t able to drive. Now that’s all changed.” ",12172014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-immigration/u-s-top-court-bars-arizona-from-denying-drivers-licenses-to-immigrants-idUSKBN0JV27320141217

232,ORCL,US STOCKS-Wall St has best 2-day gain since 2011 on Fed optimism,"* Dow jumps 421 points, biggest pct gain since Dec. 2011 * S&P; 500 posts biggest daily pct gain since Jan. 2013 * Tech leads the gain; Oracle up after results * Indexes up: Dow 2.4 pct, S&P; 2.4 pct, Nasdaq 2.2 pct   (Updates close with further comments, VIX close) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Dec 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks surged on Thursday, extending a Federal Reserve-fueled rally from the previous session and giving the S&P; 500 its best two-day advance in three years. The rally follows the Fed’s commitment on Wednesday to take a “patient” approach toward raising interest rates while signaling it was on track to raise rates in 2015, which analysts said provided clarity and relief to investors over the policy outlook. The Dow jumped 421 points and recorded the best one-day percentage gain since December 2011. The S&P; 500 posted its biggest daily percentage gain since January 2013 and is up 4.5 percent for the last two sessions, making for its biggest two-day rise since November 2011. “The anxiety over the Fed meeting has abated for now, with the Fed using that word ‘patient’,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, which is based in Newark, New Jersey. “You had the beginning of the proverbial Santa Claus rally.” A 3-percent jump in the technology sector also helped Thursday’s advance. Oracle Corp climbed 10.2 percent to $45.35, a day after quarterly results topped Wall Street expectations. Shares of Apple  rose 3 percent to $112.65. Before the rally of the last two days, a selloff in oil and energy shares helped pushed the S&P; 500 down nearly 5 percent from its most recent record high on Dec. 5. “What happened this week was a game-changer. That easy money trade came to the forefront, and it’s so powerful it wipes out all of these concerns that exist,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 421.28 points, or 2.43 percent, to 17,778.15, the S&P; 500 gained 48.34 points, or 2.4 percent, to 2,061.23 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 104.08 points, or 2.24 percent, to 4,748.40. The S&P; energy sector gained 2.1 percent even as U.S. crude extended its selloff since June, ending down 4.2 percent. The S&P; energy sector is still down 11.2 percent for the year so far. Investors may still be trying to recover from those losses. “Some of those who were caught in the meat grinder of what happened with energy ... may be wanting to make up for performance now,” Krosby said. The CBOE Volatility Index dropped to 16.81 on Thursday from 19.44 on Wednesday, the second largest drop in December. The upcoming quadruple-witch expiration of index futures and options on Friday also could have been behind the late-day trading rally, BGC Partners Inc equity derivatives strategist Jared Woodard said. If options expire when the market is on the move, traders who are short out-of-the money options have to close or hedge their exposure, he said, which tends to exaggerate gains or losses. Volume this week has been well above the month’s average. On Thursday, about 8.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges compared with the 7.5 billion average this month, according to BATS Global Markets. NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 2,522 to 589, for a 4.28-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 2,093 issues rose and 655 fell, for a 3.20-to-1 ratio favoring advancers. Among the day’s gainers, Rite Aid shares surged 11.9 percent to $6.78 after the drugstore chain’s quarterly results topped expectations and it boosted its 2015 outlook.

241,ORCL,UPDATE 2-Oracle revenue rises 3.5 pct on strong growth in cloud,"(Adds context and detail) Dec 17 (Reuters) - Oracle Corp reported a 3.5 percent increase in quarterly revenue on Wednesday, beating Wall Street’s expectations, as sales at its closely watched cloud services business rose 45 percent. Shares of Oracles, whose report was the first since co-founder Larry Ellison stepped down as chief executive, rose 2.5 percent to $42.20 in after-market trading. Investors have been carefully watching how Oracle beefs up its cloud divisions, which deliver software over the Internet. Success on that front is a gauge for how well the company can fight off competition from cloud-software companies such as Salesforce.com Inc. “Oracle has been going through a transition as it rationalizes the hardware business and moves their software business to the cloud,” said Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicle. “This good evidence that they’re making some progress there.” Total revenue rose to $9.6 billion from $9.28 billion, beating analysts’ expectations of $9.51 billion. Revenue from cloud services totaled $516 million. The company broke a string of disappointing quarters in which revenue grew more slowly than expected. In September, the company promoted co-presidents Safra Catz and Mark Hurd to co-chief executives. Ellison, the co-founder, remains executive chairman and chief technology officer, and spoke extensively on a conference call with analysts Wednesday, particularly on Oracle’s growth in the cloud. “We think we will be number one in the cloud and will be number one in cloud very quickly,” Ellison said, interjecting after Hurd briefly answered an analyst’s question about cloud revenue. In 2008, Ellison called cloud computing “complete gibberish,” but in recent years, the company has tried to catch up by making a string of acquisitions. Hurd cited several new customers for Oracle’s cloud business, including Siemens,  Honeywell International Inc, and Johnson & Johnson. Nevertheless, “the company has some “wood to chop” in 2015 to accelerate top-line growth as its bread and butter database business remains under pressure,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. Oracle’s net income slipped to $2.50 billion in its fiscal second quarter, ended Nov. 30, from $2.55 billion a year earlier. On that basis, it earned 56 cents a share, the same as in the year-earlier quarter.  Before one-times items, it earned 69 cents per share, also the same as a year ago. Oracle built its name by selling on-premises hardware and software. New software license updates and supports remain by far the company’s biggest business, with revenue of $4.77 billion last quarter, followed by new software licenses and hardware systems.

246,ORCL,Ellison's backing helps Kurian's star to rise at Oracle,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Every Tuesday and Wednesday at around 2 pm, Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle Corp, gathers his lieutenants in the board room on the top floor of the software giant’s headquarters in Redwood City, California to hear engineers present new products and strategies. Several people who have attended the meetings over the years said all the top Oracle executives have assigned seats – including Ellison himself, the two co-CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd, and Thomas Kurian, who was appointed president of software development last week. But sometimes during these meetings, which last several hours, it is as if Ellison, 70, and Kurian, 47, are the only ones in the room, the people said. Ellison turns to Kurian for a second opinion and affirmation on product decisions, conversations that one former Oracle executive described as “rapid-fire exchanges”. “He always looks back at Thomas and says, ‘Thomas what do you think? Thomas let’s do that.’ It was something to watch them,” said the former executive. Kurian’s sway within Oracle, as evidenced by the dynamic in these meetings as well as his growing responsibilities, has some current and former company executives convinced that he will one day succeed Ellison and run the technology company, which has a market cap of about $190 billion. Even after Ellison named Hurd and Catz as co-CEOs in September, insiders said they believed Kurian was the man to watch at Oracle. One senior Oracle executive said that after Hurd and Catz were promoted, top executives worried about keeping Kurian motivated and happy. He continued to report directly to Ellison, now executive chairman of the board, along with Hurd, Catz and two others.  “He has Larry’s ear. He is his trusted soldier,” said another former Oracle executive. Oracle declined to comment for this story or make Ellison and Kurian available for interview. Ellison seems to be in no hurry to take a back seat. The billionaire is currently very actively involved with the company, and was even appointed Oracle’s chief technology officer in September, but he has in recent years spent an increasing amount of time on other interests, including his sailing team, and as he develops the Hawaiian island he largely controls into an eco-tourism destination.  Appointing the co-CEOs helps him delegate administrative and sales tasks that he has little interest in, the sources said. The sources say that when Ellison does eventually hand over the reins, he will want to entrust Oracle to someone who lives and breathes technology, and Kurian is seen fitting that job description best among the top executives. Kurian has always kept his plans close to his chest, and would often brush off rumors about succession with a smile, one of the sources said.   He is already well compensated. For the last fiscal year, Catz and Hurd made $37 million each. Kurian made $26.7 million, mainly through stock option awards, regulatory filings show. Outside technology circles and Oracle little is known about Kurian. In interviews, current and former Oracle executives provided insights into how the India-born engineer rose up the ranks and what may have kept him back from getting the corner office already. They painted a picture of a smart technologist who understands Oracle’s products inside out, works long hours, executes Ellison’s vision and has such little patience for small talk that some people think he is uncomfortable in one-on-one conversations. His biggest achievement so far is seen as building Oracle’s middleware business, the software plumbing that connects different parts of a computer network - such as the link between an operating system and applications used by businesses – into a substantial enterprise.  He is also credited for overseeing Oracle’s vast and still rapidly evolving suite of products, from business software applications to servers and databases. Now, Ellison has put him in charge of the company’s move to the cloud – the use of the Internet to run applications or store data - where it lags competitors. Success in the endeavor could give Kurian even more influence at the company, said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, who says the executive is extremely well regarded in technology circles. At the same time, the sources said Kurian’s management style has sometimes turned people off.  People who have worked with him over the years said he does not sufficiently delegate responsibility, which has increasingly become a problem as his mandate has grown over the years. Although his responsibilities have grown a lot, he still likes to get involved in the minutia of various projects, these people said.  Kurian was born in the southern Indian state of Kerala and was raised in Bangalore. He came to the United States in 1986, and went to Princeton for graduate school in electrical engineering.  He joined Oracle in 1996 after a brief stint as an associate at McKinsey & Co, the management consultancy firm. From there, Kurian quickly rose to become one of Ellison’s closest confidants. By the mid 2000s, Oracle was making a big push to build middleware into its next billion-dollar business, and Ellison picked Kurian to lead that effort. By fiscal 2006, the business achieved its goal and Kurian established himself as an executive to watch within Oracle, the sources said. His next project, however, was not that successful.  Oracle had made several multibillion-dollar acquisitions over the same period, including human resource software maker PeopleSoft and customer management applications maker Siebel, and plugged those assets under its applications business. In 2007, Ellison put Kurian in charge of integrating these different products.    But the project called Fusion, which cost billions of dollars, was marred by a series of delays, the sources said. And by the time Oracle was able to get its Fusion applications available to customers in 2011, the software world had started moving onto the cloud. Vendors such as Workday and Salesforce.com, for example, started taking market share from Oracle and other tech giants in human resource and customer relationship management applications.  Kurian’s new responsibilities for Oracle’s cloud business will put him in a position to even that score.

247,ORCL,UPDATE 3-SAP profit holds up in fourth quarter as cloud shift accelerates,"* Q4 op profit up 1 pct, broadly in line with Reuters poll avg * Says reaches goal for revenue from cloud services * Shares rise 4.5 pct to top of sector index   (Rewrites first paragraph, adds background, analyst comment) By Harro Ten Wolde and Eric Auchard FRANKFURT, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Germany’s SAP on Monday reported an accelerating shift by business customers to internet-delivered cloud software, as it eked out a 1 percent rise in operating profit for the fourth quarter thanks to stable demand for its more classic software. SAP reported operating profit, excluding special items, of 2.13 billion euros ($2.5 billion), broadly in line with an average forecast of 2.15 billion according to a Reuters poll of analysts. Shares of Europe’s largest software firm extended gains to close up 4.5 percent, leading a 1.7 percent rise in the European technology sector. SAP unnerved investors in October by cutting its profit forecast, blaming the higher initial costs required to deliver its software via the cloud, where revenue is realised over time rather than upfront as for packaged software. The shift to cloud software sales cut profit margins for the fourth quarter by 2.1 percentage points to 38.9 percent, below  company forecasts and analyst expectations. This was partly offset by strength in its mainstay packaged software, especially for maintenance services. “It seems that SAP was able to keep the balance between cloud growth and a stable software/support business,” Commerzbank analyst Thomas Becker wrote in a note to clients. The corporate software industry is undergoing a shift away from packaged software which customers run on their computers to software run via the Internet in remote datacenters, making data easier to manage, analyse and use not just on computers but also mobile phones and other devices. The German company needs to boost the proportion of its software sold via the cloud to defend its customer base from cloud-based competitors such as Salesforce.com and Workday Inc and better compete with arch-rival Oracle Corp. SAP said it had reached its full-year target for cloud-based software revenue, which rose 45 percent to 1.1 billion euros, suggesting that, at least for now, it is capable of expanding in the cloud market without further damaging its margins. Fourth-quarter cloud-based revenue jumped 72 percent, or 59 percent at constant currencies, fuelled by sales from Concur, the cloud-based travel-expenses software maker SAP bought last year for $7.3 billion. SAP’s cloud revenue accounted for 6.2 percent of 2014 sales. Oracle also reported a jump in cloud software sales of 45 percent to $516 million for its second quarter through November. That amounted to around 6 percent of total revenue. SAP will publish detailed results on Jan. 20. It has promised to spell out a growth plan for its major business lines through 2020.

248,ORCL,U.S. justices seek Obama administration views on Google-Oracle dispute,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court on Monday asked the U.S. government to weigh in on whether the justices should hear a closely watched copyright dispute between Google Inc and Oracle Corp over software used to design Google’s Android smartphone operating system. Oracle sued Google in 2010, claiming Google had improperly incorporated parts of its Java software into Android. Oracle is seeking roughly $1 billion on its copyright claims. The nine justices will take no further action on the case until U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli files court papers offering the views of President Barack Obama’s administration. The court is weighing whether to review a May 2014 ruling in favor of Oracle by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. There is no deadline for the government to file its papers. The case is Google Inc. v. Oracle Corp, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-410. The justices also asked the Obama administration to weigh in on a second case involving Google over whether it will have to defend claims that its Street View mapping software violates patents held by Vederi LLC after the Supreme Court declined to take up the company’s appeal. In March 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit threw out a district judge’s finding that Google had not infringed on four different patents. Vederi sued Google in 2010.

249,ORCL,U.S. justices seek Obama administration views on Google-Oracle dispute,"WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The Supreme Court on Monday asked the U.S. government to weigh in on whether the justices should hear a closely watched copyright dispute between Google Inc and Oracle Corp over software used to design Google’s Android smartphone operating system. Oracle sued Google in 2010, claiming Google had improperly incorporated parts of its Java software into Android. Oracle is seeking roughly $1 billion on its copyright claims. The nine justices will take no further action on the case until U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli files court papers offering the views of President Barack Obama’s administration. The court is weighing whether to review a May 2014 ruling in favor of Oracle by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. There is no deadline for the government to file its papers. The case is Google Inc. v. Oracle Corp, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-410. The justices also asked the Obama administration to weigh in on a second case involving Google over whether it will have to defend claims that its Street View mapping software violates patents held by Vederi LLC after the Supreme Court declined to take up the company’s appeal. In March 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit threw out a district judge’s finding that Google had not infringed on four different patents. Vederi sued Google in 2010. The company says Google infringed on its patents, which concern ways of creating images of a geographical area that can be navigated by computer. Street View is a product that enables users to navigate images of streets created from a series of photographic images taken by cameras positioned on top of cars. The case is Google Inc. v.

250,ORCL,RPT-INSIGHT-Ellison's backing helps Kurian's star to rise at Oracle,"(Repeating to additional subscribers) By Nadia Damouni NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Every Tuesday and Wednesday at around 2 pm, Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle Corp, gathers his lieutenants in the board room on the top floor of the software giant’s headquarters in Redwood City, California to hear engineers present new products and strategies. Several people who have attended the meetings over the years said all the top Oracle executives have assigned seats - including Ellison himself, the two co-CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd, and Thomas Kurian, who was appointed president of software development last week. But sometimes during these meetings, which last several hours, it is as if Ellison, 70, and Kurian, 47, are the only ones in the room, the people said. Ellison turns to Kurian for a second opinion and affirmation on product decisions, conversations that one former Oracle executive described as “rapid-fire exchanges”. “He always looks back at Thomas and says, ‘Thomas what do you think? Thomas let’s do that.’ It was something to watch them,” said the former executive. Kurian’s sway within Oracle, as evidenced by the dynamic in these meetings as well as his growing responsibilities, has some current and former company executives convinced that he will one day succeed Ellison and run the technology company, which has a market cap of about $190 billion. Even after Ellison named Hurd and Catz as co-CEOs in September, insiders said they believed Kurian was the man to watch at Oracle. One senior Oracle executive said that after Hurd and Catz were promoted, top executives worried about keeping Kurian motivated and happy. He continued to report directly to Ellison, now executive chairman of the board, along with Hurd, Catz and two others. “He has Larry’s ear. He is his trusted soldier,” said another former Oracle executive. Oracle declined to comment for this story or make Ellison and Kurian available for interview. Ellison seems to be in no hurry to take a back seat. The billionaire is currently very actively involved with the company, and was even appointed Oracle’s chief technology officer in September, but he has in recent years spent an increasing amount of time on other interests, including his sailing team, and as he develops the Hawaiian island he largely controls into an eco-tourism destination. Appointing the co-CEOs helps him delegate administrative and sales tasks that he has little interest in, the sources said. The sources say that when Ellison does eventually hand over the reins, he will want to entrust Oracle to someone who lives and breathes technology, and Kurian is seen fitting that job description best among the top executives. Kurian has always kept his plans close to his chest, and would often brush off rumors about succession with a smile, one of the sources said. He is already well compensated. For the last fiscal year, Catz and Hurd made $37 million each. Kurian made $26.7 million, mainly through stock option awards, regulatory filings show. Outside technology circles and Oracle little is known about Kurian. In interviews, current and former Oracle executives provided insights into how the India-born engineer rose up the ranks and what may have kept him back from getting the corner office already. They painted a picture of a smart technologist who understands Oracle’s products inside out, works long hours, executes Ellison’s vision and has such little patience for small talk that some people think he is uncomfortable in one-on-one conversations. His biggest achievement so far is seen as building Oracle’s middleware business, the software plumbing that connects different parts of a computer network - such as the link between an operating system and applications used by businesses - into a substantial enterprise. He is also credited for overseeing Oracle’s vast and still rapidly evolving suite of products, from business software applications to servers and databases. Now, Ellison has put him in charge of the company’s move to the cloud - the use of the Internet to run applications or store data - where it lags competitors. Success in the endeavor could give Kurian even more influence at the company, said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, who says the executive is extremely well regarded in technology circles. At the same time, the sources said Kurian’s management style has sometimes turned people off. People who have worked with him over the years said he does not sufficiently delegate responsibility, which has increasingly become a problem as his mandate has grown over the years. Although his responsibilities have grown a lot, he still likes to get involved in the minutia of various projects, these people said. Kurian was born in the southern Indian state of Kerala and was raised in Bangalore. He came to the United States in 1986, and went to Princeton for graduate school in electrical engineering. He joined Oracle in 1996 after a brief stint as an associate at McKinsey & Co, the management consultancy firm. From there, Kurian quickly rose to become one of Ellison’s closest confidants. By the mid 2000s, Oracle was making a big push to build middleware into its next billion-dollar business, and Ellison picked Kurian to lead that effort. By fiscal 2006, the business achieved its goal and Kurian established himself as an executive to watch within Oracle, the sources said. His next project, however, was not that successful. Oracle had made several multibillion-dollar acquisitions over the same period, including human resource software maker PeopleSoft and customer management applications maker Siebel, and plugged those assets under its applications business. In 2007, Ellison put Kurian in charge of integrating these different products. But the project called Fusion, which cost billions of dollars, was marred by a series of delays, the sources said. And by the time Oracle was able to get its Fusion applications available to customers in 2011, the software world had started moving onto the cloud. Vendors such as Workday and Salesforce.com, for example, started taking market share from Oracle and other tech giants in human resource and customer relationship management applications. Kurian’s new responsibilities for Oracle’s cloud business will put him in a position to even that score.

252,ORCL,Former HP chairman admits 'mistake' in venture firm sexism trial,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Onetime highflying tech executive Ray Lane testified on Monday during a sex discrimination trial involving his former employer, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, that he made a mistake in judgment involving the harassment of a female venture capitalist at the firm. Lane, who previously served as executive chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and president of Oracle Corp (ORCL.N), told the court that he erred in not immediately informing others that Trae Vassallo told him about unwanted advances by her colleague, Ajit Nazre, during a 2011 business trip. “I made a mistake,” he said. “It was my mistake. I cared more about her feelings than anything else. I thought it should be her choice” whether to tell others at the firm and start an investigation, he said. Whether Kleiner reacted appropriately to allegations of sexism is at the heart of the suit, filed by former partner Ellen Pao. The case, brought in 2012, helped spark a broad and ongoing discussion about gender issues in Silicon Valley. In the suit, Pao alleges she suffered discrimination and retaliation after Nazre pressured her into a 2006 affair which she soon ended.      Pao alleged in her lawsuit that Lane and other partners did not initially respond to her complaints. Eventually, Lane told her to consider marriage to Nazre, she said in her suit. The discriminatory conduct spread to other partners, leading her to miss out on a key promotion, she alleges. Vassallo, who testified in the case last week, said Lane had told her to be “flattered” by Nazre’s advances, although she later said she believed he was joking. But Kleiner did eventually start an investigation into Nazre’s actions after she told more partners. The firm has vehemently denied Pao’s allegations. Kleiner’s lawyer, Lynne Hermle, said in court last week that the firm treated women fairly and did not promote Pao because she lacked talent.  But Pao’s attorney, Alan Exelrod, said the firm systematically failed to promote women to senior investing partner. He said Pao excelled at her work, lining up patent firm RPX, which raised $160 million in an initial public offering, as an investment. Lane joined Kleiner Perkins in 2000, after leaving software giant Oracle. He championed Fisker Automotive, which raised $1.5 billion before declaring bankruptcy in 2013. Lane is now a partner emeritus at the firm.  The case is Pao v. Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers LLC, CGC-12-520719, in California Superior Court, in the County of San Francisco.

A unanimous, three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Friday agreed with Oracle attorney Marc Hearron of Morrison & Foerster in ruling that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office should not have invalidated all of the Oracle patent’s claims. The panel said the agency’s interpretation of the patent was faulty and sent it back for reconsideration.

261,ORCL,Oracle CEO sees benefit if rival buys Salesforce.com,"REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (Reuters) - Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) Chief Executive Safra Catz said her company could benefit if Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) or another rival bought online customer relationship management firm Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N). Oracle, Microsoft and Germany’s SAP (SAPG.DE) are the most likely candidates for such a big deal, according to analysts, which could top $50 billion and be the biggest software acquisition on record.  Each of the companies have declined to comment, but multiple sources familiar with their thinking have poured cold water on bid speculation. Catz declined to comment on whether Oracle had made an approach to buy Salesforce.com, following a report on Wednesday that Salesforce.com had hired advisers after receiving an offer from an unnamed suitor. If Microsoft or another rival did buy Salesforce.com, it might help Oracle in the customer relationship management sector, Catz said. “It would cause a lot of disruption in that market and so I would view that as something that would be helpful to us especially in the short or medium term, dependent on who it was.” Catz was speaking at a media event at Oracle’s headquarters in Silicon Valley on Thursday. Catz and her colleague Mark Hurd were both named CEO of Oracle in September, as co-founder and former CEO Larry Ellison took the titles of executive chairman and chief technology officer.  Oracle has spent more than $60 billion on more than 100 acquisitions in its 38-year history but is “not known to throw around money,” Catz said. The $190 billion market value company, which built its fortune on database systems and corporate software, is much bigger than Salesforce.com, which is worth about $46 billion. But it lags Salesforce.com in the fast-growing market for online customer relationship management (CRM), helping corporations organize and track sales calls and leads. Salesforce.com is No. 1 in the $23 billion a year CRM market, according to tech research firm Gartner, on track for about $6.5 billion in annual revenue this fiscal year.  Salesforce.com is entirely provided over the cloud with no software directly installed on PCs. Oracle and Microsoft, which were relatively late to the cloud model, have much smaller online CRM revenues, but do not break them out.  Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff has been a vocal critic of Oracle, Microsoft and SAP, goading them for their slow adoption of the cloud, which has divided opinion over the viability of an acquisition. “Personality is not a factor,” said Michael Maoz, an analyst at Gartner. “Marc Benioff is a consummate professional and fits in with world leaders, never mind software leaders.” (This version of the story adds background on Oracle and Microsoft) ",4302015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-salesforce-com-m-a-oracle/oracle-ceo-sees-benefit-if-rival-buys-salesforce-com-idUSKBN0NL2I920150430

Catz and her colleague Mark Hurd were both named CEO of Oracle in September, as co-founder and former CEO Larry Ellison took the titles of executive chairman and chief technology officer. Oracle has spent more than $60 billion on more than 100 acquisitions in its 38-year history but is “not known to throw around money,” Catz said. The $190 billion market value company, which built its fortune on database systems and corporate software, is much bigger than Salesforce.com, which is worth about $46 billion. But it lags Salesforce.com in the fast-growing market for online customer relationship management (CRM), helping corporations organize and track sales calls and leads. Salesforce.com is No. 1 in the $23 billion a year CRM market, according to tech research firm Gartner, on track for about $6.5 billion in annual revenue this fiscal year. Salesforce.com is entirely provided over the cloud with no software directly installed on PCs. Oracle and Microsoft, which were relatively late to the cloud model, have much smaller online CRM revenues, but do not break them out. Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff has been a vocal critic of Oracle, Microsoft and SAP, goading them for their slow adoption of the cloud, which has divided opinion over the viability of an acquisition. “Personality is not a factor,” said Michael Maoz, an analyst at Gartner. “Marc Benioff is a consummate professional and fits in with world leaders, never mind software leaders.” ",4302015,http://www.reuters.com/article/salesforcecom-ma-oracle/update-2-oracle-ceo-sees-benefit-if-rival-buys-salesforce-com-idUSL1N0XR2U320150430

264,ORCL,Google versus Oracle case exposes differences within Obama administration,"SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration has been locked in internal wrangling over what position to take in high profile litigation between two American technology giants, Google and Oracle, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions. It faces an end-of-May deadline to decide whether to take sides in a case before the U.S. Supreme Court that will have wide implications for the technology industry. The case involves how much copyright protection should extend to the Java programming language. Oracle won a federal appeals court ruling last year that allows it to copyright parts of Java, while Google argues it should be free to use Java without paying a licensing fee. Google, which used Java to design its Android smartphone operating system, appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court then asked the Obama administration in January for its opinion on whether it should take the case. The nine justices request that U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, Jr., the government’s top lawyer before the Supreme Court, weigh in on about 20 cases a year in which the federal government has a strong interest. The justices generally give greater weight to what he or she says than other third parties that take a side in a case, an influence which has caused the solicitor general to be dubbed the “tenth justice.” According to Google, an Oracle victory would obstruct “an enormous amount of innovation” because software developers would not be able to freely build on each others’ work. But Oracle says it is effective copyright protection that’s the key to software innovation. It is unclear what position the administration will ultimately take. Deliberations within the Obama administration have mirrored the larger debate in the technology world about how broadly copyright should apply to software, the sources said. Charles Duan, a lawyer for interest group Public Knowledge, that backs Google in the case, said he met with officials at the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice antitrust division to advance the view that Oracle is seeking a monopoly on software. “They were very interested in the competition implications of the case,” Duan said of the antitrust regulators. An FTC representative declined to comment. Another source briefed on the discussions said the solicitor general’s office has pushed back on pro-Google arguments. The debate is coming down to the wire as the solicitor general’s office, a division of the DOJ, usually files its opinions by the end of May to give the Supreme Court time to make a decision by the conclusion of its term at the end of June. A Department of Justice spokeswoman declined to comment. Google’s Android operating system is the world’s best-selling smartphone platform. Oracle sued Google in 2010, claiming that Google had improperly incorporated parts of Java into Android. Oracle is seeking roughly $1 billion on its copyright claims. The case examined whether computer language that connects programs (known as application programming interfaces, or APIs) can be copyrighted. A San Francisco federal judge decided that the Java APIs replicated by Google were not subject to copyright protection and were free for all to use. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed that, saying it was bound to respect copyright protection for software “until either the Supreme Court or Congress tells us otherwise.” Google has a close relationship with President Barack Obama’s administration, and executive chairman Eric Schmidt has long been a high profile supporter of the president’s. However, there is no indication that the internal debate on software copyright involves any issues beyond legal policy. Legal teams from both Oracle and Google made separate presentations to government officials in March, a third source familiar with the meetings said. The company pitches attracted so much interest from different government agencies that they had to be moved to a larger conference room at the Department of Justice to accommodate all the lawyers, this source said. Some of the administration’s technology advisers have been advocating the pro-Google position as well, the second source said. This week, the White House appointed Edward Felten as deputy U.S. Chief Technology Officer. Felten, a computer scientist, signed onto a legal brief last November urging the Supreme Court to hear Google’s appeal. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Representatives for Oracle and Google declined to comment. Meanwhile the U.S. Copyright Office, a division of the Library of Congress, is known as being pro-copyright which could make it more likely to back Oracle, according to a lawyer for groups that support Google. The Copyright Office declined to comment. Other technology companies, including Yahoo and Hewlett-Packard, filed legal briefs at the Supreme Court supporting Google, arguing that the Federal Circuit ruling “upset settled expectations about the scope of copyright law.” Yet Oracle argued that the Supreme Court should decline the case because the Federal Circuit applied settled legal doctrine. “Google’s argument - that the code lost all copyright protection because it became popular and Google wanted Android to be popular, too - would not fly for any other work,” Oracle’s attorneys wrote.

The case involves how much copyright protection should extend to the Java programming language. Oracle won a federal appeals court ruling last year that allows it to copyright parts of Java, while Google argues it should be free to use Java without paying a licensing fee. Google, which used Java to design its Android smartphone operating system, appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court then asked the Obama administration in January for its opinion on whether it should take the case because the federal government has a strong interest.

But Oracle says effective copyright protection is the key to software innovation. In the court filing on Tuesday, U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli said Google’s argument that the code is not entitled to copyright protection lacks merit and did not need to be reviewed by the Supreme Court. Verrilli added that Google had raised important concerns about the effect that enforcement of Oracle’s copyright could have on software development, but said those issues could be addressed via further proceedings on Google’s separate “fair use” defense in San Francisco federal court. The Supreme Court could better assess the issues, Verrilli said, if it had all relevant legal arguments before it at the same time.

271,ORCL,"Oracle sales, profit miss estimates; shares fall","(Reuters) - Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) forecast quarterly profit below analysts’ estimates, and said weak sales of its traditional database software licenses were made worse by a strong U.S. dollar that lowered the value of foreign revenue.

Shares of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Salesforce.com (CRM.N), two of Oracle’s closest rivals, were close to unchanged. “This was an ugly print and speaks to the headwinds Oracle is seeing in the field as their legacy database business is seeing slowing growth,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. “While cloud has seen pockets of strength, overall the excuses we see out of Oracle have continued to frustrate the Street.” Oracle, like other established tech companies, is looking to move its business to the cloud-computing model, essentially providing services remotely via data centers rather than selling installed software.  The 38-year-old company has had some success with the cloud model, but is not moving fast enough to make up for declines in its traditional software sales. Oracle, along with German rival SAP (SAPG.DE), has been losing market share in customer relationship management software in recent years to Salesforce.com, which only offers cloud-based services. Because of lower software sales and the strong dollar, Oracle’s net income fell to $2.76 billion, or 62 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended May 31, from $3.65 billion, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 78 cents per share, below the 86 cents expected by Wall Street, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 5.4 percent to $10.71 billion. Revenue rose 3 percent on a constant currency basis. Analysts had expected revenue of $10.92 billion, on average. Sales from Oracle’s cloud-computing software and platform service, an area keenly watched by investors, rose 29 percent to $416 million. For the current quarter, Oracle forecast earnings of 56 cents to 59 cents per share, below analysts’ average estimate of 61 cents. It estimated revenue growth of 5 percent to 8 percent over the year-ago quarter, excluding any change in the value of the dollar.

273,ORCL,US STOCKS-Wall St ends higher in choppy post-Fed trading,"* Fed says economy strong enough to handle rate hike * Oracle slides after the bell on revenue miss * FedEx down after results * Indexes up: Dow 0.17 pct, S&P; 0.2 pct, Nasdaq 0.18 pct   (Updates to close) By Rodrigo Campos June 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended slightly higher following a choppy session Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said the U.S. economy is likely strong enough to withstand an interest rate hike later this year. Even if a majority of Fed officials continue to see higher rates by the end of 2015, they expect rates to rise slightly less by the end of 2016 and 2017 than they did in their March forecasts. That view on rates saw high-yielding stocks gain, with the S&P; 500 utilities sector up 0.9 percent after hitting on Tuesday its lowest since late September. Stocks with higher dividend yields attract investors when there is an expectation that Treasury yields will fall, or in this case, remain relatively low. “The Fed is talking about the labor market tightening somewhat, which seems to be a hint that it is a step closer to raising rates. At the same time, it seems like there was a notching down of the magnitude of rate hike expectations,” said Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at Invesco PowerShares in Downers Grove, Illinois. “Those two things are what is causing stocks to go back and forth.” Major indexes were volatile following the Fed statement. Stocks initially added to losses, then hit session highs as Fed Chair Janet Yellen spoke to the media in a follow-up to the statement. They lost more than half the day’s gains at the close. The S&P; 500 has hovered near the 2,100 level for more than a month as sentiment shifts between hopes for a stronger economy and fears of the effect of rising rates coupled with high valuations. At the closing bell on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 31.26 points, or 0.17 percent, to 17,935.74, the S&P; 500 gained 4.15 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,100.44 and the Nasdaq Composite added 9.33 points, or 0.18 percent, to 5,064.88. At its session high, the S&P; had been up 0.5 percent. Adding to support for equities, investors have seen the proximity of rising rates as a trigger for more M&A; activity, with mergers and acquisitions already at record levels. Away from the Fed, FedEx fell 3 percent to $176.73 after the package delivery firm reported a quarterly net loss. Oracle shares fell nearly 7 percent in after-hours trading after the enterprise software and computer hardware company missed revenue expectations. During regular market hours, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,606 to 1,446, for a 1.11-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,441 issues fell and 1,301 advanced for a 1.11-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The S&P; 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 145 new highs and 34 new lows.

The Fed cut its economic growth forecasts for 2015 because of a weak start to the year. Even if a majority of Fed officials continue to see higher rates by the end of 2015, they expect rates to rise slightly less by the end of 2016 and 2017 than they did in their March forecasts. In a press conference following the end of the Fed’s two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said she wanted “more decisive evidence” that labor markets were healing, and that wages would increase beyond their current “subdued pace.” Yellen added that the Fed remains data-dependent, which will prompt investors to keep a sharper eye on the data in the coming months, especially on the monthly employment report. “If we see the kind of jobs data that we saw last month, that would keep the Fed on path to raise rates once in September and may be again in December,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. U.S. consumer prices in May recorded their largest increase in more than two years as gasoline prices surged. The Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent last month after gaining 0.1 percent in April. Other data showed the labor market continued to tighten as first-time applications for unemployment benefits declined last week to a near 15-year low.

Hopes of a breakthrough at Thursday’s gathering of European finance ministers, once seen as the last opportunity for an agreement, looked increasingly remote.

Worries about the Greek crisis and its potential impact on the rest of the euro zone more than offset the more positive sentiment coming from Wall Street, where U.S. shares ended slightly higher after a more dovish-than-expected message from the Federal Reserve.

285,ORCL,U.S. top court declines to hear Google appeal in Oracle Java fight,"WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) won a major legal victory on Monday in a closely watched copyright case involving the company’s Java programing language as the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Google Inc’s (GOOGL.O) appeal.  The decision upholds a ruling that allows Oracle to seek licensing fees for the use of some of the Java language. Google had said it should be able to use Java without paying a fee. The case involves how much copyright protection should extend to Java. Google, which used Java to design its Android smartphone operating system, said in court papers that an Oracle victory would obstruct “an enormous amount of innovation” because software developers would not be able to build freely on each others’ work. The litigation now returns to a San Francisco federal court for more proceedings on Google’s separate “fair use” defense.  “We will continue to defend the interoperability that has fostered innovation and competition in the software industry,” Google said in a statement on Monday.  Oracle, however, has said effective copyright protection is the key to software development. General Counsel Dorian Daley said on Monday that the Supreme Court decision was a “win for innovation.”  Google’s Android operating system is the world’s best-selling smartphone platform. Oracle sued Google in 2010 and is seeking roughly $1 billion on its copyright claims. The case examined whether application programing interfaces, which connect programs, can be copyrighted. A San Francisco federal judge decided that the Java APIs replicated by Google were not subject to copyright protection and were free for all to use. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed that last year, saying it was bound to respect copyright protection for software “until either the Supreme Court or Congress tells us otherwise.” Shares of Google were down about 1.1 percent at $525.74 in early trading, while Oracle was down about 0.6 percent at $40.74. The Obama administration, which was asked to weigh in on the issue earlier this year, asked the Supreme Court not to take the case. The administration said the dispute had raised important concerns about the effect that enforcement of Oracle’s copyright could have on software development, but said those issues could be addressed via Google’s fair use defense. The case is Google v. Oracle, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-410.",6292015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-google/u-s-top-court-declines-to-hear-google-appeal-in-oracle-java-fight-idUSKCN0P91O720150629

293,ORCL,"Anaplan targets SAP, Oracle in fast-growing business planning market","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Business planning software start-up Anaplan is nipping at the heels of industry leaders SAP, Oracle and IBM, with sales of its cloud-based service tripling in each of the past three years as it seeks to shake up the market.  Customers are demanding more flexible ways to use business planning software, which crunches corporate data to allow companies to forecast growth and set performance goals. While major players like SAP, Oracle’s Hyperion business and IBM’s Cognos and Applix units have been forced to offer cloud-based products, their focus has remained on packaged software as it makes up the bulk of their revenue. This has opened the door to nimbler rivals focused solely on cloud-based software in the fast-growing market.  “There is a major shift going on and Anaplan is at the forefront,” Forrester business apps analyst Paul Hamerman said. “It appears to be the fastest-growing vendor in this space and the one which already has good traction with large companies.” Anaplan is backed by cloud market leaders Salesforce and Workday, both as investors and by integrating their sales and marketing and human resource products. The company, which was founded in a north England farmhouse in 2006, is considering a stock-market listing in the coming year, although it said its rapid growth in customers and revenue gave it room to be patient. “We are really going after ‘global 2,000’ companies,” Laurent Lefouet, Anaplan’s managing director for Europe, Middle East and Africa said in an interview. As of January, it had signed up users at 300 companies, two-thirds of them global firms, he added. Lefouet said Anaplan was on track to sign up 150,000 users this year, and should triple that number in 2016, putting it in reach of 1 million users by 2017 or 2018, he said. By contrast, SAP and Oracle count tens of million of cloud software users, although these numbers include a far broader set of products. While Anaplan, now based in San Francisco, could consider an initial public offering (IPO) in the coming year, it is focused on its next milestone of signing up 1 million users, or an average of 1,000 users across 1,000 global accounts, Lefouet said. However, business software analyst Hamerman said it was more likely that small cloud players would be bought up by bigger rivals than go public.  Traditional, non cloud-based, planning software suffers from high costs and inflexible design, while customers are “locked in” by vendors as software switching costs are high, Hamerman said. But customer demands are changing rapidly, he added. Anaplan offers users a cloud-based service that processes billions of spreadsheet cells of corporate data on central computers, then illustrates the results in charts and graphics within a user’s web browser. Its closest rivals are U.S.-based Adaptive and Host Analytics. Industry experts say that what separates Anaplan from many of its competitors - both large and small - is the way it twins sophisticated data analysis and modeling with a relatively simple interface that allows its software to be used by managers across corporate departments, without lots of tech support. Hamerman said the business planning market was currently worth around $3 billion in annual sales, spread across 15 to 20 players. But Anaplan said its potential audience was 20 percent of all corporate employees, a far bigger market that it said could be worth upward of $20 billion in the long run.  Business planning tools, an outgrowth of accounting systems finance teams use to manage corporate budgets, are now being used by sales and marketing teams to forecast targets, and human resources or operations to set performance goals. Anaplan said it had recently begun to see adoption of such software by thousands of users in big corporate names such as Hewlett-Packard, Intel’s McAfee unit, VMware and consumer groups Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser and Kimberly-Clark. Anaplan and its peers decline to disclose revenue figures. But a calculation based on the 45,000 customers Anaplan says it has signed up combined with an estimated average annual subscription fee comparable to Salesforce.com’s roughly $1,000, suggests revenue is nearing $50 million (45 million euros). The Yorkshire-founded, Silicon Valley-financed and French executive-led firm has raised around $150 million to date, with its latest funding round of $100 million led by Draper Fisher Jurvetson and including Sands Capital, Brookside, Bain Capital, along with Salesforce and Workday.

298,ORCL,Oracle revenue forecast disappoints as license sales continue falling,"(Reuters) - Oracle Corp’s (ORCL.N) sales fell more than expected in the first quarter, hurt by a strong dollar and a continued drop in licensed software sales and the company warned revenue could fall in the current quarter even on a constant currency basis. Like its rivals such as SAP (SAPG.DE), IBM Corp (IBM.N) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Oracle is striving to boost Internet-based software sales to head off fast-growing competitors such as Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N). But, analysts have said Oracle’s cloud software business has not been growing fast enough to make up for declines in the 38-year-old company’s licensed software business due to reasons ranging from slow customer adoption to tough competition. Oracle’s revenue declined 1.7 percent to $8.45 billion in the quarter ended Aug. 31, missing analysts estimates for the third quarter in a row. The company said sales increased 7 percent on a constant currency basis. However, it forecast revenue to range between a fall of 2 percent to growth of 1 percent in the current quarter. “On an apples-to-apples basis, that’s disappointing. It’s pretty clearly below consensus even at the top end,” Wedbush Securities Inc analyst Steve Koenig said. Oracle’s shares fell as much as 2.8 percent in extended trading on Wednesday. The company’s net income declined 20 percent to $1.75 billion in the first quarter. Excluding items, it earned 53 cents per share, more than analysts’ estimate of 52 cents. Sales of Oracle’s cloud-computing software and platform service rose 34 percent to $451 million. Sales of traditional software licenses fell 16 percent to $1.51 billion. Wall Street was expecting cloud-based sales to increase 35 percent and licensed software sales to decline 17 percent, according to RBC Capital Markets. “In the foreseeable future the database business continues to be a dark cloud over the company’s head,” FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said. Cloud-based software sales account for a small portion of Oracles’ total revenue as they are subscription based, which promise a steady revenue stream but with lower margins. Fundamentally, all of Oracle’s software will be available on the cloud by the OpenWorld conference at the end of October, Co-Chief Executive Mark Hurd said on a call with analysts. Ives said Oracle needs to make acquisitions to fuel growth in its cloud business and convince investors who are sceptical of a turnaround.

301,ORCL,Shares of Oracle jump on upgrade ahead of quarterly report,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oracle Corp’s (ORCL.N) beleaguered shares jumped 1.1 percent on Wednesday after an analyst upgraded them ahead of the fiscal first-quarter report card that will shed light on the enterprise software heavyweight’s shift toward cloud computing. SunTrust upgraded Oracle’s stock to “buy” from “neutral” ahead of its fiscal first-quarter report due after the bell. Four decade-old Oracle faces ruthless competition from more youthful companies flogging inexpensive enterprise services delivered via the Internet, including Salesforce.com (CRM.N), Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Workday WDAY.N.    Analysts have applauded Oracle’s attempts to quickly expand its own cloud offerings but some have worried that new focus may hurt the company’s traditional, lucrative business of charging customers to run Oracle software in their own data centers. That fear was underscored in June, when Oracle’s fourth-quarter results showed revenue dropped 5 percent even as cloud services grew about 29 percent, but still accounted for only 5 percent of overall revenue. “We believe that the market confusion surrounding Oracle’s emerging cloud business and its impact on its existing businesses, while warranted, is clouding Oracle’s long-term potential,” wrote SunTrust analyst John Rizzuto in a note to clients explaining his upgrade.  For its first quarter, which ended in August, analyst on average expect EPS of 52 cents and a 1 percent dip in revenue to $8.53 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Oracle has missed earnings estimates by at least 3 percent in half of the past eight quarters. After fourth-quarter results fell short of consensus, chief executive Safra Catz told analysts on a conference call they “missed the boat” on the effect of the strong dollar, which has cut into the revenue of U.S. companies that sell abroad. Oracle shares jumped as high as $38.52 on Wednesday, but retraced some of those gains to trade at $38.31, up 32 cents or 0.84 percent at 1:40 p.m. EDT. Shares of Oracle have lost 7 percent over the past year while Salesforce.com (CRM.N) has gained 24 and Netsuite N.N has risen 8 percent.  Oracle trades at 14 times expected earnings, compared to 82 for Salesforce.com. Of older tech companies also trying to break into cloud computing, Microsoft (MSFT.O) trades at 16 times earnings and International Business Machines (IBM.N) trades at 9 times earnings.  Oracle options were busy on Wednesday with about 29,000 contracts traded by 12:15 p.m. ET, about twice the normal pace, according to Trade Alert.  September puts at strike prices of $38 and $37 were the busiest near-term contracts, suggesting options traders may expect the stock to fall after it reports.

303,ORCL,NY state pension fund sues Oracle for political donor info,"(Reuters) - New York state’s public pension fund has sued Oracle Corp to force the tech giant to reveal how it spends its political donations, according to a court filing. The New York State Common Retirement Fund, which manages $184.5 billion, has been urging large public companies to disclose political donations. It said more than 142 S&P; 500 companies have done so, but Oracle has so far declined. Three years ago, the fund brought a similar lawsuit, which was the seen as the first of its kind, that eventually forced wireless chip company Qualcomm Inc to disclose its political expenditures. The fund, which said it owns $380 million of Oracle stock, filed its lawsuit late Tuesday in the Court of Chancery in Delaware, where Oracle is incorporated. According to the complaint, Oracle executives including co-founder and Executive Chairman Larry Ellison are major political donors, raising concerns that corporate funds may be spent in ways that harm stockholders. “Whether willfully or innocently, the same executives may allow personal political viewpoints and preferences to influence the decisions whether and how to allocate corporate funds in the political arena,” said the complaint. An Oracle spokeswoman declined to comment. The lawsuit comes as both political parties gear up for the 2016 presidential election, expected to be the costliest ever. Political spending has risen dramatically since the U.S. Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling in 2010 essentially lifted restrictions on political donations by corporations and unions. The New York pension fund is overseen by state comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, a Democrat. The complaint said research shows that companies that spend heavily on political contributions often perform poorly. Oracle, the world’s biggest database firm, is struggling to move its business toward an Internet-enabled model. Its shares are down about 14 percent this year. The lawsuit cited as a potential concern Ellison’s fundraising for Republican presidential candidates, Florida Senator Marco Rubio and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. Oracle had in 2007 reached an agreement with shareholder activists to disclose political contributions. But the lawsuit charges that the company violated that accord last year by failing to identify the person deciding political donations, or disclose whether corporate funds were channeled through intermediaries such as trade groups. The pension fund said Oracle refused its request for that information.

321,ORCL,Oracle buys Israeli cloud company Ravello,"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Business software maker Oracle Corp, which is seeking to expand its cloud business, has agreed to buy Israeli cloud software company Ravello Systems, the two firms said on their websites on Tuesday. While the size of the deal was not disclosed, Israeli media reported it was between $400 million and $450 million. Officials at Ravello and Oracle declined to comment. Ravello, which was founded in 2011 and employs about 60 people, has raised $54 million, with its largest shareholders being Norwest Venture Partners, Sequoia Capital and Bessemer Venture Partners. Oracle said all Ravello employees would join Oracle as part of Oracle Public Cloud. Ravello will accelerate Oracle’s ability to help customers move complex applications to the cloud, Ravello Chief Executive Rami Tamir said on his company’s website.  Cloud computing enables services to be delivered to companies over the Internet rather than them having to maintain expensive infrastructure in-house.

322,ORCL,Oracle buys Israeli cloud company Ravello,"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Business software maker Oracle Corp, which is seeking to expand its cloud business, has agreed to buy Israeli cloud software company Ravello Systems, the two firms said on their websites on Tuesday. While the size of the deal was not disclosed, Israeli media reported it was between $400 million and $450 million. Officials at Ravello and Oracle declined to comment. Ravello, which was founded in 2011 and employs about 60 people, has raised $54 million, with its largest shareholders being Norwest Venture Partners, Sequoia Capital and Bessemer Venture Partners. Oracle said all Ravello employees would join Oracle as part of Oracle Public Cloud. Ravello will accelerate Oracle’s ability to help customers move complex applications to the cloud, Ravello Chief Executive Rami Tamir said on his company’s website.  Cloud computing enables services to be delivered to companies over the Internet rather than them having to maintain expensive infrastructure in-house.

323,ORCL,"UPDATE 2-Elliott buys large Qlik stake, eyeing sale to bigger buyer","(Reuters) - Elliott Management Corp bought a large stake in Qlik Technologies Inc, saying on Thursday that shares are cheap and the data analytics company is ripe for being taken over by a larger technology peer. Elliott, a $27 billion hedge fund founded by billionaire Paul Singer, said in a securities filing that it owned 8.8 percent of the U.S. company, a position Elliott paid around $200 million to purchase. Elliott said Qlik shares are significantly undervalued and that there are “strategic and operational opportunities” for the company that would boost its stock. “We believe Elliott could push for a sale of the company to one of the stack vendors, such as IBM or Oracle Corp.,” investment bank William Blair said in a research note, referring to firms that make hardware and software components needed for applications to run. William Blair, which rates the company an “outperform” said Qlik could fetch a 40 percent plus premium from a buyer. Elliott’s broad range of investments across the tech industry are overseen by Jesse Cohn, 35, who led previous investments in companies such as Compuware Corp, Riverbed Technology Inc. and Blue Coat Systems Inc, to name a few. All three were ultimately purchased by private equity firms. With market volatility taking a heavy toll on the private equity financing market, Elliott’s thesis for its Qlik investment shows how the hedge fund will lean more on strategic buyers for an exit opportunity rather than a leveraged buyout. Elliott started buying Qlik shares earlier this year, paying an average of $23.50 per share, for a total of 8.3 million shares, according to its filing.  Qlik, which began as a Sweden-based company and is now headquartered in Radnor, Pennsylvania, saw its shares jump 7 percent on Wednesday to $25.88 on the Nasdaq. Its stock is down more than 40 percent since mid-August. ""This situation is as classic as an Elliott activist situation gets - small to mid-cap technology company that has strategic opportunities,"" Ken Squire, of 13D Monitor, said in a note. Squire, who runs an activist mutual fund and also monitors activist investor filings, said that Elliott could also offer to buy Qlik itself. Elliott is now Qlik's largest shareholder.(1.usa.gov/1Y5oaWG) Qlik declined to comment.

The company’s shares rose about 4 percent in extended trading. Oracle has been investing aggressively in its Internet-based software business over the last few years in a bid to take market share away from rivals such as Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) and Workday Inc WDAY.N. “Our cloud business is now in a hyper-growth phase,” Safra Catz, Oracle’s co-chief executive, said in a statement. Revenue from its cloud-computing software and platform service rose about 57 percent to $583 million, accounting for about 6 percent of its total revenue.  The company said it added 942 new customers for its cloud software service in the quarter, including several who switched from Workday Inc WDAY.N.  “Overall, we believe these results highlight how ORCL’s cloud business is reaching an inflection point, after multiple quarters of seemingly ‘kicking the can,’” BTIG analyst Joel Fishbein said in an e-mail.  Net income fell to $2.14 billion, or 50 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Feb. 29, from $2.50 billion, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company reported a profit of 64 cents per share. Revenue fell 3.4 percent to $9.01 billion. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 62 cents per share on revenue of $9.12 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Oracle’s shares were trading at $40.29 after the bell.

340,ORCL,Capital Group leaders look to rein in inflated CEO pay,"BOSTON (Reuters) - The usually close-mouthed Capital Group is speaking up on executive pay - throwing more brickbats than bouquets.  In a recent interview, leaders of the $1.4 trillion Los Angeles-based investment manager said they worry about the magnitude of pay for chief executives and question whether corporate boards are using the right benchmarks to determine compensation.  “There has been this continued escalation where everybody wants to be in the upper quartile,” Alan Berro, senior portfolio manager at Capital Group, told Reuters. “Once one guy raises it, they all want those raises, and we are willing to say no,” he said. Berro’s comments are important because Capital Group, which oversees the big American Funds mutual fund family, is one of the largest holders of U.S. stocks and is emerging as one of the toughest critics of corporate compensation. A measure is its voting record on what are known as “say-on-pay” resolutions - non-binding measures which let shareholders vote on whether to approve compensation for top executives. Last year, big mutual fund providers including BlackRock Inc and Vanguard Group voted in support of say-on-pay resolutions of S&P; 500 companies at least 96 percent of the time, according to research firm Proxy Insight. Capital Group, however, was less generous in its support, with its funds supporting the pay 86 percent of the time, one of the lowest rates among big U.S. fund managers. Executive pay, which has been a source of controversy for some time, has drawn more scrutiny amid stagnant U.S. wages for the typical worker. Median pay among S&P; 500 CEOs rose to $11.3 million in 2014 from $9.4 million in 2010, according to pay consultant Farient Advisors. Capital Group has rarely spoken about its proxy voting before, but decided to offer more explanation because of growing interest in the area, including from financial advisers and institutional investors, executives said. Like other asset managers, Capital Group says executive pay should be linked to performance. But proxy voting principles Capital recently posted online also have an unusual caveat about “preventing excess” pay. In making pay judgments, Berro said, “We always come back to fairness, and what makes sense in the given circumstances.” Berro and others at Capital declined to single out individual companies whose pay packages they view as problematic. A  securities filing shows the $140 billion Growth Fund of America mutual fund voted “against” pay at two of the fund’s 10 largest holdings last year: Broadcom Corp and Oracle Corp, historically among the higher-paying technology firms. (Broadcom is now part of Broadcom Ltd.) Top holdings of its Capital World Investors unit include Microsoft Corp, Amazon Inc and Home Depot Inc, according to securities filings tracked by edgar-online.com. Capital World has a stake of at least 4.5 percent in each of those companies, and other Capital Group units hold additional shares. Lately, the firm has been building up a database to track topics like how companies’ executive pay compares to peers, and to what extent stock grants to executives have diluted outside shareholders, Berro said. Berro helps oversee investment selection among a wide range of blue-chip companies that are now entering the season for annual meetings. Not all of Capital Groups’ votes will please corporate critics. Its funds opposed nearly all proposals calling for companies to report on climate change, for instance. Berro said regulators are better-positioned than shareholders to oversee such matters.     Capital Group has also gained a reputation in some quarters as being activist-friendly - for instance, backing some  dissident nominees to DuPont’s board last spring. But Capital Group senior counsel Walt Burkley said his firm does not recruit activists to target companies for changes. “There is no call to activism from us,” he said.

341,ORCL,Little risk for Google in retrial vs Oracle over Android,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Even if a jury orders Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google to pay the full $8.8 billion sought by Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) in an upcoming San Francisco copyright trial over the Android operating system, shareholders and analysts say it will likely have little impact on the search giant’s bottom line. Oracle claims Google’s Android violated its copyright on parts of the Java programming language, while Google says it should be able to use Java without paying a fee under the fair-use provision of copyright law.  The case previously went to trial in 2012, but a jury deadlocked. If the new jury, in the trial starting on Monday, rules against Google on fair use, then it will consider damages.  Google took in $75 billion in revenue in 2015, so even a large verdict for Oracle would have little impact on investors because it would be a one-time charge, said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners, which holds shares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company.  Oracle is also seeking an injunction against Google’s future use of Java in Android, which would give Oracle more leverage to negotiate an ongoing royalty. However, such an injunction would have to be issued by a judge, not a jury, and legal experts believe that is a remote possibility. After the first trial, U.S. District Judge William Alsup ruled that the material at issue in the case should not be subject to copyright at all. A federal appeals court reversed that ruling, however, saying that the structure of the computer language that connects programs can be protected.  An Oracle representative did not respond to a request for comment, and a Google spokesman declined to comment. A damages expert hired by Oracle estimated that Google has taken in $29 billion in gross advertising and search revenue from Android devices since their inception, according to court documents, plus an additional $11.6 billion in sales of apps and Android phones. Oracle’s expert then calculated Android profits at $11.4 billion, of which he concluded Oracle is entitled to $8.8 billion.  However, Google says Oracle has vastly overstated Java’s role in the success of Android.    In a ruling this week, Alsup said Oracle’s damages expert will be allowed to testify about the $8.8 billion figure but cannot tell jurors they should award the entire amount.

342,ORCL,Ford invests $182.2 million in software company Pivotal,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (F.N) is investing $182.2 million in San Francisco-based Pivotal Software, underscoring the pressure carmakers face to boost their technology platforms given the rise of connected and self-driving cars. The investment in Pivotal, a cloud-software company which provides tools that make it easier for developers to build software, will help Ford boost its own software capabilities. As part of the deal, Ford and Pivotal will jointly open labs in the United States and Europe where their engineers will work side by side. While Pivotal does not make the software at the heart of self-driving car technology, Ford chief executive Mark Fields said he expected benefits from the partnership to flow to all product-development and information-technology teams at Ford, including those working on autonomous cars. For example, Pivotal can help Ford speed up its software-development times, he said in an interview. Ford’s investment, part of a $253 million funding round into Pivotal, comes a day after Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) said they would collaborate on creating autonomous minivans. In March, General Motors Co (GM.N) spent $1 billion on Cruise Automation, whose best-known product aims to add self-driving technology onto traditional cars.  “This is not about catching up or one upping the competition,” Fields said. “We have had leadership in (autonomous vehicles) for some time now.”  Ford is on track for a fleet of 30 autonomous cars by year end, a Ford spokesman said, second only to Google’s test fleet of autonomous cars. In general, Ford has provided few public details on its plans for self-driving cars. Software maker Microsoft Corp.(MSFT.O) is also investing in the funding round for Pivotal, which had been considered a 2016 IPO candidate when this year’s market for initial public offerings looked more promising. Pivotal’s tools are popular with software developers who use the Oracle-owned (ORCL.N) Java platform, so a tighter relationship with Pivotal could give Microsoft’s Azure cloud developer-tools service an advantage among that group, often software developers at big businesses.  IBM’s (IBM.N) cloud business, also attractive to Java users, could now face tougher competition as a result of the deal. Existing Pivotal investors General Electric Co (GE.N), EMC Corp EMC.N and VMWare Inc (VMW.N) are participating in the funding round, which gives Pivotal a valuation of $2.8 billion after the new cash infusion, a person familiar with the funding round said.  Besides its Cloud Foundry developer-tools business, Pivotal also provides data analytics and runs a consulting arm called Pivotal Labs.

343,ORCL,"Google, Oracle compete for innovation label in Android retrial","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oracle Corp and Google faced off on Tuesday in a $9 billion copyright retrial, with Oracle accusing Google of stealing programming to become the world’s leading smartphone player and Google saying it acted legally as a true innovator. Oracle claims Google’s Android smartphone operating system violated its copyright on parts of the Java programming language, while Alphabet Inc’s Google says it should be able to use Java without paying a fee under the fair-use provision of copyright law. The dispute previously went to trial in 2012, but a jury deadlocked. If the new jury in San Francisco federal court rules against Google on fair use, then it will consider Oracle’s $9 billion damages request. The case has been closely watched by software developers who fear an Oracle victory could spur more software copyright lawsuits. However, investors see little risk for Google because the company could afford to pay a one-off fine, and the possibility of an injunction that would force Google to pay ongoing royalties to Oracle appears remote. In court on Tuesday, Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt testified that he always believed Google could freely use Java because Schmidt personally unveiled the programming language in 1995 when he was a top executive at Sun Microsystems, which invented it. Oracle subsequently acquired Sun. Oracle argues that Google improperly used Java to quickly deliver an Android smartphone to market. Under cross examination, Schmidt acknowledged that he had been on Apple’s board and felt “strategic pressure” from the iPhone in 2007. Under U.S. copyright law, “fair use” allows limited use of material without acquiring permission from the rights holder for purposes such as research. Oracle attorney Peter Bicks said about 100,000 Android smartphones will have been activated by the time he finished his hour-long opening statement. That translated into $42 billion in revenue, he said, and all those phones contained Oracle’s property. Google’s defense cannot cover what they did with Java, Bicks said, calling it the “fair-use excuse.” Google attorney Robert Van Nest said fair use allows a company to use copyrighted material to make money, so long as the company adds something innovative. Google’s talented engineers were responsible for developing Android, not a tiny portion of Java owned by Oracle, he said. “They want all the credit for Android’s success, and apparently billions of dollars in damages, but the evidence isn’t going to support that,” Van Nest said in opening statements.",5102016,http://www.reuters.com/article/oracle-alphabet-trial/google-oracle-compete-for-innovation-label-in-android-retrial-idUSL2N187157

The dispute previously went to trial in 2012, but a jury deadlocked. If the new jury in San Francisco federal court rules against Google on fair use, then it will consider Oracle’s $9 billion damages request. The case has been closely watched by software developers who fear an Oracle victory could spur more software copyright lawsuits. However, investors see little risk for Google because the company could afford to pay a one-off fine, and the possibility of an injunction that would force Google to pay ongoing royalties to Oracle appears remote.  In court on Tuesday, Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt testified that he always believed Google could freely use Java because Schmidt personally unveiled the programming language in 1995 when he was a top executive at Sun Microsystems, which invented it. Oracle subsequently acquired Sun. Oracle argues that Google improperly used Java to quickly deliver an Android smartphone to market. Under cross examination, Schmidt acknowledged that he had been on Apple’s board and felt “strategic pressure” from the iPhone in 2007. Under U.S. copyright law, “fair use” allows limited use of material without acquiring permission from the rights holder for purposes such as research.   Oracle attorney Peter Bicks said about 100,000 Android smartphones will have been activated by the time he finished his hour-long opening statement. That translated into $42 billion in revenue, he said, and all those phones contained Oracle’s property.  Google’s defense cannot cover what they did with Java, Bicks said, calling it the “fair-use excuse.” Google attorney Robert Van Nest said fair use allows a company to use copyrighted material to make money, so long as the company adds something innovative. Google’s talented engineers were responsible for developing Android, not a tiny portion of Java owned by Oracle, he said. “They want all the credit for Android’s success, and apparently billions of dollars in damages, but the evidence isn’t going to support that,” Van Nest said in opening statements.

346,ORCL,Oracle paints Google as unfair competitor in retrial over Android,"SAN FRANCISCO, May 10 (Reuters) - An attorney for Oracle Corp told jurors on Tuesday that Alphabet Inc’s  Google deliberately took Oracle’s intellectual property without permisson, kicking off a $9 billion retrial. Oracle claims Google’s Android violated its copyright on parts of the Java programming language, while Google says it should be able to use Java without paying a fee under the fair-use provision of copyright law. The case previously went to trial in 2012, but a jury deadlocked. If the new jury in San Francisco federal court rules against Google on fair use, then it will consider Oracle’s $9 billion damages request. In court on Tuesday, Oracle attorney Peter Bicks said about 100,000 Android smartphones will have been activated by the time he finished his hour-long opening statement, and 3 billion phones had been activated since the lawsuit began. That translated into $42 billion in revenue, he said, and all those phones contained Oracle’s valuable property. “You do not take somebody’s property without permission and use it for your own benefit,” Bicks said. He said Google’s defense cannot cover what they did with Java, and called it the “fair-use excuse.” Under U.S. copyright law, “fair use” allows limited use of copyrighted material, without acquiring permission from the rights holder, for purposes such as research, commentary or news reporting. Google has argued that the elements of Java at issue should not be subject to copyright at all, and even if they are, Oracle has vastly overstated its damages claim. An attorney for Google is expected to deliver opening statements later on Tuesday, and Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt is set to be Google’s first witness.

347,ORCL,Oracle co-CEO says it did not buy Sun Micro to sue Google,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) did not acquire Sun Microsystems in 2009 in order to launch a copyright lawsuit against Google, but rather to protect its products that relied on Sun’s software, Oracle co-Chief Executive Safra Catz told jurors on Monday. In a trial at San Francisco federal court, Oracle (ORCL.N) claims Google’s Android smartphone operating system violated its copyright on parts of the Java programing language.

However, an Oracle attorney asked Catz about emails from 2009, in which former Sun CEO Jonathan Schwartz described a dispute with Google over Java. “He told us that they’d been talking with Google and had been trying to get them to license Java,” said Catz, noting that Android was an unauthorized version of Java because Google did not have a license.

351,ORCL,Oracle co-CEO says Google caused Oracle revenue to plummet,"(Reuters) - Longtime customers dramatically reduced the amount of licensing revenue they paid to use Oracle products after Google stole its copyrighted software to enter the smartphone market, Oracle’s co-chief executive Safra Catz told jurors on Tuesday.  In a trial at San Francisco federal court, Oracle Corp has claimed Google’s Android smartphone operating system violated its copyright on parts of Java, a development platform. Alphabet Inc’s Google unit said it should be able to use Java without paying a fee under the fair-use provision of copyright law. Oracle acquired Sun in 2010 and sued Google after negotiations over its use of Java broke down. The jury was deadlocked in a trial in 2012, and if the current jury rules against Google on fair use, then it would consider Oracle’s request for $9 billion in damages. The case has been closely watched by software developers who fear an Oracle victory could spur more software copyright lawsuits. In court on Tuesday, Catz said the decision by Google to distribute Android for free to phone manufacturers like Samsung undercut traditional licensing revenue those manufacturers paid for Java.  “It had a very negative impact,” Catz said. Samsung, for instance, reduced payments from about $40 million to about $1 million, Catz said.  Amazon had traditionally used Java to develop its Kindle reader, Catz said, but switched to Android for the Fire. When Amazon was developing a new reader, the Paperwhite, Catz said Oracle was forced to offer a 97.5 percent discount to entice Amazon to use Java. Google has attempted to portray itself as a true innovator and claims Oracle only turned to the courts because it could not succeed in the market. Under questioning from a Google attorney, Catz acknowledged that Oracle had considered developing its own phone but did not pursue the project.  Jurors viewed an internal Oracle memo on its phone project, which concluded that Oracle had “very limited internal expertise to make smart decisions.” Oracle has argued that Google violated basic moral principles by using elements of Java without a license. During her testimony, Catz said she encountered Google general counsel Kent Walker at a bat mitzvah in 2012. According to Catz, Walker approached her and said: “You know Safra, Google is a really special company and the old rules don’t apply to us.” “And I immediately said: thou shalt not steal, it’s an oldie but it’s a goodie,” Catz said.",5172016,http://www.reuters.com/article/oracle-alphabet-trial/oracle-co-ceo-says-google-caused-oracle-revenue-to-plummet-idUSL2N18E178

355,ORCL,Larry Page spars with Oracle attorney at Android trial,"(Reuters) - Google did not pay to use Oracle’s software in millions of smartphones, but the company believed that the intellectual property was free for anyone to use, Larry Page, chief executive of Google’s parent company, told jurors in court on Thursday. In a retrial at San Francisco federal court, Oracle Corp  has claimed Google’s Android smartphone operating system violated its copyright on parts of Java, a development platform. Alphabet Inc’s Google unit said it should be able to use Java without paying a fee under the fair-use provision of copyright law.

However, investors see little risk for Google because the company could afford to pay a one-time fine, and the possibility of an injunction that would force Google to pay ongoing royalties to Oracle appears remote. Page, whose vocal cords have been affected by a previous medical condition, spoke quietly into the microphone. “Sorry I’m a little bit soft,” he said to jurors. Oracle attorney Peter Bicks sharply questioned Page about the importance of Android to Google’s business, pointing to documents noting billions of dollars in revenue, as well as earnings transcripts in which Page said 700,000 Android phones were “lit up” every day. “Yes, I already testified I think Android is significant to Google,” said Page, who testified for about a half hour. Bicks asked Page if Google paid Oracle for the use of Java, which was developed by Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s and acquired by Oracle in 2010. “I think when Sun established Java it was established as an open source thing,” Page said. Bicks repeated the question. “No we didn’t pay for the free and open things,” Page said. Under questioning from Google attorney Robert Van Nest, Page said Google’s use of Java was consistent with widespread industry practice. “I think we acted very responsibly and carefully around the intellectual property issues,” Page said.",5192016,http://www.reuters.com/article/oracle-alphabet-trial/larry-page-spars-with-oracle-attorney-at-android-trial-idUSL2N18G16Y

361,ORCL,Google beats Oracle in $9 billion Android trial,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. jury handed Google  a major victory on Thursday in a long-running copyright battle with Oracle Corp over Android software used to run most of the world’s smartphones. The jury unanimously upheld claims by Google that its use of Oracle’s Java development platform to create Android was protected under the fair-use provision of copyright law, bringing trial to a close without Oracle winning any of the $9 billion in damages it requested. Oracle said it saw many grounds to appeal and would do so. “We strongly believe that Google developed Android by illegally copying core Java technology to rush into the mobile device market,” Oracle General Counsel Dorian Daley said in a statement. Alphabet Inc’s Google in a statement called the verdict “a win for the Android ecosystem, for the Java programming community, and for software developers who rely on open and free programming languages to build innovative consumer products.” The trial was closely watched by software developers, who feared an Oracle victory could spur more software copyright lawsuits. Google relied on high-profile witnesses like Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt to convince jurors it used Java to create its own innovative product, rather than steal another company’s intellectual property, as Oracle claimed. In the retrial at U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Oracle said Google’s Android operating system violated its copyright on parts of Java. Alphabet’s Google unit said it should be able to use Java without paying a fee under fair use. A trial in 2012 ended in a deadlocked jury. Shares of Oracle and Alphabet were little-changed in after-hours trade following the verdict. After the first trial, U.S. District Judge William Alsup ruled that the elements of Java at issue were not eligible for copyright protection at all. A federal appeals court disagreed in 2014, ruling that computer language that connects programs - known as application programming interfaces, or APIs - can be copyrighted. A flood of copyright lawsuits has failed to materialize in the two years since that federal appeals court ruling, suggesting Oracle’s lawsuit will not ultimately have a wide impact on the sector. Under U.S. copyright law, “fair use” allows limited use of material without acquiring permission from the rights holder for purposes such as research. During retrial, Oracle attorneys deemed Google’s defenses the “fair-use excuse.”   (Additional reporting by Dan Levine)",5262016,http://www.reuters.com/article/oracle-alphabet-verdict/google-beats-oracle-in-9-billion-android-trial-idUSL2N18N1NY

367,ORCL,Salesforce takes aim at e-commerce with $2.8 billion Demandware buy,"(Reuters) - Cloud-based software maker Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) said on Wednesday it would buy Demandware Inc DWRE.N, whose software is used by businesses to run e-commerce websites, for about $2.8 billion. The deal would help Salesforce open a new front as it seeks to take more market share from traditional software providers such as Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) and SAP AG (SAPG.DE), both of which already offer cloud-based e-commerce services. The e-commerce market has been growing at a blistering pace as retailers expand their online presence, boosting demand for software that helps manage functions such as payment processing and inventory management. Salesforce’s cash offer of $75.00 per share represents a 56.3 percent premium to Demandware’s Tuesday closing. The lofty premium indicates that multiple bidders were likely at the table for Demandware, Stifel Nicolaus & Co analyst Thomas Roderick said, naming Adobe Systems Inc ABDE.O and Oracle as the other possible contenders. “We’re not winning every deal, this is just the deal that we were actually able to get done,” Salesforce Chief Executive Marc Benioff told CNBC in an interview. Demandware’s shares, which have fallen about 21 percent in the past year, rose 55.9 percent to $74.81 on Wednesday. Shares of Salesforce, considered a barometer for the cloud-computing industry, edged down 0.3 percent. Demandware, whose customers include Lands’ End Inc (LE.O),  L’Oreal SA (OREP.PA) and Marks and Spencer Group Plc (MKS.L), has reported sales growth of more than 30 percent for the last 10 quarters. “I think Salesforce has effectively already won the CRM war - they need to stay out front in terms of innovation and they do need to have the broadest, deepest portfolio ... this was a blind spot for them,” Wedbush Securities analyst Steve Koenig said. Global spending on digital commerce platforms is expected to grow over 14 percent annually to about $8.5 billion by 2020, Salesforce said, citing research firm Gartner.     The deal, slated to close in Salesforce’s second quarter ending July, is expected to increase the company’s 2017 revenue by about $100 million-$120 million. Salesforce had forecast fiscal 2017 revenue of $8.16 billion-$8.20 billion in May. However, Salesforce said it now expected an adjusted profit of 93 cents-95 cents per share for the full year, down from its previous forecast of $1-$1.02.

Demandware, whose customers include Lands’ End Inc (LE.O),  L’Oreal SA (OREP.PA) and Marks and Spencer Group Plc (MKS.L), has reported sales growth of more than 30 percent for the last 10 quarters. “I think Salesforce has effectively already won the CRM war - they need to stay out front in terms of innovation and they do need to have the broadest, deepest portfolio ... this was a blind spot for them,” Wedbush Securities analyst Steve Koenig said. Global spending on digital commerce platforms is expected to grow over 14 percent annually to about $8.5 billion by 2020, Salesforce said, citing research firm Gartner.     The deal, slated to close in Salesforce’s second quarter ending July, is expected to increase the company’s 2017 revenue by about $100 million-$120 million. Salesforce had forecast fiscal 2017 revenue of $8.16 billion-$8.20 billion in May. However, Salesforce said it now expected an adjusted profit of 93 cents-95 cents per share for the full year, down from its previous forecast of $1-$1.02. BofA Merrill Lynch is Salesforce’s financial adviser for the deal, while Goldman Sachs is advising Demandware.

370,ORCL,Oracle hit with whistleblower lawsuit over cloud accounting,"(Reuters) - Oracle Corp was sued on Wednesday by a former senior finance manager who claimed she was terminated in retaliation for complaining about improper accounting practices in Oracle’s cloud services business. Shares of Oracle fell about 2.6 percent to $39.23 in after-hours trading. In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, the former executive, Svetlana Blackburn, accused upper management of trying to push her to “fit square data into round holes” to make Oracle Cloud Services’ results look better. “We don’t agree with the allegations and intend to vigorously defend the matter,” Oracle spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger said. Blackburn said her bosses instructed her to add millions of dollars of accruals for expected business “with no concrete or foreseeable billing to support the numbers,” and said executives above her added accruals on their own. Like many legacy software companies, Oracle faces a dilemma with the move to cloud computing - essentially software in servers in data centers accessible through the internet rather than traditional packaged software. The older type of software still generates massive profits for Oracle. Last quarter, Oracle’s traditional on-premises software sales shrank slightly compared with a year earlier, but still generated $6.35 billion in revenue, 70 percent of total revenue for the quarter. In comparison, cloud revenue was $735 million, or 8 percent of the revenue, but grew by 40 percent. The Redwood City, California-based company has come under considerable pressure from younger and smaller cloud-first companies such as Salesforce.com Inc, whose chief executive delights in mocking Oracle’s cloud strategy. Oracle has invested aggressively in its cloud business over the last few years in a bid to gain market share in the cloud. Safra Catz, Oracle’s co-chief executive, said in March that the cloud business was in a “hyper-growth phase.” Blackburn said Oracle terminated her employment on Oct. 15 last year, one month after the alleged wrongdoing began and two months after she received a positive performance review. She said Oracle had come to view her as “more of a roadblock than a team player who would blindly generate financial reports using improper bases in order to justify the bottom lines that her superiors demanded to see.” V.J. Chetty, a lawyer for Blackburn, declined additional comment. Blackburn’s lawsuit also accused Oracle of violating the anti-retaliation provisions of the federal Sarbanes-Oxley corporate governance and Dodd-Frank financial-reform laws. It seeks punitive damages, double back pay and other remedies.

375,ORCL,Oracle's cloud strength boosts quarterly revenue,"(Reuters) - Business software maker Oracle Corp reported a higher-than-expected quarterly revenue as sales in its cloud business surged due to more customers. Shares of the Redwood City, California-based company rose as much as 3.8 percent to $40.10 in extended trading on Thursday. Like its rivals such as SAP SE, IBM Corp and Microsoft Corp, Oracle has focused on moving its business toward the cloud-computing model, essentially providing services remotely via data centers rather than selling installed software. Total revenue from the company’s cloud-computing software and platform service rose 49.1 percent to $859 million in the fourth quarter ended May 31. It contributed 8 percent of Oracle’s total revenue during the quarter. Oracle expects the business to grow more than 65 percent in fiscal 2017, higher than the 52 percent growth it saw in 2016, co-Chief Executive Safra Catz said on a conference call. The company also expects first quarter adjusted profit of 56-60 cents per share and revenue to grow between 2-5 percent in constant currency, Catz said. The company added more than 1,600 new cloud software as a service (SaaS) customers and more than 2,000 new platform as a service (PaaS) customers in Q4, Oracle Chief Executive Mark Hurd said. Oracle executives were bullish about its cloud prospects, and Safra Catz said the company was a “force to be reckoned with in the cloud”. Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison also said he expects the “hyper-growth” experienced by the company’s cloud business in 2016 will continue for the next few years. The 39-year old company, a late entrant into the cloud market, recently acquired cloud companies Textura and Opower. However, Oracle has come under considerable pressure from nimbler companies in the industry such as Salesforce.com Inc, whose chief executive Marc Benioff has constantly taken potshots at the company. The company’s total revenue fell 1 percent to $10.59 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $10.47 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Oracle’s net income rose to $2.81 billion, or 66 cents per share, in the quarter ended May 31, from $2.76 billion, or 62 cents per share, a year earlier.

382,ORCL,Oracle's cloud business takes lead in Latin America,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Oracle Corp is selling more cloud-based business software than traditional licensed products in Latin America, executives said on Tuesday, underscoring how remote computing has spurred demand from smaller businesses in new markets. Chief Executive Officer Mark Hurd said the cloud business, which stores enterprise software and data on remote servers, lets Oracle sell to clients without the budget for hardware or qualified staff, which can be tough to find in emerging markets. Although Oracle’s cloud business contributed just 8 percent of total revenue in the latest quarter, the segment’s 49 percent growth from a year earlier helped to offset sales declines in its on-premise licensing business. “One of the benefits of cloud is that you can now offer capabilities to a much broader set of customers,” Hurd said at an event in São Paulo.  “We become the IT staff; we become the data center,” Hurd said. “So you’ll see that we made a whole bunch of investments in Latin America, in Brazil, to move downmarket at the same time as we continue to call up the biggest customers in the country.” Oracle expects to gain “a ton of market share” in Brazil, Hurd said, adding that hiring has become easier during the current downturn. The company built its first Latin American data center in Brazil last year and has since made about 400 hires, expanding staff by more than 30 percent in a year. Luiz Meisler, Oracle’s most senior executive in Latin America, said the company had “thousands” of cloud clients in the region and aimed to have more than 5,000 this time next year.

386,ORCL,Fitch Affirms Oracle's Ratings 'A+'/'F1'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for Oracle Corp.  (Oracle), including the Long- and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) at  'A+'/'F1', respectively. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch's affirmation  affects $57.1 billion of debt, including the $3 billion undrawn revolving credit  facility (RCF) expiring 2018 and $3.75 billion outstanding under a separate RCF  that was repaid at maturity in June 2016. A full list of rating actions follows  at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's ratings and Outlook reflect the following expectations: Resumption of Revenue Growth: Fitch expects operating performance will  strengthen from robust Oracle cloud adoption driving the resumption of overall  top-line growth. Cloud represented only 8% of consolidated revenues in fiscal  2016 but Fitch's Rating Case incorporates hyper-growth through the intermediate  term. Layered on top of update and support revenue growth (more than 50% of  consolidated revenue) offsetting continued double-digit revenue declines for new  on-premise licenses (20% of consolidated revenue ), Fitch expects  mid-single-digit software growth. Hardware and Services (20% of consolidated  revenue combined) should reduce consolidated revenue by 100-200 basis points  through the forecast period.  Solid Financial Flexibility: Fitch expects Oracle's financial flexibility will  remain solid from robust recurring free cash flow (FCF) and significant overseas  cash, despite increasing debt over the intermediate term to fund domestic cash  shortfalls. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $56.4 billion  as of May 31, 2016, $7.9 billion of which was held in the U.S. The company also  has an undrawn $3 billion RCF expiring 2018 that fully backstops a commercial  paper (CP) program and Fitch expects roughly $10 billion of annual FCF over the  intermediate term, just under half of which Fitch estimates is in the U.S. Significant Recurring Revenue: Fitch expects significant recurring revenue from  Oracle's large installed customer base, high attach-and-renewal rates (ARR) and  software support. Despite our expectations for ongoing double-digit declines for  New Software License revenue through the intermediate term, Software License  Updates & Product Support (more than half of fiscal 2016 total revenues) should  continue its positive low- to mid-single-digit growth, driven by application  modernization (on-premise to SaaS) and support. Strong Competitive Position: Fitch believes Oracle's strong positions across key  as-a-service markets (enterprise resource, human resource, supply chain and  manufacturing, data and marketing), significant database and middleware  installed base capable of running on-premise and in the cloud uniquely positions  Oracle as a one-stop-shop cloud service provider. Oracle faces significant  competition from strong and fast-growing but more focused as-a-service players,  including Salesforce.com, Inc. (Salesforce), currently the largest SaaS provider  with a significant lead in sales and service clouds, and Workday, Inc.  (Workday), as well as historical on-premise competitors, including SAP AG, also  rapidly expanding cloud offerings. As a result, Fitch believes accelerating  cloud revenue growth to be first to $10 billion in cloud revenues from $2.9  billion for fiscal 2016 is critical to Oracle's longer-term success, given  Fitch's expectations for secular declines in on-premise, significant switching  costs and high customer retention rates for cloud services and customer and  product diversification. Lower Cloud Profit Margins: While Fitch expects the resumption of top-line  growth in fiscal 2017 will drive operating EBITDA expansion, an increasing mix  of lower gross margin cloud sales will weigh on profit margins. Fitch expects  Oracle's recent cloud investments in growth capacity and sales efficiency to  drive gross margin from a Fitch estimated 48% in fiscal 2016 (versus 96% for  on-premise). Still, Oracle may be challenged to achieve its 80% cloud gross  margin target in the intermediate term, which, if successful, would put it  meaningfully ahead of competitors, Salesforce (mid-70%s) and Workday (low-70%s). Significant Shareholder Returns: Fitch expects shareholder returns will remain  significant and approximate annual pre-dividend FCF, in the absence of large  domestic acquisitions. Mid-single-digit annual dividend growth is expected with  the remainder of pre-dividend FCF for share repurchases. Oracle has $8.8 billion  remaining under the current $10 billion share repurchase authorization approved  on March 15, 2016, and has bought back $28.3 billion of common stock over the  last three years ($22.9 billion net of proceeds from the issuance of common  stock). Fitch anticipates the company will fund shareholder returns with  incremental borrowing, given a Fitch-estimated 55% of FCF is overseas. Historically Acquisitive: Despite expectations for strong organic cloud growth,  Fitch believes acquisition risk remains elevated, given management's focus on  winning the cloud and premium valuations for as-a-service companies. Fitch  expects smaller tuck-in acquisitions aimed at strengthening cloud capabilities  are more likely than blockbuster deals, although aggregate spending could be  significant. Most cloud targets are in the U.S., potentially resulting in  debt-financed deals that may not be meaningfully additive to profitability in  the 12-18 months following the transaction's close. Fitch expects Oracle will  curtail share repurchases if acquisitions are expected to result in elevated  leverage beyond the near term. Supplemental Adjusted Net Leverage: Fitch expects incremental borrowing to plug  domestic cash shortfalls will weigh on gross credit protection measures over  time. We expect Oracle will avoid repatriating meaningful offshore cash to the  U.S., given it would trigger significant tax liabilities. Pro forma for today's  $14 billion senior notes issuance, Fitch estimates total leverage (debt to  operating EBITDA) will be roughly 3x, up from 2.6x for fiscal 2016. However,  supplemental adjusted net leverage (total debt netted against adjusted  cash/operating EBITDA) will be and remain near 1.5x through the forecast period,  compared to 1.1x for fiscal 2016. Fitch expects Oracle will use a portion of the  senior notes issuance to refinance upcoming maturities, which include $3.75  billion of bank debt expiring in the current quarter and $6 billion of bond  maturities in fiscal 2018.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Robust cloud services growth of more than 65% for fiscal 2017 and the addition  of $1.5 billion of cloud revenues through the remainder of the forecast period.  --Mid-teen revenue declines in new on-premise licenses through the forecast  period from ongoing migration to the cloud. --Low-single-digit revenue growth in Software License Updates and Product  Support revenue from support adoption for cloud services growth. --Hardware and Services revenue reduce overall top-line growth by 100-200 bps  from ongoing cloud adoption. --Flat Fitch estimated gross profit margin at just under 80% despite increasing  mix of lower gross profit margin cloud service sales. --Operating EBITDA expands to the high 40%s, versus a Fitch estimated 45% for  fiscal 2016, from operating leverage, given the company's rapid growth and more  efficient go-to-market sales strategy. --Capex is roughly 3% of revenue, driven primarily by the company's investments  in land acquisition. --Shareholder returns approximate annual FCF, with dividend growth of 5% and the  remainder for share repurchases. --Incremental debt will plug domestic cash shortfalls. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive rating actions are unlikely, given what Fitch believes is a strategic  rationale for a higher rating at the expense of financial flexibility required  for acquisitions and shareholder returns. However, management's commitment to  maintain supplemental adjusted net leverage below 1x over the longer term and  Fitch's expectations Oracle will be first to achieve $10 billion of cloud  services, which Fitch believes would support the company's win the cloud  strategy, could result in positive rating action. Negative rating actions could occur if: --Fitch expects Oracle will sustain supplemental adjusted net leverage above 2x  and total leverage above 3x from incremental borrowings to fund domestic cash  shortfalls in conjunction with lack of profitability growth;  --Fitch expects annual FCF sustained near or below $5 billion due to negative  revenue growth or structurally lower profitability from less competitive cloud  service offerings. LIQUIDITY Fitch expects Oracle's liquidity will remain solid. As of May 31, 2016 liquidity  was supported by: --$56.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which  all but $8 billion was located outside the U.S. and would be subject to  significant taxation if repatriated;  --$3 billion CP program fully back-stopped by a $3 billion RCF. Fitch's expectations for $10 billion of annual FCF through the intermediate term  also supports liquidity, of which Fitch assumes just under half is generated  inside the U.S. Total debt at May 31, 2016 was $43.9 billion and consisted of: --$3.75 billion of RCF due June 2016; --$2.5 billion of 1.20% senior notes due October 2017; --$1 billion of floating rate senior notes due July 2017; --$2.5 billion of 5.75% senior notes due April 2018; --$500 million of floating rate senior notes due January 2019; --$1.5 billion of 2.375% senior notes due January 2019; --$1.75 billion of 5% senior notes due July 2019; --$750 million of floating rate senior notes due October 2019; --$2 billion of 2.25% senior notes due October 2019; --$1 billion of 3.875% senior notes due July 2020; --$1.7 billion of 2.25% senior notes due January 2021; --$1.5 billion of 2.8% senior notes due July 2021; --$2.5 billion of 2.5% senior notes due May 2022; --$2.5 billion of 2.50% senior notes due October 2022; --$1 billion of 3.625% senior notes due July 2023; --$2 billion of 3.4% senior notes due July 2024; --$2.5 billion of 2.95% senior notes due May 2025; --$1 billion of 3.125% senior notes due July 2025; --$500 million 3.25% senior notes due May 2030; --$1.75 billion of 4.3% senior notes due July 2034; --$1.25 billion of 3.9% senior notes due May 2035; --$1.25 billion of 6.50% senior notes due April 2038; --$1.25 billion of 6.125% senior notes due July 2039; --$2.25 billion of 5.375% senior notes due July 2040; --$1 billion of 4.5% senior notes due July 2044; --$2 billion of 4.125% senior notes due May 2045; --$1.25 billion of 4.375% senior notes due May 2055. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch affirms Oracle's ratings as follows: --Long-Term IDR at 'A+'; --RCF at 'A+'; --Senior Unsecured Debt at 'A+'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F1'; --CP at 'F1'. Fitch also rates today's $14 billion senior notes issuance 'A+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

388,ORCL,US high-grade bounces back quickly after Brexit,"NEW YORK, June 30 (IFR) - The US high-grade market roared back to life this week with big deals from Molson Coors and Oracle that got a warm welcome from investors clamoring for paper after a bit of a drought. Investors piled US$31bn of orders into Tuesday’s US$5.3bn offering from Molson Coors, the first deal in the US primary market after Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. The trade ended what had been a week-long hiatus and did so with a bang, as the brewer was able to price some of the bonds through its curve - and then see them tighten in secondary. Software giant Oracle jumped in the following day, pricing a US$14bn mega-deal in a session that saw more than US$20bn of deals in all, helping soothe worries about a Brexit contagion. In fact, borrowers locked in some of the lowest levels in months thanks to a sharp drop in underlying Treasury yields and a less than commensurate widening in corporate spreads. And that should mean issuance will keep rolling next week after syndicate desks return from the US July 4 holiday. “Overall, issuers are paying lower coupons by and large than they were before the Brexit vote,” a syndicate banker on the Oracle deal told IFR. Molson pulled in pricing by 30bp-45bp across all four tranches, offering negative 10bp to flat concessions. Oracle’s deal, its biggest ever, also came very cheap. The Oracle 10-year priced with a coupon of 2.65% - 30bp lower than the 2.95% it paid on 10-year debt that priced just over a year ago. The 30-year came with a coupon of 4%, also below the 4.125% it paid on a similarly dated deal last year. “[Oracle’s strategy] was to focus on the coupons,” said the syndicate banker. “It’s the lowest has ever printed.” In part because of the negative yields on offer elsewhere - especially in Europe and Japan - the US high-grade market appears to be the buyside’s current destination of choice. And the strong levels of demand are helping provide a cushion for spreads, which immediately blew out 10bp in the wake of the Brexit vote to T+164bp. By Wednesday they had narrowed back in to T+162bp, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data, even after the week’s US$31.4bn supply. That should also help spur new volume, which syndicate desks say will be some US$85bn-$95bn in July. The primary also looks to get a boost from what have been consistently strong technicals. US high-grade funds saw a net outflow of nearly US$639m for the week ended June 29, according to Lipper data, but that was the first time cash has left the asset class since early March. And more foreign buyers are expected in the market after the Brexit vote. Bank of America Merrill Lynch credit strategists said Wednesday was the most active day of foreign buying in June. “There’s no question there was strong demand from outside the US before,” one investor said. “But since Brexit, investors buying in regions are looking wherever they can find yield. US dollar credit is definitely one place to find it.” The Brexit vote seems to have eradicated worries about a Fed rate hike, with Fed fund futures now pricing in zero chance of a hike this year and just one rate hike in 2017. But issuers sill have some urgency about bringing new deals sooner than later, not least because of the potential volatility as the US presidential election in November draws near. A second syndicate banker said he expected July to be volume heavy “because there will be a volatile second half of the year with the election and the Fed”. And the typical August slowdown may not take place either, said the investor. “This year may be different than prior years because the first [presidential election] debates start in September,” the investor said. “This fall we’ll be talking about nothing but the election unless someone pulls ahead in the polls.”   (Reporting by Hillary Flynn; Editing by Natalie Harrison and Marc Carnegie)",6302016,http://www.reuters.com/article/uscorpbonds-issuance/us-high-grade-bounces-back-quickly-after-brexit-idUSL1N19M1MM
389,ORCL,Oracle ordered to pay HP $3 bln in Itanium case,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A California jury ordered Oracle Corp to pay Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co $3 billion in damages in a case over HP’s Itanium servers, an Oracle spokeswoman said on Thursday. Oracle said it would appeal the verdict. The Itaniuum processor is made by Intel Inc. Oracle decided to stop developing software for use with HP’s Itanium-based servers in 2011, saying that Intel made it clear that the chip was nearing the end of its life and was shifting its focus to its x86 microprocessor. But HP said it had an agreement with Oracle that support for Itanium would continue, without which the equipment using the chip would become obsolete. In the first phase of trial in 2012, Santa Clara Superior Court Judge James Kleinberg ruled that there had been a contract.

393,ORCL,Oracle to gain cloud clout with NetSuite deal; Ellison profits,"(Reuters) - Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) said on Thursday it would buy NetSuite Inc N.N for about $9.3 billion, a deal that gives it a bigger share in the fast-growing cloud computing business and also means a big payday for billionaire Larry Ellison. In addition to being Oracle’s executive chairman, entities Ellison beneficially owns hold about 40 percent of NetSuite’s shares as of February, according to a regulatory filing. These would be worth about $3.5 billion if the deal closes. Corporate governance consultants said his links to both companies would increase scrutiny of the deal, but added its structure and strategic sense for Oracle meant it would likely pass. “People care (about governance) when someone makes the wrong decision,” said Kevin McManus, vice president of Egan-Jones Proxy Services. “But if the merger makes sense for the market, it’s going to be hard to complain too much.”  NetSuite shares closed up about 18 percent at $108.41, just shy of the offer price of $109 a share in cash. Oracle shares rose 0.6 percent at $41.19. “It’s definitely pricey from Oracle’s perspective, but it’s understandable and it’s justifiable especially in this environment,” said Morningstar analyst Rodney Nelson, who noted some companies in the sector have sold for high multiples. Oracle and NetSuite both offer software applications that help companies automate back end and administrative operations from technology to human resources. NetSuite’s chief executive, Zach Nelson, was responsible for Oracle’s global marketing from 1996 to 1998. Oracle’s cloud business, which stores enterprise software and data on remote servers, lets the company sell to clients who lack the budget for on-site hardware and technology staff.  Like rivals SAP SE (SAPG.DE), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Oracle has focused on moving its business toward the cloud-computing model as sales of traditional software licenses struggle. The deal also could help Oracle, which is aggressively trying to build and sell more cloud-based business software, play catch up with competitors such as Workday Inc WDAY.N and Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) that specialize in cloud-based offerings. NetSuite on Thursday reported strong second-quarter results, with revenue up 30 percent on the year and adjusted net income that beat estimates. Jefferies analysts said in a note the deal provides an immediate, significant entry into the mid-market for corporate applications but that “the price paid seems steep.” Oracle also has acquired companies such as Textura and Opower to increase its competitiveness in the cloud market. Morningstar’s Nelson said NetSuite would be Oracle’s largest purchase since PeopleSoft more than a decade ago. The company expects the deal to add to its adjusted earnings in the first full fiscal year after it closes. Oracle said the evaluation and negotiation of the deal was led by a committee of independent directors. Closing is conditional on investors tendering a majority of the NetSuite shares not owned by executive officers, directors or people affiliated with Ellison and his family. Analysts said this structure was used to address the governance issue and increase the likelihood of its approval. “A regulatory review and shareholder lawsuits are likely given the family’s ownership stake. However, we don’t view these as material risks to the transaction going through,” BTIG analyst Joel Fishbein wrote in a note to clients. Paul Hodgson, an independent governance consultant, said a factor in the governance debate is whether Oracle overpaid. “If it did, then that is a conflict of interest. If it paid what the market considers a fair price, then it’s fine,” he said. Because Ellison’s ownership is all the public domain, the issue in unlikely to be a holdup for the transaction, said Peter Bible, chief risk officer at EisnerAmper Accountants and Advisors.

397,ORCL,Fitch: Acquisition of NetSuite Does Not Affect Oracle's 'A+/F1' Ratings,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings believes the acquisition of NetSuite,  Inc. (NetSuite) does not affect the ratings for Oracle Corp. (Oracle), including  the 'A+' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and 'F1' Short-Term IDR. The  Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of current ratings follows at the end of  this release. Fitch believes the acquisition of NetSuite strengthens Oracle's cloud-based  enterprise resource planning (ERP) offerings and, as a result, the company's  hybrid-cloud environment solutions for enterprise customers. For NetSuite, the  acquisition by Oracle bolsters investment in engineering and distribution, given  Oracle's significantly greater scale and distribution platform. The $9.3 billion  price tag is significant, given NetSuite's relatively small size and only modest  impact on Fitch's expectations for Oracle's operating results and financial  profile. Revenue for the trailing 12 months (TTM) ended March 31, 2016 was $793 million,  although Fitch expects NetSuite's top line will continue growing near 20%  through the intermediate term, driven by strong product offerings and increasing  customer penetration. Fitch estimates TTM operating EBITDA of $72 million,  although we expect deferred revenue within the context of NetSuite's high  recurring-revenue model should also continue growing by double digits and added  $111 million to cash flow for the TTM. NetSuite's operating EBITDA margin is in  the high single digits, although Fitch anticipates some standalone margin  expansion from top line-driven absorption. While the transaction fits Oracle's strategy to build its as-a-Service (aaS)  capabilities, the NetSuite deal's size exceeds Fitch's previous expectations for  annual acquisitions and roughly equal's Fitch's free cash flow (FCF) forecast.  Oracle has yet to announce proposed funding for the acquisition but Fitch  believes Oracle will have sufficient available cash and domestic FCF, although  this may reduce amounts available for share repurchases for at least the near  term.  The NetSuite deal also may require debt-financing incremental acquisitions, some  of which may not provide sufficient profitability to reduce elevated leverage  metrics within 12-18 months. Fitch continues to expect supplemental adjusted net  leverage (SANL) at or below 1.5x through the forecast period and that negative  rating actions could occur if Fitch expects Oracle to sustain SANL above 2x.  Oracle announced it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Netsuite, a  cloud-based ERP provider, for $9.3 billion in cash, or $109 per share. Oracle  expects the transaction will close in 2016, subject to customary conditions,  including regulatory approvals and NetSuite's stockholders tendering a majority  of NetSuite's outstanding shares in the tender offer. In addition, closing is  subject to a majority of NetSuite's outstanding shares not owned by NetSuite  officers or directors, or affiliates of Larry Ellison being tendered in the  offer. Fitch currently rates Oracle: --Long-Term IDR at 'A+'; --Revolving Credit Facility at 'A+'; --Senior Unsecured Debt at 'A+'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F1'; --CP at 'F1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

398,ORCL,NetSuite shareholder T. Rowe Price opposes sale to Oracle,"(Reuters) - Investment manager T. Rowe Price Group Inc expressed opposition to Oracle Corp’s proposed acquisition of U.S. cloud computing company NetSuite Inc, saying the $9.3 billion deal price is too low. In a letter NetSuite made public on Wednesday, T. Rowe told the company’s board that it would not tender its shares. This could put pressure on Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison to consider making a new offer to combine his software company with NetSuite, in which he holds a 40 percent stake. A majority of NetSuite shareholders not affiliated with Ellison must tender their shares for the deal to happen. As the company’s largest shareholder after Ellison with an 18 percent stake, T. Rowe could significantly influence the outcome.  Large mutual fund managers rarely make their views public. Most prefer to pressure corporate executives in private meetings or to sell shares of companies whose strategies they question, although T. Rowe has been the occasional exception.  Chris Davis, a partner in law firm Kleinberg Kaplan who focuses on M&A; and activism, welcomed T. Rowe’s letter, because it gives companies “clear guidelines for the future about what they will have to do to satisfy their most sophisticated institutional shareholders.” T. Rowe, NetSuite and Oracle declined to comment. Oracle said in July that it would buy NetSuite for $109 per share in cash to increase its ability to help its corporate customers automate administrative operations. NetSuite stock was trading just above that price at $109.30 on Wednesday, indicating some investors expected a new deal.  T. Rowe said it was disappointed NetSuite did not reach out to other potential buyers before agreeing on a price with Oracle. “At $109 per share, our preference is for NetSuite to remain independent,” T. Rowe said.   It added that potential bidders would probably avoid NetSuite because of its “unique relationship” with Ellison. “In our view, the inherent conflicts of interest between NetSuite, the Ellison entities and Oracle are daunting and may be impossible to manage,” T. Rowe said. T. Rowe, however, said it appreciated some conditions NetSuite put into place, such as the minimum acceptance threshold in the tender offer. NetSuite also formed a special committee of independent board members to consider the deal. In 2013, T. Rowe opposed Michael Dell’s deal to take his eponymous computer maker private. Shareholders can take legal action if they believe a deal undervalues their company, provided they do not tender their shares. Dell had to pay tens of millions of dollars to shareholders following such a lawsuit.

This could put pressure on Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison to consider making a new offer to combine his software company with NetSuite, in which he holds a 40 percent stake. A majority of NetSuite shareholders not affiliated with Ellison must tender their shares for the deal to happen. As the company’s largest shareholder after Ellison with an 18 percent stake, T. Rowe could significantly influence the outcome.  Large mutual fund managers rarely make their views public. Most prefer to pressure corporate executives in private meetings or to sell shares of companies whose strategies they question, although T. Rowe has been the occasional exception.  Chris Davis, a partner in law firm Kleinberg Kaplan who focuses on M&A; and activism, welcomed T. Rowe’s letter, because it gives companies “clear guidelines for the future about what they will have to do to satisfy their most sophisticated institutional shareholders.” T. Rowe, NetSuite and Oracle declined to comment. Oracle said in July that it would buy NetSuite for $109 per share in cash to increase its ability to help its corporate customers automate administrative operations. NetSuite stock was trading just above that price at $109.30 on Wednesday, indicating some investors expected a new deal.  T. Rowe said it was disappointed NetSuite did not reach out to other potential buyers before agreeing on a price with Oracle. “At $109 per share, our preference is for NetSuite to remain independent,” T. Rowe said.   It added that potential bidders would probably avoid NetSuite because of its “unique relationship” with Ellison. “In our view, the inherent conflicts of interest between NetSuite, the Ellison entities and Oracle are daunting and may be impossible to manage,” T. Rowe said. T. Rowe, however, said it appreciated some conditions NetSuite put into place, such as the minimum acceptance threshold in the tender offer. NetSuite also formed a special committee of independent board members to consider the deal. In 2013, T. Rowe opposed Michael Dell’s deal to take his eponymous computer maker private. Shareholders can take legal action if they believe a deal undervalues their company, provided they do not tender their shares. Dell had to pay tens of millions of dollars to shareholders following such a lawsuit.

Rowe Price Group  will vote against Oracle Corp’s proposed takeover of NetSuite Inc and said it preferred NetSuite to remain independent. Oracle said in July it would buy NetSuite in an about $9.3 billion deal that would give the company a larger share in the rapidly growing cloud computing business. Oracle Executive Chairman Larry Ellison beneficially owns about 40 percent of NetSuite’s shares as of February, according to a regulatory filing. “In our view, the inherent conflicts of interest between NetSuite, the Ellison entities and Oracle are daunting and may be impossible to manage,” T. Rowe Price wrote in a letter to NetSuite’s board. T. Rowe Price, NetSuite's second-largest-shareholder, said on Wednesday it owns about 14.5 million shares, or 18 percent, of the company.

403,ORCL,Oracle's profit forecast misses estimates; shares slip,"(Reuters) - Oracle Corp forecast lower-than-expected quarterly profit as growth in its cloud-based business fails to make up for weakness in its traditional software offerings. The company’s shares fell nearly 2.7 percent in extended trading on Thursday. Like rivals SAP SE, Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp, Oracle is making an aggressive shift to the cloud as customers increasingly shun the costlier licensing model. The company in July agreed to buy NetSuite Inc for $9.3 billion to better compete with nimbler rivals such as Workday Inc and Salesforce.com Inc that specialize in cloud-based offerings. Total cloud revenue rose 59 percent to $969 million in the first quarter ended Aug. 31. However, the company’s traditional software business, which offers higher margins, continued to suffer. Sales of new software licenses fell 10.5 percent to $1.03 billion. For the second quarter, the company said it expected adjusted earnings of 59 cents to 62 cents per share and revenue growth of up to 3 percent. The company had reported revenue of about $9 billion for the same period a year earlier. Analysts were expecting adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share and revenue of $9.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said its latest quarter was also weighed down by a strong dollar, which reduced revenue from various businesses by 1 to 3 percent.      Effects of currency movements in the quarter were more than the company’s expectations due to the surprise Brexit vote in June, co-Chief Executive Safra Catz said on a conference call. Total revenue edged up 1.7 percent to $8.6 billion. However, it rose 3 percent on a constant currency basis. Oracle’s net income rose to $1.83 billion, or 43 cents per share, from $1.75 billion, or 40 cents per share. Excluding items, Oracle earned 55 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $8.7 billion and a profit of 58 cents per share. Oracle’s shares closed at $40.86 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. Up to Thursday’s close, the stock had risen nearly 12 percent this year. ",9152016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oracle-results/oracles-profit-forecast-misses-estimates-shares-slip-idUSKCN11L2N5

Oracle said in a statement that holders of 53 percent of unaffiliated NetSuite shares agreed to tender their shares by a Friday deadline. The deal will be completed on Monday, Oracle said.

416,ORCL,Oracle's revenue growth falls short of analysts' expectations,"(Reuters) - Business software maker Oracle Corp’s (ORCL.N) adjusted revenue missed analysts’ estimates for the seventh time in the last eight quarters, showing that its shift to cloud-based offerings is taking longer than Wall Street expected. Oracle, which gets little more than half of its revenue from outside the United States, said revenue in the latest second quarter was hurt by the dollar’s gains, especially since the U.S. election, and an unforeseen Egyptian currency exchange loss. The company’s shares were down 2.4 percent in extended trading on Wednesday, despite an upbeat revenue forecast for the current quarter. As its core business of selling software licenses continues to shrink, Oracle has been beefing up its cloud business, most recently though the $9.3 billion acquisition of NetSuite, to take on nimbler rivals such as Workday Inc WDAY.N and Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N). Revenue from Oracle’s cloud software- and platform-as-a-service surged 81 percent to $878 million, slightly less than expected. Its total cloud business revenue jumped 62 percent to top $1 billion in quarterly sales for the first time. “Oracle has now passed salesforce.com and become number one in SaaS cloud applications sales to customers with over 1,000 employees,” Oracle CEO Mark Hurd said in a statement, citing market research firm IDC. Still, Oracles’ cloud revenue was about one-ninth of total revenue. Its higher-margin traditional software business continued to suffer, with revenue falling a bigger-than-expected 19.7 percent to $1.35 billion in the quarter. Hardware revenue fell 10 percent to about $1 billion. The Redwood City, California-based company’s total adjusted revenue inched up 0.8 percent to $9.07 billion. On a constant currency basis revenue growth would have been 2 percent. Its profit fell 8 percent to $2.03 billion. Excluding items, it earned 61 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $9.12 billion and a profit of 60 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Oracle said its adjusted profit per share would have been 2 cents higher if it were not for the strong dollar and the Egyptian currency exchange loss. The company forecast current-quarter adjusted earnings of 61-64 cents per share and revenue growth of between 3-5 percent, compared with analysts’ estimates of a profit of 64 cents and revenue growth of 2.6 percent. “As we get bigger in the cloud, we grow faster in the cloud,” said CEO Safra Catz, who will join U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team.

418,ORCL,Tech drags Wall Street lower; China tension weighs,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Friday, weighed by a more than 4 percent drop in Oracle shares, while recently battered stocks in the real estate and utilities sectors posted the largest gains.  Oracle dropped 4.3 percent to $39.10 after its adjusted revenue missed analysts’ estimates. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P; and the tech sector. Analysts said that investors were anxious and turned to defensive sectors in stocks as well as U.S. Treasuries after a report that a Chinese Navy warship seized a U.S. underwater drone on Thursday in international waters in the South China Sea. The news about the drone seizure “turned it to a risk-off day,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. “At a minimum the headline hits you. It’s not often you have two world powers getting this frontal.” The Dow Jones industrial average fell 8.83 points, or 0.04 percent, to 19,843.41, the S&P; 500 lost 3.96 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,258.07 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 19.69 points, or 0.36 percent, to 5,437.16. The Dow rose for its sixth consecutive week but the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq posted slight weekly declines. Utilities and real estate were the best-performing sectors on the S&P;, in a rotation out of recent winning sectors. U.S. stocks have been on a tear since the Nov. 8 presidential election, with the S&P; rising 5.5 percent on bets that President-elect Donald Trump’s expected deregulation and infrastructure spending will boost the economy. However, there are some concerns that the rally may have little support as policy will take time to be implemented and likely will change as it makes its way through Congress. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.18-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P; 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 172 new highs and 41 new lows. About 10.84 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, well up from the 7.53 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

429,ORCL,Delrahim to be nominated to head U.S. Justice Department's Antitrust Division,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A member of President Donald Trump’s transition team, Makan Delrahim, will be nominated to head the U.S. Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, the White House said on Monday. Delrahim is expected to move to the Justice Department after finishing up in the White House counsel’s office, where he has worked to steer Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch through the Senate confirmation process. The Senate must vote to confirm Delrahim once the nomination is formalized.   As the proposed chief of the Antitrust Division, Delrahim would review corporate mergers at a time when many investors and corporate executives are anticipating a more relaxed view of deal-making after years of tough oversight by the administration of former President Barack Obama.       Antitrust experts who have followed Delrahim’s career have said that when it comes to merger approvals he would follow in the footsteps of a former boss, Hewitt Pate, who was assistant attorney general of antitrust from 2003 to 2005. Delrahim was Pate’s deputy, specializing in international antitrust. Under Pate, the division was criticized for allowing too many deals, but it sued to stop US Airways from merging with United Airlines and blocked a deal to combine DirecTV and EchoStar. It tried but failed to stop Oracle Corp from buying PeopleSoft. “I know Makan Delrahim to be smart, energetic and expert in antitrust. He is certainly no pushover,” said Seth Bloom, a former general counsel of the Senate antitrust subcommittee who knew Delrahim when both worked on Capitol Hill.     Reuters first exclusively reported on March 17 that Delrahim was expected to be nominated to head the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. If confirmed, Delrahim would oversee the Justice Department’s assessment of AT&T;’s Inc plan to buy Time Warner Inc, the owner of HBO, Warner Brothers and news network CNN.

430,ORCL,UPDATE 2-Delrahim to be nominated to head U.S. Justice Dept's Antitrust Division,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A member of President Donald Trump’s transition team, Makan Delrahim, will be nominated to head the U.S. Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, the White House said on Monday. Delrahim is expected to move to the Justice Department after finishing up in the White House counsel’s office, where he has worked to steer Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch through the Senate confirmation process. The Senate must vote to confirm Delrahim once the nomination is formalized.   As the proposed chief of the Antitrust Division, Delrahim would review corporate mergers at a time when many investors and corporate executives are anticipating a more relaxed view of deal-making after years of tough oversight by the administration of former President Barack Obama.       Antitrust experts who have followed Delrahim’s career have said that when it comes to merger approvals he would follow in the footsteps of a former boss, Hewitt Pate, who was assistant attorney general of antitrust from 2003 to 2005. Delrahim was Pate’s deputy, specializing in international antitrust. Under Pate, the division was criticized for allowing too many deals, but it sued to stop US Airways from merging with United Airlines and blocked a deal to combine DirecTV and EchoStar. It tried but failed to stop Oracle Corp from buying PeopleSoft. “I know Makan Delrahim to be smart, energetic and expert in antitrust. He is certainly no pushover,” said Seth Bloom, a former general counsel of the Senate antitrust subcommittee who knew Delrahim when both worked on Capitol Hill.     Reuters first exclusively reported on March 17 that Delrahim was expected to be nominated to head the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. If confirmed, Delrahim would oversee the Justice Department’s assessment of AT&T;’s Inc plan to buy Time Warner Inc, the owner of HBO, Warner Brothers and news network CNN.

434,ORCL,Trump U.S. antitrust nominee says will be independent of White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Makan Delrahim, who was chosen by President Donald Trump to be the top U.S. antitrust regulator, said on Wednesday that he would maintain independence from the White House in enforcing antitrust law. The Senate must still vote to confirm Delrahim. In a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee overshadowed by repercussions over Trump’s firing of Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, Delrahim reiterated that he would recuse himself from a fight over whether health insurer Anthem may merge with rival Cigna. Delrahim had worked for Anthem as a lobbyist when he was with the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP. Obama’s Justice Department sued to stop the deal, and the case is currently under appeal. Asked what he would do if the White House wanted to discuss a deal being considered by the division, Delrahim said antitrust enforcement was law enforcement. “The independence of the decisions made in prosecuting and reviewing mergers as well as other conduct is a serious one that should be free from any political influence,” he said. “They will be free if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed.” Delrahim currently works in the White House as deputy assistant and deputy counsel to the president. If confirmed as expected, Delrahim’s antitrust division would review corporate mergers at a time when many investors and corporate executives are anticipating a more relaxed view of deal-making.

437,ORCL,RPT-Former Oracle board member dogged by links to China-backed chip deal,"(Repeats to additional customers with no changes to text) By Liana B. Baker and Michael Flaherty SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - As the ultimate corporate insiders, board members are presented with plenty of opportunities to cash in on their sector knowledge and connections. The case of Ray Bingham, until recently Oracle Corp’s second-highest paid board member and executive chairman at U.S. chip maker Cypress Semiconductor Corp, shows how taking advantage of those breaks can backfire. The 71-year old technology veteran helped set up a private equity fund backed by China’s central government last fall. In November, the fund agreed to buy Lattice Semiconductor Corp , another U.S. chip manufacturer, for $1.3 billion – a potentially lucrative coup for Bingham. But the chip deal is in doubt over U.S. national security concerns. On Monday, Lattice and the buyout fund, Canyon Bridge Capital Partners, said they submitted the deal for review for the third time to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The deal has also cost Bingham personally. His connection to Canyon Bridge has forced Bingham, recipient of a 2009 Financial Times ‘Outstanding Director’ accolade, to relinquish two marquee board seats in the technology sector because of divergent perceptions of whether he faced conflicts of interest in his various roles. On Sunday, Bingham resigned from Cypress’ board of directors after the company’s founder and sixth-largest shareholder - T.J. Rodgers - sued the Cypress board and launched a proxy contest to remove Bingham from the board. Rodgers alleged Bingham faced irreconcilable conflicts of interest because of his involvement with Canyon Bridge. Bingham, in the Cypress announcement of his stepping down, cited this contest as a distraction. It came three months after he gave up his seat on Oracle’s board of directors due to controversy over him moonlighting for Canyon Bridge. “Throughout the process (of joining Canyon Bridge), Ray conducted himself with transparency. He discussed his plans to join Canyon Bridge with Cypress’ board and outside legal counsel, who concluded there was no conflict and was given the green light to join,” a Canyon Bridge spokesman told Reuters. Bingham himself did not respond to several requests for comment. Bingham’s reputation in the technology industry helped clinch the Lattice acquisition for Canyon Bridge, regulatory filings show. Bingham was offered a $1.2 million signing bonus by Canyon Bridge, a $2 million cut of its management fees and a 20 percent stake in Canyon Bridge itself. That is in addition to the $890,902 in 2016 he received from Oracle, making him the second-highest paid board director at the company behind founder Larry Ellison, and an annual salary and bonus from Cypress worth $900,000, as well as equity grants worth $4.5 million. The income from Oracle and Cypress is now gone because of his gamble to align with Canyon Bridge. Bingham continues to serve on the board of two other publicly listed technology companies, Flex Ltd and TriNet Group Inc. U.S. board members increasingly come from business leadership backgrounds. This often presents them with new opportunities that come up through existing roles or previous corporate relationships. This was the case with Bingham, who had done business with China-born U.S. citizen, Benjamin Chow, when Bingham worked at private equity firm General Atlantic LLC a decade ago. Chow set up Canyon Bridge last summer with funding from China Reform Management, a Chinese state-owned investment firm, which became Canyon Bridge’s sole investor, according to Lattice’s regulatory filings. For a timeline of events in the Lattice deal, click Chow approached Bingham last August. He believed that a U.S.-based buyout fund with a U.S. partner like Bingham would trigger much less scrutiny by CFIUS compared with a Chinese buyer, Reuters reported in March. Canyon Bridge’s Chinese state links, first revealed by Reuters in November, were a bone of contention at Oracle. Its board told Bingham in March he could not retain his seat and continue to be a partner of Canyon Bridge, according to Bingham’s deposition in Rodgers’ lawsuit. In response, Bingham decided to step down. “Oracle expressed concern that Bingham’s affiliation with Canyon Bridge would compromise Oracle’s relationship with the United States government,” Andre Bouchard, the judge presiding over Rodgers’ lawsuit, said at Delaware’s Court of Chancery earlier this month, citing Bingham’s deposition. Oracle declined to comment. Chow, approached through Canyon Bridge, declined to comment. Bingham helped Chow set up Canyon Bridge in September and October 2016, taking on tasks ranging from setting up calls for hiring staff for Canyon Bridge to using Bingham’s name, a quote from him, and his phone number at Cypress on the press release announcing the Lattice deal on November 3, according to regulatory and court filings. Bingham was even given signatory authority on a $30 million Canyon Bridge bank account. Yet he had not yet formally joined Canyon Bridge, and had not let Cypress’ board know. On Oct. 20, Bingham contacted Cypress’ outside counsel, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, to ask if he should tell Cypress’ board he was considering joining Canyon Bridge, according to a regulatory filing from Cypress. Bingham concluded there was no need to do so at that time, according to Cypress. Wilson Sonsini did not respond to a request for comment. “Clearly this is a matter that would have been of interest to the other board members, and the fact that Bingham did not come forth with this information prior to that time seems odd,” said Alan Seem, a corporate partner at law firm Shearman & Sterling LLP who is not involved with the case. On Nov. 4, at a regularly scheduled Cypress board meeting and a day after the Lattice deal was announced with his name on the press release, Bingham told the board that he was contemplating joining Canyon Bridge as a minority partner, according to Cypress. At the same meeting, Morgan Stanley gave a presentation to Cypress’ board in which it identified Canyon Bridge as one of the top four most likely acquirers for Cypress out of a list of 30 company names. Cypress itself had been approached by Lattice twice in 2016 about making a potential acquisition offer, most recently last September, but it turned both opportunities down, according to Cypress. Nonetheless, Cypress said its board concluded there was no conflict of interest because there were no active talks or considerations about a possible deal with either Lattice or Canyon Bridge. But some Cypress board members could see that there was scope for future problems.  On Nov. 7, Eric Benhamou, Cypress’ lead independent director at the time, told another director that Bingham’s role with Canyon Bridge was “ripe for conflicts interest,” according to a Cypress regulatory filing. In December, Cypress’ board amended the company’s code of ethics to ensure that if Cypress was having significant acquisition talks with a potential target, then any conflicted director would recuse themselves. “Duty of loyalty issues are corrosive. They leave investors with the impression that the playing field isn’t level,” said Thomas Lys, accounting information and management professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.

They leave investors with the impression that the playing field isn’t level,” said Thomas Lys, accounting information and management professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.

442,ORCL,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Oracle beats profit estimates on cloud push, shares jump","(Corrects paragraph 5 to say deal with AT&T; happened in “May”, not in “April”) June 21 (Reuters) - Oracle Corp’s quarterly profit blew past analysts’ estimates as the business software maker’s big push towards cloud-based products and services paid off. The company’s shares were up 5 percent at $48.74 in after-market trading on Wednesday. Oracle said cloud-computing and on-premise software business revenue rose 5.3 percent to $8.88 billion in the fourth quarter ended May 31. The business accounted for 78 percent of total revenue in 2016. The company has been shifting to a cloud-based service as customers increasingly shun the costlier licensing model, a pattern also adopted by rivals such as Microsoft Corp, SAP SE and Amazon.com Inc. In an effort to strengthen its cloud business, Oracle signed a deal with AT&T; Inc in May, under which the U.S. telecom company agreed to move some of its large-scale databases to Oracle’s cloud platform. The company had said it expected more of its “big customers” to migrate their databases and database applications to Oracle Cloud in the coming year. NetSuite, which Oracle acquired in 2016, is also expanding its data center footprint to take on nimbler rivals such as Workday Inc and Salesforce.com Inc. The company’s net income rose to $3.23 billion, or 76 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended May 31, from $2.81 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Oracle earned 89 cents per share. The company reported an adjusted revenue of $10.94 billion. Analysts on average had estimated a profit of 78 cents per share and a revenue of $10.45 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Up to Wednesday’s close, Oracle’s shares had risen about 20 percent this year.

444,ORCL,Oracle bank on gut reaction in America's Cup,"HAMILTON, Bermuda (Reuters) - Sailors usually have cast iron stomachs, but in the quest to retain the America’s Cup, Oracle Team USA are leaving nothing to chance.  They are using advances in gut testing to boost health and fitness as they gear up to battle back against New Zealand and win the oldest trophy in international sport. Improving their internal health has improved the number of days the team can sail and train and cut illness rates as they ramp up training in a bid to cut a 3-0 New Zealand lead.  Oracle’s gains could also have implications for other sports, businesses and general health and wellbeing as the focus shifts to preventative medicine. A chance meeting in Bermuda between Dr Erika Angle, CEO and co-founder of Ixcela, a biotechnology firm which has developed microbiome tests, and Scott Tindal, Oracle’s head physio and team nutritionist, started the U.S. team’s foray into stomach health. The gut balances of Oracle’s 13 sailors were tested using Ixcela’s kit. Their diet was modified based on the results and they also took tailored supplements and probiotics. “We saw a significantly large improvement in performance. This is the front end of the wave,” Angle said.   Oracle experienced a 30 percent reduction in the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections, a 47.5 percent gain in the number of sailing days lost to illness and a 54 percent improvement in the number of training days lost. “It’s only going to get better with different tests for professional sports and individuals,” Tindal said. One sailor who suffered from 17 upper respiratory tract infections had that number cut to one and another had 12 similar illnesses reduced to three. “This doesn’t stop you from getting sick, but it does reduce the incidence and severity. You do get sick, but you bounce back quicker, that’s powerful and significant in a sporting context,” Tindal said.  The introduction of 50-foot catamarans that “fly” on hydrofoils into the America’s Cup has increased the physical demands on sailors who are operating at 90 percent plus heart rates during the races as they grind winches by hand or cycle on bikes to move massive wing sails. “We’ve not seen these levels of fitness in sailing before,” Tindal said.  Oracle is putting in punishingly long days on the water ahead of the resumption of racing on Saturday, leaving the sailors shaking before team coaches helped them rebalance their energy.  This compares to 20-minute races that burn around 500 calories per sailor.

450,ORCL,UPDATE 2-Cloud services lift SAP sales but costs tether profit growth,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Newer cloud services powered a rise in second-quarter revenue at Germany’s SAP but higher costs curbed profit growth, results from Europe’s most valuable technology firm showed on Thursday. Core profits excluding special items rose 3 percent to 1.57 billion euros at constant currency rates, shy of the 1.59 billion expected by analysts. Revenue of 5.78 billion euros ($6.65 billion) was up 10.4 percent and topped the 5.71 billion expected by analysts polled by Reuters.  Classic software license and support business revenue rose 4 percent to 3.83 billion euros, which brokerage Baader noted outpaced a 4 percent fall at rival Oracle Corp.  Cloud subscriptions and support revenue rose 27 percent to 932 million euros in constant currencies, below the 33 percent analysts, on average, had expected. SAP Chief Executive Bill McDermott said some cloud deals which the company had expected to sign in second quarter had been delayed.  “The cloud story is completely intact,” McDermott told reporters. “The pipeline for (the third quarter) and beyond is fantastic.” The world’s biggest maker of business planning software used by multinationals said research and development costs rose 19 percent, while sales and marketing costs were up 16 percent fueled by higher spending on its push into cloud services. Year-ago figures benefited from prior restructuring benefits, SAP executives said. Including special items under IFRS accounting standards, operating profit fell 27 percent, weighed down by restructuring and stock option costs. The company has reorganized its customer services organization to focus more on its cloud businesses. SAP shares which hit all-time highs in June dipped 0.4 percent in early trade in Frankfurt. SAP expects to meet or slightly beat its 2017 financial targets, it said. Those forecasts exclude the impact of currency swings, where a recent rise in the euro has slightly dented its international results. “We expect continuing momentum in the second half and confidently raise our guidance for the full year,” CEO McDermott said in a statement.   SAP raised its sales forecast by 100 million euros for the full year, to a range of 23.3 billion to 23.7 billion euros. Its operating profit target was unchanged at around 6.8 billion to 7.0 billion euros. Analysts expect a profit of 7.1 billion euros on revenue of 23.9 billion, a Reuters poll showed.  SAP, along with rival Oracle, must boost internet-based sales to head off pure cloud competitors Salesforce.com, Workday and Amazon.com’s web services unit, whose sales are all growing two or more times faster.     SAP also announced a planned 500 million euro share buyback to start shortly and to be carried out through the year. The stepped up repurchases reflect strong first half free cashflow.

454,ORCL,"Oracle backs online human trafficking bill, breaking with tech industry","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cloud services company Oracle Corp on Wednesday backed a bipartisan proposal in the U.S. Congress that would make it easier to penalize operators of websites that facilitate online sex trafficking. The endorsement of legislation advancing in the U.S. Senate marks a sharp departure for Oracle from most of the technology industry, which vigorously opposes the bill on grounds it would thwart digital innovation and lead to endless litigation. “Your legislation does not, as suggested by the bill’s opponents, usher the end of the internet,” Kenneth Glueck, Oracle senior vice president, wrote in a letter to Republican Senator Rob Portman and Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal,  chief architects of the proposal. “If enacted, it will establish some measure of accountability for those that cynically sell advertising but are unprepared to help curtail sex trafficking,” Glueck said. The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, introduced by Portman last month, would amend a section of a decades-old law that has generally shielded companies such as Facebook,, Amazon and Alphabet’s Google from liability for content shared by their users. It would allow state attorneys general and victims of sex trafficking to pursue legal action against social media networks, advertisers and others that are found to be insufficiently limiting exploitative material on their platforms. The U.S. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has said suspected child sex trafficking has surged in recent years in part because of internet platforms that allow traffickers to advertise. Technology companies have long opposed any changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which they have heralded as among the most important federal protections guarding innovation in Silicon Valley. Oracle primarily works in the cloud services space, meaning unlike Google and other major tech firms it does not serve as an intermediary platform where users share content. Portman has said his bill is sufficiently narrow in scope. In a statement, he cheered Oracle’s support as acknowledging that the legislation is the “right prescription for fixing a fundamental flaw in the law that has enabled online sex traffickers to escape justice.” The bill has more than a quarter of support from the Senate, and similar legislation in the House of Representatives has accrued more than 100 co-sponsors. Still, it faces an uphill battle to pass a gridlocked Congress, which has sent no major legislation to President Donald Trump this year.

456,ORCL,"Oracle's profit, cloud growth forecasts drag down shares","(Reuters) - Oracle Corp forecast current-quarter adjusted profit largely below Wall Street’s estimates and indicated to slowing growth in its soaring cloud business, sending the company’s shares down as much as 5 percent in aftermarket trading. Shares of the business software maker, which reported market-beating revenue and profit for the first quarter on Thursday, initially rose but reversed course after the forecast. They had gained about 37 percent this year.  Oracle said it expected adjusted profit to be between 64 cents per share and 68 cents per share for its second quarter ending November. Analysts on average were expecting 68 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Oracle - a late entrant to the cloud market - has been aggressively pushing into the business as more and more clients ditch the costlier software licensing model. The company, however, is facing strong competition from other big cloud players such as Amazon.com Inc, Salesforce.com Inc  and Microsoft Corp. Oracle forecast total cloud revenue to increase 39 percent to 43 percent in the second quarter, lower than the 51.4 percent growth it reported in the latest quarter.  “It is natural to expect cloud revenue to decelerate as Oracle grows its cloud revenue off (a) bigger base,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Steve Koenig.   Still, Oracle expects cloud bookings to grow. “I expect Q2 cloud booking growth to be strong or stronger than our Q1 growth rate,” co-CEO Mark Hurd said on a post-earnings call.      Oracle said in late August it would hire more than 5,000 engineers, consultants, sales and support people this year to boost the fast-growing business. Earlier this month, the company linked the equity package of its two CEOs, Mark Hurd and Safra Catz, and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison to performance targets that include $20 billion in total cloud revenue in a fiscal year. The company reported revenue of about $4.57 billion for the business in its financial year that ended on May 31. Total cloud business revenue rose to $1.47 billion in the three months ended Aug. 31, while it increased to $5.92 billion in the company’s traditional software licensing business. Total adjusted revenue rose about 7 percent to $9.21 billion, handily beating expectations of $9.03 billion.  On an adjusted basis, Oracle earned 62 cents per share, beating estimates by 2 cents. Koenig said the beat was helped by new software license outperformance and lower foreign exchange impact.

463,ORCL,Slack locks down Oracle partnership targeting enterprises,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Slack Technologies Inc has secured a partnership with Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) to integrate the tech giant’s enterprise software products into the popular workplace messaging app, the two companies told Reuters. The partnership is a victory for Slack as the young startup ramps up its efforts to win the business of large enterprises in an increasingly competitive marketplace that has seen the entry of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and countless startups. “As you see all these large enterprise software companies looking at messaging as a major platform, they’re looking to partner with us first and foremost,” said Brad Armstrong, Slack’s head of global business and corporate development. The partnership will allow workers to use Slack as the interface for Oracle’s sales, human resources and business software.  Workers will be able to ask questions such as “how many vacation days do I have left this year?” and instantaneously receive a response from an Oracle chatbot, said Suhas Uliyar, Oracle vice president of bots, artificial intelligence and mobile. “I call this the next browser,” Uliyar said. “This is just the natural way in how you converse.” Slack entered the partnership to differentiate its messaging product among large corporations, a market the company has made a top priority since launching an enterprise-grade version of its messenger in January.  Slack is hoping the Oracle partnership will entice more corporations to choose its messenger over Microsoft Teams, Facebook Workplace and Atlassian Stride, all of which launched in the past year.  Oracle, meanwhile, said the partnership is key to serving younger professionals, many of which are accustomed to using messaging interfaces like Slack, Snapchat and Facebook Messenger. “We need to make sure we’re embracing the way the world is changing and embracing the way that people are working,” Uliyar said. The partnership between the two companies came about after Slack secured the tech giant as a customer. At Oracle, there are 30,000 workers who actively use Slack for work. Oracle is currently developing these chatbots, and they will begin to roll out to Slack and Oracle users within the next two quarters, Uliyar said.

Workers will be able to ask questions such as “how many vacation days do I have left this year?” and instantaneously receive a response from an Oracle chatbot, said Suhas Uliyar, Oracle vice president of bots, artificial intelligence and mobile. “I call this the next browser,” Uliyar said. “This is just the natural way in how you converse.” Slack entered the partnership to differentiate its messaging product among large corporations, a market the company has made a top priority since launching an enterprise-grade version of its messenger in January.  Slack is hoping the Oracle partnership will entice more corporations to choose its messenger over Microsoft Teams, Facebook Workplace and Atlassian Stride, all of which launched in the past year.  Oracle, meanwhile, said the partnership is key to serving younger professionals, many of which are accustomed to using messaging interfaces like Slack, Snapchat and Facebook Messenger. “We need to make sure we’re embracing the way the world is changing and embracing the way that people are working,” Uliyar said. The partnership between the two companies came about after Slack secured the tech giant as a customer. At Oracle, there are 30,000 workers who actively use Slack for work. Oracle is currently developing these chatbots, and they will begin to roll out to Slack and Oracle users within the next two quarters, Uliyar said.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration made a number of changes to tighten up the H-1B program, widely used by tech companies, including the suspension of an expedited approval process for those visas. Immigration “is an amazing opportunity for us to attract talent and grow our economy,” Hurd said, noting his company hires about 20,000 workers each year on average. Hurd made his remarks came when asked by a Reuters reporter how the Trump Administration’s immigration policies have affected Oracle’s hiring practices. “I usually defer these sort of questions, but I’m going to go with this one.

472,ORCL,Amazon sells off China cloud assets as tough new rules bite,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is selling off the hardware from its public cloud business in China, amid tightening regulation over online data that is creating a hurdle for technology firms operating in the world’s second-largest economy. Beijing Sinnet Technology Co Ltd, Amazon’s China partner, said in a filing late on Monday that it would buy the U.S. firm’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud computing unit in China for up to 2 billion yuan ($301.2 million). “In order to comply with Chinese law, AWS sold certain physical infrastructure assets to Sinnet,” an AWS spokesman said on Tuesday, adding AWS would still own the intellectual property for its services worldwide. “‎We’re excited about the significant business we have in China and its growth potential.” Chinese regulators are tightening rules on foreign data and cloud services, implementing new surveillance measures and increasing scrutiny of cross-border data transfers. Laws that came into effect in June require firms to store data locally. “This move is mostly around regulatory compliance,” said Charlie Dai, Beijing-based analyst at Forrester Research. He added the move was necessary for AWS to build up its other business areas in the market. AWS has a separate hardware venture in partnership with the Ningxia provincial government in China’s northwest. Amazon said on its website that its public cloud services in the country are exclusively managed by Sinnet. Amazon’s cloud business in China already faced tougher rules due to China’s tight internet controls. In August, Sinnet told customers it would shut down VPNs and other services on its networks that allow users to circumvent China’s so-called Great Firewall system of censorship, citing direct instructions from the government. The move casts a shadow over similar foreign ventures in the country. Microsoft Corp, Oracle Corp and IBM Corp are also facing tough new regulatory challenges in localizing their data storage units.  Global firms in China, including Apple Inc, have this year transferred data to Chinese ventures overseen by local authorities. Microsoft operates its Azure cloud services unit in partnership with China-based 21Vianet Group. “We expect other foreign players, such as Oracle and IBM, will also ensure regulatory compliance as long as they want to provide public cloud services in China,” said Dai. Microsoft, Oracle and IBM did not immediately respond to request for comment on Tuesday.  Cloud services have become a crowded and competitive field in China in recent years, with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s cloud unit opening over a dozen overseas data centers since 2016.

474,ORCL,Oracle backs tougher foreign investment bills aimed at China,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Software maker Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) is backing bipartisan legislation that aims to toughen foreign investment rules amid increasing concern over Chinese efforts to buy U.S. high-tech companies, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Wednesday. The bills, which were introduced last week, would expand the power of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), allowing it to review smaller investments and add new national security factors, such as exposure of Americans’ Social Security numbers, for CFIUS to consider. CFIUS, an inter-agency panel, reviews proposed transactions for national security concerns. CFIUS can recommend that a transaction be prohibited, but only the president can issue an order to stop or suspend a deal. In a letter addressed to three senators who introduced the legislation, Oracle Senior Vice President Kenneth Glueck welcomed the identical bills in the Senate and House of Representatives. “We appreciate the language is narrowly tailored to focus on specific national security concerns, distinguishing between investments that are financially motivated and investments that are strategically motivated, such as improving foreign military capabilities or other strategic objectives,” Glueck wrote in the letter to Republican Senators John Cornyn and Richard Burr and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein. The House bill was introduced by Republican Representative Robert Pittenger, also with bipartisan co-sponsors.

479,ORCL,Oracle shares tumble as cloud outlook darkens,"(Reuters) - Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) on Thursday forecast current-quarter cloud revenue growth that missed Street expectations after reporting disappointing second-quarter sales in the same business, sending its shares down nearly 7 percent after hours. The company has seen its shares rise nearly 30 percent this year as investors bet that its efforts to switch to the cloud would pay off. Oracle said growth in its cloud-computing business would slow to 21 percent to 25 percent in the third quarter, down from the 44 percent growth in the preceding quarter. The forecast was also below analysts’ estimates. The company’s current-quarter profit expectations also came in below analysts’ estimates. Oracle, which inked cloud deals with AT&T; (T.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N) this year, is a late entrant to the cloud-based business and has been stepping up efforts to catch up with rivals such as Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Salesforce.com (CRM.N). “Oracle has largely made the transition on SaaS but still have a lot of work ahead on transitioning the database business to the cloud,” said Wedbush analyst Steve Koenig. In October, the company launched its machine learning-based autonomous database cloud to better compete against market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS). “Investors were expecting more...Microsoft and Amazon are in a two-horse race that is well above any other competitor and everyone else is chasing them, including Oracle,” said Daniel Ives of research firm GBH Insights.  Amazon posted a 42 percent rise in cloud sales to $4.58 billion in the quarter to September, while revenue in Microsoft’s Azure services surged 90 percent during the same period. Oracle forecast current-quarter adjusted profit between 68 cents and 70 cents per share, compared with analysts’ expectations of 72 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

482,ORCL,Oracle Corp to buy Australia's Aconex for $1.19 billion,"Sydney (Reuters) - Australia’s Aconex Ltd ACX.AX said on Monday it had received a A$1.56 billion ($1.2 billion), or A$7.80 in cash-per-share, buyout offer from U.S. software major Oracle Corp (ORCL.N), sending the target’s share price up 45 percent. Aconex said in a statement its directors unanimously recommended the offer, with shareholders of the cloud-based project management company scheduled to vote on the bid at a scheme meeting in March next year. The Australian company specializes in web-based project management software that allows input from different teams. Its technology has been used on global projects including the Panama Canal extension. “Oracle’s offer of A$7.80 per share represents a significant premium and a high degree of certainty of value to shareholders through the cash offer and limited conditionality,” Aconex Chairman Adam Lewis said in a statement.   Aconex founders Leigh Jasper and Rob Phillpot, who both have holdings of just over 5 percent, declined interview requests on Monday. The company has experienced massive share price fluctuations since listing in 2014 at A$1.90, and peaking at just above A$8.50 last year. The share price rose 45 percent immediately after trading resumed on Monday to just below the A$7.80 cash-per-share offer. Aconex, which focuses on construction projects, said it would be liable to pay Oracle about 1 percent of the deal’s equity value as a break-up fee under certain conditions which it did not specify.  Oracle said in a statement that the transaction was expected to close in the first half of 2018. The proposed transaction was one of two major U.S.-Australian technology deals unveiled on Monday, with Australian data centre provider Metronode receiving a A$1.04 billion ($791.2 million) bid from U.S. company Equinix Inc(EQIX.O).

484,ORCL,Australia shares rise on US tax reform hope; NZ shares slip,"Dec 18 (Reuters) - Australian shares were on course to snap a two-day losing streak on Monday, making broad-based gains on firmer commodity prices and optimism around U.S. tax reform. Top U.S. Republicans said on Sunday they expected Congress to pass a tax code overhaul this week, with a Senate vote as early as Tuesday and President Donald Trump aiming to sign the bill by week’s end. “I think the market is being encouraged by stronger U.S. markets based on the U.S. tax cuts, number one, secondly, by a boost in commodities and material stocks this morning,” said Ric Spooner, Chief market strategist at CMC Markets. The S&P;/ASX 200 index was up 0.6 percent, or 38.6 points, to 6,035.6 by 0051 GMT. The benchmark slipped 0.2 percent on Friday. Mining heavyweight BHP Billiton’s shares rose as much as 1.9 percent to their highest in more than a month tracking strong copper and coal prices. Copper prices scaled three-week highs on Friday after the New York open and as expectations of strong demand in top consumer China were reinforced by data showing firm industrial activity. “It is a very big move in recent days and certainly we could go a bit further but I don’t think we are going to see new highs for the year,” added CMC Markets’ Spooner.

485,ORCL,UPDATE 2-Oracle Corp to buy Australia's Aconex for $1.19 bln,"Sydney (Reuters) - Australia’s Aconex Ltd ACX.AX said on Monday it had received a A$1.56 billion ($1.2 billion), or A$7.80 in cash-per-share, buyout offer from U.S. software major Oracle Corp (ORCL.N), sending the target’s share price up 45 percent. Aconex said in a statement its directors unanimously recommended the offer, with shareholders of the cloud-based project management company scheduled to vote on the bid at a scheme meeting in March next year. The Australian company specializes in web-based project management software that allows input from different teams. Its technology has been used on global projects including the Panama Canal extension. “Oracle’s offer of A$7.80 per share represents a significant premium and a high degree of certainty of value to shareholders through the cash offer and limited conditionality,” Aconex Chairman Adam Lewis said in a statement.   Aconex founders Leigh Jasper and Rob Phillpot, who both have holdings of just over 5 percent, declined interview requests on Monday. The company has experienced massive share price fluctuations since listing in 2014 at A$1.90, and peaking at just above A$8.50 last year. The share price rose 45 percent immediately after trading resumed on Monday to just below the A$7.80 cash-per-share offer. Aconex, which focuses on construction projects, said it would be liable to pay Oracle about 1 percent of the deal’s equity value as a break-up fee under certain conditions which it did not specify.  Oracle said in a statement that the transaction was expected to close in the first half of 2018. The proposed transaction was one of two major U.S.-Australian technology deals unveiled on Monday, with Australian data centre provider Metronode receiving a A$1.04 billion ($791.2 million) bid from U.S. company Equinix Inc(EQIX.O).

498,ORCL,Oracle revenue misses as cloud growth falls short of estimates,"(Reuters) - Business software maker Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) reported quarterly revenue on Monday that missed analysts’ estimates as sales from its cloud business fell short of Wall Street expectations, sending its shares down nearly 6.3 percent after market. Cloud business revenue rose 31.7 percent to $1.57 billion, but fell short of the average analysts’ estimate of $1.59 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A late entrant into the rapidly growing cloud-based software business, Oracle has aggressively stepped up efforts to play catch up with rivals such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N). Last year Oracle launched its autonomous database cloud to compete with Amazon Web Services (AWS). “The challenge for ORCL is with its database business, namely getting its database customers to choose Oracle Cloud instead of deploying their Oracle licenses on AWS, Azure, or Google,” Steve Koenig, analyst at Wedbush Securities said.  Revenue from Oracle’s traditional software licensing business, its largest, rose nearly 4 percent to $6.42 billion. Oracle forecast current-quarter adjusted profit between 92 cents and 95 cents per share above estimates of 90 cents. The Redwood City, California-based company reported a net loss of $4.02 billion, or 98 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Feb. 28, compared to a profit of $2.24 billion, or 53 cents per share, a year earlier. Oracle recorded a charge of $6.9 billion in the reported quarter, due to the recently enacted U.S tax law. Excluding items, the company earned 83 cents per share. Total revenue rose 6.1 percent to $9.77 billion. Analysts were expecting a profit of 72 cents per share on revenue of $9.78 billion.

504,ORCL,Appeals court revives Oracle's copyright claim against Google,"(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday resurrected a multi-billion dollar copyright case brought by Oracle Corp against Alphabet Inc’s Google. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said Google’s use of Oracle’s Java development platform to create the Android operating system was not protected under the fair-use provision of copyright law, reversing a 2016 jury verdict. The court sent the case back to a U.S. judge in San Francisco for a trial to determine how much compensation Google owes Oracle. Oracle had previously sought $9 billion in damages. “We are disappointed the court reversed the jury finding that Java is open and free for everyone,” Google spokesman Patrick Lenihan said in a statement. “This type of ruling will make apps and online services more expensive for users.” “The Federal Circuit’s opinion upholds fundamental principles of copyright law and makes clear that Google violated the law,” said Oracle general counsel Dorian Daley in a statement. “This decision protects creators and consumers from the unlawful abuse of their rights.” The closely watched case, which dates to 2010, involves how much copyright protection should extend to the Java programming language, which Google used to design the Android operating system that runs most of the world’s smartphones. Oracle is seeking royalties for Google’s use of some of the Java language, while Google argues it should be able to use Java without paying a fee. Annemarie Bridy, a professor of intellectual property at the University of Idaho College of Law, said in an interview the ruling could stifle software innovation by opening up developers to potential liability for copyright infringement. “This is a ruling that could have a significant chilling effect on software developers,” she said, noting that they rely on computer code like Oracle’s to make apps communicate with each other. Matthew Sarboraria, a vice president and associate general counsel at Oracle, said in an interview that such concerns were overblown. Sarboraria said the ruling bolsters copyright protection in the software industry, ensuring that programmers have incentives to innovate. “The sky is not falling,” he said. “The sky is firmly in place.” ",3272018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-oracle/appeals-court-revives-oracles-copyright-claim-against-google-idUSKBN1H321R

Catz told reporters in Tel Aviv that the company’s cloud business was impacted by a new model made available to customers three quarters ago that resulted in much higher than projected licence growth. “That makes the appearance of a lower number (for the cloud business) even though money is actually coming into another bucket,” Catz said. “As this evens out I think we are going to start seeing cloud acceleration again that is very significant but I don’t want to time that right now.” California-based Oracle last month said its quarterly cloud business revenue rose 31.7 percent to $1.57 billion, but fell short of the average analysts’ estimate of $1.59 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

U.S. media have reported that the Pentagon is set to award a multi-billion dollar cloud computing contract to Amazon. “I cannot think of a single commercial enterprise that has only one cloud, it just makes no sense. The way we see it the Microsoft workloads should go to the Microsoft cloud, the Amazon-type workloads ... should go to Amazon, the Oracle should go to the Oracle cloud.” Catz said Trump was very confident the Pentagon would have a fair review, adding, “I’m sure that they will”. Earlier this month, Trump said he would take a serious look at policies to address what he says are the unfair business advantages of online retailer Amazon. (Reporting by Tova Cohen.

Intel Corp CEO Brian Krzanich and the chief technical officers of Ford Motor Co and Boeing Co are due to take part, along with executives from Mastercard Inc, Microsoft Corp and Accenture, the White House said on Tuesday. The Pentagon and the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Health and Human Services, Labor and Transportation are due to take part in the daylong event that will look at artificial intelligence (AI) innovation and research and development and removing barriers to its application. “AI is quickly transforming every segment of American industry - from applications in precision agriculture and medical diagnostics to advanced manufacturing and autonomous transportation,” the White House said. Other companies taking part include IBM Corp, Bank of America Corp, General Electric Co, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Monsanto Co, Pfizer Inc, Walmart Inc, Whirlpool Corp, CVS Health Corp and United Airlines. Facebook Vice President of AI Jerome Pesenti, Google senior research scientist Greg Corrado and the presidents of California Institute of Technology and Carnegie Mellon University also are set to participate. Dean Garfield, president and chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, called the event “an important step to building collaboration between government and industry.” “The tech sector is committed to ensuring that all Americans reap the benefits of this transformative technology, which has the potential to save lives, improve how we harvest food, transform education and more,” Garfield said.
