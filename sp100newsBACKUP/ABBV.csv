1,ABBV,Abbott results bode well for spun-off AbbVie,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N), the new branded pharmaceuticals company spun off by Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N), is off to a good start, judging by fourth-quarter sales of arthritis drug Humira and other products in its medicine chest. The picture, although healthy, could be more challenging for the remaining Abbott, nicknamed “new Abbott,” which continues to sell medical devices, diagnostics, nutritional products and generic drugs, said analysts. The new Abbott said it expects earnings for 2013, excluding special items, of $1.98 to $2.04 per share, in line with its earlier guidance and above the average Wall Street forecast of $1.95. Although the company has not yet provided complete earnings data for full-year 2012, it said the mid-point of its 2013 profit forecast would likely represent double-digit earnings growth. But Abbott is still analyzing its numbers because of the split and may eventually restate some figures, analysts said. A big worry, according to Leerink Swann analyst Danielle Antalffy, is whether Abbott can revive sales of its branded generic medicines, which the company calls established pharmaceuticals. Sales of the products slipped 4 percent in 2012 to $5.1 billion. Abbott predicted they would capture mid-single-digit growth this year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates. “The business, which represents 25 percent of company sales, has been underperforming,” Antalffy said, adding that revenue forecasts for the business are difficult because they rely on data from so many local markets and countries. Fourth-quarter sales of all products that remain with Abbott were $5.7 billion, roughly in line with analysts’ forecasts. Although the company did not provide comparable sales figures for the fourth quarter of 2011, Antalffy estimated sales rose 4 to 5 percent in the most recent quarter. Analysts said trends for AbbVie, based on more-detailed data for its products provided by Abbott on Wednesday, were easier to interpret. Global sales of branded drugs that now belong to AbbVie rose 7.4 percent to $5.14 billion in the fourth quarter, topping the $4.8 billion estimate of Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen. The rise would have been 8.5 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the value of sales in overseas markets. Sales of Humira, by far AbbVie’s biggest product, jumped 23 percent to $2.68 billion, about $200 million above Biegelsen’s estimate. That represented a marked acceleration of sales growth from the prior two quarters and underscores how reliant AbbVie is on the injectable product, which is expected to become the world’s top-selling medicine this year. AbbVie, spun off by Abbott earlier this month, is expected to report its interpretation of the fourth-quarter results and its 2013 forecast on January 30. Among top product lines still sold by Abbott, sales of nutritional brands jumped 10.2 percent to $1.71 billion in the fourth quarter, and sales of laboratory diagnostics grew 3.8 percent to $908 million. Sales of diabetes care products rose 3.1 percent to $362 million, reversing a 10 percent decline seen in the prior quarter. Abbott shares closed down 0.3 percent, while AbbVie shares climbed 3.8 percent, both on the New York Stock Exchange.

4,ABBV,UPDATE 4-AbbVie forecasts slower Humira growth,"* 2013 EPS forecast, excluding items, $3.03 to $3.13 per share * Street’s earnings-per-share forecast: $3.08 * AbbVie shares fall 0.8 pct By Ransdell Pierson Jan 30 (Reuters) - AbbVie, the pharmaceuticals business spun off earlier this month by Abbott Laboratories , forecast 2013 earnings in line with Wall Street forecasts but slowing sales growth for Humira, its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug. The company on Wednesday said it expects low double-digit sales growth for Humira this year. Sales of the drug, by far the company’s biggest product, jumped 17 percent last year to $9.27 billion. “Their Humira growth forecast is a little less than people expected, but our view is that it’s a conservative estimate,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. Conover said he expects Humira’s sales to climb 17 percent in 2013, matching the growth seen in 2012. He noted that Abbott had been known for issuing its own conservative Humira forecasts, with actual growth typically outpacing projections. Industry analysts, during a conference call with AbbVie executives, expressed concern that Humira’s track record of strong growth could become a “curse” once it slows down. AbbVie Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez replied that Humira should have “robust” growth for the foreseeable future. One of the biggest concerns among investors is that a new oral treatment for rheumatoid arthritis from Pfizer Inc  called Xeljanz could slow the growth of Humira, which is given by injection. Gonzalez said AbbVie has been tracking sales of Xeljanz since it was approved in November, and is not overly concerned about its potential threat. “We don’t see any trends there that are troublesome,” Gonzalez said. AbbVie said it expects full-year 2013 earnings of $3.03 to $3.13 per share, excluding special items. Analysts, on average expected $3.08 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. AbbVie said it expects net earnings this year of $2.66 to $2.76 per share. It forecast 2013 sales somewhat above $18 billion, similar to sales for its products last year, as generic competition hits demand for its drugs to control cholesterol. The company said it is counting on approvals of new medicines that could drive company growth by the second half of 2015. Abbott last week said global fourth-quarter sales of branded drugs that now belong to AbbVie rose 7.4 percent to $5.14 billion. That topped estimates of some industry analysts, including Wells Fargo’s Larry Biegelsen, who had expected $4.8 billion. The rise would have been 8.5 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the value of sales in overseas markets. Quarterly sales of Humira jumped 23 percent to $2.68 billion, about $200 million above some analyst forecasts. The growth was a marked acceleration from the prior two quarters and underscores how reliant AbbVie is on Humira, which is expected this year to become the world’s top-selling medicine. The company’s second-biggest product is AndroGel, a testosterone gel to treat conditions that result from a lack of the male hormone. It had fourth-quarter sales of $373 million. AbbVie said it plans to steadily increase dividends, but expects no major share-repurchase initiatives in the short or long term. Company executives also said they are not on the hunt for big acquisitions, but are interested in smaller “tuck in” deals. Abbott, nicknamed “new Abbott,” continues to sell medical devices, diagnostics, nutritional products and generic drugs. It and AbbVie are both located in suburban Chicago. AbbVie’s shares fell 31 cents to $37 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.",1302013,http://www.reuters.com/article/abbvie-results/update-4-abbvie-forecasts-slower-humira-growth-idUSL1N0AZ2ZU20130130

10,ABBV,UPDATE 1-AbbVie hepatitis C drugs knock out virus at 8 weeks,"* 96 pct cured with AbbVie 12-week treatment regimen * AbbVie shares up 2 percent * Bristol-Myers shares up 1.2 percent after promising data By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot April 23 (Reuters) - AbbVie Inc’s experimental hepatitis C treatment cured up to 96 percent of patients in just 12 weeks, according to data released on Tuesday, shoring up its position in the race to deliver a potent oral therapy for the serious liver disease. AbbVie’s treatment, a combination of five oral medications,  is expected to be a close contender to a treatment in development by Gilead Sciences Inc. Analysts see the Gilead drug winning regulatory approval as early as 2014, with AbbVie close behind. AbbVie said on Tuesday that about 88 percent of new patients with hepatitis C were deemed cured after only eight weeks of treatment, while 96 percent of those treated for 12 weeks eliminated the liver virus, as verified by blood tests 24 weeks after completion of treatment. No serious safety concerns were observed by researchers. If the virus is undetectable 24 weeks after completing treatment - known as sustained virologic response, or SVR 24 - a patient is considered cured. The latest findings from an ongoing trial sponsored by AbbVie, called Aviator, were unveiled at a meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in Amsterdam. Shares of AbbVie rose 2 percent in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. “AbbVie looked good, but I think Gilead is still in the lead,” said Tim Nelson, an analyst with Nuveen Asset Management. He estimates that the market for oral hepatitis C treatments would be worth billions of dollars in annual sales. Hepatitis C affects an estimated 170 million people worldwide, and if left untreated can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer or the need for a new liver. Existing treatments must be taken by patients for either 24 or 48 weeks and the most effective have a cure rate as high as 80 percent. Several companies are working to eliminate infusions of difficult-to-tolerate interferon from the regimen, while raising cure rates and shortening the length of treatment. The latest results from AbbVie confirmed interim data presented in October, which showed a 99 percent SVR rate for patients evaluated 12 weeks after completing a 12-week regimen of the treatment. “We are pleased that the data remain consistent and robust,” lead researcher Dr. Kris Kowdley in said an interview. “The data confirm that the 12-week treatment appears to be optimal, but certainly we are still very pleased with ... data for the eight-week treatment.” AbbVie spokeswoman Tracy Sorrentino said the 8-week data was impressive. But for larger late-stage trials, she said the company plans to test the drug combination for 12 weeks, in order “to help the greatest number of patients achieve virologic cure.” Gilead has been given an edge by many analysts because its experimental regimen involves fewer drugs and may be closer to reaching the market. AbbVie said it is testing regimens with fewer drugs and ones that do not include the older oral drug ribavirin, which can also be difficult for some patients to tolerate. Bristol-Myers Squibb unveiled data on Tuesday at the meeting from a smaller mid-stage study of its three-drug combination that does not include ribavirin. Its program is behind those of Gilead and AbbVie, but cure rates in excess of 90 percent and a relatively clean safety profile are expected to make it a formidable player in the field. Bristol-Myers shares were up 1.2 percent. Patients in the AbbVie Aviator study had the most common, but hardest to treat, genotype 1 variation of the infectious virus. The AbbVie regimen included three experimental direct acting antiviral drugs that each attack a different target necessary for virus replication. The drugs were the protease inhibitor ABT-450, whose effect was boosted by a widely used antiviral called ritonavir; the polymerase inhibitor ABT-333, and ABT-267 from a class known as NS5A inhibitors. Those were given along with the older medicine ribavirin. Kowdley, director of the Liver Center of Excellence at Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle, said the trial also showed impressive results among patients who had failed to benefit from earlier therapy. The cure rate after 12 weeks of treatment was 93 percent for those patients, called null responders, assessed both 12 weeks and 24 weeks after completion of their drug regimens. In addition, data showed a cure rate of 95 percent for patients treated for 24 weeks, and then assessed 24 weeks after treatment stopped. AbbVie said the safety of the tested drugs was similar to that seen in results presented last year. Of the 247 patients evaluated, serious side effects were seen in four patients (1.6 percent), while seven patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes that can be considered a potential sign of toxicity. Less-serious side effects seen in more than 10 percent of patients included headache, fatigue, nausea, insomnia and diarrhea.",4232013,http://www.reuters.com/article/abbvie-hepatitis/update-1-abbvie-hepatitis-c-drugs-knock-out-virus-at-8-weeks-idUSL2N0DA10Y20130423
11,ABBV,AbbVie hepatitis C drugs knock out virus at eight weeks,"(Reuters) - A combination of five oral drugs being tested by AbbVie Inc cured at least 88 percent of new patients with hepatitis C after only eight weeks of treatment, without raising significant safety issues, researchers said on Tuesday. The latest findings from an ongoing trial sponsored by AbbVie, called Aviator, also showed that 96 percent of patients taking the five medicines for 12 weeks eliminated the virus, as assessed by blood tests 24 weeks after they stopped treatment. If the virus is undetectable 24 weeks after completing treatment, known as SVR 24, a patient is considered cured. The latest results were deemed little different than the 99 percent sustained virologic response (SVR) rate reported in October, for patients evaluated 12 weeks after completing 12 weeks of the five-drug treatment regimen. “We are pleased that the data remain consistent and robust,” said Dr. Kris Kowdley, who is presenting the data this week at a meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in Amsterdam. “The data confirm that the 12-week treatment appears to be optimal, but certainly we are still very pleased with ... data for the eight-week treatment,” Kowdley said in an interview. AbbVie is deemed to be in a horse race with Gilead Sciences Inc to be first to market with an all-oral treatment for the serious liver disease, as companies work to eliminate difficult-to-tolerate intravenous interferon from the regimen, while raising cure rates and shortening treatment duration. Current hepatitis C treatments take either 24 or 48 weeks. Hepatitis C affects an estimated 170 million people worldwide, and if left untreated can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer or the need for a new liver. Gilead has been given an edge by many analysts because its experimental regimen involves fewer drugs.

13,ABBV,AbbVie delivers on strong growth of Humira arthritis drug,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc’s (ABBV.N) quarterly profit rose 10 percent on surging sales of its Humira treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, and the company said it plans to launch several potentially lucrative new treatments for hepatitis C by early 2015. Shares of AbbVie, the pharmaceuticals business spun off by Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) early this year, rose 2.7 percent in midday trading, amid little change for the drug sector. Sales of Humira, which accounts for more than half of AbbVie sales, jumped 16 percent in the quarter to $2.24 billion and outpaced the company’s earlier predictions of low double-digit growth for the medicine for the full year. “Humira is off to a strong start this year, well on track to achieve our sales growth outlook,” company Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez told analysts in a conference call on Friday. AbbVie plans to lessen its dependence on Humira by developing big-selling drugs for other diseases, including a number of oral treatments for hepatitis C that Gonzalez said will likely be approved by early 2015. Three experimental AbbVie drugs, which are used in combination with each other, have proven able to eliminate the dangerous liver virus in more than 90 percent of patients. That is well above cure rates for current hepatitis C drugs which cause harsher side effects and are used for far longer periods. AbbVie is racing against Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N), which are also testing potential blockbuster oral therapies for hepatitis C that dispense with interferon, an injectable drug used with current therapies that causes flu-like symptoms. Gonzalez said about 175,000 patients a year were treated for hepatitis C in 2011. But he estimated the number could swell to 350,000 per year, with demand for simpler treatments for the disease which can cause cirrhosis and liver cancer and create the need for a liver transplant. “There will be motivation to go treat those patients,” Gonzalez said. AbbVie’s hepatitis C drugs could pull in annual sales of $3 billion, said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. AbbVie said it earned $968 million, or 60 cents per share, in the first quarter. That compared with $883 million, or 56 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, AbbVie earned 68 cents per share. Analysts, on average, were expecting 67 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. AbbVie said global quarterly sales rose 3.7 percent to $4.33 billion, which was in line with the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales would have risen 5.1 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which hurts the value of sales in overseas markets. Humira’s 16 percent sales growth in the quarter was typical of its performance in recent years. Many investors have fretted that newer treatments for rheumatoid arthritis could slow down growth of AbbVie’s injectable drug, including a pill from Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) called Xeljanz that was approved in the United States last November. Humira’s continued growth prospects got a possible boost late on Thursday when European regulators declined to approve Xeljanz. They cited risk of side effects and questioned how well the pill slowed down structural damage to joints. Gonzalez, who in January shrugged off the Xeljanz threat as not “worrisome,” on Friday said the European Union’s rejection for Pfizer’s drug will have no near-term impact on Humira. Besides rheumatoid arthritis, the AbbVie drug also garners big sales for treatment of psoriasis and Crohn’s disease — which, like rheumatoid arthritis, are linked to inflammation. Pfizer vowed late Thursday to challenge the decision by the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Morningstar’s Conover predicted Xeljanz will eventually be approved in Europe, but not for at least another few years. “Any delay will meaningfully help Humira over the next few years,” Conover said. European regulators appear to have “raised the bar” for approving drugs for rheumatoid arthritis, Conover said, wanting greater assurance they slow down progression of the disease, and not merely treat pain, swelling and other symptoms. Gonzalez said Humira continues to have robust sales growth in Europe in large part because it is deemed able to put disease into remission “and able to hold it in remission for long periods of time.” ",4262013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-abbvie-results/abbvie-delivers-on-strong-growth-of-humira-arthritis-drug-idUSBRE93P12520130426

Besides rheumatoid arthritis, the AbbVie drug also garners big sales for treatment of psoriasis and Crohn’s disease — which, like rheumatoid arthritis, are linked to inflammation. Pfizer vowed late Thursday to challenge the decision by the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Morningstar’s Conover predicted Xeljanz will eventually be approved in Europe, but not for at least another few years. “Any delay will meaningfully help Humira over the next few years,” Conover said. European regulators appear to have “raised the bar” for approving drugs for rheumatoid arthritis, Conover said, wanting greater assurance they slow down progression of the disease, and not merely treat pain, swelling and other symptoms. Gonzalez said Humira continues to have robust sales growth in Europe in large part because it is deemed able to put disease into remission “and able to hold it in remission for long periods of time.”",4262013,http://www.reuters.com/article/abbvie-results/update-3-abbvie-delivers-on-strong-growth-of-humira-arthritis-drug-idUSL2N0DD1H320130426
15,ABBV,AbbVie delivers on scorching Humira drug sales growth,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) reported slightly better than expected quarterly results on Friday, fueled by surging sales of its Humira treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Sales of Humira, which accounts for more than half of AbbVie sales, jumped 16 percent in the quarter to $2.24 billion and outpaced the company’s earlier predictions of low double-digit growth for the medicine for the full year. AbbVie, the pharmaceuticals business spun off by Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) at the beginning of the year, said it earned $968 million, or 60 cents per share, in the first quarter. That compared with $883 million, or 56 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, AbbVie earned 68 cents per share. Analysts, on average, were expecting 67 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. AbbVie said global quarterly sales rose 3.7 percent to $4.33 billion, which was in line with the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales would have risen 5.1 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which hurts the value of sales in overseas markets. Humira’s sales growth in the quarter, typical of its performance in recent years, underscored AbbVie’s reliance on the product, which is expected this year to become the world’s top-selling prescription drug. Many investors have fretted that newer treatments for rheumatoid arthritis could slow down growth of AbbVie’s injectable drug, including a pill from Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) called Xeljanz that was approved in the United States last November. AbbVie Chief Executive Officer Richard Gonzalez in January shrugged off the Xeljanz threat, telling investors that sales trends for the Pfizer drug were not “worrisome.” Humira’s continued growth prospects got a boost late on Thursday when European regulators declined to approve Xeljanz. They cited risk of side effects such as infections, gastrointestinal perforations and malignancies, and questioned how well the pill slowed down structural damage to joints. Pfizer vowed late Thursday to challenge the decision by the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Morningstar analyst Damien Conover predicted Xeljanz will eventually be approved in Europe, but not for at least another few years. “Any delay will meaningfully help Humira over the next few years,” Conover said.

23,ABBV,UPDATE 2-Fast-growing Humira extends domination of AbbVie,"By Ransdell Pierson July 26 (Reuters) - AbbVie Inc’s reliance on its Humira arthritis drug became even more evident during the second quarter, when the product’s sales jumped 12 percent and accounted for almost 56 percent of the U.S. drugmaker’s revenue. And AbbVie officials on Friday forecast more big growth for the world’s best-selling medicine. “Humira is off to a strong start in the first half of the year, and as a result we now expect global Humira sales growth of 14 to 15 percent” for the full year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Chief Executive Rick Gonzalez told analysts on a conference call. He said sales of the drug, approved for rheumatoid arthritis as well as psoriasis, Crohn’s disease and other conditions, will grow largely because of expected approval for new uses and its adoption in more countries. The bullish sales forecast comes in spite of new competition for Humira, including a recently approved pill from Pfizer Inc  called Xeljanz. AbbVie, reporting second-quarter results on Friday, said Humira sales vaulted to $2.61 billion in the period, putting it on track to become a $10 billion-a-year cash cow. Sales of the drug rose 16 percent in the first quarter, accounting for 51.7 percent of AbbVie’s total sales. The company plans to lessen its reliance on Humira by developing lucrative drugs for other diseases, including oral treatments for hepatitis C that could be approved by early 2015, and a promising treatment called ABT-199 for various blood cancers. Three experimental AbbVie drugs, used in combination, have proven able to eliminate the potentially dangerous hepatitis C liver virus in more than 90 percent of patients. That is well above cure rates for current hepatitis C drugs, which cause harsher side effects and are used for far longer periods. AbbVie is racing against Gilead Sciences Inc and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co to develop oral therapies for hepatitis C that dispense with interferon, an injectable drug used with current therapies that causes flu-like symptoms. “It’s a tight race, (but) we’re feeling very, very good about our position,” Scott Brun, AbbVie’s head of drug development, said during the Friday conference call. In the meantime, all eyes remain on Humira, which has posted strong growth, quarter after quarter, since it was approved in 2002. Some investors have nicknamed AbbVie “Humira Inc.” “We see AbbVie as essentially a Humira story until the company is able to further diversify its business,” JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note. Rheumatoid arthritis, the biggest use for Humira, is an autoimmune disorder in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. It affects an estimated 1.5 million Americans. Many analysts expect Humira sales to climb long after its U.S. patent lapses in late 2016 because it will likely take rivals years to win approval for “biosimilar” forms of the drug. AbbVie and its array of patent-protected prescription drugs were spun out early this year from Abbott Laboratories. AbbVie reported better-than-expected second-quarter results due to Humira’s showing and sales growth of its Creon digestive enzymes drug, Synagis to prevent lung disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus, and Duodopa for Parkinson’s disease. But sales of TriCor and Trilipix, drugs used to lower blood fats called triglycerides, plunged 66 percent to $107 million due to competition from cheaper generics. The company earned $1.07 billion, or 66 cents per share, in the quarter. Excluding special items, profit was 82 cents per share, 3 cents above the average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales totaled $4.69 billion, topping Wall Street expectations of $4.54 billion. AbbVie raised the low end of its full-year profit forecast. It now expects earnings, excluding special items, of $3.07 to $3.13 per share. In April it forecast $3.03 to $3.13. The company said that in the year-ago second quarter, based on sales of the same products it sells now, it earned $1.27 billion, or 80 cents per share. On the same basis, sales in the latest quarter were up 4.4 percent from a year earlier. AbbVie shares were up 1.5 percent to $44.91 near midday on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have jumped 29 percent since the company went public at the beginning of the year, compared with an overall 18 percent advance for the drug sector. JPMorgan’s Schott maintained his “neutral” rating on AbbVie, saying it could take several years for its new drugs to arrive.",7262013,http://www.reuters.com/article/abbvie-results/update-2-fast-growing-humira-extends-domination-of-abbvie-idUSL1N0FW0DC20130726
24,ABBV,Ablynx signs drug deal worth up to $840 million with AbbVie,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgian biotech firm Ablynx (ABLX.BR) has signed a licensing agreement with U.S. drugmaker AbbVie (ABBV.N) worth up to $840 million for an experimental drug against rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Under the terms of the deal, Ablynx will receive an upfront payment of $175 million and may receive additional payments of up to $665 million, depending on the success of its product ALX-0061, which is currently in mid-stage clinical trials. Ablynx will also be eligible to receive royalties on net sales, assuming the drug makes it to the market. The group’s shares jumped as much as 13.7 percent on Monday on the announcement, reaching their highest level in more than two years. “This should attract the next level of investors and we anticipate the stock to stabilise at new highs,” KBC analyst Jan De Kerpel wrote in a note to clients. CEO Edwin Moses said the global licence agreement with AbbVie represented “a major milestone for Ablynx”. Ablynx produces so-called nanobody medicines derived from llama antibodies that are around one-tenth the size of normal antibodies, which means they may be better able to reach disease targets in the body. In February, Ablynx said a Phase IIa clinical study of ALX-0061 showed promising results and the drug was well tolerated by the 37 rheumatoid arthritis patients who took the drug over the course of 24 weeks. Ablynx will be responsible for completing Phase II clinical development of the drug. The Belgian company will retain an option for co-promotion rights on ALX-0061 in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

26,ABBV,AbbVie beats forecast as Humira sales surge,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) on Friday reported stronger-than-expected results for the third quarter, as booming sales of its Humira arthritis treatment and Synthroid thyroid replacement drug more than offset lower demand for other medicines. Shares of the drugmaker, which was split off at the beginning of the year from Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N), rose 2.4 percent. Humira, a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn’s disease and other conditions, is the world’s top-selling prescription drug. Sales have risen steadily since it was introduced in 2002. The injectable drug’s global sales soared 19.1 percent to $2.77 billion in the quarter, outpacing 16 percent growth in the prior quarter. Humira accounted for almost 60 percent of total sales, illustrating AbbVie’s growing reliance on a product that will lose U.S. patent protection in late 2016. Many analysts, however, expect sales of Humira to keep growing after its patent expires because it may take many years for generic drugmakers to develop and win approvals for complex “biosimilar” forms of the biotech drug. In the meantime, AbbVie is hoping to develop and market lucrative new drugs, including oral treatments for hepatitis C that could be approved by early 2015 and a promising treatment called ABT-199 for various blood cancers. “The AbbVie story is good as long as Humira grows, and it’s growing above expectations,” said Barclays analyst Tony Butler, who said the quarterly sales topped his forecast by $100 million. Humira sales were helped by a 15 percent price increase in the United States over the past year, he added. Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger predicted Humira’s annual sales will jump another 30 percent, to $13 billion, by 2016. “It should have peak sales similar to Lipitor,” Risinger said, referring to Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) cholesterol fighter, which had been the world’s top-selling drug until it lost patent protection in late 2011. AbbVie said it had earned $964 million, or 60 cents per share, in the third quarter, compared with $1.59 billion, or $1.01 per share, a year earlier. Excluding write-downs of intangible assets and other special charges, profit was 82 cents per share. That was 4 cents above the analysts’ average estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company, based in suburban Chicago, raised the low end of its 2013 earnings forecast to $3.11 per share from $3.07, while keeping the high end at $3.13. Sales rose 3.3 percent to $4.66 billion, beating Wall Street expectations of $4.52 billion. Synthroid sales jumped 23 percent to $161 million, while sales of Creon, a digestive enzymes drug, rose almost 10 percent to $101 million. But sales of TriCor and Trilipix, drugs used to lower blood fats called triglycerides, fell 88 percent to $39 million due to competition from cheaper generics.

29,ABBV,AbbVie's hepatitis C treatment helps 96 pct of patients in trial,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc said a late-stage trial of its experimental oral hepatitis C treatment showed about 96 percent of patients had no detectable levels of the virus after 12 weeks. AbbVie shares rose 3 percent. Shares of Enanta Pharmaceuticals Inc, which collaborates with AbbVie on one of the drugs included in the treatment, rose 4 percent. The trial is being watched closely because of the potential of the treatment, 3D regimen, to eliminate the need for the injectable drug interferon, which can have debilitating side effects. Analysts said the “high efficacy” seen in the trial was in line with market expectations but underlined the increasingly competitive landscape. “Thus far AbbVie looks competitive but still key data to come,” UBS analyst Marc Goodman wrote in a note. AbbVie, the pharmaceuticals business spun off by Abbott Laboratories early this year, said it was on track for regulatory submissions for the treatment in the second quarter of 2014. “We conservatively forecast AbbVie’s HCV regimen to produce $192 million in 2015, and reach peak sales of $950 million in 2018,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei wrote in a note. Gilead Sciences Inc’s experimental hepatitis C drug sofosbuvir is awaiting a decision from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co also has advanced all-oral clinical trial programs in late-stage development. But Gilead is widely seen to be leading the race. AbbVie’s trial, named Sapphire-I, is the first of six late-stage trials testing AbbVie’s interferon-free treatment. AbbVie’s 3D regimen combines three drugs along with an existing medicine, ribavirin. The trial tested the treatment in 631 patients, who had received no prior treatment and had no signs of liver cirrhosis. They had the genotype 1 variant of the infection, which accounts for roughly 70 percent of hepatitis C cases. AbbVie’s shares were up about 2 percent at $49.35 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

32,ABBV,AbbVie leukemia drug impresses in early-stage trial,"(Reuters) - An experimental AbbVie Inc drug for leukemia controlled or eliminated signs of the disease in more than 80 percent of patients who had failed to benefit from previous treatments, an unprecedented finding that could spur use of the medicine for other cancers, researchers said. The AbbVie drug, ABT-199, works by blocking a protein called BCL-2 that allows cancer cells to overcome a natural mechanism called programmed cell death, in which the body kills off defective or cancerous cells. AbbVie is developing the once-daily pill in partnership with Roche Holding AG. The favorable data was seen in a phase I, or early-stage, trial involving 67 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who had not been helped by chemotherapy or relapsed from such treatment. The slowly progressing blood cancer, which mainly affects people age 65 and older, occurs when white blood cells build up in the blood, bone marrow and lymph nodes, causing them to enlarge. About 15,000 Americans are diagnosed with the disease each year. Some 84 percent of patients who took ABT-199 strongly responded to the drug, with at least a 50 percent reduction in signs of the disease. And 23 percent had complete remissions, meaning all signs of the disease vanished. “To achieve that magnitude of complete remission is extraordinarily promising and unprecedented in this particular type of leukemia, among patients with otherwise resistant disease,” Dr. John Seymour, a researcher with the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Australia, said in a telephone interview. Seymour is scheduled to present data from his trial on Tuesday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in New Orleans. In the ongoing study, 72 percent of patients remain on the drug and are well at or beyond 12 months of treatment, Seymour said. Seymour said patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia that have failed to respond to therapy typically only live another 12 to 18 months. He said it was too early to say how patients in his trial would fare. One patient in the trial died from a complication of treatment, called tumor lysis syndrome, in which killed cancer cells build up in the bloodstream. But Seymour said dosages of the drug are now slowly increased during the first few weeks of treatment, a change that has markedly decreased the lysis risk. Otherwise, he said ABT-199 was very well tolerated, with generally mild side effects such as nausea and diarrhea. “For decades BCL-2 has been a sought-after target, but up until now no other drugs have had the potency and precision of ABT-199,” Seymour said. He said other malignancies, including cancers of the breast, prostate and lung, are also fueled by BCL-2, and that ABT-199 may therefore have promise in treating them. “This compound has that potential, but we’re still at the very early stages of testing it,” Seymour said. “We’re crawling, but we’re looking forward to where we may be running in the future.” ",12082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-abbvie-leukemia/abbvie-leukemia-drug-impresses-in-early-stage-trial-idUSBRE9B706M20131208
33,ABBV,AbbVie leukemia drug impresses in early-stage trial,"Dec 8 (Reuters) - An experimental AbbVie Inc drug for leukemia controlled or eliminated signs of the disease in more than 80 percent of patients who had failed to benefit from previous treatments, an unprecedented finding that could spur use of the medicine for other cancers, researchers said. The AbbVie drug, ABT-199, works by blocking a protein called BCL-2 that allows cancer cells to overcome a natural mechanism called programmed cell death, in which the body kills off defective or cancerous cells. AbbVie is developing the once-daily pill in partnership with Roche Holding AG. The favorable data was seen in a phase I, or early-stage,  trial involving 67 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who had not been helped by chemotherapy or relapsed from such treatment. The slowly progressing blood cancer, which mainly affects people age 65 and older, occurs when white blood cells build up in the blood, bone marrow and lymph nodes, causing them to enlarge. About 15,000 Americans are diagnosed with the disease each year. Some 84 percent of patients who took ABT-199 strongly responded to the drug, with at least a 50 percent reduction in signs of the disease. And 23 percent had complete remissions, meaning all signs of the disease vanished. “To achieve that magnitude of complete remission is extraordinarily promising and unprecedented in this particular type of leukemia, among patients with otherwise resistant disease,” Dr. John Seymour, a researcher with the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Australia, said in a telephone interview.

34,ABBV,AbbVie oral hep C drugs cure 96 percent in late stage trial,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc’s all-oral hepatitis C therapy cured 96 percent of difficult-to-treat patients in a late-stage clinical trial after 12 weeks, keeping the company well placed in a highly competitive race to deliver new treatments for the serious liver disease. The study of 394 patients with the most common Genotype 1 version of the virus tested the AbbVie regimen in people who had failed to be cured by the older standard treatments of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. In results issued by AbbVie on Tuesday, nearly half of those in the Phase III trial dubbed Sapphire-II were prior null responders - a particularly difficult to treat group whose virus had no response to treatment with the older drugs. The impressive cure rate after just 12 weeks of therapy mirrors the results seen last month in another late stage study that tested the all oral AbbVie regimen in potentially less challenging patients who had received no prior treatment for their hepatitis C. Two percent of patients in the Sapphire-II trial experienced relapse or virologic breakthrough in which the virus rebounds after initially responding to treatment, while the discontinuation rate due to side effects was 1 percent. Patients in whom there is no detectable levels of the virus in the blood 12 weeks after completing 12 weeks of therapy have achieved SVR, or sustained virologic response, which is considered cured. Alex Arfaei, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said in a research note that AbbVie’s regimen “remains underappreciated” and forecast sales reaching $1.6 billion in 2017. Several companies are developing hepatitis C treatment regimens that do not require injectable interferon, which causes miserable flu like symptoms that lead many patients to discontinue or delay treatment. Gilead Sciences is widely perceived by industry analysts to be the leader in the all-oral hepatitis C field that is expected to garner billions of dollars in annual sales. Gilead last week had one of its closely watched new drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck & Co are all seen as potential rivals with oral regimens that have shown impressive cure rates and also cut the current treatment duration to 12 weeks or less from the current 24- or 48-week treatment regimens. Some analysts have said AbbVie’s ability to compete could be hampered by a larger number of pills that must be taken than some of the rival regimens. The AbbVie regimen includes three experimental direct acting antiviral drugs that each attack a different target necessary for virus replication, plus the older drug ribavirin. The drugs are the protease inhibitor ABT-450, whose effect is boosted by a widely used antiviral called ritonavir; the polymerase inhibitor ABT-333, and ABT-267 from a highly promising new class known as NS5A inhibitors. The regimen currently involves four pills a day plus typically 2 ribavirin pills a day. AbbVie, which has four more Phase III trials underway, is also testing its drugs without ribavirin - a medicine that can cause anemia and other side effects. But other companies are shooting for combination regimens that involve just one or two pills a day. “Gilead will have a convenience advantage,” Arfaei said. “However, we do not believe convenience is as important for an 8-12 week treatment regimen that produces a cure compared with for example chronic HIV treatment.” Shares of Enanta Pharmaceuticals Inc, which co-developed ABT-450 with AbbVie, were up 22.2 percent to $36.25 on Nasdaq. They are up more than 70 percent since AbbVie released data from the first Phase III trial last month. AbbVie shares were up 2.1 percent at $52.30 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

37,ABBV,AbbVie drug shows promise against difficult type of breast cancer,"(Reuters) - Women with an especially deadly type of breast cancer who received a treatment regimen containing an experimental AbbVie Inc drug prior to surgery are likely to have a significantly better response than those who get a standard chemotherapy regimen, according to data from a clinical trial. Patients with so-called triple negative breast cancer, who tend to be younger and have a very poor prognosis, appeared to have double the response rate to the regimen containing AbbVie’s veliparib in a new type of study that exploits advances in molecular understanding of the disease, researchers found. The trial dubbed I-SPY 2 is another step toward developing more personalized treatments. Its design allows researchers to continuously monitor how patients respond as the trial progresses and move patients into arms of the study testing drugs from which they are more likely to gain benefit. This type of trial should help companies select the right group of patients to enroll into larger, more traditional late stage clinical trials, potentially cutting the cost of bringing new medicines to market. Drugmakers are under increasing pressure to cut the cost of new medicines that put a huge burden on healthcare systems. One way to do that would be through more efficient, alternative testing methods that lead to fewer trial failures. “It’s a very nimble trial design that allows you to enroll a fairly small number of patients and come to a fairly high certainty of success (in later larger trials) in a specific subset of patients,” explained Dr. Hope Rugo, who presented the data at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium on Friday. If a drug combination starts to look like it is working better on patients with one type of breast cancer, the trial design allows for more patients with that type of cancer to move into that arm of the study, said Rugo, director of breast oncology and clinical trials education at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center in San Francisco. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which signed off on the trial design, has said that if a study drug helps cure significantly more cancers, it could be given a provisional type of accelerated approval. “If we can get a better idea of who benefits early, it’s going to be an enormous change in the way we test new agents, and not just for breast cancer but for other malignancies as well,” Rugo said. “You could avoid doing a 3,500 patient trial in a group of patients who you thought might benefit but don’t,” she said. “We’ll be able to get the drugs to the patients who need them much more quickly and at reduced cost.” The I-SPY program is testing a variety of experimental medicines from several drugmakers in the neoadjuvant, or pre-surgery, setting in high-risk patients. Rugo was presenting the portion of the trial that involved the AbbVie drug. In that arm of the study involving 71 high risk patients, the researchers were testing to see whether the treatment, given before surgery, could eliminate any evidence of invasive cancer in breast tissue and lymph nodes removed during subsequent surgery - a measurement known as pathologic complete response (PCR). They found an estimated PCR in 52 percent of women who were treated with AbbVie’s veliparib plus the chemotherapies carboplatin and paclitaxel. That compared with a 26 percent PCR rate in those who just got standard paclitaxel. Both groups also received anthracycline-based chemotherapy prior to surgery. “If we can increase the number of patients who have no invasive cancer, we expect that this will translate into better survival,” Rugo said. Most breast cancer tumors are estrogen-receptor positive, fueled by the hormone estrogen. About 20 percent are HER2-positive, meaning a protein called HER2 is prevalent. A third type is driven by the hormone progesterone. All of these have potentially effective treatment options even after recurrence. Triple-negative tumors - about 15 percent of breast cancers - lack estrogen, progesterone or HER2 receptors needed for most drugs to work. If the tumor does not respond to chemotherapy, there are currently no alternatives and the typical survival rate after recurrence is less than two years. More women treated with veliparib and carboplatin dropped out of the study due to side effects, whereas discontinuations in the control arm were primarily due to disease progression. Rugo said she looked forward to further study of the AbbVie drug, noting that the trial design did not separate which effects were due to veliparib and which to carboplatin. However, she said, the doubling of response rates was “very encouraging to us and suggests that veliparib is playing an important role in the enhanced response that we’re seeing.” ",12132013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-abbvie-breastcancer/abbvie-drug-shows-promise-against-difficult-type-of-breast-cancer-idUSBRE9BC0HG20131213

39,ABBV,UPDATE 3-Stellar hepatitis C data puts Gilead farther ahead of pack,"By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot Dec 18 (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc released impressive late-stage data Wednesday for its once-daily combination pill to treat hepatitis C, advancing its lead in the race to develop new, all-oral treatments for the liver disease, and pushed up its timeline for seeking U.S. approval. Gilead unveiled initial results from three Phase III studies that demonstrated cure rates well in excess of 90 percent with as little as 8 weeks of treatment for some patients, and its share price rose 5 percent. The findings were achieved without the use of either injectable interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms, or ribavirin, an antiviral pill that carries its own troublesome side effects. The tough-to-tolerate older drugs have led thousands of patients to delay treatment for the potentially fatal disease and await new options. “The results certainly raise the bar and dim the outlook for competitors such as AbbVie, Bristol-Myers and Boehringer Ingelheim,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said of rival all-oral programs in development that require more drugs and more pills than Gilead’s to achieve similarly high cure rates. Porges, saying the new data could spell the end of ribavirin use and greatly expand the number of people seeking treatment, raised his peak sales forecast for Gilead’s combination to an eye-popping $16 billion in 2016, declining to $6.8 billion by 2020 as the backlog of patients awaiting treatment declines. Stifel analyst Joel Sendek forecast 2015 sales of $5.1 billion for the Gilead pill and said AbbVie would likely have offer its hepatitis treatment at a discount to compete. Gilead said it would file in the first quarter of 2014 for U.S. approval of the combination treatment that pairs its just-approved Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) and its experimental ledipasvir. The company previously said it would seek marketing approval in the first half of next year. Gilead shares closed up $3.51, or 5 percent, at $73.59 on Nasdaq. The Phase III trials tested the combination pill in subjects with the most common, but hardest to treat, genotype 1 strain of the liver virus in both previously untreated patients and those who had failed to be helped by prior treatment. They also included patients with cirrhosis, who tend to be farther along in the liver-destroying disease. Sovaldi, which costs about $84,000 for a course of treatment, belongs to a class of drugs known as nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitors, or “nukes,” designed to block an enzyme the hepatitis C virus needs to copy itself. Ledipasvir belongs to a promising new class of drugs that work by blocking the NS5A protein, which the virus also needs to replicate. Current standard regimens include both interferon and ribavirin and must be taken for 24 to 48 weeks, curing about 75 percent of patients. Gilead tested its combo pill at a variety of treatment durations both with and without ribavirin. But the high cure rates without ribavirin, which can cause rash, anemia and other side effects, are likely to grab most of the attention of physicians and investors. In a study of 647 previously untreated patients without cirrhosis called ION-3, 94 percent achieved sustained virologic response (SVR), which is considered cured, after just 8 weeks of treatment, rising to 95.4 percent with a 12-week regimen. In ION 2 - a trial of 440 more difficult to treat patients who were not cured by prior treatment, including 88 cirrhotics - 93.6 percent were cured by the once daily pill after 12 weeks, while the cure rate rose to 99.1 percent with 24 weeks of treatment. In ION-1, which looked at 865 previously untreated patients, including 136 with cirrhosis, the Gilead pill cured 97.7 percent with 12 weeks of therapy. “In general, the data position Gilead to dominate the genotype 1 landscape,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a research note. He noted that Gilead’s ribavirin-free regimen involved one pill once a day, while AbbVie’s is six pills a day with ribavirin and four pills without, and includes a medicine that may interact with other drugs. Genotype 1 accounts for about 70 percent of U.S. infections. Hepatitis C affects an estimated 170 million people worldwide, and if left untreated can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer, or the need for a new liver. Bernstein’s Porges said given the convenience and cure rates of the new drugs, the hepatitis C conversation is likely to change from disease management to eradication. “This is going to be very tempting for people to say, ‘We can lick this’,” Porges said. But he noted that demand for the drug will eventually decline as patients are cured. “The long-term economics of curing patients is not good for the drug industry, but it’s totally great for society.”",12182013,http://www.reuters.com/article/gilead-hepatitis/update-3-stellar-hepatitis-c-data-puts-gilead-farther-ahead-of-pack-idUSL2N0JX0TY20131218

45,ABBV,AbbVie drops legal action in EU drug secrecy case,"LONDON (Reuters) - AbbVie, one of the two U.S. companies trying to stop Europe’s drugs regulator from releasing previously secret clinical trials data, said on Thursday it had withdrawn lawsuits against the watchdog. The decision follows a move by the London-based European Medicines Agency (EMA) to accept a new set of redacted documents submitted by AbbVie, along with the company’s rationale for removing certain commercially confidential information. “A significant portion of data will be disclosed while protecting the information that is commercially sensitive,” AbbVie said in a statement. “As a result, AbbVie has withdrawn its lawsuits.” The EMA said the “very limited redactions” would have no significant impact on the readability of the clinical study reports that were at the center of the litigation. The legal row between the EMA, AbbVie and a second drugmaker, InterMune, has thrown a spotlight on attempts by parts of the pharmaceutical industry keep its data secret, even as many doctors and campaigners demand greater transparency. For AbbVie, the case was significant because the clinical trial data at stake related to its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira, which is the world’s top-selling prescription medicine. Medical researchers and patient groups want access to detailed clinical trial data to improve third-party scrutiny of the drugs industry and to allow independent scientists to stress-test claims about drugs. But many companies fear that complete disclosure of all information will damage their businesses and undermine the ability to defend patents. The London-based watchdog has been on a collision course with much of the industry since pledging in 2010 to lift the lid on previously secret trial data submitted by companies as part of the application process for new medicines. The scale of the data releases was to have been increased significantly this year under the EMA plans. But the process was stalled by the legal battle with AbbVie and InterMune. The European consumer organization BEUC, which was involved in the case as an official participant in favor of the EMA, said AbbVie’s decision was a significant first step forward. “It is our strong hope that InterMune, the other complainant, will follow suit,” said Ilaria Passarani, head of BEUC’s food and health department. The EMA said the other court case brought by InterMune against the agency, challenging a decision to grant access to clinical-study reports, was ongoing. AbbVie’s decision to drop its lawsuits comes just one day after the European Parliament voted in favor of new legislation governing clinical trials that will force drug companies to be more transparent in releasing study results.

48,ABBV,AbbVie urges U.S. court to avoid gay rights issue in HIV drug case,"(Reuters) - An Abbott Laboratories spinoff urged a federal appeals court to revisit a ruling in a case against GlaxoSmithKline Plc, but without disturbing landmark constitutional protections for gays and lesbians. In a brief filed with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Thursday, AbbVie Inc said the full court should review an initial three-judge decision that found a gay man was improperly excluded from jury service due to his sexual orientation. The court in reaching that conclusion in January ordered a new trial for GlaxoSmithKline Plc against AbbVie, which contended Thursday that the 9th Circuit’s ruling needed review due to its potential to affect “thousands of jury trials.” But AbbVie said it is not asking for the court to reconsider a holding that heightened the constitutional protections judges in several Western states must now apply when evaluating laws that curtail gay rights. “Abbott condemns discrimination in all forms, including in jury selection, and no discrimination occurred here,” Abbott’s lawyers wrote. A spokeswoman for Glaxo did not respond to a request for comment. The case involved Abbott’s pricing of HIV medications, a contentious issue in the gay community. Glaxo accused Abbott of improperly increasing the price of one drug, Norvir, to help it preserve sales growth of one of its other HIV blockbusters, Kaletra. Norvir plays a key role in AIDS-fighting cocktails because it can boost the effectiveness of other drugs. Glaxo accused Abbott of raising Norvir’s price by 400 percent in 2003, as part of an effort to harm competitors whose drugs were dependent on being used in combination with Norvir. Glaxo had sought $571 million, but after a four-week trial came away with only a $3.5 million jury award. AbbVie had initially let the deadline to seek 9th Circuit reconsideration pass, and the company said March 10 it would not seek to appeal the 9th Circuit’s landmark ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. But on March 27, the 9th Circuit, without prompting from the parties, instructed AbbVie and Glaxo to address whether a larger panel of judges should review the case. Dirk Van Eeden, a spokesman for AbbVie, said the company opposes discrimination. But AbbVie is “raising the fact that a well-established procedure in jury selection was not followed,” he said. “This omission may have important privacy implications for potential jurors, such as the possibility of having to disclose their sexual orientation in court and under oath,” he said. “These implications go beyond the underlying case and may warrant a larger panel’s consideration.” The case in the 9th Circuit is Smithkline Beecham Corp dba GlaxoSmithKline vs. Abbott Laboratories, 11-17357.

53,ABBV,UPDATE 2-AbbVie 1st-qtr profit beats estimates; Humira sales soar,"(Adds analyst comments, background on Humira, byline, updates stock price) By Ransdell Pierson April 25 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc  reported better-than-expected quarterly sales and earnings, fueled by a sizzling performance from its Humira treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, the world’s top-selling prescription medicine. Company shares rose 2.6 percent in early trading. Humira sales soared 17.5 percent to $2.64 billion, and represented almost 58 percent of the company’s total sales, it said on Friday, accelerating from a 13 percent gain for the injectable drug in the prior quarter. “Humira’s growth was a little more than we expected and price increases in the United States are probably a big reason,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. Humira sales came in $90 million above his forecast. Conover said Humira is one of the most effective treatments for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases, and has milder side effects than many rival drugs. “So it can get away with big price increases,” without great resistance from insurers. The big question is how long will Humira be AbbVie’s cash cow and earnings driver. Although Humira’s U.S. patent lapses in late 2016, AbbVie officials have predicted it will take years for other drugmakers to develop their own version of Humira and win approval. To lessen its reliance on Humira, the company is attempting to develop treatments for hepatitis C, cancer and other diseases. It expects approval later this year for a multi-pill treatment for hepatitis C, a potentially fatal liver disease that affects more than 3 million Americans. Analysts believe it eventually could rake in peak annual sales of $3 billion. The regimen would compete with highly effective new oral drugs from other drugmakers, including Gilead Sciences Inc’s  hot-selling Sovaldi, which can wipe out the hepatitis C virus months faster than older treatments, with far milder side effects. AbbVie said it earned $980 million, or 61 cents per share, in the first quarter, up from $968 million, or 60 cents, in the year-ago period. Excluding special charges, AbbVie earned 71 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected 68 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Global revenues for AbbVie, spun off from Abbott Laboratories Inc early last year, rose 5.4 percent to $4.56 billion, above Wall Street expectations of $4.33 billion. Sales would have risen 6.7 percent, if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the value of sales outside the United States. The suburban Chicago-based company still expects full-year 2014 earnings of $3.00 to $3.10 per share, excluding special items. AbbVie shares rose $1.31 to $50.63 on the New York Stock Exchange.

56,ABBV,AbbVie says hepatitis C regimen gets nod for FDA priority review,"June 13 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators have granted priority review for AbbVie Inc’s experimental all-oral regimen for patients infected with the most common genotype of hepatitis C virus, the company said on Friday. The priority review means the Food and Drug Administration will likely decide within six months whether to approve the regimen, which was submitted to the agency on April 21. AbbVie said it had submitted in May marketing applications for regulatory approval in the European Union. AbbVie’s regimen consists of protease inhibitor ABT-450, boosted by a widely used antiviral called ritonavir, combined with polymerase inhibitor dasabuvir, and NS5A inhibitor ombitasvir with or without the older antiviral drug ribavirin. Gilead Sciences Inc, which launched breakthrough hepatitis C drug Sovaldi in December, is slated to hear from the FDA on its application for an all-oral regimen - which combines Sovaldi with experimental NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir - by early October. Prior to Sovaldi’s approval, hepatitis C needed to be treated for at least six months with a combination of pills and injections that could cause severe flu-like symptoms and other side effects that led many people to avoid or discontinue treatment.

57,ABBV,"Biogen, AbbVie drug slows MS episodes, safety issues recur","(Reuters) - A drug approved to prevent rejection of transplanted kidneys significantly reduced relapses of multiple sclerosis in a late stage-trial sponsored by Biogen Idec and AbbVie Inc, but serious infections and potential liver toxicity continued to cloud the drug’s future. The Phase III international study of the medicine, called daclizumab, involved more than 1,800 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, the most common form of MS, which can lead to disability and paralysis.  The companies disclosed partial results from the new trial on Monday.  The study, called DECIDE, tested monthly injections of daclizumab against weekly injections of Biogen’s blockbuster Avonex (interferon beta-1a) treatment for MS.  Patients taking daclizumab, which is meant to tame the immune system by blocking a protein called the CD25 receptor, had 45 percent fewer annual relapses than those receiving Avonex. In addition, patients taking daclizumab had 54 percent  fewer new or enlarging brain and spinal lesions at week 96 of the study, compared to those taking Avonex; those results met a secondary goal of the study. The overall incidence of side effects was similar in both patient groups. But there was a two-fold higher incidence of serious infections among those taking daclizumab, at 4 percent, as well as a two-fold higher incidence of elevated liver enzymes - a potential marker for liver toxicity. Daclizumab would be a new approach to treating MS, if it is approved for the condition. Alex Arfaei, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said the decline in annual relapses seen with daclizumab was a bit less impressive than the reductions of 52 percent, versus Avonex, achieved in earlier trials by the oral medication Gilenya, which is made by Novartis AG. Gilenya had sales of $1.9 billion last year. “Our first impression is that these results are good enough for (daclizumab) to be competitive” with Gilenya and other oral treatments, Arfaei said in a research note. He predicted the Biogen/AbbVie drug could be introduced in 2016 and conservatively generate U.S. sales of $256 million by 2018. Biogen and AbbVie said they would discuss with health regulators the timing for potential marketing applications for daclizumab.  Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG introduced daclizumab in 1997 to prevent rejection of transplanted kidneys, under the brand name Zenapax. It stopped selling the drug in 2009 due to poor sales and the availability of newer treatments. Multiple sclerosis is believed to be caused by overactive immune system cells, called t-cells, that attack and destroy the protective covering of nerves.

60,ABBV,Exclusive: AbbVie approaches Shire about possible takeover - sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) has recently approached London-listed Shire PLC (SHP.L) about a potential takeover, according to people familiar with the matter, marking the latest attempt by U.S. healthcare companies looking to acquire overseas rivals partly to lower their tax rates.  AbbVie, which makes rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, has a market capitalization of around $86 billion, while Shire has a market capitalization of roughly $38 billion. The companies have held talks in recent weeks following AbbVie’s takeover approach, but there is no guarantee the discussions will lead to a transaction, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. Both parties have exchanged letters about a potential deal, the people said.  It is also possible that other suitors will emerge for Shire, the people added. AbbVie said it does not comment on speculation and Shire could not be immediately reached for comment.  Founded in 1986 in Britain, Shire conducts most of its business in the United States and has been domiciled in Ireland for tax purposes since 2008. With its tax base in Ireland, where effective corporate tax rates are among the lowest in the world, Shire, with a mid-sized market value, has been seen as a prime takeover target for U.S. drugmakers. Shire is weighing AbbVie’s approach against the merits of remaining independent, as its chief executive Fleming Ornskov has only completed his first year on the job and has an alternative strategy of growing through acquisitions, one of the people said. Shire specializes in medicines for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which account for around 40 percent of its sales. The firm also sells pricey drugs to treat rare genetic disorders and is building up a portfolio of treatments in ophthalmology and other specialty disease areas. AbbVie, based in North Chicago, Illinois, was founded last year as a spin-off from Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N). The company has been criticized for its overreliance on its top drug, Humira, which comprised over half of its revenue in the most recent quarter.  To lessen its reliance on Humira, the company is attempting to develop treatments for hepatitis C, cancer and other diseases. Shire had also been approached by Allergan Inc (AGN.N) in the months before the Botox maker itself became a takeover target for Valeant, Reuters previously reported. That approach did not lead to serious discussions between the two parties and there are currently no talks with Allergan, Reuters reported earlier this week.  U.S. pharmaceutical companies are in a race to keep up with rivals and are looking at lowering their tax rates in order to do so, in what is called as an inversion. Recent inversion deals have included medical device company Medtronic Inc’s (MDT.N) $42.9 billion deal for Covidien this week, as well as Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) abortive $118 billion bid for AstraZeneca PLC (AZN.L). Some U.S. lawmakers are concerned that the deals erode government revenue by giving corporations another tax-avoiding loophole. Two bills in the U.S. Congress and a White House proposal would make inversions harder to do, but neither has gained much traction.

62,ABBV,Shire rejects AbbVie's $46 billion takeover bid,"LONDON (Reuters) - British drugmaker Shire (SHP.L) has rejected a 27 billion-pound  ($46 billion) takeover offer from AbbVie (ABBV.N), the latest attempt by a U.S. healthcare firm to tap into lower tax rates abroad via an acquisition. Shire, which has no single controlling shareholder, has been seen as a prime takeover target for U.S. drugmakers due to its attractive rare diseases business and its Irish tax base.  Saying its annual product sales are set to more than double by 2020 to $10 billion, Shire rejected the 46.26 pounds per share offer as failing to reflect its true value, despite the offer being at a 30 percent premium to its share price over the last month. But analysts and one large shareholder said the firm may struggle to resist a bid of over 50 pounds per share. “You can easily see other people coming for Shire now because it’s in a good space,” one of Shire’s 40 biggest shareholders told Reuters. “Their pipeline is fantastic, it’s growing at 20 percent so for them (Abbvie) to offer 46 quid for that sort of growth profile we think is not enough. If they came back with 50-plus people would find it difficult (to say no) and that would be very sad.” Founded in 1986 in Britain, Shire conducts most of its business in the United States and has been domiciled in Ireland for tax purposes since 2008.  AbbVie’s takeover offer proposed creating a new U.S.-listed holding company with a tax domicile in Britain, where the government has also introduced tax breaks designed to encourage research and development. The approach marks the latest in a long line of mergers proposed by U.S. firms seeking to lower their tax rates, and comes less than a month after the collapse of Pfizer’s (PFE.N) $118 billion bid for AstraZeneca (AZN.L) which was also motivated in part by tax considerations.     Ireland’s corporation tax rate currently sits at 12.5 percent, one of the lowest in the world, while Britain has been cutting its rate from 28 percent in 2010 to 21 percent this year and 20 percent from 2015, well below the U.S. headline rate of 35 percent plus local taxes. Tax advisers say the British system also enables international companies to lower their tax rates in other ways.   Shire said the offer from AbbVie not only undervalued the company’s prospects but “the board also had concerns regarding the execution risks associated with the proposed (tax) inversion structure, as AbbVie would redomicile in the UK for tax purposes.” AbbVie was first to release a statement confirming that its offer had been rejected, after Reuters revealed the talks late on Thursday. Confirmation of the offer could kick off a bidding war for Shire, with sector bankers expecting the group to also prove appealing to U.S. pharmaceutical and biotech firms such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N), Amgen (AMGN.O), Gilead (GILD.O) and Biogen (BIIB.O).  Shire’s share price was up 15 percent at over 43 pounds by 1150 GMT, valuing the firm at over 25 billion pounds ($43 billion). Shire said the rejected offer comprised 0.7988 AbbVie shares and 20.44 pounds in cash for every Shire share. AbbVie, which has a market capitalisation of around $86 billion, said it made an initial cash and share proposal in early May with an indicative value of 39.50 pounds per share. It did not describe the latest offer as final, meaning it could come back with an even higher price and has been given a deadline under UK takeover rules to either make a firm intention to make an offer, or walk away, by 1600 GMT on July 18.  However, analysts at Barclays said that the cost synergies and tax inversion benefits of the existing offer could be limited. “With no obvious therapeutic overlaps between AbbVie and Shire, the prospect for cost savings appears limited to us,” they said. “We would view Shire as very much a bolt-on acquisition for AbbVie, albeit one with a $47 billion price tag. “We also believe the cash component of AbbVie’s current proposal is on the cusp of what it can come up with,” the analysts said, adding, however, that a deal would help AbbVie to become less reliant on its rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira. Shire, which specialises in medicines for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and drugs to treat rare genetic disorders, was previously approached by Botox-maker Allergan (AGN.N) months before the U.S. group itself became a takeover target for Valeant (VRX.TO).  Shire is being advised by Citi, Evercore and Morgan Stanley whilst Abbvie is being advising by JPMorgan.

Shares in Shire rose 13 percent to 42.31 pounds after AbbVie confirmed it had made a bid approach, which was rejected by Shire’s board. AbbVie said its final indicative offer was worth 46.26 pounds, adding talks are no longer ongoing. Shire has been seen as a prime takeover target for U.S. drugmakers thanks to a mid-sized market value and its tax base in Ireland, where effective corporate tax rates are among the lowest in the world. “I’d probably take some profit there and then go back in,” said Mike Reuter, a broker at Tradition. “The stock won’t crash. It’s an M&A; candidate and I think there will be an offer, eventually.” Shire’s stock added 0.8 points to the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300, which was up 1.3 points, or 0.1 percent, at 1,396.91 points at 0743 GMT. The index, which hit a 6-1/2 year high on Thursday, was on track for its 10th consecutive weekly gain, extending its longest winning run since August 2012. Among top fallers was Norway’s Telenor, down 2.3 percent after the country’s trade minister said the government would ask parliament for the right to cut its stake in the telecommunications company and industrial group Kongsberg Gruppen. State-controlled French utility EDF fell 1.3 percent, down for a second day as analysts at UBS and Natixis cut their target price on the stock in light of the government’s decision to scrap a planned increase in electricity prices. “The 2013 re-rating of EDF was to a large extent driven by a change in investor perception, because the regulatory environment seemed to become more reliable and predictable,” UBS analysts wrote in a note. “Therefore, the cancellation of the already agreed tariff hike could lead to an increased risk perception on lower regulatory visibility.” Around Europe, the Euro STOXX 50 index of euro zone blue chips was down 0.1 percent while Britain’s FTSE  added 0.3 percent.

72,ABBV,Shire flags new drugs in AstraZeneca-style defence to AbbVie,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shire (SHP.L) flagged the promise of existing and new drugs on Monday as evidence that AbbVie’s (ABBV.N) $46 billion offer undervalued the company, the latest British firm to be targeted by a U.S. group seeking lower taxes. Shire is taking a leaf out of AstraZeneca’s (AZN.L) playbook by disclosing long-range internal forecasts - a tactic used successfully by its larger London-listed rival in fending off a $118 billion bid from Pfizer (PFE.N).  Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov said on Monday that current products would generate sales of at least $7 billion by 2020, with $3 billion more coming from drugs still in the pipeline. Shire also said that in the medium term it expected sales of $6.5 billion by 2016. The company, best known for hyperactivity and rare-disease drugs, had said on Friday it was aiming to more than double sales to $10 billion by 2020 without giving details. Ornskov told Reuters that actual sales could be far above $10 billion, since the long-term forecasts did not include revenue from future deal-making or from two recent transactions. “M&A; will clearly add growth to the profile,” he said in an interview, noting that the London-listed company had done six deals since he took over 13 months ago. “If I included that in the upside it would be way north of $10 billion.” Shire is a serial acquirer, buying rare disease specialist Viropharma for $4.2 billion last November in its biggest deal yet - and Ornskov said further “large” deals were possible. As with AstraZeneca’s earlier upbeat long-term forecasts, many industry analysts view Shire’s $10 billion sales prediction as optimistic, with Credit Suisse saying its own estimates suggested sales of around $8 billion by 2020. Nonetheless, the confident performance may encourage AbbVie to dig deeper after the two companies confirmed a series of approaches following a Reuters report last week.  Analysts at Jefferies estimated the U.S. company could make the deal pay at a price of up to 55 pounds a share, or $55 billion, against AbbVie’s most recent rejected cash-and-shares offer on May 30 of just over 46 pounds.  Shares in Shire, which hit a all-time high on Friday, ended 1.6 percent lower at 43.03 pounds. Key drugs that Ornskov expects to drive continued strong growth include its best-selling hyperactivity medicine Vyvanse, which is now also being tested as a treatment for binge eating, as well as a much-anticipated drug for dry eye disease called lifitegrast, which it sees as a potential $1 billion-plus seller. Shire is famous for drugs to treat children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder but Ornskov said it had become “more and more a rare disease company”. The market had yet to catch up fully with the rapid growth and high margins this shift implied, he argued, pointing to the 99 percent total shareholder return achieved since he took over last May. Shire’s strategy copies AstraZeneca’s in another way, too, by highlighting the execution risks associated with AbbVie’s plan to cut its tax bill through redomiciling in Britain for tax purposes - an industry-wide ploy that has sparked growing political concerns.  Such so-called “inversions” by U.S. companies have moved centre-stage in the pharmaceuticals sector this year, with those firms still paying high tax rates anxious to strike deals that will help them compete with rivals now enjoying lower taxes. Whether Shire, long viewed as a likely takeover target, escapes the clutches of a larger predator is uncertain and the company is widely seen as more vulnerable to a takeover by AbbVie - or another company - than AstraZeneca.  That reflects both its smaller size, which makes it a more manageable target for a wider range of players, and the lack of attendant political issues in Britain, where the company has a relatively small workforce.

73,ABBV,UPDATE 2-Shire flags new drugs in AstraZeneca-style defence to AbbVie,"* Long-range forecasts for drugs a central plank of defence * Vyvanse for binge eating, new eye drug among highlights * Deals could push 2020 sales “way north” of $10 bln -CEO * Credit Suisse analysts currently peg 2020 sales at $8 bln * $46 bln offer from AbbVie rejected as undervaluing group   (Adds closing shares, Breakingviews link) By Ben Hirschler LONDON, June 23 (Reuters) - Shire flagged the promise of existing and new drugs on Monday as evidence that AbbVie’s $46 billion offer undervalued the company, the latest British firm to be targeted by a U.S. group seeking lower taxes. Shire is taking a leaf out of AstraZeneca’s playbook by disclosing long-range internal forecasts - a tactic used successfully by its larger London-listed rival in fending off a $118 billion bid from Pfizer. Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov said on Monday that current products would generate sales of at least $7 billion by 2020, with $3 billion more coming from drugs still in the pipeline. Shire also said that in the medium term it expected sales of $6.5 billion by 2016. The company, best known for hyperactivity and rare-disease drugs, had said on Friday it was aiming to more than double sales to $10 billion by 2020 without giving details. Ornskov told Reuters that actual sales could be far above $10 billion, since the long-term forecasts did not include revenue from future deal-making or from two recent transactions. “M&A; will clearly add growth to the profile,” he said in an interview, noting that the London-listed company had done six deals since he took over 13 months ago. “If I included that in the upside it would be way north of $10 billion.” Shire is a serial acquirer, buying rare disease specialist Viropharma for $4.2 billion last November in its biggest deal yet - and Ornskov said further “large” deals were possible. As with AstraZeneca’s earlier upbeat long-term forecasts, many industry analysts view Shire’s $10 billion sales prediction as optimistic, with Credit Suisse saying its own estimates suggested sales of around $8 billion by 2020. Nonetheless, the confident performance may encourage AbbVie to dig deeper after the two companies confirmed a series of approaches following a Reuters report last week. Analysts at Jefferies estimated the U.S. company could make the deal pay at a price of up to 55 pounds a share, or $55 billion, against AbbVie’s most recent rejected cash-and-shares offer on May 30 of just over 46 pounds. Shares in Shire, which hit a all-time high on Friday, ended 1.6 percent lower at 43.03 pounds. Key drugs that Ornskov expects to drive continued strong growth include its best-selling hyperactivity medicine Vyvanse, which is now also being tested as a treatment for binge eating, as well as a much-anticipated drug for dry eye disease called lifitegrast, which it sees as a potential $1 billion-plus seller. Shire is famous for drugs to treat children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder but Ornskov said it had become “more and more a rare disease company”. The market had yet to catch up fully with the rapid growth and high margins this shift implied, he argued, pointing to the 99 percent total shareholder return achieved since he took over last May. Shire’s strategy copies AstraZeneca’s in another way, too, by highlighting the execution risks associated with AbbVie’s plan to cut its tax bill through redomiciling in Britain for tax purposes - an industry-wide ploy that has sparked growing political concerns. Such so-called “inversions” by U.S. companies have moved centre-stage in the pharmaceuticals sector this year, with those firms still paying high tax rates anxious to strike deals that will help them compete with rivals now enjoying lower taxes.

79,ABBV,UPDATE 1-U.S. court refuses to undo gay rights ruling in pharma case,"(Adds company statements, case background) By Dan Levine SAN FRANCISCO, June 24 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday refused to disturb an order extending landmark constitutional protections for gays and lesbians, an issue which arose when a gay man was excluded from jury service at a trial between AbbVie Inc and GlaxoSmithKline Plc. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in January had found that the man was improperly excluded because of his sexual orientation. The court’s January opinion, from a three-judge panel, heightened constitutional protections judges in several Western states must now apply when evaluating laws that curtail gay rights. The court ordered a new trial between Glaxo and AbbVie, an Abbott Laboratories spinoff. AbbVie requested that the full court rehear the order for a new trial but leave in place the pro-gay rights language. On Tuesday, the 9th Circuit refused. AbbVie spokesman Dirk Van Eeden said the company was studying the latest decision. Glaxo spokesman Marc Meacham said the Glaxo was “gratified that the court has once again ruled in our favor and sustained the order for a new trial.” The case involved Abbott’s pricing of HIV medications, a contentious issue in the gay community. Glaxo accused Abbott of improperly increasing the price of one drug, Norvir, to help it preserve sales growth of one of its other HIV blockbusters, Kaletra. Norvir plays a key role in AIDS-fighting cocktails because it can boost the effectiveness of other drugs. Glaxo accused Abbott of raising Norvir’s price by 400 percent in 2003, as part of an effort to harm competitors whose drugs were dependent on being used in combination with Norvir. Glaxo had sought $571 million, but after a four-week trial came away with only a $3.5 million jury award. The 9th Circuit currently has 29 full time judges, and three of them publicly dissented from the court’s decision on Tuesday. Judge Diarmuid O’Scannlain wrote that the U.S. Supreme Court did not mandate higher constitutional protections for gays and lesbians in the manner decided by the 9th Circuit. What started as an antitrust dispute between drug companies “has morphed into a constitutional essay about equal protection and sexual orientation,” O’Scannlain wrote, adding that the 9th Circuit got the case “egregiously” wrong. The case in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is Smithkline Beecham Corp dba GlaxoSmithKline vs. Abbott Laboratories, No. 11-17357.

80,ABBV,AbbVie presses case for Shire deal and urges talks,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker AbbVie (ABBV.N) said on Wednesday it wanted to move rapidly to clinch a takeover of Shire (SHP.L) as it set out the strategic rationale for buying the London-listed company, which has spurned its $46 billion offer.  AbbVie called for talks and said it was willing to move “quickly and cooperatively” to get a deal, arguing it would create more value from Shire’s assets than the hyperactivity and rare diseases specialist could do on its own. One person familiar with the matter said AbbVie, which stands to cut its tax bill through the deal, could consider bidding more but first wanted to explain its case to Shire shareholders and hear their views on valuation. Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez and AbbVie’s senior management plan to meet with U.S. investors in New York on Thursday and Friday, with further meetings planned for London next week, sources close to the situation said. Questioned by analysts, Gonzalez declined to rule out a hostile bid but said his preference was to engage with Shire’s management to better understand the upbeat drug sales forecasts set out by the company on Monday. Gonzalez said he was “even more interested” in Shire after hearing its plans to more than double sales by 2020 - but he questioned some of the assumptions behind the bullish figures. Buying Shire for $46 billion would boost adjusted earnings per share “materially” in the first year following completion, growing to above $1 per share by 2020, AbbVie added - a comment some analysts said suggested it had plenty of room to increase its bid. Although the U.S. group insisted its proposal offered “compelling” immediate value, with significant future upside, many investors believe it will have to pay more than 50 pounds a share to get a deal done, rather than the 46.26 pounds implied in its last cash-and-shares offer. Shire said AbbVie’s announcement provided no material new information and reiterated its belief that the offer fundamentally undervalued the company.   Barclays and Jefferies analysts said the U.S. company could make a Shire deal pay at a price of up to 55 pounds and 65 pounds a share, respectively, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch put the theoretical takeout range at 50-62 pounds. Buying Shire would allow AbbVie to join a growing number of companies to move their tax base out of the United States and would give it an effective tax rate of around 13 percent by 2016, against 22 percent last year. The enlarged company would be managed from Chicago, listed in New York and incorporated in the British island of Jersey. It is the second attempt by a U.S. pharmaceutical company to buy a London-listed rival, after Pfizer’s (PFE.N) $118 billion pursuit of AstraZeneca (AZN.L) failed last month. Despite criticism from Shire that the nature of the deal would create risks for shareholders, AbbVie said it had thoroughly assessed the tax and structuring aspects and believed the transaction was “highly executable”.  AbbVie’s pitch comes as Shire won new ammunition for arguing its worth following a U.S. court decision backing patent claims on its top-selling hyperactivity drug Vyvanse. AbbVie is eager to buy Shire, both to reduce taxation by redomiciling in Britain - a tactic known as inversion - and to diversify its drug portfolio. The U.S. company currently gets nearly 60 percent of its revenue from rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, the world’s top-selling medicine, which loses U.S. patent protection in late 2016. But Gonzalez needs to sell AbbVie’s marketing clout and financial strength to Shire shareholders, since they would end up owning shares in the enlarged group. AbbVie has already raised its profit forecast for 2014, citing a strong business performance. AbbVie was created as a spin-off from Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) and listed in January last year, since when Gonzalez said it had delivered a 64 percent total return to shareholders. Shares in Shire, which surged on Friday after news of AbbVie’s takeover offer emerged, hit a new all-time high of 46.63 pounds before slipping back to close 2.6 percent higher at 45.17 pounds, while the Stoxx Europe 600 drugs sector index .SXDP lost 0.8 percent.  Shire’s chief executive Flemming Ornskov said on Monday he was happy for the company to be sold at the right price, if the board recommended it, as he set out a detailed case as to why AbbVie’s offer fell short. Under British takeover rules AbbVie has until July 18 to announce a firm offer for Shire or walk away.

The summary judgment in Shire’s favour, handed down by the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, blocks five generic drug manufacturers from launching cheap copies of the hyperactivity drug before 2023, unless they win the case on appeal. Although many analysts had assumed the patents would hold, the ruling that Shire’s claims protecting its medicine were both infringed and valid removes an uncertainty, and shares in the London-listed group rose more than 1 percent on Wednesday. AbbVie is now preparing its next move, after having three separate takeover approaches rejected. The U.S. company - eager to buy Shire to cut its tax bill and diversify its drug portfolio - is weighing an increased bid, but plans first to talk to Shire shareholders to explain its case and get their feedback on valuation, according to a person familiar with the matter. AbbVie is keen to set out the strategic rationale for the deal, as well as the tax benefits of redomiciling in the UK, and the senior management led by Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez could present to investors as early as this week, he added. Officials at AbbVie declined to comment on the company’s plans. Shire CEO Flemming Ornskov said on Monday he was happy for the company to be sold at the right price, if the board recommended it, as he set out a detailed case as to why the last AbbVie offer of just over 46 pounds in cash and shares fell far short. Shire expects its sales to more than double to at least $10 billion a year by 2020, fuelled by existing and new drugs - including an important contribution from Vyvanse, which is also being studied as a treatment for binge eating in addition to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Investors believe AbbVie will have to raise its offer to win over Shire, with analysts at both Jefferies and Barclays arguing the U.S. company could make a Shire deal pay at a price of up to 55 pounds a share, or $55 billion. Some shareholders have also made clear they are looking for a price above 50 pounds. Shares in Shire, which hit a all-time high on Friday after news of AbbVie’s takeover offers emerged, gained 1.2 percent to 44.55 by 0755 GMT, while the European drugs sector  slipped 0.6 percent. Shire said the New Jersey court case meant generics companies Actavis, Amneal, Mylan, Roxane and Novartis’s Sandoz unit cannot launch until Shire’s patent cover ends in 2023, unless they win the case at appeal, the London-listed company said. To appeal successfully, the companies would have to overturn rulings for each of 18 different patent claims, it added. “We are extremely pleased with the court’s ruling, which affirms Shire’s belief that it has strong patents protecting Vyvanse,” Ornskov said in a statement.

Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov said on Monday that current products would generate sales of at least $7 billion by 2020, with $3 billion more coming from drugs still in the pipeline. Shire also said that in the medium term it expected sales of $6.5 billion by 2016. The company, best known for hyperactivity and rare-disease drugs, had said on Friday it was aiming to more than double sales to $10 billion by 2020 without giving details. Ornskov told Reuters that actual sales could be far above $10 billion, since the long-term forecasts did not include revenue from future deal-making or from two recent transactions. “M&A; will clearly add growth to the profile,” he said in an interview, noting that the London-listed company had done six deals since he took over 13 months ago. “If I included that in the upside it would be way north of $10 billion.” Shire is a serial acquirer, buying rare disease specialist Viropharma for $4.2 billion last November in its biggest deal yet - and Ornskov said further “large” deals were possible. As with AstraZeneca’s earlier upbeat long-term forecasts, many industry analysts view Shire’s $10 billion sales prediction as optimistic, with Credit Suisse saying its own estimates suggested sales of around $8 billion by 2020. Nonetheless, the confident performance may encourage AbbVie to dig deeper after the two companies confirmed a series of approaches following a Reuters report last week.  Analysts at Jefferies estimated the U.S. company could make the deal pay at a price of up to 55 pounds a share, or $55 billion, against AbbVie’s most recent rejected cash-and-shares offer on May 30 of just over 46 pounds.  Shares in Shire, which hit a all-time high on Friday, ended 1.6 percent lower at 43.03 pounds. Key drugs that Ornskov expects to drive continued strong growth include its best-selling hyperactivity medicine Vyvanse, which is now also being tested as a treatment for binge eating, as well as a much-anticipated drug for dry eye disease called lifitegrast, which it sees as a potential $1 billion-plus seller. Shire is famous for drugs to treat children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder but Ornskov said it had become “more and more a rare disease company”. The market had yet to catch up fully with the rapid growth and high margins this shift implied, he argued, pointing to the 99 percent total shareholder return achieved since he took over last May. Shire’s strategy copies AstraZeneca’s in another way, too, by highlighting the execution risks associated with AbbVie’s plan to cut its tax bill through redomiciling in Britain for tax purposes - an industry-wide ploy that has sparked growing political concerns.  Such so-called “inversions” by U.S. companies have moved center-stage in the pharmaceuticals sector this year, with those firms still paying high tax rates anxious to strike deals that will help them compete with rivals now enjoying lower taxes. Whether Shire, long viewed as a likely takeover target, escapes the clutches of a larger predator is uncertain and the company is widely seen as more vulnerable to a takeover by AbbVie - or another company - than AstraZeneca.  That reflects both its smaller size, which makes it a more manageable target for a wider range of players, and the lack of attendant political issues in Britain, where the company has a relatively small workforce. Although established in Britain in 1986 and listed in London, Shire conducts most of its business in the United States and has been resident in Ireland for tax purposes since 2008. Other companies that industry sources say have looked at Shire in the past include Allergan AGN.L, itself the target of a takeover approach by Valeant (VRX.TO). Banking sources suggest Shire could also appeal to groups such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Gilead Sciences (GILD.O).  Ornskov declined to comment on whether Shire had received approaches from companies other than AbbVie. One senior banker described Shire as a “valued inversion target” but he stressed that potential bidders still needed to demonstrate a tie-up also made strategic sense.  For AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez, Shire fits the bill in one important respect: it offers a way to reduce his firm’s over-reliance on rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, the world’s top-selling medicine, which accounted for 58 percent of the company’s sales in the first quarter but which loses U.S. patent protection in late 2016.  AbbVie itself raised in 2014 profit forecast on Monday, citing strong recent business performance.

87,ABBV,AbbVie presses case for Shire deal in discreet roadshow,"LONDON (Reuters) - AbbVie (ABBV.N) Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez has pressed the case for his $46 billion pursuit of drugmaker Shire (SHP.L) in discreet meetings with shareholders in London this week and is now weighing his next move, according to people familiar with the matter. Shire shareholders who met with Gonzalez said he had reiterated the case for a deal, arguing that AbbVie would create more value from Shire’s assets than the hyperactivity and rare diseases specialist could do on its own. One person described the meeting he attended as fairly uneventful, with AbbVie giving no indication on the possibility of raising its offer - a move widely expected in order to get the deal done. Gonzalez, who under British takeover rules has until July 18 to make a firm bid for Shire or walk away, has flown back to Chicago for the U.S. long holiday weekend. AbbVie declined to comment on the meetings. Shire has rejected three separate proposals from the U.S. group, arguing the last offer of 46.26 pounds a share in cash and stock fundamentally undervalued the company. While AbbVie has yet to budge on price since Reuters first revealed its bid interest on June 19, it has stated that a deal at 46.26 would lift its earnings “materially” - a comment taken by analysts as a signal that it can afford to pay more. “I’m certainly expecting a revised offer - they are not going to come to the shareholders like this and then disappear,” said Navid Malik, head of life sciences research at Cenkos Securities, who has a 52 pounds target for the shares. Shire shares were 0.8 percent higher at 45.81 pounds by 0825 GMT (4.25 a.m. EDT).   Sources familiar with the situation said Gonzalez was ready to consider bidding more but first wanted to explain his case direct to major Shire shareholders and urge them to put pressure on Shire to engage, while also getting to hear their views on valuation. AbbVie has already made clear it wants to start serious talks with Shire and gain access to its books to get more clarity on sales prospects for certain key drugs, although it has not ruled out going hostile.  In contrast to Pfizer’s (PFE.N) recent high-profile - and  unsuccessful - bid for AstraZeneca (AZN.L), AbbVie’s pursuit of Shire is much more low key, reflecting the U.S. company’s publicity-shy nature and the lack of a big political dimension to the proposed takeover. Gonzalez has eschewed media interviews during his round of meetings with investors this week. “One of the challenges with the Pfizer situation was it was very high profile because of the size of the deal and the large infrastructure AstraZeneca has in the UK,” Malik said. “AbbVie is taking a more discreet approach.” Shire, while founded in Britain, is today managed out of Boston, headquartered in Dublin and has most of its sales in the United States, resulting in a minimal business footprint in Britain. AbbVie is eager to buy Shire, both to reduce taxation by redomiciling in Britain - a tactic known as inversion - and to diversify its drug portfolio.

90,ABBV,AbbVie hikes bid for drugmaker Shire to $51 billion,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker AbbVie (ABBV.N) raised its offer for Shire (SHP.L) to 30.1 billion pounds ($51.3 billion) on Tuesday, hoping to win over its reluctant target after three earlier offers were rejected. The latest 51.15 pounds a share cash-and-stock offer is 11 percent higher than AbbVie’s previous proposal of 46.26 pounds, which the London-listed hyperactivity and rare diseases specialist had said fundamentally undervalued the company. Industry analysts said it was unlikely to be enough to get a deal done. Shire said its board would meet to consider the higher offer, which it added it did not receive before AbbVie announced it to the market. Shares in Shire fell on disappointment the U.S. group had not offered more, or raised the proportion of cash, amid worries that the two sides might not be able to agree a final price. AbbVie also slid, reducing the stock element of its bid. AbbVie is eager to buy Shire both to reduce its tax bill by moving its tax base to Britain - a tactic known as inversion - and to diversify its drug portfolio. The U.S. company currently gets nearly 60 percent of its revenue from rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, the world’s top-selling medicine, which loses U.S. patent protection in late 2016. Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez has pressed the case for his pursuit of Shire in a series of meetings with shareholders on both sides of the Atlantic, after setting out the strategic rationale for a deal on June 25.  AbbVie said it and its financial adviser J.P. Morgan had now met with, or spoken to, Shire investors who represented a majority of Shire’s shares. “I believe they are generally supportive of this transaction and I can tell you that this offer is responsive to the feedback we have received,” Gonzalez told Reuters in a phone interview. He is now urging shareholders to push the Shire board to engage in talks. Industry analysts said the sweetened offer improved AbbVie’s chances of getting Shire into discussions but was unlikely to be enough to clinch a deal. “It gets AbbVie closer to a deal, but I’m not sure it’s quite a knock-out offer,” said Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Purkiss.  “What AbbVie needs is the willingness of Shire to at least engage. I’m not sure this offer in itself is high enough to be absolutely sure of that - it’s possible, but no means certain.” Several analysts have valued Shire in the mid-50s pounds per share or higher. Bernstein said there was a good chance Shire would reject the new offer, while trying to get better terms. Gonzalez refused to be drawn on the possibility of increasing his offer further, but said he was not aware of any rival counterbidders, adding he was not ruling out a hostile move if Shire failed to engage. “We’re going to leave all of our options open and that includes that option as well,” he said. Jefferies analysts said in a note: “If Shire does not begin to indicate a price that will open the books and begin discussions with AbbVie, we suspect there is a possibility that AbbVie goes hostile with a 55 (pounds) offer.”  AbbVie’s move on Shire is the second attempt by a U.S. drugmaker to buy a London-listed rival after Pfizer’s (PFE.N) $118 billion pursuit of AstraZeneca (AZN.L) failed last month - another deal driven in large part by tax savings. Shire shares ended 2.6 percent down on the day at 45.30 pounds following news of the latest offer, which comprises 22.44 in cash and 0.8568 AbbVie shares for each Shire share. AbbVie shares, meanwhile, lost 2.8 percent.  AbbVie said the new offer reflected a substantial sharing of potential synergies between shareholders of each firm, adding Shire shareholders would own 24 percent of the enlarged group. Gonzalez reiterated that it wanted to move quickly to get a deal, arguing it would create more value from Shire’s assets than Shire could do on its own. Under British takeover rules AbbVie has until July 18 to announce a firm offer for Shire or walk away. Shire, while founded in Britain, is today managed out of Boston, headquartered in Dublin and has most of its sales in the United States, resulting in a minimal business footprint in Britain.

Its chief executive, Flemming Ornskov, has said he is happy for the company to be sold at the right price - but he has also laid out a detailed case as to why it worth a lot more than AbbVie was offering. Ornskov has forecast his company’s product sales will double to $10 billion by 2020 as Shire moves into new disease areas. Around 40 percent of Shire’s sales come from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medicines, including Aderall XR and Vyvanse, while the firm also sells pricey drugs to treat rare genetic disorders and is building up a portfolio of treatments in ophthalmology and other specialized areas.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index fell 1.3 percent or 85.06 points to 6,738.45 points. International Consolidated Airlines Group - the owner of British Airways - slumped 7 percent after Air France-KLM’s profit warning, making ICAG the worst-performing FTSE 100 stock in percentage terms. Low-cost airline easyJet also fell 5.8 percent after Air France-KLM warned its 2014 profits could be as much as 12 percent lower than previously predicted because of over-capacity and weak prices. “The profit warning just before the busy summer months for the airlines sector has dampened investors’ sentiment. It’s a confirmation that, generally, the last three months had been difficult for the sector,” said Accendo Markets’ senior trader Tom Robertson. Clothing and food retailer Marks & Spencer fell 1.3 percent after the company reported that first-quarter sales had been held back by its transition to a new website. M&S; kept its full-year profit guidance, but many analysts said the company remained under pressure, with its results on Tuesday showing a 12th consecutive quarterly drop in overall general merchandise sales. “I think M&S; has got its work cut out,” said Beaufort Securities sales trader Basil Petrides, who had sold M&S; shares in the run-up to Tuesday’s business update. Drugmaker Shire also fell 2.6 percent as traders expressed disappointment at rival Abbvie’s latest offer for Shire, with some saying they wanted Abbvie to offer more cash. Traders said a surprise slump in UK factory output in May was also putting pressure on the FTSE. Previous rallies this year have failed to get the FTSE past 6,900 points, which is considered a necessary hurdle to jump before it can move on to record highs. “The UK data certainly has not helped. The FTSE just continues to underwhelm”, said Hantec Markets analyst Richard Perry.

97,ABBV,UPDATE 2-AbbVie forced to retract claims of Shire investor support,"* AbbVie retracts claim that Shire investors support bid * UK rules require written statements to make such claims * Shire considering raised $51 bln offer, yet to respond   (Adds further detail on advisers, latest shares, Breakingviews link) By Ben Hirschler LONDON, July 9 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker AbbVie  has been forced to retract comments by its chief executive about shareholder support for its $51 billion bid for Shire  after being caught out by British takeover rules. Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday he believed major Shire investors were  “generally supportive of this transaction” - a comment he repeated in conversations with other media. Under Takeover Panel rules, designed to ensure fair treatment for all investors, a company attempting to acquire a rival is not allowed to claim support for its bid unless it has this in writing from shareholders. “AbbVie confirms that it has not received any written commitments of support and accordingly retracts the statements,” it said on Wednesday. The error is a further example of the strict nature of British takeover rules, which also caused problems for Pfizer  during its unsuccessful bid for AstraZeneca  earlier this year. The retraction is embarrassing for AbbVie and its key advisers - investment bank J.P. Morgan and public relations firm Brunswick, both of which also advised Pfizer. Pfizer limited its options and caused some market confusion when it declared its $118 billion offer for AstraZeneca “final”. AbbVie’s climbdown is further evidence of how closely the Takeover Panel is monitoring bid situations. The watchdog also forced U.S. medical devices firm Stryker to announce in May it did not intend to make an offer for Smith & Nephew  following a report it was considering a bid. AbbVie raised its offer for Shire to 30.1 billion pounds ($51.3 billion) on Tuesday, hoping to win over its reluctant target after three earlier offers were rejected. Shire has yet to respond to the latest cash-and-stock offer, which was worth 51.15 pounds a share at July 7 prices, or 11 percent more than AbbVie’s previous proposal. It said on Tuesday that its board was meeting to consider it. Industry analysts said it was unlikely to be enough to get a deal done but it could bring Shire to the negotiating table. Several analysts have valued Shire in the mid-50s pounds per share or higher. However, with AbbVie’s shares falling 3 percent on Tuesday, the actual value of the latest offer has fallen to 50.19 pounds per share, which Panmure Gordon analyst Savvas Neophytou said was inadequate and was likely to be rejected by the Shire board. Other analysts said Shire’s board might try to seek alternative offers in order to push the price higher, although AbbVie’s Gonzalez told Reuters he was not aware of any counterbidders interested in the company. Shire shares were down 1.3 percent at 44.70 pounds by 1120 GMT. The silence from the Shire camp and the failure by AbbVie to land a decisive blow has prompted some hedge funds to take profits, according to people close to the situation. Worries that the two sides may not manage to reach a deal, as happened with Pfizer-AstraZeneca, has fuelled volatility in Shire shares, which fell back sharply on Tuesday after initially rising on news of the raised bid. AbbVie may have some room to offer more but is likely to be constrained by a desire to maintain its investment grade credit rating. The U.S. company is eager to buy Shire both to reduce its tax bill by moving its tax base to Britain - a tactic known as inversion - and to diversify its drug portfolio by adding Shire’s specialised drugs for hyperactivity and rare diseases. Moody’s Investors Service said the latest increased offer was credit negative as it would raise AbbVie’s financial leverage, with its ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) expected to reach a range of 3.2 to 3.6 times, compared to 2.2 times at the end of March.

Shire, in a release, said it would provide a further update “when appropriate.” It added there can be no certainty that any firm offer will be made nor as to the terms of any such offer. The meeting, between Shire Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov and AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez, took place Thursday in New York, according to a source familiar with the matter. AbbVie, which is based in suburban Chicago and makes top-selling arthritis drug Humira and other medicines, has offered $51 billion for Shire, hoping the deal would cut its tax bill and diversify its product line. But Shire has rejected three previous proposals from AbbVie, saying they had fundamentally undervalued the company. Some top investors in Shire have been urging it to engage with AbbVie, after a prolonged silence from the London-listed drugmaker. Shire is a serial acquirer, having done six deals since Ornskov took the helm of Shire 14 months ago. It bought rare disease specialist Viropharma for $4.2 billion last November in its biggest deal yet - and Ornskov has said further “large” deals were possible. Drugs for rare diseases are highly lucrative, often commanding prices of hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index closed up by 0.3 percent, or 17.80 points, at 6,690.17 points. Shire surged 5.9 percent on new signs that the company may have to engage with rival AbbVie to discuss the U.S drugmaker’s $51 billion takeover bid for Shire. Merger activity also lifted Imperial Tobacco and British American Tobacco, after Imperial said it was in talks to buy some brands from Reynolds and Lorillard  as part of a merger plan confirmed by the two U.S. companies. Over the course of the week, the FTSE fell by 2.6 percent, its biggest weekly drop since April. Financial markets have been unsettled this week by problems with Portuguese bank Banco Espirito Santo, and IPR Capital director Steven Mayne backed selling or “shorting” any advances by the FTSE 100. “Political and economic unrest could quickly move the market lower, so I would look to short any rallies,” said Mayne. The FTSE’s retreat since the start of July has pushed it down from peaks reached in late May, which took the index close to record highs. Some traders expect it to remain stuck in its recent trading range, between a high just below 6,900 points and lows around 6,600, through the next month. “I still think that 6,900 is achievable by the year end, but for the moment, it’s a bit risk-off,” said Novum Securities’ technical strategist Adrian Slack.

103,ABBV,"CORRECTED-As Shire stays silent, some investors urge talks with AbbVie","(Corrects day of week in second paragraph) * Top-five shareholder urges Shire to talk to AbbVie * Other investors write to Shire board pushing case for deal * Shire yet to respond to AbbVie’s latest $51 bln offer By Anjuli Davies and Ben Hirschler LONDON, July 11 (Reuters) - Some top investors in Shire  are urging it to engage with AbbVie to discuss the U.S. drugmaker’s $51 billion takeover bid as a prolonged silence from the London-listed drugmaker adds to uncertainty over a possible deal. AbbVie, which wants to buy Shire to cut its tax bill and diversify its product line-up, raised its cash-and-stock offer for Shire to 51.15 pounds a share on Tuesday, though this value has since fallen to around 50 as AbbVie shares have slipped. “Based on the new bid, we think Shire should engage,” one top-five Shire shareholder told Reuters on Friday. Shire shares were 1.2 percent up on the day at 46.55 pounds by 1415 GMT. Other Shire shareholders have also written to the company’s board expressing their support for a deal and have called on Chairwoman Susan Kilsby to open talks with AbbVie’s Chairman and CEO Richard Gonzalez, several people with direct knowledge of the situation said. They argue that 51 pounds is a good enough number for Shire to allow for due diligence, so that the two sides can negotiate a final deal price. But after rejecting three previous proposals from AbbVie, which it said fundamentally undervalued the company, Shire has still not responded publicly to the latest offer. Industry sources said the hyperactivity and rare diseases specialist was in constant communication with its shareholders and was weighing their feedback, but it remained unclear which path the Shire board would take. A number of investors said they believed a deal could be hammered out in a relatively short time - perhaps even over the coming weekend - given Shire has said it is happy for the company to be sold at the right price. But it is also possible that Shire could yet come out with a strongly worded rejection next week, which would give AbbVie little time to recover. Under British takeover rules AbbVie has until July 18 to announce a firm offer for Shire or walk away for up to six months. Officials at Shire and AbbVie declined to comment. Shire was founded in Britain but is today managed out of Boston, headquartered in Dublin and generates most of its sales in the United States. Buying Shire would allow AbbVie to join a growing number of companies to move their tax base out of the United States and would give it an effective tax rate of around 13 percent by 2016, against 22 percent last year. Shire has made a strong case for independence, arguing that its product sales will double to $10 billion by 2020 as it moves into new disease areas. But many shareholders would rather get rewarded today and are nervous that a deal might slip through their fingers - as happened in May when Pfizer failed in its $118 billion pursuit of AstraZeneca. AbbVie has also been actively lobbying Shire investors to get their support. The U.S. group said on July 8 that it and its financial adviser J.P. Morgan had met with, or spoken to, investors representing a majority of Shire’s shares. Gonzalez went on to claim that major Shire investors were “generally supportive of this transaction” but was forced to retract this comment under strict British takeover rules because he did not give evidence of such support in writing.

104,ABBV,Shire seeks AbbVie bid of close to 53 pounds per share: sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shire Plc (SHP.L) is seeking a higher takeover offer from U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) that would value the company at about 31 billion pounds ($53 billion), according to people familiar with the matter. Shire, which on Friday confirmed it has met with AbbVie to discuss a takeover, had asked AbbVie to sweeten its offer to close to 53 pounds per share in order to get blessing from the Dublin-based maker of drugs for rare diseases, the people said. Shire’s asking price is not far above AbbVie’s latest 51.15 pounds per share bid and the relative small valuation gap suggests the two sides may be getting closer to agreeing on a deal. Under British takeover rules AbbVie has until July 18 to announce a firm offer for Shire or walk away. Representatives for Shire and AbbVie did not respond on Saturday to requests for comment. The sources asked not to be named because the discussions are private.

AbbVie is eager to buy Shire both to reduce its U.S. tax bill by moving its tax base to Britain - a tactic known as inversion - and to diversify its drug portfolio. AbbVie  currently gets nearly 60 percent of its revenue from rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, the world’s top-selling medicine, which loses U.S. patent protection in late 2016. In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, AbbVie Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez refused to be drawn on the possibility of increasing his offer, but said he was leaving all options open. AbbVie’s move on Shire is the second attempt by a U.S. drugmaker to buy a London-listed rival after Pfizer’s $118 billion pursuit of AstraZeneca failed last month over price. That deal was also driven in large part by tax savings. Gonzalez met with Flemming Ornskov, his counterpart at Shire, on Thursday in New York, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.

Boosting investors’ confidence that the market is still attractive to invest, Shire Plc, which sells drugs for rare diseases, succumbed to an increased 31 billion pound ($53 billion) takeover offer from Abbvie Inc on Monday. U.S.-listed shares of Shire rose 2.2 percent to $254.63 while Abbvie shares fell 0.5 percent to $54.71. Generic drugmaker Mylan Inc said it would buy Abbott Laboratories’ specialty and branded generics business outside the United States in an all-stock transaction valued at about $5.3 billion. Mylan shares advanced 2.2 percent to $51.30 while Abbott shares rose 0.8 percent to $41.62. Citigroup Inc shares rose 3.2 percent to $48.49 as one of the top boosts to the S&P; 500 after it posted second-quarter earnings and agreed to pay $7 billion to settle a U.S. government investigation into mortgage-backed securities. The S&P; financial index gained 0.6 percent. Citigroup is the first major commercial bank to report, and with today’s earnings, the trend seems to be pointing that financials will have a good earnings season, said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. Goldman Sachs analyst David Kostin raised his 2014 target for the S&P; 500 to 2,050 from 1,900, citing expectations that yields on the 10-year Treasury note around 3 percent will continue to push investors into stocks for higher returns. Earnings season will pick up speed this week, with 59 S&P; 500 components scheduled to report.

109,ABBV,Shire ready to bow to AbbVie's increased $53 billion offer,"LONDON (Reuters) - London-listed drugmaker Shire Plc (SHP.L) succumbed to an increased 31 billion pounds ($53 billion) takeover offer from Abbvie Inc ABBN.N on Monday, signaling the conclusion to a long-running courtship largely motivated by tax.  Shire said it was ready to recommend the deal, the latest in a list of mergers proposed by U.S. firms seeking to cut their tax rates, and which comes less than seven weeks after the collapse of Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) $118 billion bid for AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), also motivated in part by tax factors. Chicago-based AbbVie, which wants to buy Shire to cut its tax bill and diversify its product line-up, increased its offer to 53.20 pounds per share on Sunday, following a request from the Dublin-based group which had rejected four previous bids.  Citing people familiar with the matter, Reuters had reported on Saturday that Shire, a maker of drugs for rare diseases, had asked AbbVie to sweeten its offer to near 53 pounds per share in order for it to recommend the deal.  Shire said the new bid comprised 24.44 pounds in cash and 0.8960 new AbbVie shares for each Shire share and would result in Shire investors owning around 25 percent of the combined entity.  “The proposed offer seems a fair price that represents good value for both companies’ shareholders,” said Mick Cooper, an analyst at Edison Investment Research. Shares in Shire, founded in 1986, hit a record high of 50.45 pounds in mid-morning trading. AbbVie is eager to buy Shire both to reduce its U.S. tax bill by moving its tax base to Britain - a tactic known as inversion - and to diversify its drug portfolio.  The U.S. group gets nearly 60 percent of its revenue from rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, the world’s top-selling medicine, which loses U.S. patent protection in late 2016. Analysts at Barclays estimated the move would provide an estimated $1.3 billion tax savings by 2020, reflecting lower UK corporate tax rates. AbbVie has proposed creating a new U.S.-listed holding company with a tax domicile in Britain, whose corporate tax rate is set to drop as low as 20 percent from 2015, well below the U.S. headline rate of 35 percent plus local taxes. The UK government has also introduced tax breaks designed to encourage research and development. “We expect the majority of the tax savings to be realized within the first two years,” Barclays analysts said.  “Strategically AbbVie acquires Shire’s quality growth assets in platforms including rare diseases, neuroscience and ophthalmology, easing investor concerns about over-reliance on Humira and offering future growth opportunities.” Analyst Alistair Campbell at banking group Berenberg said there were few other British pharmaceutical companies that would suit a tax inversion takeover.  “The company has to be of a certain size, because around 20 percent of the shareholders post deal must be shareholders in the target company, so you can’t go for small companies,” he said. “Glaxo (GSK.L) is too big, Astra has had an approach from Pfizer and Shire has now gone.”  Smith & Nephew Plc (SN.L), Europe’s largest maker of artificial joints, has been seen as a possible contender, with U.S.-based Stryker Corp (SYK.N) forced to say it would not bid for the group after reports linking it with a deal circulated in May.  Sweden’s Meda AB MEDAa.ST rejected an improved takeover offer from U.S. generics firm Mylan Inc (MYL.O) in April, which could have helped reduce taxes.  The approach for Shire, founded in Britain, has been far less controversial than the move for AstraZeneca. Headquartered in Dublin, it is managed from Boston, Massachusetts, and has most of its sales in the United States, resulting in a relatively small business footprint in Britain. Shire Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov had said he was happy for the company to be sold at the right price, but like AstraZeneca in its defense against Pfizer, he had set out a detailed case as to why it was worth a lot more than AbbVie was originally offering.

Dublin-based Shire said it would recommend the deal, the latest in a list of mergers proposed by U.S. companies seeking to cut tax rates. It comes less than seven weeks after the collapse of Pfizer Inc’s $118 billion bid for AstraZeneca Plc, also motivated in part by tax factors.

Shire said the new bid comprised 24.44 pounds in cash and 0.8960 new AbbVie share for each Shire share, giving Shire investors about 25 percent ownership of the combined entity. “This deal makes a lot of sense for AbbVie as it would lower its tax rate from 22 percent to 13 percent, reduce dependence on Humira, broaden the (drug) pipeline, and provide some opportunities for operational synergies,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said in a research note. AbbVie gets nearly 60 percent of its revenue from rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, the world’s top-selling medicine, which loses U.S. patent protection in late 2016. BMO is estimating the combination would increase AbbVie’s earnings per share by 9 percent in 2015 and 17 percent in 2016. AbbVie shares were down 1.4 percent at $54.19 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Shire was up 1.6 percent in London after earlier hitting an all-time high of 50.45 pounds. AbbVie would lower its corporate tax rate by moving its tax base to Britain, a tactic known as inversion. Analysts at Barclays estimated the move would provide an estimated $1.3 billion in tax savings by 2020. “Strategically, AbbVie acquires Shire’s quality growth assets in platforms including rare diseases, neuroscience and ophthalmology, easing investor concerns about overreliance on Humira and offering future growth opportunities,” Barclays said.

120,ABBV,U.S. drugmaker AbbVie finally wins Dublin's Shire with $55 billion deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc bought Dublin-based Shire Plc on Friday in a 32 billion pound ($54.7 billion) deal that will allow it to slash its tax bill by relocating to Britain. The London-listed company, which makes expensive medicines to treat rare diseases, fought off four earlier bids from AbbVie until the U.S. firm raised its price to 52.48 pounds per share - made up of 24.44 pounds in cash and 0.8960 new AbbVie shares. Chicago-based AbbVie is buying Shire to cut both its U.S. tax bill and its reliance on arthritis drug Humira, the world’s top selling medicine which loses U.S. patent protection in 2016. AbbVie, which generates nearly 60 percent of its revenue from Humira, had until Friday to announce a firm offer for Shire, extend the deadline or walk away under UK takeover rules. It now plans to create a company listed in New York, incorporated in Jersey, the Channel Islands, and tax-domiciled in Britain, which will pay an effective tax of about 13 percent by 2016, sharply lower than its current rate of about 22 percent, making the deal one of the biggest driven by the tactic known as tax inversion. America’s Pfizer Inc tried to pull off the same trick earlier this year when it made a bid for Britain’s AstraZeneca plc though its $118 billion deal was rejected. Calls for political action to stop tax inversion deals are growing in the United States. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew urged Congress this week to take steps to discourage companies moving their tax domiciles aboard, saying “economic patriotism” was needed. AbbVie’s chairman and chief executive Richard Gonzalez said he thought the debate would be more appropriately shifted to tax reform and making companies more competitive in the global economy. U.S. companies cannot move overseas earnings back into the country for acquisitions or investment without losing part of it to the taxman. “Companies like ours need access to our global cash flows to be able to make investments all around the world, but specifically to be able to make investments in the United States, and today we at a disadvantage versus many of our foreign competitors,” he said. However, he added, tax cutting was not the main objective of the Shire deal. “It’s not the primary rationale for this,” he told analysts on a conference call, explaining that the combined group would have leadership positions in immunology, rare diseases, neuroscience, and metabolic and liver diseases, as well as a best-in-class product development platform, a stronger pipeline and better R&D; capabilities. The merged group will also have more firepower for acquisitions, he said, particularly to bolster the rare disease business, the foundations of which were built on acquisitions by Shire. Shire’s board had said on Monday it was ready to recommend the higher offer from AbbVie, signaling the end of a lengthy courtship. AbbVie’s agreed price represents a premium of about 53 percent to Shire’s share price on May 2, the last business day before AbbVie’s first offer, which was rebuffed by Shire. Shares in Shire, which will own about 25 percent of the combined group, closed 3.9 percent higher at 49.96 pounds, while AbbVie was up 2.1 percent to $54.65 at 1615 GMT. Gonzalez said Shire Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov, whose tenure at the drugmaker was marked by earnings upgrade after earnings upgrade, would stay on, initially to help with integration and then to head a dedicated rare disease division.

121,ABBV,Shire and ITV lead late rally for UK's FTSE,"* FTSE 100 closes up 0.2 pct at 6,749.45 points * Shire rises after agreeing takeover by Abbvie * ITV also up on bid speculation * Shooting-down of airliner weighs on sentiment By Sudip Kar-Gupta LONDON, July 18 (Reuters) - Drugmaker Shire and TV group ITV nudged up Britain’s stock market, enabling it to recover from earlier losses caused by concerns about Ukraine, after an airliner was shot down in the violence-ridden region. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index, which had been in negative territory for much of the day, staged a late rally to close up by 0.2 percent, or 11.13 points, at 6,749.45 points on Friday. Global stock markets had slumped on Thursday after the shooting-down over eastern Ukraine of a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 with 298 people on board. World leaders demanded an international investigation into the plane crash, which could mark a turning point in the worst crisis between Russia and the West since the Cold War if it convinces reluctant Europeans to get behind tougher sanctions on Russia long sought by the United States. However, a rally in Shire enabled the FTSE 100 to come off its earlier intraday lows. Shire rose nearly 4 percent, adding the most points to the FTSE, after U.S. rival Abbvie  agreed a $55 billion deal to take it over. Merger speculation also lifted ITV by 3.8 percent, after cable group Liberty Global’s decision to buy BSkyB’s  6.4 percent stake in ITV boosted prospects of a wider bid. In spite of the worries about the Ukraine conflict, some traders have said that corporate takeover activity, and the fact that equities offer better returns than bonds or cash, should enable stock markets to rally into the end of 2014. “The geopolitical situation is quite jittery at the moment, but everybody is looking at the dip as a buying opportunity,” said Novum Securities’ technical analyst Adrian Slack. Others, however, were more circumspect. “We were buying the dips up until the plane crash. We are now a bit cautious and will not be taking new positions going into the weekend,” said Mark Ward, head of trading at Sanlam Securities.

122,ABBV,AbbVie’s Shire merger backed with 13.5 billion pound bridge loan,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker AbbVie’s (ABBV.N) 32 billion pounds acquisition of Dublin-based Shire Plc (SHP.L) is backed with a 13.5 billion pounds ($23.03 billion) bridge loan, according to the company’s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US.  JP Morgan is the sole arranger and underwriter of the bridge loan, which is expected to be refinanced with up to 15.5 billion pounds of senior unsecured bonds that AbbVie is planning to issue to cover the cash element of the acquisition. AbbVie bought Shire on Friday in a $54.7 billion deal that will allow it to slash its tax bill by relocating to Britain.  The bridge loan comprises a loan of up to 9.1 billion pounds with a 364-day maturity, a 3.2 billion pounds loan with a 364-day maturity, and a 1.2 billion pounds facility with a maturity of 60 days.  The financing pays an interest margin of 62.5 basis points (bps) to 150bps over Libor, depending on rating of the merged company after the acquisition.  There is also an initial commitment fee of 10bps on undrawn amounts, which can ratchet in a range from 6bps to 17.5bps, depending on the company’s public debt rating after the acquisition.

128,ABBV,AbbVie profit beats estimates on surging Humira sales,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc, which last week announced plans to buy Dublin-based drugmaker Shire Plc for $55 billion, reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings on surging sales of its Humira treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Second-quarter sales rose 5 percent to $4.93 billion, topping Wall Street expectations of $4.7 billion. The gains were mostly due to Humira, an injectable treatment whose global sales jumped 26 percent to $3.29 billion, AbbVie said on Friday. Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said Humira sales were $350 million above expectations, and he affirmed his rating of AbbVie as the top global pick in the pharmaceutical industry.   “The scale of the Humira beat will surprise all,” Holford said. But he noted that numerous other AbbVie products fell short in the quarter, including the Androgel testosterone drug, Kaletra medicine for HIV, and Lupron treatment for prostate cancer. Humira, the world’s top-selling drug, now accounts for 67 percent of AbbVie’s sales. Reliance on the medicine by the suburban Chicago company is a main reason it sought out Shire, which has an array of lucrative treatments for rare diseases. After buying Shire, AbbVie plans to locate the combined company in Britain, where taxes are lower. The maneuver, called tax inversion, is being used by many U.S. companies, especially drugmakers, and has come under fire from President Barack Obama and some members of Congress.  Humira sales were especially strong in the United States, where they rose 36 percent, helped by retail buying patterns. But Humira will take a breather in the third quarter, AbbVie predicted, with its U.S. sales growth tapering to the “high teens” percentage range. Humira, approved in 2002 to treat rheumatoid arthritis, is also used to treat other inflammatory conditions. Although Humira’s U.S. patent lapses in late 2016, AbbVie has said it will take years for other drugmakers to develop and win approval for their own versions. Besides buying Shire, AbbVie is trying to lessen its dependence on Humira by attempting to develop treatments for hepatitis C, cancer and other diseases. AbbVie said it had earned $1.1 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the second quarter, compared with $1.07 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding writedowns and other special items, AbbVie earned 82 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 76 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The company’s effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.2 percent. AbbVie said it expects its tax rate to drop to the 13 percent range by 2016, after its completes its acquisition of Shire. AbbVie said it still expected full-year earnings of $3.06 to $3.16 per share, excluding special items.

AbbVie and Calico said on Wednesday the initial funding would help Calico use its scientific expertise to create research facilities in the San Francisco Bay area. Each partner could ultimately invest an additional $500 million in the collaboration. “Calico expects to begin filling critical positions immediately and plans to establish a substantial team of scientists and research staff in the San Francisco Bay area,” the companies said in a joint release.  A year ago Google announced it was creating Calico, to be headed by Art Levinson, the former chief executive officer and guiding force behind Genentech, a cancer company considered by many to be the most successful biotechnology company in history. Levinson left after Genentech was bought by Roche Holding AG ROG.VX. Calico is run separately from Google, the world’s largest Internet search company, and focuses on such issues as life-threatening diseases and problems affecting mental and physical agility due to aging. Google increasingly is placing itself at the intersection of medical science and technology. It also backs privately held 23andMe, which sells a $99 DNA test that provides customers ancestry-related genetic reports and uninterpreted raw genetic data. AbbVie said it was the first drugmaker to forge a collaboration with Calico. Under the deal, AbbVie will provide scientific and clinical development support and commercial expertise. The partners will share costs equally, and profits, if drugs are successfully developed. Calico will be responsible for discovering drugs and studying them in early stage trials during the first five years. It will continue for a 10-year period to advance its experimental drugs through Phase 2a studies, small mid-stage trials that establish a likelihood the drugs may work in larger studies. Under the deal, AbbVie will back Calico’s early research and, following completion of Phase 2a studies, will have the option to manage late-stage trials and marketing. AbbVie was spun off in early 2013 from Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N), and sells Humira, a $13 billion-a-year treatment for rheumatoid arthritis which is the world’s top-selling  medicine. Humira accounts for 60 percent of AbbVie sales, and the suburban Chicago company needs new drugs to lessen its heavy reliance on the product. It is developing drugs for arthritis, hepatitis C, cancer, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease.  AbbVie in July agreed to pay $55 billion for Dublin-based Shire Plc (SHP.L), moving it into the lucrative arena of rare diseases, in a deal that will allow it to slash its tax bill by relocating to Britain.  Richard Gonzalez, AbbVie’s chief executive, on Wednesday said the Calico deal will further diversify his company. “This collaboration demonstrates our commitment to exploring new areas of medicine.”   Calico is attracting a growing stable of research heavy-hitters, including Hal Barron, a former chief medical officer and head of product development at Roche who is now Calico’s research chief.

The move comes a day after Calico partnered with Roche’s  rival AbbVie Inc to invest in new research operations for age-related diseases. Levinson, 64, is a former chief executive and guiding force behind Genentech, a cancer company considered by many to be the most successful biotechnology company in history. He stepped down as CEO after Roche bought out the remaining stake it did not already own in the U.S. group for $47 billion in 2009, but became a board member at the Swiss drugmaker. Fabian Wenner, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux in Zurich said it was a shame Roche had not been able to keep hold of a person with extensive sector experience and a strong track record. “Apart from Art, there’s only one board member now with sector experience which is quite a loss for Roche in my view,” he said. “The fact the Calico partnered with AbbVie and not with Roche is not a good indicator.” Levinson, who is also chairman of Apple, has a high-calibre network and has already poached several heavy-hitters to join Google’s nascent biotech company, including Hal Barron, Roche’s former chief medical officer, who joined Calico last year. “We regret Art’s decision but at the same time understand his reasons,” said Roche Chairman Christoph Franz in a statement. Levinson was passed over for the role of Roche chairman in favour of Franz, a former CEO of German airline Lufthansa  who took up the job in March.

136,ABBV,"AbbVie, Teva broke law in AndroGel 'pay for delay' deal, U.S. says","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Monday sued Drugmakers AbbVie Inc and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd for allegedly illegally preventing generic versions of AndroGel, for men with low testosterone, from getting to market.  The FTC, which says AndroGel users paid hundreds of millions of dollars more than necessary because of the companies’ actions, asked the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to order AbbVie to refund users that money. This case is the second the FTC has filed focused on AndroGel, AbbVie’s second-highest-selling product, with sales of $472 million in the first half of 2014, according to a company filing with the government. In the latest case, the FTC accused AbbVie of filing “baseless” patent infringement lawsuits against Israeli firm Teva and a second company to stop them from selling generic AndroGel. AbbVie then reached an agreement with Teva in which Teva agreed to refrain from bringing out a cheaper version of AndroGel in exchange for winning AbbVie’s permission to sell an authorized generic of the cholesterol drug Tricor. AbbVie declined to comment on the lawsuit filed on Monday. But the company said in an email that “our patent infringement lawsuits were appropriate and our settlement agreements were lawful, as well as in the best interest of all parties.”  This case is one of several the agency has filed aimed at stopping the practice of branded drug companies compensating generic companies for not bringing out cheaper copies of drugs.

137,ABBV,"UPDATE 2-AbbVie, Teva broke law in AndroGel ""pay for delay"" deal, U.S. says","(Adds AbbVie comment; court; background on the dispute) By Diane Bartz WASHINGTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Monday sued Drugmakers AbbVie Inc and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd for allegedly illegally preventing generic versions of AndroGel, for men with low testosterone, from getting to market. The FTC, which says AndroGel users paid hundreds of millions of dollars more than necessary because of the companies’ actions, asked the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to order AbbVie to refund users that money. This case is the second the FTC has filed focused on AndroGel, AbbVie’s second-highest-selling product, with sales of $472 million in the first half of 2014, according to a company filing with the government. In the latest case, the FTC accused AbbVie of filing “baseless” patent infringement lawsuits against Israeli firm Teva and a second company to stop them from selling generic AndroGel. AbbVie then reached an agreement with Teva in which Teva agreed to refrain from bringing out a cheaper version of AndroGel in exchange for winning AbbVie’s permission to sell an authorized generic of the cholesterol drug Tricor. AbbVie declined to comment on the lawsuit filed on Monday. But the company said in an email that “our patent infringement lawsuits were appropriate and our settlement agreements were lawful, as well as in the best interest of all parties.” This case is one of several the agency has filed aimed at stopping the practice of branded drug companies compensating generic companies for not bringing out cheaper copies of drugs.

141,ABBV,"REPEAT-UPDATE 2-AstraZeneca, Shire dive as U.S. tax move punctures deal hopes","(Adds links to Breaking Views commentary) * U.S. moves against tax-avoidance “inversion” deals * May deter Pfizer from returning to bid for AstraZeneca * Seen as possible threat to Shire’s agreed sale to AbbVie * Smith & Nephew, Actelion also down on fading bid hopes   (Adds further analyst comments, more on other deals) By Ben Hirschler LONDON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Shares in drugmakers AstraZeneca  and Shire fell sharply on Tuesday after the U.S. Treasury took steps to curb “inversion” deals that allow companies to escape high U.S. taxes by reincorporating abroad. The move could jeopardise an agreed deal for AbbVie  to buy Shire for $55 billion and deter Pfizer from making another attempt to acquire AstraZeneca, after a $118 billion takeover attempt failed in May. The slide in both companies shares wiped out around $8 billion in their combined market value, with AstraZeneca down 5.0 percent and Shire losing 6.1 percent by 1115 GMT. AbbVie lost 4.6 percent in pre-market U.S. dealings. Smith & Nephew and Swiss biotech group Actelion , two other perennial targets of bid speculation, fell 3.5 percent and 2.2 percent respectively. Investors had been expecting some action from the Obama administration to clamp down on tax-avoidance inversions but the steps announced on Monday were more far-reaching than anticipated, analysts at Deutsche Bank said. The new rules, effective immediately, will make new inversions more difficult to do and less potentially rewarding - but whether that will be enough to scupper deals that are pending or under consideration is not clear. The action follows months of political debate, with Democrats urging prompt legislative action and Republicans pushing to address the problem later, perhaps in 2015, as part of a broader overhaul of the loophole-riddled federal tax code. “Inversion deals now are clearly going to be very difficult to pull off,” Navid Malik, head of life sciences research at Cenkos Securities, said. That could kill off prospects of Pfizer returning to bid for AstraZeneca at the end of November, when a six-month cooling-off period imposed by British takeover rules comes to an end and the U.S. group can publicly launch a new offer, Malik said. Other analysts were less certain. Andrew Baum of Citi said the Treasury move would have a limited impact on the economic case for a Pfizer-AstraZeneca deal - though the threat of additional measures could give the U.S. group pause - and he still expects Pfizer to return after the Nov. 26 deadline. Both Pfizer and AstraZeneca are bound by rules that mean they cannot comment on deal prospects. However, the British firm said previously that the controversial tax issue was a big risk for investors that could cause major delays to any transaction. The Shire deal may still go ahead, since it is already in train, although AbbVie will likely lose upside from planned tax savings, making the picture uncertain. The transaction is due to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. “Shire has enough momentum in its business and a good enough pipeline that it would be attractive to AbbVie anyway,” Malik said. “The tax inversion was the icing on the cake.” Shire and AbbVie officials did not have any immediate comment on the latest developments. Inversions have surged in the past year, pursued by healthcare companies in particular, although fast-food chain Burger King Worldwide is also in the midst of inverting to Canada in a deal with Tim Hortons. Medical technology group Medtronic, meanwhile, is working to close an inversion deal into Ireland with rival Covidien, while Mylan plans to buy certain Abbott Laboratories’ drugs in developed markets outside the United States in another tax-cutting transaction. About 50 such deals have taken place since the early 1980s, but the pace has picked up, with half of those completed since the 2008-2009 credit crisis, according to a Reuters review. A key target of Treasury’s actions is foreign profits held offshore by U.S. multinationals under a U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rule that defers taxation on such profits unless and until they are brought into the United States. One new Treasury rule will prevent inverted companies from using “hopscotch” loans that allow them to avoid dividend taxes when tapping such tax-deferred foreign profits. Another rule will bar inverters from gaining access to the same kinds of profits by using “decontrolling” strategies that restructure foreign units so they are no longer U.S.-controlled. Treasury is also tightening limits on the levels of ownership that the former U.S. owners can have in an inverted company to qualify for foreign tax treatment from the IRS, a move that will make it harder to do these deals.

The company was also accused of promoting the drug for unapproved uses and of making other false claims not supported by data, such as that Adderall XR would prevent poor academic performance, loss of employment, criminal behavior, traffic accidents, and sexually transmitted disease.

149,ABBV,UPDATE 1-Amgen's Humira copy succeeds in skin disease trial,"(Adds analyst comment, background; updates shares) Oct 8 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc said its copycat version of AbbVie Inc’s blockbuster biotech drug Humira showed comparable safety and ability to generate immune response in patients with a type of skin disease. The drug, ABP 501, was being tested in a late-stage trial in patients with plaque psoriasis, a skin disease caused by dysfunction of the immune system and which leads to painful, itchy red patches. Humira, a rheumatoid arthritis injection, is also approved for a number of other inflammatory diseases including plaque psoriasis. The drug, whose patents will start expiring in December 2016, generated sales of $10.66 billion in 2013. “We remain bullish about AMGN’s biosimilar prospects given the manufacturing expertise which would likely be key for success in biosimilar competition,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note, pegging the future value of Amgen’s biosimilar business at $18 per share with a 100 percent probability. Amgen has six biosimilar molecules in development and expects to launch the portfolio starting in 2017. The trial met the main goal, with patients showing improvement based on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, a measure of the average redness, thickness and scaliness of the lesions at week 16, Amgen said. This is the first of the two late-stage trials which will support the company’s regulatory applications for the drug. Drug makers are currently chasing an emerging market for cheaper copies of costly biotech drugs, with more than 700 so-called biosimilars now in development or already approved, according to a major study of the sector published in September. Major companies involved in the emerging biosimilars sector include Novartis AG’s Sandoz unit and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and Pfizer Inc.

151,ABBV,Amgen psoriasis drug succeeds late-stage trial,"Oct 8 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc said its experimental drug to treat a type of skin disease compared favorably with AbbVie Inc’s Humira, a commonly prescribed drug for the condition, in a late-stage trial. The drug, ABP 501, was being tested in patients with plaque psoriasis, a skin disease caused by dysfunction of the immune system that leads to painful, itchy red patches. The trial met the main goal, with patients showing improvement based on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, a measure of the average redness, thickness and scaliness of the lesions at week 16, the company said. ABP 501 is being developed as a biosimilar to Humira, which is approved in many countries for the treatment of inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis and Crohn’s disease. Biosimilar medicines are copies of biotech drugs that promise to cut the cost of treatment. Amgen’s shares were marginally higher at $136.59 in early trading on the Nasdaq on Wednesday.

153,ABBV,UPDATE 6-AbbVie cools on $55 bln Shire deal after U.S. tax changes,"* AbbVie says it is reconsidering backing for deal * Shire shares down 23 percent * AbbVie board to meet on Oct. 20 * Deal was partly motivated by tax benefits * Shire urges AbbVie to stick to original plan   (Adds analyst comment, Shire waiving 3-day notification, adds NEW YORK to dateline) By Paul Sandle and Ransdell Pierson LONDON/NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - U.S. pharmaceutical company AbbVie said it was reconsidering its $55 billion takeover of Shire in the wake of U.S. government moves to curb deals designed to cut taxes, wiping as much as $13 billion off the London-listed firm’s stock price. Chicago-based AbbVie said late on Tuesday it was responding to the U.S. proposals which aim to make it harder for American firms to shift their tax bases out of the country and into lower cost jurisdictions in Europe. AbbVie’s move for Shire, a leader in drugs to treat attention deficit disorder and rare diseases, was announced in July amid a spate of similar takeover deals in the pharmaceutical sector. It proposed creating a new U.S.-listed holding company with a tax domicile in Britain, which applies low tax rates to patent income and has passed laws that make it easy for companies to shift profits into tax havens. The news hammered shares in Shire, sending them down 23 percent, to where they were before the deal talks emerged in June. Shares in larger rival AstraZeneca, which had rebuffed a $118 billion takeover bid from U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc, fell 2.9 percent. AbbVie said its board will meet on Monday to consider the impact of the U.S. Department of Treasury’s proposed unilateral changes to tax regulations announced last month, and to also consider whether to withdraw or modify its recommendation on the Shire deal. Shire urged AbbVie to push ahead, pointing out that the U.S. drugmaker might have to pay a breakup fee of $1.64 billion were it to renege on its recommendation for the deal to shareholders. “The board of Shire believes that AbbVie should proceed with the recommended offer on the agreed terms,” Shire said in a statement. And the British drugmaker waived a requirement that AbbVie give it three business days’ notice before holding the board meeting. AbbVie’s second thoughts on the deal surprised Shire investors, coming just weeks after AbbVie chief executive Richard Gonzalez, in the wake of the Treasury proposals, told employees of both companies he was “more energized than ever” about the transaction. Moreover, tax advisers had said the Treasury measures were unlikely to significantly impact most inversion deals. By domiciling the combined group in Britain, AbbVie would be able to cut its 22 percent tax rate to about 13 percent for the new company. Besides the tax advantage, Gonzalez said AbbVie was attracted to Shire’s portfolio of lucrative drugs to treat rare diseases and other medicines in development. Buying Shire would also reduce AbbVie’s reliance on arthritis treatment Humira, the world’s top selling medicine, whose $13 billion in annual sales accounts for more than 60 percent of company revenue. Although Humira’s U.S. patent lapses in 2016, AbbVie hopes it will take years for rivals to develop generic formulations. The number of tax-inversion deals, particularly in healthcare, have surged in the past year, putting pressure on the Obama administration to clamp down on corporate deals aimed at lowering tax bills. The U.S. Treasury proposed changes to tax regulations that would limit tax inversion, including a prohibition on “hopscotch” loans, which allow U.S. companies to access foreign cash without paying tax in the United States. Cenkos analyst Navid Malik said AbbVie, by calling for the board meeting, could be playing “hardball” to win better deal terms. “They could have put this out to try and get Shire back to the table to potentially renegotiate, but I don’t think that will happen,” he said. AbbVie, by walking away from Shire, would run the risk of finding itself a takeover target by a foreign acquirer with a cost-cutting bent, such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals International , said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal. BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei maintained his “Outperform” rating on AbbVie, saying it could shrug off the hefty breakup fee if positive trends for the company are seen this year - including the launch of a hepatitis C drug and favorable data from trials of potential blockbuster treatments for endometriosis and cancer. Pfizer abandoned its bid for AstraZeneca in May after its offer was rejected but, under UK takeover rules, can make another run at its British rival in late November. Many analysts have speculated Pfizer might indeed re-approach AstraZeneca with a higher bid, in hopes of locating the combined company in tax-friendlier Britain. But Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan late on Tuesday said AbbVie’s reconsideration of the Shire deal, presumably motivated in part by potential U.S. roadblocks for tax inversions, could dampen Pfizer’s interest in AstraZeneca. Some of the world’s top hedge fund managers, who had been building up “long” positions betting on future share price gains at Shire due to AbbVie’s bid interest, faced getting burnt by AbbVie’s decision. Data from Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) showed that no fund had a major “short” position of more than 0.5 percent that marked a bet on Shire’s shares falling in future. “We just don’t know what’s happened,” said one hedge fund manager, who declined to be named.

Each of the major indexes fell more than 2 percent shortly after the open, sending the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq into negative territory for the year, before paring losses. The Dow industrials fell into the red for 2014 on Friday. Concern over plunging oil prices, the potential impact of global economic weakness on U.S. earnings and the spread of Ebola have rattled markets recently. The S&P; 500 is on track for its sixth fall in eight sessions and is down nearly 8 percent since its Sept. 18 record closing high. Worries about a lethargic global economy weren’t helped by data that showed U.S. retail sales and producer prices fell in September, while manufacturing activity in New York slowed to its weakest pace since April. “The clincher is that some of the concerns about Europe and the other economies slowing down has reached our shores today with the retail sales number and the PPI number,” said Scott Armiger, portfolio manager at Christiana Trust in Greenville, Delaware. “It’s normal and it’s long overdue - markets can’t grind higher for that long without some sort of get back here.” Chicago-based AbbVie threw the pace of merger and acquisition activity into doubt. It said it was reconsidering its $55 billion takeover of Shire, weeks after the U.S. government moved to curb deals designed to reduce tax. U.S.-listed shares of Shire tumbled 21.7 percent to $191.55 while AbbVie shares dipped 0.5 percent to $53.85. At 12:02 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average  fell 272.71 points, or 1.67 percent, to 16,042.48, the S&P; 500  lost 31.28 points, or 1.67 percent, to 1,846.42 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 58.49 points, or 1.38 percent, to 4,168.68. In earnings news, Bank of America shares were off 4.9 percent to $15.71 after posting its third-quarter results. The S&P; financial sector fell 2.6 percent as the worst performing of the ten major S&P; sectors, all of which were in negative territory. S&P; 500 companies are expected to show earnings growth of 6.7 percent in the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, with revenue growth expected at 4 percent. The largest percentage gainer on the S&P; 500 was Cabot Oil & Gas, which rose 4.9 percent, while the largest percentage decliner was KeyCorp, down 8.0 percent. The largest percentage gainer on the Nasdaq 100 was Biogen Idec, which was rising 1.6 percent, while the largest percentage decliner was Intel, down 4.2 percent. Declining issues were outnumbering advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,301 to 757, for a 3.04-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,761 issues were falling and 850 advancing for a 2.07-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The benchmark S&P; 500 index was posting 2 new 52-week highs and 70 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 7 new highs and 225 new lows.

Data from Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulatory body showed that no fund had a major “short” position of more than 0.5 percent, indicating that most hedge funds were confident of the deal’s success. Billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson’s Paulson & Co along with Elliott Management, the investment arm of hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer, were among those that had built “long” positions after buying Shire shares. Shire’s value plunged more than 20 percent on Wednesday from around $49 billion to $39 billion, wiping around $500 million from the value of Paulson’s stake and $270 million off Elliott Management’s stake, according to Reuters calculations. Chicago-based AbbVie was eager to buy Shire to reduce its U.S. tax bill by moving its tax base to Britain. “It seems Abbvie is getting cold feet due to changes in tax rules in U.S. and also perhaps ongoing correction in markets,” said Amit Jain, co-founder of hedge fund Amagis Capital that held bets on the deal going through. The U.S. Treasury Department unveiled changes on Sept. 22 to the rules for so-called corporate “inversions,” which have become a cause of concern in Washington because of the threat posed to U.S. corporate income tax receipts. Shire’s shares fell 2.5 percent the day after the tax changes were announced and the stock’s latest slump has now wiped $13 billion off its market capitalization. Paulson had been steadily building a long position on Shire since June 23, when news of a potential deal first emerged. By Oct. 10, he had became the second-largest shareholder in Shire, owning 4.7 percent of the company, a stake worth 1.44 billion pounds ($2.29 billion) as of Oct. 14. Singer’s Elliott Management had a 1.4 percent stake while Magnetar Financial, whose strategies include “event-driven” trading such as takeover bid situations, had a 2.8 percent stake. The hit to Shire’s shares trended on Twitter under the banner of ‘Arbageddon’, signifying how merger arbitrage funds would have suffered from Shire’s slump. SteppenWolf Capital chief investment officer Phoebus Theologites said there was a high chance that specialist ‘merger arb’ funds would have been burnt by the drop in Shire stock. “That’s the name of the game - you win some, you lose some. We discussed going long Shire last year, as a takeover target, and I nixed it on the basis that a macro fund has no place trading specials or risk arbs,” said Theologites. One hedge fund with a position in Shire admitted being caught out by AbbVie’s change of heart. “We just don’t know what’s happened. One of these situations that is being held very closely. The tone from the AbbVie camp since the new U.S. rules has been very instructive up until now. They have been very keen to do the deal,” said the hedge fund manager, who declined to be named. “So there is a disconnect between the tone so far and what we see today. Figuring to where that disconnect comes from is key for us,” added the hedge fund manager. Nevertheless, in spite of Wednesday’s setback some hedge fund managers still held out hope that a deal could be reached. “The CEO of AbbVie has much at stake here, having so much pushed for the deal regardless of the tax benefits, so he surely has a vested interest in making it happen,” added another hedge fund manager, on condition of anonymity.

Nevertheless, in spite of Wednesday’s setback some hedge fund managers still held out hope that a deal could be reached. “The CEO of AbbVie has much at stake here, having so much pushed for the deal regardless of the tax benefits, so he surely has a vested interest in making it happen,” added another hedge fund manager, on condition of anonymity.

158,ABBV,US STOCKS-Wall St selloff continues on global economy worry,"* Shire shares tumble as AbbVie reconsiders bid * Retail sales drop more than expected in September * Producer prices fall for first time in over a year * Indexes off: Dow 1.2 pct, S&P; 1.2 pct, Nasdaq 0.98 pct   (Updates to late morning) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dropped on Wednesday as economic data reinforced worries over the health of the world economy and signs emerged of slowing merger activity. Each of the major indexes had fallen more than 2 percent shortly after the open, sending the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq into negative territory for the year, before paring losses. The Dow industrials fell into the red for 2014 on Friday. Concern over plunging oil prices, the potential impact of global economic weakness on U.S. earnings and the spread of Ebola have rattled markets recently. The S&P; 500 is on track for its sixth fall in eight sessions and is down nearly 8 percent since its Sept. 18 record closing high. Worries about a slowing global economy weren’t helped by data that showed U.S. retail sales and producer prices fell in September, while manufacturing activity in New York slowed to its weakest pace since April. “We had Empire State manufacturing coming in much lower than expected, we had retail sales coming in lower than expected, so there were signs, with this recent data, of an economic slowdown,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC  in Bernardsville, New Jersey. “You couple this with fears about the spread of Ebola, with the recent downtrend and what we had today, the mindset has been a flight to safety and cash is certainly a safe place to be in.” Chicago-based AbbVie threw the pace of merger and acquisition activity into doubt. It said it was reconsidering its $55 billion takeover of Shire, weeks after the U.S. government moved to curb deals designed to reduce tax. U.S.-listed shares of Shire tumbled 22.4 percent to $189.76 while AbbVie shares advanced 1.6 percent to $55. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 195.34 points, or 1.2 percent, to 16,119.85, the S&P; 500 lost 21.94 points, or 1.17 percent, to 1,855.76 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 41.28 points, or 0.98 percent, to 4,185.90. In earnings news, Bank of America shares were off 3 percent to $16.03 after posting its third-quarter results. The S&P; financial sector fell 2.1 percent as the worst performing of the ten major S&P; sectors, all of which were in negative territory. S&P; 500 companies are expected to show earnings growth of 6.7 percent in the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, with revenue growth expected at 4 percent. Later in the session at 2:00 p.m. (1800 GMT) the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book on business activity across the nation is expected. The largest percentage gainer on the S&P; 500 was Southwestern Energy, up 4.1 percent, while the largest percentage decliner was KeyCorp, down 6.1 percent. The largest percentage gainer on the Nasdaq 100 was NXP Semiconductors, up 2.2 percent, while the largest percentage decliner was Liberty Interactive, down 4.1 percent. Declining issues were outnumbering advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,116 to 896, for a 2.36-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,578 issues were falling and 971 advancing for a 1.63-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The benchmark S&P; 500 index was posting 2 new 52-week highs and 68 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 5 new highs and 206 new lows.

It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company’s proposed remedies or an EU member state’s request to handle the case. Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission  opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90  additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working  days. Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified — that is, ordinary first-stage reviews — until they are approved.

At 1505 GMT, the FTSE 100 was down 0.6 percent at 6,177.42 points after hitting its lowest level since June 2013 at 6,072 points earlier. The index was rebounding from deep in oversold territory, based on widely-used momentum indicators such as the Relative Strength Index, which compares the size of rises and falls. The bounce gathered momentum from the head of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank saying the U.S. central bank may want to keep up its bond-buying stimulus for now given a drop in inflation expectations. “That Bullard comment really gave it a lift,” Will Hedden, a trader at IG, said. Among single stocks, Shire slid 7.7 percent to 3,703 pence, adding to a 22 percent drop on Wednesday, after U.S. pharmaceutical company AbbVie recommended that shareholders vote against its $55 billion takeover of Shire after a U.S. government move to curb deals designed to cut high taxes. “The AbbVie deal does look dead in the immediate future. But Shire is still a quality business, and once the dust settles on this, I’d be looking to buy back into Shire shares at around 35 pounds,” said Central Markets trading analyst Joe Neighbour. Global equities have been pummelled by concerns about global economic growth as the Fed prepares to wind down its asset-purchase programme this month. With the FTSE now down nearly 11 percent since hitting its highest level since 2000 in early September, longer-term investors were starting to eye the potential for a rebound. “I don’t think there is any real, clear thing that is creating this anxiety,” said Patrick Armstrong, chief investment officer at Plurimi, who has a net long position in equities. “It seems (this is due to) general fears and people worried about the valuation so I think we’re going to start to see a bounce fairly shortly.”   (Additional reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)",10162014,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-stocks-ftse/uk-ftse-cuts-losses-helped-by-fed-stimulus-hopes-idUSL6N0SB4S220141016
166,ABBV,Banks could miss out on $135 million fees as Abbvie drops Shire deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - A decision by U.S. drugmaker AbbVie (ABBV.N) to scrap its plans to buy Dublin-based Shire (SHP.L) could mean that bankers miss out on up to $135 million in fees linked to the deal. Wall Street bank JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) risks being the biggest loser. It was sole adviser to Abbvie and had been set to earn $45 million in fees, a substantial portion of which were to be paid on completion, according to Abbvie’s deal prospectus.  Shire’s advisers  — Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Citi (C.N), Deutsche Bank  (DBKGn.DE) and Evercore (EVR.N) — were set to share a fee pool of between $70 and $90 million, according to estimates from Thomson Reuters/Freeman Consulting.  It is not known how much could still be payable to advisors. Bankers will typically earn about 10 percent of the fee total if a deal fails, according to the consulting firm. For example, British water company Severn Trent paid 19 million pounds ($30.4 million) in fees to its legal and financial advisers when it fended off a takeover bid by a Canadian-led consortium of investors in 2013.  “If a deal is hostile, defense advisers tend to get full fees,” Lam Nguyen, director at Freeman told Reuters.  “But even though this deal was not hostile, the target’s advisers might be liable to share a piece of the break-up fee but it really depends case-by-case”, he added.  JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Evercore and Citi could not immediately be reached for comment.  Abbvie was also set to pay $220 million in financing-related transaction fees, according to the prospectus, including $137 million for the establishment of an undrawn bridge facility arranged by JPMorgan.  AbbVie has recommended shareholders vote against the proposed $55 billion takeover of Shire after a change in U.S. tax rules.  The U-turn hands a major scalp to the U.S. Treasury, which has been fighting to make tax-avoiding acquisitions more difficult and could deter further dealmaking.  Abbvie is also liable to pay a break-up fee of about $1.64 billion if AbbVie’s shareholders follow the advice and reject the transaction. The Shire episode has also fueled doubts about whether Pfizer (PFE.N), which abandoned a $118 billion bid for AstraZeneca (AZN.L) in May after its offer was rejected, will ever make another run at its British rival.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index was down 1.9 percent at 6,096.17 points, having hit its lowest level since June 2013 at 6,072 points earlier. The index’s 4.6 percent fall over the past two days is the steepest since the height of the euro zone debt crisis in October 2011. It was the same type of crisis concerns that were rattling the market on Thursday, with Greek bonds and stocks plunging for two days now on concern about Athens’s plan to exit its bailout more than a year ahead of schedule and the threat of early elections next year. A raft of weak global economic data recently has also hit global equities, which have climbed to high valuations as the U.S. Federal Reserve winds down its asset-buying programme. An MSCI index of UK shares was trading at 13.6 percent times its expected earnings before the rout started, its highest multiple since 2005, Datastream data showed. Darren Easton, director of trading at Logic Investments, said he was “short” the FTSE - betting on future falls - for the near-term. “We’re still bearish in the short term,” he said. Easton said the FTSE could drop to 6,050 in October but he expected it to rally in December back up to 6,600 to 6,800 points. With the index now down nearly 12 percent since hitting its highest level since 2000 in early September, longer-term investors were starting to eye the potential for a rebound. “I don’t think there is any real, clear thing that is creating this anxiety,” said Patrick Armstrong, chief investment officer at Plurimi, who has a net long position in equities. “It seems (this is due to) general fears and people worried about the valuation so I think we’re going to start to see a bounce fairly shortly.” Among single stocks, Shire slid 9.3 percent to 3,639 pence, adding to a 22 percent drop on Wednesday, after U.S. pharmaceutical company AbbVie recommended that shareholders vote against its $55 billion takeover of Shire in the wake of a U.S. government move to curb deals designed to cut high taxes. “The AbbVie deal does look dead in the immediate future. But Shire is still a quality business, and once the dust settles on this, I’d be looking to buy back into Shire shares at around 35 pounds,” said Central Markets trading analyst Joe Neighbour.

171,ABBV,Shire slumps again as UK's FTSE steadies after sell-off,"* FTSE 100 steadies after 2.8 pct drop in previous session * Shire slumps again as AbbVie gets cold feet over deal * FTSE down around 8 pct since start of 2014 By Sudip Kar-Gupta LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Britain’s top equity index steadied on Thursday after a sharp sell-off in the previous session that had taken it to a 15-month low, although healthcare group Shire slumped for the second day in a row. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index was up by 0.2 percent, or 14.21 points, at 6,225.85 points in early session trading on Thursday, recovering slightly after a 2.8 percent drop on Wednesday that sent it to its lowest level since July 2013. Shire slid 9 percent to 3,647 pence, adding to a 22 percent drop on Wednesday, after U.S. pharmaceutical company AbbVie  recommended that shareholders vote against its $55 billion takeover of Shire in the wake of a U.S. government move to curb deals designed to cut high taxes. “The AbbVie deal does look dead in the immediate future. But Shire is still a quality business, and once the dust settles on this, I’d be looking to buy back into Shire shares at around 35 pounds,” said Central Markets trading analyst Joe Neighbour. The FTSE 100 hit a peak of 6,904.86 points at the start of September, which marked its highest level since early 2000. However, the index has since lost ground and is down 8 percent since the start of 2014, as concerns have increased about the fragile state of the European economy given weak data coming out of Germany in the last two weeks. Darren Easton, director of trading at Logic Investments, said he was “short” the FTSE - betting on future falls - for the near-term. “We’re still bearish in the short term,” he said. Easton said the FTSE could drop down to the 6,050 level during October, but he expected the FTSE to then rally in December and get back up to the 6,600-6,800 point range.

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission  opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90  additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working  days. Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified — that is, ordinary first-stage reviews — until they are approved.

174,ABBV,UPDATE 1-AbbVie says $55 billion acquisition of Shire officially dead,"(Adds CEO comment, background, share repurchase, share price) Oct 20 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc said on Monday it has reached agreement with Shire Plc to officially call off its proposed $55 billion purchase of the Irish company, and will pay Shire a $1.64 billion breakup fee for walking away from the deal. AbbVie, which last week said its board of directors had withdrawn its recommendation to proceed with the Shire purchase, blamed the unraveling on last month’s rules changes by the U.S. Treasury Department aimed at curtailing a wave of such deals in which U.S. companies would redomicile overseas to take advantage of lower corporate tax rates in other countries. In announcing termination of the agreement, AbbVie said the U.S. Treasury moves “re-interpreted longstanding tax principles in a uniquely selective manner designed specifically to destroy the financial benefits of these types of transactions.” AbbVie said the new rules would keep it from gaining access to its overseas cash without having to pay hefty U.S. taxes. The company’s Chief Executive, Richard Gonzalez, on a conference call with investors, said the new rules and possible future changes “created an environment of risk and uncertainty which makes proceeding not in the best interest of our shareholders.” AbbVie, which was spun off from Abbott Laboratories in early 2013, said it conducted a thorough review of the Treasury rules changes on so-called tax inversion deals to explore options aimed at preserving the merger. “The executive management team ultimately concluded that the transaction was no longer in the best interests of stockholders at the agreed upon valuation, and the board fully supported that conclusion,” the company said in a statement. In addition to tax benefits, the acquisition would have given AbbVie Shire’s portfolio of lucrative medicines for rare diseases and other specialty drugs, lessening the Chicago-based company’s dependence on its rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira - currently the world’s top selling drug with annual sales approaching $13 billion. Separately, AbbVie announced moves aimed at returning cash to shareholders. It said its board had authorized a new $5 billion stock repurchase program and a nearly 17 percent increase of its quarterly dividend payment to 49 cents a share.

177,ABBV,REFILE-UPDATE 1-Shire CFO to leave drugmaker as AbbVie drops bid,"(Removes extraneous word in paragraph 7) LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - British drugmaker Shire  will lose its interim chief financial officer early next year to water supplier Severn Trent, the latest blow for Shire, whose proposed $55-billion acquisition by U.S. rival AbbVie  was aborted last week. Shire’s James Bowling will leave the Dublin-based firm at the end of the first quarter of 2015 and become chief financial officer at Severn Trent to replace retiring CFO Mike McKeon. His departure hints at the disruption caused by AbbVie’s on-off deal to acquire Shire, with the prospect of becoming part of a Chicago-based group prompting some Shire executives to look elsewhere for opportunities. AbbVie’s move for Shire, a leader in drugs to treat attention deficit disorder and rare diseases, was announced in July amid a spate of deals in the pharmaceutical sector largely driven by tax savings. But AbbVie’s U-turn after the U.S. government proposed new tax rules has now focused attention on Shire’s future as an independent company and its own potential for making acquisitions, or else becoming a target once again. Bowling took over in the CFO role at Shire on an interim basis on March 1 when the finance director at the time, Graham Hetherington, stepped down. Shares in Shire were down 1 percent at 0737 GMT, while Severn Trent shares were flat. Severn Trent also said on Monday that it would cut three director posts with effect from Jan. 23, leaving two executive directors and six non-executive directors.

179,ABBV,"AbbVie CEO Gonzalez loses Shire, but wins praise for gutsy move","NEW YORK (Reuters) - (This story has been refiled from the Oct. 20 story to fix a typo in the headline) AbbVie (ABBV.N) Chief Executive Officer Richard Gonzalez for three months led the charge to buy Dublin drugmaker Shire for $55 billion, only to walk away from the deal last week, but analysts and fund managers said he deserves credit for trying and should remain at the helm of the Chicago drugmaker.  The merger could have been a defining triumph for Gonzalez, a quiet and low-profile manager who has been building an ambitious lineup of experimental drugs since his company was spun off in early 2013 from Abbott Laboratories. During his decades at Abbott, Gonzalez seldom emerged from the shadow of blustery Chief Executive Miles White, and the Shire deal gave him a rare burst of limelight. Investors were given no advance warning on Thursday, when  AbbVie recommended that its shareholders reject the Shire transaction, and it agreed to pay Shire a $1.64 billion breakup fee. “This came as a complete surprise both to investors and to Shire and they have a legitimate gripe about how AbbVie handled the communication,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal. Although it could take AbbVie a long time to regain investor trust, Gal predicted investors will not hold Gonzalez, 60,  personally responsible for the collapsed Shire deal because circumstances changed in recent weeks. By buying Shire and relocating the combined company to Britain, AbbVie hoped to slash its corporate tax rate, in one of the biggest such “tax inversions” attempted by any U.S. company. And Shire’s lucrative drugs for rare diseases and attention deficit disorder would have lessened AbbVie’s reliance on its arthritis treatment Humira, the world’s biggest-selling drug, whose $13 billion in annual revenue comprise almost 60 percent of AbbVie sales. AbbVie late on Monday said its board pulled out of the deal because of reinterpretations of tax law made on Sept. 22 by the the U.S. Treasury Department, which would have destroyed financial benefits of inversion deals.  “Treasury flipped it on its head, turning a very good deal into a very bad one,” Glenn Tilton, an independent director of AbbVie, said in an interview on Monday.  Moreover, Tilton said Treasury left the door open for more changes in tax law, which would have posed additional risk to AbbVie and its shareholders.  Jeff Jonas, an analyst with Gabelli & Co, said Gonzalez’ job looks safe, as long as he continues to spearhead development of experimental AbbVie treatments for hepatitis C, cancer, endometriosis, multiple sclerosis and other drugs that could be approved before Humira loses ground to generics in the next few years. “Overall he’s done a great job diversifying the company away from Humira,” said Jonas, whose company sold its AbbVie shares last year. “Their R&D; portfolio is very strong.” But Jonas said AbbVie needs to remain on the hunt for other deals to bolster its drug lineup. In its agreement to buy Shire, AbbVie was likely unable to renegotiate the terms of the merger in the case of extenuating circumstances, such as changes in U.S. tax laws, because British Takeover Panel rules are very stringent and don’t allow for any amendments to a deal structure once it is announced.  “Some shareholders will be disappointed in (Gonzalez’)  performance,” said Marshall Gordon, an analyst with ClearBridge Investments, which holds 1 million shares of AbbVie. “But I think he tried to put a good deal together and unfortunately the government changed the rules midstream in a way that was hard to predict.” Oliver Pursche, co-portfolio manager with Gary Goldberg Financial Services, however, said Gonzalez’ survival is anything but assured. “If AbbVie’s stock rebounds and goes up, and Treasury gets Congress to enact legislation that would make inversions unattractive, Gonzalez will get some credit. But the ultimate determinant will be the stock price, and that’s a question that won’t be answered for six months or longer.” Gonzalez elevated his profile with the ambitious run at Shire, said Raghuram Selvaraju, an analyst with Aegis Capital.  “Gonzalez was considered faceless until he came up with the Shire idea,” said Selvaraju. “By being so willing to up the ante, he showed he’s a gutsy guy.” AbbVie’s final offer was equal to more than 10 times Shire’s annual sales, Selvaraju said, far richer than the typical formula of 5 to 7 times annual sales for deals that Gonzalez helped negotiate at Abbott during his 30-year career there, including as head of pharmaceuticals, medical products and hospital products.

184,ABBV,Jilted Shire raises guidance again after earnings jump,"LONDON (Reuters) - Pharmaceutical firm Shire (SHP.L) raised its guidance for full-year earnings on Friday, lauding its strong prospects as a standalone company after AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) this week officially ditched its $55 billion bid for the group. Shire's shares, which had fallen back to the levels they were trading at before AbbVie's interest, were up 3.2 percent to 4,020 pence by 8.29 a.m. EDT, making them the biggest gainer on the FTSE 100 Index .FTSE. The Dublin-based group, which produces drugs to treat hyperactivity and rare diseases, posted a 60 percent rise in third-quarter earnings per American depository share to $2.93 on revenue up nearly a third at $1.6 billion. “Our performance this quarter demonstrates that Shire is resilient and we have not lost our focus,” said Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov. Shire had exciting prospects as an independent business focused on rare diseases and specialty indications, he said.  “We have a renewed sense of urgency to deliver superior value to shareholders and improved outcomes to our patients,” he added. Strong product sales growth in the quarter, led by a 66 percent jump in its rare disease unit, aided by its acquisition of ViroPharma a year ago, led to a rise in earnings guidance for the third consecutive quarter. Shire now expects to deliver earnings growth in the high 30 percent range for the full year, up from its expectations in July of growth in the low-to-mid 30 percent range. Analysts at Jefferies had been looking for full-year earnings growth of 32 percent. “Importantly there are no obvious signs of disruption from the now terminated AbbVie deal,” they said. “Longer term, the compelling growth trajectory at an attractive premium drives our “buy”.” AbbVie walked away from the 5,248 pence a share deal after the U.S. Treasury department tightened its rules to curtail companies doing deals that would allow them to redomicile overseas to cut corporate tax rates.  In its initial defense against a takeover, Shire had said it planned to double sales to $10 billion by 2020, $7 billion of which would come from its existing products and $3 billion from its pipeline. Ornskov said on Friday the target was absolutely achievable. Growth in Shire’s own drugs, which included ADHD blockbuster Vyvanse, would be supplemented by acquisitions, he said, with targets in specialty indications that typically affected small numbers of patients with unmet needs. Shire had $9 billion of firepower to make acquisitions, analysts at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said in June. That sum will be boosted by a break fee of $1.635 billion payable by AbbVie to Shire. Possible acquisitions include NPS Pharmaceuticals NPSP.O, Salix Pharmaceuticals SLXP.O and Cubist Pharmaceuticals CBST.O, according to reports. Shire itself could again be a target for Botox maker Allergan Inc (AGN.N).  Ornskov declined to comment on individual targets or on the timing of acquisitions, but he said Shire’s deals team had continued working throughout the aborted AbbVie takeover.  “Both on the results side and in business development the team continued uninterrupted,” he said. Ornskov said he was committed to leading an independent Shire. “The best opportunity I have is to lead Shire, and I’m very pleased I have that opportunity again,” he said.

187,ABBV,Express Scripts says AbbVie drug could displace Sovaldi on formulary,"(Reuters) - Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co said it may quickly change its preferred drug formulary to favor an expected new hepatitis C drug from AbbVie if it is clinically equivalent and less costly than Gilead Science Inc’s $84,000 Sovaldi and $94,500 Harvoni treatments. Sovaldi, with its price tag of $1,000 a pill, has become a lightning rod in a debate over the high cost of specialty drugs, despite its cure rate of more than 90 percent and gentle side effect profile. “The cost of it is unsustainable for many of our plans,” Steve Miller, chief medical officer of Express Scripts, told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday, referring to Sovaldi. The drug had third quarter sales of $2.8 billion even though it was only approved in December. Harvoni, approved this month by U.S. regulators, combines Sovaldi with another Gilead drug and is expected to dominate treatment of the liver disease that affects an estimated 3 million Americans.     Miller said Sovaldi’s cost is particularly hitting state prisons and Medicaid, the insurance program for the indigent funded jointly by states and the federal government, because those populations have high rates of infection with the hepatitis C virus. Express Scripts said U.S. regulators by December could approve AbbVie’s product, which combines three drugs into a single pill. “(We) are hoping they take a different approach when it comes to pricing,” Miller said. But Adelle Infante, an AbbVie spokeswoman, said no price has  been disclosed for her company’s drug, which does not yet have a name. The suburban Chicago drugmaker is hoping it will be approved this year. Gilead officials could not immediately be reached for comment. The AbbVie product, like Harvoni, would not need to be taken with interferon, a harsh injectable drug that for years had been part of a standard regimen for the disease, which can quietly harm or destroy the liver over a period of decades. Should the AbbVie drug be deemed clinically equivalent but less costly than Sovaldi and Harvoni, Express Scripts spokesman Brian Henry said the Gilead drugs could be given lower priority on its drug formulary, or be removed from it.  Express Scripts is the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager.  It administers drug benefits for employers and health plans and also runs large mail order pharmacies. Shares of Gilead, which on Tuesday reported a more than tripling of net profit for the third quarter, were down 3.6 percent in afternoon trading.

The Dow was on track to set a new closing record high as well, along with the S&P; 500, after the December e-minis contract hit an intraday record.

193,ABBV,AbbVie says strong results lessen need for big deal,"(Reuters) - AbbVie, which this month abandoned its planned $55 billion purchase of Dublin drugmaker Shire (SHP.L), reported impressive quarterly earnings on demand for its Humira arthritis drug and said it could deliver strong long-term growth without rushing into another big merger attempt. “The underlying growth prospects of AbbVie don’t require us to do a deal of that size,” AbbVie Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez said in conference call, but added the company was keen on smaller acquisitions, particularly of treatments involving rare diseases, cancer and hepatology. AbbVie shares rose 3.5 percent to $63.35 in morning trading. The Chicago drugmaker, which significantly boosted its full-year earnings forecast, said it had earned $506 million, or 31 cents per share, in the third quarter. That compared with $964 million, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding special items, including charges for the attempted Shire deal, AbbVie earned 89 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 77 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 7.8 percent to $5.02 billion, $200 million above forecasts. “We see today’s results as reinforcing our view that AbbVie shares remain well-positioned heading into 2015,” said JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott. He said AbbVie could win U.S. marketing approval within weeks for a combination treatment for hepatitis C that may bolster earnings next year and beyond. AbbVie, spun off early last year from Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), is also testing treatments for cancer, Parkinson’s Disease, endometriosis and other diseases.  The company had hoped to buy Shire and locate the combined company in Britain to take advantage of the nation’s lower tax rate. But AbbVie walked away after tax law changes announced by the U.S. Treasury made the tax-inversion deal less attractive. Sales of Humira, the world’s top-selling drug, jumped almost 18 percent to $3.26 billion. They accounted for 65 percent of total sales, underscoring the company’s need for other products to broaden its portfolio. Gonzalez attributed Humira’s sales growth to the wide range of approved uses of the drug, including for Crohn’s disease and psoriasis, and because it is still being introduced in more countries 12 years after its U.S. launch. Although Humira’s U.S. patent lapses in late 2016, AbbVie has said it will take years for other drugmakers to develop and win approval for their own generic versions. A few other AbbVie brands showed strong growth in the quarter, including thyroid hormone replacement drug Synthroid, whose sales rose 24 percent to $200 million.  But others declined, including cholesterol treatments and AndroGel testosterone gel, whose sales have been hurt by safety concerns for the drug class.  AbbVie raised its 2014 profit forecast to between $3.25 and $3.27 per share from its prior view of $3.06 to $3.16.

The S&P; 500 came within 0.1 percent of its record high, after the December e-minis contract hit an intraday record earlier. Gains were broad, with 123 new 52-week highs on the S&P; 500 versus just two new lows. The Nasdaq Composite recorded 209 new highs and 27 new lows. The BoJ’s board voted 5-4 to accelerate purchases of Japanese government bonds while tripling its purchases of exchange-traded funds and real-estate investment trusts. At the same time, Japan’s $1.2 trillion Government Pension Investment Fund announced new allocations for its portfolio, raising its holdings of domestic and foreign stock holdings to 25 percent each from 12 percent. “It’s not just the (BoJ) easing but the asset allocation from the pension plan is of course also helpful,” said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies and solutions at Voya Investment Management in New York. “Economic growth (in the United States) is looking pretty good, earnings are good. ... We will end the year certainly closer to 2,100 than 2,000 on the S&P; 500,” he added. The quarterly earnings season has been strong so far, with 75.8 percent of S&P; 500 components reporting earnings above analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, above the 63 percent average in the past 20 years. At 11:59 a.m. (1559 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  rose 166.08 points, or 0.97 percent, to 17,361.5, the S&P; 500 gained 19.49 points, or 0.98 percent, to 2,014.14, and the Nasdaq Composite added 55.47 points, or 1.21 percent, to 4,621.61.

A strong dollar makes commodities such as oil more expensive for buyers using other currencies “If you’re holding gold as a hedge against inflation, how long can you stay there? It’s been a losing trade for a while now,” Zemsky said. U.S. consumer spending fell for the first time in eight months in September, but the slowdown is likely to be temporary, as other data showed wages in the third quarter recorded their largest increase in more than six years.

They accounted for 65 percent of total sales, underscoring the company’s need for other products to broaden its portfolio. Gonzalez attributed Humira’s sales growth to the wide range of approved uses of the drug, including for Crohn’s disease and psoriasis, and because it is still being introduced in more countries 12 years after its U.S. launch. Although Humira’s U.S. patent lapses in late 2016, AbbVie has said it will take years for other drugmakers to develop and win approval for their own generic versions. A few other AbbVie brands showed strong growth in the quarter, including thyroid hormone replacement drug Synthroid, whose sales rose 24 percent to $200 million. But others declined, including cholesterol treatments and AndroGel testosterone gel, whose sales have been hurt by safety concerns for the drug class. AbbVie raised its 2014 profit forecast to between $3.25 and $3.27 per share from its prior view of $3.06 to $3.16.

The S&P; 500 came within 0.25 percent of its record and the December e-minis contract hit an intraday record earlier. Gains were broad, with close to 90 S&P; 500 components hitting new 52-week highs and around 90 more trading within 2 percent of a record. The BOJ’s board voted 5-4 to accelerate purchases of Japanese government bonds while tripling its purchases of exchange-traded funds and real-estate investment trusts. At the same time, Japan’s $1.2 trillion Government Pension Investment Fund announced new allocations for its portfolio, including raising its holdings of domestic and foreign stock holdings to 25 percent each from 12 percent. A Nikkei newspaper report on this announcement on Thursday contributed to an afternoon move higher in U.S. stocks. The timing of the moves sends a strong signal to investors, as six years of aggressive U.S. stimulus come to an end and as euro zone inflation data kept pressure on the European Central Bank to further ease monetary policy. “It’s not just the (BOJ) easing but the asset allocation from the pension plan is of course also helpful,” said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies and solutions at Voya Investment Management in New York. “Economic growth (in the United States) is looking pretty good, earnings are good ... we will end the year certainly closer to 2,100 than 2,000 on the S&P; 500.” So far this earnings season has been strong, with 75.5 percent of S&P; 500 components reporting earnings above analyst expectations according to Thomson Reuters data, above the 63 percent average in the past 20 years. At 10:37 a.m. (1437 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was up 165.81 points, or 0.96 percent, to 17,361.23, the S&P; 500 had gained 19.92 points, or 1 percent, to 2,014.57 and the Nasdaq Composite added 62.13 points, or 1.36 percent, to 4,628.27. The U.S. dollar rallied as well, pressuring crude oil prices and spot gold, which dropped 2.6 percent, the most for any day this year. “If you’re holding gold as a hedge against inflation, how long can you stay there? It’s been a losing trade for a while now,” Voya’s Zemsky said. U.S. consumer spending fell for the first time in eight months in September but the slowdown is likely to be temporary, as other data showed wages in the third quarter recorded their largest increase in more than six years. Abbvie shares rose 3 percent to $63 after the drugmaker reported quarterly earnings. GoPro shares jumped 13.4 percent to $77.41 the day after it forecast better-than-expected holiday quarter sales. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 2,150 to 741, for a 2.90-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,923 issues rose and 637 fell for a 3.02-to-1 ratio favoring advancers. The benchmark S&P; 500 index was posting 120 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 196 new highs and 24 new lows.

201,ABBV,UPDATE 1-Elliott Associates may sue AbbVie over scuttled deal,"(Adds details, background) By Svea Herbst-Bayliss BOSTON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Hedge fund Elliott Associates may take legal action against pharmaceuticals company AbbVie Inc  for scuttling a merger deal with Shire Plc. Elliott said in a quarterly letter to investors that it was disappointed when AbbVie’s board withdrew its support for the deal in October after executives had signaled strong interest in late September. The $25.4 billion New York-based hedge fund founded by Paul Singer holds 7.85 million shares of Shire, according to a regulatory filing made on Oct. 15. “We are exploring our options with respect to this matter, including whether to assert claims against AbbVie for making false and misleading statements about the transaction,” the fund wrote in the letter, which was seen by Reuters. Elliott Associates said it made money on its Shire position in the third quarter, but suffered a loss in the fourth quarter when the share price tumbled on news the deal would collapse. The AbbVie-Shire deal was a so-called inversion transaction in which the acquiring company moves its headquarters to its target’s home base to take advantage of lower tax rates. The U.S. government threw cold water on these deals in September when it issued rules limiting the tax benefits. Elliott said these changes should not have influenced the prospects for the AbbVie Shire tie-up. “While the Treasury regulations reduced the attractiveness of the transaction to AbbVie, it would have been significantly accretive to AbbVie while preserving the aforementioned strategic benefits,” the letter said. An Elliott spokesman declined to elaborate further. An AbbVie official did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Elliott is closely watched in the hedge fund industry, both for its strong returns and its willingness to wage lawsuits. The fund gained 7.6 percent for the year through the end of September and rose 2.9 percent during the third quarter. It did not say how much the bet on Shire helped during the third quarter or hurt more recently.

The company is developing the drug with Enanta Pharmaceuticals Inc. AbbVie said on Tuesday 100 percent of the patients who were given the drug and had failed previous treatment showed high response rates at 12 weeks after the treatment. Genotype 4 variant of the hepatitis C virus is more frequent in the Middle East and Africa, affecting about 34 million people across the world.

205,ABBV,Scuttled deals worth $580 bln put hedge funds on back foot,"* Event driven funds lose $3.3 bln in outflows in two months * Such funds gathered $10 bln until August on gains in 2013 * Abandoned Shire-AbbVie deal led to loss for several funds By Nishant Kumar LONDON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Hedge funds specialising in bets on mergers and acquisitions are starting to see investors withdraw funds, prompting them to take a more cautious approach after being caught out by more than 500 corporate deals globally failing this year. Part of a broader industry strategy aimed at making money from major corporate events, these deal-focused funds gained an average 13 percent in 2013, their best year since 2010, which helped them lure in a net $10 billion in new cash through August this year, data from industry tracker Eurekahedge showed. But a series of failed deals, including the collapse of a $55 billion tie-up between UK drugmaker Shire and U.S. peer AbbVie, has led to losses for some of the world’s biggest proponents of the strategy, with investors pulling out $3.3 billion in the last two months alone. “The AbbVie/Shire break, in particular, has led to a far reaching de-risking exercise for many funds,” said Pierre di Maria, head of event driven strategy at Cheyne Capital. “Those funds have reduced their gross exposure to deals in order to lessen their overall risk and to be able to face any upcoming redemptions,” he added. The year had started well as a combination of low interest rates, weak global economic growth and companies flush with cash boosted M&A; deals. As of Nov. 10, deal volume was up 47 percent year-on-year to $2.9 trillion, Thomson Reuters data showed. However, at the same time, deals worth $580 billion have been pulled, the most since 2008, trapping many funds on the wrong side of the so called “merger arbitrage” trade, which aims to eke out returns by capturing the spread between a company’s market price and the price at which it may be acquired. The recent blow from AbbVie pulling its bid for Shire — after the U.S. government moved to curb deals designed to cut taxes — has led to losses for the likes of Paulson & Co, Tyrus Capital and Elliott Management. “The deal breaks have made managers more conscious of political risk and intervention within the M&A; space,” said Jeff Holland, a managing director at hedge fund investor Liongate Capital Management. While the Shire deal was only the fourth-biggest deal to fall apart this year, behind the abandoned 70 billion pounds ($110.4 billion) bid by Pfizer for AstraZeneca  in May, many funds had bet big on its success. That concentration was reflected in Shire’s share price fall when the deal broke up — 22 percent, about twice that of AstraZeneca when it went through a similar situation. Following the Shire deal collapse, merger arbitrage spreads, or the difference between a company’s share price and the price at which it may be bought, on other deals widened by 2.5 percent on average as a number of hedge funds liquidated positions, presenting an investment opportunity for some, said Di Maria of Cheyne Capital, adding he had nearly doubled the size of his merger arbitrage portfolio. Hedge fund manager John Paulson, who invested 1.44 billion pounds in Shire on Oct. 14, saw his Advantage fund lose 13.6 percent in October, according to an investor, while Elliott Associates said it may take legal action against AbbVie for scuttling the deal and losses. Another fund to take a hit was Tyrus Capital, which bet both on Shire’s share price rising and AbbVie’s share price falling. The $1.4 billion Tyrus Capital Event Fund ended October down about 6.5 percent, fund data obtained by Reuters showed. “This has raised questions about portfolio concentration of hedge funds on some risky M&A; deals,” said Philippe Ferreira, head of research at Lyxor Asset Management. “We are advising investors having a strong exposure to event driven to diversify their portfolios,” he added. An index from Eurekahedge tracking event-driven funds fell 2.1 percent in October, its biggest monthly decline since 2011, highlighting their poor recent performance. Investors keen to capture merger arbitrage returns, which are less correlated to other strategies, but reluctant to shoulder the risk of losses from another big deal collapse, may also consider passive funds, which buy and sell stocks involved in deals but tend to be more diversified. Such a strategy has already outperformed the average active event driven hedge fund manager this year. The IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF, for example, has returned 3.4 percent this year and was flat in October.

206,ABBV,"Europe gives green light to AbbVie hepatitis C drugs, others","LONDON (Reuters) - European regulators recommended approval for two drugs made by AbbVie to treat hepatitis C, both of which belong to a new generation of medicines that have proved effective in treating a condition that is the most common cause of liver transplants in Europe. Dasabuvir, known commercially as Exviera, and a combination therapy called Viekirax, gave physicians additional treatment options with high cure rates, the European Medicines Agency said on Friday. The all-oral regimens for patients infected with the virus avoided the need for interferons, which are delivered by injection, the agency said. Sanofi’s eliglustat, a medicine marketed as Cerdelga to treat the rare genetic disorder type 1 Gaucher disease that was approved in the United States in August, was also given the green light in Europe.  The European Medicines Agency said patients could take the drug orally, making it a convenient alternative to other treatments delivered by intravenous injection. Boehringer Ingelheim’s lung-disorder drug nintedanib was also recommended for approval on Friday. The regulator gave the nod to Novartis’ anti-inflammation drug secukinumab, or Cosentyx, to treat the most common form of the painful, unsightly skin condition plaque-psoriasis. Celgene’s apremilast, known as Otezla, was recommended to treat both psoriatic arthritis, which is a type of arthritis associated with the skin disease psoriasis that cause joint pain, stiffness and swelling, and for moderate to severe cases of psoriasis itself. The drug was approved in the United States in March. Recommendations for marketing approval by the European Medicine Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use are usually endorsed by the European Commission within a couple of months.

207,ABBV,"Shire CEO eyes deals, but no urgency to spend AbbVie breakup fee","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shire PLC’s (SHP.L) chief executive said he sees no urgency to spend the windfall the Dublin-based drugmaker received when AbbVie (ABBV.N) walked away from a $55 billion takeover bid earlier this year. AbbVie scuttled the so-called inversion deal in October after changes in U.S. tax rules aimed at preventing U.S. companies from redomiciling abroad to take advantage of lower corporate taxes. “It’s very nice that we got almost $1.7 billion in breakup fee. I think that was well deserved,” Shire Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov said in an interview following a presentation for analysts and investors in New York showcasing drugs Shire is developing. “Our investors want us to spend the money on driving growth and innovation and fulfilling patient needs, but I have no particular burning need to spend it immediately,” Ornskov said. “I and the board have already moved on. We’re focused on Shire as an independent company. We got a good break fee that we can put to future use.” Ornskov was widely expected to leave the company had the AbbVie deal gone through. With that distraction behind, the CEO is focused on bringing to market drugs for rare diseases, particularly those aimed at treating the suffering of children. “I feel like a really lucky guy,” said the Danish pharma industry veteran, who became Shire CEO in April 2013. “I work in field that’s incredibly fulfilling. A lot of products that we are developing are targeted at the pediatric part of the population, and I would like to continue that mission with my team.” Ornskov called the company’s goal of reaching $10 billion in annual sales by 2020 “challenging but achievable.” That would be about double the company’s annual revenue in 2013. The goal was based on $7 billion from existing products and $3 billion from the pipeline, but investors can expect revenue from future deals as well. “The goal was developed without thinking that we would be needing to do additional deals, but I can assure you that we will be doing additional deals before 2020,” Ornskov said. “That’s in our DNA. It’s how we grow our business, so that will be on top of this goal.” ",12112014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-shire-ceo/shire-ceo-eyes-deals-but-no-urgency-to-spend-abbvie-breakup-fee-idUSKBN0JP00U20141211

212,ABBV,U.S. FDA approves AbbVie all-oral hepatitis C treatment,"(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Friday approved AbbVie’s all-oral treatment for hepatitis C, providing the first competition for Gilead Sciences huge selling and expensive medicine for the liver-destroying virus. The AbbVie regimen consists of four different anti-viral drugs to be taken as three pills in the morning and one in the evening. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the regimen, which will be sold under the brand name Viekira Pak, for patients with genotype 1 form of the virus, the most common  type of hepatitis C and the most difficult to treat.   Gilead’s Sovaldi, which was approved a year ago, had been selling at the rate of about $3 billion per quarter due to huge pent up demand. Sovaldi is now combined with another Gilead drug and sold as Harvoni, which is taken as one pill once a day for  12 weeks at a cost of about $94,500. Some patients can take it for just eight weeks, which costs about $63,000.  The AbbVie regimen has demonstrated similarly impressive efficacy to Gilead’s, with cure rates above 90 percent, and minimal negative side effects.  But Gilead, which has come under intense pressure from U.S. health insurers, politicians and pharmacy benefit managers over the high cost of its treatment, is widely expected to dominate the market, given its convenience advantage of fewer pills and  drugs, unless AbbVie undercuts Harvoni on pricing. AbbVie did not immediately announce the price of its treatment. The AbbVie treatment is awaiting a European approval decision expected in the first quarter of 2015 after an advisory committee gave it a positive recommendation. Hepatitis C, estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans and at least 130 million people worldwide, is a progressive viral disease that if left untreated can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure, cancer or need for at transplant.

Major indexes opened with slight gains but strengthened throughout the session, ending near their highs of the day. Despite that, trading was quiet with many market participants out ahead of the upcoming Christmas holiday. About 6.41 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, compared with the month-to-date average of 7.86 billion. Tech was the strongest sector of the day, with the S&P; information technology sector up 1.1 percent. Intel Corp rose 2.3 percent to $37.21, providing the biggest boost to the Dow, while IBM rose 1.8 percent to $161.44 and Cisco Systems rose 1.6 percent to $28.22. Priceline Group rose 3.6 percent to $1,149.38. “I wouldn’t put a lot of weight on this week’s trading, given year-end maneuvers and how slow it is,” said Rex Macey, chief allocation officer at Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors in Atlanta, Georgia. “While I’m comfortable with the level of the broader market, I don’t think there are obvious bargains. Some may say oil stocks are bargains now, but it’s too soon to say.” Crude oil sank 3.2 percent after Saudi Arabia’s powerful oil minister said OPEC would not cut production at any price. The S&P; energy index fell 1 percent as one of the day’s weakest sectors; Chesapeake Energy  fell 7.3 percent to $18.42 while Southwestern Energy  was off 5.5 percent at $29.31. Crude oil is coming off four straight weeks of declines, and has fallen in 11 of the past 12 completed weeks. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 154.64 points, or 0.87 percent, to 17,959.44, the S&P; 500 gained 7.89 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,078.54 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 16.04 points, or 0.34 percent, to 4,781.42. Both the Dow and S&P; ended at closing records, with the benchmark S&P; building on a 3.4 percent rise last week. That advance came after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would take a “patient” approach toward raising interest rates and oil prices appeared to stabilize. Gilead slumped 14 percent to $92.90 as the biggest drag on both the S&P; and Nasdaq 100. Express Scripts , the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, said it would no longer cover Gilead’s treatments after it lined up a cheaper price from AbbVie Inc for its newly approved hepatitis C treatment. Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc said it would test a combination of two of its experimental hepatitis C drugs which showed promise in separate studies. Shares surged 10 percent to $15.61.

218,ABBV,UPDATE 3-Express Scripts drops Gilead hep C drugs for cheaper AbbVie rival,"(Adds Molina CEO quote) By Caroline Humer Dec 22 (Reuters) - The largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager said on Monday it has lined up a cheaper price for AbbVie Inc’s  newly approved hepatitis C treatment and, in most cases, will no longer cover Gilead Sciences Inc’s  treatments after trying for nearly a year to win a deeper discount. Express Scripts’ move reignited investor concerns that pharmaceutical companies will have to bow to pricing pressure from U.S. insurers and lawmakers over novel medications whose cost can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars for some diseases. Gilead shares dropped 13 percent, or about $14.54, in Monday trading to $93.88, though it was still far above the $65 level reached in April, when insurers launched a major outcry over its multibillion-dollar hepatitis C business. Shares in major biotechnology companies such as Amgen, Biogen  and Celgene fell more than 2 percent. Express Scripts opposed the $84,000 price tag of Gilead Sciences’ Sovaldi treatment since its approval a year ago. It said the $1,000-a-day pill, shown to cure hepatitis C in most patients, was unaffordable. Private insurers generally receive discounts of as much as 20 percent, but Gilead has resisted, bringing in $3 billion in quarterly revenue for Sovaldi this year. The company maintains that Sovaldi, and a next-generation version called Harvoni that was approved in October, will save the U.S. healthcare system the costs of caring for advanced liver disease in many patients. Gilead spokeswoman Cara Miller said on Monday in an e-mailed statement that the company is continuing to negotiate with Express Scripts. AbbVie’s Viekira Pak drug was approved on Friday by U.S. regulators and the company set a list price of $83,319. But it has agreed to a significantly lower price than Gilead for Express Scripts’ National Preferred Formulary, a list of approved and covered drugs for 25 million Americans, Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview. “This is unprecedented,” Miller said, explaining that the pricing on specialty drugs of this type tend to be much closer even when a competitor enters the market. He did not provide a specific dollar figure, but said AbbVie had narrowed the price gap to resemble what Western European countries pay for  Sovaldi, which runs from $51,373 in France to $66,000 in Germany. An estimated 3.2 million people in the United States have hepatitis C. Most insurance plans have paid for Gilead’s drugs only for patients with advanced liver disease to limit their exposure to its cost. Express Scripts said the AbbVie agreement will allow it to extend treatment to all hepatitis C patients. Dr. Camilla Graham, co-director of the viral hepatitis center at Beth Israel Deaconess medical center in Boston, said she is hopeful other insurers will follow suit. “My first thought when I saw this was ‘Finally, we have a solution to this public health crisis,’” Graham said. A significant portion of patients with hepatitis C receive medical care through government-paid programs, including Medicare for the elderly and disabled, Medicaid for the poor and the U.S. Department of Defense. State Medicaid agencies have also limited access to Gilead’s Sovaldi, saying it is too expensive even after they receive a legally mandated 23 percent discount. Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, said he is “hopeful but cautious” about the state agencies’ ability to extract further rebates on top of the discount from Gilead and AbbVie. America’s Health Insurance Plans, the insurance industry’s largest lobbying group, also hopes to see Gilead’s prices drop now that there is competition in the market, said spokesman Brendan Buck. The AbbVie regimen consists of a cocktail of anti-viral drugs to be taken as three pills in the morning and one in the evening. The regimen requires some patients also to take ribavirin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the regimen for patients with genotype 1 form of the virus, the most common type of hepatitis C and the most difficult to treat. Express Scripts said starting Jan. 1, 2015, it would pay for the AbbVie drug only for patients who have genotype 1. Express Scripts will no longer cover Gilead’s Harvoni, a one-pill treatment for patients with genotype 1 that costs $94,500 for a 12-week course. It will cover Sovaldi in cases where patients have other types of the disease. The AbbVie regimen is also not recommended for patients whose livers are not functioning and in people who have not benefited from using older treatments. An Express Scripts spokesman said the company will make exceptions for those patients to allow them to take Gilead’s medications. Mario Molina, chief executive officer of Molina Healthcare Inc., a small Medicaid insurer in California that has criticized Gilead’s high prices, said on Monday that he sees more competition on drug prices ahead. “I think that this is the beginning,” Molina said, describing the move as “a harbinger of things to come.”   (Reporting by Caroline Humer; Editing by Michele Gershberg, Meredith Mazzilli and Dan Grebler)",12222014,http://www.reuters.com/article/express-scripts-abbvie-hepatitisc/update-3-express-scripts-drops-gilead-hep-c-drugs-for-cheaper-abbvie-rival-idUSL1N0U61N420141222

222,ABBV,Achillion data shows promise of shorter-duration hep C treatment,"(Reuters) - Data from Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc’s hepatitis C drug trials showed the company could develop a shorter-duration treatment rivaling offerings from Gilead Sciences Inc and Abbvie Inc. The company said on Monday it would test a combination of two of its experimental hepatitis C drugs after they showed promise against the virus in separate studies. The biotechnology company’s shares rose as much as 17 percent to $16.77, their highest in more than seven years. Data from the first study, testing a combination of Achillion’s NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, and Gilead’s blockbuster Sovaldi, showed signs that the virus disappeared within four weeks, following a six-week course of therapy.  Gilead’s Harvoni, which combines Sovaldi with the company’s own NS5A inhibitor, achieves this response only after eight weeks of therapy. The main goal of Achillion’s ongoing mid-stage study is to achieve a sustained virological response 12 weeks after therapy that would constitute a cure. The market for hepatitis C drugs has developed at a lightening pace in recent years, with several companies working on producing newer drugs to treat the disease that affects about 150 million around the world. The U.S. health regulator on Friday approved Abbvie’s hep C cocktail.  In a separate early-stage study, Achillion’s nucleotide inhibitor, ACH-3422, also demonstrated potent antiviral activity. William Blair’s Katherine Xu said the company’s ACH-3422 was slower to exert its effects than Sovaldi, adding that its nucleotide inhibitor needs to be equally effective for Achillion to attract takeover interest. Achillion, one of the few companies developing hepatitis C drugs independently, said it planned to start mid-stage studies to evaluate the combination next year. Wells Fargo’s Brian Abrahams said an all-Achillion combination could still have an edge over competition as ACH-3102’s high barrier to resistance will offset ACH-3422’s slower effect.

Gilead Sciences slumped 9.9 percent to $97.71 as the biggest drag on both the S&P; and Nasdaq 100 indexes. Express Scripts, the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, has lined up a cheaper price from AbbVie Inc  for its newly approved hepatitis C treatment and, in most cases, will no longer cover Gilead’s treatments. “That is very specific to Gilead, so that one is getting crushed, but it shouldn’t necessarily set a completely negative tone over the rest of the market, there is no reason for it,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. “The market has had a decent move the last couple of days, so anything could cause people to take a little money off the table.” The benchmark S&P; index rose 3.4 percent last week, boosted by a 5 percent jump over three sessions, after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would take a “patient” approach toward raising interest rates and oil prices appeared to stabilize. The S&P; energy index surged nearly 10 percent for the week. Brent crude hit a high of $62.97 and WTI crude rose to as much as $58.53 but reversed gains and turned lower after Saudi Arabia indicated it could increase its output.

225,ABBV,CVS to cover Gilead hepatitis C treatment over AbbVie regimen,"(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp, one of the largest U.S. managers of drug benefits, said it would give preferred status to the hepatitis C treatments from Gilead Sciences and cover a new competing treatment from AbbVie Inc only as an exception. The latest salvo in the battle to grab market share for new all-oral treatments for the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus follows a move last month by CVS rival Express Scripts Holding that favored AbbVie’s regimen after negotiating a price discount below what Gilead had been charging its commercial customers. Express Scripts, the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, said it would cover AbbVie’s Viekira Pak and exclude Gilead’s Sovaldi and combination drug Harvoni. The decision had sent Gilead shares sharply lower at the time. On Monday, Gilead shares were up 2.5 percent following the CVS announcement, while AbbVie shares were down 2.2 percent. Gilead has come under intense criticism for the high price of its first-to-market all-oral treatment; Sovaldi costs about $1,000 per pill. Harvoni combines Sovaldi with another drug into a one-pill, once-a-day treatment with cure rates well above 90 percent. A 12-week course of treatment with Harvoni costs about $93,500, although some patients may need just eights weeks of therapy costing about $63,000. It was not yet known whether Gilead agreed to a substantially discounted price to secure CVS coverage. Gilead did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Express Scripts said it is still negotiating with Gilead on behalf of its plans. “Our actions have changed how pharmaceutical innovation will be rewarded in the future,”  spokesman Brian Henry said.  RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said the CVS move “removes near-term uncertainty for many investors who feared CVS would also strike a deal with AbbVie and put more pressure on Gilead.” AbbVie declined to say whether it was still in talks with CVS. CVS said the Gilead drugs would be exclusive on its standard commercial formulary, as well as those for exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act, Medicare Part D and Medicaid. “Our goal was to create the lowest net-cost solution for the entire population of patients with all genotypes of hepatitis C,” CVS spokeswoman Christine Cramer said in a statement. The recently approved AbbVie regimen has similarly high cure rates, but involves more drugs and pills per day. Many patients must also take the older drug ribavirin, which can cause anemia and other side effects. Gilead shares were up $2.28 at $97.19, while AbbVie shares were down $1.45 at $64.44.

235,ABBV,Exclusive: Hedge fund Mason Capital ends 2014 down 12 percent - source,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund Mason Capital lost 12 percent in 2014, making for one of the industry’s biggest declines, after the New York-based firm was hit by a failed merger of pharmaceuticals companies Shire and AbbVie, a person familiar with the firm said in Monday. The $9 billion hedge fund, which manages money for state pension funds and other wealthy investors, sold depressed Shire shares after the two companies called off their planned deal in October, the source said. The shares later rebounded.  Mason ended October down 7 percent. In November, when many hedge funds recovered, it was nearly flat, gaining just 0.03 percent as a number of energy stocks in its portfolio were hit by falling oil prices. The average hedge fund gained 3.57 percent last year, data from research firm Hedge Fund Research show. One of Mason’s clients is the state of Rhode Island’s pension fund. According to the state’s data, Mason Capital was its worst-performing global equity hedge fund in the last five years, even though it boasted a 22.8 percent return in 2013. Shire has since agreed to buy U.S. group NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc for $5.2 billion, the Dublin-based drugmaker’ s biggest acquisition yet, as it seeks to strengthen its position in the lucrative field of medicines for rare diseases.

236,ABBV,AbbVie wins U.S. approval for Parkinson's treatment,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved AbbVie Inc’s treatment for Parkinson’s disease. The treatment, Duopa — a combination of carbidopa and levodopa — is the first to be effective for 16 hours, compared with existing oral formulations that last for up to four hours following a single dose.  Duopa, already available in Canada, is administered using a small portable infusion pump that delivers the drug directly to the small intestine. AbbVie shares were up 1 percent in premarket trading. Parkinson’s disease is characterized by reduced levels of the hormone dopamine in the brain, which leads to poor mobility, slowness and stiffness. Nearly all patients diagnosed with the disease are treated with levodopa. The effectiveness of oral levodopa, however, is limited by its short half-life. Excessive oral doses often lead to involuntary movements, or dyskinesia. Last week, the FDA approved Impax Laboratories Inc’s Parkinson’s drug, Rytary, after rejecting it twice. Other companies developing drugs for the disease include NeuroDerm Ltd, Acorda Therapeutics Inc and Cynapsus Therapeutics. About 1 million Americans live with Parkinson’s disease — more than the number of people diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and Lou Gehrig’s disease combined, according to the Parkinson’s Disease Foundation.

240,ABBV,"Gilead, AbbVie hit by fresh concerns on Hep C discounting","(Reuters) - Shares of Gilead Sciences Inc closed down 6 percent on Tuesday, after a pharmacy benefit manager said it would cover both Gilead and rival AbbVie Inc’s hepatitis C offering, renewing concerns of pricing pressure. Investors interpreted this as further discounting of hep C drugs, signaled by an increasing willingness by drugmakers to offer rebates, Sanford Bernstein’s Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note. Express Scripts, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, dropped Gilead’s hep C drugs in December in favor of AbbVie’s newly approved alternative at a cheaper price. Meanwhile, CVS Health Corp, the second-largest pharmacy benefit manager, and health insurer Anthem Inc inked deals with Gilead to cover Harvoni. On Monday, St. Paul, Minnesota-based pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics LLC, which serves over 25 million people, said it would cover both Gilead’s Harvoni and AbbVie’s Viekira Pak.  “There has been a substantial reduction in the net price of both of these drugs just in the past few weeks, so sometimes it pays not to go first,” said Peter Wickersham, Prime’s senior vice president of Integrated Care and Specialty. While exact rebate rates will unlikely be disclosed we would hesitate to read too much into the claims from Prime, and we do not believe they alter expectations about hep C pricing, Porges said. “It is possible that neither Gilead nor AbbVie felt the need to offer a deep rebate to Prime for exclusivity.” Prime is not known for exclusionary formularies in contrast with CVS and Express Scripts, and consequently, both drugmakers may have been less pressured with Prime than they were with CVS and Express Scripts, he said.  AbbVie’s shares closed down 3.6 percent on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

Express Scripts was able to secure a discount that has brought the AbbVie price down to Western European levels for Gilead’s hepatitis C treatment, Chief Medical Officer Steven Miller told Reuters. Such prices overseas range from about $51,000 to $66,000.  The gap in price between Harvoni and Viekira has stayed about the same as both have fallen, Miller said. The dynamic will save Express Scripts customers $1 billion in 2015, with a total of $4 billion in savings across the United States when all payers and employers are included, Miller said. He expects over 170,000 people will be treated for the liver-destroying virus in the United States in 2015, up from 100,000 last year. “This is the first time in the history of the pharmaceutical industry that someone has been able to create a price war,” Miller said in an interview.  Gilead set off a national debate about the affordability of drugs last year after it priced its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi at $84,000 per treatment, or about $1,000 per pill. That drug has been followed by a combination pill that is more expensive called Harvoni.   An estimated 3.2 million people in America have the virus, and many health insurers and payers said the cost of treating all of them would be unaffordable. Express Scripts Holding Co, the nation’s largest pharmacy benefits manager, has been the most vocal critic of Gilead for its pricing. When U.S. health regulators approved AbbVie’s Viekira Pak in late December, Express Scripts announced within days that it was dropping coverage of Gilead’s treatments from its largest list of reimbursable drugs, except under certain medical exceptions.  Express Scripts and its clients are reaping new savings as prices head lower from both Gilead and AbbVie, but that will not change Harvoni’s place on its reimbursement list in the near future. “They cannot buy their way back onto the national preferred formulary at this time,” Miller said of Gilead. Express Scripts’ agreement with AbbVie spans multiple years but Miller declined to say how many. Beyond hepatitis C, other drugmakers are showing much more willingness to discuss pricing early on in the development of new treatments, Miller said. That includes more detailed talks on how many patients would most benefit from a new therapy. The industry is closely watching two new areas to see how the pricing dynamics will play out - PCSK9s for high cholesterol and PD-1s for cancer.  “More companies are coming to us, telling us about their pipeline and wanting to know what kind of data we want to see,” Miller said.

242,ABBV,PBM EnvisionRx chooses Gilead hepatitis C drugs for its formulary,"(Reuters) - Pharmacy benefits manager EnvisionRx said on Monday it reached an agreement to provide its customers with Gilead Sciences Inc’s hepatitis C drugs on an exclusive basis, the latest Gilead victory in a market share battle with AbbVie over their new treatments for the liver destroying virus. EnvisionRx said Gilead’s Sovaldi and its newer two-drug combination pill Harvoni would be available on its formulary, with other hepatitis C drugs, such as AbbVie’s Viekira Pak, allowed only as an exception in some cases. It was not disclosed how much of a price discount EnvisionRx negotiated from Gilead to secure the agreement. “The safety and efficacy profile of Gilead’s HCV products, coupled with the most competitive pricing in the drug class, have solidified EnvisionRx’s choice to place Gilead’s products in an exclusive and preferred formulary position,” said EnvisionRx President Dawn Sherman in a statement. Express Scripts Holding, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) which had complained about the high cost of Gilead’s first to market treatment, fired the first shot in the hepatitis C price war days after the AbbVie rival treatment was approved. It gave Viekira Pak preference on its formulary, excluding Gilead’s drugs. Gilead then locked up formulary exclusivity for Harvoni with CVS Health, the second largest U.S. PBM. PBMs negotiate drug pricing for employers and health plans. Health insurers have also chosen sides after negotiating their own discount deals following the Express Scripts move. Aetna, Anthem and Humana chose Gilead drugs as their preferred treatment, while PBM Prime Therapeutics kept both on its list. Both treatments have demonstrated an ability to cure well over 90 percent of patients, although Gilead’s Harvoni involves fewer drugs than Viekira. Harvoni, which combines Sovaldi with another drug, has a list price of $94,500 for 12 weeks of treatment. Viekira Pak  was listed at about $83,300.  Analysts believe the companies have been providing discounts of up to 30 percent, although the specific negotiated rebates have not been disclosed. EnvisionRx provides services for Medicare Part D plans as well as government paid or subsidized insurance through Medicaid, CHIP and individual exchange plans.

244,ABBV,UnitedHealth backs Gilead's Harvoni as preferred hepatitis C treatment,"(Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc, the largest U.S. health insurer, on Wednesday backed Gilead Sciences Inc’s Harvoni as the preferred hepatitis C treatment on its 2015 commercial drug coverage list, another victory for Gilead over competitor AbbVie Inc. Gilead and AbbVie have been battling for hepatitis C market share since the approval in December for an AbbVie drug that challenges Gilead’s blockbusters. Insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have been striking deals for preferred or exclusive status in exchange for discounts for 2015. UnitedHealth’s drug coverage list, which is effective Feb. 1, applies to all of the company’s commercial, fully insured customers who use its Optum RX pharmacy benefit manager and self-insured customers such as large employers who follow the drug list. The update to the formulary, available on the company’s website, also applies to its Medicaid, Medicare and military contracts.  “We are constantly working to deliver value and manage costs for customers and consumers throughout our business,” UnitedHealth spokesman Tyler Mason said in a statement. Gilead declined to comment.  Gilead set off a firestorm last year when it launched a breakthrough treatment for hepatitis C called Sovaldi that carries an $84,000-per-treatment price tag. Insurers, including UnitedHealth, were taken by surprise by its cost and called it out as an unexpected hit to profits last year.  Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit manager, pushed back against the price of Sovaldi and Gilead’s follow-up drug Harvoni, which has a list price of $93,400. It backed AbbVie’s Viekira Pak, saying it had gotten a significant discount. Analysts and investors say the treatments are being discounted by at least 30 percent. The companies have declined to comment. UnitedHealth is the last of the top three U.S. insurers to strike a deal with either Gilead or AbbVie. Reuters reported two weeks ago that Aetna Inc had backed Gilead, as have Anthem Inc and Humana Inc. Pharmacy benefit manager CVS Health also went with Gilead while smaller competitor Prime Therapeutics kept both on its list. The state of Missouri earlier this week said it had selected AbbVie’s Viekira Pak for Medicaid patients who meet certain criteria, and said the agreement would reduce treatment costs by 30 to 40 percent. UnitedHealth has 45 million medical customers. Of those, 18 million are employed by companies that are self-insured and use UnitedHealth to administer their plan benefits; not all those employers follow UnitedHealth’s commercial drug guideline or use UnitedHealth for their drug benefits.

247,ABBV,UPDATE 2-AbbVie expects hep C drug sales to top $3 billion per year,"(Adds analyst comment) By Bill Berkrot Jan 30 (Reuters) - AbbVie Inc’s chief executive said on Friday the company’s new oral hepatitis C treatment Viekira Pak has the potential to capture a “meaningful share” of the U.S. market, where it is competing against Gilead Sciences . AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez told investors the company expects an annualized sales run rate of more than $3 billion by the end of 2015, which could grow as more countries begin using Viekira Pak. “We expect it to remain a large and attractive opportunity for many years to come,” Gonzalez said. AbbVie shares fell 3.6 percent to $60.85 as investors were disappointed by the Viekira forecast. “It was carefully worded in the most optimistic way possible,” BMO analyst Alex Arfaei said. An exit rate of above $3 billion in 2015, “indicates that sales in 2015 will be below $3 billion.” With Merck expected to launch its rival treatment in 2016, he said, “we expect additional price competition in this market.” Some analysts have forecast annual Gilead hepatitis C sales in excess of $15 billion. AbbVie and Gilead have been competing to nail down managed care contracts since Viekira Pak’s December U.S. approval after Express Scripts Holding, the largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), negotiated a lower price from AbbVie and excluded Gilead’s hepatitis treatments from its list of covered drugs. Gilead came under intense criticism for the $84,000 cost of its Sovaldi hepatitis C treatment and more expensive Harvoni combination pill. CVS Health, the second largest PBM, and the largest health insurers have since chosen Gilead’s drugs for preferential coverage. AbbVie said more than 40 percent of people who receive insurance coverage from a managed care company, such as CVS or Aetna, will have access to Viekira Pak, including 20 percent with exclusive coverage. More than half of all U.S. managed care lives are now under contract, Gonzalez estimated. He said AbbVie was working on several contracts expected to be finalized within 30 days. “Up to this point we are pleased with our formulary position and we believe we have the potential to capture meaningful share of the U.S. HCV market,” he added. Analysts have estimated that discounts offered for preferred drug status have exceeded 30 percent off list price. AbbVie declined to disclose details of its contracts. “We priced and rebated consistent with the value of our product and what we thought was appropriate for the market,” Gonzalez said. He said AbbVie offered the greatest discounts to plans willing to allow Viekira access to patients regardless of  severity of their liver damage. The company said 1,100 Viekira prescriptions were written through Jan. 16. It reported $48 million in Viekira sales in December, largely from inventory stocking.

251,ABBV,UPDATE 1-Drugmaker AbbVie beats estimates as Humira sales rise,"(Adds forecast, background) Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc’s  revenue beat analysts’ estimates for the fourth straight quarter as sales of arthritis drug Humira jumped nearly 11 percent. The company, however, reported a net loss of $810 million, or 51 cents per share, for the fourth quarter, mainly due to a charge related to its aborted $55 billion deal to buy British drugmaker Shire Plc. Excluding the charge and other special items, AbbVie earned 89 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 86 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 6.7 percent to $5.45 billion, above the average analyst estimate of $5.36 billion. Sales of Humira, which AbbVie inherited from Abbott Laboratories in 2013, rose to $3.36 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. AbbVie kept its 2015 forecast from Jan. 8 unchanged. The company expects 2015 earnings of $4.25-$4.45 per share, up sharply from last year’s $3.32 per share, citing demand for its all-oral Viekira Pak hepatitis C treatment and growing sales of Humira. Analysts expect Viekira Pak, approved by U.S. regulators in December, to eventually command about 25 percent of the lucrative hepatitis C market. The drug competes with Gilead Sciences Inc’s  Harvoni, a combination pill that has a list price of $93,400 for 12 weeks of treatment.

256,ABBV,UPDATE 2-Promising data bodes well for all-Achillion hep C treatment,"* Study shows Achillion’s inhibitor looks best-in-class: analyst * All-Achillion combination could rival Gilead, AbbVie treatments * Achillion to begin testing its own combination this year * Shares rise as much as 19 pct   (Adds detail, analyst comment; updates shares) By Natalie Grover Feb 9 (Reuters) - Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc’s experimental hepatitis C drug, when used with Gilead Sciences Inc’s Sovaldi, eradicated signs of the virus in six weeks, the shortest duration and highest response achieved by any two-drug treatment. Achillion’s shares rose as much as 19 percent to $12.85 on Monday on investor’s hopes that an all-Achillion combination could be as effective as Gilead’s and AbbVie Inc’s current therapies. The estimated $20 billion market for hepatitis C drugs has developed at a lightning pace in recent years, with several companies including Gilead, AbbVie and Merck & Co Inc  working on faster, more potent ways to cure the liver-destroying virus, which affects more than 170 million globally. The new-generation hepatitis C regimens use a two- to three-drug combination - a nucleotide analog inhibitor or “nuke” and a NS5A inhibitor in Gilead’s case - to achieves a cure in about eight to 12 weeks, making them faster and more effective than older treatment options. Gilead’s regimen Harvoni, with its own NS5A inhibitor and Sovaldi as the “nuke”, needs to be taken for at least eight weeks. Launched in October, its sales touched $2.11 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31. AbbVie’s three-drug cocktail Viekira Pak, which won U.S. approval in December, must be taken for at least 12 weeks. Achillion’s ongoing mid-stage study tests its NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, with Sovaldi in previously untreated genotype 1 hepatitis C patients over six and eight weeks of therapy. The main goal is to achieve a cure, or sustained virological response, 12 weeks after the completion of therapy. Monday’s data shows Achillion’s NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, looks best-in-class, which could make up for its nuke, ACH-3422, being perhaps less effective than Sovaldi, analysts said. The question then becomes whether ACH-3422 plus ACH-3102 - a weaker nuke and a stronger NS5A inhibitor - could be a good enough doublet as Harvoni, William Blair’s Katherine Xu said. Achillion, one of the few companies developing hepatitis C therapies independently, plans to begin a mid-stage study this year to evaluate its proprietary doublet. The all-Achillion regimen could hit the U.S. market by 2020 in a conservative scenario, Deutsche Bank’s Alethia Young estimated. She expects the treatment to cost about $35,000 per patient per year, assuming a 55 percent discount. Harvoni’s list price is $93,400 and Viekira Pak is estimated to cost $83,319.

257,ABBV,AbbVie boosts cancer drug pipeline with $21 billion Pharmacyclics deal,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) is to buy Pharmacyclics Inc PCYC.O for about $21 billion, giving it access to what is expected to be one of the world’s top-selling cancer drugs and expanding its reach in the profitable oncology field. The deal — the latest example of a big drugmaker swooping on a biotech firm to refill its medicine pipeline — confounds expectations that Pharmacyclics would sell out to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N). AbbVie will pay $261.25 per share in cash and stock, a 13 percent premium to Pharmacyclics stock’s closing price on Wednesday. Back in 2008 and 2009, the shares dipped below $1. The acquisition lessens Chicago-based AbbVie’s dependence on its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira that accounts for most of its revenue but is expected to start to see sales decline from 2017 or 2018. AbbVie failed last October to buy Dublin-based Shire Plc (SHP.L) for $55 billion after the United States took steps to deter such tax-lowering deals. Deutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas said the deal was positive for AbbVie as Pharmacyclics’ blood cancer treatment Imbruvica would diversify the business beyond Humira. “Imbruvica is not only complementary to AbbVie’s oncology pipeline, it has demonstrated strong clinical efficacy across a broad range of hematologic malignancies,” AbbVie Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez said in a statement. Pharmacyclics expects U.S. sales of Imbruvica to hit $1 billion this year and by 2020 worldwide sales are forecast to reach $5.8 billion, according to consensus analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters Cortellis. AbbVie, which was spun out of Abbott Laboratories in 2013, said the deal would be “highly accretive” to its revenue and earnings by 2017. Sunnyvale, California-based Pharmacyclics co-markets Imbruvica with Johnson & Johnson. Besides Imbruvica, it has three product candidates in development. In a statement, J&J; said: “We’re looking forward to continuing our collaboration with the team at AbbVie to further develop and commercialize this important therapy for patients and their health care teams.” Media reports had said J&J; was close to buying Pharmacyclics.

258,ABBV,AbbVie CEO defends Pharmacyclics deal to skeptical investors,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - AbbVie Inc chief Richard Gonzalez fought two other drugmakers to “the bitter end” to buy Pharmacyclics Inc PCYC.O for its hot-selling Imbruvica cancer drug, but may have a harder time convincing investors it is worth $21 billion. Gonzalez, who took over as chief executive in early 2013, has come under closer scrutiny after AbbVie (ABBV.N) abandoned a $55 billion deal to purchase Shire Plc (SHP.L) last year due to new U.S. tax rules that wiped out much of the deal’s rationale.  Since then, some shareholders have questioned how the company will protect its best-selling drug Humira, for arthritis, against new rivals when it loses patent protection in late 2016. Others have criticized steep discounts AbbVie has offered on its new hepatitis C drug, to win coverage from U.S. health insurers. AbbVie announced the Pharmacyclics deal late on Wednesday, saying it would hurt company earnings this year and next, then boost profits from 2017 and beyond. Company shares fell almost 6 percent.  “AbbVie is taking a hit today because of the dilution and because they look a little desperate to do a deal,” said Chris Pultz, portfolio manager for Kellner Merger Fund, an arbitrage fund that took a stake in Pharmacyclics on Thursday. “AbbVie lost a little credibility” by paying top dollar for Pharmacyclics, he said.     In a conference call, Gonzalez said Imbruvica will eventually bring the company $7 billion in annual sales - ahead of some Wall Street estimates - and boost a pipeline of experimental cancer drugs that AbbVie hopes will be worth more than $8 billion in combined sales each year. That made it worth fighting for Pharmacyclics, he said. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), a partner in developing Imbruvica, was widely reported as a second bidder, while the identity of a third suitor has not been confirmed. “It was a highly competitive multi-round process,” Gonzalez told Reuters. “We bid against two large, sophisticated pharmaceutical companies. And when disclosures come out, you’ll see the spread (between bids). I don’t think we’ll look embarrassed.” Gonzalez said AbbVie became interested in Pharmacyclics about 18 months ago, but didn’t actively pursue a deal until being informed in recent months that AbbVie was on a short list of favored suitors.  Gonzalez met with Pharmacyclics CEO Bob Duggan in January, followed by three other trips to California’s Bay Area, where the company is based. Bidding began about two weeks ago, he said. Gonzalez said Imbruvica would make AbbVie less reliant on Humira, a $13-billion-a-year blockbuster. AbbVie said it has also sought U.S. and European marketing approvals for an improved formulation that could battle cheaper biosimilar forms of Humira. “It’s a fundamental change in the formulation of Humira,” Gonzalez said in an interview. “I wouldn’t describe it as a tweak.” Asked if AbbVie intends to switch over current Humira patients to the new formulation, Gonzalez said such a strategy would make sense.  Citigroup analyst Andrew Baum wrote in a research note that the new version of Humira would likely have an auto-injector that would cause less pain than regular needles and might not need refrigeration. Such improvements, he said, could lead 20 percent of current Humira patients to switch to the new product.

The S&P; and the Dow hit records and the Nasdaq surpassed 5,000 at the start of the week after a strong February performance for U.S. stocks. “People are taking a wait-and-see approach ahead of the jobs report,” said Paul Brigandi, managing director of portfolio management at Direxion Funds in New York. European news was some help to U.S. markets on Thursday but higher-than-expected U.S. jobless claims took “a little bit of the wind out of the sails,” Brigandi said. Initial jobless claims rose to 320,000 in the latest week, above the 295,000 estimate. The disappointing numbers came after a weaker-than-expected private payrolls report on Wednesday and ahead of Friday’s monthly employment report. A separate report showed new orders for U.S. factory goods unexpectedly fell in January for a sixth month, a sign of weakness in the manufacturing sector. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 36.89 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,133.79, the S&P; 500 gained 3.84 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,102.37 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 19.32 points, or 0.39 percent, to 4,986.46. Earlier in the day, the European Central Bank raised growth and inflation targets and announced it would start its new government bond-buying program of 60 billion euros a month on March 9. Healthcare stocks helped the S&P; 500 stay positive in the late afternoon. Biogen Idec rose 2.4 percent to $424.24.

The deal — the latest example of a big drugmaker swooping on a biotech firm to refill its medicine pipeline — confounds expectations that Pharmacyclics would sell out to Johnson & Johnson. AbbVie will pay $261.25 per share in cash and stock, a 13 percent premium to Pharmacyclics stock’s closing price on Wednesday. Back in 2008 and 2009, the shares dipped below $1. The acquisition lessens Chicago-based AbbVie’s dependence on its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira that accounts for most of its revenue but is expected to start to see sales decline from 2017 or 2018. AbbVie failed last October to buy Dublin-based Shire Plc  for $55 billion after the United States took steps to deter such tax-lowering deals. Deutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas said the deal was positive for AbbVie as Pharmacyclics’ blood cancer treatment Imbruvica would diversify the business beyond Humira. “Imbruvica is not only complementary to AbbVie’s oncology pipeline, it has demonstrated strong clinical efficacy across a broad range of hematologic malignancies,” AbbVie Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez said in a statement. Pharmacyclics expects U.S. sales of Imbruvica to hit $1 billion this year and by 2020 worldwide sales are forecast to reach $5.8 billion, according to consensus analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters Cortellis. AbbVie, which was spun out of Abbott Laboratories in 2013, said the deal would be “highly accretive” to its revenue and earnings by 2017. Sunnyvale, California-based Pharmacyclics co-markets Imbruvica with Johnson & Johnson. Besides Imbruvica, it has three product candidates in development. In a statement, J&J; said: “We’re looking forward to continuing our collaboration with the team at AbbVie to further develop and commercialize this important therapy for patients and their health care teams.” Media reports had said J&J; was close to buying Pharmacyclics.

Initial jobless claims rose to 320,000 in the latest week, above the 295,000 estimate and 313,000 in the prior week. The disappointing claims numbers come after a weaker-than-expected private payrolls report on Wednesday and ahead of Friday’s monthly employment report. Investors were looking ahead to the jobs report due out on Friday to help them assess the timing of the Fed’s first interest rate hike in years, said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners, in Chicago. “We’re kind of tapping our foot for tomorrow’s non-farm payroll,” said Battle. “The Federal Reserve made it very clear they’re going to raise rates but its going to be data dependent. It’s one of the benchmark numbers they’re looking at.” At 12:50 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.85 points, or 0.07 percent, to 18,108.75, the S&P; 500  lost 1.64 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,096.89 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.99 points, or 0.02 percent, to 4,968.13. A separate report showed new orders for U.S. factory goods unexpectedly fell in January for a sixth month, a sign of weakness in the manufacturing sector. As investors attempt to speculate on the timing of the Fed’s impending rate increase, the equity market’s advance has slowed since the March 2 highs for both the Dow and S&P; 500, with each index down 0.9 percent. “There is nothing really to drive sentiment one way or the other that is going to change people’s perceptions on anything at the moment so therefore you are just getting this churning back and forth,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. AbbVie is to buy Pharmacyclics for about $21 billion, giving it access to what is expected to be one of the world’s top-selling cancer drugs and expanding its reach in the profitable oncology field.

267,ABBV,TRLPC: Abbvie and NXP boost M&A; volumes,"NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - The loan market received another boost this week as drugmaker Abbvie and semiconductor company NXP boosted U.S. M&A; volume to $152.7 billion so far this year, including completed and deals in the pipeline. On the investment grade side, AbbVie is leading the charge backing its $21 billion acquisition of Pharmacyclics with an $18 billion 364-day senior unsecured bridge loan from Morgan Stanley and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. The bridge loan, which is the largest financing so far this year, is in the market and is expected to be syndicated among the company’s relationship banks. “It seems that most of the activity has been on investment grade as opposed to non-investment grade,” a banker said. “The capacity for investment grade is bigger particularly with the regulatory overhaul that’s been going on.” Frontier Communications has lined up the second-biggest financing with an $11.6 billion bridge loan to fund its $10.5 billion acquisition of wireline assets from Verizon. The two deals have helped push investment grade M&A; deal volume to $47 billion in 2015. The Abbvie bridge loan will fund the cash component of the acquisition alongside cash on AbbVie’s balance sheet. The deal is expected to be replaced with bonds only. “Healthcare continues to be a hot sector. The Abbvie deal speaks to capacity for acquisition financing. It’s a robust market for these type of deals,” a second banker said. AbbVie, rated A by Standard & Poor’s and Baa1 by Moody’s, will pay $261.25 per share in cash and stock, a 13 percent premium to Pharmacyclics stock’s closing price on March 4. Under the acquisition, Pharmacyclics shareholders have the option to be paid 100 percent cash, 100 percent stock or a mix of cash and stock. Leveraged lift NXP is separately backing its up to $40 billion merger with U.S.-based Freescale with $7 billion of loans, which have pushed leveraged M&A; loan volume to $70 billion this year. The loans include a $3.25 billion five-year Term Loan B1 initially paying 325bp over Libor, stepping down to 300bp for net leverage of 2.0 times; a $3.25 billion seven-year Term Loan B2 initially paying 350bp over Libor, stepping down to 325bp for leverage of 2.0 times. There is also an up to $500 million five-year super senior revolver paying 200bp over Libor, stepping down to 175bp for leverage of 2.0 times and to 150bp for leverage of 1.5 times. The revolver also pays a 25bp commitment fee on undrawn amounts. Lead arranger and bookrunner Credit Suisse has initially committed 100 percent of the term loans and $112.5 million of the revolver. The term loans will be used to pay the cash consideration of the offer, refinance Freescale’s existing credit facility, and backstop a consent process on Freescale’s existing bonds. The revolver will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The acquisition price puts Freescale’s value at $11.8 billion, with a total enterprise value of $16.7 billion including debt. The companies said that they would finance the merger with $1 billion of cash on hand, $1 billion of new debt and around 115m of NXP ordinary shares. NXP is rated BB+ by Standard & Poor’s and Ba2 by Moody’s.

268,ABBV,Pharmacyclics cancer drug successful as combination therapy: independent panel,"(Reuters) - An independent panel recommended unblinding a late-stage study testing Pharmacyclics Inc and Johnson & Johnson’s Imbruvica, after the treatment was successful against two similar forms of cancer in combination with other drugs. Pharmacyclics, which recently agreed to be acquired by AbbVie Inc for about $21 billion, said Imbruvica showed a statistically significant improvement in survival without disease progression, the study’s main goal. Pharmacyclics’ shares closed up about 0.7 percent on Monday, while AbbVie’s stock closed up about 2 percent. Imbruvica, which is co-marketed by Pharmacyclics and J&J;, is already approved for four cancer indications in the United States. The study is testing Imbruvica in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (BR), against a placebo in combination with BR, in 578 previously treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Imbruvica is already approved for CLL patients who have had at least one prior therapy. Detailed results of the study will be submitted to health authorities for future labeling considerations, Pharmacyclics said. The company has forecast U.S. sales of Imbruvica to hit $1 billion this year. Worldwide sales are forecast to reach $5.8 billion by 2020, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters Cortellis.

273,ABBV,Borrowers warned: Don't be fooled by high grade market resilience,"NEW YORK, May 11 (IFR) - Apple, Shell and AbbVie blitzed the US bond market last week with a combined US$34bn of jumbo bond deals in just two days, bringing the week’s tally to US$52bn, the fourth-largest of all time. AbbVie issued US$16.7bn to finance its acquisition of Pharmacyclics - it was the sixth-biggest bond deal ever - after attracting US$60bn of demand. The next day Apple issued US$8bn on US$21bn of demand and Shell US$10bn on US$23bn of orders. But bankers are warning borrowers planning to raise some US$80bn or more in May not to be dazzled by the US market’s seeming resilience. New-issue concessions have bulged in the past week after wild swings in 10 and 30-year Treasuries and huge supply took their toll. Now there are fears that the bond market has reached a tipping point, and corporates may face rising funding costs from here on. “The real risk to the market over the course of a busy May for new issues is extreme volatility in Treasuries,” said Jonny Fine, head of investment-grade debt syndicate in the Americas at Goldman Sachs. “We have gone from new-issue concessions of zero to 5bp in March to a weaker environment where NICs are 10bp-15bp. In the same period credit spreads have widened a little and Treasuries have increased a lot, so all-in costs of debt issuance have deteriorated.” The new-issue market has been able to recover from temporary gluts at various times this year. And, in the absence of Treasury volatility, it only took a few slow weeks to bring concessions snapping back in. Now, although investors still have cash to put to work, not knowing where rates are heading requires higher concessions, especially at the long end of the curve. It was no coincidence, then, that Apple paid 10bp in NICs and Shell 11bp-16bp on the day the 30-year Treasury yield pierced the 3% mark for the first time since December. With European government bonds backing up dramatically, commodity prices stabilising and US economic growth expected to improve, some think the Treasury market is undergoing a fundamental shift away from curve flattening, towards a period of steepening at the long end. “Many former entrenched trends are now over and the new long-term trends have begun,” said William O’Donnell, head of US Treasury strategy at Royal Bank of Scotland. “We are going through the earliest phase of a ‘term-risk tantrum’. What we have witnessed since the end of March is markets coming to grips with ongoing improvement in the US economy and maybe a nascent recovery out of Europe at a time when we are staring at record low European and US yields. It’s making people have a complete re-think.” Fed Chair Janet Yellen also made comments during the week that bolstered that view. “She sent a signal to the market that stocks have gone too high and bond yields are too low at a time when the Fed could raise rates in September,” said O’Donnell. Although yields tightened on Thursday, the wild swings saw issuers such as Anglo American pay new-issue premiums of as much as 19bp and most other borrowers that day paid double-digit concessions across maturities. Matters will be made worse by the illiquidity in the secondary market. “Larger new-issue premiums impact future bond pricing to a greater extent than we have seen in the past, due to the illiquidity in the secondary market,” said Michael Shapiro, manager on Societe Generale’s US bond syndicate. “The existing secondary curve can widen because of a larger new-issue premium and the result is wider pricing points when an issuer or one of its peers seeks to return to the market.” Borrowers are also likely to find that they can no longer determine what they will pay in the bond market based on what others are achieving. “There have been times when the concessions that various credits in different sectors paid have been uniform, but this is not one of those environments,” said Fine. “It’s more critical than at any other time for syndicate managers to really understand the difference between individual credits and sectors and how they are likely to be accepted by the bond market versus others.” Strong order books, however, have shown that demand is still there. And bankers and issuers hope that any reduction of demand for bonds from retail investors (put off by the damage done by wider Treasury yields to total returns) will be offset by insurance companies and pension funds coming in for higher-yielding paper.

274,ABBV,AbbVie hepatitis C cocktail succeeds in late-stage study,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc said on Wednesday that its hepatitis C cocktail Viekira Pak was effective whether or not it was used in combination with the compound ribavirin against the most common form of the disease, according to data from a late-stage study.

278,ABBV,"AbbVie, Bristol-Myers get FDA nod for hep C treatments","(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved two treatments for less common forms of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. The regulator cleared AbbVie Inc’s Technivie, which targets HCV genotype 4 infections, and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s Daklinza, used to treat HCV genotype 3 infections. About 2.7 million Americans are infected with HCV, of which 10 percent are genotype 3. Genotype 4 is considered among the least common, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Both treatments do not require the co-administration of older antivirals, the regulator said. The viral disease causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to diminished function or failure of the organ. Technivie comprises three drugs that are included in Viekira Pak, AbbVie's regimen for the most common form of HCV infection - genotype 1. (1.usa.gov/1gSuFvU) Technivie is the first regimen approved to safely and effectively treat genotype 4, while Daklinza is the first for genotype 3, the FDA said. The regulator has approved the use of Daklinza in combination with Gilead Sciences Inc's Sovaldi.

280,ABBV,AbbVie's revenue miss raises concerns over Humira sales,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) reported quarterly revenue that missed analysts’ estimates for the first time in six quarters, sparking concerns over slowing sales growth for its flagship arthritis drug, Humira. The company’s shares fell as much as 4.5 percent on Friday. AbbVie reported total Humira sales of $3.54 billion for the quarter ended June 30, a 7.6 percent fall from a year earlier. Humira sales have grown on an average 19.2 percent over the past four quarters up to March, according to Thomson Reuters calculations, helped by approvals to treat more indications and expansion into newer markets. The drug accounted for 55 percent of the company’s revenue in the latest quarter.     AbbVie blamed a change in shipment timing and a strong dollar for a 14.3 percent drop in international sales in the three months to June.  Analysts, however, flagged concerns over the impact of rival Remicade’s copycat version on Humira.  “We have seen no impact of Remicade’s biosimilar on Humira sales,” AbbVie Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez said on a post-earnings call. He said he expected Humira sales to grow in the mid-teens for the year. Korean drugmaker Celltrion sells a biosimilar of Remicade in a few countries outside the United States. Citigroup analyst Andrew Baum said investors were “underestimating the impact of likely Humira revenue erosion.”  Sales of Viekira Pak, seen as AbbVie’s next blockbuster, also came in below analysts’ expectations. The company reported sales of $277 million for the hepatitis C treatment in the United States. Deutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas said the consensus expectation was $278 million. Viekira Pak, approved in December, is facing competition from Gilead Sciences Inc’s (GILD.O) Sovaldi and Harvoni. AbbVie’s revenue rose 11 percent to $5.48 billion for the second quarter, but missed the average analyst estimate of $5.62 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Separately, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the company’s treatment that targets the rarest genotype, or genetic makeup, of hepatitis C virus. Excluding special items, AbbVie earned $1.08 per share, above analysts’ average estimate of $1.06 per share. Up to Thursday’s close of $70.52, the company’s shares had gained about 8 percent this year.

281,ABBV,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-AbbVie reports first revenue miss in six quarters,"(Corrects to “AbbVie” from “Abbott” in paragraph 9) July 24 (Reuters) - AbbVie Inc on Friday reported quarterly revenue that missed analysts’ estimates for the first time in six quarters, sending its shares down 3 percent in premarket trading. Revenue rose 11 percent to $5.48 billion for the second quarter ended June 30, but missed the average analyst estimate of $5.62 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Deutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas attributed the revenue miss to smaller-than-expected sales of AbbVie’s hepatitis C treatment, Viekira Pak, in the United States.

Viekira Pak, approved in December, is seen as AbbVie’s next blockbuster, but the drug faces competition from Gilead Sciences Inc’s Sovaldi and Harvoni.

285,ABBV,AbbVie to seek approval for potential blockbuster leukemia drug,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc on Wednesday said its experimental treatment for a form of leukemia associated with a gene mutation met its primary goal in a mid-stage trial and that the company would seek U.S. approval of the medicine, which analysts have said has blockbuster sales potential. AbbVie, which is developing the drug venetoclax with Switzerland’s Roche Holding AG, said it would unveil data from the Phase II trial at an upcoming medical meeting and will seek U.S. marketing approval for the product before the end of 2015. The drug was tested in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who had a so-called 17p gene deletion that has been associated with aggressive cancer and survival of less than 2 to 3 years after diagnosis. The trial included patients with relapsed or advanced CLL, or those who had previously been untreated.   Venetoclax achieved its target overall response rate in the study, meaning it reduced the number of cancer cells by at least a predefined margin, the drugmakers said.   Safety of the drug was similar to that seen in earlier trials, with no unexpected new issues, AbbVie said  Brokerage Cowen and Co has predicted the medicine, if approved, could capture annual sales of $2 billion by 2020. It works by blocking BCL-2, a protein that prevents self-destruction of defective or cancerous cells in the body.  “Venetoclax may help restore the natural process that allows these leukemic cells to self-destruct,” Sandra Horning, Roche’s chief medical officer, said in a release. The FDA earlier this year granted “breakthrough therapy” status to the drug for previously treated CLL patients with the gene deletion, a designation that can help speed regulatory review. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a slow-progressing blood cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. AbbVie said about 14,620 new cases of CLL are diagnosed each year in the United States and that it is the most common leukemia seen in adults in western countries. About 3 to 10 percent of CLL patients have the 17p deletion when diagnosed, but it is found in 30 to 50 percent of patients who have relapsed or advanced disease, AbbVie said. Abbvie shares were down about 0.6 percent in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, amid a 1-percent decline for the broad stock market. Roche shares fell 2 percent.

292,ABBV,UPDATE 3-Perrigo recommends shareholders reject Mylan's tender offer,"(Adds Perrigo lawsuit against Mylan, closing stock prices) By Caroline Humer Sept 17 (Reuters) - Generic and over-the-counter drugmaker Perrigo Co on Thursday urged its shareholders to reject Mylan NV’s unsolicited $27 billion tender offer, saying it substantially undervalued the company. Mylan first proposed to buy Perrigo in April and, after being repeatedly rebuffed, launched a tender offer on Monday. It has said it would take control if more than 50 percent of Perrigo shares are tendered in the offer. That strategy is possible under takeover law in Ireland, where Perrigo has been incorporated since buying Irish drugmaker Elan in 2013. Perrigo also filed a lawsuit against Mylan in Manhattan federal court, seeking an injunction to block the closing of any tender offer unless Mylan corrects its alleged misleading statements to Perrigo shareholders about a potential merger. The lawsuit said Mylan overstated potential synergies, and falsely claimed power to delist Perrigo shares in an effort to strong-arm Perrigo shareholders into accepting the tender offer. Mylan, in a statement, said the lawsuit had no merit and was “an attempt by Perrigo to further frustrate the tender process and to prevent their shareholders from tendering to Mylan in support of this compelling, value creating transaction.” Netherlands-based Mylan has offered $75 in cash and 2.3 of its shares for each Perrigo share, a combination now worth $188.55 based on Mylan’s Thursday closing price of $49.37. Perrigo shares closed down $1.31 at $181.08. Joseph Papa, Perrigo’s chief executive, said in an interview that he does not believe his company’s shareholders will agree to swap their shares for Mylan shares, and that the deal premium of 13 percent was lower than in other pharmaceutical takeovers. “I canceled vacations this summer and I plan to spend more times with shareholders over the next 60 or so days to make sure they understand this is a bad deal,” Papa said. Perrigo shareholders have until Nov. 13 to take part in the tender offer. Shareholders often wait until near the closing date before deciding to participate, so it is unclear if Mylan will succeed. Buying Perrigo would give Mylan over-the-counter consumer and nutritional products and a line of generic topical medicines. A takeover would be the latest in a string of recent multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical deals, including Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Ltd’s $11 billion acquisition of Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd and AbbVie Inc’s  $21 billion offer for Pharmacyclics Inc.

293,ABBV,UPDATE 1-Mylan countersues Perrigo over 'misstatements' about tender offer,"(Adds further details on lawsuit and deal) By Nate Raymond NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Mylan NV countersued Perrigo Co on Tuesday over “serious misstatements” it made as part of its defense against an unsolicited $27 billion tender offer by the generic and over-the-counter drugmaker. In a filing in Manhattan federal court, Mylan sought an order requiring Perrigo to correct “false and misleading statements” it made as part of an effort to prevent any merger. The counterclaims were filed after Perrigo last Thursday sought an injunction to block the closing of any tender offer unless Mylan corrected its own alleged misleading statements to Perrigo shareholders about a potential merger. Perrigo’s lawsuit said Mylan overstated potential synergies, and falsely claimed power to delist Perrigo shares in an effort to strong-arm acceptance of the tender offer. But in Tuesday’s filing, Mylan said Perrigo management including CEO Joseph Papa, sought to mislead its own shareholders into rejecting an offer “that is, in fact, in their best interest.” Mylan said Papa for six weeks made public statements against the proposed deal without disclosing that he had in March made a “conflicting purchase” of more than $220,000 in Mylan stock. He then “inundated” shareholders with false statements about the proposed deal through an investor presentation and in media interviews, Mylan said. Mylan filed its counterclaims after earlier in the day saying that at the request of the Irish Takeover Panel, it would qualify a Sept. 8 statement that could itself be misleading and violate Irish takeover rules. Mylan had in that statement said that Perrigo’s stock had been “protected from the recent sell-off in the markets, solely as a result of our offer.” A spokesman for Perrigo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for Mylan had no immediate comment. Netherlands-based Mylan has offered $75 in cash and 2.3 of its shares for each Perrigo share, a combination now worth $182.30 based on Mylan’s Tuesday closing price of $46.65. Perrigo shares closed down $2.86 at $171.97. Perrigo shareholders have until Nov. 13 to take part in the tender offer. Shareholders often wait until near the closing date before deciding to participate, so it is unclear if Mylan will succeed. Buying Perrigo would give Mylan over-the-counter consumer and nutritional products and a line of generic topical medicines.

294,ABBV,AbbVie scraps Galapagos deal to focus on own arthritis drug,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc said one of its experimental drugs improved symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis in mid-stage studies and scrapped plans to buy rights to a similar treatment from Belgium’s Galapagos NV. Galapagos shares fell as much as 39 percent to 33.42 euros in Amsterdam on Friday, and were down 18 percent on Nasdaq at mid-afternoon. AbbVie shares fell about 2 percent to $55.37. If AbbVie’s drug ABT-494 succeeds in late-stage studies and is approved, analysts said that would help spare the suburban Chicago company about $1 billion in royalties it would have had to pay Galapagos for its pill, called filgotinib.  Both are members of a new class of medicines that block an inflammation-causing enzyme known as JAK1. Galapagos said it had no advance clues of AbbVie’s decision. Even so, the tiny company said it was already in talks with more than a half dozen other potential partners and would advance filgotinib into late-stage studies. Tests showed filgotinib to be more effective than AbbVie’s drug in targeting enzymes that cause inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, Galapagos said. “Galapagos management can negotiate another deal with a key rheumatoid arthritis player and advance filgotinib quickly,” Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison said in a note. Galapagos said a separate 2-year-old research collaboration with AbbVie to develop treatments for cystic fibrosis is continuing. Results from the first early stage-study in the inherited lung disease are expected next year. During two mid-stage rheumatoid arthritis studies, patients taking ABT-494 responded to the treatment at week 12, across all dose levels except for the lowest dose in the second study, AbbVie said on Friday.  The trials tested the drug in patients who were not responding adequately to two commonly prescribed arthritis treatments, TNF inhibitors and methotrexate. “ABT-494 also offers a faster path to Phase 3 development with less uncertainty,” company Chief Scientific Officer Michael Severino said in a statement. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when the immune system attacks the body’s tissues, causing joint pain, swelling and stiffness. Galapagos, which is also testing filgotinib and another experimental drug for irritable bowel disorders, has been touted as a tempting takeover target for companies such as AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson. Earlier this year, Galapagos said it had terminated an alliance with J&J;, begun in 2007, to develop treatments for inflammatory diseases, including GLPG1690 for a dangerous lung-scarring condition called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). It is now preparing to test the drug on its own in mid-stage studies.

Even so, the tiny company said it was already in talks with more than a half dozen other potential partners and would advance filgotinib into late-stage studies.

298,ABBV,FDA warns of serious liver injury risk with AbbVie hep C drugs,"(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Thursday issued a warning of potential risk of serious liver injury for certain patients using AbbVie’s hepatitis C treatments, Viekira Pak and Technivie, sending the drugmaker’s shares down more than 10 percent. The Food and Drug Administration said AbbVie had identified cases of hepatic decompensation and liver failure in patients with liver cirrhosis who were taking the medicines. “Some of these events resulted in liver transplantation or death,” the agency said in a posting on its website. It did not say how many deaths were reported. Shares of Gilead Sciences, which makes the top-selling rival hepatitis C treatments Sovaldi and Harvoni, rose 5.7 percent to $107.60. Shares of much smaller Enanta Pharmaceuticals, which helped develop the AbbVie drugs, plunged 40.6 percent to close at $23.90. Len Yaffe, portfolio manager of the StockDoc Partners healthcare fund, called the liver toxicity warning a “huge positive for Gilead.” The FDA said it is requiring AbbVie to include warnings about the risk of serious liver injury in the labels of its combination hepatitis C treatments. Since the approvals of Viekira Pak in December 2014 and Technivie in July 2015, at least 26 worldwide cases submitted to FDA Adverse Event Reporting System were considered possibly or probably related to Viekira Pak or Technivie, the agency said. “Because post-marketing events are reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between treatment and these events has not been established,” AbbVie spokeswoman Jackie Finley said in an emailed statement. She said the Viekira Pak and Technivie package inserts have been changed to say they should not be used in patients with a type of cirrhosis, which is advanced liver damage that can be caused by hepatitis.  The new information also includes a recommendation for physicians to assess evidence of liver decompensation prior to treatment and during treatment in cirrhotic patients. In most of the cases, liver injury occurred within 1 to 4 weeks of starting treatment, the FDA said, adding that some  cases occurred in patients who should not have been using the medicines. “Patients taking these medicines should contact their health care professional immediately if they develop fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, yellow eyes or skin, or light-colored stools, as these may be signs of liver injury,” the FDA said. Gilead, which was first to market with the new treatments that virtually guarantee a cure for the serious liver disease without any of the side effects of older treatments, came under intense fire for the high price of its drugs, which were listed for about $90,000 for a course of treatment. With competition from Viekira Pak, pharmacy benefit managers were able to negotiate steep discounts by playing one drugmaker against the other. Express Scripts Holding, the largest U.S. PBM backed Viekira, while CVS Health chose to favor Gilead’s drugs. Express Scripts said it will evaluate the warning “to determine if any additional action is required, especially for those with late-stage cirrhosis requesting coverage of Viekira Pak.” The PBM said it closely reviews all new clinical evidence and is able to rapidly respond to changes in drug labeling to ensure patients are well cared for.

303,ABBV,AbbVie projects double-digit annual earnings growth through 2020,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) reported higher quarterly sales and net income on Friday and forecast double-digit growth of earnings per share through 2020, putting the drugmaker in line to beat Wall Street’s current expectations. AbbVie, which was spun out of Abbott Laboratories in 2013, expects revenue of $37 billion in 2020, which is $5 billion more than the current Wall Street consensus, according to Chief Executive Officer Richard Gonzalez. Speaking on a conference call with reporters, he said the company projects a 10 percent compound annual growth rate over the next five years - driven by sales of arthritis drug Humira, which are seen topping $18 billion by 2020. For the third quarter, AbbVie posted net income of $1.24 billion, or 74 cents per share, on sales of $5.94 billion, compared with 31 cents per share and $5.02 billion, respectively, a year earlier. Wall Street analysts, on average, expected sales of $5.89 billion in the latest quarter. Excluding one-time items, AbbVie said it earned $1.13 a share. Worldwide sales of Humira rose 12 percent to $3.65 billion, but sales outside of the United States fell 9 percent, due in part to foreign exchange rates. Sales of hepatitis C treatment Viekira Pak totaled $469 billion, which fell short of the average Wall Street estimate of $506 million, as compiled by Evercore ISI. U.S. health regulators last week issued a warning of potential risk of serious liver injury for certain patients using Viekira Pak, but Gonzalez said the warning applies to just 3 to 4 percent of patients and “we don’t believe it will have a material impact on overall performance.” The CEO said AbbVie also expects to continue to widen its profit margins. The drugmaker, which achieved an adjusted operating margin of 44.9 percent in the third quarter, forecast a 2020 operating margin of over 50 percent.

307,ABBV,UPDATE 4-Drugmaker Shire to buy Baxalta for $32 bln after 6-month pursuit,"* Enlarged group to be world leader in rare diseases * Deal offers $18 and 0.1482 Shire ADS per Baxalta share * Baxalta haemophilia business a potential product risk   (Adds closing share prices, termination fee) By Ben Hirschler and Paul Sandle LONDON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Drugmaker Shire Plc  clinched its six-month pursuit of Baxalta International Inc  on Monday with an agreed $32 billion cash and stock offer, catapulting it to a leading position in treating rare diseases. The London-listed group, which first approached the U.S. company with an all-stock offer in July, won over the maker of treatments for rare blood conditions, cancers and immune system disorders after adding a cash sweetener. Shire’s U.S.-traded shares fell 9 percent, however, as investors worry about a potential competitive threat from Roche to Baxalta’s critically important haemophilia franchise, and on nerves over the price offered and a cost savings forecast that Jefferies analysts called “somewhat disappointing.” The deal marks a strong start to mergers and acquisitions in healthcare in 2016 after the sector had its biggest deal-making streak in history last year, with global transactions totalling $673 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. It also highlights the appeal of medicines for rare diseases targeting small groups of patients for which drugmakers can charge hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. “Together we will have the number one platform in rare diseases with a strong foundation for future growth,” Shire Chief Executive Officer Flemming Ornskov told reporters, after unveiling his company’s most ambitious acquisition yet. Shareholders will receive $18 in cash and 0.1482 Shire American depositary share per Baxalta share, implying a total value of $45.57 per share based on Jan. 8 prices. That is 37.5 percent above Baxalta’s price on Aug. 3, before Shire went public with its interest. Illinois-based Baxalta, which was spun off last year from Baxter International Inc, rejected Shire’s previous $30 billion all-stock offer in August, arguing it significantly undervalued the company. But Ornskov relentlessly pursued Baxalta, seeking to pressure it into agreeing to a deal by meeting with Baxalta’s major shareholders over a period of months. That enabled it to sidestep a hostile deal in which it would have faced takeover defences including a “poison pill” that stopped unwanted suitors from buying more than 10 percent of the company and a hard-to-replace board. Shares of Baxalta closed down 2.3 percent at $39.10 on the New York Stock Exchange, giving back earlier gains. Shire had initially offered only stock due to concerns a cash element might jeopardise the tax-free status of Baxalta’s spin-off from Baxter. However, Ornskov said he was confident that adding $18 in cash would maintain this tax-free status. “We came out without any doubt that this was not jeopardising the tax-free nature of the spin,” Ornskov said. Together, the two companies said they expected to deliver double-digit sales growth with more than $20 billion in annual revenue by 2020. With annual operating cost synergies of more than $500     million, additional revenue synergies and tax benefits from Shire’s Irish domicile, Shire said it expected the transaction to boost non-GAAP diluted earnings from 2017. Baxalta brings Shire a strong position in haemophilia treatments, although that could face a serious challenge by late 2017 or 2018 from Roche’s experimental antibody ACE910 that received breakthrough designation - given to potentially important advances over current treatments - from U.S. health regulators. The Roche drug has a long half-life that could allow for less frequent dosing. “A lot of people don’t like the deal” largely due to its  dependence on Baxalta’s haemophilia franchise, said John Boris, analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. “They believe Shire is buying an asset that is going to be under pressure, so it may not reach the $20 billion revenue by 2020 target,” Boris said. UBS analysts cautioned that Baxalta could actually dilute Shire earnings from 2019 to 2023 before being accretive again from 2024. Thanks to its base in Dublin, the combined company is expected to have an effective tax rate of 16 to 17 percent by 2017, down from around 23 percent for Baxalta, making the deal the latest transaction to result in lower tax rates. Ornskov has stepped up his acquisition efforts in the rare diseases space after a planned takeover by U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc fell through last year. He bought NPS Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion in February and Dyax for $5.9 billion in November. Shire signed an $18 billion facility to help finance its latest purchase. Shire was advised by Evercore, Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Deutsche Bank. Baxalta was advised by Goldman Sachs and Citi. According to Freeman/Thomson Reuters estimates, Shire’s advisers could be in line for fees of $50 million-$60 million and Baxalta’s may earn $70 million-$80 million. Baxalta said the termination fee on the Shire merger was equal to $369 million.

309,ABBV,"Roche, AbbVie get U.S. priority review status for leukemia drug","ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche said on Tuesday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted ‘priority review’ status for its venetoclax drug for the treatment of a blood cancer, which it is developing with partner AbbVie. Analysts have said the drug has ‘blockbuster’ sales potential, meaning sales of more than $1 billion a year, and U.S. regulators had already fast-tracked it for approval last May by designating it a breakthrough therapy.  The companies have said the drug has met its primary treatment goal in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who had a so-called 17p gene deletion. The mutation has been associated with aggressive cancer and survival of less than two to three years after diagnosis. Roche expects to win FDA approval in the first half of 2016, a spokeswoman at its Basel headquarters said. Brokerage Cowen and Co. has predicted that venetoclax, if approved, could capture annual sales of $2 billion by 2020. It works by blocking BCL-2, a protein that is believed to prevent self-destruction of defective or cancerous cells in the body. “Venetoclax is a potential new way to treat this difficult type of chronic lymphocytic leukemia,” Sandra Horning, Roche’s chief medical officer and head of global product development, said in a statement. Roche will have marketing rights for venetoclax in the United States.  An AbbVie spokesman in Paris said his company will market the drug in Europe, where the European Medicines Agency has validated its marketing authorization application. CLL is a slow-growing cancer of the blood and bone marrow and is one of the most common adult leukemias worldwide. It is generally considered incurable. The most common serious adverse events were fever, a low red blood cell count as a result of immune response, pneumonia in 6 percent of the 107 study participants and a low white blood cell count with fever in another 5 percent.

311,ABBV,U.S. patent office rules against Amgen Humira challenge,"(Reuters) - U.S. patent officials on Thursday denied petitions by Amgen to review two formulation patents on AbbVie’s Humira, a potential setback in Amgen efforts to market a biosimilar version of the world’s top-selling prescription medicine. In June, Amgen, the world’s biggest biotechnology company, asked the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the review, arguing that the patents in question should not have been granted in the first place for Humira, an injected rheumatoid arthritis treatment with annual sales approaching $14 billion. In declining to review the patents, the agency said “we determine, based on the petition and the accompanying evidence, that Amgen has not shown a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on any of its challenges.” Amgen said it still plans to challenge the legality of the patents. “Although we are disappointed by the PTO’s decision, we continue to question the validity of the patents,” the company said in a statement. “We look forward to presenting our position in court.”  Amgen in November became the first company to file with U.S. health regulators seeking approval to sell a less expensive biosimilar version of the blockbuster medicine. Several companies are also developing biosimilar versions of Humira. Amgen has said it expects the first of its several biosimilars in development to reach the market between 2017 and 2019. AbbVie this week said it sees Humira sales reaching $18 billion by 2020. Based on its various patents, AbbVie said it does not expect competition from biosimilars until 2022.

316,ABBV,AbbVie shares fall on sales outlooks for Humira and Viekira Pak,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) on Friday predicted slower growth this year in overseas sales of its blockbuster Humira arthritis drug and cut sales estimate for its new Viekira Pak treatment for hepatitis C, sending shares 4 percent lower. AbbVie reported slightly better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, but revenue was shy of expectations for a second time in three quarters. Sales of Humira, the world’s biggest-selling drug, jumped 10.5 percent to $3.72 billion in the quarter, accounting for almost two thirds of total company revenue.      Viekira Pak posted sales of $554 million, up from $469 million in the prior quarter. Sales of AbbVie’s new Imbruvica leukemia treatment jumped to $343 million from $304 million in the third quarter. But sales of all three medicines came in slightly below Wall Street forecasts, renewing questions about the sustainability of AbbVie’s most important products, said Vamil Divan, an analyst with Credit Suisse. “Because this company is so leveraged to Humira, people worry that if something were to happen, the company’s sales growth, earnings and cash flow could become challenged,” Divan said. He added that new competitive threats to Viekira Pak and Imbruvica could also arise, and hurt company earnings.  In a conference call with analysts, AbbVie officials said sales growth of Humira outside the United States will likely slow to the mid-single-digit range this year. They cited competition from a cheaper biosimilar form of rival arthritis drug Enbrel, which was approved late last year in Europe.  AbbVie previously said Viekira Pak had potential to soon generate annual sales of $3 billion, but on Friday it forecast sales of $2 billion this year. It cited competition from Merck & Co’s (MRK.N) Zepatier hepatitis C drug, approved on Thursday, and recent warnings of  liver risk from Viekira Pak that now appear on the drug’s label.

321,ABBV,FDA approves Merck's new hepatitis C pill,"(Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Thursday approved a new once-daily pill for the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus made by Merck & Co Inc, which said it will sell the drug at a lower list price than its competitors. The list price for Zepatier will be $54,600 for a 12-week regimen, which Merck said it expects “to be in the range of net prices” for comparable treatments. Gilead Sciences Inc, which secured an early lead in the lucrative market for oral hepatitis C drugs with the $1,000-per-pill Sovaldi, currently sells an enhanced version of that drug as a single-tablet regimen called Harvoni at a list price of $94,500. AbbVie Inc followed in late 2014 with a multi-pill regimen. Nevertheless, AbbVie secured exclusive contracts with payers such as pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co, forcing Gilead to discount its own contract prices. Gilead has continued to dominate the market with hepatitis C drug sales of more than $14 billion in the first nine months of 2015. The Food and Drug Administration approved Zepatier, with or without the older antiviral drug ribavirin, for patients infected with the most common form of hepatitis C, genotype 1, as well as the less common genotype 4. The new drug’s FDA label says liver-related blood tests should be performed prior to starting therapy and at certain times during treatment. Clinical trials found that 12 or 16 weeks of treatment with Merck’s Zepatier reduced the virus to undetectable levels, which is considered a cure, in more than 94 percent of patients, the FDA said in a statement.

323,ABBV,CORRECTED-UPDATE 4-FDA staff backs biosimilar to Remicade; J&J; and AbbVie fall," (This version of the story corrects that Zarzio is a version of Amgen’s Neupogen, not Neulasta, and that Zarzio was priced at a discount to Neupogen, not Neulasta, in final two paragraphs) By Ransdell Pierson (Reuters) - U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff members on Friday said  Celltrion Inc’s biosimilar form of Johnson & Johnson’s Remicade arthritis drug appeared “highly similar” to the widely used branded product. The news sent shares of J&J;, whose annual Remicade sales of $6.5 billion are mostly in the United States, down almost 4 percent. It also hit AbbVie Inc and Amgen Inc, whose arthritis treatments work the same way. AbbVie, whose Humira is the world’s top-selling drug, fell nearly 6 percent, and Amgen, maker of Enbrel, was down 3 percent. Pfizer Inc, which has teamed up with South Korea’s Celltrion in marketing the biosimilar, rose nearly 1 percent. FDA scientists released their favorable report ahead of a  meeting Tuesday of an independent medical advisory panel to the agency. The panel will decide whether to recommend approval of Remsima to treat rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel conditions like Crohn’s disease.  Celltrion and Pfizer want to sell Remsima in the United States as a cut-price copy of Remicade, or infliximab. Some analysts expect it to sell for a 25 percent discount.      “The data submitted by Celltrion show that (Remsima) is highly similar to U.S.-licensed Remicade” in treating rheumatoid arthritis and a related condition called ankylosing spondylitis, the FDA briefing paper said. It cited only “minor differences in clinically inactive components.” Celltrion presented the FDA with clinical data on the use of Remsima against rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, but the FDA’s staff said it is likely also safe and effective for other conditions Remicade treats, including Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis. Raymond James analyst Chris Raymond said that broad interpretation of Remsima’s likely effectiveness could signal its approval as a treatment for all diseases for which Remicade can now be marketed. “As such, we remain cautious on Amgen shares,” Raymond said. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said Remsima and one other Remicade biosimilar may be introduced in the United States in 2018. The branded J&J; drug could lose half its sales by 2020, he added.     “The biggest potential damage could be to J&J;, which has U.S. rights to Remicade,” said Conover. He predicted Pfizer would capture about $500 million in annual Remsima sales.  The FDA report did not hurt shares of Merck & Co, which sells Remicade overseas. But the stock slumped Wednesday after the company said biosimilar competition in Europe helped drive its fourth-quarter sales of Remicade down almost 30 percent to $396 million.  Celltrion already sells Remsima in dozens of other countries.    Remicade, Humira and Enbrel work by blocking an inflammation-causing protein called Tumor Necrosis factor (TNF). Raymond said more than 60 other anti-TNF biosimilars are in development and could commoditize the drug class much sooner than thought.    Remsima would become the second approved biosimilar in the United States, following Novartis AG’s September introduction of Zarzio. That drug is a version of Amgen’s Neupogen, which boosts infection-fighting white blood cells in patients who have undergone chemotherapy. Novartis priced Zarzio at a 15 percent discount to Neupogen.

326,ABBV,AbbVie buys rights to Boehringer psoriasis drug for $595 mln,"March 7 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker AbbVie has acquired marketing rights to a promising experimental psoriasis treatment from Germany’s Boehringer Ingelheim for an initial upfront payment of $595 million. The deal covers the compound BI655066, which is being tested on humans in the third and last phase required for regulatory approval. AbbVie will be solely responsible for selling the drug but unlisted Boehringer will retain an option to co-promote it in asthma, the companies said in a statement on Monday. In addition to the $595 million, Boehringer will also get milestone payments and royalties on net sales, depending on the drug’s successful development. The terms of these further payments were not disclosed. However, AbbVie said it expected the transaction to be approximately $0.08 dilutive to earnings per share in 2016. The drug is also being tested to treat Crohn’s disease, a chronic bowel inflammation. Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease in which the growth cycle of skin cells is accelerated, affecting about 125 million patients across the word. There are currently a range of treatments to improve symptoms but no cure. BI655066 in October was shown to help more patients and work faster than Johnson & Johnson’s Stelara in a Phase II study with 166 participants. Boehringer said at the time it was preparing several Phase III trials. AbbVie’s drug Humira against rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, the world’s biggest-selling prescription drug, is facing potential competition from cheaper copycat versions known as biosimilars. Amgen in November sought U.S. approval to sell its less expensive alternative to Humira. Psoriasis has been targeted as a promising treatment area by a number of drugmakers, including Novartis, which recently launched a product called Cosentyx for the condition.

327,ABBV,J&J; psoriasis drug Stelara eases Crohn's disease in second trial,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson’s Stelara psoriasis drug has shown effectiveness against Crohn’s disease in a second late-stage trial, the company said on Friday, bolstering prospects of its approval for the additional use.  The Phase 3 study showed Stelara induced remissions in moderate to severe Crohn’s disease patients who had previously failed to benefit from TNF inhibitors, a leading class of medicines for the inflammatory bowel disease. Those treatments include J&J;’s own Remicade and AbbVie Inc’s Humira. J&J; presented the favorable data on Friday at the 11th Congress of the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organization in Amsterdam. In October, the company said Stelara was significantly more effective than placebo in another study of patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s symptoms.  Stelara is now awaiting U.S. approval as a treatment for the condition, based on results of that earlier trial.  The drug, which works by blocking two inflammation-causing proteins called IL-12 and IL-23, is one of J&J;’s biggest, with sales last year of almost $2.5 billion. It is approved in the United States for adults with moderate to severe psoriasis, an inflammatory skin condition caused by an overactive immune system. Crohn’s is a chronic inflammatory condition in the gastrointestinal tract, causing abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss and fever. It affects about 700,000 Americans and nearly 250,000 Europeans, J&J; said. Patients in the 741-patient study received either of two intravenous doses of Stelara, or of a placebo. After six weeks, 34 percent of patients receiving either Stelara dose achieved a target reduction in Crohn’s symptoms, compared with 22 percent of those taking a placebo. Similar incidence of side effects and infections were seen in the Stelara and placebo patient groups, J&J; said. Researchers at the meeting said other studies were under way to show whether Stelara can maintain control of Crohn’s symptoms over extended periods. Shares of J&J; were up 0.2 percent at $106.92 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Those treatments include J&J;’s own Remicade and AbbVie Inc’s Humira. J&J; presented the favorable data on Friday at the 11th Congress of the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organization in Amsterdam. In October, the company said Stelara was significantly more effective than placebo in another study of patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s symptoms. Stelara is now awaiting U.S. approval as a treatment for the condition, based on results of that earlier trial. The drug, which works by blocking two inflammation-causing proteins called IL-12 and IL-23, is one of J&J;’s biggest, with sales last year of almost $2.5 billion. It is approved in the United States for adults with moderate to severe psoriasis, an inflammatory skin condition caused by an overactive immune system. Crohn’s is a chronic inflammatory condition in the gastrointestinal tract, causing abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss and fever. It affects about 700,000 Americans and nearly 250,000 Europeans, J&J; said.

332,ABBV,"UPDATE 3-Pfizer, Allergan scrap $160 bln deal after U.S. tax rule change","(Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Ireland-based Allergan Plc (AGN.N) walked away from their $160 billion merger on Wednesday, a major win for President Barack Obama, who has been pushing to curb deals in which companies move overseas to cut taxes. Pfizer said the decision was driven by new U.S. Treasury rules aimed at such deals, called inversions. The merger would have allowed New York-based Pfizer to cut its tax bill by an estimated $1 billion annually by domiciling in Ireland, where tax rates are lower. While the new Treasury rules did not name Pfizer and Allergan, one of the provisions targeted a specific feature of their merger - Allergan’s history as a major acquirer of other companies. Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders said on CNBC television that the new Treasury rule would not stop the company from doing other stock-based acquisitions as soon as this fall. The new Treasury rule takes into account the past three years of a company’s deals. “It really looked like they did a very fine job at constructing a temporary rule to stop this deal and obviously it was successful,” Saunders said. Saunders said that he would stay to run the standalone company with a focus on both deals and research and development. Allergan will also move ahead with plans for its $40.5 billion sale of its generic drug business to Israel’s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA). It expects the transaction to close by June. With the deal behind it, Pfizer said it would decide this year about whether to split off its hundreds of generic medicines into a separate business. It had put off making that decision until 2019 after announcing its deal with Allergan last November. Pfizer will pay Allergan $150 million to reimburse expenses from its deal. Shares of Allergan, which fell 15 percent on Tuesday, were up 3.3 percent at $244.38 at mid-afternoon. Pfizer rose 4.7 percent to $32.84.  Pfizer has new products coming and plenty of money that it could put to work with acquisitions, though not on the scale of Allergan, said Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Asset Management in New York, which holds Pfizer shares. It is not clear that Pfizer should definitely split into two, he said. “It is true that these larger companies are a little unwieldy to manage,” Funtleyder said, “but there are plenty of strategies to keep them together and increase shareholder value.”     The decision to call off the deal came in part because Pfizer was concerned that any tweaks to salvage its deal with Allergan might have provoked new rules by the Treasury, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Tuesday. Obama on Tuesday called global tax avoidance a “huge problem” and urged Congress to take action to stop U.S. companies from deals that allow it. U.S. inversion rules have unraveled other mergers. U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) abandoned its $55 billion takeover of Ireland-domiciled peer Shire Plc (SHP.L) in 2014 after the Obama administration cracked down on inversions. AbbVie had to pay Shire a $1.6 billion break-up fee. ",4062016,http://www.reuters.com/article/allergan-ma-pfizer/update-3-pfizer-allergan-scrap-160-bln-deal-after-u-s-tax-rule-change-idUSL3N17936X

335,ABBV,AbbVie/Roche drug gets U.S. approval for a rare type of leukemia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AbbVie Inc won U.S. regulatory approval on Monday for a new drug to treat patients with a rare type of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a blood cancer. The drug, venetoclax, was approved for patients with a genetic mutation known as 17p gene deletion, which is a marker for a particularly aggressive form of CLL. Patients with the disease survive an average of less than three years following diagnosis. AbbVie developed the drug with Roche Holding AG. It will be marketed by both companies in the United States under the brand name Venclexta, and by AbbVie elsewhere. “Venclexta is the first approved medicine designed to trigger a natural process that helps cells self-destruct,” Roche Chief Medical Officer Dr. Sandra Horning said in a statement. The approval came well ahead of the FDA’s late June action date for a decision. The FDA granted “breakthrough” designation to the drug last year, allowing it to be reviewed on a speedier schedule than normal. AbbVie said it was also studying the drug in a wider population of patients with CLL, including those without a genetic mutation who have failed previous therapies, and in other blood cancers, including multiple myeloma. Analysts on average estimate the drug could generate peak annual sales of $1.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. CLL is one of the most common types of leukemia in adults, with about 15,000 new cases diagnosed each year, according to the National Cancer Institute. Patients with a 17p deletion account for about 10 percent of those with untreated CLL and about 20 percent of those with relapsed CLL. “These patients now have a new, targeted therapy that inhibits a protein involved in keeping tumor cells alive,” Dr. Richard Pazdur, director of the FDA’s oncology division, said in a statement. In a trial of 106 patients with CLL patients with a 17p deletion who had received at least one previous therapy, 80 percent experienced complete or partial remission of their disease. The drug is a pill given once a day. The approval “marks a major milestone for our company,” said AbbVie Chief Executive Officer Richard Gonzalez. Venclexta is the first cancer drug that AbbVie developed in-house. Last year the company acquired Pharmacyclics for $21 billion, giving it control over the blood cancer drug Imbruvica. Imbruvica is already approved to treat patients with CLL and those who have a 17p deletion.

337,ABBV,New AbbVie hepatitis C regimen shows high cure rates: studies,"(Reuters) - An experimental once-daily combination hepatitis C treatment being developed by AbbVie Inc demonstrated very high cure rates across a wide range of disease genotypes, according to data presented on Saturday, likely giving the company a more competitive product if approved.  Cure rates of 97 percent to 100 percent over either eight or 12 weeks of treatment were achieved in the clinical trials with the one pill, once-a-day combination of ABT-493 and ABT-530, which use different methods to block virus replication. The combination would provide greater convenience for a wider variety of patients than AbbVie’s Viekira Pak, improving  chances of making inroads into the market domination currently enjoyed by Gilead Sciences Inc. Viekira Pak, which is approved for genotype 1, the most common form of the serious liver disease in the United States, consists of four drugs and involves taking three pills in the morning and one in the evening. It currently has only about 5 percent of the market, with Gilead owning about 90 percent. Another AbbVie product treats genotype 4, which is most common in Egypt and other parts of Africa. The new one pill combination proved effective across the spectrum of genotypes 1-6 in the midstage studies presented at a European liver disease meeting in Barcelona. In patients without cirrhosis who were not helped by an older regimen, 97 percent of those with genotype 1 and 98 percent of those with genotype 2 had no detectable hepatitis C virus in the blood 12 weeks after completing eight weeks of therapy, which is considered cured. Patients with genotype 3 and no cirrhosis receiving treatment for the first time had a 97 percent cure rate with eight weeks of therapy. Cure rates of 100 percent were achieved with 12 weeks of treatment in genotype 3 patients with cirrhosis, and in non-cirrhotic patients with genotypes 4, 5 and 6. “These new data show us the potential of ABT-493 and ABT-530 in genotype 3 patients new to therapy even with the added complication of compensated cirrhosis,” Dr. Paul Kwo, one of the lead investigators and professor of medicine at the Indiana University School of Medicine, said in a statement.  Cirrhosis, a form or severe scarring, is an indication of advanced disease that can lead to diminished liver function or liver failure. The most common side effects were fatigue, headache, nausea and diarrhea, the company reported.

343,ABBV,"AbbVie forges deeper into cancer, as clock ticks for Humira","(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc placed another big bet on new cancer drugs on Thursday with a $5.8 billion acquisition that could lessen its dependence on arthritis treatment Humira, the world’s top selling drug. Shares of AbbVie rose 1.3 percent in afternoon trading.  The suburban Chicago drugmaker said it would buy privately held Stemcentrx and its experimental treatment for small cell lung cancer, which accounts for about 10 percent to 15 percent of all lung cancers and is notoriously difficult to treat.  It brings AbbVie into the broad and lucrative arena of solid tumors, such as lung cancer, breast cancer and colon cancer. AbbVie’s current drugs, including leukemia treatment Imbruvica, focus on blood cancers, a smaller group of patients. Companies with innovative cancer drugs, especially ones that spur the immune system to attack tumors, are attractive takeover targets. These life-extending new treatments can command extremely high prices that health insurers seem willing to pay for, unlike some other therapeutic categories where they are putting pressure on price. “The mantra to reimbursement is innovation, and AbbVie is heading down the right path” by its widening focus on oncology, said John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. AbbVie last year bought Pharmacyclics Inc and its half-ownership of Imbruvica for $21 billion. It sells the drug with Johnson & Johnson.  U.S. rival Bristol-Myers Squibb has been particularly successful with its oncology focus. It predicted on Thursday its earnings will jump as much as 29 percent this year, fueled by its new Opdivo treatment for melanoma and lung cancer. A similar new drug from Merck & Co also has a list price of $150,000. Also on Thursday, French drugmaker Sanofi announced its $9.3 billion offer to buy Medivation, which makes prostate cancer treatment Xtandi. Stemcentrx’s drug, called Rova-T, is a toxic chemical that has been loaded onto an antibody. It targets a protein called DLL3 found in more than 80 percent of patients with the cancer. A biomarker is used to help select patients whose cancers express the protein.    Late-stage trials involving patients who have already failed to benefit from chemotherapy and radiation are under way and AbbVie expects the drug to be approved by 2018. “Oncology is an important growth driver and an area we plan to build a leading portfolio,” Michael Severino, AbbVie’s chief scientific officer, said in an interview. But he said AbbVie will remain heavily involved in arthritis, psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases that are treated by Humira, which generates $14 billion in annual sales. AbbVie’s quarterly earnings results on Thursday demonstrated its reliance on Humira, for which sales jumped 15 percent to $3.58 billion, accounting for 60 percent of company revenue.    As sales of Humira rise by double-digit percentages each year, investors are growing ever more fretful because its main U.S. patent lapses in December. AbbVie says other patents will stave off introduction of cheaper biosimilar forms of Humira until at least 2022.     AbbVie said it would pay about $2 billion in cash for Stemcentrx and fund the remainder with stock. Stemcentrx shareholders may also receive up to $4 billion in cash if certain performance milestones are achieved. AbbVie, which expects the deal to close in the second quarter, lowered its full-year adjusted profit forecast to $4.62-$4.82 per share, from its earlier view of $4.90-$5.10. It said the deal would be dilutive this year and for several years to come.

Shares of Coherus, which specializes in developing biosimilars, or copies of biotech drugs, rose 16 percent to $18.91. AbbVie’s shares were down 4 percent at $59.90. Such reviews, known as Inter Partes Reviews (IPRs), allow anyone to challenge the validity of a patent far more cheaply and quickly than going through the U.S. federal court system. The standard for institution of IPR is a “reasonable likelihood of success,” J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott wrote in a client note.

Companies have taken advantage of the procedure in unexpectedly high numbers since it was put in place in 2012. “We are confident in the validity of our patents and will vigorously defend them,” AbbVie said in an emailed statement. Sales of Humira, the world’s top-selling drug, have expanded by double-digit percentages each year, but investors are getting increasingly anxious with the drug’s main U.S. patent set to expire in December. In response, AbbVie has been beefing up its pipeline by buying newer drugs.

363,ABBV,Blockbuster hopes grow for Ablynx drug backed by AbbVie,"(Reuters) - Ablynx’s hopes for a potential multibillion-dollar drug were boosted on Thursday by strong clinical trial results in rheumatoid arthritis, vindicating a $175 million bet placed on the product by U.S. pharma group AbbVie in 2013. Belgian drugmaker Ablynx, which produces so-called nanobody medicines derived from camel and llama antibodies, said that a 12-week Phase IIb trial showed that its experimental drug vobarilizumab produced clinical remission from disease in up to 41 percent of patients. Those results compared well with Roche’s established product Actemra, which has to be given more frequently and has more side-effects.  Shares in Ablynx jumped 15.1 percent to 13.27 euros by 0448 ET. “We’re getting really stand-out data, which is great, and it is the first step for us in providing a data package to AbbVie, who will decide later in the year whether to take up their option and license the product,” Ablynx CEO Edwin Moses told Reuters. Both the Roche and Ablynx drugs target a protein called interleukin 6, which is involved in the inflammation underlying rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Actemra had sales last year of $1.5 billion and Moses said that vobarilizumab also has blockbuster potential, assuming other clinical trials are positive. “If you look at the size of the opportunity, not just in RA but also in lupus and other possible inflammatory indications, you have to begin to think in the billions (of dollars) in terms of the sales opportunity,” Moses said. AbbVie currently sells the RA treatment Humira, which is the world’s top-selling prescription drug, but it is looking for new medicines to expand its portfolio to counter the impact of cut-price competition from biosimilar copies of Humira in the coming years. Ablynx’s product could help to underpin the U.S. company’s market-leading position in RA, though analysts at Jefferies said it is not yet clear if AbbVie viewed vobarilizumab as a must-have product. AbbVie signed a partnership deal worth up to $840 million for the Ablynx medicine three years ago, including a $175 million upfront payment. The remaining $665 million is payable in future milestones if AbbVie opts to license the drug and it proves successful. Ablynx will also be eligible to receive royalties on sales, assuming the drug makes it to market. Moses said that he expects AbbVie to decide whether to license vobarilizumab — triggering a $75 million payment — after it sees results from a second RA trial slated for August.

368,ABBV,Drugmaker AbbVie bumps up profit forecast on strong Humira sales,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) posted higher-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue, driven by demand for its flagship drug Humira, and raised its earnings forecast for the year. Humira - the world’s biggest-selling drug - generated about $14 billion in sales last year and accounted for about 64 percent of AbbVie’s net revenue in the quarter. The drug, used to treat forms of arthritis and Crohn’s disease among other conditions, generated sales of $4.15 billion in the quarter, topping the consensus estimate of $3.93 billion, compiled by Evercore ISI. Humira’s main patent lapses in December, opening the drug up to potential competition from cheaper biosimilars being developed by companies including Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), Coherus Biosciences Inc (CHRS.O) and Germany’s Boehringer Ingelheim. Amgen, as the first to seek U.S. approval, could end up first to market, after an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration backed its copycat version earlier this month. AbbVie, however, has said numerous other patents will stave off the introduction of biosimilar forms of Humira until at least 2022. “Much of the debate around AbbVie is on the longer-term durability of Humira and on that point we expect nothing to really change despite the strong quarter,” Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a note. To be sure, AbbVie has been diversifying its portfolio to reduce its overwhelming dependence on Humira. The company said in April it would buy cancer drug developer Stemcentrx for $5.8 billion. Last year, the suburban Chicago drugmaker bought Pharmacyclics Inc and its half-ownership of cancer drug Imbruvica for $21 billion. AbbVie sells the drug with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and said it brought in quarterly sales of $439 million, exceeding the consensus estimate by $9 million. AbbVie’s hepatitis C treatment Viekira Pak, which competes with drugs from Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) and Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N), brought in sales of $419 million, versus the consensus estimate of $411 million.

AbbVie’s proposal to buy Shire in a $55 billion so-called tax inversion deal was called off in November 2014. Inversion deals are transactions in which the acquiring company moves its headquarters to its target’s home base to take advantage of lower tax rates. Elliott Associates, a hedge fund founded by billionaire Paul Singer, had said in 2014 that it made money on its Shire position in the third quarter, but suffered a loss in the fourth quarter when the share price tumbled on news the deal would collapse. The case has been filed in the Cook County, Illinois Circuit Court, AbbVie said in a regulatory filing on Friday.

372,ABBV,UPDATE 5-Pfizer boosts cancer drug roster with $14 bln Medivation deal,"(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), beating out numerous other bidders, said it agreed to buy U.S. cancer drug company Medivation Inc MDVN.O for $14 billion in cash, adding its blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi to the company’s growing oncology roster. Medivation shares jumped nearly 20 percent to close at $80.42, just shy of the offer price of $81.50 per share. Shares of Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker, were down 0.4 percent at $34.84.  The offer is a 55-percent premium to Sanofi SA’s (SASY.PA) initial bid to buy Medivation for $52.50 per share in April, which pushed the San Francisco-based company to put itself up for sale. It represents a 118-percent increase since Reuters reported on March 30 that Medivation had hired JP Morgan to handle interest from companies in a potential acquisition.    The planned purchase of Medivation, with its $2.2 billion-a-year Xtandi, is the latest in a number of deals by large drugmakers willing to pay top dollar for cancer drugs that are more effective than standard, older treatments. Perhaps the most notable example is AbbVie Inc’s (ABBV.N) $21 billion purchase last year of Pharmacyclics. The deal gave AbbVie shared ownership with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) in the blockbuster leukemia drug Imbruvica. Analysts predicted the deal would not raise antitrust concerns because Pfizer does not currently sell a prostate cancer drug aside from generics.   Pfizer said its earnings would increase immediately after buying Medivation. The deal comes four months after Pfizer and Ireland-based Allergan Plc (AGN.N) scrapped their $160 billion merger. Pfizer has since bought Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc in a $5.2 billion deal to add an eczema gel to its portfolio. The Medivation deal illustrates a shift in Pfizer’s M&A; strategy from lowering taxes - the rationale behind the failed Allergan tax inversion deal - to strengthening its lineup of branded drugs, especially lucrative cancer treatments. Pfizer, in a conference call with analysts, said it still plans to decide by year-end whether to split into separate companies selling either low-growth generics or patent-protected brand medicines.  “The Medivation deal increases the likelihood of a split,” said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris. But, he said, Pfizer would likely first try to buy other drugmakers or their best assets in order to further strengthen its branded-drug portfolio. A year ago, Pfizer paid $15 billion for Hospira, which sells generic hospital products and is developing biosimilars meant to compete with big-selling injectable biotech drugs. That deal was seen by Wall Street as a way of bolstering its generic drugs ahead of potentially divesting the business.  Pfizer’s biggest growth driver is a new breast cancer drug called Ibrance. The company is also trying to catch up with Merck & Co (MRK.N) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) in developing immuno-oncology drugs that work by taking the brakes off the immune system to fight cancers. Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read told analysts the Medivation deal was mainly driven by the desire to obtain Xtandi, although he expressed high hopes for talazoparib and pidilizumab, experimental Medivation drugs for breast cancer and lymphoma, respectively. Xtandi generated U.S. net sales of $330.3 million in the second quarter. Japanese drugmaker Astellas Pharma Inc (4503.T) owns the rights to sell Xtandi outside the United States, where it generated sales of $240 million in the period. Read said Xtandi, which was approved four years ago to treat men who had failed to benefit from prostate cancer treatments, could capture far greater sales if it is eventually approved for earlier use and is prescribed by urologists. “The product is just at the beginning of its growth cycle,” Read predicted.  Some analysts, including BMO’s Alex Arfaei, said Pfizer appeared to be overpaying for Medivation. But Piper Jaffray analyst Richard Purkiss said the price is not excessive given Xtandi’s potential for earlier treatment in coming years. Reuters had reported that Pfizer, Merck, Celgene Corp (CELG.O) and Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) had submitted expressions of interest to buy Medivation.   “Given the already very high price being discussed, the difficult public relationship between Medivation and Sanofi ...  we see a higher bid as very unlikely, but not impossible,” RBC Capital Partners wrote in a client note ahead of the announcement.      Sanofi said while it recognized the potential strategic benefits of a combination with Medivation, it was a “disciplined acquirer and remained committed to acting in the best interests of Sanofi shareholders.”  Pfizer said the deal was approved by boards of both companies and should be completed in the third or fourth quarter. Shares of other cancer drug companies, including Incyte Corp (INCY.O) and Seattle Genetics (SGEN.O), also rose on Monday, as investors speculated about  more dealmaking in the sector.  Pfizer’s financial advisers were Guggenheim Securities and Centerview Partners, with Ropes & Gray LLP providing legal counsel.  J.P. Morgan Securities and Evercore were Medivation’s financial advisers, while Cooley LLP and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz served as its legal advisers.

380,ABBV,EMA committee conditionally approves AbbVie leukaemia drug,"Oct 14 (Reuters) - AbbVie Inc won the conditional backing of an advisory committee of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Friday for a drug to treat a form of blood cancer. The drug, venclyxto, or venetoclax, is aimed at chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) patients with a genetic mutation known as 17p gene deletion, a marker for a particularly aggressive form of the disease. (bit.ly/2dYKT7R) The EMA grants conditional approval for drugs that fill an unmet medical need for serious conditions and show early evidence of clinical benefits outweighing the risks. Venclyxto, developed by AbbVie and Roche Holding AG, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April to treat the disease. AbbVie will market the drug outside the United States, while both companies will sell it in the country under the brand name Venclexta.

383,ABBV,"AbbVie's Humira loses momentum, shares plunge","(Reuters) - A slowdown in sales of AbbVie Inc’s (ABBV.N) Humira arthritis treatment sent the drugmaker’s shares 6 percent lower on Friday, highlighting the company’s heavy reliance on the $15 billion-a-year medicine. Humira sales increased 11.3 percent in the third quarter,  compared with growth of 14.9 percent and 17.4 percent, respectively, in the first and second quarters of 2016.   The drug, also used to treat Crohn’s disease and psoriasis,  generated sales of $4.06 billion, about $130 million shy of Wall Street’s expectations. Humira, the world’s biggest-selling drug, accounted for about 63 percent of AbbVie’s net revenue. “Humira looks more vulnerable, so there’s a healthy skepticism in the stock market today,” Guggenheim Securities analyst Tony Butler said. “Anything affecting Humira price-wise or demand-wise has a massive impact” on investors.  Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) on Thursday reported flat quarterly sales for its similar Enbrel arthritis drug and cautioned that discounts and rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and health insurers next year would likely negate wholesale price increases for the drug. AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez, in contrast, said on a conference call on Friday that the company has concluded negotiations with insurers for coverage in 2017 and 2018 and encountered no significantly higher hurdles to net prices. Sales of medicines are affected by many factors, including changes in prices and the volume of prescriptions. AbbVie hiked its U.S. list price for Humira twice this year, by 9.9 percent on Jan. 21 and 7.9 percent on June 23, although rebates and discounts moderated the net price. Gonzales said Humira prescriptions grew over 13 percent in the quarter, accounting for much of its sales growth. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said Humira’s disappointing quarterly performance questions how long it can grow amid competition from other drugs, including looming cheaper biosimilar forms of Humira.

Humira, considered the world’s biggest-selling medicine, generates $15 billion in annual sales and treats rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease and psoriasis, among other conditions. Biologics including Humira are manufactured in living cells, then extracted and purified. As they are more complex than traditional medicines and cannot be copied with precision, their knock-off versions are called biosimilars, rather than generics. Several companies are developing biosimilar versions of top-selling biotech medicines for rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. In September, Amgen Inc’s Humira biosimilar was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration - the first one to win U.S. regulatory nod for the drug. But AbbVie is trying to block its launch, contending that Humira’s patents should protect it until at least 2022. In Momenta’s trial, adult patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis received up to 48 weeks of treatment with Momenta’s drug, called M923, Humira itself, or Humira alternating with M923. The percentage of patients that achieved at least a 75 percent reduction on an index of psoriasis severity was equivalent between M923 and Humira, meeting the main goal of the study. Momenta developed M923 in collaboration with Baxalta - which is now part of Shire Plc - but in September, Shire decided to end its biosimilars program, and is in the process of transitioning the drug to Momenta.

Speaking at the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, Gonzalez said his company would raise prices just once this year, and the percentage increases would not exceed single digits.  AbbVie, whose rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira is the world’s biggest-selling drug, joins Allergan and Danish diabetes company Novo Nordisk as the first major drugmakers promising such a limit on price increases. “There’s a strong debate going on right now about pricing,” Gonzalez told investors. “We need to make sure we are operating in an appropriate way ... and demonstrating the value of the products that we have.” Drugmakers have come under intense criticism for setting extremely high U.S. prices for new medicines, and for their practice of regularly increasing those prices, often twice a year and by double-digits. While Gonzalez was making his presentation the pricing debate heated up considerably, as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump attacked the pharmaceutical industry during a news conference. Trump said drugmakers were “getting away with murder” and promised to start a bidding process over drug pricing that would save the country billions of dollars. It appeared to be a renewal of a campaign promise Trump made to allow the massive U.S. Medicare health insurance program for the elderly to negotiate drug pricing, something it is currently prohibited by law from doing. Trump’s comments sent shares of pharmaceutical and biotech companies lower. Shares of AbbVie were down 4.0 percent at $60.91 in afternoon trading. Prior to Trump’s news conference, several top pharmaceutical executives at the JP Morgan conference expressed optimism over a Trump administration they see as likely to lower corporate tax rates and allow repatriation of cash held overseas without incurring major penalties. “I’ve never been more hopeful than I am now,” Gonzalez said, while apparently unaware of Trump’s comments at the time. Even with only single-digit price increases, Gonzalez said he expects global sales of Humira to exceed $18 billion by 2020. Humira had sales in 2015 of about $14 billion.

405,ABBV,"Investors in big pharma, biotech look to ride out Trump storm","NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Investors in large U.S. pharmaceutical and biotech companies are counting on strong dividends, reasonable stock valuations and new products to help ride out a storm of political uncertainty as the incoming Trump administration dives into healthcare policy. The sector took a pounding on Wednesday after U.S. president-elect Donald Trump said the drug industry was “getting away with murder” on medicine costs, suggesting that the specter of government actions on pricing is not going away any time soon. The industry faced critical scrutiny during much of the presidential election campaign last year. But despite the potential for political volatility ahead, some investors are finding reasons to hang onto shares of  drugmakers. “We do think they are generating a lot of cash, throwing out a very nice dividend and the valuations are more reasonable than many areas of the market,” said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors in New York, which owns stock in Merck, Pfizer, AbbVie and Gilead . “We definitely are worried and aware” of pricing concerns, Katz said. “But we think when all is said and done they are going to muddle through it - and the stocks are too cheap.” While the S&P; 500 companies are overall trading at prices well above their traditional valuations, a group of pharmaceutical stocks in the index recently has traded at 14.8 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, below their 16.4 average over the past three years, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Shares of Gilead, which also faces questions about its hepatitis C franchise sales, are trading at around 7 times forward earnings, while fellow biotech giant Amgen is trading at 12.5 times. Merck, whose shares have climbed in the past two days after positive developments for its cancer treatment Keytruda, holds a higher P/E ratio of 16.3 times. But even that is lower than the 17 times for the S&P; 500 as a whole. Large drugmakers and a few biotech companies also offer solid dividend payouts. The group of S&P; 500 drugmakers are yielding 2.85 percent, which is above the S&P; 500’s yield of 2.4 percent and slightly ahead of the 2.83 percent for the S&P; 500 consumer staples index, which includes companies known for their high dividends. Drugmakers “have long track records of paying those dividends and regularly increasing them,” said George Strietmann, portfolio manager with Cincinnati investment advisory firm Bahl & Gaynor. “The market looks at that as a very strong part of the foundation of owning the stocks.” Bahl & Gaynor owns shares of AbbVie, which has a dividend yield of 4.2 percent, and Merck, which is yielding 3.1 percent. Smaller biotech and pharma companies do not offer such dividends, leaving them with potentially less cushion than their larger peers should drug-pricing pressures increase. Regardless, Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, said he is “very optimistic” about pharma and biotech, noting that “many of them are extremely beaten down.” “We think it’s a great sector to be in,” Jankovskis said, “and whether we get the benefit of it in the next few months or over the next couple of years, either way we think we’re going to come out ahead.” Some investors remain concerned about the sector. Investors should be wary about companies that derive a lot of revenue from big government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. “We think that investors should really pay attention to where the money comes from in these companies, who the buyer is,” Forrest said.

408,ABBV,AbbVie's revenue miss clouds strong Humira U.S. sales,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) reported quarterly adjusted revenue that missed analysts’ estimates as weaker-than-expected sales of its hepatitis C treatment and cancer therapy overshadowed strong U.S. demand for its flagship drug, Humira. The company’s shares were down 2.57 percent at $59.7 in afternoon trading on Friday, wiping out $2.55 billion of its market value.  AbbVie has sharpened its focus on oncology to reduce its reliance on Humira. The company bought Pharmacyclics and its half-ownership of the leukemia drug, Imbruvica, for $21 billion in 2015.          Sales of the drug, which is also sold by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), fell short of fourth-quarter expectations, partly due to an inventory issue, analysts said. However, AbbVie said it expects 2017 Imbruvica sales of $2.4 billion, up from $1.83 billion last year.  Sales of Abbvie’s hepatitis C treatment, Vikiera Pak, also missed estimates, hurt by competition from Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) and Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N).  The company forecast full-year Vikiera sales of $1 billion, below the $1.52 billion the drug raked in last year.  The sales expectations come when investors are already jittery about looming biosimilar competition for Humira, the world’s top-selling drug. U.S. sales of the autoimmune treatment came in well ahead of analysts’ estimate in the fourth quarter, but international revenue was hit by indirect biosimilar competition in Europe and a strong dollar, analysts said. AbbVie, which is trying to block the U.S. launch of a Humira biosimilar developed by Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), said it expects biosimilar launches in the vast majority of countries in 2018. Chief Financial Officer Bill Chase said the company expected mid-to-high teens growth for Humira in the United States for 2017.  “I don’t see anything on the horizon ... that would give me pause as to the fundamental trajectory of Humira,” Chief Executive Officer Richard Gonzalez said on a post-earnings call. AbbVie has already negotiated with U.S. insurers for Humira coverage in 2017 and 2018. The company earlier this month said it would limit price hikes to once a year and keep them under 10 percent, as political and payer scrutiny into drug pricing intensifies. AbbVie has already hiked prices on a majority of its products for 2017, the company said on the call.  The company has raised Humira’s gross price by 8.4 percent, according to Evercore ISI.  Adjusted quarterly revenue of $6.78 billion came in below analysts’ average estimate of $6.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/. AbbVie said it expected 2017 adjusted earnings of $5.44 to $5.54 per share, compared with analysts’ estimate of $5.47.

419,ABBV,"UPDATE 3-TG Therapeutics' leukemia drug clears key study, shares pop","(Reuters) - TG Therapeutics Inc said a combination of its experimental cancer drug, ublituximab, and approved treatment Imbruvica was found to be more effective in high-risk leukemia patients, compared with Imbruvica as a standalone therapy.  TG’s shares more than doubled in morning trading on Monday. The late-stage study involved adult patients with high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have undergone at least one prior therapy.  The trial was designed to evaluate whether adding ublituximab would induce a statistically significant improvement in overall response rate by at least 20 percent between the two groups of patients. The absolute difference between the two groups was about 30 percent, the company said on Monday. TG said it would meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to discuss accelerated approval. A separate late-stage study testing ublituximab to treat multiple sclerosis is expected to begin later this year, pending the outcome of a mid-stage trial. Ublituximab is also being evaluated in combination with another TG experimental drug, TGR-1202, for use in CLL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  In 2015, AbbVie Inc forked out $21 billion for Pharmacyclics, giving it joint ownership of the blockbuster leukemia treatment, Imbruvica, with Johnson & Johnson. Imbruvica, which is also approved to treat mantle cell lymphoma and a type of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, generated $1.83 billion in sales for AbbVie last year. The American Cancer Society has estimated that about 20,110 cases of CLL will be diagnosed in the United States in 2017, and the disease could claim 4,660 lives. New York-based TG’s shares were up about 87 percent at $10 in morning trading.

428,ABBV,AbbVie cancer drug fails two late-stage trials,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc said on Wednesday that its experimental cancer drug, veliparib, failed to meet the main goals of two late-stage studies. The trials evaluated the effect of veliparib, in combination with a chemotherapy regimen, on patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and triple-negative breast cancer. In one trial, the combination treatment failed to improve the overall survival of NSCLC patients, who had smoked within the past 12 months and had more than 100 smoking events in their lifetime. In another trial, which evaluated the treatment on patients with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer, the drug did not achieve the complete pathologic response. Veliparib belongs to a closely watched class of new medicines called PARP inhibitors, which block enzymes involved in repairing damaged DNA, thereby helping to kill cancer cells. The only approved drugs in the class include AstraZeneca Plc’s Lynparza, also known as olaparib, and Tesaro Inc’s niraparib.

433,ABBV,AbbVie profit beats on Humira demand; cheers Trump tax plan,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly profit, lifted by demand for its flagship drug, Humira, and called President Donald Trump’s tax plan “encouraging”. The company’s shares rose as much as 3.8 percent to $67.50 on Thursday.   The Trump administration on Wednesday unveiled a tax reform blueprint that proposed deep tax cuts for businesses and called for bringing back corporate profits being held offshore at a rate well below the current 35 percent. “We’re incredibly encouraged that there is talk now about possibly allowing repatriation of cash in a tax-efficient manner,” Chief Financial Officer William Chase said on a post-earnings conference call. AbbVie keeps a majority of its cash overseas, Chase said, but declined to provide more details. About $2.6 trillion in profits are being held tax-exempt abroad by U.S. multinationals under a rule that says they are only taxable if brought into the United States.      AbbVie on Thursday reported better-than-expected first-quarter sales for Humira, helping allay investor worries over looming competition for the world’s top-selling drug. U.S. sales jumped nearly 23 percent.   “Unfounded fears on U.S. Humira growth were put to bed,” Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said in a client note titled “Humira bears left out in the cold”.   AbbVie, which is trying to block the U.S. launch of a Humira biosimilar developed by Amgen Inc, said in January that it expected biosimilar launches in multiple countries in 2018. Pricing and volume challenges noted by biopharma companies with immunology drugs do not seem to have impacted Humira to the same degree, which reduces the risk of subsequent revenue misses in 2017, Leerink’s Geoffrey Porges said.   U.S. sales of the drug, which has a list price of $4,441 for a two-pen pack, were driven by volume growth in excess of 12 percent, with the rest from a price increase, company executives said on the call.  Total sales of Humira, used to treat several autoimmune disorders, came in at $4.12 billion, $29 million above consensus estimate, according to Barclays.         The suburban Chicago company’s cancer drug, Imbruvica, raked in first-quarter sales of $551 million, beating the Street estimate, while its hepatitis C treatment, Viekira Pak, brought in a lower-than-expected $263 million. Net revenue rose 9.7 percent to $6.54 billion, just ahead of the average estimate of $6.48 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

440,ABBV,AbbVie's rheumatoid arthritis drug succeeds in trial,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc said on Wednesday its oral rheumatoid arthritis drug succeeded in a late-stage study on patients who had not adequately responded to standard treatments. The drug, upadacitinib, is a once-daily pill belonging to a class of drugs known as JAK inhibitors, which block inflammation-causing enzymes called Janus kinases. Pfizer Inc’s Xeljanz is the only U.S.-approved JAK inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis – a chronic inflammatory disease in which the immune system attacks tissues in the joints, affecting more than 23 million people. AbbVie’s success comes almost two months after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected baricitinib, a rival JAK inhibitor developed by Eli Lilly and Co and Incyte Corp. If approved, upadacitinib could help AbbVie lower its reliance on its flagship rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira – the world’s top selling medicine that will soon face competition from biosimilars in the United States. AbbVie’s shares were up 1.4 percent at $68.81 on Wednesday afternoon. They earlier hit a session high of $69.32, their highest since August 2015. In AbbVie’s 12-week study on upadacitinib, two doses of the drug were tested against a placebo on patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. AbbVie said 64 percent of patients given a 15-milligram dose and 66 percent of patients given a 30-mg dose experienced a 20 percent reduction in symptoms, measured using a commonly used rheumatoid arthritis scale. The company said only 36 percent of patients given a placebo experienced a comparable drop in symptoms, meaning upadacitinib cleared the trial – the first of six testing the drug on patients with various cases of rheumatoid arthritis. As data from the other trials comes in, upadacitinib might prove to be more effective than Lilly and Incyte’s baricitinib, Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said. Rheumatoid arthritis is currently treated with older drugs such as methotrexate, Pfizer’s JAK inhibitor Xeljanz as well as injected biologics such as Amgen Inc’s Enbrel and AbbVie’s Humira. Humira generated more than $16 billion in sales last year, but competition is looming. AbbVie is trying to block the launch of an FDA-approved biosimilar, made by Amgen, arguing that its patents on Humira offered protection until at least 2022. AbbVie is also evaluating upadacitinib for several other autoimmune conditions, including psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Holford estimated peak sales of $3.5 billion for the drug across all diseases. Pfizer’s Xeljanz generated sales of $927 million last year.

445,ABBV,AbbVie must pay $15 million in Depakote birth-defect trial: jury,"(Reuters) - A federal jury on Friday awarded $15 million to a 10-year-old boy whose mother blamed his birth defect on AbbVie Inc’s (ABBV.N) bipolar disorder drug Depakote that she took while pregnant, in the latest trial among hundreds of lawsuits over the product. Jurors in federal court in East St. Louis, Illinois, awarded the compensatory damages to Stevie Gonzalez, who was born with spina bifida. His mother, Christina Raquel, said she was not adequately warned about a risk of birth defects when she took Depakote while pregnant. Jurors awarded no punitive damages during a second phase of the trial, according to court papers. The lawsuit was filed against Abbott Laboratories Inc. AbbVie spun out of Abbott in 2013 and assumed all rights and responsibilities for the drug. About 695 injury claims related to Depakote are pending in federal and state courts, according to AbbVie. In a statement, AbbVie said in several prior cases, “juries have unanimously found that Depakote’s label enables doctors to make properly informed decisions about Depakote’s demonstrated benefits and the clearly disclosed risk of birth defects.” Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In 2012, Abboutt agreed to pay $1.6 billion to resolve federal and state claims that it promoted Depakote for uses that were not approved by U.S. health regulators. In her lawsuit, Raquel claimed that her child was born in 2007 with birth defects after she took Depakote to treat her bipolar disorder while she was pregnant. The lawsuit said Abbott failed to provide adequate warnings to her psychiatrists regarding the risk of birth defects associated with Depakote use. Lawyers for the company said doctors were warned about the drug’s risks. It also argued Raquel cannot prove Depakote caused her child’s injuries. Depakote cases have had mixed results in court. In 2015, a Missouri state court jury awarded 24 plaintiffs $38 million. But a federal jury in Ohio in 2015 cleared Abbott and AbbVie of liability in another lawsuit.

457,ABBV,U.S. jury finds AbbVie liable for misrepresentation in AndroGel verdict,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal jury in Chicago on Monday found AbbVie Inc fraudulently misrepresented the risks of its testosterone replacement drug AndroGel and ordered the drugmaker to pay $150 million in punitive damages. The verdict, which came in response to a lawsuit Jesse Mitchell and his wife filed in 2014, is the first in response to over 6,000 pending lawsuits that have been consolidated in federal court in Chicago. The decision in the Mitchell case is the first in a series of test trials aimed at helping plaintiffs and manufacturers of AndroGel gauge the range of damages and define a legal strategy and settlement options. These so-called bellwether trials are often used in product liability where hundreds of people have similar claims. The jury said AbbVie was not negligent or strictly liable for a heart attack Mitchell suffered after taking AndroGel, but said the company falsely marketed the drug. It did not award Mitchell compensatory damages for his injuries and losses. “The jury found that AndroGel did not cause any damage,” AbbVie said in a statement. The company said that it did not expect the punitive damage award to stand, without providing further details. Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said the jury’s decision to award punitive damages without granting compensatory damages was “extremely unusual.” “Usually you can’t recover punitive damages without having any compensatory damages,” Tobias said. Tobias, who focuses on mass torts and product liability, said the drugmaker is certain to appeal the verdict. But he said that the verdict did not bode well for AbbVie’s remaining trials. “The fact that a jury awarded punitive damages may encourage plaintiffs and their lawyers to bring on more cases and pursue them even more aggressively.” The company’s stock was at $73.9, down 0.96 percent or 72 cents.

461,ABBV,"UPDATE 2-Gilead Sciences profit falls, but beats Wall Street estimates","(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) on Wednesday reported lower second-quarter profits as use of its flagship hepatitis C drugs continued to decline, but the results still beat Wall Street estimates and the company raised its full-year sales outlook. After one-time items, Gilead earned $2.56 a share. Wall Street analysts, on average, had forecast adjusted earnings of $2.15 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “People had a sense they were going to beat on the HCV (hepatitis C) side and that’s where most of it came from,” said Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges. But with a rival drug from AbbVie Inc ABBV.O likely to be approved by regulators next month, the stronger sales trend is unlikely to continue, he said. Gilead’s quarterly sales of hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa totaled $2.9 billion, down from $4 billion a year earlier, but above the $2.23 billion forecast by analysts. Chief Executive John Milligan, on a conference call with investors and analysts, said the competitive threat hinges on “unknowns” including AbbVie’s pricing, how it promotes its drug and contracts with health insurers and other payers. Gilead warned earlier this year that sales of its high-priced hepatitis C drugs were declining as fewer patients were deemed eligible for treatment and competition grew. Second-quarter sales of other antiviral products, including Gilead’s other main franchise of HIV drugs, rose to $3.6 billion from $3.1 billion for the same period in 2016. Gilead raised its full-year 2017 product sales estimate to between $24 billion and $25.5 billion, up from a previous range of $22.5 billion to $24.5 billion. Milligan said Gilead was confident in its prospects for both the HIV and HCV markets but has been “very, very active” in assessing other potential business opportunities. “When the things are right for us, we will announce them,” he said. “It is very clear that they are preparing themselves to be much more acquisitive,” Porges said, citing actions including scaled back share buybacks and cuts in research spending. Net income fell to $3.1 billion from $3.5 billion in the year-ago quarter. Overall revenue fell to $7.14 billion from $7.78 billion. Shares of Gilead, which closed at $74.19 on Nasdaq, were flat in after-hours trading.

465,ABBV,"AbbVie to remain cautious on drug pricing, shares fall","(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc’s (ABBV.N) said it would be cautious with drug pricing, especially for Humira, the world’s biggest selling drug, sending its shares down 2 percent, despite the drugmaker’s quarterly profit narrowly beating estimates. Abbvie CEO Richard Gonzalez said on Friday the company would continue to be “careful and conservative” about pricing, even though the drugmaker has already concluded negotiations with insurers for coverage of its Humira drug in 2017 and 2018.  “I’d say even in this last cycle, we have been even a little more conservative than we have been in the past because this (drug pricing) has become such a heated topic in the United States,” Gonzalez said. AbbVie had in January pledged to limit drug price hikes to under 10 percent and once a year, as political and payer scrutiny into drug pricing intensified in United States. Overall sales of Humira, which is used to treat autoimmune disorders and has a list price of $4,441 for a two-pen pack, rose 13.7 percent to $4.72 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $4.64 billion, according to Barclays. The drug’s U.S. sales rose 18 percent, driven by pricing as well as low double-digit prescription growth, AbbVie executives said.  However, the blockbuster drug faces looming competition from copycat versions in the United States. AbbVie has been trying to block the launch of Amgen’s (AMGN.O) Humira knock-off.  Earlier this year, the U.S. patent office ruled in favor of Coherus Biosciences’ (CHRS.O) Humira copy, in a move that analysts say could advance its U.S. launch by a year. AbbVie’s cancer drug Imbruvica, which it jointly owns with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), raked in sales of $626 million, above the consensus estimate of $609 million. Sales of its hepatitis C treatment, Viekira Pak, came at $225 million, well below the consensus estimate of $257 million, as rival products from Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) and Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) ate into sales.  AbbVie said regulatory decisions on its next-generation hepatitis C treatment, Maviret, are expected in the coming weeks. If approved, the company expects to see a meaningful impact to sales only in 2018.   Excluding items, the company earned $1.42 per share, beating analysts’ estimates by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. AbbVie’s net revenue rose to $6.94 billion, edging past estimates of $6.93 billion.

475,ABBV,"Samsung, Biogen version of AbbVie's Humira approved in Europe","(Reuters) - A biosimilar version of AbbVie Inc’s blockbuster arthritis drug Humira, produced by a joint venture of Biogen Inc and Samsung Biologics, was approved by European Union regulators, the partners said on Thursday. The new drug, Imraldi, marks the third European Commission approval for “biosimilar” versions from the joint venture, Samsung Bioepis, of drugs in a class known as TNF inhibitors. Biosimilar copies of expensive biotech drugs are gaining momentum in Europe, which has been faster to adopt their use than the United States, and their potential to take business from companies making the original products is being monitored closely by investors.  Imraldi was approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, pediatric plaque psoriasis, adult and adolescent hidradenitis suppurativa, Crohn’s disease, pediatric Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis. “As the number of approved biosimilars continues to grow, so does the anticipated potential to increase physician choice and patient access to biologics,” Jean-Paul Kress, head of global therapeutic options at Biogen, said in a statement. Last year, Samsung Bioepis received European Commission marketing authorization for Benepali, a biosimilar version of Amgen Inc’s Enbrel, and for Flixabi, a version of Remicade, which is sold by Johnson & Johnson. Earlier this year, Amgen won European approval for the first copy of Humira, also called adalimumab.

476,ABBV,"UPDATE 1-Samsung, Biogen version of AbbVie's Humira approved in Europe","(Reuters) - A biosimilar version of AbbVie Inc’s blockbuster arthritis drug Humira, produced by a joint venture of Biogen Inc and Samsung Biologics, was approved by European Union regulators, the partners said on Thursday. The new drug, Imraldi, marks the third European Commission approval for “biosimilar” versions from the joint venture, Samsung Bioepis, of drugs in a class known as TNF inhibitors. Biosimilar copies of expensive biotech drugs are gaining momentum in Europe, which has been faster to adopt their use than the United States, and their potential to take business from companies making the original products is being monitored closely by investors.  Imraldi was approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, pediatric plaque psoriasis, adult and adolescent hidradenitis suppurativa, Crohn’s disease, pediatric Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis. “As the number of approved biosimilars continues to grow, so does the anticipated potential to increase physician choice and patient access to biologics,” Jean-Paul Kress, head of global therapeutic options at Biogen, said in a statement. Last year, Samsung Bioepis received European Commission marketing authorization for Benepali, a biosimilar version of Amgen Inc’s Enbrel, and for Flixabi, a version of Remicade, which is sold by Johnson & Johnson. Earlier this year, Amgen won European approval for the first copy of Humira, also called adalimumab.

482,ABBV,AbbVie's positive eczema study drags down Regeneron's shares,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc said on Thursday its experimental drug to treat adults with moderate-to-severe eczema met the main goal in a mid-stage study, dragging down shares of rival U.S. biotech firm Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic skin inflammation, which in severe cases causes constant and often unbearable itching. Regeneron’s eczema drug, Dupixent, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March. AbbVie’s mid-stage trial data for its drug, upadacitinib, seemed comparable to Dupixent’s late-stage data, but the difference in the two studies’ sample sizes made direct comparisons imprecise, Jefferies analyst Berin Amin said. “Nonetheless, we expect upadacitinib to compete with Dupixent,” Amin added. Upadacitinib showed a statistically significant improvement in reducing both the severity of eczema in patients and the amount of body area affected by the disease, AbbVie said. Shares of AbbVie, which plans a late-stage study for upadacitinib next year, were up 2.8 percent at $79.23 in late morning trading. Regeneron’s shares were down 5.2 percent at $474.08.

486,ABBV,AbbVie says deaths in arthritis trial not linked to drug,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc said on Monday two patients died in a late-stage trial of its rheumatoid arthritis drug but that the deaths were not linked to the drug, which met the study’s main goals. The trial was evaluating two doses of the drug upadacitinib - 15 mg and 30 mg - in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, who did not adequately respond to or were intolerant to other anti-rheumatic drugs. Upadacitinib, a once-daily pill, belongs to a class of drugs known as JAK inhibitors, which block inflammation-causing enzymes called Janus kinases and are being used to treat rheumatoid arthritis among other diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic inflammatory disease in which the immune system attacks tissues in the joints, affects more than 23 million people. “Following the second positive phase 3 trial ... we believe this drug has the potential to be the best-in-class JAK inhibitor. We remain comfortable with its safety profile, “ Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford wrote in a client note. If approved, Upadacitinib could reduce AbbVie’s dependence on its flagship rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira, which generated more than $16 billion in sales last year. The drugmaker said the reason for one of the deaths was unknown, while the second patient died due to heart failure and presumed pulmonary embolism, or blood clots in the lungs. “At the time of initial report, both events were considered by the investigator as having no reasonable possibility of being related to the study drug,” AbbVie’s spokeswoman Jillian Griffin told Reuters. Eli Lilly and Co’s rival rheumatoid arthritis drug, baricitinib, also a JAK inhibitor, hit a roadblock in April when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration declined to approve it, calling for an additional clinical study. Three months later, Lilly said the FDA was concerned about a small, but increased number of potentially dangerous blood clots seen in baricitinib patients in clinical trials, outlining a likely multi-year delay for the drug.

496,ABBV,"AbbVie, Amgen settlement sets Humira U.S. biosimilar launch for 2023","(Reuters) - Amgen Inc has reached a settlement with AbbVie Inc that will delay the U.S. launch of Amgen’s cheaper biosimilar version of AbbVie’s cash cow, the blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, until Jan. 31, 2023, the companies said on Thursday. Humira, known chemically as adalimumab, is by far the world’s top-selling prescription medicine with second-quarter global sales of $4.7 billion, putting it on track for annual sales exceeding $18 billion. The settlement, which removes a major overhang for AbbVie given its dependence on Humira, sent its shares to an all-time high of $90.95 before settling back to $89.87, up 6 percent. Under terms of the settlement, which ends all pending patent litigation between the companies, AbbVie said it will be entitled to unspecified royalties on sales of Amgen’s biosimilar of Humira. The Humira settlement “adds unexpected royalties during the biosimilar years and indicates that AbbVie’s patents ... are defensible,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said in a research note. The settlement also allows Amgen to begin selling its biosimilar of Humira in Europe on Oct. 16, 2018. “This agreement will allow us to secure a strong foothold in the $4 billion European adalimumab market,” Scott Foraker, head of biosimilars for Amgen, said in a statement. Amgen shares were up 0.7 percent at $186.19. Amgen was the first company to win U.S. approval for a Humira biosimilar, but delayed selling it until the patent situation was resolved. Other companies that also intend to market their own biosimilar versions of Humira are still challenging its patents. “We believe that this could be a leading indicator for other ongoing litigation with adalimumab biosimilar manufacturers,” Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham said. Biosimilars are intended to be less costly versions of expensive biotechnology medicines.

499,ABBV,Second U.S. jury finds AbbVie misrepresented risks of AndroGel,"(Reuters) - A U.S. jury on Thursday ordered AbbVie Inc to pay more than $140 million to a man who claimed the company misrepresented the risks of its testosterone replacement drug AndroGel, causing him to suffer a heart attack, the plaintiff’s lawyer said in a statement. The verdict, handed down in federal court in Chicago, came in a lawsuit Tennessee resident Jeffrey Konrad and his wife filed in 2015. It is the second verdict against AbbVie to come out of more than 6,000 similar lawsuits against AbbVie and other companies consolidated in the Chicago court. “We are disappointed with today’s verdict and we intend to appeal,” Chicago-based AbbVie said in a statement. Thursday’s verdict was comprised of $140 million in punitive damages, intended to deter the defendant and others from engaging in similar behavior, and $140,000 in compensatory damages, according to David Buchanan, an attorney for Konrad. Konrad’s case is part of a series of test trials aimed at helping plaintiffs and manufacturers of AndroGel gauge the range of damages and define a legal strategy and settlement options. Plaintiffs across the country claim AndroGel can cause heart attacks, strokes and other injuries. AbbVie has said that its marketing of AndroGel adhered strictly to uses approved by the Food and Drug Administration and that it was in full compliance with applicable standards. A federal jury in another case in July found AbbVie fraudulently misrepresented the drug’s risk and ordered the company to pay $150 million in punitive damages.  That jury’s decision to award punitive damages without granting compensatory damages was unusual and both sides continue to fight over the verdict’s validity in court. Konrad, 56, had been using AndroGel for two months in 2010 when he suffered a heart attack. He has since recovered from his injuries. In court papers, the company contended that Konrad’s heart attack was caused by other factors, such as obesity and high blood pressure. It also said it made no misrepresentations about AndroGel’s safety. AbbVie’s AndroGel is one of the dominant testosterone treatments on the market, with sales of $675 million in 2016. In 2014, the FDA convened an advisory committee to consider the adverse cardiovascular outcomes associated with testosterone replacement therapy. On the committee’s recommendation, the FDA required AbbVie to add a warning about cardiovascular risk to AndroGel’s label in May 2015.

The verdict, handed down in federal court in Chicago, came in a lawsuit Tennessee resident Jeffrey Konrad and his wife filed in 2015. It is the second verdict against AbbVie to come out of more than 6,000 similar lawsuits against AbbVie and other companies consolidated in the Chicago court. “We are disappointed with today’s verdict and we intend to appeal,” Chicago-based AbbVie said in a statement. Thursday’s verdict was comprised of $140 million in punitive damages, intended to deter the defendant and others from engaging in similar behavior, and $140,000 in compensatory damages, according to David Buchanan, an attorney for Konrad. Konrad’s case is part of a series of test trials aimed at helping plaintiffs and manufacturers of AndroGel gauge the range of damages and define a legal strategy and settlement options. Plaintiffs across the country claim AndroGel can cause heart attacks, strokes and other injuries. AbbVie has said that its marketing of AndroGel adhered strictly to uses approved by the Food and Drug Administration and that it was in full compliance with applicable standards. A federal jury in another case in July found AbbVie fraudulently misrepresented the drug’s risk and ordered the company to pay $150 million in punitive damages.  That jury’s decision to award punitive damages without granting compensatory damages was unusual and both sides continue to fight over the verdict’s validity in court. Konrad, 56, had been using AndroGel for two months in 2010 when he suffered a heart attack. He has since recovered from his injuries. In court papers, the company contended that Konrad’s heart attack was caused by other factors, such as obesity and high blood pressure. It also said it made no misrepresentations about AndroGel’s safety. AbbVie’s AndroGel is one of the dominant testosterone treatments on the market, with sales of $675 million in 2016. In 2014, the FDA convened an advisory committee to consider the adverse cardiovascular outcomes associated with testosterone replacement therapy. On the committee’s recommendation, the FDA required AbbVie to add a warning about cardiovascular risk to AndroGel’s label in May 2015.

504,ABBV,"REFILE-UPDATE 1-US NIH, 11 drugmakers partner to accelerate cancer therapy research","(Adds advisory: updates with comments from news conference, byline) By Julie Steenhuysen Oct 12 (Reuters) - The Trump Administration threw its support behind a public-private partnership with 11 drug companies to advance a new class of drugs that uses the body’s immune system to fight cancer. The five-year collaboration is part of the Cancer Moonshot, a program started during the Obama administration and led by former Vice President Joe Biden, whose son Beau died of brain cancer. The Partnership for Accelerating Cancer Therapies or PACT will devote $215 million to identify and test chemical signatures in the body that will help predict which patients will benefit from cancer immunotherapy. Drug industry partners include AbbVie, Roche Holding AG and Bristol-Myers Squibb, whose drug Opdivo works by enlisting the body’s defenses to fight tumors. Merck & Co Inc, whose Keytruda leads the fast-expanding field of immunotherapies, is not involved. In a Thursday press conference announcing the collaboration, Reed Cordish, who heads the Office of American Innovation, an initiative led by President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, said the program represents the “type of collaboration and partnership between the private sector and government that this administration is trying to foster across many sectors.” Eric Hargan, the newly tapped Acting Secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, told reporters: “Under President Trump, we are going to continue making significant investments in cancer cures. Advancing great American medicine and science is a top, top priority for this administration.” Plans for the partnership began two years ago under the leadership of Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health. Collins said the group will work to explain why cancer immunotherapies, which have transformed treatment for melanoma, leukemia and some other cancers, do not work for more patients. “By standardizing and validating biomarkers for immunotherapy while also developing and exploring new biomarkers, we hope to advance rapidly toward a new future of precision oncology that benefits all patients,” Collins told the briefing. Pfizer Inc, Johnson & Johnson, Amgen Inc , Celgene Corp, Gilead Sciences Inc and GlaxoSmithKline Plc are part of the effort, NIH said. The 11 partners would contribute up to $55 million, while NIH would add about $160 million, based on availability of funds. The partnership will be managed by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health.

507,ABBV,AbbVie bets on Alzheimer's immunotherapy with big biotech deal,"(Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker AbbVie is betting on the potential of the body’s immune system to fight Alzheimer’s by signing a drug development deal worth more than $200 million with unlisted biotech company Alector. AbbVie said on Tuesday it was paying $205 million upfront and could make a further $20 million equity investment to work with San Francisco-based Alector on the new approach to tackling the memory-robbing disease. The idea of using immunotherapy in Alzheimer’s mirrors the success of immuno-oncology in cancer, where drugs that help the immune system battle tumors are revolutionizing care. Scientists at AbbVie and Alector believe there is growing evidence that immune deficiencies within the central nervous system play an important role in the progression of  neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s. “We anticipate that immuno-neurology therapies will have as much of an impact on brain disorders as immuno-oncology is having on cancer,” said Alector’s chief executive, Arnon Rosenthal. The novel research effort comes against the backdrop of a series of failures in other attempts to fight Alzheimer’s, although the development of immune-based treatments is still at a very early stage. Under the terms of the agreement AbbVie and Alector have agreed to research a portfolio of antibody targets and AbbVie has an option on global development and commercial rights to two targets. Assuming drugs from the program eventually make it to marker, the two companies will share profits equally. Alector was founded in 2013 and is backed by investors including OrbiMed, Polaris, Google Ventures, Topspin Partners and Mission Bay Capital, as well as drugmakers Merck, AbbVie and Amgen.

AbbVie also reported third-quarter earnings above Wall Street estimates, as it sold more of Humira — the world’s best selling prescription medicine — and Imbruvica, its other main drug. The company also raised its annual earnings forecast. Humira, which is approved to treat psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, generated sales of $4.70 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, topping analysts’ average estimate of $4.66 billion, according to analysts at Jefferies. The drug raked in just over $16 billion last year. “In a very choppy earnings season, have to hand it to AbbVie for delivering,” Evercore ISI analyst Joshua Schimmer said. Last month, AbbVie reassured investors that Humira would be safe from competition for at least a few more years, granting rival Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) a non-exclusive license to sell a copycat version in the United States, but not before 2023. However, on a call with analysts, AbbVie talked up the potential of its other drugs. The drugmaker said cancer treatments such as Imbruvica and Rova-T - which is in development - will drive future growth and help lower its reliance on Humira, which makes up two-thirds of overall sales. AbbVie expects non-Humira sales to exceed $35 billion by 2025 from about $9.6 billion this year. It also expects to launch more than 20 products by 2020. AbbVie’s growth should be sustainable for the next few years as its drug pipeline develops, Evercore ISI’s Schimmer said. The Chicago-based company is also targeting Alzheimer’s disease, the women’s health space and Hepatitis C. Two of its other drugs - upadacitinib and risankizumab - have been successful in recent trials, possibly opening up billion-dollar markets if approved by regulators. AbbVie’s shares, up 43 percent so far this year, were up 3.7 percent at $92.91 in late morning trading on Friday. The company’s net earnings rose 2.1 percent to $1.63 billion in the third quarter. Excluding one-time items, it earned $1.41 per share, topping analysts’ expectations of $1.38, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

518,ABBV,"Roche, AbbVie leukemia drug superior to older medicine in study","(Reuters) - Patients with a type of leukemia that had relapsed who received the new drug Venclexta in combination with Rituxan went significantly longer without the disease worsening than those treated with Rituxan and Treanda, according to interim results from a pivotal late stage study released on Tuesday. Venclexta, sold by Roche and AbbVie, received an accelerated approval to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with a specific genetic mutation who received at least one prior therapy. But its continued approval, which was based only on overall response rates seen in an earlier trial, may be contingent on confirmation of clinical benefit. The Phase III interim data being presented next month at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting in Atlanta may go a long way to providing that confirmation. In the study of 389 patients whose CLL had relapsed after up to three prior treatment regimens, median time until disease worsening, or progression-free survival (PFS), was 17 months for Rituxan plus Treanda, know generically as bendamustine. Median PFS was not yet reached after two years of treatment with the Venclexta combination, including in high-risk patients. “The primary analysis of the first Phase III study of Venclexta in relapsed/refractory CLL shows a profound improvement in PFS versus standard bendamustine/Rituxan, with consistent effects in all-risk subsets,” researchers concluded in a brief summary of interim data released on Tuesday. The overall response rate was 93.3 percent for Venclexta  plus Rituxan versus 67.7 percent who responded to Treanda/Rituxan. A complete response, meaning no detectable sign of cancer based on bone marrow assessment and CT scan, was observed in 26.8 percent of those who received Venclexta (venetoclax) plus Rituxan versus 8.2 percent of those in the control group. The results were deemed to be highly statistically significant. Adverse reactions leading to deaths were reported in 10 Venclexta patients (5.2 percent) and 11 in the Treanda group (5.9 percent). CLL is a slowly progressing blood cancer that primarily affects older adults. About 20,000 new cases of CLL are diagnosed in the United States each year, according to the American Cancer Society.

523,ABBV,U.S. judge tosses verdict against AbbVie in AndroGel case,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday overturned a $150 million verdict against  AbbVie Inc that was the first to result from lawsuits  claiming that the company fraudulently misrepresented the risks of its testosterone replacement drug AndroGel. U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly in Chicago ruled that the findings by the jury that rendered the verdict in July in favor of Oregon resident Jesse Mitchell were “logically incompatible.” The jury awarded Mitchell $150 million in punitive damages even though it did not award him any compensatory damages. The verdict came in one of around 4,510 cases AbbVie says it faces nationally over injuries blamed on AndroGel. The jury concluded that AbbVie was not negligent or strictly liable for a heart attack that Mitchell said he suffered after using AndroGel, but concluded that the company falsely marketed the drug. “The irreconcilable conflict between the jury’s finding of liability on the fraudulent misrepresentation claim and award of zero compensatory damages requires a new trial on this claim,” Kennelly wrote. Kennelly also vacated the punitive damages award. He scheduled a new trial to take place on March 5. Christopher Seeger, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the litigation, said they looked forward to re-trying the case. Chicago-based AbbVie did not respond to requests for comment. The verdict was the first to emerge from a series of test trials in the federal litigation consolidated before Kennelly aimed at helping both sides gauge the range of damages and define settlement options. A second jury in October ordered AbbVie to pay $140 million in punitive damages and $140,000 in compensatory damages in the case of a Tennessee man who claimed the drug caused him to suffer a heart attack. Mitchell suffered a heart attack in 2012 after almost five years of treatment with AndroGel, but recovered after several months, according to his lawsuit. Other pharmaceutical companies are facing similar lawsuits over their testosterone replacement therapies. Eli Lilly and Co, which makes Axiron and as of November faced 538 lawsuits, has reached a global settlement ahead of the first trial it was scheduled to face in January, according to a court filing on Thursday. Terms were not disclosed. Lilly did not respond to a request for comment. In November, jurors sided with Endo International Plc by finding that its Auxilium unit was not responsible for the heart attack a man suffered while using the company’s testosterone replacement drug Testim.

525,ABBV,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-U.S. judge tosses verdict against AbbVie in AndroGel case,"(In 2nd paragraph, corrects quote to say “incompatible,” not “impossible”) By Nate Raymond Dec 22 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday overturned a $150 million verdict against  AbbVie Inc that was the first to result from lawsuits  claiming that the company fraudulently misrepresented the risks of its testosterone replacement drug AndroGel. U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly in Chicago ruled that the findings by the jury that rendered the verdict in July in favor of Oregon resident Jesse Mitchell were “logically incompatible.” The jury awarded Mitchell $150 million in punitive damages even though it did not award him any compensatory damages.

Because the punitive damages award depended on the jury’s finding AbbVie liable, Kennelly also vacated the award. He scheduled a new trial to take place on March 5.

530,ABBV,"Drugmaker AbbVie boosts 2018 forecast, shares soar to record high","(Reuters) - Drugmaker AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) significantly boosted its 2018 earnings forecast on Friday with help from U.S. tax reform and said it hopes to accelerate dividend growth and share buybacks, sending its stock soaring to an all-time high. Shares of AbbVie, maker of the best-selling rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, climbed 10 percent to $118.90 after earlier reaching $120.01, a record high since its split from Abbott Labs (ABT.N) five years ago. The company, which has been building a promising portfolio of drugs to lessen its dependence on cash cow Humira, forecast  full-year adjusted earnings of $7.33 to $7.43 per share for 2918, up from its prior view of $6.37 to $6.57. It projected 2018 revenue of $32 billion, $1 billion higher than the current Wall Street consensus. “We expected an upward 2018 guidance revision, but not of this magnitude,” said Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford, calling it “jaw dropping” in a research note. AbbVie forecast first-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.70 to $1.79 per share, well above Wall Street estimates of $1.50, according to Thomson Reuters data. Chief Executive Officer Rick Gonzalez said the benefits of U.S. tax reform, continued growth of Humira, the world’s top-selling prescription medicine, and surprising strength of Mavyret for hepatitis C, and other new products led to the new profit outlook. With a cheaper corporate tax rate and access to cash overseas that can now be spent in the United States, Gonzalez said he planned to talk to the board about accelerating the rate it raises its dividend and boosting share buybacks. “I sleep well at night knowing how well we are performing” and how things look for the future, Gonzalez said on a conference call. Satisfied with the near-term pipeline, he said AbbVie would be in the market for deals that could help drive growth in the 2023-2025 time frame.  The company, whose stock has been on a tear, now has a market value of about $172.6 billion, surpassing industry stalwart Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) at about $167.2 billion. AbbVie projected an adjusted effective 2018 tax rate of 9 percent, gradually growing to 13 percent over five years. The company plans to invest about $2.5 billion over the next five years in U.S. capital projects and consider expanding facilities in the United States. It also plans to spend $350 million on charitable contributions, including helping to rebuild hurricane ravaged Puerto Rico, $750 million in accelerated pension funding, and an undisclosed amount for enhanced compensation for employees. Sales of Humira, which could soon begin facing competition from biosimilars, rose 14 percent to $4.89 billion for the quarter, helped by price increases.  The company has forecast Humira sales reaching $21 billion by 2020. Imbruvica, the leukemia drug AbbVie shares with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), had sales of $708 million. AbbVie said it expects to file for U.S. approval of its other cancer drug Venclexta for acute myeloid leukemia later this year, noting the approval could come two years ahead of its initial expectations. Based on promising data, the company also sees Venclexta in combination with Roche’s (ROG.S) Rituxan becoming a new chemotherapy-free standard treatment for relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  Excluding items, AbbVie earned $1.48 per share for the quarter, topping the analyst average estimate by 4 cents.

534,ABBV,AbbVie's quarterly profit plunges on $1.14 bln tax charge,"Jan 26 (Reuters) - AbbVie Inc, the maker of world’s best-selling prescription drug, said on Friday its fourth-quarter profit plunged as it recorded a $1.14 billion charge due to changes in U.S. tax policy. Net earnings fell to $52 million, or 3 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1.39 billion, or 85 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, AbbVie earned $1.48 per share. The company, however, raised its forecast for 2018 on expected gains from lower taxes. AbbVie now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to be between $7.33 and $7.43, higher than its prior forecast of $6.37-$6.57. Net revenue in the quarter rose about 14 percent to $7.74 billion, driven by higher sales for its blockbuster drug Humira, which continued to benefit from AbbVie’s aggressive patent strategy to fend off competition. The autoimmune drug that has been in the market for almost 15 years raked in $4.89 billion in the quarter, beating consensus sales estimates of $4.83 billion, according to brokerage Evercore ISI. It was not clear how many analysts were polled. The drugmaker said it expected revenue of about $32 billion in 2018. Humira, which is used to treat psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, is expected to dominate the U.S. market and remain unrivaled until 2023. In October, the company forecast sales of Humira to touch $21 billion by 2020. AbbVie’s efforts to boost its cancer drug pipeline by expanding the use of Imbruvica, which accounted for about 9 percent of its revenue in 2017, could be a focus in 2018, analysts said. Imbruvica earned $708 million in sales, narrowly missing Evercore ISI consensus estimates by $1 million. AbbVie also said it planned to invest about $2.5 billion over the next five years in capital projects and expand its facilities in the United States.

535,ABBV,AbbVie wins U.S. trial in lawsuit over AndroGel's risks,"(Reuters) - A federal jury in Chicago on Friday found AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) not liable in a lawsuit by an Arizona man who claimed he had suffered a pulmonary embolism due to using the company’s testosterone replacement medication AndroGel. The verdict in the lawsuit by Robert Nolte was the third to date in federal court in litigation over AndroGel, a drug approved for men whose bodies produce low or no testosterone that has become the subject of lawsuits by thousands of people. “Our trial team did an excellent job with a very complicated case,” Christopher Seeger, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in federal litigation, said on Friday. “We look forward to the next trial and holding AbbVie accountable for putting profits before safety.” Chicago-based AbbVie did not respond to a request for comment. AbbVie says it faces 4,510 cases nationally over injuries blamed on AndroGel. The verdict came in one of a series of test trials in federal litigation over AndroGel aimed at helping both sides gauge the range of damages and define settlement options. A federal jury in July awarded an Oregon man $150 million in  punitive damages but awarded him no compensatory damages. A federal judge in December tossed the award and ordered a new trial. A second jury in October ordered AbbVie to pay $140 million in punitive damages and $140,000 in compensatory damages in the case of a Tennessee man who claimed the drug caused him to suffer a heart attack. AbbVie is challenging that verdict. The latest trial stemmed from a lawsuit filed in 2014 by Nolte, who suffered an embolism two months after he began using AndroGel, which he was prescribed for the off-label use of treating a drop in testosterone levels, according to court papers. Nolte said AbbVie fraudulently misrepresented the drug’s risk and misled patients by marketing AndroGel on television for off-label use. AbbVie has said that its marketing of AndroGel adhered strictly to uses approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and that it was in full compliance with applicable standards.

536,ABBV,UPDATE 3-Amgen profit misses Street view; sees broad tax reform benefits,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) on Thursday reported a fourth-quarter profit well below Wall Street estimates, hurt by a steep decline in sales of blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel and higher-than-expected expenses, and its shares fell nearly 2 percent. But the world’s biggest biotechnology company provided a 2018 earnings forecast range with a midpoint that easily exceeded analysts’ estimates and announced a $10 billion share repurchase program and a lower effective tax rate due to U.S. tax reform. “The benefits of tax reform will be quite broad,” Chief Executive Robert Bradway said. Excluding items, Amgen earned $2.89 per share, 14 cents below analysts’ average expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For 2018, Amgen forecast adjusted earnings per share of $12.60 to $13.70 and revenue of $21.8 billion to $22.8 billion. Analysts were looking for $12.71 per share and $22.8 billion in revenue. Wider-than-usual forecast ranges were due in part to uncertainty over Sensipar, a secondary hyperparathyroidism drug that could lose patent protection as early as March, Chief Financial Officer David Meline said.  “We’re all waiting for them to do at least a modest-size deal. They need another product or two,” said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt. Amgen projected a 2018 adjusted tax rate of 14 percent to 15 percent. Other large drugmakers have announced rates of about 17 percent or 18 percent. AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) surprised investors  by announcing a 9 percent adjusted tax rate, rising to 13 percent over five years. Amgen plans capital investments of about $3.5 billion over the next five years, with 75 percent in the United States. The company said it decided to build a new biomanufacturing plant in the United States and will add jobs to build and run the facility. Revenue fell 3 percent to $5.8 billion, about in line with analysts’ expectations. Enbrel sales fell 13 percent to $1.37 billion due to lower demand and net selling price in a highly competitive market. Sales of infection fighter Neulasta were flat at $1.11 billion. Prolia for osteoporosis grew 24 percent to $463 million. The company incurred $79 million in expenses in Puerto Rico for Hurricane Maria recovery and additional incremental expenses related to tax planning. It posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $4.26 billion, or $5.89 per share, as it took a $6.1 billion charge related to U.S. tax reform. That compared with a profit of $1.93 billion, or $2.59 per share, a year ago. Amgen shares fell to $182.07 from a Nasdaq close at $185.56.

Zinbryta was approved by the U.S. regulators in 2016 with a boxed warning due to risks of liver damage, with Biogen selling the self-administered drug in Switzerland, Canada and the EU and AbbVie in the U.S. In November, the European regulator flagged safety concerns about the drug restricting its usage to reduce the risk of serious liver damage. The EMA said on Friday it initiated an urgent review of Zinbryta following seven cases of serious brain disorders in Germany and one in Spain. (bit.ly/2CUHj8k) The drug, which currently treats about 3,000 patients globally, brought in worldwide sales of $107 million last year, with Biogen’s share being $53 million. “Although the new safety signals are unfortunate, the opportunity for Zinbryta was never significant given the profile and competitive treatment landscape in multiple sclerosis,” William Blair analyst Matt Phipps said in a note. Phipps had previously estimated the drug to bring in $56 million for Biogen this year. Biogen’s 2017 earnings were slightly impacted by the impairment of Zinbryta-related assets as a result of a previous EMA regulatory procedure to minimize risks of liver damage linked to the drug. Zinbryta became part of the national political debate over high U.S. drug costs in September, when Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings asked the government to take action on the drug’s $87,000 price tag.

557,ABBV,AbbVie's lung cancer drug data disappoints; shares slump,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc’s experimental lung cancer drug data was not effective enough to seek a faster approval, in a setback to the company’s efforts to build its cancer drug pipeline and cut dependence on its blockbuster Humira.  The company’s shares were down 10.8 percent at $100.29 in early trading, shedding about $19 billion in market value. AbbVie has been building a portfolio of oncology drugs to counter competitive threats to its rheumatoid arthritis treatment, Humira, which accounts for about two-thirds of its overall sales. The company said on Thursday it would not seek accelerated approval for the drug, Rova-T, after consulting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration based on “magnitude of effect across multiple parameters”. “You’ve got okay response rate, no evidence that there are long-term survivors and then you have a pretty onerous side effect burden,” Leerink Partners analyst Geoffrey Porges told Reuters. The mid-stage study tested Rova-T as a treatment for small cell lung cancer patients who failed to respond to at least two prior regimens. Rova-T, which AbbVie acquired with its $5.8 billion purchase of Stemcentrx in 2016, is expected to generate sales of $1.2 billion in 2023, according to Thomson Reuters estimates. “(AbbVie) needs something that is the cornerstone of the oncology franchise that they own and Rova-T was meant to be that,” Porges said. “And now that cornerstone is cracked you wonder if they don’t have to go out and find something else.” Late-stage trials testing the drug as a treatment for patients who have either failed to respond to initial treatment or are newly diagnosed will continue, the company said. Rova-T is a toxic chemical that is loaded onto an antibody to target a protein called DLL3 found in more than 80 percent of patients with the cancer. The FDA’s accelerated approval program is meant for drugs that treat serious conditions based on a marker that is expected to lead to a clinical benefit. Guggenheim Securities analyst Tony Butler said AbbVie will likely have to run a bigger trial that will cost more and will need to have a control arm.  “They wanted to do this with a relatively small number of patients and not have to run a control or a big study. That strategy is now thrown out.” ",3222018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-abbvie-study/abbvies-lung-cancer-drug-data-disappoints-shares-slump-idUSKBN1GY1R9

559,ABBV,U.S. jury orders AbbVie to pay $3 million in AndroGel retrial,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. jury on Monday ordered AbbVie Inc to pay more than $3 million to a man who claimed the company misrepresented the risks of its testosterone replacement drug AndroGel, causing him to suffer a heart attack, though the jury did not find AbbVie strictly liable. The verdict in federal court in Chicago came down in the second trial over claims by Oregon resident Jesse Mitchell after U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly in December tossed a previous $150 million jury verdict for being “logically incompatible.” It is the second verdict against AbbVie in the consolidated litigation over testosterone replacement products by the Chicago-based company and other drugmakers. More than 6,000 similar lawsuits have been filed, the bulk of them against AbbVie.  In a separate trial, a federal jury in January found AbbVie not liable in a lawsuit by an Arizona man who claimed he had suffered a pulmonary embolism as a result of using AndroGel. According to court filings, the jury on Monday concluded that AbbVie had not falsely marketed the drug and was not strictly liable, but found that the company acted negligently. It awarded Mitchell $200,000 in compensatory damages and $3 million in punitive damages. AbbVie in a statement said it was disappointed with the verdict and intends to appeal. Lawyers for Mitchell did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the verdict. Mitchell suffered a heart attack in 2012 after almost five years of treatment with AndroGel, but recovered after several months, according to his lawsuit. In the first AndroGel decision against AbbVie, a jury in October ordered the company to pay more than $140 million to a Tennessee man who claimed the drug caused him to suffer a heart attack. AbbVie has asked Kennelly to throw out that verdict over inconsistencies during the trial. Other pharmaceutical companies are facing similar lawsuits over their testosterone replacement therapies. But Eli Lilly and Co, Endo International and GlaxoSmithKline have told Kennelly in recent months that they have tentatively agreed to settle hundreds of lawsuits against them. The terms of those settlements were not disclosed. More than 4,000 cases are still pending against AbbVie.

562,ABBV,"AbbVie, Samsung Bioepis in deal; Humira biosimilar U.S. release in 2023","(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc on Thursday said it signed a deal with Samsung Bioepis and its joint venture partner Biogen Inc that would fend off U.S. competition of their biosimilar version to blockbuster drug Humira until 2023. This is the second deal AbbVie has signed over the past year as it tries to safeguard patents on Humira, which is the world’s top-selling prescription medicine. The drug, which treats rheumatoid arthritis, raked in $18.43 billion in sales last year and accounted for nearly two-thirds of AbbVie’s net revenue. While terms of the deal were undisclosed, AbbVie said it will make no payments to Samsung Bioepis and the three companies agreed to dismiss all pending lawsuits. Even if multiple Humira biosimilars are delayed from market until 2023, this can be “more than offset” by a steeper sales decline for Humira, BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said. Arfaei noted this is increasingly likely given the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s encouraging stance on the approval of biosimilar drugs and fewer chances of drugmakers negotiating with insurers to gain preferred coverage of their drugs over rivals. Samsung Bioepis’ license to market its biosimilar will kick off on June 30, 2023, after which Samsung will pay royalties to license Humira patents, AbbVie said in a statement. Samsung Bioepis is partnered with Biogen to market the drug in Europe and Merck & Co to market it in the United States.  Biogen expects to launch the biosimilar, Imraldi, in Europe in mid-October this year.     In September, Amgen Inc reached a similar settlement with AbbVie to delay the U.S. launch of its cheaper biosimilar to Humira until Jan. 31, 2023. Jefferies analyst Ian Hilliker notes the deal with Samsung Bioepis enables a biosimilar launch some months after Amgen, making it increasingly unlikely other rivals will be able to negotiate settlements that allow their launches before 2023. Shares of AbbVie, which has been focusing on developing cancer drugs to sustain long-term growth, have been under pressure in recent months hurt by a failed trial of an experimental lung cancer treatment, Rova-T.

Arfaei noted this is increasingly likely given the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s encouraging stance on the approval of biosimilar drugs and fewer chances of drugmakers negotiating with insurers to gain preferred coverage of their drugs over rivals. Samsung Bioepis’ license to market its biosimilar will kick off on June 30, 2023, after which Samsung will pay royalties to license Humira patents, AbbVie said in a statement. Samsung Bioepis is partnered with Biogen to market the drug in Europe and Merck & Co to market it in the United States.  Biogen expects to launch the biosimilar, Imraldi, in Europe in mid-October this year.     In September, Amgen Inc reached a similar settlement with AbbVie to delay the U.S. launch of its cheaper biosimilar to Humira until Jan. 31, 2023. Jefferies analyst Ian Hilliker notes the deal with Samsung Bioepis enables a biosimilar launch some months after Amgen, making it increasingly unlikely other rivals will be able to negotiate settlements that allow their launches before 2023.

573,ABBV,UPDATE 4-Shire sells cancer drugs to Servier for $2.4 bln as Takeda circles,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shire, the London-listed rare diseases specialist that is a potential takeover target for Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical, is selling its oncology business to unlisted French drugmaker Servier for $2.4 billion. The deal suggests there is value locked up within Shire’s portfolio - despite a dismal share price performance in the past two years - as its management braces for a possible $50-billion bid battle with Japan’s biggest drugmaker. Shire said on Monday it would consider returning proceeds from the sale to shareholders through a buyback and that further selective disposals of non-strategic assets were possible. The divestment of the cancer business may be a deterrent for Takeda, since oncology was one of the areas it had highlighted as driving the case for a Shire deal, along with gastrointestinal medicine and neuroscience. Still, given the small contribution of the cancer business to Shire’s overall profits, Deutsche Bank analysts said this was unlikely to be a deal breaker. A Takeda spokesman declined to comment.  Shire was at pains to point out that it started exploring the sale of oncology in December and commenced the disposal process in January, during which it identified multiple possible U.S., European and Japanese buyers. Takeda’s interest in Shire was made public only at the end of last month. Under UK takeover regulations, Takeda has until April 25 to announce whether or not it will bid for Shire, which has a market value of around $47 billion.  Britain has strict rules about the conduct of bids, including defensive actions taken by target companies. A spokesman said Shire had consulted the UK Takeover Panel on the Servier deal and been told it did not constitute a “frustrating action” under the Takeover Code. Buying Shire would be transformational for Takeda but would be a huge financial stretch, since the company is worth around $10 billion more than the Japanese group. Shire also had debt of around $19 billion as of the end of 2017. The drugs industry has seen a surge in deal-making this year as large players look for promising assets to improve their pipelines, but a Takeda-Shire transaction would be by far the biggest yet.  Two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said last week that Takeda had sounded out its major creditors for loans to fund a potential Shire bid. Shire Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov said the sale of the oncology business to Servier demonstrated the value embedded in Shire as shares in the company rose 0.8 percent by 1230 GMT. Jefferies analysts said the sale “should boost Shire’s negotiating position on asking price in the current offer period with Takeda”. Shire has long been seen as a likely takeover target and was nearly bought by U.S. drugmaker AbbVie in 2014, until U.S. tax rule changes caused it to walk away.  Shire itself also has a track record of acquisitions, but its biggest ever deal - the $32 billion purchase of Baxalta in 2016 - was widely criticized by shareholders. Its oncology business had sales of $262 million last year, putting the divestment on a respectable revenue multiple of 9.2 times.  For privately held Servier, acquiring Shire’s oncology operation allows it to establish a direct commercial presence in the United States and boosts its presence in cancer. Drugs being acquired include the two already marketed products Oncaspar for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and rights outside the United States to Onivyde for pancreatic cancer. Servier also gets the experimental drug calaspargase pegol for leukemia and an early-stage immuno-oncology pipeline.

574,ABBV,FOCUS-Germany's Merck seeks partners for cancer and immune system drugs,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Merck KGaA will seek development partners for experimental treatments including tepotinib as the German company looks to licensing deals to help fund clinical trials, according to its head of drug R&D.; Merck has a promising drug pipeline for the first time in several years. It is looking to take a collaborative approach, as an expected decline in operating profit this year forces it to find new ways to finance pharmaceutical development. Luciano Rossetti, its drug research and development chief, told Reuters the company was engaged in “very intense ongoing conversations” over deals to help fund trials of drugs in its pipeline. He said Merck was looking to strike agreements for treatments including oral lung cancer drug tepotinib as well as a so-called bifunctional fusion protein at an earlier stage of development, which aims to assist the immune system in fighting cancer cells.  Merck did not disclose the names of potential partners. Rossetti said the company was preparing to present initial Phase 2 trial data for tepotinib at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago in June which he expected would show the drug blocks a genetic mutation that drives tumor growth in certain lung cancer cases.  “What we expect from this high-precision approach is to have a high response rate in this patient population,” said Rossetti, adding that ASCO had the final word over whether the findings could be presented at the conference.  Bernstein analysts said in a March 21 note that tepotinib was the “one to watch” among Merck’s early and mid-stage pipeline drugs, and predicted 2030 sales of 530 million euros ($650 million). Licence partnership agreements, which typically see a drugmaker share the cost of trials with another pharma or biotech firm in return for a share of future sales, offer Merck a way to drive through a promising drug pipeline in as many disease types as possible. However such deals are double-edged; while they curb risk, they also curb earnings.  Merck, a diversified company that also has chemicals and lab equipment divisions, does not have the financial firepower in pharmaceuticals of the sector’s biggest players, including Roche, Pfizer, Novartis and Sanofi. This could prevent it challenging larger rivals in acquiring assets in a consolidating global market, analysts say.  Pharma majors often buy certain rights to experimental drugs from rivals or smaller biotech firms to bolster their pipeline. Selling rights, so-called outlicensing, is also common but is mainly driven by a desire to win partners in unfamiliar markets rather than financial constraints. Merck’s bifunctional fusion protein, which combines its approved cancer drug Bavencio’s immunotherapy mechanism with a second immune trigger, is in Phase 1 trials. Drugs typically go through three phases of testing before a market launch, but in cancer can be cut short to two when regulators see sufficient promise.  Merck, which started out 350 years ago as an apothecary shop in the German city of Darmstadt, sells products ranging from pearlescent pigments to dimmable window panes.  Healthcare - pharmaceuticals, allergy treatments and consumer health - accounted for 46 percent of its 15.3 billion euros of sales last year. Merck struck a deal this week to sell the consumer health unit to Procter & Gamble Co for 3.4 billion euros, but the company said this would not affect its plans to seek partners to help develop its pharma pipeline. The group is in a bind; just as it turned around its drug pipeline with promising candidates against arthritis and cancer, its finances have been squeezed by Chinese competition for its biggest cash generator - liquid crystals for TV screens.  This means it is lacking the money to take the drug candidates forward under its own steam. Its shares have fallen 21 percent over the past year, compared with an 8 percent decline in the European pharma index and a 3 percent gain in the European chemicals index. “Considering that Merck had next to no pipeline five years ago, they’ve built up something quite solid,” said Markus Manns, portfolio manager at Union Investment, which holds shares in the German company. “As an investor I wouldn’t want to take an earnings hit if Merck were to decide to go it alone in pharmaceuticals development.” He added many pharma and biotech players were eager to grab a slice of other companies’ promising new treatments, putting Merck in a “very comfortable position”.  Merck, when it flagged its collaborative approach to drug development last month, had highlighted evobrutinib, a so-called BTK inhibitor designed to block white blood cells from launching an immune response at healthy cells. It is in the second phase of testing. The drug’s potentially broad use in the fast-growing autoimmune market, including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and lupus, would attract prospective partners such as Abbvie and Roche, said Manns. Bernstein has identified Merck’s stock as a bargain due to low market expectations. “Merck KGaA’s pipeline is often overlooked by investors, rightly so given the lack of visibility and poor track record,” said analyst Wimal Kapadia. “Given most investors expect failure, the risk/reward is to the upside.” ($1 = 0.8112 euros) ",4202018,http://www.reuters.com/article/merck-pipeline/focus-germanys-merck-seeks-partners-for-cancer-and-immune-system-drugs-idUSL8N1RU5H3

576,ABBV,"AbbVie's beat fueled by demand for Humira, Hep C drugs","(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, on higher sales of its rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira and its Hepatitis C drugs, leading the company to raise its full-year earnings forecast. The company’s shares, which have been under pressure due to setbacks to its drug pipeline, gained about 3.6 percent to $95.22 in late morning trading. Sales from the company’s Hepatitis C franchise soared to $919 million, easily beating consensus estimate of $572 million, according to brokerage Bernstein. The revenue rise was fueled by sales of newly approved Mavyret, and comes when the market for Hepatitis C treatments in the United States is steadily shrinking as the impact of the disease lessens. AbbVie said it now expects $3.5 billion in sales from Hepatitis C drugs this year.  The company’s growth in Hepatitis C comes in contrast to Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, which also released earnings on Thursday. Bristol’s hepatitis C franchise all but disappeared with sales of just $3 million.  “We have an asset that will allow us to be able to stay highly competitive and in a leadership position going forward,” AbbVie CEO Rick Gonzalez said about Mavyret on the company’s conference call, playing down concerns about the shrinking market. “We think we have the right tools to be effective over the long term.” Still, rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira - the world’s best-selling prescription medicine - brings in nearly two-thirds of AbbVie’s total revenue. Quarterly sales of the drug rose to $4.71 billion, a 20 percent increase from last year. The company has been aggressively protecting the pricey drug, negotiating with rivals Amgen Inc, Samsung Bioepis and Biogen Inc to fend off U.S. competition from their biosimilars. AbbVie said it doesn’t expect direct biosimilar competition to Humira in the United States until at least 2022. Cancer treatment Imbruvica raked in $762 million in sales, just above expectations. The drugmaker raised 2018 adjusted earnings per share expectation to between $7.66 and $7.76, from between $7.33 and $7.43 previously forecast. AbbVie said the forecast accounts for an effective tax rate approaching 9 percent this year, following the new U.S. tax law. On its conference call, AbbVie said that it was going to be investing more aggressively in research and development (R&D;) as a result of the tax reform.  But its forecast for 2018 R&D; spending as a percentage of its sales is actually down from last year. The company said it expects to spend just over 16 percent of its sales on R&D; this year, down from 17.1 percent in 2017.   Net earnings rose to $2.78 billion, or $1.74 per share, in the quarter, from $1.71 billion, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, AbbVie earned $1.87 per share, ahead of analysts’ estimate of $1.79. AbbVie’s net revenue rose 21.4 percent to $7.93 billion, ahead of average estimate of $7.59 billion. The company also said it would roll out part of a previously announced share repurchase program by May 1, and buy back up to $7.5 billion of stock.

582,ABBV,REFILE-Goldman's Waldron says U.S. tax reform boosts shareholder activism,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. companies with more cash on their balance sheets thanks to tax reform are coming under greater scrutiny from activist investors, a top Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) investment banker said this week. Some 73 campaigns by U.S. and European activist shareholders were launched in the first quarter of 2018 against the boards of companies with market capitalization exceeding $500 million, the highest quarter on record, according to data from Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N).  John Waldron, the co-head of Goldman Sachs investment bank division, said at the annual Milken Institute Global Conference that U.S. tax reform was a driver behind the rise in such campaigns.  “There’s excess cash for most companies laying on the balance sheet and shareholders are going to press for answers of what they are going to do with it,” Waldron told the Milken Conference in Los Angeles. Sweeping tax reform was U.S. President Donald Trump’s first major legislative triumph since he took office in January 2017. Among the changes were a lowering of the headline corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and the introduction of a one-time mandatory cash repatriation tax. Waldron, whose bank advises companies on how to defend themselves against activist investors, said that a big question on his clients’ minds is whether shareholders are going to give companies the time they need to decide how to deploy cash. “Is pressure going to mount to come out with a capital allocation plan that’s fairly defined? How much is going into the business, how much is going to return capital to shareholders and how much will go to M&A;?,” Waldron said. Share buybacks have been a popular tool among companies to return money to impatient investors. For example, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) earlier this week promised shareholders $100 billion in additional stock buybacks, the starkest example yet of how companies are using the mountain of overseas cash suddenly freed up by the tax overhaul. Other companies announcing plans to return cash to shareholders recently include Facebook Inc (FB.O), AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) and Broadcom Inc (AVGO.O). Activist shareholders are paying attention. TCI Fund Asset Management said in March that Altaba Inc (AABA.O), a company with a market capitalization of $57 billion that used to be a part of Yahoo Inc and holds large stakes in Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA.N) and Yahoo Japan Corp (4689.T), should take advantage of U.S. tax cuts and liquidate its assets. “We’re seeing more (activist shareholder) campaigns this year than in the past three years,” Waldron said. The proliferation of activist campaigns is like “throwing gasoline on the fire,” boosting mergers and acquisitions, Waldron added.
