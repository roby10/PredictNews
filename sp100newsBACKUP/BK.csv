1,BK,New York probes Bank of America $8.5 billion mortgage pact,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York’s attorney general is investigating Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) $8.5 billion settlement with investors over losses in mortgage-backed securities, and has sought data from 20 institutional investors that agreed to the accord.  In letters to the firms, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman requested the names of various clients — including pension funds, government authorities and charities affiliated with the state — that invested in securities issued by the 530 mortgage securitization trusts covered in the accord. He also sought the par and current market values of the clients’ securities.  The letters are dated July 7, and were sent in connection with the attorney general’s “ongoing investigation” into the securitization of residential mortgages. Schneiderman requested that the information be provided by July 14.  Among the investors were BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), MetLife Inc (MET.N) and Allianz SE’s (ALVG.DE) Pacific Investment Management Co. Of the 22 investors that agreed to the accord, only the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Banks were not sent letters by Schneiderman.  Schneiderman’s office and representatives of Bank of America and BlackRock declined to comment. A MetLife spokesman said that insurer has not seen a letter from Schneiderman. Pimco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Reuters obtained copies of the letters on Tuesday.  Various attorneys general are scrutinizing the causes of and fallout from excess in mortgage securitizations, a key driver of the recent housing and financial crises.  Regulators including all 50 state attorneys general are also working on an expected multi-billion dollar settlement with large mortgage servicers over foreclosure practices.  The $8.5 billion settlement announced June 29 was part of roughly $20 billion of charges that Bank of America hopes will resolve much of its legal liability from its 2008 purchase of mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp.  But the accord has drawn challenges from some Countrywide mortgage securities investors who question whether the accord is fair, or may provide some investors with windfalls.  The settlement requires approval by New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick in Manhattan.  In court filings this week, the institutional investors rejected various criticisms by a group of pension funds and 11 companies sharing the name Walnut Place, which own Countrywide securities in some trusts covered by the accord.  The institutional investors called “ludicrous” a claim that they engineered a gentle settlement to help Bank of America, which many of them regularly do business with in other areas.  They also said that to exclude some trusts from the accord would deprive investors in those trusts of other benefits, including servicing improvements that could lead to fewer foreclosures and higher values for their mortgage securities.  On Monday, Congressman Brad Miller, a Democrat and member of the House Financial Services Committee, questioned whether taxpayers might end up on the hook for excessive losses through the ownership by government-run Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB of securities covered in the settlement.

3,BK,Six FHLB banks challenge BofA mortgage pact,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Six of the Federal Home Loan Banks and another investor are seeking to intervene in Bank of America Corp’s $8.5 billion settlement with investors in soured mortgage-backed securities, signaling growing opposition to the accord.  FHLB branches in Boston, Chicago, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Seattle said they have gotten “very little information” to help decide whether the settlement with the largest U.S. bank is fair.  They said they paid more than $8.8 billion, a sum exceeding the entire settlement amount, for securities in 73 trusts backed by home loans from Countrywide Financial Corp, which Bank of America bought in 2008.  Meanwhile, the investor TM1 Investors LLC said it may sue to force Bank of America to buy back its securities, which it said were once worth more than $400 million.  The opposition was expressed in filings on Wednesday in the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. It means at least four investors or investor groups are preparing challenges.  Eric Schneiderman, the state attorney general, has asked most of the 22 institutional investors joining the settlement — including BlackRock Inc, MetLife Inc and Allianz SE’s Pacific Investment Management Co — for details about the accord, a sign he may challenge it as well.  The $8.5 billion settlement covers mortgages with a $174 billion unpaid principal balance, about 5 cents on the dollar.  Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson declined to comment. David Grais, a lawyer for the home loan banks and TM1, also declined to comment.  In their filings, the six home loan banks and TM1 said they are unconvinced that Bank of New York Mellon Corp, trustee for the 530 mortgage pools covered in the settlement, adequately protected their rights in negotiating the accord.  “After much investigation, TM1 believes that many of the loans that Countrywide sold to the trust in which it owns securities did not comply with the representations and warranties” Grais wrote.  “As a result,” he added, “TM1, together with one or more investors in the same trust, is considering legal action on behalf of that trust to enforce Countrywide’s obligation to repurchase those defective loans.”  The 12 federal home loan banks offer financing and grants to help members make mortgage and small business loans, and foster economic development.  One, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, is among the 22 investors that signed on to the Bank of America settlement.  “The federal home loan banks operate independently,” said Sharon Cook, a spokeswoman for the Atlanta bank. “We support the settlement, and the right of other federal home loan banks to further evaluate it.”  Other objections to the accord have come from companies known as Walnut Place LLC, which Grais’ firm represents, and from a group of public pension funds that said some investors could get a “windfall.  If the settlement wins court approval, affected investors would not be allowed to “opt out.” Walnut Place would have to drop its February lawsuit against Bank of America over its securities, once worth $1.06 billion.  New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick in Manhattan scheduled a November 17 hearing on the settlement.

6,BK,UPDATE 1-Schwab to offer trading in 12 foreign markets," * Clients demand access to non-U.S. stocks, currencies  (Adds list of countries, background, byline)   By Joseph A. Giannone   NEW YORK, July 13 (Reuters) - Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N) said it will let customers trade stocks and currencies in 12 foreign markets starting next year to capture investors’ growing appetites for broadening their exposure beyond the United States.   The largest online brokerage said Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR.N), a securities processing and outsourcing company, will help Schwab customers trade in multiple markets and seven non-U.S. currencies starting in the 2012 first quarter.   Trading initially will be offered in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and the UK. New currencies include the Australian, Canadian and Hong Long dollars, plus pounds sterling, Japanese yen, euros and Norway’s kroner.   Fidelity Investments almost two years ago began offering stock trading to retail investors in 16 currencies and 25 countries, and Bank of New York Mellon’s (BK.N) Pershing and other clearing firms also provide a forex capability to many broker-dealers.   Schwab has been expanding investing services as a growing number of customers seek higher-growth markets as well as a hedge against U.S. dollar weakness.   Last autumn, Schwab introduced trading in over-the-counter equities outside the United States, spurring a 300 percent jump in the first quarter in foreign stock trading from compared with a year earlier.   To accompany the new trading capabilities, Schwab said it will introduce global macro-economic research and currency commentary from in-house and third-party experts, as well as 24-hour customer service.

9,BK,WRAPUP 3-Trust banks earnings up amid new business,"   * State Street Corp, BNY Mellon report higher earnings   * Sharp rise in assets under custody reflects new business   * Both banks vow to tackle rising expenses   * State Street shares down 4 pct  (Recasts first sentence, adds comments from CEO, details on layoffs, updates share movement)   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Ross Kerber   BOSTON, July 19 (Reuters) - State Street Corp (STT.N) and Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N), two of the world’s biggest custody banks, boasted double-digit gains in assets during the second quarter, helping to offset higher expenses and stubbornly low interest rates that have weighed on profits.   The companies, which keep records and oversee assets for pension funds like Calpers and some of the world’s biggest hedge funds, said new business wins fueled the gains and forecast strong demand in the months ahead.   At the same time, however, the companies saw expenses climb during the quarter, which worried some investors. Shares of State Street were down 4 percent on Tuesday afternoon, while Bank of New York Mellon shares were up 0.2 percent.   State Street CEO Joseph Hooley acknowledged in an interview that higher quarterly expenses — largely due to merit raises that are paid in April — caught shareholders’ attention. Expenses rose 20 percent on an operating basis, fueled by a 22 percent increase in salaries and employee benefits.   “Most of the concern on (State Street’s) quarterly numbers has to do with expenses,” RBC analyst Gerard Cassidy said, referring to State Street’s drop in share price even though earnings met expectations of Wall Street analysts.   State Street also surprised some investors and analysts with new details on a jobs reduction plan that will translate to a charge of up to $130 million later this year before it will save the company about $200 million a year from next year.   The Boston-based company will eliminate 850 positions in its information technology group, marking the second time in less than a year that it has announced cuts. In November it said it was laying off 1,400 people.   Cost cuts also featured prominently at Bank of New York Mellon where CEO Executive Robert Kelly said the bank will continue moving jobs from New York and Boston to lower-cost areas and will detail more cost-cutting measures at an investor conference in the autumn.   Bank of New York Mellon’s net income climbed 12 percent to $735 million, or 59 cents a share, beating Wall Street’s estimates. State Street’s earnings rose 19 percent to $513 million.   On an operating basis, State Street’s profit climbed to $483 million, or 96 cents a share, marking a 5 percent gain.   Each company earned more in investment management fees for overseeing trillions of dollars in assets for pension funds and other large clients. Bank of New York Mellon saw a 14 percent gain in investment management fees while State Street reported a 24 percent gain.   Some of the fee increases were fueled by acquisitions.   Bank of New York Mellon last year signed a deal to buy PNC Financial Services Group Inc’s global-investment services business, while State Street acquired the Bank of Ireland’s asset management business in January.   State Street reported a 15 percent gain in assets under management to $2.1 trillion. Bank of New York reported a 22 percent gain to $1.3 trillion.   Assets under custody climbed 19.6 percent to $22.8 trillion at State Street and rose 21 percent to $26.3 trillion at Bank of New York Mellon.   Nomura analyst Glenn Schorr praised Bank of New York Mellon’s strong new business trends and “very significant deposit growth.”   But the companies still face pressure from low interest rates, which have forced them to waive money market fees, and lower trading volatility, which cut foreign exchange revenue.   State Street’s foreign exchange trading revenue dropped 9 percent while it fell 25 percent at Bank of New York Mellon.   Pension funds have accused both companies of cheating customers on currency trading by failing to execute trades at the lowest rates.   Each bank has denied wrongdoing in the past and neither gave new details about the cases as interest in the matter appeared to have quieted in the last weeks. Indeed State Street recently signed a new custody deal with pension fund Calpers, signaling that the fallout might be limited.

Both banks faced questions around rising expenses, however, and State Street’s shares were down 5 percent in morning trading at $40.74 after it said it plans to eliminate 530 technology jobs in coming years and outsource others — its second major round of layoffs since November.  “Most of the concern on (State Street’s) quarterly numbers has to do with expenses,” said RBC analyst Gerard Cassidy.

The New York bank on Tuesday also outlined cost-cutting efforts and noted higher legal expenses as it faces challenges to its foreign-exchange operations.   Both areas are manageable as revenue increased 15 percent to $3.85 billion from a year earlier, Chief Executive Officer Robert Kelly said in a telephone interview on Tuesday.   Quarter-to-quarter revenue growth is accelerating, helped by acquisitions like the $2.3 billion purchase of PNC Financial Services Group’s (PNC.N) investment-servicing business last year.   “It feels like we have good momentum here,” Kelly said.   Shares of BNY Mellon were up 1.4 percent at $24.99 in morning trading.   In a research note, Nomura analyst Glenn Schorr said the results were “decent” given the soft macroeconomic environment facing BNY Mellon and other banks. He left his “neutral” rating on the shares.   BNY Mellon reported net income of $735 million, or 59 cents a share, up from $658 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier.   Analysts on average expected 55 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Assets under management rose to $1.27 trillion as of June 30 from $1.05 trillion a year earlier. Assets under custody and administration rose to $26.3 trillion from $21.8 trillion.   Total noninterest expenses rose 21 percent to $2.7 billion on acquisition costs and higher legal and litigation expenses. The company faces growing legal claims that it overcharged pension fund clients for foreign exchange services.   Kelly and other executives did not give many details on the forex matter during the interview or on a conference call with investors Tuesday morning, except to say that the business accounted for a small portion of total revenue.   The bank will hold an investor conference in the fall to outline further expense reductions, Kelly said. Efforts will include moving employees to lower-cost locations, reducing the number of buildings the company occupies, and reviewing its technology spending, as the bank has mentioned in the past.   BNY Mellon had 48,900 employees as of June 30, up from 42,700 a year earlier.   Employees are concentrated in around Pittsburgh, New York and Boston. The company has been increasing its workforce in lower-cost locations, including Pittsburgh; Manchester, United Kingdom; and India.   Trust banks have avoided many of the credit issues weighing on larger traditional banks. But shares of Bank of New York Mellon and main rival State Street Corp (STT.N) have fallen this year as they face low interest rates and limited opportunities to trim expenses.

13,BK,"UPDATE 2-Northern Trust earnings fall, miss estimates"," * EPS 62 cents vs Street view 69 cents   * Assets under custody, management climb   * Shares up 2.2 pct  (Adds details on earnings, share move)   NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - Northern Trust Corp’s (NTRS.O) second-quarter earnings fell 24 percent as stubbornly low interest rates weighed on results at the third-largest U.S. custody bank.   Net income dropped to $152.0 million, or 62 cents a share, from $199.6 million, or 82 cents, a year earlier, missing the Wall Street estimate of 69 cents a share.   But Nomura analyst Glenn Schorr wrote that earnings showed an “OK quarter considering the environment as revenues and assets rose.”   Demand for the bank’s products helped boost assets under custody by 24 percent to $4.4 trillion, while assets under management climbed 13 percent to $684.1 billion.   Northern Trust shares were up 2.2 percent to $44.60 in morning trade on Wednesday.   The bank, which offers record-keeping and asset management services to institutional investors such as pension funds, said restructuring, acquisition and integration charges totaled $22.6 million, cutting its earnings per share by 8 cents.   Noninterest income fell 4 percent to $698.7 million, primarily due to reduced levels of foreign exchange trading income.   Like other trust banks, Chicago-based Northern Trust has been forced to waive money market fees due to low interest rates.   Bigger rivals State Street Corp (STT.N) and Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N) posted higher earnings on Tuesday. [ID:nN1E76I046] Both have grown in the past year, in part through acquisitions, an area where Northern Trust has lagged behind.   Northern Trust has often been named as potential takeover target itself, although the company has steadfastly rejected such talk.   The company has vowed to cut costs, saying “we are actively pursuing a wide array of productivity and expense management initiatives.”   State Street announced plans to cut another 850 jobs, while Bank of New York Mellon said its would offer more specifics on cost-cutting later this year.

16,BK,Countrywide investors may be owed $27.5 bln-filing," * Six FHLB banks have said settlement may be unfair   * $8.5 billion settlement to resolve Countrywide claims   By Jonathan Stempel   NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) may have to pay $27.5 billion to reach a fair settlement with investors in soured Countrywide mortgage-backed securities, more than three times the $8.5 billion it agreed to pay, a group of Federal Home Loan Banks said.   In a Thursday filing in a New York state court, the banks said expert reports used as support for the settlement by Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), the trustee for the 530 covered mortgage pools, “raise more questions than they answer” and may be based on false assumptions.   FHLB branches in Boston, Chicago, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Seattle paid more than $8.8 billion for securities in 73 trusts backed by home loans from Countrywide Financial Corp, which Bank of America bought in 2008.   They and several other investor groups are seeking more details about whether the $8.5 billion accord announced last month is fair before deciding whether to challenge it.   The accord covers mortgages with a $174 billion unpaid principal balance, and is intended to resolve much of Bank of America’s remaining legal liability tied to Countrywide.   Eric Schneiderman, the New York state attorney general, has asked most of the 22 institutional investors that joined the accord for more details, a sign he may challenge it as well.   Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson said the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank believes the trustee acted appropriately in entering the settlement, and conducted “extensive due diligence” prior to doing so. Bank of New York Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine declined to comment.   In their filing, the home loan banks said the expert reports have “little value” because they appear to have been written in hindsight after the settlement was reached.   They questioned in particular one report by Brian Lin, a managing director at mortgage strategist RRMS Advisors, that called a $8.8 billion to $11 billion payout “reasonable.”   According to the banks, Lin, in examining the trusts, may have understated the number of expected defaults, the ability to recover loan principal via foreclosures, and the number of loans that Bank of America should repurchase.   If the bank were forced to buy back all loans that were in default and which breached Countrywide’s representations and warranties, rather than the 40 percent Lin estimated, “then Mr. Lin’s estimate of a reasonable settlement would rise from a range of $8.8 to $11 billion to a range of $22 billion to $27.5 billion,” the filing said. “Modifying any of his other three assumptions would cause that range to rise much more.”   Lin did not immediately return a call seeking comment.   The 12 federal home loan banks offer financing and grants to help members make mortgage and small business loans, and foster economic development. The Atlanta home loan bank is among the 22 investors that signed on to the accord.   New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick in Manhattan scheduled a Nov. 17 hearing on the settlement.   The case is In re: The Bank of New York Mellon, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 651786/2011.

17,BK,BNY Mellon names Cole-Fontayn EMEA chairman," LONDON, July 21 (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp  named Michael Cole-Fontayn as the new chairman of its Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, putting a company veteran at the head of what it regards as its main growth area.	   Cole-Fontayn, who joined BNY — one of the world’s largest custody banks — in 1984, will continue to head the depositary receipts business, BNY said.	   The EMEA region is the largest outside the United States, representing 26 percent of revenues. It was previously headed by Tim Keaney, who is returning to New York, where he will remain at the helm of the asset servicing business.	   BNY has $1.3 trillion in assets under management, but is predominantly known as a custodian bank, administering financial assets for institutional investors. It has $26.3 trillion assets under custody.	   It recently acquired BHF Asset Servicing of Germany and Insight Investment Management in the UK, giving it better access to local business in those markets. It is also eyeing growth in France and Italy.	   The asset servicing business was traditionally seen as a low-margin and unspectacular corner of banking, but the credit crisis has shown it is a reliable business, allowing BNY to withstand the turmoil relatively unharmed.	   Depositary receipts are tradable instruments that give overseas investors exposure to companies without having to buy stocks on a foreign exchange.

21,BK,Analysis: BofA mortgage pact draws glare from NY,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Four weeks ago, Bank of America Corp reached an $8.5 billion settlement it hailed as a step forward in putting mortgage liabilities behind it. But New York’s attorney general is sending strong signals he could try to reshape the deal or even scuttle it.  The settlement, which requires court approval, could provide a template for other banks hoping to settle investor claims on residential mortgage-backed securities that went bust in the financial crisis. Bank of America agreed to resolve nearly all repurchase claims tied to mortgage bonds backed by loans from its Countrywide Financial unit.  Almost as soon as the ink was dry on the pact, though, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman began to look into the deal. The investigation is part of his office’s broader examination of banks’ roles in the mortgage crisis.  The agreement was struck by trustees on 530 mortgage bonds with $174 billion in unpaid principal. It is backed by 22 big investors, including Pacific Investment Management Co and BlackRock Inc, which argued the bonds were stuffed with risky home loans that should not have been sold.  Some investors complain the pact is rife with conflicts and is a bad deal for them — although a plum one for the bank. At least four investor groups have filed court papers saying they might object to the deal.  If Schneiderman also challenges the settlement, it could have to be renegotiated — likely at a greater cost to Bank of America, analysts say. According to a court filing on Tuesday by a group of investors who oppose the deal, Schneiderman is close to deciding whether to intervene.  “The Attorney General’s office has asked us to inform the court that it is completing its analysis,” wrote David Grais, an attorney for an investor group known as Walnut Place LLC.  Danny Kanner, a spokesman for Schneiderman, declined to comment.  Critics of the settlement say Bank of New York Mellon Corp, which served as trustee for the mortgage pools covered by the settlement, secretly negotiated a deal on behalf of investors without their input. They argue BNY Mellon had a conflict of interest because it was indemnified by a Countrywide unit for costs and liabilities arising from its duties as trustee.  In his first seven months on the job, Schneiderman has embraced the title “Sheriff of Wall Street” that comes with the attorney general post, a position previously held by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Eliot Spitzer before him.  He has emerged as a key player in the negotiations between banks and state and federal regulators over alleged shoddy foreclosure practices. Schneiderman has insisted any settlement over those practices not give banks broad releases from being sued over other mortgage issues.  Under the state’s Martin Act, an expansive anti-fraud statute, Schneiderman has broad subpoena power. He could use the law to gather information to evaluate the fairness of the Bank of America deal, said Isaac Gradman, an attorney who advises investors in mortgage securities.  “He certainly has a lot of power and ability to bring to the surface unappealing information about the banks,” Gradman said. “That alone could give him leverage to have a seat at the table.”  Still, it is unclear if Schneiderman has the power to intervene. He needs permission from a court to officially insert himself into a case. If Schneiderman does not intervene on behalf of certificate holders in the soured securities, he might argue the deal does not benefit investors at large and he should be considered an interested party as their advocate.  “There are some aspects to this deal, which the attorney general may or may not consider to be in the public interest,” said Beth Kaswan, an attorney for pension fund investors seeking to intervene in the case.  In a letter to the judge on July 13, Schneiderman’s office hinted at its strategy. The office opposed an order sought by BNY Mellon that would limit intervenors to certificate holders and other interested parties, wrote special deputy attorney general Maria Filipakis.  “Such an order could have a substantial adverse impact on the interests of the State of New York,” Filipakis wrote.  BNY Mellon responded in a subsequent court filing that its proposed order is not intended to limit any interested party from seeking to intervene.  Bank of America and BNY Mellon declined to comment about the possibility of Schneiderman’s involvement in the case. Kathy Patrick, an attorney who helped negotiate the deal for investors, did not return a call seeking comment.  The settlement requires the approval of New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick, who set an August 30 deadline for objections to it.  Schneiderman has sent letters asking institutional investors who agreed to the accord for the names of their clients that have ties to New York such as pension funds and charities. The letters, obtained by Reuters, have fueled speculation Schneiderman might intervene and object to the settlement.  By asking for information, Schneiderman might be trying “to nudge some activity,” said Thomas Adams, an attorney at Paykin Krieg & Adams, who specializes in securitization issues.  The price tag ultimately could rise for Bank of America if Schneiderman exerts influence, said Chris Gamaitoni, a mortgage finance analyst with Compass Point Research & Trading.  “If they are able to subpoena information and conduct a deep analysis, that would be a negative point for the bank,” he said.

26,BK,"UPDATE 1-Moody's sets negative outlook on BNY, JPMorgan"," * Rating agency affirms ratings at both banks   * Outlook negative on dimmer chances for federal support  (Adds details on ratings, other banks)   BOSTON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Moody’s Investors Service said it may cut its ratings on Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) over the next 18 months, saying the banks might get less U.S. government support in the future.   A rating change could mean higher borrowing costs for the two New York banks.   Moody’s on Wednesday affirmed Bank of New York Mellon’s senior debt rating at Aa2, the third-highest rating, and JPMorgan at Aa3, the fourth highest. But the agency gave both banks’ ratings a negative outlook, meaning the ratings could be cut over the next 12 to 18 months.   The ratings reflect the close ties between the banks and the federal government. JPMorgan and Bank of New York Mellon were among the first financial companies to receive funds under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in the fall of 2008.   Moody’s said it confirmed the ratings on the banks because of its decision to maintain its rating on the U.S. government at Aaa. In a crisis, “there is a very high probability that these institutions would be supported by the U.S. government to avoid a default,” Moody’s wrote.   Moody’s wrote it was cutting the outlook to negative partly to match the negative outlook on U.S. debt, and because of its view that “over time the likelihood that systemically important banks will be supported by the U.S. government ... could decline” because of rule changes like the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul.   Six other banks whose fortunes could depend on government support already had either negative outlooks, including Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) and State Street Corp (STT.N), or were on review for downgrade. Those included including Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N), said Moody’s credit analyst David Fanger via e-mail.  (Reporting by Ross Kerber.

Amid a crisis, “there is a very high probability that these institutions would be supported by the U.S. government to avoid a default,” Moody’s wrote.   However, Moody’s wrote it was cutting the outlook to negative partly to match the negative outlook on U.S. debt, and because of its view that “over time the likelihood that systemically important banks will be supported by the U.S. government ... could decline” because of rule changes like the Dodd-Frank financial reform act.

28,BK,UPDATE 1-BofA says legal losses could hit $2.3 bln," * Litigation loss estimate up $700 million   * Up from Q1 loss estimate of $1.6 bln   By Joe Rauch   CHARLOTTE, N.C., Aug 4 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) legal losses could cost as much as $2.3 billion above money already set aside to cover litigation, the largest U.S. bank by assets said in securities filing.   BofA raised the possible legal loss estimate by $700 million in its second quarter report, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday.   In the first quarter, BofA said litigation losses could cost up to $1.6 billion above existing reserves.   The increase signals BofA’s long-running litigation woes may not be behind it.   The bank is the subject of on-going investigations by state and federal authorities relating to home foreclosures, and demands from outside investors that the bank repurchase billions in toxic home loans now part of those soured securities.   And recent settlements are not reducing the bank’s projections for worst-case legal losses.   During the second quarter, the bank entered into an $8.5 billion settlement with a group of large mortgage-backed securities investors who hold Countrywide Financial Corp mortgage bonds and Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N), who is the trustee for the securities.   BofA bought Countrywide in July 2008.   That pact is awaiting court approval, and several investors have already publicly said they will work to block the deal.   BofA shares closed down 7.4 percent at $8.83 on the New York Stock Exchange in a broad industry sell-off.

29,BK,BNY Mellon imposes fee on rapidly growing deposits,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp told some of its biggest depositors this week it does not want their money.  BNY Mellon said it is charging a fee to big corporate and asset management clients that deposit more money than average, because it has been overwhelmed by deposits.  Global economic turmoil — including the Greek debt crisis and the U.S. debt ceiling debate — has driven BNY Mellon’s large clients to sell riskier assets and move the proceeds to deposit accounts.  The flood of cash is likely to raise BNY Mellon’s U.S. deposit insurance fees and could weaken capital ratios, which are partly based on liabilities such as deposits.  BNY Mellon said in a letter to clients that the big increase in deposits is likely “transient,” meaning the funds cannot be invested.  “Past history shows that once the storm passes, these deposits quickly return to the markets,” its letter said.  The fee is nominal — just 0.13 percentage points a year, or less than $200 a day on an excess balance of $50 million— and it applies only to clients with average deposits of more than $50 million who exceed their average levels in June. High-net worth clients are not subject to the fee.  The decision to impose a charge, however, reflects how pressed banks feel to control costs as interest rates wallow near zero in an economy that shows little signs of recovery.  The decision to charge for deposits contributed to soaring demand on Thursday for U.S. Treasury bills, traders said, as bank depositors redeployed cash into government securities. One-month T-bill rates dipped below zero.  The bank encouraged clients “to consider a variety of cash investment options to minimize any effect” of the new charge.  BNY Mellon, like other trust and custody banks, manages cash for companies and handles back-office processing of securities and banking transaction for fund managers, among its other businesses. The bank does not have retail branches.  The company’s move to impose deposit fees was not matched by rivals State Street Corp, or Northern Trust Corp.  BNY Mellon’s deposits are rising in part because companies have been maintaining higher cash balances during the recent financial and economic turmoil. Similarly, investment managers have been selling risky assets and plowing proceeds into bank accounts to ensure they can meet investor demands for redemption.  Marty Mosby, a banking analyst at Guggenheim Partners, said BNY Mellon has more corporate clients than many of its rivals and therefore attract more deposits.  The bank is imposing the new fee on customers whose monthly average balances after August 8 are more than 10 percent above their average in June and the extra fee only applies to the portion of the balance that is at least 10 percent above the average.  The fee is 0.13 percentage points annualized, which is adjusted if one-month Treasury bill rates fall below zero.  The bank said the fee is intended to apply to a small number of clients and will likely be rescinded as markets return to normal.  Higher deposits could raise U.S. deposit insurance fees assessed quarterly by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, based on banks’ daily average deposit and asset levels.

37,BK,COLUMN-NY intervention goes beyond BofA's mortgage deal: Frankel," -- Alison Frankel writes the On the Case blog for Thomson Reuters News & Insight (newsandinsight.com). The views expressed are her own. --   By Alison Frankel   NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Before Thursday night, opposition to Bank of America’s (BAC.N) proposed $8.5 billion settlement with Countrywide mortgage-backed securities investors consisted of a handful of investor groups represented by a handful of law firms. Even if you counted the six Federal Home Loan Banks that have moved to intervene but haven’t yet gone on record opposing the deal, intervenors represented less than 7 percent of all Countrywide MBS noteholders. The 22 gargantuan institutional investors that negotiated the settlement were a much more potent force.   That all changed when New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman — in a move that stunned deal proponents — filed an explosive motion to intervene in the $8.5 billion settlement [nN1E773268]. Schneiderman didn’t just register his opposition to the proposed settlement, which he said had been reached “without ever giving beneficiaries or their representatives an opportunity to test [whether] the proposed settlement is reasonable.” He went far, far beyond mere opposition: Schneiderman accused the Countrywide MBS trustee, Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N), of breaching its fiduciary duty and said that Bank of America may have aided and abetted the breach. And to show that he was serious about those assertions, Schneiderman actually filed counterclaims against BNY Mellon along with his intervention motion.   The countersuit — a truly revolutionary filing — alleges three causes of action against BNY Mellon, in what is thought to be the first time the AG has accused an MBS trustee of fraud. Schneiderman claimed the bank breached its duty to investors because the settlement includes indemnification for the trustee — a “direct financial benefit” for BNY Mellon, according to the AG’s filing. Schneiderman also asserted that BNYM let down Countrywide MBS investors long before proposing the $8.5 billion settlement, by failing to notify certificate holders that underlying Countrywide mortgages were in default. Finally, the New York AG accused Bank of New York Mellon of securities fraud under New York’s Martin Act.   Schneiderman didn’t claim that New York pension funds actually have a stake in the Countrywide MBS trusts. Instead, he claimed standing under the parens patriae doctrine, asserting that he intervened “to protect the interests of the public and absent investors.” And that raises a question that Bank of New York Mellon — once it recovers from the shock of the AG’s filing — is sure to argue to Judge Barbara Kapnick as she weighs whether to approve the proposed settlement. Are investors — and the public at large — better off if the New York AG kills the proposed BofA settlement?   There are a lot of ways to look at the question. In the narrowest interpretation, will investors be able to recover more money for breach of warranty claims against Countrywide than they would under the settlement? Maybe. There have only been a few investor put-back cases filed against Countrywide, mostly by David Grais of Grais & Ellsworth, and they’re not far enough along to lay odds on their success. Mayer Brown, which represents BNY Mellon in the BofA proposed settlement, argues that a lot of obstacles stand between Countrywide noteholders and a windfall recovery from Bank of America. Those range from the loan-by-loan evaluation investors will have to make of individual underlying mortgages to Bank of America’s claim that it’s not liable for Countrywide’s failings.   Grais may be able to surmount those obstacles, which is why his goal in opposing the proposed BofA deal seems to be to force the bank to permit opt-outs for investors who want to take their chances in litigation. If the settlement blows up, however, every Countrywide MBS investor is going to have to slug it out in court, and they’re certainly not all represented by lawyers who are prepared for a long, expensive battle with BofA that may end with them getting nothing.   The AG’s filing, moreover, has implications beyond the BofA case. Bank of America and Bank of New York Mellon certainly bear a heavy load of responsibility for the MBS fiasco. The New York AG has been engaged in an investigation of their (and other banks’) various failures as a trustee, MBS issuer, and mortgage servicer. But this settlement was at least an attempt to mitigate the damage BofA and BNY Mellon have caused investors-and for some reason, Schneiderman waited until now to claim that BNY Mellon committed fraud and that BofA may have abetted it. That timing gives little incentive to any of the other banks facing billions of dollars in MBS breach-of-warranty liability to reach global deals with investors. Why spend months negotiating a settlement if the New York AG, under the broad aegis of protecting the public, attacks you after you reach a deal?   The AG’s filing gives MBS trustees even less incentive to push for investor settlements. Trustees have been incredibly slow to take action against MBS issuers, which is why regulators like Schneiderman are scrutinizing them. Bank of New York Mellon took a bold step when it hired Jason Kravitt and Matthew Ingber of Mayer Brown to talk to the Gibbs & Bruns group of 22 investors, instead of continuing to resist investors calls for action against MBS issuers. Its reward for reaching a deal with the Gibbs & Bruns investors? A Martin Act suit. Given that Schneiderman hasn’t brought Martin Act claims against MBS trustees that haven’t proposed global settlements, why would any trustee try to engineer a deal? For the banks that issued mortgage-backed securities and the banks that acted as trustees on MBS offerings, the Schneiderman filings are a very good reason to keep their profiles low by quietly defending cases by those investors with the fortitude to sue.   Then there’s the issue of the mortgage servicing provisions in the BofA settlement proposal. BofA and the Gibbs & Bruns group have touted the servicing provisions, which call for Bank of America to outsource loan service to companies tasked with renegotiating troubled loans, rather than pushing homeowners into default. Bank of America, in fact, regarded the loan modification provisions of the MBS settlement as template for solving the foreclosure crisis.   The AG’s filing, on the other hand, blasted the settlement’s servicing provisions as “too vague and ill-defined to provide any concrete value to investors.” Schneiderman complained that Bank of America’s poor track record in modifying troubled loans underscored the inadequacy of the servicing aspects of the settlement. The AG is in the midst of talks to reach nationwide mortgage modification deals with a host of banks, so I’m sure he’s speaking knowledgeably. But as a matter of tactics, he doesn’t seem to be sending a message of cooperation to BofA — or other banks.   Finally, there’s the message the AG sent to New York businesses. BNY Mellon’s response to the AG was as remarkable, in its way, as the AG’s filing. “The allegations by the New York attorney general are outrageous, baseless, unsupported by fact and law and we will fight them if necessary in court,” the bank said in a rare display of adjectives by a financial institution. “We are confident that we have fulfilled in all respects our responsibilities as trustee. The AG’s action is misguided and fails to comprehend the role of the trustee and the benefit the settlement would provide to investors.”   A BNY Mellon spokesman told me the bank didn’t want to comment on the broader implications of the AG’s filing, but directed me to Kathryn Wylde, CEO of the Partnership for New York City, a business development non-profit. She said that the AG’s “careless action” hurts New York’s standing as a financial center.   “It’s disappointing from the standpoint of the business community that the AG would make a fraud accusation against a major financial institution — in the press,” she told me. “And to not have any consultation with the institution? The bank was blindsided by what appears to be an outrageous charge.” (The AG’s press office didn’t respond to my request of comment.)   Thursday’s filing unquestionably changes the tenor of the BofA MBS settlement. It could end up changing a lot of other things as well.

39,BK,NY seeks to intervene in BoA $8.5 billion pact,"NEW YORK/CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - New York’s attorney general will oppose Bank of America Corp’s $8.5 billion settlement over repurchasing toxic mortgage loans, joining a growing number of unhappy mortgage bond buyers now fighting the pact reached with some of the largest institutional investors in the country.  In court papers filed late Thursday, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sought to intervene in order to “protect the marketplace and the interests of New York investors, the vast majority of whom otherwise are not present before the Court in this proceeding.”  The filing comes a day before a scheduled court hearing in the case that’s expected to address when parties opposing the deal can seek discovery.  In late June, BofA settled an eight-month dispute with outside investors who bought Countrywide Financial Corp mortgage bonds.  The investors — including Pacific Investment Management Co, or PIMCO, and BlackRock Inc — requested the bank repurchase toxic home loans that comprised a series of mortgage-backed securities.  BofA, the investors and securities trustee Bank of New York Mellon agreed to an $8.5 billion settlement that applies to all investors in nearly all Countrywide Financial-created mortgage bonds, but the deal must be approved by a New York court.  The attorney general said in a filing the accord may interfere with his ability to pursue claims against the banks involved, and claims that BofA and Bank of New York may have violated their fiduciary duties in reaching the agreement.  In court documents, Schneiderman echoed complaints from other investors who have said that the deal was done in secret and was rife with conflicts. He called the proposed settlement “both procedurally and substantively flawed.”  Schneiderman argued that Bank of New York was conflicted during the negotiations with Bank of America because Countrywide agreed to indemnify it for claims arising out of its role as trustee.  “As trustee, BNYM owed and owes a fiduciary duty of undivided loyalty to trust investors, and its direct financial interest in the consummation and approval of the settlement violates that duty of strict loyalty,” said Schneiderman in court filings.  A spokesman for Bank of New York said in a statement that the allegations are “outrageous” and “baseless.”  “We are confident that we have fulfilled in all respects our responsibilities as Trustee,” he said. “The AG’s action is misguided and fails to comprehend the role of the Trustee and the benefit the settlement would provide to investors.  Bank of America declined to comment.  The objection is the latest wrinkle in BofA’s push to rid itself of mortgage issues stemming from the collapse of the U.S. housing market.  The bank inherited many of its current problems from Countrywide Financial Corp. BofA bought the largest U.S. subprime mortgage lender in July 2008, months before the global financial crisis peaked.  This year, BofA has agreed to a series of settlements to remove the specter it may have to repurchase billions in soured mortgages.  In January, the bank settled with U.S. government-backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for $2.8 billion.  In April, it settled with bond insurer Assured Guaranty for $1.6 billion.

41,BK,UPDATE 2-NY seeks to intervene in BoA $8.5 bln pact," * New York AG says must intervene to protect marketplace   * Joins growing number of investors opposing settlement  (Adds byline details on settlement, New York Attorney General’s complaint, banks decline comment)   By Andrew Longstreth and Joe Rauch   NEW YORK/CHARLOTTE, N.C., Aug 4 (Reuters) - New York’s attorney general will oppose Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) $8.5 billion settlement over repurchasing toxic mortgage loans, joining a growing number of unhappy mortgage bond buyers now fighting the pact reached with some of the largest institutional investors in the country.     In court papers filed late Thursday, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sought to intervene in order to “protect the marketplace and the interests of New York investors, the vast majority of whom otherwise are not present before the Court in this proceeding.”   In late June, BofA settled an eight-month dispute with outside investors who bought Countrywide Financial Corp mortgage bonds.   The investors — including Pacific Investment Management Co, or PIMCO, and BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) — requested the bank repurchase toxic home loans that comprised a series of mortgage-backed securities.   BofA, the investors and securities trustee Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N) agreed to an $8.5 billion settlement that applies to all investors in nearly all Countrywide Financial-created mortgage bonds, but the deal must be approved by a New York court.   The attorney general said in a filing the accord may interfere with his ability to pursue claims against the banks involved, and claims that BofA and Bank of New York may have violated their fiduciary duties in reaching the agreement.   Bank of America and Bank of New York spokesmen declined to comment.   The case is In re: The Bank of New York Mellon, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 651786/2011.

42,BK,US banks may seek relief from insurance fee surge," * Some banks seeing increase in deposits   * FDIC charges banks fee for deposit insurance fund   * BNY Mellon has sought to pass along costs to customers   By Dave Clarke   WASHINGTON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - U.S. banks might seek regulatory relief from costs associated with a flood of deposits, as investors seek safe places for their money, a top Washington banking official said on Monday.   Wayne Abernathy, a top official with the American Bankers Association, said it would be a concern for banks if the temporary surge in deposits due to market turmoil led to banks having to pay higher insurance fees on the short-term bloat.   “We’ve seen a little more than subtle shift of people out of money market funds and into deposits,” he said.   More deposits mean banks have to pay more fees to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, which insures customer deposits up to $250,000.   The fees are assessed on a quarterly basis and are calculated using the banks’ daily average deposit and asset levels.   Abernathy said that, if banks feel they will get hit by a big insurance bill, they would likely ask the FDIC to account for the unusual market conditions when determining the quarterly payment due.   He said banks could make the following case to the FDIC: “Don’t you want to take this temporary bump ... into account when assessing us for deposit insurance, and not making us pay for this adjustment?”   An FDIC spokesman declined to speculate on what the agency might do if banks were to make such an appeal.   Last week, Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) said it was seeing a “transient” flood of deposits that could drive up its regulatory insurance costs. It said it would start charging a fee to big customers with unusually high balances to help absorb those costs.

43,BK,"BNY Mellon to cut about 1,500 jobs","BOSTON (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) plans to cut about 1,500 jobs, or 3 percent of its workforce, to stem rising expenses.  The job cuts are the latest in the financial industry, as institutions brace for slower-than-expected economic growth.  A spokesman for the New York bank, Kevin Heine, said on Wednesday it expects to provide more detail about the job cuts by the end of the year and an exact timetable and the number of layoffs to take place have not been determined.  The bank plans to reduce the total number of layoffs by starting a hiring freeze and through natural turnover, BNY Mellon Chief Executive Robert Kelly said in a statement.  Although the bank’s revenue has grown in recent quarters, Kelly said, “expenses have been growing unsustainably faster.”  The move is only the latest large layoff by a major bank amid broader economic concerns. Last week Britain’s HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) said it would cut 30,000 jobs as it pulls back from countries including the United States and Russia.  Other firms have cut smaller numbers of jobs this summer, including BNY Mellon’s chief trust bank rival, State Street Corp (STT.N). On July 19 the Boston company said it would eliminate as many as 850 technology jobs through layoffs and outsourcing.  BNY Mellon had already promised other cost-containment efforts, such as moving employees to lower-cost locations including Pittsburgh; Manchester, England; and India.  In a securities filing, BNY Mellon said it plans to take a restructuring charge tied to the job cuts in the second half of 2011, the amount of which it did not specify. The charge will be “more than offset” by a gain from its previously announced sale of a stake in financial technology provider ConvergEx Group.

45,BK,UPDATE 2-Two states sue BNY Mellon over FX trades," * Virginia and Florida claim BNY Mellon overcharged on FX   * Virginia seeks over $811 mln in civil penalties   * BNY and State Street subject of long running claims  (Adds detail about lawsuits, background, bylines)   By Ross Kerber and Dan Levine   BOSTON/SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 11 (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N) was sued by two U.S. states on Thursday over allegations that the company overcharged pension funds on foreign exchange transactions.   The moves by Florida and Virginia escalate a legal battle over claims that custodial banks routinely overcharged their clients. California sued State Street Corp (STT.N) in 2009 over similar allegations.   BNY Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine said the bank would fight the latest claims leveled by Florida and Virginia.   “The lawsuits filed by the Virginia and Florida attorneys general are unwarranted and reflect a flawed understanding of foreign currency markets,” said Heine.   He added: “While our first choice is always an amicable resolution, we refuse to be coerced into paying for and admitting to wrongdoing where none exists.”   Virginia’s suit claims BNY Mellon assigned forex rates to the Virginia pension funds that were at the extremes of the ranges at which currencies actually traded on a given day — rather than the actual rate at which the bank internally accounted for the trades.   The spread between the rates “generated the tremendous amount of undisclosed income” for the bank at the expense of the funds, the suit states. The Florida lawsuit makes similar claims.   High-level bank executives were aware of the arrangement, the Virginia suit also states. It quotes an email from one executive who wrote the standing-instruction trades were the most profitable and worried that fuller transparency for clients would lead to reduced fees.   Virginia and Florida had previously announced an intention to sue BNY Mellon. In both lawsuits filed by the two states on Thursday, officials technically were joining in whistleblower claims originally filed by FX Analytics.   Virginia’s suit identifies FX Analytics as a Delaware partnership and connected to a former BNY Mellon employee working in its Pittsburgh offices.   Legal allies also have described the partnership as being tied to famed Massachusetts fraud investigator Harry Markopolos, who tried unsuccessfully for years to warn officials of the Bernard Madoff’s well-known Ponzi scheme.   According to a court document filed on Thursday, Virginia seeks over $811 million in civil penalties from BNY Mellon, along with triple damages totaling $120 million.   BNY Mellon has previously argued that clients of its forex services knew what they were getting into when they opted for ‘standing instruction’ services that are typically used for smaller forex transactions - those of less than $1 million needed to get the best “wholesale” interbank rates.   As the bank put it in a statement: “(T)he fiduciary obligation and decision-making for these FX transactions - including decisions to participate in the standing instruction program - rests with our clients and their investment managers. We act only at their direction.”   The Virginia case in the Circuit Court for the County of Fairfax is Commonwealth of Virginia et al. v. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, CL-2009-15377.

48,BK,S&P;: Lower loan losses boost regional bank profits,"   * Stable outlooks on large U.S. regional and trust banks   * Fundamentals “continued to improve” in second quarter   BOSTON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Lower loan loss provisions and higher outstanding loan balances drove a 19 percent rise in the net income of large U.S. regional and trust banks as a group in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the first quarter, Standard & Poor’s said in a report on Thursday.   The New York rating agency said the outlooks on most of the banks are stable as the industry’s fundamentals continued to improve in the three months ending in June.   Though the report covered a historic period, it could reinforce investor attitudes toward the sector compared with some larger U.S. and European banks that have faced more recent scrutiny.   The agency’s report reviewed regional banks including BB&T Corp (BBT.N), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB.O) and KeyCorp. (KEY.N) As a group their average nonaccrual loans fell 41 basis points in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, to 2.9 percent. Many banks again reported expecting fewer troubled loans.   For big trust banks including State Street Corp (STT.N) and Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), meanwhile, new business helped boost fees from asset servicing and investment management, the agency wrote.   Though some regional banks have recently raised dividends the agency said it expects them “to be generally conservative in their shareholder return policies” in the future.

50,BK,"Layoffs sweep Wall Street, along with low morale","NEW YORK (Reuters) - In early summer, before layoffs began sweeping across Wall Street, billboard-sized photos of employees were plastered on the walls, pillars and elevator banks of Credit Suisse Group AG’s offices in the United States and abroad.  The museum-quality prints, depicting workers from administrative assistants to senior executives, were emblazoned with motivational words like “Proactive” and “Partner.” By mid-July, however, the photos disappeared and the Swiss banking giant began laying off 2,000 employees.  Security guards prevented employees from taking cell-phone pictures as the posters were stripped away, according to one employee who was present.  “It sent an entirely wrong message,” said an employee, who was not authorized to speak publicly. “Management literally threw away that kind of money on something so trivial, while planning to cut thousands of jobs.”  A bank spokeswoman declined to comment on the internal campaign or the employee’s comments.  Credit Suisse’s timing illustrates the unanticipated dangers of rampant job-cutting, which tend to run in cycles on Wall Street. Employee morale often plummets at a time when survivors are asked to pick up more responsibility and customer relations can suffer as service and relationships deteriorate.  What’s more, layoffs inartfully constructed can come across to shareholders as Band-Aid solutions that at best temporarily cut expenses and at worst pare away reserves of talented people.  “They finished cutting the fat and now they’re into the muscle and bone,” said Tim White, a managing partner who specializes in wealth management at the recruiting firm Kaye/Bassman International in Dallas.  Credit Suisse has plenty of company in its cost-cutting campaign. HSBC, Barclays PLC, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Bank of New York Mellon Corp have announced plans to ax thousands of workers in recent months. On Thursday, Bank of America Corp Chief Executive Brian Moynihan sent a memo to senior executives outlining plans to cut another 3,500 jobs. (Graphic: r.reuters.com/cut33s)  The planned cuts at Bank of America have pushed the number of financial sector layoffs this year to 18,252 — 6 percent higher than in the comparable period in 2010, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm that keeps a daily tab on layoff announcements.  Some companies began the culling earlier this year — HSBC has already axed about 5,000 employees, with 25,000 more set to get pink slips by the end of 2012 — and others, such as Goldman Sachs, said that cuts will come by year’s end.  That is not good for morale.  Hours have become longer, trading floors have more open seats and fresh young faces are taking over offices where high-level personnel once sat. The highest-paid people can be easy targets for layoffs now, given the cost of keeping them employed and the eagerness of younger workers to take on their roles, even at less pay, executive recruiters said.  Changes in pay structures mandated in part by the Dodd-Frank financial reform laws have exacerbated the problem.  Banks that used to pay modest base salaries supplemented by opulent stock-and-option packages that encouraged meeting short-term performance goals now are weighting compensation toward base salary.  Managing directors at investment banks have seen a typical base salary double to $400,000, said Paul Sorbera, president of Alliance Consulting. Meanwhile, 2011 bonuses are expected to fall by up to 30 percent for top earners, according to pay consulting firm Johnson Associates.  The shift erodes Wall Street’s former flexibility to lower end-of-year bonuses in bad times and forces a heavier reliance on layoffs.  The danger is that client service suffers.  “Banking clients abhor relationship-manager turnover,” said Heather Hammond, a senior member of Russell Reynolds’ financial services practice.  Investors, for their part, tend to view cost-cutting as a short-term solution that fails to address fundamental issues relating to capital, strategy and the ability to endure through hard economic times.  At Credit Suisse, some senior jobs have been consolidated as executives have been escorted toward early retirement with offers of bonus bridges and other payments, sources familiar with the matter say.  Managing directors in businesses that have missed revenue targets have been told to reduce millions of dollars’ worth of headcount expenses, according to a managing director who received such a request. In some areas, including operations, legal and technology, more work is being outsourced and mid-level employees are being replaced by consultants.  “People are leaving resumes on the printers, hoping someone picks it up,” the Credit Suisse employee said.  Some sources believe that banks are repeating their typical hiring strategy: Cutting staff levels too deeply in bad times only to rush out with open checkbooks when markets recover.  “When people are getting hired, fired, hired, fired, every two years, it’s very difficult to run a business,” said Conrad Ciccotello, a finance professor at Georgia State University who has studied the issue. “There is precious human capital destroyed in vicious boom-and-bust cycles that is costly to replace.”  (Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by Richard Chang  and Jan Paschal)",8222011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wallstreet-layoffs/layoffs-sweep-wall-street-along-with-low-morale-idUSTRE77K1OU20110822

52,BK,"Humidity, volatility fail to deter banker flow to Asia"," HONG KONG, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Abhay Pande is getting adjusted to Singapore’s year-round heat and tropical humidity. His living space is tighter, compared to the New York home where he and his family used to live.  	   Though the Citigroup banker misses the summer breeze and ample room of his suburban, U.S. Northeast life, he was pleased to find his work schedule buzzing with activity, the minute he arrived in Asia.      	   “They asked JFK why he was running for president and he said: ‘That’s where the action is.’ Professionally, this part of the world is where the action is,” said Pande, Citi’s head of industrials global banking for Southeast Asia. He arrived in Singapore about two weeks ago with his wife and two children.	   Asia’s financial markets are down this year, and while hiring continues in certain areas, the industry is a long way off from its high-flying days before the credit crisis. 	   Still, a steady stream of U.S. and European-based bankers continue to make the long trek East, to cities like Hong Kong and Singapore, where the overall fee pool is smaller but where economic growth keeps business opportunities flowing.	   The volume of primary stock offerings has grown every year since 2008, with Hong Kong the top city for IPOs globally the last two, at one point hosting more offerings than New York or London combined. Bond issuance hit a record last year.    	   Asia billionaires reached a record high of 332 this year according to Forbes magazine. That has helped fuel demand for jobs in Singapore, where Asia’s wealth management industry has historically been based. 	   “Over the next 20 to 40 years, Asia is going to be the principle growth driver for the global economy,” Pande said.	   EX-PAT LIFE	   Rajiv Lulla recently moved to Hong Kong, looking to get closer to Asian markets and to his family in India.  	   Lulla, Asia head of transportation investment banking for Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, started in the new job about three months ago. 	   He was previously based in Paris, where his wife would buy fresh produce and groceries every morning in a street market next to the home where they lived with their two sons.	   She now slogs through Hong Kong’s famous wet markets, walking past loud and smelly stalls of bloody fish heads, dried seahorses and murky tanks of eels, bass, crabs and other crawling, slithering ocean life.	   For those who prefer, expensive foreign produce and meats are available too in the high-end markets located closer to Hong Kong’s Central district, and the island’s upscale south side.      	   “Hong Kong is unique in that it provides tremendous opportunity to immerse yourself in the Chinese culture, but still retains the comforts of the west and what you’re used to,” said Lulla, who was unpacking the last boxes from the move last weekend.	    Citigroup , which derived the majority of its global net income from Asia in the fourth quarter, has moved 10 directors to its Asia Pacific global banking business from other regions. RBS , Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse  have also recently relocated bankers from London, New York and Paris.	   AlixPartners, Fortress Investment Group , Fidelity Investments and Bank of New York Mellon shifted executives this year to Hong Kong and Singapore from cities such as Pittsburgh, Chicago and Stockholm.	   Apart from the business opportunities, financial industry executives are also drawn to the Asia expatriate lifestyle, which rarely changes despite market volatility; An easy commute to work, lower taxes, exciting travel, top tier international schools and high-quality, affordable domestic help. 	   The overseas life is not always one of excitement and luxury. Stories abound of individuals and families quickly heading back, either because a job opportunity dried up, the lifestyle adjustment was too extreme, the distance from home too great, or a combination of all three.  	   For Simon Clarke, a managing director at Citi Private Bank who moved to Hong Kong in December, the 10-minute cab ride to work is as good a reason as any for his new environs. A far shorter trip than his London work haul, his time is now freed up to network or play field hockey for a local team in nearby Happy Valley.	   “One of the main benefits of Hong Kong is the lack of a commute, because it means that you have more time to spend with people or play sports,” Clarke added. “As far as private banking is concerned, Asia is where the money is and clearly Hong Kong is the gateway to China, which is a huge centre.”	 	  (Reporting by Elzio Barreto; Editing by Michael Flaherty)	  ",8222011,http://www.reuters.com/article/finance-asia-bankers/humidity-volatility-fail-to-deter-banker-flow-to-asia-idUSL4E7JJ0ZS20110822
53,BK,REFILE-Deals in US financial adviser industry down in Q2," (Refiles to fix spelling of ‘financial’ in headline)   * 7 deals involving RIAs in Q2 vs 11 in Q1   * 5 deals made by banks, 2 by investment advisers   * Median AUM of firms acquired was $800 mln   * $8.5 bln in total assets exchanged, up from $6 bln in Q1   TORONTO, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Merger and acquisition activity in the U.S. financial advisory industry in the second quarter was down from the first three months of the year, but the amount of assets exchanged increased, according to a report released on Tuesday.   There were seven transactions involving retail-focused Registered Investment Adviser (RIA) firms with at least $50 million in assets under management or $500,000 in annual revenue in the second quarter of 2011, the report from Pershing Advisor Solutions said.   That compares with 11 deals in the first quarter, and 10 in the year-before quarter.   Five of the seven deals were made by banks, while the other two were made by financial advisory firms. So-called serial acquirers were absent from the deal space in the quarter.   In 2010, banks accounted for just 13 percent of all deals completed, the report said.   Notable deals in the quarter included SunTrust Banks’ (STI.N) acquisition of CSI Capital Management in May for an undisclosed amount, adding $1.5 billion in assets under management to the bank’s private wealth division.   The largest non-bank deal happened in April with the merger of the investment management firms Horizon Asset Management and Kinetics Asset Management. Once the deal is complete, the combined entity will have about $9.8 billion in assets under management.   The median assets under management of the firms acquired in the second quarter was $800 million, twice the median amount of assets exchanged in the previous quarter.   Nearly half the purchases included RIAs with more than $1 billion in assets. The total assets exchanged, around $8.5 billion, was up from just over $6 billion in the first quarter.

54,BK,Judge allows intervention in BofA $8.5 billion pact,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York state judge granted the request of dozens of investors including pension funds, insurers and several Federal Home Loan Banks to intervene in Bank of America Corp’s proposed $8.5 billion settlement with investors who lost money on mortgage-backed securities.  Justice Barbara Kapnick of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan granted the request, which was not opposed by the bank or by Bank of New York Mellon Corp, the trustee that negotiated the accord with 22 investors including BlackRock Inc and Allianz SE’s Pimco.  Some investors have objected that the $8.5 billion payout is too low, and that the settlement extinguishes claims they might otherwise have against Bank of America. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman also has expressed opposition.  Bank of New York Mellon has contended that the settlement is fair. Bank of America hopes that the accord will address many of its remaining liabilities from its 2008 purchase of mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp.  Kapnick has scheduled a November 17 hearing on the settlement.  The case is In re: The Bank of New York Mellon, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 651786/2011.

According to a Friday court filing, 11 entities sharing the name Walnut Place want to move the case to the U.S. District Court in Manhattan from the state supreme court in that borough.  They said the case qualifies as a “mass action” because of its size and complexity, making federal court jurisdiction appropriate. The matter has been in state court since June 29.  The settlement was intended to resolve much of Bank of America’s remaining legal liability tied to its disastrous 2008 purchase of mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp.

Investors unhappy with the payout or disclosures had until August 30 to intervene in the case, ahead of a November 17 court hearing. Friday’s filing may upset that timetable.  Bank of New York Mellon will seek to move the case back to state court and believes Walnut Place’s effort “is unsupported by the law and will only serve to delay the resolution of the proceeding,” bank spokesman Kevin Heine said.

In its filing with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the FDIC said it is “the receiver of numerous banks and owner of many certificates” issued by many of the 530 mortgage pools of the former Countrywide Financial Corp that the settlement covers.

60,BK,Fannie/Freddie regulator challenges BofA MBS pact,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as dozens of investors, on Tuesday lodged objections to Bank of America Corp’s proposed $8.5 billion mortgage-backed securities settlement.  Separately, a group of homeowners sued to block the accord, saying it would speed up foreclosures and prolong abuses in how mortgage loans are serviced. They are seeking a court order to force Bank of America to adopt and follow servicing policies that are “higher than current industry standards.”  The settlement covers 530 mortgage pools from the former Countrywide Financial Corp, which was the nation’s largest mortgage lender before Bank of America bought it in 2008.  Bank of New York Mellon Corp, the trustee handling the 530 trusts with $174 billion of unpaid principal balances, had negotiated the settlement with 22 institutional investors including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, BlackRock Inc and Allianz SE’s Pimco.  But some other investors say the payout is too low, or they lack enough information to know whether the accord is fair.  Lawrence Grayson, a bank spokesman, declined to comment, as did Bank of New York Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine.  In a court filing, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, called it a “positive” that the settlement calls for improving loan servicing and fixing deficient documentation, and said the support of many large market participants is “encouraging.”  Still, the FHFA said it lacks enough information about the accord, and wants to be ready to voice a “substantive” objection “should a now unforeseen issue arise” that hurts Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  “The FHFA sounds like it wants to preserve its right to contest refinements that could expose Fannie and Freddie to greater losses,” said Kathleen Engel, associate dean at Suffolk University Law School in Boston and co-author of “The Subprime Virus.”  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2010 guaranteed 70 percent of single-family mortgage-backed securities that were issued, and provided $1.03 trillion of market liquidity, an FHFA report to Congress in June shows.  Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer for the FHFA, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Meanwhile, the homeowners, who say they have received default notices, seek class-action status for Countrywide borrowers from 2004 to 2008 whose loans are in the trusts and are serviced by Bank of America.”  “The settlement agreement will speed up foreclosures, perpetuate existing servicing abuses in the system, and undermine federal programs designed to stabilize the housing market,” the complaint said.  Bank of America is among large U.S. banks negotiating with regulators nationwide on a potential multi-billion dollar settlement to improve foreclosure practices.  “It is not clear the borrowers have standing,” Engel said. “They certainly may be aggrieved by servicing problems, but they have to show the settlement itself causes them harm, either new injury or the loss of legal rights.”  A lawyer for the homeowners did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Several dozen objections to the $8.5 billion settlement were filed ahead of a Tuesday deadline to intervene in the case, which is overseen by New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick in Manhattan.  Some of the challenges were filed simultaneously in federal court, where some of the objectors hope to move the case.  American International Group Inc, the insurer suing Bank of America for $10 billion in a separate MBS case, and the National Credit Union Administration were among those to object on Tuesday to the accord.  Others that have objected include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, attorneys general of New York and Delaware, and various banks, insurers, investment funds and pension funds.  Bank of America paid $2.5 billion to buy Countrywide, but writedowns and legal costs have pushed the estimated cost of that purchase to more than $30 billion.

62,BK,BNY Mellon CEO Robert Kelly steps down,"BANGALORE (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) said Robert Kelly, who has held the company’s top job since 2008, has stepped down as chairman and chief executive officer, following differences in approach to managing the company.  The company, one of the world’s largest custody banks, said it named board member Gerald Hassell as chairman and CEO, effective immediately.  Kelly’s resignation was by “mutual agreement” with the board, BNY Mellon said in a statement.  Kelly, who served as CEO of Mellon Financial Corp prior to the merger of Bank of New York and Mellon Financial, took home $19.4 million as compensation in 2010.  Trust banks have avoided many of the credit issues that have weighed on larger traditional banks, but shares of BNY Mellon and its main rival State Street Corp (STT.N) have fallen this year as they operate in low interest rate environment with limited opportunities to cut costs.  The company, which also competes with Northern Trust (NTRS.O), announced a fee for large deposits — a move that was not immediately matched by competitors.  Earlier this month, BNY Mellon said it would cut about 1,500 jobs, or 3 percent of its workforce, to cope with rising costs.  Shares of the company were down 3 percent in trading after the bell. They closed at $20.67 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.  ",8312011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bnymellon/bny-mellon-ceo-robert-kelly-steps-down-idUSTRE77U71E20110831

64,BK,"Nevada, U.S. regulator challenge BofA on mortgages","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp’s mortgage practices came under fresh fire as state and federal regulators questioned whether the largest U.S. bank is doing what it must to address perceived harm to homeowners and investors.  Nevada’s attorney general on Tuesday accused the bank of repeatedly violating its $8.4 billion agreement with that state and others to address fraudulent lending charges involving its Countrywide unit, which it bought in 2008.  Catherine Cortez Masto, the state attorney general, asked a federal judge in Reno, Nevada, to let her back out of that accord and sue Bank of America on behalf of homeowners in Nevada, which has one of the nation’s highest foreclosure rates and percentages of borrowers who owe more than their homes are worth.  Separately on Tuesday, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as dozens of investors lodged objections to Bank of America’s proposed $8.5 billion settlement with investors in Countrywide mortgage-backed securities, an agreement negotiated by the trustee Bank of New York Mellon Corp.  Among the other objectors was Goldman Sachs Group Inc, which said it lacks enough information to know whether the accord treats all “similarly situated” investors equally.  And in a third proceeding, a group of homeowners sued to block that $8.5 billion accord, saying it would speed up foreclosures and prolong mortgage abuses. That group asked for a court order requiring the bank to follow servicing policies that are “higher than current industry standards.”  In her proposed complaint, the Nevada attorney general said Bank of America still engages in “a pattern and practice” of misleading consumers about such matters as why it denies mortgage modifications, or begins foreclosures while modification requests are pending.  Bank of America was to help 400,000 borrowers modify their home loans under the 2008 accord.  But Masto called the process “chaotic,” even accusing the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank of reprimanding workers for spending “too much time” on the phone — an average of seven to 10 minutes — with individual customers.  “Defendants’ deceptive practices have resulted in an explosion of delinquencies and unauthorized and unnecessary foreclosures” in Nevada, Masto said in court papers. “The state no longer can get the benefit of its original settlement.”  It is unclear how the allegations might affect long-running negotiations on a potential multibillion-dollar settlement with regulators nationwide to improve foreclosure practices at several big banks, including Bank of America.  “We disagree that there has been any material breach of the consent decree and will continue to vigorously defend this action.” Bank of America spokeswoman Jumana Bauwens said in response to the Nevada filings.  Lawrence Grayson, another bank spokesman, declined to comment on the other litigation matters, as did Bank of New York Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine.  The settlement with mortgage-backed securities covers 530 mortgage pools from the former Countrywide Financial Corp, the largest U.S. mortgage lender before Bank of America bought it.  Bank of New York Mellon had negotiated the accord, covering $174 billion of unpaid principal balances, with 22 big investors including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, BlackRock Inc and Allianz SE’s Pimco.  But some other investors say the payout is too low, or they lack enough information to know whether the accord is fair.  In a court filing, the FHFA called it a “positive” that the settlement calls for improving loan servicing and fixing deficient documentation, and said the support of many large market participants is “encouraging.”  Still, the FHFA said it lacks enough information about the accord, and wants to be ready to voice a “substantive” objection “should a now unforeseen issue arise.”  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2010 guaranteed 70 percent of single-family mortgage-backed securities that were issued, and provided $1.03 trillion of market liquidity, an FHFA report to Congress in June shows.  “The FHFA sounds like it wants to preserve its right to contest refinements that could expose Fannie and Freddie to greater losses,” said Kathleen Engel, associate dean at Suffolk University Law School in Boston and co-author of “The Subprime Virus.”  Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer for the FHFA, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Meanwhile, the homeowners, who say they have received default notices, seek class-action status for Countrywide borrowers from 2004 to 2008 whose loans are in the trusts and are serviced by Bank of America.”  “The settlement agreement will speed up foreclosures, perpetuate existing servicing abuses in the system, and undermine federal programs designed to stabilize the housing market,” the complaint said.  “It is not clear the borrowers have standing,” Engel said. “They certainly may be aggrieved by servicing problems, but they have to show the settlement itself causes them harm, either new injury or the loss of legal rights.”  A lawyer for the homeowners did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Bank of America paid $2.5 billion to buy Countrywide, but writedowns and legal costs have pushed the estimated cost of that purchase to more than $30 billion.  Several dozen objections to the $8.5 billion settlement were filed ahead of a Tuesday deadline to intervene in the case, which is overseen by New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick in Manhattan.  Some of the challenges were filed simultaneously in federal court, where some of the objectors hope to move the case.  American International Group Inc, the insurer suing Bank of America for $10 billion in a separate MBS case, is among the objectors. Others include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, attorneys general of New York and Delaware, and various banks, insurers, investment funds and pension funds.  US Bancorp, trustee for a $1.75 billion Countrywide mortgage pool, this week separately sued Bank of America to force it to buy back the underlying loans.  The Nevada case is Nevada v.

65,BK,"UPDATE 5-Nevada, US regulator challenge BofA on mortgages"," * Nevada says seeks to exit 2008 accord that bank violated   * Fannie/Freddie regulator challenge $8.5 bln accord   * Borrowers sue to block $8.5 bln accord  (Updates and recasts with Nevada lawsuit, Bank of America comment, paragraphs 1-13)   By Jonathan Stempel   NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) mortgage practices came under fresh fire as state and federal regulators questioned whether the largest U.S. bank is doing what it must to address perceived harm to homeowners and investors.   Nevada’s attorney general on Tuesday accused the bank of repeatedly violating its $8.4 billion agreement with that state and others to address fraudulent lending charges involving its Countrywide unit, which it bought in 2008.   Catherine Cortez Masto, the state attorney general, asked a federal judge in Reno, Nevada, to let her back out of that accord and sue Bank of America on behalf of homeowners in Nevada, which has one of the nation’s highest foreclosure rates and percentages of borrowers who owe more than their homes are worth.   Separately on Tuesday, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB, as well as dozens of investors lodged objections to Bank of America’s proposed $8.5 billion settlement with investors in Countrywide mortgage-backed securities, an agreement negotiated by the trustee Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N).   Among the other objectors was Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), which said it lacks enough information to know whether the accord treats all “similarly situated” investors equally.   And in a third proceeding, a group of homeowners sued to block that $8.5 billion accord, saying it would speed up foreclosures and prolong mortgage abuses. That group asked for a court order requiring the bank to follow servicing policies that are “higher than current industry standards.”   In her proposed complaint, the Nevada attorney general said Bank of America still engages in “a pattern and practice” of misleading consumers about such matters as why it denies mortgage modifications, or begins foreclosures while modification requests are pending.   Bank of America was to help 400,000 borrowers modify their home loans under the 2008 accord.   But Masto called the process “chaotic,” even accusing the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank of reprimanding workers for spending “too much time” on the phone — an average of seven to 10 minutes — with individual customers.   “Defendants’ deceptive practices have resulted in an explosion of delinquencies and unauthorized and unnecessary foreclosures” in Nevada, Masto said in court papers. “The state no longer can get the benefit of its original settlement.”   It is unclear how the allegations might affect long-running negotiations on a potential multibillion-dollar settlement with regulators nationwide to improve foreclosure practices at several big banks, including Bank of America.   “We disagree that there has been any material breach of the consent decree and will continue to vigorously defend this action.” Bank of America spokeswoman Jumana Bauwens said in response to the Nevada filings.   Lawrence Grayson, another bank spokesman, declined to comment on the other litigation matters, as did Bank of New York Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine.   The settlement with mortgage-backed securities covers 530 mortgage pools from the former Countrywide Financial Corp, the largest U.S. mortgage lender before Bank of America bought it.

66,BK,U.S. judge pans rush in BofA $8.5 billion mortgage pact,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A judge questioned why Bank of America Corp’s $8.5 billion settlement with mortgage securities investors was being rushed for approval and whether the trustee that negotiated it treated investors fairly.  U.S. District Judge William Pauley set a September 21 hearing to consider requests from some investors to move the case to Manhattan federal court from a New York state court, where the trustee Bank of New York Mellon Corp wants it handled.  That timetable is slower than Bank of New York Mellon wanted and could imperil a scheduled November 17 hearing before New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick to consider approving the settlement.  “It strikes me there are some novel and complex issues,” Pauley said at a hearing on Thursday. “The court would benefit from some fulsome briefing.”  A delay could help unhappy investors learn more through additional litigation, which could lead to higher payouts.  “There’s nothing special about the dates,” said Owen Cyrulnik, a lawyer for 11 investment entities sharing the Walnut Place name that have challenged the accord. “None of these dates are set in stone.”  The settlement covers 530 mortgage pools with $174 billion of unpaid principal balances from Countrywide Financial Corp, which was the largest U.S. mortgage lender before Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America bought it in 2008.  Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Bank of New York Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine declined to comment. Bank of America were down 14 cents at $8.03 in afternoon trading.  The settlement was negotiated by the trustee with 22 institutional investors such as BlackRock Inc and Allianz SE’s Pimco and also requires Bank of America to improve its mortgage servicing practices.  But 44 groups of investors, including banks, hedge funds, insurers and pension funds, complained they do not have enough information to know whether the accord is fair. Some say the 5 cents on the dollar payout is too low. Others suggested Bank of New York Mellon has conflicts of interest.  Among those investors seeking to intervene were Walnut Place, American International Group Inc, the regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  At Thursday’s hearing, Pauley asked Matthew Ingber, a lawyer for Bank of New York Mellon, why the bank seemed to push for a quick settlement and failed to notify all of the trust beneficiaries.  “What is the extreme exigency here?” Pauley said. “You did unilaterally just fix those dates, and the state court judge went along with it ... in a vacuum.”  Ingber said quick approval would assure the return of money to investors and improve Bank of America’s mortgage servicing.  NO OPT-OUT  But Pauley questioned Bank of New York Mellon’s decision to seek approval of the accord through a so-called Article 77 proceeding, which under New York law lets a trustee seek a judicial endorsement of trust-related decisions.  It is usually invoked in smaller disputes rather than large commercial cases and the judge said its “main benefit appears to limit the right of the trust beneficiaries to opt out.”  That makes a resolution to an Article 77 case unlike a typical class-action settlement, which the Bank of America accord resembles in other respects.  Ingber said Bank of New York Mellon in fact was “open and transparent,” adding: “I disagree with the premise that we’re not giving others opportunities to be heard.”  Pauley also challenged the bank’s reliance on opinions from professors and mortgage specialists to help it settle the $8.5 billion payout.  “How can any expert opine on the amount a certificate holder could recover through litigation?” he said.  Prior to setting the September 21 hearing date, Pauley gave Walnut Place until September 14 to file papers. He then chided Ingber’s request for a week to respond.  “Now it’s not so expedited,” the judge said.  He gave two days.

68,BK,BNY Mellon CEO Kelly steps down,"BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon’s (BK.N) Chief Executive Robert Kelly stepped down in a surprise move, because of what the company said was “differences in approach to managing the company.”  BNY Mellon, one of the largest trust and custody banks, did not elaborate on why Kelly, 57, was stepping down. The bank did say the decision was a mutual agreement with the bank’s board. A biography still posted on BNY Mellon’s website noted that Kelly “was named one of America’s Best CEO’s for 2009” by Institutional Investor magazine.  Gerald Hassell, BNY Mellon’s 59-year-old president, is taking over as chairman and chief executive. He has been with BNY Mellon and before that Bank of New York for three decades.  BNY Mellon is looking to cut costs as low interest rates have cut into its earnings growth, and it has been struggling with lawsuits alleging it overcharged pension funds for foreign exchange trades.  “This is an extreme surprise,” said Gerard Cassidy, analyst at RBC Capital Markets.  “The company is currently facing two major issues, the planned downsizing and the ongoing foreign exchange litigation. We don’t know how or if his departure was related to them,” Cassidy added.  The bank’s shares have fallen by nearly a third this year, underperforming competitor State Street Corp (STT.N) whose shares have fallen by about 23 percent. On Wednesday before the announcement, BNY Mellon’s shares closed down 0.72 percent to $20.67. In after hours trading, shares fell another 1.3 percent.  Kelly joined Mellon Financial Corp in 2006, after having served was Chief Financial Officer of Wachovia, which was later acquired by Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) When Bank of New York took over Mellon in 2007, Kelly became Chairman and CEO of the combined company.  He has considered leaving the bank before. In 2009, he was in conversations to become the next chief executive of Bank of America Corp, (BAC.N) but a deal never happened out.  Another key bank executive left earlier this year — Ronald O’Hanley, who headed BNY Asset Management, moved over Fidelity to head their asset management and corporate services unit.  BNY Mellon, like other trust and custody banks, manages cash for companies and handles back-office processing of securities and banking transactions for fund managers, among its other businesses. The bank does not have retail branches, but it did have $26.3 trillion of assets under custody and administration as of June 30, and $1.3 trillion of assets under management.  Low interest rates have squeezed profit growth which hamper a number of their businesses. The company said earlier in August that it plans to cut about 1,500 jobs, or 3 percent of its workforce, to stem rising expenses. Kelly said at the time that although revenue was rising, “expenses have been growing unsustainably faster.”  The bank has also faces multiple accusations of having overcharged pension funds for foreign exchange trades by failing to charge the funds the rates that the banks paid, and instead forcing them to pay the highest rates of the day.  Recent market volatility also gave BNY Mellon more deposits than it felt it could comfortably invest, forcing it to charge extra to customers that boosted deposits dramatically over the summer.  Kelly earned $19.4 million in 2010, making him among the best paid CEOs of a public U.S. company.

The bank does not have retail branches, but it did have $26.3 trillion of assets under custody and administration as of June 30, and $1.3 trillion of assets under management.   Low interest rates have squeezed profit growth  which hamper a number of their businesses. The company said earlier in August that it plans to cut about 1,500 jobs, or 3 percent of its workforce, to stem rising expenses. Kelly said at the time that although revenue was rising, “expenses have been growing unsustainably faster.”   The bank has also faces multiple accusations of having overcharged pension funds for foreign exchange trades by failing to charge the funds the rates that the banks paid, and instead forcing them to pay the highest rates of the day.   Recent market volatility also gave BNY Mellon more deposits than it felt it could comfortably invest, forcing it to charge extra to customers that boosted deposits dramatically over the summer.

78,BK,UPDATE 1-BNY Mellon's new CEO vows no strategy change," * BNY Mellon veteran Gerald Hassell took over Aug. 31   * Hassell says bank will keep defending forex suits   By Ross Kerber   Sept 13 (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) needs no strategy change and will continue to defend itself against lawsuits over its foreign exchange operations, new Chairman and Chief Executive Gerald Hassell said on Tuesday.   Neither comment would ordinarily draw much attention except that Hassell’s remarks were his first in public since he was named to head the New York custody bank on Aug. 31, after his predecessor in both roles, Robert Kelly, unexpectedly quit.   The bank has only explained Kelly’s departure as “due to differences in approach to managing the company” and has given no other details. Hassell was not asked about the succession on Tuesday as he spoke at a Barclays Capital financial services conference in New York, which was webcast.   Hassell’s remarks gave no clue what those differences may have been, however, and he wasted no time before declaring that investors should expect few changes.   “Right away, we have the right strategy, we have a great biz model,” Hassell said at the start of his talk.   One of his main goals, Hassell said, will be to improve collaboration inside the bank’s operations, ranging from its big custody business, with $26 trillion in assets under custody and administration, to more traditional investment units.   “We’re focused on execution, execution, execution, that’s what it’s all about,” Hassell said.   A major effort under Kelly had been cost-cutting and Hassell said the company remained on track in developing expense-reduction plans it will describe in November.   Under Kelly, the bank had also defended itself against a slew of lawsuits claiming it had artificially boosted profits in its foreign exchange operations, at the expense of big pension funds and other investors.   The bank had previously denied wrongdoing and Hassell vowed to maintain its defenses. “We’re going to continue to do it. We feel like we should stand up for ourselves, given our practices, but we will be pragmatic,” he said.   Hassell’s record as an insider stands in contrast to Kelly, who joined what was then Mellon Financial Corp in 2006, before its merger with The Bank of New York in 2007.   Hassell began his career with The Bank of New York more than three decades ago.

It also analyzed trades handled for the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association between May 2000 and September 2010.  The Journal analysis found the custodial bank at times separately executed trades when one client needed to buy and sell the same currencies on the same day, instead of “matching” the trades to offset each other in a single trade.  BNY reported separate purchases and sales of the currencies at the cost of $3.2 million to the Massachusetts fund when all or portions of 10,288 trades involving about $570 million worth of foreign-currency purchases could have been netted out at no cost, the Journal found.  In the past few months, BNY has been criticized regarding its foreign exchange operations for pension funds. The custodial bank recently said it would continue to defend itself.  For the Los Angeles fund, the Journal found that BNY charged $171,000 as cost of transaction for all or portions of 446 trades involving about $22 million worth of foreign-currency purchases that could have been netted out at no cost with sales of the same foreign currencies the fund made on the same days.

84,BK,Judge to solve puzzle over BoFA mortgage removal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp’s $8.5 billion proposed mortgage-backed securities settlement is now in the hands of a New York federal judge. But it could end up back before state court in a legal tug-of-war over who should decide whether the pact passes muster.  The stakes are high for Bank of America, which had hoped the agreement would resolve uncertainty over potential liabilities tied to pools of soured loans sold to investors by Countrywide Financial Corp, the mortgage lender it bought in 2008.  While the proposed settlement was filed in state court in June as a special proceeding and not as a class action, an investor group called Walnut Place LLC removed the case to federal court in late August, arguing it should be treated as a “mass action” under a federal law.  The case is now before U.S. District Judge William Pauley, who may have reasons under class-action law to return the case to New York State Supreme Court, according to some experts.  Or, as sometimes happens in removals, the federal judge keeps the case and the state action ceases unless there are developments later that cause it to be remanded to state court for different reasons.  The settlement was negotiated by Bank of New York Mellon, the trustee for mortgage backed securities in Countrywide, with 22 institutional investors such as BlackRock Inc and Allianz SE’s Pimco. Countrywide was the largest U.S. mortgage lender before being taken over by BofA. The agreement also calls for the biggest U.S. bank by assets to improve its mortgage servicing practices.  On September 21, Pauley will hear oral arguments for the bid by Walnut Place for the case to be resolved under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 that requires big-money class actions to be supervised by a federal judge.  “There have been various ways in which the federal court has managed to kick removals out without giving it much of a review but I prefer to think judges see it as part of their job,” said Eugene Beckham of Beckham and Beckham PA in Miami, who has written about removal procedures but is not involved in the mortgage settlement case.  “However, the federal courts can be very unforgiving and if you don’t follow the rules or you don’t have the right allegations they will usually remand it,” Beckham said.  He said that can lead to an attorney fee award or sanctions against lawyers deemed to have incorrectly removed a case.  Lawyers for law firm Grais & Ellsworth are leading the challenge for Walnut Place against the Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) settlement.  Walnut Place owns certificates in three of the 530 trusts that are part of the proposed agreement. It argues that the negotiations were held in secret, but BNYM says that BofA said in a December 2010 press release it was in talks with the trustee and institutional investors over trusts, including one in which Walnut Place holds certificates.  BNYM, and some lawyers who are not involved in the litigation said that under the class-action law cited by Walnut, a party needs to be a defendant and there needs to be a claim for monetary relief to have standing to remove the case.  But Walnut’s lawyers said in court papers on Wednesday night that neither of those arguments are plausible.  “Walnut Place intervened as an adverse respondent in the state court proceeding, and BNYM did not oppose the petition to intervene or disagree with its characterization of Walnut Place as an adverse party,” its memorandum said. It said monetary relief “surely” was the $8.5 billion that the trustee had asked the court to direct Bank of America and Countrywide to pay.  Another CAFA requirement is that there must be 100 or more plaintiffs who have filed lawsuits seeking monetary damages. In this case, there is only one plaintiff, the trustee, BNYM.  “It doesn’t immediately appear obvious to me what the tactical benefits would be of removal,” said Chris Keller, partner at Labaton Sucharow, whose two New York pension fund clients were part of a $624 million settlement in Countrywide securities litigation in February.  The proposed BofA settlement was made in New York State Supreme Court under Article 77, a provision that usually covers family trust matters. The agreement covers 530 mortgage pools with $174 billion of unpaid principal balances. BNYM said it took months of negotiations to reach a deal.  New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick rejected Walnut’s efforts to change the case to a class action and to add an “opt-out” provision typical in class actions but not in Article 77 proceedings.  Sara Shanahan, a litigation partner with law firm Sherin and Lodgen in Boston, said BNYM could argue that “if you’re going to remove, you do it early on the proceedings, you don’t get to remove once you think things are going badly for you in the state court proceedings.”  Pauley’s job is to determine whether the case was properly removed and properly pending in federal court, she said.  “If he’s wrong, then that issue can be challenged later on appeal after a lot of additional work,” Shanahan said.

In this case, there is only one plaintiff, the trustee, BNYM.   “It doesn’t immediately appear obvious to me what the tactical benefits would be of removal,” said Chris Keller, partner at Labaton Sucharow, whose two New York pension fund clients were part of a $624 million settlement in Countrywide securities litigation in February.   The proposed BofA settlement was made in New York State Supreme Court under Article 77, a provision that usually covers family trust matters. The agreement covers 530 mortgage pools with $174 billion of unpaid principal balances. BNYM said it took months of negotiations to reach a deal.   New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick rejected Walnut’s efforts to change the case to a class action and to add an “opt-out” provision typical in class actions but not in Article 77 proceedings.   Sara Shanahan, a litigation partner with law firm Sherin and Lodgen in Boston, said BNYM could argue that “if you’re going to remove, you do it early on the proceedings, you don’t get to remove once you think things are going badly for you in the state court proceedings.”   Pauley’s job is to determine whether the case was properly removed and properly pending in federal court, she said.   “If he’s wrong, then that issue can be challenged later on appeal after a lot of additional work,” Shanahan said.

The banking industry has been cutting jobs and reducing expenses to recoup losses and stem stock price declines as the macroeconomic crisis takes a toll for the second time in less than 2 years.	   Bank of America Corp recently said it will cut 30,000 jobs. In August, Bank of New York Mellon Corp said it plans to reduce 3 percent of its workforce. The market expects Wells Fargo & Co to take a similar approach.	  “Most of the headcount discussion that I think people are reading about doesn’t necessarily affect our user base,” Chief Operating Officer Peter Walsh said on a call with analysts.    	   The company, which provides financial information and analysis for the investment community, expects first-quarter earnings of 98 cents to $1.00 a share, on revenue of $195-$198 million.	   Factset, which competes with Thomson Reuters Corp   , IHS Inc , Fair Isaac Corp and Gartner Inc , reported a slightly better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit, helped by a 14 percent increase in annual subscription value (ASV). 	   Buy-side clients that include corporate financing and equity research, account for 82 percent of ASV.	   “A lot of our strategy now is going into these firms and finding new pockets of users. We have great opportunities amongst the senior bankers, in departments like sales, trading,” Walsh said. 	   The remainder of its ASV comes from sell-side firms, primarily merger advisory and equity research firms.	   “Sell-side firms increased the number of new junior bankers due to higher M&A volumes and a strong IPO environment over the past 12 months,” Walsh said.	   Shares of the company, which rose nearly 7 percent in the morning, were up 4 percent at $92.19 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

88,BK,"BofA mortgage pact no ""sweetheart"" deal: lawyer","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A proposed $8.5 billion settlement of Bank of America Corp’s mortgage-backed securities liability is not a “sweetheart deal” to help the bank, a lawyer for institutional investors argued in court on Wednesday in a legal tussle over the agreement.  A federal judge reserved decision after hearing oral arguments over whether or not the case should be sent back to New York state court, where Bank of New York Mellon Corp, the trustee for the mortgage securities, presented a settlement in June for approval.  Wednesday’s hearing was called because an investor group opposed to the settlement, Walnut Place LLC, moved the case to Manhattan federal court in late August, arguing it should be treated as a “mass action” under a federal law.  “This was no collusive, self-selective group of people who decided to get into a room and cut a sweetheart deal with Bank of America,” lawyer Robert Madden, representing 22 institutional investors who want the pact approved in state court, told the judge. “It was in no way intended to assist Bank of New York Mellon or Bank of America.”  U.S. District Judge William Pauley peppered lawyers for Bank of New York Mellon and Walnut Place with questions in the bid by Walnut for the case to be resolved under the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA) of 2005. CAFA requires big-money class actions to be supervised by a federal judge.  The judge gave the parties a week to file more written legal arguments.  The proposed settlement was filed in state court as a special proceeding known as Article 77 and not as a class action. Walnut Place argued in court papers that negotiations between the trustee and investors were held in secret.  The trustee said it gave public notice of talks over eight or nine months with investors including BlackRock Inc and Allianz SE’s Pimco.  The stakes are high for Bank of America, which had hoped the agreement would resolve uncertainty over potential liabilities tied to pools of soured loans sold to investors by Countrywide Financial Corp, the mortgage lender it bought in 2008. Countrywide was the largest U.S. mortgage lender before being taken over by BofA.  The proposed agreement also calls for the biggest U.S. bank by assets to improve its mortgage servicing practices.  Bank of New York Mellon lawyer Matthew Ingber asked Pauley to reject Walnut Place’s arguments to have the case continue before him.  “We are not extinguishing any rights of Walnut,” Ingber said. “We think Walnut should be standing side by side with the trustee.”  He said the $8.5 billion payment and the requirement that Bank of America improve its servicing could not otherwise be obtained.  Walnut Place’s lawyer, Owen Cyrulnik, said that in federal court there were equivalents to the Article 77 special proceeding, including the class-action statute.  “It would be amazing for a trustee to have the kind of discretion Bank of New York Mellon claims it has to settle on behalf of these trusts,” Cyrulnik said.  Walnut owns certificates in three of the 530 trusts that are part of the proposed agreement.  Article 77 in state court usually covers family trust matters.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said BNY Mellon misrepresented to customers the rates for foreign currency transactions over a 10-year period. Schneiderman said he is seeking a nationwide recovery of nearly $2 billion.   New York is the latest state to bring claims against BNY Mellon, which has been battling allegations of FX overcharging for months. Virginia and Florida filed lawsuits against the company in August.   A BNY Mellon spokesman said in a statement that the lawsuit was based on a “fundamental misunderstanding” of the foreign exchange market and the role of custodian banks.   “Simply put, this is the kind of prosecutorial overreach that ill serves New York, New Yorkers and the pension funds that the Office of New York Attorney General purports to represent,” said the spokesman.   The New York Attorney General said the suit, which was brought with the city of New York, adds new claims to an existing whistleblower action that was filed by FX Analytics in 2009.

95,BK,Forex probe ramps up as government steps in,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A years-long investigation into whether Bank of New York Mellon Corp and other banks overcharged clients on foreign-exchange transactions has risen to a new level with a civil fraud action by federal prosecutors who police Wall Street.  The move late Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Justice — and a separate lawsuit brought the same day by New York’s attorney general — rattled investors in BNY Mellon stock. Analysts said on Wednesday that the legal action adds to risks for the company, which along with State Street Corp is also facing foreign-exchange lawsuits in other states.  The Justice Department’s case was brought by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s civil frauds unit. He established the unit in March 2010 to bring new resources to fighting financial fraud and to seek redress for crimes they had not previously been able to. The lawsuit is only the second the office has brought under a relatively new law passed after the 1980s savings-and-loan scandal.  It accuses the custodial bank of improperly misrepresenting currency exchange rates to clients so that it can protect a lucrative part of its business.  “This is an application of the federal law in an area to the best of my knowledge that hasn’t been tried before and we’ll see how the courts react to it,” said Mark Rifkin, a shareholder lawyer at Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz in New York who is not involved in foreign-exchange litigation.  “The state lawsuit looks more straightforward — you said you were going to do one thing and you did something else,” he said of the New York state attorney general’s complaint.  BNY Mellon shares fell 57 cents, or 3 percent, to $18.25, in afternoon trading on Wednesday.  The new lawsuits “are a clear headline risk and a degree of fundamental risk,” Evercore Partners stock analyst Andrew Marquardt wrote in a research note. He said the news will weigh on shares” of BNY Mellon and, to a lesser extent, State Street. State Street stock was little changed, down 3 cents at $32.03.  BNY Mellon has signaled it would fight both lawsuits. Spokesman Kevin Heine said both sets of prosecutors had a “fundamental misunderstanding” of the foreign exchange market and the role of custodial banks. He said the lawsuits suffered “the same flawed analysis” of the banks’ services to clients in foreign exchange transactions.  Legal battles have raged for several years over claims that custodial banks, mainly BNY Mellon and State Street, routinely overcharged pension funds and other institutional clients on currency transactions.  State Street was sued in October 2009 by the California attorney general over its foreign-exchange practices. In August this year, state officials in Florida and Virginia sued BNY Mellon, joining whistleblower lawsuits originally filed by the group FX Analytics.  The latest lawsuits targeted BNY Mellon’s “standing instruction” service in which it provides clients with an as-needed basis for foreign exchange services. Prosecutors said that since 2000 the bank has been promising clients the best available rate but instead giving them the worst or nearly the worst and then making a profit for itself from the price differential.  The DoJ case brings claims under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, which allows prosecutors to recover civil penalties from financial firms involving violations such as mail fraud and wire fraud. The statute allows the government to sue entities that defraud consumers.  The federal complaint said that if Bank of New York Mellon had provided time stamps on when the trades were executed, it would have been easier to determine whether their rates were fair and reasonable.  “With an alleged fraud of this magnitude and scope, it is imperative for the United States to seek justice and reform on a broad scale while individual victims simultaneously pursue their own damages,” Bharara said in a statement.  Bharara’s office said the overcharges were a long-running practice and continued even after media reports of the State Street lawsuit in California. When the California lawsuit was publicized, “BNYM’s director of FX trading in New York emailed the Reuters report to all BNYM FX sales employees with the subject heading, ‘Oh No’,” Tuesday’s court papers contend.  BNY Mellon then was flooded with inquiries from clients and investment managers “about whether BNYM was engaging in similar pricing conduct” according to the federal lawsuit.  Tuesday’s lawsuits were separate actions, and neither the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office nor the New York State Attorney General referred to the other’s case in their respective press releases.  “When you see two agencies like that bringing charges within hours it could mean they coordinated the case but more times than not it is regulators trying to be the first to file charges,” said Chicago securities lawyer Andrew Stoltmann.

97,BK,Global accounting rule setter courts U.S. support,"BOSTON (Reuters) - The United States would still play a pivotal role in shaping global accounting rules if it switches to standards set by the international accounting body based in London, a top rule-maker said on Wednesday.  Hans Hoogervorst, chairman of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), sought in his first U.S. speech to reassure America that giving up sovereignty in accounting rulemaking would not mean a loss of influence for the world’s biggest capital market.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is due to announce by year end whether it will make the switch.  World leaders including President Barack Obama have committed themselves to a single set of global accounting rules to improve corporate reporting transparency.  But some in Congress and smaller American firms are leery about a loss of independence in standard setting and the extra costs of switching to global rules.  Hoogervorst said U.S. sovereignty would be protected by the SEC having a final say before any IASB rule is introduced.  “Such endorsement mechanisms provide an important ‘circuit breaker’ if the IASB produced a standard with fundamental problems for the United States,” Hoogervorst told an accounting conference.  The SEC would remain in full control of enforcement.  “So there is absolutely no danger of importing different enforcement standards from abroad into the United States,” the former Dutch finance minister added.  Big companies such as Archer-Daniel-Midland Co, Bank of New York Mellon Corp, Kellogg Co, Chrysler, United Continental Holdings Inc and Ford Motor Co have called for U.S. adoption of IASB rules, he added.  Hoogervorst said it would be reasonable that a relatively long transition to full adoption is provided, along with an option of early adoption for companies that want to.

101,BK,NY prosecutors sue BNY Mellon over forex claims,"(Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N) was sued on Tuesday by New York federal and state prosecutors who accused the bank of cheating clients in foreign exchange transactions.  In two separate lawsuits seeking in excess of $2 billion, the Manhattan U.S. Attorney and the New York Attorney General alleged the bank misled clients about the method for determining what currency exchange rates it used for certain foreign exchange transactions.  Both lawsuits targeted the “standing instruction” service offered by the bank in which it provides clients with an as-needed basis for foreign exchange services.  Prosecutors accused the bank of promising clients the best available rate but instead giving them the worst or nearly the worst and then making a profit for itself from the price differential.  The lawsuit filed in New York state court by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is seeking to recover nearly $2 billion for BNY Mellon clients nationwide.  Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said his lawsuit, filed in federal court, is seeking “hundreds of millions of dollars” in civil penalties on behalf of the government.  A BNY Mellon spokesman said in a statement that the New York Attorney General’s action was based on a “fundamental misunderstanding” of the foreign exchange market and the role of custodian banks.  “Simply put, this is the kind of prosecutorial overreach that ill serves New York, New Yorkers and the pension funds that the Office of New York Attorney General purports to represent,” said the spokesman.  He also said that the U.S. Attorney’s lawsuit is flawed.  “It fundamentally misunderstands and mischaracterizes the global foreign exchange market and the valuable services we provide to our clients as a principal in foreign exchange transactions,” he said.  According to the lawsuit filed by Schneiderman’s office, BNY Mellon made misrepresentations about its foreign exchange operations to some of the most recognizable corporations, investment funds, educational institutions, pension funds, and governmental organizations in the world, including Microsoft Corporation (MSFT.O), Sears, Roebuck & Co, the World Bank, Duke University, and The Walt Disney Company (DIS.N).  From 2001 to the present, the bank engaged in a “multi-pronged campaign of deception” designed to induce private and government clients into believing that they would receive the best rate of the day for their foreign currency transactions, the lawsuit said.  New York is the latest state to bring claims against BNY Mellon, which has been battling allegations of FX overcharging for months. Virginia and Florida filed lawsuits against the company in August.  The New York Attorney General said the lawsuit, which was brought with the city of New York, adds new claims to an existing whistleblower action that was filed under seal by FX Analytics in 2009. FX Analytics also first brought the lawsuits in Virginia and Florida.  The New York Attorney General’s lawsuit makes claims of violations of New York’s Martin Act, a powerful statute from the 1920s that has been used to investigate and prosecute securities fraud on Wall Street.  On behalf of clients who were New York city and state entities, the suit also said that BNY Mellon violated the New York city and state False Claims Acts.  The famous fraud investigator Harry Markopolos, who raised concerns about Bernard Madoff, said he was behind the FX Analytics lawsuits and that the New York Attorney General’s lawsuit was the biggest of its kind.  “This affects tens of millions of American retirees’ pension accounts,” he said.  The case brought by the U.S. Attorney brings claims under the Financial Institutional Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, which allows prosecutors to recover civil penalties for violating certain criminal statutes.  The state case is State of New York v. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 09/114735. Information about the federal case was not immediately available.

104,BK,U.S. judge takes $8.5 bln BofA deal from state court,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A judge on Wednesday decided to keep a proposed $8.5 billion settlement over Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) mortgage-backed securities in federal court, potentially dragging out the litigation. The stakes are high for Bank of America, which had hoped the agreement would resolve uncertainty over potential liabilities tied to pools of soured loans sold to investors by Countrywide Financial Corp, the mortgage lender it bought in 2008. Countrywide was the largest U.S. mortgage lender before being taken over by BofA, a disastrous purchase analysts say has effectively cost more than $30 billion after accounting for lawsuits and writedowns. Any delay in resolving the case will add to uncertainty about the bank and could result in a higher payout to the mortgage-backed securities investors. The proposed agreement also calls for Bank of America to improve its mortgage servicing practices, but lawyers for a class of homeowners argued the servicing changes called for would not be corrective. A number of investors objected to the proposed settlement, which Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), the trustee for the mortgage securities, presented to a state judge in June for approval. A hearing to consider approving the deal had been scheduled for November 17 in New York State Supreme Court. In Wednesday’s written ruling, U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan agreed with one objector, institutional investor Walnut Place, that the case belonged in federal court. “The settlement agreement at issue here implicates core federal interests in the integrity of nationally chartered banks and the vitality of national securities markets,” Pauley’s order said in part. “A controversy touching on these paramount federal interests should proceed in federal court.” The judge ordered the parties to appear in his court on November 3 to discuss management of the case. Among others who sought to block the accord is New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. He accused Bank of New York Mellon of fraud for misleading investors about its role and saying the accord provided benefits that put that bank in a conflict of interest. Danny Kanner, a spokesman for Schneiderman, had no immediate comment on Wednesday’s ruling. In response to the ruling, Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson said, “We believe there are compelling reasons why the agreement should receive judicial approval in the court with appropriate jurisdiction.” Bank of New York Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine had no immediate comment. A lawyer for Walnut Place could not immediately be reached for comment. In general, when complex financial litigation is removed to federal court from state court, it slows down the process, according to lawyers not involved in the case. “The judge is going to want to look through the case, he’s going to want to review what was filed in the state court, see new submissions and no doubt hear from counsel for the parties directly,” said Mark Rifkin, a lawyer with Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz LLP in New York. Last month, Pauley peppered lawyers for Bank of New York Mellon and Walnut Place with questions in the bid by Walnut for the case to be resolved under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005. CAFA requires big-money class actions to be supervised by a federal judge. The proposed settlement was filed in state court as a special proceeding known as Article 77 and not as a class action. Article 77 in state court usually covers family trust matters. The agreement covers 530 mortgage pools with $174 billion of unpaid principal balances. Walnut Place argued in court papers that negotiations between the trustee and investors were held in secret.

109,BK,Exclusive: Massachusetts fund may drop BNY Mellon on forex,"BOSTON (Reuters) - The $46 billion Massachusetts pension fund said it might drop Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) as its partner for foreign exchange trading, after accusing the company of overcharging the fund on trades. “We are testing the market to see what other options are available to us,” said Michael Trotsky, executive director of the Massachusetts public pension fund. “We want to see if we can do a better job.” The news underscores the pressure being put on the forex programs run by two of the world’s top custodian banks, BNY Mellon and Boston-based State Street Corp (STT.N). Several lawsuits by public pension funds have been filed against the two companies, which deny any wrongdoing. BNY Mellon has been the Massachusetts pension fund’s financial custodian since 2000 and has handled forex trading as part of that contract. Massachusetts is evaluating whether to separate the forex role from the custodian agreement. Trotsky said the pension fund plans to interview a number of candidates this month to replace BNY Mellon after issuing a request for proposals. He declined to name the candidates. He said a decision could be made before the fund’s December 6 board meeting. “We’re evaluating the responses,” Trotsky told Reuters during a telephone interview. BNY Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine declined to comment for this story. In June, Massachusetts Treasurer Steve Grossman said an audit showed BNY Mellon had overcharged the pension fund $30.5 million on forex trades since 2000. BNY Mellon has denied any wrongdoing. Forex trading is a lucrative franchise for BNY Mellon and State Street. At BNY Mellon, for example, forex accounted for $221 million, or 6 percent, of the company’s third-quarter revenue. During a conference call last week, BNY Mellon Chief Executive Gerald Hassell said the bank would not be “coerced into paying huge sums for no wrongdoing.” He also said the company had not seen any client attrition because of the forex controversy. Trotsky said the Massachusetts pension fund continues to be happy with BNY Mellon as its financial custodian. “They’re a good firm with that stuff,” Trotsky said. In fact, he said, he has told his team to keep a good relationship with BNY Mellon and not talk about forex issues.

110,BK,Wall St falls as euro-zone bond yields rise,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks fell on Monday as rising bond yields in Italy and other euro-zone countries reminded investors that despite changes in governments, the region’s debt crisis could still spin out of control. Banks posted the largest losses, but overall volume was unusually weak. The KBW bank index dropped 2.5 percent, with Bank of New York Mellon down more than 4 percent. The S&P; 500 found strong resistance after closing on Friday near its 200-day moving average and close to the top of a trading range the index has held for three months. Initial relief over the appointment of a technocrat to head the new government in Italy after the resignation of Silvio Berlusconi gave way to worries that unpopular austerity measures will not be enough to fix the country’s finances. For details see. Benchmark yields in Italy, France and Spain edged higher from the end of last week and closed near session highs. Rising bond yields are being watched carefully because every rise in interest rates threatens the ability of Italy and other countries to finance themselves. “That sign of a reversal of what had been a more favorable trend in Europe is what the (equities) market worried about today,” said Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston. “That has raised worries that European problems are not that much behind us.” Stocks have lately focused on headlines from Europe as traders react to the escalating sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone. Italian benchmark bond yields rose above 7 percent last week, a level that forced countries with a lower debt burden to seek bailouts. With debt of more than 2 trillion euros, Italy is considered too big to bail out. Yields on 10-year Italian debt rose to 6.76 percent on Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 74.70 points, or 0.61 percent, at 12,078.98. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 12.07 points, or 0.96 percent, at 1,251.78. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 21.53 points, or 0.80 percent, at 2,657.22. At 5.5 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, the third-lowest number so far this year and down more than 30 percent from the year’s daily average of just over 8 billion. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a ratio of 16 to 5, while on the Nasdaq, about three stocks fell for every one that rose. Stocks continued to track the euro, which fell more than 1 percent against the dollar. Adding to the gloom in the region, industrial production in the euro zone fell in September, the most since early 2009. Output at factories in the 17-nation group declined 2 percent for the month.

Italy’s debt in the credit default swap market rose to a record at the close of 569 basis points, up from 525 basis points on Friday, according to data provider Markit. This means it would cost 569,000 euros per year to insure 10 million euros of Italian debt for five years. French and Spanish CDs costs also rose to record highs, according to Markit.

111,BK,"UPDATE 2-BNY Mellon unveils cost cutting, Q4 profit hit","* BNY Mellon unveils cost-cutting program * CEO warns of sluggish economy, escalating legal costs * Stock down 4.5 pct Nov 14 (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp said it expects its fourth-quarter profit to be hit by an efficiency program to save up to $700 million, before taxes, by 2015. BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custody bank, detailed the plan on Monday as part of its investor day presentation. The bank estimated incremental expenses of $80 million to $100 million in the current quarter as it begins to roll out its cost-cutting program. The initiative includes shedding expensive real estate, consolidating some facilities, outsourcing some technology functions and taking more advantage of cloud computing. Analysts have been skeptical of the cost-cutting plans introduced by BNY Mellon and rival State Street Corp. In their research reports, they have worried some of the cost savings will not make it to the bottom line because the companies are constantly under pressure to spend money to update technology. BNY Mellon shares fell 4.5 percent to $20.54 on Monday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. The company’s stock is off about 26 percent over the past 12 months, underperforming the 15.4 percent decline on the Dow Jones U.S. Asset Managers Index BNY Mellon Chief Executive Gerald Hassell said his company is clearly operating in a sluggish global economy and that it faces higher regulatory and legal costs. Its foreign exchange business, for example, has been accused in lawsuits of overcharging public pension fund clients on non-negotiated trades. Hassell said he is open to reasonable resolutions as the bank adopts new program options for clients, but it will not be coerced into paying enormous sums to settle forex disputes. BNY Mellon did not announce any job cuts, but the bank plans to reduce high-cost real estate and consolidate locations. Other cost cuts will include automating more corporate actions in areas such as custody and accounting operations. In technology, the bank said it plans to reduce the number of desktop configurations by 90 percent while simplifying and standardizing its mainframe computing environments. BNY Mellon’s cost-cutting initiative comes about a year after Boston-based State Street Corp , the world’s No. 3 custody bank, unveiled its own plan, targeting information technology costs. State Street plans to save up to $625 million, before taxes, by the end of 2014. It also plans to record pre-tax restructuring charges between $400 million and $450 million over a four-year period. Billionaire investor Nelson Peltz’s Trian Group last month released a top-to-bottom critique of State Street, saying the company sacrificed profits for revenue growth, while allowing compensation expenses to balloon. Trian’s analysis also was critical of BNY Mellon and Northern Trust Securities Corp . “Like State Street, their problems have been largely self inflicted as the whole industry has been poorly managed in our view,” Trian said in its white paper analysis. It cited disappointing cost controls, poor capital allocation and lack of price discipline in their core custody business.",11142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/bnymellon-outlook/update-2-bny-mellon-unveils-cost-cutting-q4-profit-hit-idUSN1E7AD1GO20111114

114,BK,UPDATE 1-BNY Mellon scores partial forex legal victory,"* Judge dismisses 2 of 3 claims in Virginia forex lawsuit * Virginia voluntarily dropped a claim in the suit * State wants more than $900 mln in penalties, damages Nov 18 (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp said on Friday a state judge dismissed two of three of the remaining claims in a Virginia lawsuit seeking about $932 million in penalties and damages over foreign exchange trades executed for public pension plans in that state. But the Virginia Attorney General’s office said in a statement the central allegation in the case — that the bank violated the Fraud Against Taxpayers Act — remains intact. The case is still proceeding toward trial. In a bench ruling on Friday, Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Terrence Ney dismissed two types of false claim allegations, or theories, brought against BNY Mellon by Virginia Attorney General Kenneth Cuccinelli. The state voluntarily dropped another claim, while the remaining claim accuses BNY Mellon of creating false forex pricing reports. For BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custody bank, the ruling was significant. It was the first time a judge ruled on a false claim allegation in one of the forex lawsuits it is defending against. False claims statutes tend to be similar from state to state. “We are pleased that the court dismissed two of the three remaining claims brought by (Virginia) and we are gratified that the judge scheduled a prompt hearing on the one remaining claim,” BNY Mellon said in a statement. Cuccinelli’s office said in a statement the court unequivocally held the facts alleged were sufficient to allow the lawsuit to proceed. “There were three alternate theories of how the bank violated the law,” the statement said. “Two of the three theories were dismissed without prejudice, which means the commonwealth can refile them if it chooses. But the central claim ... remains.” In August, Cuccinelli filed a lawsuit against BNY Mellon on behalf of the $50 billion-plus Virginia Retirement System and other public pension plans. The complaint accused the world’s largest custody bank of charging undisclosed markups on standing-instruction forex trades. Standing-instruction trades executed by BNY Mellon and Boston-based State Street Corp have been the subject of several lawsuits filed against the banks by public pension plans around the United States. The trades, also called nonnegotiable trades, are typically for amounts less than $1 million. At a hearing set for Dec. 21, BNY Mellon will get another chance to challenge the remaining claim in the case, which accuses the bank of creating documents that showed false forex prices. Ney disagreed on Friday with BNY Mellon’s legal team that the statute was misapplied in the case.",11182011,http://www.reuters.com/article/bnymellon-forex/update-1-bny-mellon-scores-partial-forex-legal-victory-idUSN1E7AH1I620111118

117,BK,Bank of New York flinches on charging deposit fee,"* No client has been assessed the controversial fee * Surge of deposits still weigh balance sheet * Policy announced in August still in place-spokesman By Jed Horowitz Nov 25 (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp , which was derided for a plan to charge some of its large corporate and investment management clients for holding their deposits, appears to have flinched. The bank has not assessed a penny since warning clients about the possible deposit fee in early August, officials told Reuters, although it remains burdened by cash that it cannot profitably redeploy at rock-bottom interest rates. The fee of 0.13 percent was to have taken effect on Aug. 8 for accounts with more than $50 million that had soared well above their monthly averages as clients fled short-term investments for the safety of U.S. banks. “My guess is that the backlash was pretty stringent and they decided not to do it,” said William Gerber, chief financial officer of TD Ameritrade Holding Corp , a cash-management client of Bank of New York. “I can see their problem but I’m not that empathetic considering all the fees we’ve been waiving.” He was referring to hundreds of millions of dollars of money-market mutual fund fees that financial companies have waived over the past two years lest investors realize negative returns on their fund holdings. Unlike Bank of America, which was shamed into withdrawing a plan to charge its customers $5 for debit card transactions after a torrent of articles ridiculing the proposal, Bank of New York said that its super-sized version of its deposit fee is not dead. “We haven’t charged any clients to date, and the policy remains in place as markets remain unsettled and interest rates remain at historic lows,” BNY Mellon spokesman Ron Sommer wrote in an email. The fee, he added, was aimed at “a small number of clients with extraordinarily high and volatile deposit levels.” In its August letter, the bank urged clients to consider cash investment options “to minimize any effect” of the mooted fee. The plan was prompted by a flood of deposits from companies, money-market funds and other clients fleeing short-term investments that exposed them in late July to the then-unfolding Greek financial crisis and from U.S. government securities amid a Congressional impasse over raising the U.S. debt ceiling. A source said Bank of New York’s deposits swelled about 39 percent in a period of two weeks in late July and early August to about $250 billion, underscoring the fragility of the global financial system at any sign of panic and creating balance-sheet management challenges for the bank. At the end of September, deposits were 45 percent higher than a year earlier, Chief Financial Officer Todd Gibbons said in discussing third-quarter earnings, though he said the influx had stabilized since earlier in the quarter. Sommer declined to discuss the deposit levels. Bank of New York continues to attract a heavy flow of cash since it has higher ratings from Moody’s Investor Services than trust bank competitors such as State Street Corp and Northern Trust Corp , another official said. Those banks did not match Bank of New York’s deposit fee announcement, although some commercial banks with larger lending businesses that fund loans with deposits have been passing FDIC fees to some of their small-business customers. The policy was initiated under former Bank of New York Chief Executive Robert Kelly, who was ousted in early September and replaced by Gerald Hassell, a 30-plus-year veteran of Bank of New York who some insiders said was more sensitive to client relationships. Kelly took the top role when the New York bank combined in 2007 with Pittsburgh-based Mellon Financial Corp, which he led. “I believe they are backing away from the strategy, Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in an email. “Not certain if it is customer backlash or a rethinking of strategy under new CEO.” Custody banks make most of their money from holding securities and other assets for clients worldwide and ensuring that they are properly accounted for and exchanged when clients demand. Bank of New York swapped its 338 retail branches and small business banking businesses in 2006 for JPMorgan Chase & Co’s corporate trust business and $150 million in cash. The deal helped Bank of New York avoid some of the credit problems that continue to depress earnings of more traditional banks, but deprives it of the ability to negotiate on loans and other businesses in return for winning custody activities. Because rates are so low, many custody banks today are less eager to attract new business or are more aggressive about insisting that clients offset the low-return deposit business by using other services, said Anthony Carfang, head of Treasury Strategies, a Chicago-based consulting firm.",11252011,http://www.reuters.com/article/bankofnewyork-fee/bank-of-new-york-flinches-on-charging-deposit-fee-idUSN1E7AO1AI20111125

119,BK,Mass. drops BNY Mellon on some forex trades,"BOSTON (Reuters) - The $48 billion Massachusetts pension fund on Tuesday dropped Bank of New York Mellon as the manager on some of its foreign exchange trades after accusing the custody bank this summer of overcharging the fund $30.5 million on non-negotiated transactions. The Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Management Board voted to hire Russell Investments and estimated it could save $1.2 million a year by going with that company. The move In June Massachusetts Treasurer Steve Grossman made public an audit accusing BNY Mellon of overcharging the pension fund $30.5 million on forex trades since 2000. BNY Mellon has denied any wrongdoing. “We are confident we provide all of our institutional clients and their investment managers with highly competitive foreign exchange services,” the bank said in a statement. “We are disappointed to hear of PRIM’s decision.” The pension fund plans to use Russell primarily on private-equity distressed debt forex trades, whose volume totaled $290.3 million during the 12 months that ended September 30. Under BNY Mellon, those trades cost the fund $1.2 million. The fund estimates Russell could do those trades for $116,116, a savings of $1.1 million. The fund also said it could save another $182,648 using Russell on trades for some of its investment managers who can’t do forex on their own. Overall, Russell will execute trades in areas that account for about 5 percent of the pension fund’s total forex volume. Non-negotiated, or standing instruction forex trades, have sparked legal action across the country as public pension funds accuse BNY Mellon and Boston-based State Street Corp of failing to give competitive prices. In Massachusetts, for example, the state’s top securities regulator accused BNY Mellon of hiding big markups on non-negotiated forex trades. Meanwhile, the Massachusetts pension fund has told its investment managers to negotiate more forex trades to lower costs. In the third quarter, negotiated trades accounted for 84 percent of the fund’s forex volume, costing 1.19 basis points. In contrast, non-negotiated trades cost the fund 24.58 basis points in the third quarter. Those trades accounted for 16 percent of overall forex volume, down from 57.5 percent in the first quarter, according to the pension fund. The board said BNY Mellon’s non-negotiated forex costs still rank poorly compared with a peer index. An outside study of non-negotiated trades executed by BNY Mellon between January 2000 and May 2011 showed that they cost 33 basis points, putting the bank in the 8th percentile, according to an index put together by Boston-area firm FX Transparency. A second study covering May to September of this year showed that those costs dropped to 23.17 basis points, but BNY Mellon still compared poorly to peers, ranking in the 15th percentile, the pension fund said.

121,BK,BNY Mellon ending free ride for smaller clients,"(Reuters) - For Bank of New York Mellon Corp’s smaller clients, the free ride is coming to an end. Chief Executive Gerald Hassell said on Wednesday that the world’s largest custody bank is slowly introducing a pricing model that treats small institutional clients differently from large ones. Speaking at a Goldman Sachs financial services conference in New York, Hassell said BNY Mellon bank is working to unravel bundled services so smaller clients don’t get big-client treatment for free. “We want to make sure we get paid for those individual services and not simply bundle a variety of extra services that they happen to get for free,” Hassell said. “We are optimistic that we can really try to change the pricing paradigm of some of this business, because we just simply have to start getting paid for all of the services we deliver, and we can’t simply rely on capital markets activities for profitability,” he added. BNY Mellon outlined plans for a tiered pricing approach. Larger clients, such as big hedge funds, will continue to receive a high level of service and customization, while lower-tier clients receive a more standardized service with less customization. Previously, a significant number of the bank’s asset-servicing clients received the same treatment as BNY Mellon’s largest, most complex clients. But the bank was receiving less than $100,000 in revenue per year on some of those smaller accounts. BNY Mellon said it may introduce a higher minimum price for smaller clients and raise fees on selected larger clients who don’t meet the bank’s minimum profit threshold. The changes may result in a small amount of client attrition and possibly a modest decline in assets under custody, the bank has said. But Hassell is slashing costs and rejiggering customer pricing to improve margins that have been weighed down by low interest rates. Last month, the bank introduced a program to create up to $700 million in savings by 2015 through automation, improved business operations and consolidation of technology applications. Many Wall Street analysts applauded the size of the cost savings program, but some have said it points to a larger problem. “On the negative side, the magnitude of action required, in our opinion, is indicative of the burden of too many disparate businesses and too many systems that came from too many acquisitions over many years,” Stifel Nicolaus analyst Jeffrey Hopson wrote in a recent research note. “There is obvious execution risk in terms of client disruption, corporate distraction and extended time period for payback.” Hassell promised to return capital to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. He has said one of the best investments BNY Mellon can make is in its own stock, which is down 29 percent over the past 12 months. During that same period, the Dow Jones U.S. Asset Managers Index has dropped 17 percent, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has risen 2.5 percent. Mike Mayo, an analyst at Credit Agricole Securities, said even if BNY Mellon achieves its savings target, the bank isn’t showing as much benefit, given its scale, as it should. In a research note, Mayo said BNY Mellon and Boston-based State Street Corp have been battling a decline in aggregate asset-servicing fees. Those fees, he said, have declined as a percentage of total assets under custody over the past decade.

123,BK,BofA lawyer says settlement challenger is Baupost,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walnut Place, a group of undisclosed investors who oppose Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) $8.5 billion mortgage bond settlement, is the Baupost Group, a distressed debt fund, according to an attorney for the bank. “Walnut Place is actually a made up name,” Theodore Mirvis, an attorney with Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz who represents Bank of America, said at a hearing in New York state Supreme Court Thursday. The “real” firm, which sued Bank of America and Bank of New York Mellon BKNYK.UL, as trustee, over mortgage-backed securities trusts is Baupost — “known as a distressed debt or sometimes a vulture fund,” Mirvis said. Baupost spokeswoman Elaine Mann declined to comment on whether the Boston-based hedge fund was behind Walnut. David Grais, an attorney at Grais & Ellsworth LLP in New York who represents the Walnut entities, also declined to comment on whether Walnut was Baupost. Like most hedge funds, Baupost doesn’t usually disclose its earnings or investments, but was reported to have $23 billion in assets last year. Walnut Place is involved in separate cases against Bank of America. In August, 11 entities sharing the name Walnut Place filed to remove the global $8.5 billion settlement case from New York state to federal court, citing its size and complexity. The settlement was intended to resolve much of Bank of America’s remaining legal liability tied to its disastrous 2008 purchase of mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp. The deal, which was reached with over 20 institutional investors, would apply to other investors as well. The decision to remove the case to U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York is on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. Bank of New York Mellon is the trustee for the 530 mortgage securitization trusts covered by the proposed agreement. Mirvis and Grais were in state court Thursday, arguing on a motion by Bank of America to dismiss a separate case that the Walnut Place entities brought against Countrywide Home Loans for breaching the agreements governing two mortgage-backed securities trusts. Trustee Bank of New York Mellon is also a defendant. Mirvis argued the lawsuit should be dismissed because the right to sue for the repurchase of loans on representation and warranty claims belonged to the trustee. He told the judge that if she sides with Bank of America, “there’s no plan B for certificate holders.” Grais argues that holders of 25 percent of voting rights are authorized to bring cases when the trustee doesn’t want to. In a May court filing, Bank of America said that Baupost sent letters to the Bank of New York Mellon, claiming it was a certificate holder and that loans in two trusts did not comply with representations and warranties made by Countrywide Home Loans. They said appraisals were inflated and other information had been misrepresented. Baupost demanded the trustee give notice of the alleged breaches to Countrywide, according to the document, and require Countrywide to repurchase the loans. On December 21, 2010, the trustee received a letter concerning one of the trusts from entities including the “Walnut Place” entities. “The Walnut Place entities claimed to have been assigned Baupost’s interest in that trust,” the document said. The case in state court Thursday was Walnut Place LLC v. Countrywide Home Loans Inc, 650497/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). The federal case for the $8.5 billion proposed settlement is Bank of New York Mellon v. Walnut Place LLC, 11-cv-05988, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Mirvis argued the lawsuit should be dismissed because the right to sue for the repurchase of loans on representation and warranty claims belonged to the trustee. He told the judge that if she sides with Bank of America, “there’s no plan B for certificate holders.” Grais argues that holders of 25 percent of voting rights are authorized to bring cases when the trustee doesn’t want to. In a May court filing, Bank of America said that Baupost sent letters to the Bank of New York Mellon, claiming it was a certificate holder and that loans in two trusts did not comply with representations and warranties made by Countrywide Home Loans. They said appraisals were inflated and other information had been misrepresented. Baupost demanded the trustee give notice of the alleged breaches to Countrywide, according to the document, and require Countrywide to repurchase the loans. On Dec. 21, 2010, the trustee received a letter concerning one of the trusts from entities including the “Walnut Place” entities. “The Walnut Place entities claimed to have been assigned Baupost’s interest in that trust,” the document said. The case in state court Thursday was Walnut Place LLC v. Countrywide Home Loans Inc, 650497/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). The federal case for the $8.5 billion proposed settlement is Bank of New York Mellon v. Walnut Place LLC, 11-cv-05988, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

125,BK,Creditors challenge Jefferson County bankruptcy,"(Reuters) - Jefferson County, Alabama, has no legal grounds to be in municipal bankruptcy proceedings, the county’s creditors argued in a court filing on Friday. Bank of New York Mellon Corp, as the indenture trustee for the holders of county sewer warrants, asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Thomas Bennett to dismiss the bankruptcy case, claiming Jefferson County does not qualify for Chapter 9 relief under federal bankruptcy law. The county must be authorized under Alabama state law to file for federal bankruptcy protection, and it fails to meet those eligibility requirements, the bank argued. Under Alabama law, only municipalities that have outstanding bonds can file a Chapter 9 petition, the filing said. Jefferson County has no outstanding bonds, only warrants, and is therefore violating the “clear intent of the Alabama legislature,” the creditors argued. “In light of the County’s lack of funding or refunding bonds and the resulting failure of specific authorization to file its chapter 9 petition, the County’s chapter 9 petition must be dismissed,” Bank of New York Mellon said in its filing. Patrick Darby, a lawyer for Jefferson County, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jefferson County filed for bankruptcy protection on November 9 in the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. The county’s debt escalated in the mid-2000s when financing for a new sewer system soured amid widespread corruption and fraud charges. The case is In Re: Jefferson County, Alabama, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Alabama, No. 11-05736.

126,BK,Appeals court to review BofA $8.5 billion MBS pact,"(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court agreed to resolve a dispute among institutional investors over whether Bank of America Corp’s $8.5 billion mortgage debt settlement should be sent back to a New York state court for approval. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on Tuesday said it plans to rule within a 60-day period on whether U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan correctly took the case from the state court. It granted the requests of Bank of New York Mellon Corp, which as trustee negotiated the settlement, and investors including BlackRock Inc, MetLife Inc and Allianz SE’s Pimco to appeal Pauley’s decision. Other investors, led by a group called Walnut Place, preferred that the case stay in federal court, which could result in higher recoveries. The June settlement was intended to address much of Bank of America’s remaining legal liability from the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank’s 2008 purchase of mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp. It would cover claims by investors in 530 mortgage securitization trusts with $174 billion of unpaid principal that the home loans underlying their investments were toxic or underwritten poorly. Bank of New York Mellon had negotiated the accord with 22 institutional investors, and sought approval by New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick in Manhattan. But Walnut Place and other investors that were not part of the talks, but would be bound by the outcome, complained that the $8.5 billion payout was too low. Moving the case to federal court could make it easier for these investors to back out, or negotiate higher payouts. In a two-page order, the 2nd Circuit asked the parties to address several issues, including whether the settlement was a “mass action” allowing federal court review. “We have jurisdiction to determine our jurisdiction,” the 2nd Circuit said. Pauley had on October 19 said the case implicated “paramount federal interests” such as the integrity of nationally chartered banks and the vitality of financial markets. Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson declined to comment. Bank of New York Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine and David Grais, a lawyer for Walnut Place, did not immediately return calls. The 2nd Circuit also granted Bank of America’s request to file papers supporting requests for an appeal. The cases are Bank of New York Mellon v. Walnut Place LLC et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 11-4554 and 11-4571.

127,BK,Whistleblower documents illuminate case against BNY Mellon,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Confidential whistleblower documents that helped spark a massive state and federal investigation into how Bank of New York Mellon Corp charged pension funds for currency exchange, provide a rare window into how a bank insider aided a lawsuit against the bank. The information provided by whistleblower Grant Wilson, who worked at BNY Mellon, included a detailed analysis of how the bank allegedly provided “fictitious” foreign-currency costs for pension funds. The analysis included a step-by-step guide to how currencies were traded and internal profits generated by the bank, according to documents seen by Reuters. A memo detailing fellow employees also was provided. Aided by Wilson’s information, multiple states, including Virginia, Florida and New York, have sued BNY Mellon, alleging that the bank improperly charged state and local pension funds for foreign exchange. The Department of Justice also has sued the bank. The allegations center on claims that BNY Mellon provided unfavorable currency-exchange rates for state and local pension funds for a decade. In a lawsuit in October, the New York attorney general alleged BNY Mellon earned $2 billion over the decade from the trading. A bank spokesman said the bank believes that many comments detailed in the documents were taken out of context or not said at all. “A handful of purported statements cherry-picked from millions of documents gathered over a decade do not reflect the way we do business or the value we provide our client,” the spokesman said. The documents illuminate why insiders with highly confidential information can be a potent force in whistleblower lawsuits. Much of the information a whistleblower provides remains confidential. Wilson, for example, worked at the bank even as he secretly provided to his legal team — lawyers in Boston and New York — information about how BNY Mellon allegedly conducted foreign-exchange trading. Wilson’s information was provided to the legal team that filed whistleblower lawsuits against BNY Mellon in 2009 and then aided state attorneys general in subsequent probes. The legal team includes Boston lawyer Michael Lesser, and Philip Michael, a lawyer in New York, as well as Harry Markopolos, a fraud investigator best known for warning that Bernard Madoff was operating a fraudulent scheme. Lesser, an attorney at Thornton & Naumes, said Wilson was not available for a comment. The information then was provided by Wilson’s lawyers to the Florida attorney general in 2009 and 2010. The attorney general at the time was weighing whether to intervene in an October 2009 whistleblower lawsuit against BNY Mellon. That lawsuit was based on Wilson’s information. In August this year, Florida Attorney General Pamela Jo Bondi filed her lawsuit in Leon County. A bank spokesman said the Florida lawsuit is “without merit.” The Wall Street Journal earlier this year identified Wilson as the whistleblower behind the state and federal investigations and reported the existence of the documents. Wilson, according to the documents, worked as a foreign-exchange trader for 19 years. He joined a predecessor bank to BNY Mellon in 1997 and left this spring. He worked at BNY Mellon’s Pittsburgh office. The documents detail Wilson’s experience at the bank, noting that the trader “possesses deep and sophisticated knowledge and personal experience in these businesses, particularly with regard to foreign exchange.” The documents note that he “never received a reprimand” during his career. Wilson’s first-hand knowledge was crucial to the state lawsuits. Information provided in 2009 underpinned subsequent state claims. Wilson “can describe, step-by-step, how the fraud is committed against the affected funds and how the various departments of the Bank work to make the process as profitable as possible,” one document alleges. Wilson and his lawyers, for example, provide 11 chronological steps to explain how pension clients allegedly receive a “falsified trade price,” documents show. Those clients used a so-called “standing-instruction” program in which they effectively give control of foreign exchange to the bank. In one document, Wilson’s lawyers provide a question-and-answer tutorial so the Florida attorney general’s office knows the right questions to ask BNY Mellon employees. The documents also show how Wilson aided the legal effort even as he continued to work at BNY Mellon. One memo was written by Wilson’s lawyers in August 2010, some eight months before Wilson left the bank. In the memo, Wilson’s lawyers tell the Florida attorney general that Wilson knows that efforts to obtain documents from the bank are being stymied with “claims of difficulty in production or other delays.” The memo, using Wilson’s knowledge of the bank, states that the information actually could be easily obtained because it is “centrally stored.” “It is stored at a state-of-the-art facility that should hasten, rather than hinder, any document response from the bank.” A month later, in September 2010, Wilson’s lawyers submitted another memo to Florida’s attorney general, noting: “We would also like to remind you that (Wilson) continues in his employment at the bank. Specific information, documents and conversations mentioned here could be connected” to Wilson. That memo alleges that BNY Mellon “is now actively and hurriedly formulating a strategy” aimed at preserving profits from the foreign-exchange business at the center of the state inquiries. The memo explains that BNY Mellon publicly wants to provide a supposedly more “transparent” foreign-exchange system. Actually, the “Project Gateway” strategy provides “no true change,” the memo claims. The memo also claims that one BNY Mellon client had received better pricing on currency transactions even as the bank continued “to steal” from other clients. The documents also show some inside BNY Mellon allegedly worried about the impact of the investigations and whether profits would soon disappear. One employee, having learned that probes were looking at how BNY Mellon traded currencies, said: “It’s over, it’s all over,” according to a March 2010 document. Another document describes two months later how a senior banker addressed FX traders and told them the bank had received 16 subpoenas. This employee told the traders, “We have not done anything wrong.” In a seven-page memo, Wilson and his legal team provided detailed biographies of fellow traders and employees at BNY Mellon to help determine whether they might be helpful in the whistleblower legal effort. One employee was described as “worried about job security ... Not financially secure. Scared and probably loyal to the Bank. But also would not be inclined to perjure herself ... She has a lot of information.” Another senior executive “likes to rant and rave ... Mr. Wilson assumes he will want to defend the bank.” A sales executive “seems willing to push the envelope when it comes to producing profits.” ",12282011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bnymellon-whistleblower/whistleblower-documents-illuminate-case-against-bny-mellon-idUSTRE7BR0OZ20111228
128,BK,UK pension fund returns see first dip since 2008-data,"* UK pension fund returns negative for first time since 2008 * Allocations shift from UK equities to index-linked Gilts LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The average UK pension fund booked a negative annual return for the first time since 2008 last year, nudged into the red by a marked rise in stock market volatility caused by the euro zone crisis, an early survey of the industry showed on Thursday. Returns were minus 0.9 percent for the year, BNY Mellon  estimated, due to a negative return of 4.8 percent during the third quarter. All other quarters of the year saw slightly positive returns. “2011 was a very volatile year for assets of pension funds,” Alan Wilcock, performance and risk analytics manager at BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, said in a statement. This volatility is reflected starkly in emerging market and Europe ex-UK equities, which posted annual returns of minus 17.8 percent and minus 15.2 percent respectively. Allocations to UK equities reached an all-time low in 2011 of 19 percent, compared with 47.1 percent 10 years ago, BNY Mellon said. Despite recording an estimated average return of 8.4 percent a year since the financial crisis first erupted in 2008, Wilcock is cautious about the outlook. “Although returns were only slightly negative for the year as a whole, higher inflation and lower long-term interest rates will have added to pension scheme liabilities,” he said. Reflecting the heightened concern over the future path of inflation, UK pension funds almost tripled holdings of index-linked Gilts to 15 percent from 5.7 percent over a 10 year period. Safe-haven plays also saw fixed-income allocations rise to 29.5 percent from 18.5 percent, most significantly within non-Gilts, the survey shows. BNY Mellon will publish the full report at the end of March.",1052012,http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-pensions-bnymellon/uk-pension-fund-returns-see-first-dip-since-2008-data-idUSL6E8C52GT20120105
129,BK,MF Global's aborted fruit salad solution to capital woes,"(Reuters) - A few months before MF Global collapsed in bankruptcy, some top executives at the futures firm were talking about a plan code-named “Project Honeydew” as a way of freeing-up badly needed capital and cash. Reuters has learned that in early September, MF Global reached out to Bank of New York Mellon Corp to inquire whether the big custodial bank would be interested in entering into a joint venture for processing and clearing certain customer transactions, according to four people familiar with the situation. The idea was to effectively merge MF Global’s clearing operation with Bank of New York’s and to enable the futures firm to maintain less regulatory capital on its balance sheet, these people say. The negotiations were preliminary and did not advance far largely because Bank of New York did not seem particularly interested in the idea advanced by MF Global, sources say. By the time MF Global filed for bankruptcy on October 31, any talks with Bank of New York had long ended. Kevin Heine, a Bank of New York spokesman, said, “We don’t comment on market rumor or speculation.” A person close the company says the potential joint venture with Bank of New York was just one of several arrangements that companies were considering, and discussions about broadening their business relationship had been going on for many months. The fact MF Global officials were looking for a way to reduce its regulatory capital in early fall could indicate that some at the firm were aware it needed to take longer-term measures to bolster its balance sheet. “It was a great deal for MF Global, but not sure for Bank of New York,” said a former MF Global employee familiar with the idea. “I’m not sure what they would get out of it.” Indeed, the idea of establishing clearing joint venture with Bank of New York coincided with a demand from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority that MF Global boost its capital holdings to offset some of the risk associated with the firm’s big bet on European sovereign debt. Ultimately, it was margin calls from lenders that provided financing for MF Global’s gamble on sovereign debt of countries like Italy, Spain and Ireland that led to the firm’s collapse. MF Global’s bankers and trading partners required the firm to post more collateral on those transactions after Moody’s Investor Service downgraded its debt on October 24. A week later, MF Global filed for bankruptcy despite a last-ditch attempt to raise cash by selling off billions in securities to Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs Group and its futures brokerage arm to Interactive Brokers. A potential last-minute deal with Interactive Brokers fell apart when it was discovered that at least $600 million in customer money was missing at MF Global. More than two months later, federal authorities are still trying to figure out where that customer money, which was supposed to have been kept separate from the firm’s own money, may have gone. The potential joint venture with Bank of New York, according to people familiar with the situation, was consistent with former MF Global CEO Jon Corzine’s desire to transform the firm more into a trading firm than a brokerage. The name “Project Honeydew” is believed to be a play on the “Mellon” part of Bank of New York’s name. The code name was hatched by officials with MF Global and was just one of several potential strategic deals that investment bankers hired by the firm were brought in to consider. It’s not clear how active Corzine, the former New Jersey Governor and U.S. Senator, was in the Project Honeydew talks. The potential deal did not come up during his three days of testimony about the collapse of MF Global on Capitol Hill. A Corzine spokesman was not immediately available for comment. Bradley Abelow, MF Global’s former president and chief operating officer, in a filing in the firm’s bankruptcy proceeding, said the firm cleared and processed trades for its own customers and other small brokerage firms in the futures firm. Clearing is a backoffice operation in which a firm executes and settles trades and requires a firm to set aside capital in the event a trade goes array and one party needs to be made whole. MF Global reached out Bank of New York because the nation’s oldest bank cleared and processed some of the firm’s own trading in U.S. Treasuries. The majority of clearing and trade execution for MF Global’s proprietary trades were handled by JPMorgan Chase & Co, which also arranged a $1.2 billion line of credit for the futures firm. Reuters previously reported that JPMorgan agreed to process a last-ditch sale of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of securities to Goldman Sachs on October 27. But JPMorgan did not immediately forward the proceeds from that sale as it was expected to do, say sources.

130,BK,Custody banks net short-selling gains from EU crisis,"LONDON (Reuters) - A group of specialist banks are profiting from Europe’s financial crisis, thanks to a surge in demand for securities which allow traders to bet against bank stocks and government bonds. The so-called custody banks that administer securities, a normally unglamorous and low-margin business, include BNY Mellon, JP Morgan (JPM.N) and State Street (STT.N). The banks, as well as loan specialist Equilend, take a fee for linking lenders with surplus stock — typically pension funds — with borrowers such as hedge funds and banks, who want to position themselves in markets by short-selling. Pension funds and insurers have become increasingly attracted to lending by the fees they accrue from the borrowers at a time when equity returns are off. The latter want stocks or bonds to sell them in the hope that their price will fall over time. They can then buy back the securities at a lower rate and pocket the difference before returning them to the lender. “There were many trading opportunities in 2011,” said James Slater, global head of securities lending at BNY Mellon. “Activity in the second half was driven by (hedge) funds, reacting to global events like the euro zone crisis.” JP Morgan and State Street both saw lending levels rise in 2011, while Equilend, whose electronic systems match firms wanting to lend with prospective borrowers, saw its trading levels spike in August. “Clearly volatility is a part of that but we’ve added more new clients this year than any other and they are using more of our services,” said Equilend Chief Executive Brian Lamb. The peak activity in August, when Equilend trading hit 27,770 loans worth $21.3 billion in one day, was partly driven by the worsening Euro zone crisis, during which traders borrowed assets to bet on falling markets. Equilend is owned by 10 large financial firms including Credit Suisse MLPN.P, Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and UBS UBSN.VX, custodians Northern Trust (NTRS.O) and State Street, and fund manager Blackrock. The world’s top stock lending houses may have ended 2011 up on previous years but sustained volatility and a drop in demand towards the end of the year have raised questions over the outlook for 2012. Lending rates in the latter part of the year were also affected by bans on the short-selling of some European bank stocks, which were introduced in August and still hold. “The extreme volatility in equity markets coupled with the continuation of short sell bans across many European countries contributed to a decrease in trading opportunities for much of the second half of the year,” said Don D’Eramo, senior managing director, securities finance, EMEA, at State Street. Some volatility tends to help boost trading and stock lending in the short-term but prolonged volatility breeds uncertainty which depresses the markets and, therefore, the ability to make money short-selling. “I suspect 2012 is going to remain challenging, without a speedy resolution to the Euro zone situation and a generally more positive market outlook,” said Paul Wilson, global head of client management and sales at JP Morgan Worldwide Securities Services. But the stock lending agents could benefit from regulatory efforts to force over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trading to go via clearing houses, known as central counterparties (CCPs), in order to improve transparency. Cash-strapped banks and brokers are already struggling for collateral to support their trading units and this situation will be compounded when regulators start to demand extra collateral from banks trading in the lucrative OTC markets. “(This) will increase the demand from trading firms and other derivative users for eligible collateral,” said JP Morgan’s Wilson. “Derivatives users will look to borrow credit-worthy fixed income securities.” ",1102012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-lending-eurozone/custody-banks-net-short-selling-gains-from-eu-crisis-idUSTRE8090VK20120110
131,BK,"Bank of NY Mellon, U.S. propose forex case settlement","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors and the Bank of New York Mellon Corp have reached a partial settlement over civil fraud charges brought by the government last year accusing the bank of overcharging clients for trading currencies, according to court documents filed on Tuesday. Under the settlement, the two sides said, the bank would disclose how it determines prices for certain transactions. There was no mention of a monetary settlement, but the court documents said the parties were continuing discussions. The settlement comes three months after Manhattan federal prosecutors and New York state’s attorney general filed separate lawsuits on the same day, increasing pressure on the bank after years-long investigations into whether banks were charging too much for foreign exchange transactions. On Tuesday, the bank and federal prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan to approve the partial settlement. The judge granted the government’s request to file an amended complaint in the next 30 days. The bank, which initially said it would fight the lawsuits, said on Tuesday that it had had “a constructive dialogue” with prosecutors. “While we are confident that we have provided our clients and their investment managers with the information needed to make informed trading decisions, this agreement addresses disclosure questions raised by the U.S. Attorney and is consistent with our ongoing commitment to implement enhancements that will benefit our clients,” Bank of New York Mellon Corp spokesman Kevin Heine said in a statement. A spokeswoman for the office of the Manhattan U.S. Attorney declined immediate comment on the proposed settlement. A similar suit filed by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman against Bank of New York Mellon over allegations the bank defrauded clients in foreign currency transactions is still pending in New York state Supreme Court in Manhattan.

132,BK,Judge's order could force Pittsburgh protesters to move,"PITTSBURGH (Reuters) - A Pennsylvania judge on Thursday issued an order that could force the anti-Wall Street protesters in Pittsburgh to leave the Mellon Square property they have inhabited since October. The order by Allegheny County Judge Christine Ward gives protesters three days to clear out once BNY Mellon, which owns the park, files a $10,000 bond with the court. “There is no zoning, constitutional, statutory or common law ground that permits a group of people to take over someone else’s private property as taken over BNY Mellon’s property here, and effectively prevent the owner from closing its property,” the judge’s order read. The judge noted that BNY Mellon does not pay for snow or ice removal at the park and Occupy Pittsburgh’s presence “creates liability exposure” even though the protesters have agreed to remove snow and ice themselves. Similar protests against social and economic inequality in other U.S. cities have been shut down by police, although protesters in the nation’s capital are still battling efforts to force them to leave two parks where they have lived for months. Inspired by the Arab Spring protests in the Middle East, Occupy Wall Street began when protesters set up camp in New York in September, sparking demonstrations across the United States and elsewhere in the world and, in a few cases, violent clashes with police. But evictions in various U.S. cities in November and December has made the protests less visible. In Pittsburgh, a spokeswoman for BNY Mellon, Lane Cigna, said: “We’re pleased with the judge’s ruling.” She did not indicate when the bond might be filed. BNY Mellon has argued that Occupy Pittsburgh’s presence causes “irreparable harm” and has cost the investment bank as much as $100,000 in property damages. Torry Seeley, 38, representing Occupy Pittsburgh, said the group had no comment on the judge’s order. Some 30 tents are set up at Mellon Park, where members of the Occupy Pittsburgh movement have camped since October. Occupy Pittsburgh members say 10 to 15 people stay there every night. “To me it’s more about what we do rather than whether or not we’re set up at this camp,” said Bud Ferguson, a 21-year-old protester. Protesters said they are upset that billions of dollars in bailouts given to banks during the recession allowed a return to huge profits while average Americans have had no relief from high unemployment and a struggling economy. An attorney for the group, Marvin Fein, said the judge’s order was unexpected. “I’m very disappointed in it,” he said. “To force Occupy out, Mellon needed to prove that we had produced irreparable harm and I think they failed to do that.” ",2032012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-protests-pittsburgh/judges-order-could-force-pittsburgh-protesters-to-move-idUSTRE81200920120203

134,BK,U.S. SEC presses BNY Mellon for better disclosure,"BOSTON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators have asked Bank of New York Mellon Corp to improve the data it provides in its financial disclosures. After a months-long review, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission asked the bank to improve disclosures on a number of items, including risk factors described as too vague, litigation reserves and profit per share data on the bank’s peer group. The SEC made the recommendations public over the past two weeks. One area the SEC’s corporate finance division revisited was a claim by BNY Mellon in its 2010 proxy that its earnings per share growth “was ahead of our peers.” But in the same sentence, the bank conceded its compensation committee determined the growth “was not meaningful” because the company lost money in 2009. David Larcker, a Stanford University accounting professor and corporate governance expert, said growth rate computations  using a negative base number are always problematic. “To their credit, they acknowledge that this is not a meaningful number,” Larcker said. Most of the companies in BNY Mellon’s 12-member peer group made money in 2009 and showed strong profit growth in 2010, according to their financial statements. BNY Mellon said its compensation committee did not use the claims to determine executive pay. BNY Mellon is the world’s largest custody bank, with $26 trillion in assets under custody and administration. It is not alone in being asked to provide more or better disclosure. The SEC has also asked insurer American International Group Inc to disclose more in its quarterly reports. It was the SEC’s second request for such changes from AIG in less than a year. BNY Mellon said it would provide more information to investors on most items in its financial reports and proxy statements. But the bank resisted the SEC’s suggestion that it include profit data from its peers. “We do not believe it is necessary or appropriate to include earnings per share information for our peers in our proxy statement in order for shareholders to understand the bonus determinations made by the (compensation committee),” BNY Mellon said in a Nov. 22 letter to the SEC. BNY Mellon said it would disclose its percentile ranking among peers in its latest proxy, due next month. It also said investors could find the performance of its peers by reading publicly available filings from those companies. In 2010, those filings would not have supported the proxy claim of peer-beating profits. For example, earnings at BlackRock Inc more than doubled in 2010. And at banks JPMorgan Chase & Co, U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo & Co, year-over-year earnings growth in 2010 was 48 percent, 50 percent and 21 percent, respectively. Citigroup, which posted a $1.6 billion loss in 2009, showed more improvement in 2010 than BNY Mellon when it reported net income of $10.6 billion, a $12.2 billion swing. That context was missing in BNY Mellon’s proxy for 2010, according to the SEC, leading to the push from the agency for the bank to provide more peer data in its proxy. With 50 percent of executive bonuses based on a corporate component, the SEC wanted BNY Mellon to provide a clearer link on how these incentives were determined.",2162012,http://www.reuters.com/article/bnymellon-sec/u-s-sec-presses-bny-mellon-for-better-disclosure-idUSL2E8DGBTP20120216
135,BK,TEXT-Fitch rates CKI's USD 300 million hybrid securities 'BBB',"Feb 22 - Fitch Ratings has assigned a ‘BBB’ rating to the USD300million fixed-rate callable perpetual securities issued by Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM, ‘AA-‘/Stable/‘F1+’) on a fiduciary basis on behalf of Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Limited (CKI, ‘A-‘/Stable).  The hybrid securities are rated two notches below CKI’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR). BNYM, as the fiduciary, will use the proceeds from the issue of hybrid 	 securities to purchase new shares of CKI. Fitch believes that CKI may use the 	 proceeds from issue of shares for refinancing of existing debt and/or to pursue 	 investment opportunities. The hybrid securities are effectively subordinated as CKI’s obligations under 	 the swap agreement with BNYM are subordinated to CKI’s other obligations except 	 parity securities (including its existing USD1bn hybrid securities) and any 	 junior securities (currently share capital). Coupon payments on the hybrid 	 securities, which is the responsibility of CKI under the swap agreement with 	 BNYM, are deferrable at management’s discretion if no distributions on parity or 	 junior securities have been made in the three months prior to coupon payment 	 dates. No distributions can be made on parity or junior securities until 	 deferred coupons are paid. Deferred coupons are cumulative and accrue interest. 	 This three-month look back negates any equity credit. Thus, in its analysis, 	 Fitch will treat the hybrid’s principal and coupon payments as 100% debt. The rating of the hybrid securities at two notches below CKI’s IDR is based on 	 standard loss absorption provisions and in accordance with Fitch’s ‘Treatment 	 and Notching of Hybrids in Non-financial Corporates and REIT Analysis’ criteria 	 dated 15 December 2011.

136,BK,UPDATE 3-State Street says N.Y. authorities probing forex,"* At issue: non-negotiated trades * Trading practice a major source of State St revenue * Shares up less than 1 percent By Tim McLaughlin Feb 27 (Reuters) - U.S. and New York state prosecutors are investigating State Street Corp’s foreign exchange trades, the bank said on Monday, potentially putting more pressure on a major source of revenue for the company. State Street shares were up slightly on Monday, but they are down 10 percent over the past year, as State Street and rival Bank of New York Mellon Corp have been hit by lawsuits accusing them of improperly charging pension funds for foreign exchange. The New York state attorney general and the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York have made inquiries into what State Street described as “our indirect foreign exchange execution methods.” Those same New York authorities last year filed civil lawsuits against BNY Mellon, State Street’s top rival. In a lawsuit in October, the New York attorney general alleged BNY Mellon earned $2 billion over the decade from the trading. Earlier this month, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan filed an amended complaint against BNY Mellon that said the bank “repeatedly lied” about its forex transactions. The bank has denied any wrongdoing. Boston-based State Street, which is the largest provider of mutual fund custody and accounting services in the United States, made the disclosure about the New York investigation in its annual report filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. At issue are the prices custody banks have charged on so-called non-negotiated trades, typically on forex transactions that are less than $1 million. Pension funds and U.S. authorities have accused the custody banks of misrepresenting the pricing on the trades. The banks have denied any wrongdoing, but they also have changed their practices. State Street’s revenue from non-negotiated trades in 2011 dropped 1 percent year-over-year to about $331 million. That compares with total forex revenue of $683 million, which was an increase of 14 percent over the year before. Electronic forex trading is not included in those figures. In its annual report, State Street said heightened regulatory and media scrutiny of these forex trades could result in pressure on pricing and reduce client volume. “Some custody clients or their investment managers have elected to change the manner in which they execute foreign exchange with us or have decided not to use our foreign exchange execution methods,” State Street said in the filing. In 2009, California’s attorney general accused State Street of making false claims on its forex trading. The attorney general in that case has asserted actual damages of $56 million for the period from 2001 to 2009. It also is seeking additional penalties and damages. Meanwhile, Bernstein Research analyst Brad Hintz said State Street has struggled to pass along price increases to clients throughout its business segments. “The firm continues to face questions from investors who are at a loss to square the seeming oligopolistic structure of the industry with a lack of individual firm control over pricing,” Hintz said in a research note. “State Street continues to express a cautious view about the ability of industry participants to exercise pricing power.”",2272012,http://www.reuters.com/article/statestreet/update-3-state-street-says-n-y-authorities-probing-forex-idUSL2E8DR3V520120227
137,BK,State Street says N.Y. authorities probing forex,"(Reuters) - State Street Corp. said on Monday the U.S. attorney in Manhattan and the New York attorney general are investigating its foreign exchange trades, a development that could put more pressure on a key activity already under scrutiny.

138,BK,"Analysis:Despite crunch, BNY Mellon is a stock-option contrarian","BOSTON (Reuters) - BNY Mellon Corp (BK.N) is sticking with employee stock options, even as many major U.S. banks cut them, and despite its previous awards losing more than $850 million in value since 2008. Since the height of the credit crisis, U.S. banks have reduced or stopped issuing stock options to employees in favor of so-called restricted stock shares. Like options, the shares cannot be cashed in for several years, but employees can pocket some gains from them even if the stock price falls. But BNY Mellon is betting options will encourage executives and employees to work hard and be rewarded if its stock price rises. Still, experts say BNY’s contrarian stance could expose the world’s largest custody bank to staff departures because executives and rank-and-file employees are more likely to jump ship if the company’s stock remains mired at about $22. BNY shares peaked at almost $50 in December 2007. “This has a very demoralizing effect on employees,” said Purdue University professor Ben Dunford, who has studied the impact of underwater stock options on morale. Competitors that switch to restricted stock could gain an advantage over the bank. “There’s not a lot of appetite for options right now,” said Alan Johnson, a top Wall Street pay consultant. “The regulators hate them because they say they encourage excessive risk taking.” BNY employs 48,700 people worldwide and at least two-thirds of their 60.2 million in exercisable stock options were deeply underwater at the end of 2011. About 40 million of the options will expire worthless unless BNY Mellon’s share price hits $31, an increase of about 38 percent from the current $22.49. A group of 10 major U.S. banks and asset managers, including BNY, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co Inc (JPM.N) and State Street Corp (STT.N), issued 66 percent fewer options in 2011 than in 2007, according to an analysis of regulatory filings. Employees of the 10 firms have lost nearly $9 billion in paper profits on their options since 2007, according to annual reports. BNY Mellon was the only company in the group to issue more in 2011 than 2007, granting 8.74 million options compared with 8 million four years earlier. New York-based BNY Mellon declined to comment. State Street, BNY Mellon’s archrival, stopped issuing stock options several years ago and leans heavily on restricted stock in what has become the preferred strategy for many banks. But BNY’s contrarian attitude may yet prove be the right one because it is awarding options when its share price is depressed, Johnson says. Other banks rely too much on restricted stock and should be awarding more options. “I’ve been saying that now for two or three years, but on deaf ears,” Johnson added. In its most recent proxy filing discussing executive compensation, BNY Mellon said it reviewed its pay plans to avoid encouraging excessive risk taking. As a result, the bank added some risk-related controls on compensation, such as tying bonuses and restricted stock awards to reaching certain capital levels. Options can produce big gains for employees when a company’s stock price rises. They lose all of their value, however, if the stock falls below the price at the time of the award. Restricted stock continues to grow in popularity at the expense of the “much-maligned stock option,” Hofstra University professor Steven Petra and St. John’s University professor Nina Dorata wrote last month in the Journal of Accountancy. Under current accounting rules, restricted stock reduces corporate income less than options. It also is less dilutive to shareholders because they achieve their goal with fewer shares, they said. BNY Mellon also issues restricted stock, but options remain important. Last month, for example, Chairman and Chief Executive Gerald Hassell received 434,412 options, or 53 percent more than he received in restricted stock, U.S. regulatory filings show. Even though the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has more than doubled since the stock market’s nadir in early March 2009, the financial sector has lagged far behind and most bank-issued options remain underwater. Tens of millions of options have been canceled or forfeited over the past three years as they expired out of the money. After the dot-com bust, many tech companies repriced their options to keep their talent. But accounting rule changes, such as mandatory expensing along with stricter corporate governance, have made repricing more difficult. The total intrinsic value of BNY Mellon’s outstanding employee stock options, or the paper profits from all in-the-money options, was just $22 million in 2011, down from $875 million in 2007. Over the past two years, 28.5 million of these employee options have been canceled. That happened largely because BNY Mellon’s stock price was below the exercise price when they expired. Options are also canceled if an employee leaves before the vesting date.

Goldman Sachs’ research note also said first-quarter earnings at BNY Mellon, State Street and Northern Trust Corp (NTRS.O) are at risk of falling below consensus estimates because of the forex declines. “Two-thirds of the way through (the first quarter), we see risks to consensus EPS estimates for all three trust banks,” Goldman Sachs analyst Alexander Blostein said in the note.

147,BK,UPDATE 1-N.C. sues BNY for $95 mln Lehman investment,"* North Carolina pension funds had exposure to Lehman * Lawsuit claims BNY exec joked about Lehman’s shaky footing * $95 million investment lost most of its value March 15 (Reuters) - North Carolina officials on Thursday accused Bank of New York Mellon Corp of making an unauthorized $95 million investment in Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc for the state and joking about the investment bank’s precarious footing just days before it collapsed. The lawsuit, filed in North Carolina’s General Court of Justice, accuses BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custody bank, of making the investment in December 2006 on behalf of state employees’ retirement funds. “Instead of taking action to protect the state or any other securities lending clients by selling Lehman notes, which were still trading at high value,” the lawsuit said, “an executive of (BNY Mellon) stated, ‘My fingers are permanently crossed at this point ... don’t quit going to church!!!’” BNY Mellon denied any wrongdoing. “We believe the suit is without merit, and we will defend ourselves vigorously,” a BNY Mellon spokesman said. The value of the investment for the North Carolina pension funds plunged by about $70 million after Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection in September 2008. The North Carolina treasurer, who filed the lawsuit, said the Lehman investment had a maturity in excess of two years and less than three years, but was rated below the “AA” level that the state required for such an investment. The securities lending program was supposed to be a low-risk way for the pension funds to earn fees to offset some of their back-office costs. The lawsuit said BNY Mellon had invested more than $2 billion in Lehman notes for itself and clients. “If it started selling Lehman notes as a prudent fiduciary would in light of Lehman’s financial condition, that might cause a run on Lehman, and thus it had a conflict of interest,” the lawsuit said.

149,BK,BNY Mellon readies defense of $900 million tax benefit,"(Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp, already under pressure from several state pension fund clients over its forex practices, is preparing to battle the U.S. government over a tax benefit worth roughly a third of what the bank earned last year. The benefit stems from a $1.5 billion loan from Barclays PLC, which also helped several other U.S. banks generate billions of dollars in tax credits with cheap funding — so cheap, in fact, that at one point Barclays actually paid BNY Mellon to take Barclays’ money. The banks declined to comment. BNY Mellon’s petition against the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, though, provides an inside look at how several U.S. banks capitalized on the loans from Barclays. The U.S. bank has said the tax treatment on the funding was consistent with statutory and judicial authority. The banks in question used foreign credits to lower their U.S. tax bills by several hundred million dollars each. What the banks call a legal funding strategy, though, lawyers for the IRS call sham tax shelters. On April 16, BNY Mellon will square off against the IRS in U.S. Tax Court. The stakes are high, as the world’s largest custody bank fights to preserve a tax benefit estimated at $900 million. It will also be the first case to go to trial since the IRS accused several U.S. banks of generating artificial foreign tax credits through loans with London-based Barclays. Experts for the government have pounced on the fact that Barclays sometimes paid the other banks to take its money. “It not only defies economic theory but common knowledge that banks do not pay borrowers to take their money,” said Michael Cragg, chief operating officer of Brattle Group, a global economic consulting firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Cragg’s comments appeared in a declaration to a federal court in Minnesota, where Wells Fargo & Co is fighting to recover $162 million from the U.S. government. Cragg has provided testimony for the government. KPMG LLP, which received millions of dollars in fees in connection with the Barclays financing, declined to comment. The financing Barclays provided the U.S. banks centered on so-called STARS transactions - or structured trust advantaged repackaged securities. The arrangements are so opaque and complicated that a Harvard-trained federal judge in Minnesota had to call in an outside expert to help him decipher Wells Fargo’s arrangement with Barclays. Each of the banks say the loans from Barclays advanced its core business, according to court papers. Barclays offered them the opportunity to earn greater profits by providing an ultra-cheap source of funding. Any profit would be the difference between their cost of funding and what they earned on the money they invested or put out in loans. Barclays has not been accused of any wrongdoing in the tax cases. Foreign tax credits are used regularly by U.S. corporations to prevent double taxation on their overseas activities. But if BNY Mellon had to change its stance on the tax benefit generated from the Barclays loan, that could lead to a big reduction in 2012 profit. The bank already has warned investors it is “reasonably possible” that its reserve for uncertain tax positions could increase this year by a net amount of up to $850 million, according to U.S. regulatory filings. In 2011 the bank earned about $2.5 billion. Over the past decade, New York-based BNY Mellon, North Carolina’s BB&T; Corp, Wells and Sovereign Bank, a unit of Spain’s Banco Santander SA, collectively borrowed more than $5 billion from Barclays. The U.S. banks paid below-market interest rates on the money, which then was subject to a complicated series of transactions. Barclays gave BNY Mellon, for example, a five-year loan charging an interest rate about 360 basis points below the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, court papers show. This arrangement was similar to what was offered to other banks, according to people familiar with the transactions. But in 2001 and 2002, LIBOR was so low that the BNY Mellon loan generated negative interest. That meant Barclays paid BNY Mellon $63.3 million instead of charging interest during those two years, according to Tax Court documents. BNY Mellon said it paid more in total worldwide taxes because it accrued less interest expense, thanks to the Barclays financing. The cheap financing saved BNY Mellon at least $54 million in interest expense each year the Barclays loan was outstanding, BNY Mellon explained in its petition. Less interest expense expanded profit, boosting taxable income overseas. The bank, for example, said it paid about $200 million in United Kingdom taxes during a two-year stretch at a rate of 22 percent. The bank then claimed foreign tax credits to offset its U.S. tax liability. But several years later the IRS declared a $1 billion reduction in BNY Mellon’s foreign source income, undercutting the bank’s argument to offset U.S. tax liability. In 2009, the IRS served the bank and several of its peers with income tax deficiency notices. Barclays’ loans to American banks were structured to give it UK tax benefits. BNY Mellon says UK tax authorities reviewed its transactions with Barclays, according to court records. The fight with the IRS is the latest legal headache for the bank. Last week the state of North Carolina accused BNY Mellon of making unauthorized investments in Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. A few days prior, the state of Ohio joined several other states in alleging that the bank overcharged on foreign currency trades.

BNY Mellon and State Street, which had been appointed as custodians to hold approximately $41 billion for Ohio public-pension funds, would be replaced by JP Morgan Chase Bank NA and Citibank NA, Ohio state Treasurer Josh Mandel announced. Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine filed a $16 million lawsuit against BNY Mellon on March 12, accusing the bank of overcharging it for foreign currency exchange transactions.

Last year, Mandel requested an investigation by the attorney general into whether international custodians - which hold securities, stocks, bonds and other investments for pension funds, and conduct financial transactions on their behalf - were overcharging Ohio funds for currency exchange transactions. State Street said the state “remains a valuable client” and would not otherwise comment on its relationship with Ohio.

151,BK,Oregon funds to lead Bank of NY Mellon forex cases,"(Reuters) - Two Oregon pension funds will lead shareholder litigation accusing Bank of New York Mellon Corp of overcharging clients on foreign currency exchange transactions. The largest U.S. custodial bank has faced a variety of lawsuits as well as state and federal probes arising from allegations it set unfavorable prices on the transactions, allowing it to profit at the expense of state and local pension funds. Shareholders claimed that Bank of New York Mellon misled them about the sustainability and profitability of its foreign exchange trading activity, and that its share price fell as news about the alleged deceptive practices became known. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan on Thursday named Oregon’s treasurer, acting on behalf of the Common School Fund, and the Oregon Public Employee Retirement Board as lead plaintiffs in the case. He also named the law firm Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann as lead counsel for the plaintiffs. The shareholders are seeking class-action status on behalf of purchasers of Bank of New York Mellon shares between February 28, 2008 and August 11, 2011. The share price fell by roughly 56 percent over this period. Kevin Heine, a bank spokesman, declined to comment on Thursday’s order. The bank has previously said the shareholders’ claims have no merit. Gerald Silk, a lawyer for the lead plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Custodial banks provide back-office and other services including accounting, currency trading, portfolio servicing, stock lending, and valuing assets. In January, Bank of New York Mellon reached a partial settlement with the Justice Department of civil fraud charges related to how much it charged clients on currency trades.

152,BK,Oregon funds to lead Bank of NY Mellon forex cases,"* Clients said to be overcharged on currency transactions * Practices said to inflate bank’s stock price * Bank has said shareholder claims lack merit March 29 (Reuters) - Two Oregon pension funds will lead shareholder litigation accusing Bank of New York Mellon Corp  of overcharging clients on foreign currency exchange transactions. The largest U.S. custodial bank has faced a variety of lawsuits as well as state and federal probes arising from allegations it set unfavorable prices on the transactions, allowing it to profit at the expense of state and local pension funds. Shareholders claimed that Bank of New York Mellon misled them about the sustainability and profitability of its foreign exchange trading activity, and that its share price fell as news about the alleged deceptive practices became known. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan on Thursday named Oregon’s treasurer, acting on behalf of the Common School Fund, and the Oregon Public Employee Retirement Board as lead plaintiffs in the case. He also named the law firm Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann as lead counsel for the plaintiffs. The shareholders are seeking class-action status on behalf of purchasers of Bank of New York Mellon shares between Feb. 28, 2008 and Aug. 11, 2011. The share price fell by roughly 56 percent over this period. Kevin Heine, a bank spokesman, declined to comment on Thursday’s order. The bank has previously said the shareholders’ claims have no merit. Gerald Silk, a lawyer for the lead plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Custodial banks provide back-office and other services including accounting, currency trading, portfolio servicing, stock lending, and valuing assets. In January, Bank of New York Mellon reached a partial settlement with the Justice Department of civil fraud charges related to how much it charged clients on currency trades. No agreement had been reached on civil penalties.. Other large custodial banks including JPMorgan Chase & CO , State Street Corp and Northern Trust Corp .

154,BK,Forex lawsuit against BNY Mellon partly dismissed,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday dismissed five out of nine claims against Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N) over its foreign exchange pricing practices, and shipped off four remaining claims to be tried in different state courts, according to a ruling. U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco gave the plaintiffs 21 days to file an amended lawsuit that attempts to address the deficiencies he found in their complaint. Legal battles have raged for several years over claims that custodial banks, mainly BNY Mellon and State Street (STT.N), routinely overcharged pension funds and other institutional clients on currency transactions. State Street was sued in October 2009 by the California attorney general over its foreign-exchange practices. Last August, state officials in Florida and Virginia sued BNY Mellon, joining whistleblower lawsuits originally filed by the group FX Analytics. Along with several pension funds, FX Analytics is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit before Alsup. The judge dismissed allegations that BNY Mellon violated California’s False Claims Act, and he transferred additional allegations brought by the funds to state court. Attorneys for both sets of plaintiffs could not immediately be reached on Friday. BNY Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine on Friday said the ruling has essentially reduced the lawsuit to a basic breach of contract case. The bank will “vigorously defend” the remaining claims, he said. “We are pleased that this respected federal court has vindicated our position and dismissed the most serious claims against us,” Heine said. BNY Mellon reached a partial settlement with U.S. prosecutors in January over civil fraud charges brought by the government. Under the settlement, the two sides said, the bank would disclose how it determines prices for certain transactions. There was no mention of a monetary settlement, but the court documents said the parties were continuing discussions. The government sought hundreds of millions of dollars in civil penalties. In his ruling on Friday, Alsup ruled that monthly reports reflecting fictitious trades for FX rates were not the same as false claims for payment. Thus the plaintiffs could not allege False Claims Act violations based on those reports, he ruled. The case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California is In re Bank of New York Mellon Corporation False Claims Act Foreign Exchange Litigation, 11-5683.

155,BK,Bank of NY Mellon must face lawsuit on Countrywide,"(Reuters) - A federal judge rejected Bank of New York Mellon Corp’s bid to dismiss a lawsuit by investors over its role as trustee for mortgage-backed securities that led to an $8.5 billion settlement by Bank of America Corp. U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan said on Tuesday that bondholders who invested in 26 trusts alleged to have contained risky mortgage loans from the former Countrywide Financial Corp may pursue claims against Bank of New York Mellon. He dismissed a variety of other claims. The decision relates to a lawsuit challenging Bank of New York Mellon’s performance of its day-to-day obligations as a trustee, which includes ensuring that underlying home loans are properly documented and that bondholders’ rights are protected. Beth Kaswan, a lawyer for four pension funds in Chicago, Michigan and Pennsylvania that brought the case, said the decision leaves intact claims over securities backed by more than $30 billion of loans, and which have suffered more than $9 billion of losses or delinquencies. She said she believes the decision is the first to let investors in mortgage-backed securities pursue claims against a trustee under the 1939 federal Trust Indenture Act. “The decision is a watershed,” Kaswan said. Kevin Heine, a spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon, said the company was pleased that the court narrowed the issues to be considered and removed the vast majority of trusts from the suit. “We respectfully disagree with ruling’s application of the Trust Indenture Act to non-indenture securitizations and will continue to defend against those claims,” he said. Countrywide had been the largest U.S. mortgage lender before being acquired by Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America in July 2008. The lawsuit was filed six weeks after Bank of America reached the $8.5 billion settlement in June, which was to resolve claims by investors in 530 mortgage securitization trusts that lost billions of dollars when the housing market collapsed. Some investors in that case faulted Bank of New York Mellon, which negotiated the accord, for accepting a low payout. The settlement was intended to resolve many of Bank of America’s liabilities from the Countrywide purchase. In the current case, the pension funds accused Bank of New York Mellon of negligence and breach of fiduciary duty for doing nothing to remedy Countrywide’s inadequate servicing of home loans contained in the trusts. The bondholders said Bank of New York Mellon failed to take possession of loan files, including the original mortgage notes, or require Countrywide to fix or buy back defective loans. Such failures “created considerable uncertainty” and should make the bank responsible for bondholder losses, regardless of the fairness of the $8.5 billion settlement, the complaint said. Pauley said the bondholders could pursue claims that Bank of New York Mellon did not properly notify them that Countrywide had defaulted on some obligations, whether as a servicer or as a mortgage lender. The judge nonetheless said the bondholders could sue only on the basis of the 26 trusts in which they invested, not all 530 trusts covered by the $8.5 billion settlement. On February 27, Bank of America won a victory when the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the $8.5 billion settlement should be reviewed in a New York State court. That ruling reversed Pauley’s October decision to move the case to federal court. It meant the settlement’s fairness will be reviewed under a state law that gives Bank of New York Mellon wide discretion to negotiate with bondholders.

158,BK,BNY Mellon pressured to have independent chairman,"BOSTON, April 3 (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp , which has lost clients and revenue over allegations of foreign exchange fraud, is under pressure to take the chairman’s title from Chief Executive Gerald Hassell. In a letter to BNY Mellon shareholders, CtW Investment Group, which represents pension funds that own an estimated 6 million shares in the custody bank, urged investors to vote for an independent chairman at the company’s upcoming annual meeting. “We are urging support for the shareholder proposal calling for an independent chairman of the board at Bank of New York Mellon,” CtW said in a letter filed with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. “Ensuring independent leadership of the board is vitally important in light of the numerous lawsuits filed against the company alleging fraud in its foreign exchange business in an amount up to $2 billion.”",4032012,http://www.reuters.com/article/bny-mellon-chairman/bny-mellon-pressured-to-have-independent-chairman-idUSL2E8F32NT20120403
159,BK,"Analysis: Forex fine print haunts BNY Mellon, State Street","BOSTON (Reuters) - State Street Corp (STT.N) has unveiled a new twist in its legal defense against charges of foreign exchange fraud: We’re not like Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N). While both custody banks deny they routinely overcharged state pension fund clients on foreign-exchange trades, State Street is trying to score points in court by highlighting differences in the phrases it used in marketing materials, sometimes buried deep in the fine print. BNY Mellon frequently told pension fund clients that it provided forex trades “free of charge.” Boston-based State Street was less direct in some of its promotional material, often describing its forex trades as “based on” market prices. What’s a few words among banks and their pension fund clients? Plenty, as it turns out. “Cases can very much turn on words,” said Anthony Sabino, a lawyer and business professor at St. John’s University. “Certainly courts will disregard what’s deemed to be salesmanship and puffery. But they can also hold these banks to the language they use.” The banks got into trouble by promoting seemingly lower wholesale-type pricing on small, retail-size forex trades called standing instruction transactions. So-called negotiated trades, used by larger forex traders, account for most of the banks’ volume, but standing instructions are usually much more profitable. Pension funds in California, Florida, Massachusetts, New York and Virginia, for example, claim the banks got their frothy profit margins by loading them up with hidden price markups. Both banks have said those claims have no merit. State Street recently balked at comparisons to BNY Mellon in a federal court when an Arkansas pension fund attempted to link the Boston-based custody bank to its New York-based archrival. The bank said it “did not provide that FX trades would be executed ‘free of charge.’” The Arkansas Teacher Retirement System’s “attempt to analogize to BNY is misplaced,” State Street said in a filing in U.S. District Court in Boston. Pension funds and prosecutors going after BNY Mellon have put the “free of charge” phrase at the center of some of their arguments. As part of a recent motion to dismiss the government’s case in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, BNY Mellon dedicated about one-third of its 35-page response memo just to defending “free of charge” and other pricing language. “A price that includes a profit margin or ‘spread’ over the seller’s cost is not a charge,” BNY Mellon’s lawyers wrote. “Even assuming there were some ambiguity in the phrase ‘free of charge,’ BNYM’s website elsewhere made clear that BNYM assigned rates to its standing instruction transactions that reflected a mark-up over its cost of funds,” the lawyers wrote later in the memo. The U.S. Attorney in Manhattan accuses BNY Mellon of committing $1.5 billion in fraud in the case, saying the bank provided false or misleading information about forex pricing. “BNYM’s standing instruction service was anything but free of charge,” the federal prosecutor said in its civil complaint. “Nor did it minimize clients’ costs. Rather, BNYM’s pricing scheme enabled it to earn a substantial and undisclosed fee.” In the view of BNY Mellon’s top management, the sophisticated investment managers who acted on behalf of pension funds would never think the custody bank was executing forex trades for nothing. “Our clients and their investment managers understand the FX market and are paid as fiduciaries to determine what is in the best financial interests of their funds,” the bank states in the letter. “They also understand that no rational institution provides global FX services, and assumes the attendant principal risks, for free.” The bank last week scored a partial legal victory when a federal judge dismissed false claims allegations in a California case. But the full phrase “free of charge” disappeared from the section of BNY Mellon’s website about forex trades in January after negotiations with the Justice Department. The banks’ backing away from their prior marketing language indicates how legally harmful the phrase may be, according to Patrick Burns, head of communications at Taxpayers Against Fraud. The Washington-based nonprofit helps plaintiffs bring complaints against companies using the U.S. False Claims Act. “That doesn’t look good,” Burns said. “They also have to change the way they do business. This was a huge money-making deal for the banks.” State Street, meanwhile, has its own word battle to fight. The Arkansas Teacher Retirement System, for example, argued that State Street promised to make forex trades “based on” wholesale market rates. As a result, the pension fund says it should have gotten better prices than it did. But State Street’s lawyers disagreed, arguing that the words “based on” do not mean the same as “equal to.” The pension fund lawsuits have changed client behavior in the marketplace. Massachusetts’ $50 billion-plus pension fund, for example, fired BNY Mellon in December as its forex bank and told its investment managers to negotiate more forex trades directly. Pension funds have learned through widespread litigation and media reports that standing-instruction transactions are generally less favorable than directly negotiated trades. “The commonalities reside on the basic premise that these banks used wide discretion in how they executed FX trades in their favor, and in the appetite of attorney generals and investment funds to redress perceived wrongs,” said Javier Paz, an Aite Group analyst who specializes in forex matters.

160,BK,UPDATE 1-BNY Mellon to pay $6 mln over money market program,"* Fed says BNY Mellon did not immediately flag problem * Fed says bank used ineligible collateral in gov’t program * Bank expected to pay $6 mln, improve its communications By Dave Clarke April 16 (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp  will pay a $6 million penalty for breaching the terms of a 2007-2009 financial crisis era program created to aid the ailing money market mutual fund industry, the Federal Reserve announced on Monday. The Fed said the bank used ineligible collateral when securing some loans from the U.S. government in 2008 and therefore was issued more funding than it should have received. The program in question was created by the government in 2008 to provide funding for banks to buy asset-backed commercial paper from money market mutual funds that were facing liquidity problems. The program was closed in 2010. U.S. regulators are still wrestling with what steps can be taken to make money market funds less vulnerable to the problems they faced during the crisis. The Fed said Bank of New York Mellon realized in September 2008 that it had pledged ineligible collateral but did not immediately inform the government because of a failure of its “internal communication and escalation practices.” As part of the agreement the bank will devise a plan to improve its programs for communicating problems when they are discovered. In a statement, the bank said it is “pleased to put this matter behind us.”",4162012,http://www.reuters.com/article/financial-regulation-mellon/update-1-bny-mellon-to-pay-6-mln-over-money-market-program-idUSL2E8FG98E20120416

163,BK,UPDATE 1-BNY Mellon wins dismissal in Virginia FX fraud case,"BOSTON, May 1 (Reuters) - A Virginia state judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit that accused BNY Mellon Corp of overcharging on foreign exchange trades for pension funds in that state. Terrence Ney, a state judge in Fairfax County, said the pension funds, including the Virginia Retirement System, did not show evidence that they submitted claims for payment in connection with their allegations of overcharging on forex trades. A claim for payment is an essential part of proving a fraudulent action under the Virginia Fraud Against Taxpayers Act, the judge said in his ruling. BNY was accused of adding hidden markups to foreign exchange trades for the Virginia funds, which did not involve any bills being sent to the bank, Ney wrote. “Accounting records or statements in and of themselves do not amount to a claim,” the judge noted. “The court cannot rewrite the (Virginia Fraud Against Taxpayers Act) in order to have it comport with what the court believed the act may be trying to address,” the judge added later in the decision. BNY, the world’s largest custody bank, said in a statement that the decision vindicated its “position that the claims were without merit. This decision and the recent dismissal of similar whistleblower claims in California underscore our long held belief that these cases will not withstand legal scrutiny.” BNY Mellon’s forex business has been the subject of several lawsuits in which the bank has been accused of overcharging pension fund clients on certain trades.

165,BK,"RPT-INSIGHT-Upstarts break BNY, State Street's forex grip","* BNY Mellon, State Street losing forex market share * New firms pinpoint trading costs, allege excesses * Pension funds turning to new traders like Russell Investments By Tim McLaughlin BOSTON, May 2 (Reuters) - Three years ago, John Galanek co-founded FX Transparency LLC to give big investors a more sophisticated view of their foreign exchange trades. But Galanek, who previously managed forex trading for Harvard University’s massive endowment, was surprised to find little initial interest from major pension funds and other potential customers. To help keep the consulting startup going, he had to max out a second mortgage, tap his savings and even “broke the glass” on his 401(k) account. Prospects included the clients of the world’s two largest custody banks — BNY Mellon Corp and State Street Corp  — but most seemed satisfied with the prices they got on their trades even though there hadn’t been independent audits. The highly lucrative corner of Wall Street generated $1.5 billion in revenue for the two banks in 2009. But today, the once-fat forex profit margins at the two banks are under attack. Small forex analysis firms have disrupted the marketplace by providing a clearer picture of what the banks have been charging. As a result, many pension funds and other major investors are set to pay much lower fees for foreign exchange transactions than they have in the past. BNY and State Street have countered by rolling out more transparent, but less lucrative services. Both banks also are spending more on their legal bills as they fight a host of federal and state lawsuits and investigations alleging they massively overcharged their pension fund clients on forex trading. The civil fraud cases include claims by pension funds in several states, including Arkansas, California, Florida and Massachusetts. And New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman says BNY Mellon, for example, made nearly $2 billion on fraudulent trades, a charge the bank denies. The U.S. Justice Department also filed a lawsuit. The banks deny any wrongdoing and say demand for their forex services remains robust. They declined to make executives available for comment. Demand for expert analysis of foreign exchange trades is on the upswing for Galanek’s firm and a dozen or more others, according to money management executives. Pension funds and other big institutions need to trade currencies in large amounts when they buy foreign securities or collect non-dollar dividends or interest payments. The upstart firms provide in depth trade analysis using not just forex market data but also proprietary databases to show what others pay. And once clients get the data, they are either demanding much cheaper trading costs or shifting business away from the two big banks to smaller firms like Russell Investments, according to state pension fund managers. Russell is one of the first to offer to act as a fiduciary on forex trades, a legal promise to keep clients’ interest foremost, instead of acting as a principal trading for its own book. The forex money train appears to have slowed for BNY and State Street. T hough they do not disclose profitability, the combined forex revenue at the two banks in 2011 was off 4 percent from 2009 levels. And it dropped another 13 percent in the first quarter, “a worrisome trend,” according to Sanford Bernstein Research analyst Brad Hintz. BNY’s global ranking among banks trading forex for institutional clients dropped to 35th from 31st last year and State Street fell to 15th from 7th, according Euromoney Magazine’s most recent annual survey released in May, 2011. Both banks declined to comment on profitability trends. State Street supports clients using outside analysts, according to spokeswoman Carolyn Cichon. The bank has “enhanced our FX reporting services to include additional reporting and disclosures about costs of FX trading,” Cichon said in an emailed statement. BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custody bank, said it is offering new forex services to meet customers’ needs. BNY is speaking with clients so they “understand the terms and benefits of our foreign exchange services and the new options we are making available,” spokesman Kevin Heine said via email. Galanek and his co-founder, James McGeehan, a veteran Wall Street forex trader, are expanding rapidly and pitching their services to corporate treasurers as well as big investors. In December, they opened an office in London, saying European investors were just as exposed to the kinds of over-priced forex trades targeted in U.S. lawsuits. Galanek and McGeehan got their start in forex trading in the 1990s as interns for BankBoston, where they learned how banks had the incentive — and the ability — to give clients uncompetitive rates. Now, they show those same kinds of bank clients just how much they can save, even providing them with a peer percentile ranking after analyzing billions of dollars of trades. Last year, their firm snagged a high-profile assignment from the $50 billion Massachusetts public employee pension fund to analyze its trading history with BNY Mellon. FX Transparency’s audit found $30.5 million of overcharges since 2000, bolstering the administrative complaint of William Galvin, Massachusetts’ top securities regulator, against BNY Mellon last year. BNY denies overcharging the fund. “We provide all clients with a valuable service at competitive prices and any suggestion otherwise is simply wrong,” BNY said in a statement. The bank is fighting several other similar allegations in civil lawsuits brought on behalf of pension funds in California, New York and Virginia, for example. The nascent FX analysis industry is emerging in a similar pattern to the firms that began drilling down on equity trading costs in the 1980s, said James Noser, president of Abel Noser Solutions, a forex analysis firm that he launched this month as he diversifies after more than 25 years of experience examining equity and bond trades. Stock trading costs have plummeted since commissions were deregulated. “The profits of custody banks are going to shrink from this business as investment managers begin analyzing these costs systematically,” Noser said. It had been long suspected that custody banks were capitalizing on a forex franchise that provided little transparency to clients. The banks disagree. They say they provide valuable services, such as taking risk on small trades or ones involving hard-to-trade currencies. But Carol Osler, a professor and forex expert at Brandeis University, studied a mid-size global custody bank and found that forex clients paid wider price spreads on trades in which they were least informed. “Our evidence suggests that custodians set wider markups when the ambiguity or ‘fog’ surrounding their prices is highest,” Osler said in a June 2011 research paper. That fog may now be lifting. In October 2009, the California Attorney General’s office roiled the banks when it accused State Street of massive forex fraud against the state’s pension fund giants CalPERS and CalSTRS. “All of a sudden there’s a giant spotlight cast on forex trading, and that alone is going to change behavior,” said John Halligan, president of Global Trading Analytics LLC, a forex analysis pioneer that opened in 2005 in Rutherford, New Jersey. The firm reviews more than $3 trillion in trades a year. It recently won an assignment from the $20 billion-plus Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System to analyze the fund’s forex trades. Once the analysis suggests excessive costs, trading competition heats up. One firm that has been winning a growing share of trades is Russell Investments in Seattle, Washington. Known as a money manager and index provider, Russell’s forex volume grew over ten-fold to $391 billion in the last eight years. “The California lawsuit was a watershed moment. Before then, I couldn’t find a transaction cost analysis firm for FX,” said Michael DuCharme, head of foreign exchange for Russell. “Now I can tell you a dozen, if not 15.” Price concerns and subsequent analysis laid the ground work for Russell to poach from BNY Mellon the lucrative business of two large state pension funds that the bank had handled for years. In December, Massachusetts Treasurer Steve Grossman said the pension fund dropped BNY as the manager of some of its forex trades. The pension fund estimates it will save $1.1 million initially on private-equity distressed debt forex trades with Russell. And more recently, the Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System said it picked Russell to save money and dropped BNY Mellon for private equity-related forex trades. Last year, a $6 billion pension fund for Qantas Airways Limited  employees hired Russell to save members more than $1 million a year. During the search process in Iowa, BNY Mellon told the pension fund about its new and improved forex product, which at first appeared similar to Russell’s offering. But further analysis showed it would end up charging almost three times the level of commissions, Iowa officials said. BNY Mellon declined to comment on the Iowa pension fund’s remarks about its pricing. Another key difference: Russell agreed to act as the pension fund’s fiduciary, requiring that it keep the fund’s interests front and center.

166,BK,"Insight: Upstarts break BNY, State Street's forex grip","BOSTON (Reuters) - Three years ago, John Galanek co-founded FX Transparency LLC to give big investors a more sophisticated view of their foreign exchange trades. But Galanek, who previously managed forex trading for Harvard University’s massive endowment, was surprised to find little initial interest from major pension funds and other potential customers. To help keep the consulting startup going, he had to max out a second mortgage, tap his savings and even “broke the glass” on his 401(k) account. Prospects included the clients of the world’s two largest custody banks — BNY Mellon Corp and State Street Corp — but most seemed satisfied with the prices they got on their trades even though there hadn’t been independent audits. The highly lucrative corner of Wall Street generated $1.5 billion in revenue for the two banks in 2009. But today, the once-fat forex profit margins at the two banks are under attack. Small forex analysis firms have disrupted the marketplace by providing a clearer picture of what the banks have been charging. As a result, many pension funds and other major investors are set to pay much lower fees for foreign exchange transactions than they have in the past. BNY and State Street have countered by rolling out more transparent, but less lucrative services. Both banks also are spending more on their legal bills as they fight a host of federal and state lawsuits and investigations alleging they massively overcharged their pension fund clients on forex trading. The civil fraud cases include claims by pension funds in several states, including Arkansas, California, Florida and Massachusetts. And New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman says BNY Mellon, for example, made nearly $2 billion on fraudulent trades, a charge the bank denies. The U.S. Justice Department also filed a lawsuit. The banks deny any wrongdoing and say demand for their forex services remains robust. They declined to make executives available for comment. Demand for expert analysis of foreign exchange trades is on the upswing for Galanek’s firm and a dozen or more others, according to money management executives. Pension funds and other big institutions need to trade currencies in large amounts when they buy foreign securities or collect non-dollar dividends or interest payments. The upstart firms provide in depth trade analysis using not just forex market data but also proprietary databases to show what others pay. And once clients get the data, they are either demanding much cheaper trading costs or shifting business away from the two big banks to smaller firms like Russell Investments, according to state pension fund managers. Russell is one of the first to offer to act as a fiduciary on forex trades, a legal promise to keep clients’ interest foremost, instead of acting as a principal trading for its own book. The forex money train appears to have slowed for BNY and State Street. Though they do not disclose profitability, the combined forex revenue at the two banks in 2011 was off 4 percent from 2009 levels. And it dropped another 13 percent in the first quarter, “a worrisome trend,” according to Sanford Bernstein Research analyst Brad Hintz. BNY’s global ranking among banks trading forex for institutional clients dropped to 35th from 31st last year and State Street fell to 15th from 7th, according Euromoney Magazine’s most recent annual survey released in May, 2011. Both banks declined to comment on profitability trends. State Street supports clients using outside analysts, according to spokeswoman Carolyn Cichon. The bank has “enhanced our FX reporting services to include additional reporting and disclosures about costs of FX trading,” Cichon said in an emailed statement. BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custody bank, said it is offering new forex services to meet customers’ needs. BNY is speaking with clients so they “understand the terms and benefits of our foreign exchange services and the new options we are making available,” spokesman Kevin Heine said via email. Galanek and his co-founder, James McGeehan, a veteran Wall Street forex trader, are expanding rapidly and pitching their services to corporate treasurers as well as big investors. In December, they opened an office in London, saying European investors were just as exposed to the kinds of over-priced forex trades targeted in U.S. lawsuits.

170,BK,"BNY Mellon, IRS spar over $900 million tax benefit","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) faced off against the U.S. government on Thursday in closing arguments over a $900 million tax benefit that the Internal Revenue Service called “tax abuse.” The case is the first to go to trial since the IRS accused some banks of generating artificial foreign tax credits through loans with London-based Barclays Plc (BARC.L). The tax benefit stems from a $1.5 billion loan to BNY Mellon from Barclays Plc (BARC.L), which also helped several other U.S. banks generate billions in foreign tax credits. Barclays has not been accused of any wrongdoing. Bank of New York’s financing agreement “is just tax abuse tacked onto a pricey loan,” Jill Frisch, attorney for the IRS, told U.S. Tax Court Judge Diane Kroupa. The banks in question used foreign tax credits, which are given to U.S. companies to prevent them from being double-taxed by two countries for the same income. The banks call it a legal funding strategy; the government calls them sham tax shelters. “No business willingly subjects its profits to double taxation on the same income,” Bernard J. Williams, an attorney for Bank of New York, argued. The bank has said that it may have to change its reserve for uncertain tax events by a net amount of up to $850 million depending on the outcome of the case, according to regulatory filings. Each of the banks that got loans from Barclays say it advanced their core business.

174,BK,UPDATE 1-Alabama group wants $1.6 bln in bankruptcy case,"(Adds quotes from Bank of New York) By Michael Connor June 5 (Reuters) - Local politicians in Alabama’s bankrupt Jefferson County are pressing a new $1.6 billion claim on behalf of 130,000 sewer system customers they say were cheated by corrupt county workers and Wall Street creditors. Working against a U.S. Bankruptcy Court deadline on Monday for claims in Jefferson County’s landmark, $4.23 billion bankruptcy case, Roderick Royal, the president of the Birmingham City Council, and 13 others on Monday filed a claim against creditors of Jefferson County and its sewer system. The filing argues that the sewer system’s rate payers, including the two-thirds who live in low-income Birmingham, were hurt by Wall Street financing techniques and the corruption of more than 20 office holders and others convicted of crimes. The filers, who include state representatives and the Jefferson County tax assessor, claim the rate payers had so far paid $1.6 billion unnecessarily because of a “continuing pattern of misconduct and criminal activity by managerial personnel of the county acting in collusion with other wrongdoers, including many of the top 20 creditors.” One of the county’s biggest creditors, JPMorgan Chase , agreed in 2009 to a $722 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over charges of illegal payments made to secure county financing work. Larry Langford, a former county commissioner, was convicted of taking bribes. The filing requests class-action status on behalf of the system’s customers and said any money recovered would be used to prevent rate hikes by reducing the roughly $3 billion of sewer-system debt at the heart of Jefferson County’s Nov. 9 municipal bankruptcy filing, which was the biggest by any U.S. local government. “My personal feeling is that it will be dismissed,” Jefferson County Commission President David Carrington said of the claim on Tuesday. “If it’s not, it will be interesting.” Thomas Bennett, the U.S. bankruptcy judge handling the case, was likely to view the $1.6 billion in alleged damages as excessive and dismiss the suit, a local lawyer involved in the bankruptcy said on condition of anonymity. Bank of New York, which is the indenture trustee for creditors in the bankruptcy case, declined to comment in detail on the filing but “is confident it has fulfilled its duties,” BNY spokesman Kevin Heine said. The filing adds a new front to the battles in the case. Last week, Bennett issued an order approving a continuation of a deal struck Feb. 15 that required the county to make $5.5 million in monthly payments to creditors on its sewer debt through May. In April, the county skipped a $15 million general obligation bond payment for the first time, as officials said they needed the money to pay for basic government services. State legislators in May spurned a bid by the county to revive a wages tax that would have delivered an estimated $60 million a year in revenue. On Monday, Jefferson County commissioners scheduled a public hearing for June 12 on possible sewer rate hikes.

176,BK,"BNY Mellon profit falls, bank worries over euro deposits","(Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) on Wednesday reported lower second-quarter profit and discussed charging clients on their euro deposits as jittery investors feel more comfortable parking their cash rather than buying stocks and bonds. BNY Mellon executives said they are worried the bank could see a prolonged trend of excess deposit accumulation because of problems in the euro zone. Holding excess deposits increases costs while the bank struggles to earn money on the funds in an ultra-low interest rate environment. “Europe is still an absolute mess,” BNY Mellon Chief Executive Gerald Hassell said on a conference call. BNY Mellon Chief Financial Officer Todd Gibbons told Reuters it was possible the bank would impose some kind of charge on euro deposits. No decision has been made, he said. In the second quarter, total noninterest-bearing client deposits at the bank were $63 billion, up 46 percent from year-ago levels. The bank declined to give a breakdown of euro deposits. As Nomura Equity Research analyst Glenn Schorr said in a research report, BNY Mellon’s net interest margin — largely the difference between what the bank pays on deposits and what it earns on the money through investing — fell to 1.25 percent, compared with 1.41 percent in the year-ago period. The bank’s core fees were strong, but that was offset by weak net interest income and lower investment income, Ken Usdin, an analyst at Jefferies & Co Inc, said in a research note. The world’s largest custody bank reported quarterly net income of $466 million, or 39 cents a share, compared with $735 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, Gibbons said the bank's core earnings in the quarter were about 53 cents a share, matching the estimates of analysts. BNY Mellon shares, which closed 3 cents lower at $21.69, are down nearly 12 percent over the past 12 months, while the S&P; 500 index .SPX has climbed 5 percent. As announced earlier this month, the quarterly results included an after-tax charge of $212 million to settle an investor lawsuit accusing the bank of imprudently investing their cash in a risky debt vehicle that collapsed in 2008. Quarterly revenue fell to $3.62 billion from $3.85 billion. Assets under custody and administration amounted to $27.1 trillion, an increase of 3 percent from a year earlier. Investment management fees declined 3 percent to $749 million on lower mutual fund revenue. But performance fees in the quarter tripled to $54 million from year-ago levels. Foreign exchange revenue fell 15 percent to $157 million. BNY Mellon faces several lawsuits that accuse the bank of overcharging on forex trades, but denies any wrongdoing. The bank’s wealth management unit reported average loans totaled $7.76 billion, an increase of 13 percent over year-ago levels. Wealth management’s average deposits climbed 25 percent to $11.3 billion. The bank continued to book net inflows into its investment funds.

179,BK,Court keeps BNY Mellon ahead of Sentinel clients in payment line,"* Appeals court affirms bank had “secured position” on loan * Sentinel allegedly used client assets to secure loan * Futures broker collapsed when credit crisis hit in 2007 By Tom Polansek and Ann Saphir CHICAGO, Aug 9 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court has upheld a ruling that puts Bank of New York Mellon in line ahead of former customers of Sentinel Management Group to be paid back money lost in the 2007 collapse of the futures broker. The appeals court affirmed an earlier district court ruling that Bank of New York Mellon had a “secured position” on a $312 million loan it gave to Sentinel. Sentinel allegedly pledged hundreds of millions of dollars in customer assets to secure an overnight loan at the bank, leaving the bank in a secured position but Sentinel’s customers out millions. Futures brokers are required to keep customers’ funds in dedicated accounts to protect them from being used for anything other than client business. At Sentinel, customer funds were allegedly moved from the protected accounts to other accounts so they could be used as collateral for loans to Sentinel’s own trading operations. The appeals court said that “perhaps the bank should have known that Sentinel violated segregation requirements” but agreed with the district court’s earlier ruling that “such a lack of care does not rise to the level of the egregious misconduct” needed to reprioritize a claim. A bank spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. The decision is a blow for Frederick Grede, the trustee in Sentinel’s bankruptcy, who had sought to strip Bank of New York Mellon of its secured position. Sentinel largely managed money for other futures brokers, delivering outsized returns that, Grede says, were juiced up by improperly using customer money to secure loans that went to fund risky trades. The scheme unraveled when the credit crisis hit in the summer of 2007.",8092012,http://www.reuters.com/article/sentinel-appeals-decision/court-keeps-bny-mellon-ahead-of-sentinel-clients-in-payment-line-idUSL2E8J99HK20120809
180,BK,"UPDATE 2-State Street, BNY Mellon submit living wills to Fed","By Alexandra Alper and Emily Stephenson WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - State Street Corp and Bank of New York Mellon Corp have submitted their living wills to banking regulators, the Federal Reserve announced on Thursday. The plans give regulators a road map for dismantling the firms if they become insolvent and are aimed at easing concerns that some banks are so big and complex that their failure could destabilize the financial system. The wills were mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, which sought to limit risk in the financial system, after risky  trades at major Wall Street firms led to multi-billion dollar taxpayer bailouts and disruptive bankruptcies. Nine of the largest U.S. banks submitted their plans by a July deadline, including Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc. Regulators staggered the deadline for banks, based upon their size. Banks with $100 billion or more in assets are set to report by July 1, 2013, and all remaining banks with at least $50 billion in assets will have to submit plans by Dec. 31, 2013. Regulators said they had received the State Street and BNY Mellon living wills by an Oct. 1 deadline. It was not immediately clear why the two firms received a different deadline than other institutions. The living wills rules allow regulators to change the reporting deadline for individual companies. A portion of the wills are made public, while another part is kept confidential to allay banks’ concerns that regulators could divulge proprietary information to competitors. Most banks have used the public section to highlight the strength of their portfolio and underscore the unlikelihood of failure. “State Street believes that its strong capital position, high-quality assets and fee-based business model make it unlikely that a severe idiosyncratic event leading up to a loss in asset value, a run on deposits or other liquidity crises would occur,” the bank said in the public portion of its living will. BNY Mellon said that most of its revenue comes from recurring fees and that the bank is not substantially exposed to credit risk. “This helps BNY Mellon maintain a strong, highly liquid balance sheet with a solid capital position and strong credit ratings,” the bank said. “Our highly liquid balance sheet would allow us to withstand deposit run-off without systemic impact.” The living will rules, which were finalized in October 2011, give the banks a series of chances to refine their plans. But if banks cannot come up with feasible liquidation plans, regulators could order the banks to get rid of businesses. The plans that the banks submit will also help regulators revise their own resolution plans for large institutions, which are meant to guide the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp if it has to unwind a financial giant on its own rather than go through a bankruptcy proceeding.

184,BK,"BNY Mellon profit rises, but analysts worry about fees","(Reuters) - BNY Mellon Corp (BK.N) reported an 11 percent rise in third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, beating analysts’ expectations, as money management and performance fees increased. While BNY Mellon’s stock rose 4.1 percent to $24.52, some analysts expressed concern about the revenue trends at the world’s largest custody bank’s core investment servicing business, which tracks mutual fund prices and collects and distributes dividend and interest payments for investors. The bank reported a sharp decline in revenue from trading foreign exchange currencies and a 6 percent drop in overall investment services fees. CLSA Ltd analyst Mike Mayo described what was happening to BNY Mellon’s servicing fees as a “bloodbath.” “It just keeps getting worse and worse,” Mayo told BNY Mellon executives on a conference call. “If I look at your services fees, including foreign exchange and securities lending, this is the lowest percentage of those fees to assets under custody in your history.” BNY Mellon CEO Gerald Hassell said foreign exchange revenue, hit hard by changing client behavior and lower volatility in currency markets, might not stage a complete comeback. “Foreign exchange is going the route of the equity markets - more electronic, higher-speed and streaming prices to clients on a consistent basis, giving them greater optionality in terms of how they execute with us,” Hassell said. And overall, pricing for the plain-vanilla custodial business remains under pressure, Bernstein Research analyst Brad Hintz said in a research note. Executives at BNY Mellon and rival State Street Corp (STT.N) have acknowledged they have a hard time getting price increases from their largest clients. Both custody banks have been fighting lawsuits from customers and U.S. authorities accusing them of overcharging on certain forex trades. While the banks deny any wrongdoing, they concede that customers have shifted some of their forex activity to cheaper alternatives such as electronic trading. BNY Mellon, meanwhile, said investment management and performance fees were a bright spot. Those fees rose 7 percent to $779 million from year-earlier levels as the bank booked $9 billion of long-term inflows into stock and bond funds in the third quarter. The bank’s 2009 acquisition of London-based Insight Investment is paying off as leading United Kingdom-based pension funds make investments to manage their liabilities, which have increased amid ultra-low interest rates. “That’s been one of real fast growers,” Chief Financial Officer Todd Gibbons told Reuters. In contrast, BNY said investment services fees totaled $1.7 billion for the quarter, down from $1.8 billion a year earlier. Net income was $720 million, or 61 cents a share, including a benefit of 4 cents per share from a lower-than-expected effective tax rate. That compared with $651 million, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected a profit of 54 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total fee revenue was nearly flat at $2.88 billion, hurt by a 45 percent decline in the foreign exchange operation. State Street’s third-quarter foreign exchange revenue dropped 44 percent to $115 million. BNY Mellon’s assets under custody and administration totaled $27.9 trillion, up 3 percent from the second quarter and 8 percent from a year earlier. The increases reflect higher market values and winning new business. Net interest revenue - largely the difference between what the bank pays on deposits and earns on loans and investments - fell 3 percent to $754 million from a year earlier. Net interest margin was 1.2 percent on lower investment yields and the elimination of interest on European Central Bank deposits.

But the bank declined to comment on any deal over the litigation. The settlement ends one legal chapter for the bank, but it still faces many other lawsuits from pensions funds in other states. Virginia’s case was among the first to allege the bank was converting currency based on prices at the end of the day instead of when the trades took place, potentially costing clients millions of dollars. BNY Mellon, which traces it roots back to Alexander Hamilton and is the nation’s oldest bank, has been vigorously challenging the lawsuits. The Virginia lawsuit filed by Virginia Attorney General Kenneth Cuccinelli was an outgrowth of an earlier suit brought by a whistleblower group that sued the bank on behalf of the Virginia Retirement System Fund and pension plans in Arlington and Fairfax counties. Among those involved in the whistleblower group was Harry Markopolos, best known for giving an early warning to U.S. securities regulators that Bernard Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme. The whistleblower was a senior BNY Mellon foreign-exchange trader named Grant Wilson. Virginia has paid the whistleblower group $1.1 million for its role in aiding the state’s case. Cuccinelli looked for $120 million in damages and about $811.6 million in civil penalties. In the lawsuit, he claimed BNY Mellon “as custodian bank for the Virginia funds knowingly and systematically earned hundreds of millions of dollars” by improperly charging for certain types of currency transactions. The Virginia claim was dealt a setback in May when a state judge in Virginia dismissed a lawsuit that alleged the bank overcharged for currency transactions. At the time, the judge ruled the Virginia complaint did not in fact meet the threshold for a state false claims act. But the judge did leave the door open for Virginia to refile. Virginia then filed an amended complaint in July. The settlement was disclosed last month in meeting minutes for the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors. A spokesman for Cuccinelli did not return request for comment.",11082012,http://www.reuters.com/article/pension-settlement-currency/update-1-bny-mellon-virginia-make-deal-on-currency-trades-claim-idUSL1E8M8HJ220121108

191,BK,UPDATE 5-Argentina asks US judge to wait for bond dispute appeal,"* Gov’t seeks final appeals ruling before allowing payments * Holdout ruling raises “technical default” fears * BNY Mellon says lifting of payment blockage would be a problem   (Recasts, new throughout) By Daniel Bases and Nate Raymond NEW YORK, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Argentina asked a U.S. judge late on Friday to maintain his order blocking payment on defaulted sovereign bonds to holdout investors until lingering questions are settled in a higher court’s appeals process. Less than 15 minutes before a midnight deadline on Friday, Argentina’s lawyers filed their brief outlining why U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa should reject the argument by holdout creditors to pay them in full on debt that has been in default since 2002. The arguments came three days after Argentina asked the U.S.  2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York to reconsider its Oct. 26 ruling that favored these holdout bondholders and rattled financial markets in the process. That decision upheld the ruling, that was made by Griesa, that found the South American nation discriminated against bondholders such as Elliott Management Corp’s NML Capital Ltd and Aurelius Capital Management. They refused to take part in two debt restructurings as Argentina tried to recover from a $100 billion default a decade ago. Greisa had put his own ruling on hold pending the appeal and Argentinia on Friday argued he should keep the freeze in place until outstanding issues were settled. “The Court should not accept the false urgency plaintiffs are trying to create and allow the Republic and all potentially affected third parties to prosecute their appeal rights before any orders go into effect,” Argentina said in its brief. After the 2nd Circuit’s ruling, Argentine officials were widely cited in the media saying they would flout the court and continue to pay investors who participated in the debt swaps but would never pay the holdout investors. That prompted Griesa to demand a direct government pledge to comply with his orders. National Director of Argentina’s National Bureau of Public Credit, Francisco Eggers, submitted a signed affidavit saying the government would abide by the court’s rulings and not seek to evade its directives. “As directed by the court, on behalf of the Republic, I confirm that the Republic has complied, and will comply with the terms...,” Eggers said. Last month’s ruling led to fears U.S. courts could ultimately inhibit debt payments to creditors who accepted the terms of the restructuring, out of consideration for investors who rejected Argentina’s terms at the time. This would trigger a technical default on approximately $24 billion worth of debt issued in the 2005 and 2010 exchanges. “It is far beyond the bounds of equity to seek to enforce the rights of one litigant by jeopardizing the rights of others,” lawyers representing a group of bondholders who participated in the exchange, led by Gramercy Funds Management LLC., said on Friday. The briefs from Argentina and the exchange bondholders addressed two questions that the appeals court had referred back to Griesa for answers. These were technical questions of how debt payments would be calculated and how to treat the involvement of third-party banks such as Bank of New York Mellon, which act as transfer agents for money owed to exchange bondholders. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez said immediately following the October decision her country would not pay “one dollar to the vulture funds”. That is her term for holdout investors who buy distressed or defaulted debt and then sue in international courts to get paid in full. Eggers’ statement contrasted with Fernandez’s vow to keep making payments to other creditors. Argentine bonds closed up 1 percent on average in over-the-counter trading in Buenos Aires on Friday after accumulating a loss of 4.1 percent in the previous three sessions. Bank of New York Mellon, which transfers funds from the Argentine government to the country’s bond holders, argued in a brief filed late on Friday to Griesa that it is not an agent of the Argentine government and maintains an “arm’s length” relationship. The bank said its “duty of loyalty runs to the Exchange holders”, that is, to enforce the rights of investors who exchanged their bonds in 2005 and 2010. “Punishing an innocent third party to try to obtain compliance from an enjoined party goes beyond any legitimate purpose for contempt,” BNY Mellon said. The bank said it could be put between a rock and a hard place if Griesa rules they are to make payments to all parties but are prohibited because Argentina does not transfer any money through it. “BNY Mellon will face a potential conflict between its obligations to Exchange Holders under the Indenture and its obligations to the Court,” the bank argued. In that case, the bank said, it needs guidance from Griesa on what its duties and responsibilities would be. Ultimately, the bank wants Griesa’s order to remain in place, leaving the the payments frozen until the 2nd Circuit reviews and rules on his logic. The judge is expected to make a speedy response as Argentina is due to start making $3.3 billion worth of payments to exchange bondholders starting Dec. 2. Griesa’s ruling will automatically return to the appeals court for review. In a court filing this week, NML and Aurelius urged Griesa to lift his Feb. 23 stay on payments pending appeal. October’s ruling by the appeals court largely upheld injunctions issued in February by Griesa in favor of the holdouts, which own roughly $1.4 billion of defaulted debt. The holdouts said in their argument to Griesa that terms of the swapped Argentine bonds may allow the country to circumvent the United States by using subsidiaries in London and Luxembourg to make debt payments. Weighing in on the arguments before the deadline were other transfer agents, holdout investors and exchange bond holders. The Clearing House Association, a banking association and payments company, sent a letter to Griesa explaining that any order should not apply to beneficiary’s banks, funds-transfer systems or other parties in a funds transfer. The letter was obtained from a source with direct knowledge of the case. It argued the ruling would cause “disruption of payment systems and delays in processing legitimate payments” made by Argentine entities that have nothing to do with the case. Law firm Duane Morris, representing about 100 mainly Italian holdout investors with approximately $165 million in principal and pre-judgement interest, sided with NML. “Despite its proclaimed ability to pay, Argentina has steadfastly refused to make payments that are due under the defaulted bonds - even to the individuals who are not “vultures”, Anthony Costantini, a lawyer with Duane Morris wrote in a brief to Griesa on Friday. On the other side are bond holders who participated in the exchanges who urged that NML not be allowed to collect on its judgments. Fintech Advisory Inc, a New York investment management firm that gave up $698.9 million of the $1.052 billion it was owed by Argentina during the two debt swaps, argued if the judge sided with the holdout bondholders, Argentina would be in breach of contracts with exchange bondholders like itself. “There is no basis for any order to cause such a result,” Fintech’s lawyers wrote.

192,BK,UPDATE 2-Argentina urges U.S. court to halt payment to creditors,"* Argentina says U.S. court order to pay holdouts must be suspended * BNY Mellon, other third parties could face “extreme harm” * Argentina says ruling could discourage use of N.Y. law debt restructuring   (Updates to include Fitch downgrade of Argentine rating) By Nate Raymond Nov 27 (Reuters) - Shaken by the prospect of another debt default, Argentina has sought to halt a U.S. court order that it must pay $1.3 billion to a minority of its creditors by mid-December by trying to persuade an appeals court this would hurt banks and other investors. The move by Argentina follows a separate move by other creditors late Monday to also overturn the court order to pay the small group of bondholders who did not participate in the country’s 2005 and 2010 debt restructurings. After a legal battle lasting nearly a decade, U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa last week ordered Argentina to deposit  money before Dec. 15 to pay the so-called “holdout” creditors who did not agree to the debt restructurings. About 93 percent of Argentina’s other bondholders participated in the plans. While the legal battle continues, Fitch Ratings agency downgraded the country’s sovereign credit rating to “CC” from “B” on Tuesday. Fitch said it views an Argentine default as “probable” after the court decision. The “holdout” investors sued to recover the full value of bonds that Argentina stopped paying in 2002, setting up a battle with the country’s left-leaning government, which branded them as “vulture funds” and has refused to pay them. The funds got a major boost last month when a U.S. appeals court ruled Argentina must pay them in full when it services the restructured debt that most of the country’s other creditors grudgingly accepted. That deal included a painful “haircut” or writedown for investors of about 70 percent of the bonds’ value. The litigation has kept the country out of global credit markets for the last decade and could spark a new debt crisis in Latin America’s No. 3 economy by jeopardizing payments on $24 billion of the restructured debt, Argentina’s lawyers argue. They also say the latest rulings could undermine the ability of other governments to negotiate future debt restructurings. In an emergency motion to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals late Monday, Argentina sought to suspend an order made by U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in New York last week, requiring that Argentina deposit the $1.3 billion in an escrow account by Dec. 15, when a roughly $3 billion payment comes due on Argentina’s growth-linked GDP warrants. Argentina announced on Monday that it appealed the order and the court papers were made public on Tuesday. The South American country said in its motion that the 2nd Circuit should delay Griesa’s payment order while it appeals other aspects of the case. It said forcing a payment to holdout creditors would destroy its debt restructuring and cause “extreme harm to numerous third parties.” Prices for the debt issued in Argentina’s swaps - including Par and Discount bonds - have sunk by as much as 30 percent in the last month. At the same time, the cost of protection against an Argentine default has spiked higher. Argentina said it could not comply with Griesa’s order under local law, which prohibits paying the holdout creditors on better terms than the bondholders who accepted the debt swaps, known as “exchange bondholders”. Argentina also said it may not be able to service its restructured debt if Griesa’s order remains in place. The roughly 93 percent of bondholders who agreed to swap their defaulted bonds at a heavy loss now fear a “technical default” and some of them have appealed against Griesa’s ruling, too. “The order for an immediate escrow under these threats is impossible to comply with and disregards the many third party interests involved as well as the Republic’s sovereignty,” Argentina said in the motion. Kathryn Rooney Vera, Latin America strategist at Bulltick Capital Partners in Miami, said the court might be sympathetic to those third-party U.S. intermediaries. “The third party entities will have more sway than Argentina, as you can tell from the official ruling,” she said. “The courts don’t care about Argentina and what they think, more about how this is going to affect the parties.” Griesa’s order issued last Wednesday was a setback for Argentina’s fiery President Cristina Fernandez, who has said she would never pay the “vulture funds.” They include Elliott Management Corp affiliate NML Capital Ltd and the Aurelius Capital Management funds. Their spokesmen either had no immediate comment or did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Griesa’s order came in response to an Oct. 26 finding by the 2nd Circuit that Argentina violated bond provisions requiring it treat bondholders equally when it paid the creditors who entered the debt swaps ahead of the holdouts. The 2nd Circuit sent the case back to Griesa to have him address how the payment formula would work and determine how the court’s injunctions would apply to third parties, such as Bank of New York Mellon Corp, which acts as trustee for the exchange bondholders. In its brief on Tuesday, Argentina said Griesa’s order failed to address the 2nd Circuit’s concerns. “It is unprecedented - and unwarranted - to hold liable as aiders and abettors participants in the financial markets doing no more than carrying out their normal business functions and fulfilling their own obligations to third parties,” it said. The country said it would be “manifestly unreasonable” to apply the injunction to BNY Mellon. Once funds are transferred to BNY Mellon, Argentina said they are no longer the country’s property and belong exclusively to the exchange bondholders. Argentina also said allowing the order to remain standing would “both hugely impair the use of New York law to govern sovereign and corporate issuances and severely disadvantage New York financial institutions with respect to such issuances.” A spokesman for BNY Mellon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The bank has said it does not believe it should be bound by the injunction. A group of exchange bondholders on Monday filed a separate motion backing Argentina in seeking a halt to Griesa’s order. Argentina said those bondholders “could not have anticipated this outcome.” “Had the exchange bondholders remotely understood that their contracts supported this extraordinary result, no one would have entered into an exchange offer in the first place,” Argentina said.

195,BK,Court withdraws win for BNY Mellon in Sentinel case,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court in the United States has withdrawn a ruling that put Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) ahead of former customers of Sentinel Management Group seeking to recoup money lost in the futures broker’s 2007 collapse. In a two-line ruling that gave no further explanation, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit withdrew an August 9 opinion. “This appeal remains under consideration by the panel,” the three-judge panel wrote in a ruling dated November 30. The decision overturns an August opinion from the same court affirming an earlier district court ruling that Bank of New York Mellon had a “secured position” on a $312 million loan it gave to Sentinel. Frederick Grede, the trustee in Sentinel’s bankruptcy, alleged that the broker pledged hundreds of millions of dollars in customer assets to secure an overnight loan at the bank, leaving the bank in a secured position but Sentinel’s customers with losses of millions. Futures brokers are required to keep customers’ funds in dedicated accounts to protect them from being used for anything other than client business. At Sentinel, customer funds were allegedly moved from the protected accounts to other accounts so they could be used as collateral for loans to Sentinel’s own trading operations. The appeals court said in August that “perhaps the bank should have known that Sentinel violated segregation requirements” but agreed with the district court’s earlier ruling that “such a lack of care does not rise to the level of the egregious misconduct” needed to reprioritize a claim. That decision was a blow for Grede, who had sought to strip Bank of New York Mellon of its secured position. Sentinel largely managed money for other futures brokers, delivering outsized returns that Grede says were boosted by improperly using customer money to secure loans that funded risky trades.

Morgan Stanley also named Susie Huang and Michele Colocci as vice chairmen of investment banking. Colocci had been head of European M&A; and will remain chairman of M&A; in that region. The largest custody bank appointed Karen Peetz as president. Peetz is currently the vice chairman and chief executive officer of Financial Markets & Treasury Services. The bank also named Timothy Keaney as chief executive of Investment Services and Brian Shea as president of Investment Services and the head of BNY Mellon’s Global Operations and Technology group.

198,BK,TEXT - S&P; says Bank of New York Mellon rtgs unaffected by Q4 earning,"Jan 16 - Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services today said its ratings on Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK; A+/Negative/A-1) are not affected by the company’s fair fourth-quarter earnings, which reflected a modest overall decline in revenue and rise in expenses relative to the third quarter. Results broadly met our expectations in the context of the difficult market conditions, namely low reinvestment yields and subdued market activity. We anticipate that the company will continue to face net interest margin (NIM) compression from very low rates in the coming quarters, but overall fee revenue generation from its diversified investment servicing and asset management businesses should remain relatively stable and within our expectations for the ratings.  The company reported net income available to shareholders of $622 million,  versus $720 million in the third quarter. Despite the decline, operating  earnings were satisfactory, in our view, as the company posted an approximate  27% pretax operating margin, down slightly from the third quarter. BK had  negative operating leverage, as total revenue dipped 1%, while operating  expenses rose 4% from the previous quarter. Still, we anticipate that BK will  continue to focus on expense controls in 2013. In addition, a low tax rate, a  $61 million loan loss provision credit, and $50 million in realized securities  gains boosted results in the fourth quarter.   Investment services fees declined 5% from the third quarter, mainly because of  a seasonal decrease in depositary receipt revenue. Positively, the largest  component of fee income—asset servicing fees—remained solid, which net new  business partly aided. Securities lending and foreign exchange trading revenue  decreased during the quarter, reflecting lower market activity. Investment  management fees (including performance fees) rose 9% from the previous  quarter, and that business maintained good inflows of long-term assets under  management (AUM). Overall, assets under custody and administration were about  unchanged, supported by net new business, while AUM increased 2% from the  third quarter to $1.4 trillion, reflecting both higher market valuations and  net new business.  Despite a rise in earning assets, BK’s net interest revenue declined 3% during  the quarter, as its NIM narrowed a substantial 11 basis point to a very thin  1.09%. The company estimated that 6 basis points of the NIM decline stemmed  from an inflow of customer deposits that the company placed into low-yielding  Federal Reserve Bank deposits. We expect the NIM to remain narrow in the  coming quarters because of lower reinvestment rates on the company’s  securities, although the company may seek to shift to slightly  higher-yielding, albeit high-quality, assets.   As we expected, BK’s capital ratios rose during the fourth quarter, reflecting  some earnings retention after the bank deployed $417 million of capital  (including $170 million of stock buybacks). This total payout represents 67%  of net income. We anticipate the company will continue to buy back stock at a  similar pace in the next quarter under its $1.16 billion program. However, our  rating reflects our assumption that BK’s total payout will generally not  exceed 65% over the next two years. BK estimated that its Basel III Tier I  common equity ratio (under the Federal Reserve’s new proposed rules) rose 50  basis points in the quarter to 9.8% because of lower risk-adjusted assets and  earnings retention.   The negative rating outlook on BK reflects our negative outlook on the U.S.  sovereign rating because of the one notch of uplift we incorporate into our  ratings on BK, given our expectation of potential extraordinary U.S.  government support. Otherwise, we continue to view BK’s fundamental trends as  stable. We expect that BK’s overall financial performance will remain  satisfactory, although earnings power should remain subdued because of low  interest rates. The rating reflects our expectation that BK will increase its  risk-adjusted capital ratio, based on our measurement, to more than 7.0%  over  the next few years through earnings generation, the run-off of its  speculative-grade MBS portfolio, and conservative capital management.",1162013,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNB002HT20130116
199,BK,"BNY Mellon profit rises but expenses, revenue disappoint","BOSTON (Reuters) - BNY Mellon Corp (BK.N) said fourth-quarter earnings rose 23 percent, but its shares fell as investors showed disappointment with declines in foreign exchange activity, subdued revenue from deposits and an uptick in expenses. The bank’s profit matched Wall Street estimates, but its shares fell 2.8 percent to $26.02 on Wednesday. With interest rates scraping along the bottom, BNY Mellon’s net interest margin - largely the difference between what it gets from loans and what it pays on deposits - was 1.09 percent in the fourth quarter, down from 1.27 percent a year ago. With the fiscal cliff looming, the bank experienced a surge in deposits, hurting that margin, BNY Mellon Chief Executive Gerald Hassell explained on a conference call. “We saw a run-up of $20 billion, $30 billion in our deposits,” Hassell said. “I think the debt ceiling is going to put another potential concern in the eyes of investors ... We are seeing people trying to put some money to work, but still there’s an enormous amount of cash sitting on the sidelines waiting for better certainty and clarity.” The bank also has been hurt by declines in revenue in some business segments that have relatively high fixed costs, BNY Mellon Chief Financial Officer Todd Gibbons said in a telephone interview. But that has been offset by strong gains in revenue, for example, from the bank’s investment management business. Nomura analyst Glenn Schorr said strong investment management fees, good deposit growth and solid capital ratios were partially offset by higher expenses, weak trading revenue and flat servicing fees. “All in, progress on some fronts and great asset management results, but the net earnings picture still hovers in a similar range,” Schorr said in a research note. “Expect the stock to be a bit soft post the recent run.” Net income was $622 million, or 53 cents a share, up from $505 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. Investment management and performance fees surged 17 percent to $853 million on buoyant stock market returns. Assets under management were up 10 percent to $1.39 billion. Fees from investment services rose 1 percent to $1.6 billion. Assets under custody and administration climbed 9 percent to $26.7 trillion. Revenue from trading foreign currencies continued to be a weak spot. Foreign exchange revenue totaled $106 million, down 42 percent, on declining volatility and volumes. The bank is battling several lawsuits, defending itself against allegations of overcharging pension funds and other customers on forex fees, a charge it denies.

202,BK,Judge OKs Salvation Army lawsuit versus BNY Mellon,"(Reuters) - A judge refused to throw out a lawsuit accusing Bank of New York Mellon of mismanaging The Salvation Army assets by investing nearly $22 million of the charity’s funds in mortgage-backed securities and other risky investments. The Salvation Army, one of the largest U.S. charities, claims in its lawsuit that the bank didn’t abide by its obligation to invest in conservative assets and failed to take steps to protect the charity as market conditions deteriorated. The charity, which filed the lawsuit in 2011 in New York State Supreme Court, is seeking damages for breach of fiduciary duty and other claims. The Salvation Army must only “state a claim at this juncture, not prove it,” Justice Barbara Kapnick wrote in her January 25 decision denying the bank’s motion to dismiss the breach of fiduciary duty claim. Kapnick also let stand breach of contract and gross negligence claims. She dismissed a claim for negligent misrepresentation. The judge noted the Salvation Army’s claim that the bank invested the charities’ funds in high-risk securities despite reducing its own exposure to such investments. The bank said it abided by its securities lending agreement with The Salvation Army, according to the judge’s ruling. It urged the court to consider the entire investment portfolio which, the bank said, did well. It said only six of 25 mortgage-backed securities purchased encountered difficulty, according to the judge. “We’re pleased that the court’s procedural decision narrowed the case, dismissing one of the claims against BNY Mellon,” said Jeep Bryant, a spokesman for the bank. “As the litigation proceeds, we’re confident the facts will demonstrate that the remaining claims are also without merit.” The case is The Salvation Army v.

207,BK,Monte Paschi struck secret deal over Antonveneta: police,,2082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-montepaschi/monte-paschi-struck-secret-deal-over-antonveneta-police-idUSBRE91712920130208
208,BK,Monte Paschi struck secret deal over Antonveneta -police,"SIENA, Italy, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Monte dei Paschi struck a last-minute, secret deal with Bank of New York that allowed the Italian bank to mislead authorities and smoothed through its acquisition of rival Antonveneta, according to a report by the financial police in Italy. A deepening fraud and bribery scandal at the country’s third largest bank has caused a political outcry ahead of a parliamentary election on Feb. 24-25, with the Bank of Italy under fire over suspected financial irregularities at the Tuscan institution. Monte dei Paschi’s 9-billion euro purchase of Antonveneta in 2008 precipitated an eventual state bailout and prosecutors in its home city of Siena are probing whether it deliberately overpaid and whether bribery was involved. Monte dei Paschi’s current management have said they have found no evidence of bribery. In a report by Italy’s financial police provided to prosecutors for their investigation and reviewed by Reuters, the police say that Monte dei Paschi granted Bank of New York  an indemnity in return for investor approval to change the terms of a 1-billion euro hybrid financial instrument. It did not disclose the indemnity to the Bank of Italy. The Bank of New York did not want to be liable for coupon payments if some of the noteholders refused to agree to the change in the terms of the notes. There is no suggestion in the police documents of any wrongdoing on the part of Bank of New York. But the success of Monte dei Paschi’s bid for Antonveneta rested partly on the deal, known as FRESH 2008, raising the money it needed to acquire Antonveneta. Convertible into Monte dei Paschi shares, the FRESH 2008 notes were sold by U.S. bank JP Morgan to a number of investors, with Bank of New York acting as an intermediary. The Bank of Italy had initially raised objections about the FRESH operation, saying that in its original form it was too similar to a bond, rather than a hybrid equity instrument and could therefore not be counted as core capital, according to Bank of Italy documents seen by Reuters. In an internal email cited in the document, Monte dei Paschi’s then head of treasury and capital management, Massimo Molinari, accused Bank of New York of behaving like “pirates” and complained about having to use “innovative” constructions to help Monte dei Paschi’s capital position. “From my point of view, I assure you I can’t wait for the time when this bank will have such a capital position that it does not need to resort to these innovative ‘legal/financial constructions’, my blood pressure would be better off.” The Bank of Italy demanded changes to ensure that if Monte dei Paschi made no profit, it would not have to pay coupons to JP Morgan or the investors in FRESH 2008. Paying coupons in such a scenario would mean the instrument was more like a bond so that Monte dei Paschi could not count it as core capital. The effort by Bank of New York to seek an indemnity to protect investment returns is not illegal but the internal police documents say that the secret indemnity deal violated the conditions set by the Bank of Italy by placing the financial burden of coupon payments back on Monte dei Paschi rather than JP Morgan or a third party. If proved correct, Monte dei Paschi may not have met the Bank of Italy’s capital requirements and should not have been able to buy Antonveneta. Monte dei Paschi declined to comment. Reuters has not seen the indemnity agreement given to Bank of New York. In his email, Molinari said that the Bank of New York had threatened to suspend a meeting called to approve the changes to the terms of the notes unless they were given an indemnity letter relieving Bank of New York from any obligations towards the note-holders. The financial police allege that Bank of New York made the demand after one of the FRESH 2008 investors, Swiss hedge fund Jabre Capital Partners SA, complained about the changes demanded by the Bank of Italy. A spokesman for Bank of New York in London said: “We understand from recent media coverage that there are ongoing investigations in Italy into the role of MPS (Monte dei Paschi) in the deal. In the circumstances we believe it would be inappropriate to make any statement or comment”. Jabre Capital did not return calls or respond to emails seeking comment. Molinari referred all queries to Monte dei Paschi’s press office, which declined to comment. JP Morgan declined to comment. In a March 12, 2009 email to Raffaele Rizzi, former head of legal compliance at Monte dei Paschi, Molinari describes the indemnity as the “lesser evil” to losing the investment. The email was included in the police report reviewed by Reuters. “Dear Raffaele, I am forwarding for cc the indemnity that in the end I gave to BoNY (Bank of New York),” the e-mail is quoted as saying. “I know you disagreed about the specifics, but at 13:57 with the meeting due at 14:00 and the note-holders already there, BoNY would not start the meeting if this point was not resolved.” “The necessity for indemnities was presented to us only after the Jabre complaints and not as a pre-condition to start the meeting procedure. To hold a meeting hostage seems to me the behaviour of ‘pirates’ rather than professionals.” Molinari continues: “I have judged ... that the ‘lesser evil’ for BMPS (Monte dei Paschi) is the indemnity, given that I would have not been able to obtain the approval of the note-holders on a second occasion.” “I am convinced that giving ‘cover’ to the broker BoNY for those who voted no and for Jabre does not worsen the situation too much for an operation that you already think could give rise to many legal problems.” Rizzi declined to comment. It was not clear if any investor benefited from the alleged indemnity agreement. The Monte dei Paschi foundation, the bank’s biggest shareholder, subscribed to about half of the FRESH 2008 issue, or 490 million euros, running up big debts of its own to do so. Its 2011 accounts show that it booked a loss of 376 million euros on the FRESH operation. A source with direct knowledge of the matter said the foundation had not benefited from the indemnity agreement.",2082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/montepaschi/monte-paschi-struck-secret-deal-over-antonveneta-police-idUSL5N0B888B20130208
209,BK,UPDATE 1-S&P; cuts Jefferson County Alabama underlying ratings,"NEW YORK, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services cut on Friday the underlying ratings on bankrupt Jefferson County, Alabama, to D from C after the decision by the creditors’ trustee, the Bank of New York Mellon, to suspend payment on Feb. 1. The rating agency added that bonds affected are series 1997A, 2001A, 2003-B-8, 2003 B-1-A through series 2003 B-1-E, and series 2003 C-1 through 2003 C-10 sewer system revenue warrants. Moody’s Investors Service, which rates Jefferson County sewer warrants at Caa3 negative, said on Friday that the suspension of payments exposes the warrant holders to greater losses. The ratings agency plans to review the implication of the suspended payments on the current ratings. Out of the total $4.2 billion debt in Jefferson County’s bankruptcy - the largest in the U.S. history - the biggest chunk is represented by $3.14 billion in sewer warrants. When re-marketing this debt failed during the financial crisis, the interest rate that Jefferson County had to pay on these warrants reset to higher penalty rates, Moody’s said. The county defaulted on those warrants first and on other debt, including its fixed rate General Obligation warrants, afterward. Until now, holders of certain bank warrants, “which are on an accelerated repayment schedule and which had principal payments overdue, had consented to the trustee’s making distributions on the Sewer Warrants as if no payment defaults had occurred on the bank warrants,” said Moody’s in its note. Last week, the trustee revealed that some holders of the bank warrants are no longer willing to consent to the trustee making distributions on the Sewer Warrants as if no payment defaults had occurred on the bank warrants. The result is the payment suspension. Earlier this week, the bank of New York Mellon Corp, asked the U.S. bankruptcy court to allow an accelerated payment. The preliminary hearing is set for March 7.",2082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-alabama-jeffco/update-1-sp-cuts-jefferson-county-alabama-underlying-ratings-idUSL1N0B88W420130208
210,BK,Bank of New York loses bid for $900 million tax benefit,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A court on Monday rejected Bank of New York Mellon Corp’s (BK.N) bid to keep $900 million in tax benefits, a decision that could undercut profit at the world’s largest custody bank in 2013. BNY Mellon previously had warned that it may have to book a reserve of more than $800 million if it received an adverse ruling in the high-stakes tax case. Litigation-related reserves typically hit a company’s bottom line. BNY’s case was the first to go to trial since the IRS accused several U.S. banks of generating artificial foreign tax credits. BNY Mellon claimed a benefit that stemmed from a $1.5 billion loan from Barclays Plc (BARC.L), funding so cheap, in fact, that at one point Barclays actually paid BNY Mellon to take Barclays’ money, according to court papers. The Internal Revenue Service , however, denied Bank of New York’s use of foreign tax credits, expense deductions and trust income to lower its tax bill. The company filed a lawsuit against the agency. But the U.S. Tax Court agreed with the IRS, ruling that the transactions lacked “economic substance,” meaning they were done solely for tax purposes. “U.S. tax laws and treaties do not recognize sham transactions or transactions that have no economic substance as valid for tax purposes,” the court said in its opinion. BNY Mellon said it would appeal the decision. “We continue to believe the tax treatment of the transaction was consistent with statutory and judicial authority existing at the time,” BNY Mellon said in a statement. The banks in question used foreign tax credits, which are given to U.S. companies to prevent them from being double-taxed by two countries for the same income. The banks call it a legal funding strategy; the government calls them sham tax shelters.

Still, lawyers on all sides will not have much time to make their case: the New York court has allotted 49 minutes overall for the arguments, up from the 30 minutes originally scheduled. Argentina is seeking the reversal of a November order by U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in Manhattan that required the South American country to pay $1.33 billion into escrow for so-called “holdout” investors when it paid bondholders who participated in the debt restructurings.

215,BK,Bank of NY Mellon to pay $114 million in Medical Capital accord,"(Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Co has agreed to pay $114 million to settle claims over its role as trustee for debt issued by Medical Capital Holdings Inc, a medical receivables financing company that collapsed in 2009 amid fraud allegations. Investors accused Bank of New York Mellon, the world’s largest custodial bank, of failing to properly review Medical Capital’s dealings before letting the company use investors’ money, breaching its fiduciary and contractual obligations to those investors. Medical Capital and two top executives had been sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for fraud in July 2009, and a receiver was appointed the next month. According to court papers, the Tustin, California-based company raised about $1.7 billion from more than 20,000 investors from 2003 until the SEC shut it down. In December 2011, a forensic accounting report from the receiver, Thomas Seaman, estimated Medical Capital investor losses at between $839 million and $1.08 billion, and said the company used a “Ponzi-like scheme” to extract excessive fees. According to papers filed on Thursday with the U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, California, Bank of New York Mellon agreed to settle all claims brought by investors in class-action litigation, two related litigations and the receiver. Investors in the class action would share a $90.68 million cash payment, and their lawyers plan to seek as much as $13.6 million in fees plus $1.8 million for expenses, the papers show. Related class-action litigation against Wells Fargo & Co, also a trustee for some Medical Capital debt, would continue, the papers show. The settlement requires court approval. Bank of New York Mellon denied wrongdoing, but settled to avoid the risks and costs of litigation, court papers show. “We are pleased to be putting this matter behind us,” bank spokesman Kevin Heine said. David Azar, a lawyer for some of the investors, declined to comment. A Wells Fargo spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. One of the Medical Capital executives sued by the SEC, former president Joseph Lampariello, pleaded guilty last May to a related criminal wire fraud charge, court records show.

219,BK,Chesapeake claims right to redeem $1.3 billion in notes,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) filed court papers Friday saying it has the right to redeem $1.3 billion in notes. Chesapeake asked for a declaratory judgment against The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company N.A. to confirm that Chesapeake has the right to redeem the notes. Bank of New York Mellon serves as the indenture trustee for the notes, according to the complaint, filed in Manhattan federal court. “Chesapeake has recently learned that BNY Mellon is operating under the misunderstanding that the deadline for issuing such notice has already passed,” the company’s attorneys wrote in the complaint. In its complaint, Chesapeake said it had until March 15 to notify noteholders of its intention to redeem the notes. The notes have a principal amount of $1.3 billion, an interest rate of 6.775 percent, and are due in 2019, according to the complaint. The bank failed to distinguish the difference between a deadline for when notice must be given and when the redemption date occurs, the complaint said. The Bank of New York Mellon has informed Chesapeake that it “will not cooperate or otherwise participate in the redemption process,” according to the complaint. The bank’s position is that any redemption occurring after March 15 would require Chesapeake “to pay the $400 million make whole to the noteholders.” Should the court not grant the declaratory relief, Chesapeake would have no remedy at law as a result of the bank’s “error,” the complaint said. “Time is of the essence,” the complaint said. “This is not a typical contractual dispute where one party’s misreading of an agreement can be remedied after the fact.” The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Chesapeake and its outgoing CEO Aubrey McClendon for a controversial perk that granted him a share in each of the natural gas producer’s wells.

221,BK,UPDATE 1-Chesapeake claims right to redeem $1.3 billion in notes,"By Bernard Vaughan NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - Chesapeake Energy Corp  filed court papers Friday saying it has the right to redeem $1.3 billion in notes. Chesapeake asked for a declaratory judgment against The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company N.A., the indenture trustee for the notes, to confirm that Chesapeake has the right to redeem them, according to the complaint. “Chesapeake has recently learned that BNY Mellon is operating under the misunderstanding that the deadline for issuing such notice has already passed,” the company’s attorneys wrote in the complaint. Chesapeake, which had $12 billion in long-term liabilities at year-end, said in a statement that its action was “part of a broader refinancing of its outstanding debt obligations.” A combination of low natural gas prices and heavy spending on oil and gas prices has left the company saddled with debt which it has pledged to pay down. In its complaint, Chesapeake said it had until March 15 to notify noteholders of its intention to redeem the notes. The notes have a principal amount of $1.3 billion, an interest rate of 6.775 percent, and are due in 2019, according to the complaint.

The natural gas company, which faces a projected $3 billion cash shortfall this year, is hoping to avoid an extra $400 million of payments on the notes, which carry a 6.775 percent interest rate and mature in 2019. Chesapeake filed a lawsuit last Friday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan seeking to block bond trustee Bank of New York Mellon Corp from interfering with the proposed redemption of the debt at 100 cents on the dollar, or par. But in a court filing on Tuesday, investors who own roughly $250 million of the notes contended that the plan would shortchange them, saying the notes are worth more and that the move would violate Chesapeake’s contractual obligations. Bank of New York Mellon also filed court papers opposing the redemption plan. Jim Gipson, a Chesapeake spokesman, declined to comment. A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon before U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan. Chesapeake has said the proposed redemption is part of a broader plan to refinance its debt. A higher payout would hurt its balance sheet. The 6.775 percent notes traded up 3.1 cents at 106.1 cents on the dollar in morning trading, with a yield of 5.57 percent, according to bond pricing service Trace. Chesapeake shares were down 19 cents at $21.27 on the New York Stock Exchange. The dispute is separate from a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe over a perk that granted Chesapeake’s departing chief executive, Aubrey McClendon, a stake in company wells. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice is examining possible antitrust violations over Chesapeake land transactions in Michigan. Chesapeake is seeking a court order giving it until March 15 to provide investors with notice of its note redemption rights, and a preliminary injunction to block Bank of New York Mellon from interfering. The noteholders, who were not earlier part of the lawsuit, sought to intervene, saying Chesapeake showed an “utter failure to demonstrate any irreparable harm, likelihood of success on its claims, or that the balance of hardships on its motion tip decidedly in Chesapeake’s favor.” In a separate court filing, James Seery, who said he is a partner at noteholder River Birch Capital LLC, said that under the contract, the redemption price should now be about 129 cents on the dollar, not 100 cents. If Chesapeake prevails, even temporarily, “River Birch and the other note holders will suffer material monetary damages,” Seery said. Bank of New York Mellon called the injunction request premature and likely to fail on the merits. “Chesapeake, having missed the deadline to redeem the notes at par, now demands an advisory opinion from the court, seeking to guarantee the idiosyncratic treatment of a future redemption notice which has not been made,” the bank said in its court papers. “Chesapeake has suffered no injury and lacks standing.” The case is Chesapeake Energy Corp. v.

At a hearing on Tuesday evening, U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan said he would rule on the issue from the bench on Thursday at 3 p.m. EDT. Steven Bierman, an attorney for the noteholders, told Engelmayer that Chesapeake was a sophisticated borrower that was trying to rewrite the rules on redeeming the $1.3 billion in notes. “There is no ambiguity here,” Bierman said. “A deal is a deal.” But Engelmayer voiced skepticism with arguments against Chesapeake, saying at one point that, “It looks to me as if (Bank of New York Mellon) and the noteholders are trying to get unjustly rich” from the $400 million payout. Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee of the notes, “has no horse in this race,” Paul Weinstein, an attorney for the bank said.

230,BK,"REFILE-Markit, BNY Mellon bring transparency to tri-party repo","* Repo data, analytics to aid transparency, price discovery * Collateral shortfall looms from regulatory change By Alex Chambers and Helen Bartholomew LONDON, March 19 (IFR) - Markit and BNY Mellon have teamed up to offer securities level data and pricing points in US dollar tri-party repo market, increasing transparency in an opaque but increasingly important financing market. Markit already has an offering on the US$2trn stock lending sector while BNY Mellon Broker Services dominates the US$1trn dollar repo tri-partite market with an 80% market share. The new product consists of security level data, built up from transactional information and includes various aggregated data with standard collateral categories, including Treasuries, ABS and corporate bonds. Tri-partite repo is a key tool allowing broker dealers to finance securities, investors to find securities to hedge positions and for other cash rich parties to lend, but weak infrastructure came to light during the financial crisis. “The regulatory context is that OTC derivatives is undergoing transformational development. And the Fed is pushing for the Tri-partite market to become more diverse and transparent in order to head off potential systemic risk,” said David Carruthers, managing director, Markit Securities Finance. There will be a beta trial over the next few weeks so clients can get to grips with the data, published two days after transaction date. The full launch should happen in early May. Additional transparency generated by the new service could prove a vital part of the solution to an impending collateral crunch that looms as much of the US$639trn OTC derivatives completes the shift into central clearing. New regulations that came into force earlier this month under the Dodd-Frank Act in the US and the EU’s European Markets Infrastructure Regulation require all standardised swaps between financial counterparties to be cleared through CCPs. Repo and collateral transformation are likely to be key markets in meeting some of the shortfall and more timely trade data that will be made available by the new venture should help boost transparency and potentially expand the use of repo as a collateral transformation tool. “Collateral managers now have to decide whether to lend or borrow stock, to repo or reverse repo, and to understand how and when they should post direct to a central counterparty, buy the collateral in market or enter a collateral transformation swap,” said Carruthers. There is very little transparency in repo at present. Markit found with stock loan data that dealers can be surprised about the size and dimensions of the market when transparency was increased in the sector. This innovation will help show what collateral is available and what the rate should be. The development also helps align BNY Mellon with the regulatory backdrop, Fed initiatives and the potential market opportunity from increased transparency. “Knowing where the haircuts and margins are will become increasingly important given the additional collateral requirements, and it should make it easier for counterparties to transform assets into useable collateral,” said one collateral specialist at BNY Mellon. Estimates for the additional collateral requirement stemming from the OTC derivatives clearing mandate vary wildly - from as little as US$100bn according to the IMF, to as much as US$2.6trn according to financial research firm Tabb Group. The actual requirement depends primarily on the impact of netting. A recent study by the Bank of England calculates the collateral requirement associated with OTC derivatives clearing to be anything between US$200bn and US$800bn, primarily dependent on netting. That additional requirement comes at a time when the market for top-rated securities is shrinking as more sovereign issuers lose their Triple A ratings. Currently just 11 sovereign issuers carry a top rating from both Moody’s and S&P.; Last month, Moody’s downgraded the UK to Aa1, stripping it of its Triple A status for the first time in more than 30 years. Markit is building a front-end which it hopes will open up information to a wider group of participants such as collateral managers, money market funds, risk managers and corporate treasurers.",3192013,http://www.reuters.com/article/markit-bny-mellon-repo/refile-markit-bny-mellon-bring-transparency-to-tri-party-repo-idUSL6N0CB8ZC20130319

232,BK,UPDATE 1-Brazil's CAOA says creditor rift likely to sink BVA deal,"* Says Banco BVA could be liquidated ‘anytime’ * Banco BVA was seized by central bank last October SAO PAULO, March 27 (Reuters) - Brazilian entrepreneur Carlos Alberto Oliveira Andrade has failed to get the support of some Banco BVA creditors for his takeover of the bankrupt lender, just hours ahead of a central bank deadline on Wednesday to avert its liquidation. A proposal by Oliveira and his car dealership and financing group, CAOA, to pay bondholders of local and dollar-denominated BVA debt a 65 percent discount for their holdings was rejected by a group of pension and retirement funds represented the local branch of BNY Mellon and Drachma Capital, a CAOA statement said. CAOA said an extension of the deadline was unlikely. “It’s hard to tell whether the negotiations will continue, because Banco BVA could be liquidated in any moment,” the statement said. Brazil’s central bank seized Banco BVA on Oct. 19, citing deteriorating financing conditions and a breach of regulations at the Rio de Janeiro-based lender. Central bank moves to liquidate bankrupt lenders over the past two years have resulted in heavy losses for bondholders, who have repeatedly complained that their claims were treated unequally compared with, for instance, those of state-controlled creditors. Analysts expect the flurry of small-sized bank failures that began in November 2010 with the demise of Banco PanAmericano SA to end with Banco BVA. Lenders such as Banco BVA enjoyed years of boom with the creation of new consumer products in the mid-2000s, but too rapid growth and worsening funding conditions in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis affected their business models. In addition, relaxed credit risk assessments and the inability to cope with tougher auditing controls led PanAmericano, BVA and other rivals to bankruptcy Calls to media representatives of BNY Mellon and Drachma were not immediately answered.",3272013,http://www.reuters.com/article/bancobva-brazil-caoa/update-1-brazils-caoa-says-creditor-rift-likely-to-sink-bva-deal-idUSL2N0CJ1HY20130327

234,BK,U.S. judge rejects defense arguments in BNY Mellon forex case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge said on Thursday he was sympathetic to the U.S. government’s use of a 1989 law against Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) in a lawsuit accusing it of overcharging clients for trading currencies The arguments before U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan were a test of the U.S. Justice Department’s use of a powerful law born out of the savings-and-loan crisis. The law, known as the Financial Institutional Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, is at the heart of a series of civil lawsuits filed in the wake of the recent financial crisis. It is also the core of the lawsuit against BNY Mellon, which had moved to dismiss the case. “I am unpersuaded by the defense arguments on FIRREA, and you can expect I will deny the motion to that extent,” Kaplan said. The judge said he was otherwise reserving a decision on BNY Mellon’s motion to dismiss until a later date. Kevin Heine, a spokesman for BNY Mellon, said in a statement that the bank continues to “believe the lawsuit is without merit.” A spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office brought the case, declined comment. The lawsuit, filed in 2011, accuses BNY Mellon of engaging in a scheme from at least 2000 to defraud custodial customers who used its foreign exchange services. The lawsuit claims the bank misled clients about how it determined currency exchange rates for certain transactions. BNY Mellon reached a partial settlement in January 2012, agreeing to change disclosures it provided about its foreign exchange services. The damages claims continued. The Justice Department is seeking an unspecified amount of penalties. The lawsuit was brought under FIRREA, a 1989 act enacted after the Savings & Loans crisis. The law has a low burden of proof, strong subpoena power and a long 10-year statute of limitations. The Justice Department has asserted that claims under the law in pending lawsuits against Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N). Both are scheduled to argue in April that the claims be dismissed using arguments similar to BNY Mellon. Lawyers with Bharara’s office, which brought all three lawsuits, have sought a broad interpretation of the law, which covers fraud that “affects a federally insured financial institution.” “There clearly is nothing in the legislative history that exempts federally insured financial institutions under FIRREA,” said Pierre Armand, a lawyer for the government. But BNY Mellon has contended the Justice Department was inappropriately seeking to bring claims when the financial institution affected under the prosecutors’ theory was itself. Reid Figel, a lawyer for BNY Mellon, called the government’s use of the law “unprecedented” and said its “plain meaning” meant FIRREA could only apply when a third-party commits a fraud that affects a bank. “Congress clearing intended to limit the kinds of frauds the government could pursue under FIRREA,” Figel said.

237,BK,Chesapeake ex-CEO McClendon to be deposed in bond dispute,"* Bond dispute centers on $400 million payment * Bank of New York modifies position By Bernard Vaughan NEW YORK, April 1 (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp  will depose newly departed Chesapeake Energy Corp  Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon in its dispute with the energy company over a bond redemption, lawyers for both companies said at a hearing in federal court on Monday. Chesapeake last month sued Bank of New York Mellon, the bond trustee for a $1.3 billion debt issue, seeking to block the bank from interfering with Chesapeake’s proposal to redeem the debt at face value. Bank of New York Mellon believes Chesapeake would have to pay noteholders a $400 million make-whole payment because Chesapeake is trying to redeem the notes after a March 15 deadline. The bank believes that McClendon “clearly has knowledge” of Chesapeake’s rationale for redeeming the bonds early, Benjamin Nagin, a lawyer for the bank, said at the hearing in federal court in Manhattan. McClendon’s departure from Chesapeake, which became effective on Monday, is unrelated to the bond dispute. His departure was announced in January after heavy spending on oil and gas properties caused a liquidity crunch and the price of natural gas collapsed. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating a stake in company wells the company granted McClendon. On Friday, Chesapeake appointed its chief operating officer, Steven Dixon, as interim chief executive. Dixon will also serve on a panel to find McClendon’s replacement. U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer, who is overseeing the bond dispute, on Monday expressed skepticism on McClendon’s relevance to the case, given that the trial is due to start  April 23. A lawyer for Chesapeake, Richard Ziegler, said at the hearing, “We’re going to produce him,” referring to McClendon. It is unclear when McClendon would be deposed. A spokesman for Chesapeake did not immediately comment. At the hearing, Steven Bierman, another lawyer for the bank, also modified the bank’s position on the early redemption notice. He said that if Engelmayer finds that the notice was untimely, the bank will not argue that it should trigger the make-whole payment, but would instead simply view the notice as void. “We think that’s a very positive development,” said Ziegler, Chesapeake’s lawyer, at the hearing. Chesapeake believes it only had to notify investors of its plans to redeem the notes by March 15, while Bank of New York argues that the redemption had to take place by that date.

BNY Mellon’s net loss of $266 million, or 23 cents a share, reflected a U.S. Tax Court decision announced in February that triggered a previously announced $854 million charge against profits. In the year-earlier quarter, BNY Mellon reported net income of $619 million, or 52 cents a share. Excluding the tax-related charge, the bank earned 50 cents a share, missing the average analyst estimate by 2 cents, according to I/B/E/S Thomson Reuters. Revenue totaled $3.61 billion, down 1 percent from a year ago. Bright spots included 10 percent gains in both investment management and performance fees, and foreign exchange trading. Net interest revenue at the bank, however, fell 6 percent to $719 million, reflecting lower yields on reinvested securities and the elimination of interest on European Central Bank deposits.

241,BK,"Chesapeake, Bank of New York, square off in bond trial","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chesapeake Energy Corp began an expedited trial on Tuesday against Bank of New York Mellon Corp over the energy company’s effort to redeem $1.3 billion of notes at par. The proceeding in Manhattan federal court comes less than two months after Chesapeake sued the bank, the trustee for the bonds, seeking to prevent it from interfering with the redemption. The dispute is separate from other legal issues involving Chesapeake, the second-largest natural gas producer in the United States. Chesapeake, which faces a projected $3 billion cash shortfall this year, argues that it had until this past March 15 to notify noteholders that it intended to redeem the notes, which have an interest rate of 6.775 percent and mature in 2019, at par. If it is not able to, the company will pay about $100 million in interest, one of its attorneys, Stephen Ascher, said in court on Tuesday. The bank disagrees, arguing that Chesapeake had to complete any par redemption by March 15, and that any redemption thereafter requires it to pay an additional $400 million make-whole payment to investors. The trial is expected to run through early next week. U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer is hearing the case without a jury. At the trial’s start, Ascher said the company’s witnesses will include Chesapeake Chief Financial Officer Domenic Dell’Osso, who helped draft the bond offering. They will testify that it was understood that Chesapeake would have until March 15 to notify investors that it intended to redeem the bonds early, he said. The bank’s case would be based on the argument that Chesapeake’s witnesses do not matter, Ascher told the judge. He said Bank of New York Mellon did not participate in drafting terms of the bond offering and is the only party involved that disputes Chesapeake’s view of the March 15 deadline. “Chesapeake’s interpretation of the text is the only reasonable interpretation,” Ascher said. But Steven Bierman, a lawyer for Bank of New York Mellon, said that Chesapeake’s evidence is irrelevant. There was no understanding between Chesapeake and Bank of New York Mellon that the energy company had only to issue a redemption notice by March 15, he said. Further, there is no written communication that discussed the early redemption period as only requiring notice, Bierman argued. Aubrey McClendon, Chesapeake’s former chief executive officer who had been appointed by the company’s board to oversee pricing of the debt offering, said in a deposition that he “didn’t know anything” about the portion of the contract in question, Bierman said. “March 15 is a bright line between redemption at par and redemption at the make-whole payment,” Bierman said.

243,BK,U.S. can sue BNY Mellon over currency trades: judge,"(Reuters) - A federal judge said on Wednesday the U.S. government can proceed with a lawsuit accusing Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) of overcharging clients for trading currencies, a case brought under a rarely-used financial fraud law. While dismissing some of the fraud claims, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan said the complaint “generally suffices” to let the government pursue its main claim, that the bank fraudulently misrepresented that it would provide “best execution” to various trading clients. The ruling marked a significant victory for the U.S. Department of Justice, which had sought to use a powerful law adopted in the wake of the savings and loan scandals of the 1980s to bring civil fraud cases against Wall Street banks. The law, the Financial Institutional Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), provides for a low burden of proof, strong subpoena power and a 10-year statute of limitations. It had not been applied much until recently. The Justice Department has asserted the law in mortgage-related cases pending against Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N). Those banks have sought to dismiss the claims filed under the law on grounds similar to BNY Mellon. Under the statute, the government may pursue civil penalties against anyone who commits a fraud that is “affecting a federally insured financial institution.” BNY Mellon contended the law shouldn’t apply when the only financial institution affected was itself. In an 81-page opinion, Kaplan rejected that argument, saying that where a financial institution’s fraud harms itself in the process, “it is entirely consistent with the text and purposes of the statute to hold the institution liable for its conduct.” “If anything, the urgency may even be greater when the fraud allegedly pervades an institution that the government has backstopped,” he wrote. Adam Lurie, a former senior official at the Justice Department, now at Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft, said the ruling will make the Justice Department more confident in pursuing cases under FIRREA. “However, they must be mindful that the decision is still subject to review at the appellate level, and the issue is still unsettled at that level,” he added. Filed in 2011, the Justice Department’s lawsuit accuses BNY Mellon of scheming from at least 2000 to defraud custodial customers of its foreign exchange services. The lawsuit claims BNY Mellon misled clients about how it arrived at its foreign currency exchange rates for certain transactions. BNY Mellon entered into a partial settlement in January 2012, agreeing to change disclosures regarding its foreign exchange services. The damages claims continued. The lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount of penalties. On the merits of the case, Kaplan said on Wednesday the complaint sufficiently alleged its principal claims that it took steps to actively mislead clients about how foreign currency trades were priced. He also said the complaint sufficiently alleged fraud claims against an individual defendant in the case, David Nichols, the head of products management at BNY Mellon. Stephen Fishbein, a lawyer for Nichols at Shearman & Sterling, declined comment. Kevin Heine, a spokesman for BNY Mellon, said the bank was “pleased that the court dismissed a number of the claims advanced by the government.” The judge dismissed some claims in the lawsuit to the extent it alleged BNY Mellon made misrepresentations by saying it minimizes costs or provides the “best rate of the day,” among other claims. “We look forward to addressing the remaining claims before the court,” Heine said. A spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office filed the case, declined comment. The case is United States v.

While dismissing some of the fraud claims, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan said the complaint “generally suffices” to let the government pursue its main claim, that the bank fraudulently misrepresented that it would provide “best execution” to various trading clients. The ruling marked a significant victory for the U.S. Department of Justice, which had sought to use a powerful law adopted in the wake of the savings and loan scandals of the 1980s to bring civil fraud cases against Wall Street banks. The law, the Financial Institutional Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), provides for a low burden of proof, strong subpoena power and a 10-year statute of limitations. It had not been applied much until recently. The Justice Department has asserted the law in mortgage-related cases pending against Bank of America Corp  and Wells Fargo & Co. Those banks have sought to dismiss the claims filed under the law on grounds similar to BNY Mellon. Under the statute, the government may pursue civil penalties against anyone who commits a fraud that is “affecting a federally insured financial institution.” BNY Mellon contended the law shouldn’t apply when the only financial institution affected was itself. In an 81-page opinion, Kaplan rejected that argument, saying that where a financial institution’s fraud harms itself in the process, “it is entirely consistent with the text and purposes of the statute to hold the institution liable for its conduct.” “If anything, the urgency may even be greater when the fraud allegedly pervades an institution that the government has backstopped,” he wrote. Adam Lurie, a former senior official at the Justice Department, now at Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft, said the ruling will make the Justice Department more confident in pursuing cases under FIRREA. “However, they must be mindful that the decision is still subject to review at the appellate level, and the issue is still unsettled at that level,” he added. Filed in 2011, the Justice Department’s lawsuit accuses BNY Mellon of scheming from at least 2000 to defraud custodial customers of its foreign exchange services. The lawsuit claims BNY Mellon misled clients about how it arrived at its foreign currency exchange rates for certain transactions. BNY Mellon entered into a partial settlement in January 2012, agreeing to change disclosures regarding its foreign exchange services. The damages claims continued. The lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount of penalties. On the merits of the case, Kaplan said on Wednesday the complaint sufficiently alleged its principal claims that it took steps to actively mislead clients about how foreign currency trades were priced. He also said the complaint sufficiently alleged fraud claims against an individual defendant in the case, David Nichols, the head of products management at BNY Mellon. Stephen Fishbein, a lawyer for Nichols at Shearman & Sterling, declined comment. Kevin Heine, a spokesman for BNY Mellon, said the bank was “pleased that the court dismissed a number of the claims advanced by the government.” The judge dismissed some claims in the lawsuit to the extent it alleged BNY Mellon made misrepresentations by saying it minimizes costs or provides the “best rate of the day,” among other claims. “We look forward to addressing the remaining claims before the court,” Heine said. A spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office filed the case, declined comment. The case is United States v.

247,BK,"Chesapeake, Bank of New York wrap up trial over bond redemption","* Chesapeake sought bond redemption at par * Trustee says energy company missed deadline * Manhattan federal judge hears arguments without a jury By Bernard Vaughan NEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - Chesapeake Energy Corp  and Bank of New York Mellon concluded an expedited trial on Tuesday over the energy company’s effort to redeem $1.3 billion notes at par. U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan, who is hearing the case without a jury, did not issue an immediate ruling. Chesapeake, which faces a projected $3 billion cash shortfall this year, sued Bank of New York, the trustee for the bonds, on March 8. The dispute is centered around a few short paragraphs in the offering contract for the bonds. The natural gas producer has argued that it had until March 15 to notify investors that it intended to redeem the bonds, which have an interest rate of 6.775 percent and mature in 2019, at par under an early redemption provision in the bond contract. Bank of New York Mellon, however, said Chesapeake had to have completed the redemption by March 15, and that any redemption thereafter would require a $400 million payment to investors. Witnesses for Chesapeake, including its Chief Financial Officer Domenic Dell’Osso, testified during a trial that started April 23 that the drafters of the contract had understood that March 15 was a notice deadline. The company also sought to play down Bank of New York’s role as one of an administrator that wasn’t involved in negotiating terms or drafting the contract. In his closing argument on Tuesday, Chesapeake lawyer Richard Ziegler called Bank of New York Mellon’s position “absurd” and “patently unreasonable.” “It simply doesn’t compute,” Ziegler said. But how Chesapeake and the underwriter for the offering viewed the March 15 deadline was less important than how Bank of New York understood it as the trustee of the bonds, Steven Bierman, a lawyer for the bank, told Engelmayer. He also argued that the testimony of the four witnesses was unreliable and should not factor in the judge’s decision. “ should have gotten it right, they should have been clear,” Bierman said. “It’s on them if it’s unclear, ultimately.” The lawsuit is separate from other legal matters Chesapeake is facing, including a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe into a perk granting former CEO Aubrey McClendon a stake in company wells and a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into possible antitrust violations in Michigan land deals.

248,BK,Chesapeake wins bond dispute with Bank of NY Mellon,"(Reuters) - Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) won the right to redeem $1.3 billion of notes early, as a federal judge rejected an argument by the notes’ trustee, Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), that the company waited too long to tell investors of its plans. Chesapeake, the No. 2 U.S. natural gas company, said it intends to refinance the notes, and that Wednesday’s decision by U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan will save it more than $100 million in interest payments. That could ease Chesapeake’s debt burden and other strains exacerbated by the lowest natural gas prices in a decade. Engelmayer ruled that Chesapeake’s March 15 notice to redeem the 6.775 percent notes, which would have matured in 2019, did not come too late. He rejected the contention by Bank of New York Mellon that Chesapeake had missed a deadline a month earlier. The redemption price for the notes was 100 cents on the dollar plus interest. “Chesapeake’s notice was effective, not defective,” and the bank’s interpretation of the bond documents was “tortured and incoherent,” Engelmayer wrote in a 92-page decision. The evidence “convincingly establishes a meeting of the minds among the negotiating parties as to the deadlines,” he added. “These parties intended and agreed that March 15, 2013, would serve as the deadline for Chesapeake to give notice.” Engelmayer held a week-long trial in late April, and ruled before the scheduled May 13 redemption date. Bank of New York Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine declined to comment on the decision, and said the bank will continue to represent bondholders’ interests. Domenic Dell’Osso, Chesapeake’s chief financial officer, in a statement said he was pleased with the decision. By early afternoon, the price of the Chesapeake notes had tumbled 7 cents on the dollar to 100.5 cents, with the yield rising to 6.67 percent from 5.27 percent, according to bond pricing service Trace. Shares of Chesapeake rose 21 cents to $19.34 in early-afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Investors favoring the bank’s view included Archer Capital Management LP, Ares Management LLC, Aurelius Capital Management LP, Carlson Capital LP, Cetus Capital LLC, Latigo Partners LLC, Monarch Alternative Capital LP, P. Schoenfeld Asset Management LP, River Birch Capital LLC and Taconic Capital Advisors LP. Chesapeake has been cutting spending and focusing more on drilling its best properties after former Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon spent heavily and took on more debt to amass large acreage positions in U.S. shale basins. The Oklahoma City-based company plans to sell as much as $7 billion of assets, but faces a $3.5 billion gap this year between estimated cash flow and capital expenses. It ended the first quarter with $13.4 billion of long-term debt. Chesapeake also faces other legal issues. These include probes by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission into a perk that gave McClendon a stake in company wells, and by the U.S. Department of Justice into possible antitrust violations over Michigan land deals. McClendon stepped down as chief executive on April 1 and was succeeded on an interim basis by Steve Dixon. Chesapeake’s board has also been overhauled, with several directors installed by large investors, including Carl Icahn and Mason Hawkins of Southeastern Asset Management.

251,BK,Bank of NY Mellon appeals ruling on Chesapeake bond lawsuit,"May 13 (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp is appealing against a district court judgment that allowed Chesapeake Energy Corp to redeem $1.3 billion of notes six years before their maturity date, a court filing showed. Last week, U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan ruled that Chesapeake’s March 15 notice to redeem the 6.775 percent notes, which would have matured in 2019, did not come too late. He rejected the contention by Bank of New York Mellon that Chesapeake had missed a deadline a month earlier. The redemption price for the notes was 100 cents on the dollar plus interest. The dispute flared when Chesapeake, hoping to take advantage of lower interest rates, decided to call the bonds six years earlier than the maturity date to avoid millions of dollars in extra payments. Bank of New York Mellon, trustee of the notes, opposed the redemption, saying the No. 2 U.S. natural gas company waited too long to tell investors of its plans. Chesapeake complained that Bank of New York Mellon failed to distinguish between a deadline for when notice must be given and when the redemption date occurs. After last week’s court victory, Chesapeake said it intends to refinance the notes and that decision by Judge Engelmayer will save it more than $100 million in interest payments. A notice of Bank of New York Mellon’s appeal was filed on May 11. The appeal will be heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, according to a filing.

252,BK,Bank of America $8.5 billion mortgage settlement case opens,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) proposed $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage securities that went bad during the financial crisis offers billions more than they are likely to get if they go to trial, a lawyer for the trustee who helped negotiate the deal argued Monday. Matthew Ingber, a lawyer for Bank of New York Mellon, the trustee overseeing the securities, made the case for the deal as a long-awaiting proceeding for approval of the settlement got underway in state court in New York. Bank of America agreed to the settlement in June 2011 to resolve the claims of investors in bonds issued by mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp, which Bank of America bought in 2008. Twenty-two institutional investors, including BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), MetLife Inc (MET.N) and Allianz SE’s (ALVG.DE) Pacific Investment Management Co entered into the settlement. American International Group Inc (AIG.N) and others have objected, saying the settlement offered them only a fraction of the money they lost. Bank of New York Mellon, as the trustee, is asking a New York state court to approve the settlement and make it binding on all the investors. In court on Monday, Ingber said Countrywide had a maximum of $4.8 billion in assets to pay a judgment on the claims. If the settlement is not approved, investors probably won’t be able to hold Bank of America responsible for misrepresentations made by Countrywide on the quality of the underlying mortgages, he said. “You may hear a lot from the objectors about what the trustee should have done or could have done or might have done,” Ingber told Justice Barbara Kapnick, who must decide whether to approve the deal. “But, your honor, all those coulda, woulda, shoulda are irrelevant if the pot of gold isn’t going to be there.” Opening arguments are set to continue on Tuesday, with Texas attorney Kathy Patrick making the case for the institutional investors who support the settlement. The opponents are expected to argue that losses to the trusts might exceed $100 billion. They claim BNY Mellon placed its interests and those of Bank of America above those of bond holders. And they point out BNY Mellon gets trust business from Bank of America. Colorado attorney Dan Reilly, who represents AIG, said last week the proposed deal “offers pennies on the dollar” to the bond holders. A lawyer for the federal home loan banks of Boston, Indianapolis and Chicago is expected to join AIG in an opening statement on behalf of the objectors on Tuesday. Ingber argued Monday that the trustee did not receive any money or a release of claims in the settlement agreement. He told Kapnick the questions she had to answer were whether the trustee entered into the deal in good faith and whether the settlement was reasonable. “This was an easy call and it was done for all the right reasons,” Ingber said. “Approval of this settlement is a win for all investors.” Kapnick has set aside the first two weeks of June to hear the case. She said that because of other cases, she will then recess until July. A ruling could take months after the trial is completed.

254,BK,Bank of America $8.5 billion settlement heads for court showdown,"* Case involves Countrywide mortgage securities * Trustee BNY Mellon to present case for deal approval * Investors including BlackRock, Pimco support accord * AIG, Federal Home Loan banks call settlement inadequate By Karen Freifeld NEW YORK, June 3 (Reuters) - A long-running fight comes to a head on Monday when court proceedings begin over an $8.5 billion settlement between Bank of America Corp and investors in mortgage securities that turned sour in the financial crisis. Bank of America agreed to the proposed settlement in June 2011 to resolve claims by investors who held bonds issued by mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp, which Bank of America bought in 2008. Twenty-two institutional investors, including BlackRock Inc , MetLife Inc and Allianz SE’s Pacific Investment Management Co entered into the deal. But American International Group Inc and others objected, saying the settlement offered them only a fraction of the money they lost. Justice Barbara Kapnick of New York State Supreme Court, who  will decide the case without a jury, has set aside the first two weeks of June to hear the case. If she rejects the settlement, the parties could face years of litigation. Kathy Patrick, who will argue for the institutional investors who negotiated the deal, said objectors comprise only seven percent of certificate-holders. “There is massive support for this settlement,” Patrick said in arguments during a last-minute appeal last week. The proposed deal “offers pennies on the dollar,” Colorado attorney Daniel Reilly, who represents AIG, said during last week’s arguments. Over 20 AIG entities and the home loan banks of Boston, Indianapolis and Chicago are among 65 opponents of the settlement, he said. The opponents say losses to the trusts might exceed $100 billion, according to court papers. They claim BNY Mellon placed its interests and those of Bank of America above certificate- holders. They point out BNY Mellon gets trust business from the bank. The case was filed by Bank of New York Mellon, the trustee for some 530 trusts that held the securities, asking the court to approve the settlement and declare it binding on all beneficiaries. Matthew Ingber, who represents BNY Mellon, is expected to argue the trustee has the right to settle claims and exercised good faith judgment in deciding the settlement was reasonable. “We believe this $8.5 billion settlement is in the best interests of all the certificate-holders,” Ingber said during  last week’s appeal. In the two years since it was filed, the case has been a frenzy of activity. An investor group that opposed the settlement, led by  Boston-based Baupost Group, moved the case to federal court in the hope of getting a higher payout. The attorneys general of New York and Delaware voiced their opposition to the deal and New York accused trustee BNY Mellon of fraud. Then the pendulum swung in the other direction. A U.S. appeals court sent the case back to state court, Baupost, operating under the name Walnut Place, withdrew its objections and New York dropped the fraud claims. Last month, the two attorneys general also withdrew their objections to the deal. A ruling could take months after the trial is completed.

261,BK,NYC funds pick State Street to replace BNY Mellon after FX flap,"BOSTON (Reuters) - New York City pension funds have picked State Street Corp (STT.N) to safeguard $137 billion, replacing incumbent Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), which was accused in 2011 of overcharging the funds on foreign currency trades. New York City Comptroller John Liu on Friday announced Boston-based State Street as the next master custodian for the five pension funds. The deal is pending successful contract negotiations. Liu also said State Street’s proposal will increase audit transparency and modernize reconciliation capabilities for more than 2,000 accounts held by the five New York city pension funds. The conversion is set to happen in the fall of 2013 after BNY Mellon’s contract as the pension funds’ custody bank expires. Liu, in a statement, said State Street’s bid was the lowest cost proposal among bidders. A spokesman for Liu declined to say whether BNY Mellon bid on the contract. BNY Mellon also declined to comment. BNY Mellon is the world’s largest custody bank, overseeing $26.2 trillion in assets under custody and administration. In 2011, New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and the city of New York accused BNY Mellon of overcharging on forex trades over a 10-year period. Instead of providing the best interbank rates - as it promised - NY Mellon gave the worst or nearly the worst rates of the trading day, according to their civil complaint. BNY Mellon has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing. At the time of the complaint, Schneiderman’s office said it was seeking to recover $2 billion nationwide. New York City pension funds were among the hardest hit and lost tens of millions of dollars as a result of forex trades executed by BNY Mellon, according to Schneiderman’s complaint.

262,BK,BNY Mellon must face NY lawsuit over foreign exchange rates -judge,"* NY judge refuses to dismiss fraud claims against BNY Mellon * NY attorney general brought case in 2011 * Attorney general claims BNY Mellon earned $2 bln through rate fraud By Karen Freifeld NEW YORK, Aug 6 (Reuters) - A $2 billion lawsuit brought by New York’s attorney general accusing Bank of New York Mellon of overcharging clients for foreign exchange transactions can proceed, a state judge has ruled. The ruling by Justice Marcy Friedman, which was made public on Tuesday, cleared a major hurdle for the lawsuit, one of several brought by state and federal authorities over foreign currency transactions. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued BNY Mellon in 2011, saying the bank of giving customers “the worst price” of the trading day rather than market price at the time of the trade. The lawsuit accused the bank of fraudulent misrepresentation for saying it would provide the best execution to its clients, which included New York city pension funds. BNY Mellon earned $2 billion between 2001 and 2011 through the practice, the lawsuit said. A spokesman said the bank would “vigorously defend” itself against the lawsuit. “Today’s decision allows my office to proceed in seeking $2 billion for retirees and scores of private investors nationwide who were ripped off by Bank of New York Mellon,” Schneiderman said in a statement. Other states, along with federal authorities, have brought similar cases against BNY Mellon, Boston-based State Street Corp and other banks. A 2011 lawsuit against BNY filed by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara also is pending. In her decision, Friedman let stand claims Schneiderman brought under the Martin Act, New York’s powerful securities fraud statute, despite arguments by BNY Mellon that that the statute did not apply to spot sales of foreign currencies. Friedman also allowed some claims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract. She threw out a claim for unjust enrichment, as well as whistleblower claims alleging violations of New York’s False Claims Act. “We are pleased that the New York court has dismissed the whistleblower claims which, like similar False Claims Act dismissals in other states, demonstrates that such claims have no legal merit,” BNY Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine said. “We continue to believe the remaining claims are unwarranted.” Last year, Virginia dismissed a similar lawsuit after that state’s attorney general intervened in a whistleblower case. A California court also threw out certain claims in a case there filed under that state’s False Claims Act. The bank had said it accurately reported the actual exchange rates through trade confirmations and account statements. In April, a federal judge allowed the Manhattan U.S. Attorney lawsuit against BNY Mellon over similar allegations to proceed, though it held the “best rate of day” representation was insufficient to support a fraud claim. BNY Mellon entered into a partial settlement in that case in January 2012, agreeing to change disclosures regarding its foreign exchange services. The damages claims continued. Meantime, another lawsuit accusing JPMorgan Chase & Co. of breaching its fiduciary to custodial clients by charging “hidden and excessive mark-ups” on currency trades was dismissed last month. The New York City pension funds will replace Bank of New York Mellon with State State Corp as custodian when BNY Mellon’s contract expires this fall. BNY Mellon is the world’s largest custody bank, overseeing $26.2 trillion in assets under custody and administration. The case is People of the State of New York v.

263,BK,Court reverses ruling on Sentinel loan in blow to BNY Mellon,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) may have to get in line behind former customers of Sentinel Management Group who are seeking to recoup money lost in the futures broker’s 2007 collapse, a U.S. appeals court ruled on Monday. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago reversed part of a ruling by U.S. District Judge James Zagel and said he must revisit the case. Zagel had previously put the bank ahead of Sentinel’s former clients. If Zagel agrees with the appeals court’s decisions, the bank may have to return about $312 million to Sentinel’s bankruptcy trustee for distribution to former clients, according to a lawyer for trustee Frederick Grede. Monday’s decision is a “big victory for the protection of customers and customer funds,” Grede said. Sentinel was based in a Chicago suburb. Kevin Heine, a spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon, said the bank had no immediate comment. Sentinel largely managed money for other futures brokers, delivering outsized returns that Grede said were boosted by improperly using customer money to secure loans that funded risky trades. The scheme unraveled when the credit crisis began in the summer of 2007. Grede alleged that the broker pledged hundreds of millions of dollars in customer assets to secure an overnight loan at Bank of New York Mellon, leaving the bank in a secured position but Sentinel’s customers with losses of millions. Futures brokers are required to keep customers’ funds in dedicated accounts to protect them from being used for anything other than client business. At Sentinel, customer funds were allegedly moved from the protected accounts to other accounts so they could be used as collateral for loans to Sentinel’s own trading operations. Former customers of the firm have received back about 35 percent of the $600 million that was missing when Sentinel collapsed, said Chris Gair, a lawyer for the trustee. The appeals court’s decision shows that the requirement to keep customer funds segregated “really has teeth,” he said. Since Sentinel’s collapse, the futures industry has been rattled by the bankruptcies of two more brokers: MF Global in 2011 and Peregrine Financial Group in 2012. The heads of both firms were alleged to have improperly used customer money. The case is Frederick Grede v. Bank of New York Mellon Corp., in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, no. 10-3787.

264,BK,BNY Mellon gets $10 billion in deposits amid U.S. shutdown,"(Reuters) - BNY Mellon Corp’s (BK.N) top executives said on Wednesday that clients had started to flood the trust and custody bank with billions of dollars of deposits as they worry about the effects of the U.S. government shutdown. The bank’s balance sheet has increased by about $10 billion in October, showing how clients are parking more cash, Chairman Gerald Hassell said on a conference call. BNY Mellon, like other trust and custody banks, manages cash for companies and handles back-office processing of securities and banking transaction for fund managers, among its other businesses. The bank does not have retail branches. Recent client behavior is reminiscent of what happened in the summer of 2011, when investors worried about the Greek debt crisis and an earlier stalemate in Washington over the U.S. debt ceiling, BNY Mellon Chief Financial Officer Todd Gibbons told Reuters. At the end of 2011, noninterest-bearing deposits at the bank surged to $80 billion, or nearly double the amount reported earlier that year. Such deposits totaled $72.1 billion at the end of September and surged in early October. “There’s a lot of conversion into cash,” Gibbons said after the bank reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit. But stocks rose on Wednesday amid cautious optimism that U.S. politicians would strike a last-minute deal to prevent the country from defaulting on its debt. If a deal materializes, investors would probably rotate cash holdings into stocks and bonds. BNY Mellon shares were up 0.5 percent at $31 at midday. The stock has risen 32 percent over the past 12 months. The world’s largest custody bank by assets said it had earned $967 million, or 82 cents a share, in the third quarter, compared with $720 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier. Without a benefit from a U.S. Tax Court decision, earnings were 60 cents a share. Still, that beat the analysts’ average estimate of 58 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Investment services fees rose 4 percent to $1.7 billion, partly reflecting higher mutual fund and asset-based fees. Investment management and performance fees rose 5 percent from year-earlier levels to $821 million. The gains stemmed from new business and a rising stock market in the third quarter. Foreign exchange revenue surged 27 percent to $154 million on higher volumes and volatility.

265,BK,Fitch: BNY Mellon's 3Q13 Core Earnings Flat on Lower Seasonal Revenue,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 23 (Fitch) The Bank of New York Mellon (BK) reported 3Q13 net  income of $967 million on slightly lower revenue. Net income was aided by a $261  million partial reversal of a 1Q13 charge related to foreign tax credits.  Adjusting for this charge, net income would have been $706 million and slightly  down from 2Q13. The sequential revenue decline is partly attributed to seasonal  factors. BK has largely been able to control expenses, with staff expenses  coming in at a steady 40% of total revenue.     Overall fee revenues were down 7% sequentially owing to seasonal factors,  although fee revenues did show growth on a year-on-year basis. Asset Servicing  revenues declined 2% on a sequential basis due to lower securities lending  activity. Investment management fees were similarly down on a sequential basis  due to seasonal factors and higher money market fee waivers vs. prior periods.  Assets under Custody and Administration (AUC/A) showed solid growth of 5% to  $27.4 trillion from a combination of net new business and higher market values.  Although new business flows came in at $110 billion for the quarter, this was  down from 2Q13's $201 billion.   NII and NIM remained relatively flat to 2Q13, although benefitted from lower  premium amortization on investment securities and higher average earning assets.  Fitch continues to view BK's NII and NIM at cyclical lows and thus should  improve if and when short-term rates increase. BK also recorded a gain of $22  million as it reduced the size of the investment securities portfolio and  reclassified $7 billion of mortgage-backed securities to held-to-maturity from  available-for-sale. This is meant to insulate capital from losses under rising  rates as these will flow to other comprehensive income which will be deducted  from regulatory capital.    BK reported Basel III Tier 1 Common (T1C) ratio under both the standardized and  advanced approaches. Under the standardized approach, T1C was 10.1%, while under  the advanced approach, it was 11.1%. Fitch considers risk-weighted capital  measures as comfortable under either approach, as these are in excess of  regulatory minimums inclusive of additional buffers. BK also disclosed its  supplemental leverage ratio at the holding company of 4.3%. Although below  proposed standards currently under consideration, Fitch considers that BK has  adequate levers to comply, particularly given its strong capital generation.  Contact:  Christopher D.

273,BK,BNY Mellon cuts fees to settle Massachusetts forex case,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp will cut fees by $15.45 million to resolve a Massachusetts complaint over its handling of foreign exchange transactions, state officials said on Monday. The deal resolves an October 2011 administrative complaint and is the only latest agreement by the bank with officials in various states who have probed its forex practices. BNY Mellon continues to face scrutiny in the area, however, including lawsuits brought by New York’s attorney general and the Manhattan U.S. Attorney. The $15.45 million is the discount that BNY Mellon agreed to provide over nine years on the custodial services fees it charges to Massachusetts’ Pension Reserves Investment Management Board (PRIM), which oversees public retirement money, according to Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin. In order to resolve the administrative complaint, the bank was also charged $100,000 for the cost of the investigation, Galvin said, and it agreed to change some forex trading procedures and policies. In an interview, Galvin called the agreement a good result, especially as PRIM wanted to continue doing business with BNY Mellon. In a separate statement, Massachusetts Treasurer Steven Grossman, who chairs the PRIM board, said the deal followed months of negotiations and drew on an independent audit of BNY Mellon’s trades. BNY Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine said, “We are pleased to reach this commercial agreement with PRIM, which allows us to continue our long-standing relationship with them.” The company continues to defend itself against the claims in New York, he said. BNY and its rival State Street Corp have been under pressure since private lawsuits emerged three years ago charging them with misleading clients about their forex fees. State charges followed soon after including one in October 2011 in which Galvin alleged that BNY Mellon was improperly collecting the differences between the foreign-exchange prices it charged clients and the actual prices that BNY obtained for itself on markets. BNY Mellon has been able to resolve some of the suits since then such as a $28 million deal reached with Florida officials in November. PRIM said it will pay $750,000 to the whistleblower who originally called attention to the alleged overcharges. Its press release did not identify this person, but court filings show him to be former BNY Mellon trader Grant Wilson, who has been involved in other state cases as well. Wilson’s attorney, Philip Michael, declined to comment.

BNY Mellon continues to face scrutiny in the area, however, including lawsuits brought by New York’s attorney general and the Manhattan U.S. Attorney. The $15.45 million is the discount that BNY Mellon agreed to provide over nine years on the custodial services fees it charges to Massachusetts’ Pension Reserves Investment Management Board (PRIM), which oversees public retirement money, according to Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin. In order to resolve the administrative complaint, the bank was also charged $100,000 for the cost of the investigation, Galvin said, and it agreed to change some forex trading procedures and policies. In an interview, Galvin called the agreement a good result, especially as PRIM wanted to continue doing business with BNY Mellon. In a separate statement, Massachusetts Treasurer Steven Grossman, who chairs the PRIM board, said the deal followed months of negotiations and drew on an independent audit of BNY Mellon’s trades. BNY Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine said, “We are pleased to reach this commercial agreement with PRIM, which allows us to continue our long-standing relationship with them.” The company continues to defend itself against the claims in New York, he said. BNY and its rival State Street Corp have been under pressure since private lawsuits emerged three years ago charging them with misleading clients about their forex fees. State charges followed soon after including one in October 2011 in which Galvin alleged that BNY Mellon was improperly collecting the differences between the foreign-exchange prices it charged clients and the actual prices that BNY obtained for itself on markets. BNY Mellon has been able to resolve some of the suits since then such as a $28 million deal reached with Florida officials in November. PRIM said it will pay $750,000 to the whistleblower who originally called attention to the alleged overcharges. Its press release did not identify this person, but court filings show him to be former BNY Mellon trader Grant Wilson, who has been involved in other state cases as well. Wilson’s attorney, Philip Michael, declined to comment.

288,BK,Bank of New York Mellon reports first-quarter profit,"(Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) reported a first-quarter profit on Tuesday as rising markets drove up its assets under custody and administration. The large New York trust bank reported net income of $661 million, or 57 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $266 million, or 23 cents per share, on a charge from a tax ruling. Analysts on average expected a profit of 53 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Assets under custody and/or administration were $27.9 trillion on March 31, the bank said, up 6 percent from a year earlier. Shares of BNY Mellon were down 0.3 percent at $33.60 in early trading. With its stock lagging that of rival State Street Corp (STT.N) in recent years, BNY Mellon has been under pressure to control costs. Reviewing the quarter, analysts gave mixed reviews because of factors like a decline in revenue from foreign exchange trading, and low interest rates overall. “While expense control is a positive, environmental revenue headwinds seem relentless,” Sandler O’Neill analyst Jeffrey Harte wrote in a note to investors. Speaking on a conference call with investors Tuesday morning, executives reviewed plans to control technology spending, such as by changing the ways the bank develops applications, and to address real estate expenses. For instance, BNY Mellon is selling its headquarters building at 1 Wall Street in New York, and Chief Financial Officer Todd Gibbons said the sale could take place by the end of September. “We are taking aggressive action in virtually every expense category,” Chief Executive Officer Gerald Hassell said on the call.

300,BK,BNY Mellon to U.S. judge: What should we do with Argentina's money?,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon, fearful of being sued by Argentine bondholders and unwilling to defy a court order blocking their coupon payments, will seek guidance from U.S. Judge Thomas Griesa on what to do with the money, a source said on Wednesday. “Following an exchange of letters today, the court asked BNY Mellon to make a formal motion asking for clarification on what actions it should take with the money that the government deposited in its account at the Central Bank of Argentina last week,” said a source with direct knowledge of the situation. “The bank is asking Griesa, essentially, how can it get from point A to point B without being sued.” The motion needs to be filed by July 8, the source said.  BNY Mellon received a deposit of $539 million on June 26 in defiance of Griesa’s order that said the Argentine government had to pay bondholders who accepted sovereign debt restructurings in 2005 and 2010 at the same time it paid investors who held out from the exchanges and won a court-awarded $1.33 billion plus accrued interest. Argentina has until the end of the month to strike a deal with the holdouts. If it fails, the country risks tumbling into its second sovereign debt crisis in 12 years. The government wants the payment it made unfrozen as a condition for negotiating.  Griesa, in a hearing on June 27, said the money should be returned to Argentina, “simple as that,” but gave no instructions.  BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custody bank, has told Griesa it has done nothing with the money because it is following his orders and will maintain the status quo, thereby leaving the cash in limbo. Holdout investor Aurelius Capital Management asked Griesa on Wednesday to file an order directing BNY Mellon to return the money to Argentina. Aurelius and Elliott Management Corp are two hedge funds that specialize in buying up deeply discounted or distressed debt and negotiating profitable settlements, often through the use of the courts. Their case was upheld on appeal. BNY Mellon sent a letter to the judge saying it cannot return the money without wire transfer orders from Argentina. The government claims the cash now belongs to holders of its restructured bonds. The source said BNY Mellon was being threatened with lawsuits by holders of euro-denominated Argentine bonds for not making the required payment that was originally due June 30. This set of investors contend their bonds are governed by laws of England and Wales and at no point are payments processed through the United States or in U.S. dollars and therefore should not be subject to Griesa’s jurisdiction. Griesa denied this group a request for exemption from the injunction on June 27, saying Argentina submitted to the jurisdiction of the court when it originally sold the bonds and therefore, so would its payments. The government is sending a team to New York on July 7 to set conditions for talks by way of a court-appointed mediator.

305,BK,Argentine bondholders given instructions by BNY Mellon,"NEW YORK, July 31 (Reuters) - In the wake of Argentina’s July 30 default on restructured sovereign debt, Bank of New York Mellon on Thursday gave instructions to creditors for the next step in exercising their rights to collect on their investments. In a statement, BNY Mellon said bondholders “shall have the right to direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee by the Indenture with respect to the Debt Securities of such Series.” Argentina and the holdout creditors, who did not participate in the two prior restructurings of the country’s 2002 default on approximately $100 billion, failed to come to agreement to avert a repeat default by July 30 despite weeks of talks. Holders of at least 25 percent of the restructured debt from 2005 and 2010 must now give written notice to both Argentina and the trustee to declare the debt securities are “immediately due and payable.” This is known as acceleration. The default is a set back to Latin America’s No. 3 economy from efforts this year to re-engage with international financial markets.

306,BK,BNY confirms still holding Argentina bond monies,"NEW YORK, July 31 (IFR) - Bank of New York Mellon (BNY) sent a formal letter Thursday to holders of Argentina’s exchange bonds essentially confirming that the sovereign had defaulted. The letter confirmed that BNY, acting as trustee, was still holding the funds that would have covered the payment due by July 30 in the wake of a US court order not to release the funds. That order came from Judge Thomas Griesa, who ordered Argentina to pay holdout creditors in full when it made its next payment to holders of the exchange, or restructured, bonds. “Pursuant to the court’s earlier orders, the trustee continues to hold the funds,” said the letter, which was seen by IFR. “The funds are held pending any further court order. The nature and timing of any future court order regarding the funds are not yet known.” Argentina slipped into its second default since 2001 when the midnight Wednesday deadline to make the payment to the exchange holders passed without payment being made.

The bank’s Brazilian fund manager BNY Mellon DTVM said in a filing on Monday that the Brasil Sovereign II Fundo de Investimento de Divida Externa (FIDEX) had invested in credit-linked notes under previous management in 2011. “We inform that due to the suspension of payments on foreign debt notes issued by Argentina that backed those notes and the need to change the evaluation methodology for some private debt notes in FIDEX’s portfolio, provisions for losses have been made on Aug. 1,” the filing said. According to Brazil’s Securities and Exchange Commission CVM website, the fund’s assets fell to 180.5 million reais ($79 million) reais on Aug. 1 from 378.4 million reais the previous day, a 52 percent drop.

308,BK,Italian holdouts in Argentina debt dispute make play for cash,"NEW YORK, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Italian retirees holding defaulted Argentine debt from 2002 and who spurned Buenos Aires’ restructuring offers are seeking to force Bank of New York Mellon to pay out their court judgments from frozen money due holders who accepted the government’s terms. In a further twist in the long-running sovereign debt dispute that has pushed Argentina once again into default, these so-called “other” holdouts said in a court filing late Thursday that the $539 million deposit that Argentina made to its indentured trustee, BNY Mellon, should go toward satisfying their U.S. court-awarded claims. The deposit made on June 26, 2014 was deemed illegal by U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa. In 2012 Griesa ruled Argentina could not make coupon payments on its restructured debt without also paying concurrently a group of holdout investors, separate from the Italians, an award of $1.33 billion plus interest. Griesa ordered BNY Mellon to leave the money untouched until further instruction. This group of holdouts, mainly made up of Italian pensioners, argue that the court has jurisdiction over BNY Mellon and therefore can go after that money, otherwise defined as an attachment, that has been sitting in its account held at the Central Bank of Argentina in Buenos Aires. “That the Republic’s funds are held in BNY Mellon’s bank account located outside of New York is of no moment,” the Italians argued. “Based on the forgoing, an order should be issued directing BNY Mellon to turnover to Plaintiffs the $539 million, or so much of it as is sufficient to satisfy their judgments, plus post-judgement interest,” the Italians’ lawyers wrote. There are approximately 40 plaintiffs included in the Italian group. Their judgments for $150 million on their principal investment were awarded in 2007. After Argentina’s 2002 default, the interest rate accruing on the Italian-held bonds under that judgment is 9 percent, the limit allowed under New York law, said the lead lawyer for the Italians, Anthony Costantini, from the firm of Duane Morris in New York. Argentina and the holdouts, led by NML Capital Ltd, an affiliate of Elliott Management Corp and Aurelius Capital Management, failed to settle their dispute by July 30, causing the default on around $29 billion in debt restructured in 2005 and 2010. This latest lawsuit, based upon an attachment argument against BNY Mellon, differs from at least three lawsuits filed in the last two weeks by investors who are riding the coattails of the Elliott/Aurelius judgment, which was based upon the principle of pari passu, or equal treatment. These are referred to as “me too” lawsuits. In the case of the Italians, by design or accident, they are  following the argument made by Buenos Aires in a legal notice published in U.S. newspapers on Thursday that exchange bondholders should sue BNY Mellon for their coupon payments. Argentina argues it is not in default because it paid the money on bonds restructured in 2005 and 2010, seemingly leaving its trustee bank BNY Mellon to deal with any legal fallout. Griesa ordered Argentina and the Elliott/Aurelius camp to appear in court on Friday at 3 p.m. (1900 GMT) to hold a hearing “regarding recent statements” made by the Republic.

311,BK,BNY Mellon sucked into center of Argentine debt storm,"BUENOS AIRES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon found itself front and center of Argentina’s debt battle on Tuesday after the South American country stripped its authorization to operate there and bondholders seeking payment filed a lawsuit against the U.S. bank. BNY Mellon, a financial intermediary between the Argentine government and its bond investors, in June held onto a $539 million interest payment owed to bondholders on the orders of a U.S. court. The U.S. District Court in New York had ruled that Argentina could not pay creditors who accepted discounted restructured bonds under U.S. legislation unless it also paid the holdout U.S. investment funds that rejected bond swaps in 2005 and 2010. The frozen coupon payment tipped Latin America’s No.3 economy into its second default in little over a decade. The Argentine government argued it had met its debt obligations and urged holders of exchange debt to pursue BNY Mellon for payment. A lawsuit filed in London by four hedge funds said that BNY Mellon’s actions “have been consistently designed to protect its own interests.” If the lawsuit  - filed at London’s High Court by hedge funds Knighthead Master Fund, RGY Investments LLC, George Soros’s Quantum Partners and Hayman Capital Master Fund - is successful it may put pressure on U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa, who has presided over Argentina’s drawn-out debt battle with the holdouts, to exempt bonds that fall under jurisdictions outside the United States. The plaintiffs, who hold Argentine debt amounting to 1.3 billion euros, argue their euro-denominated bonds fall under English legislation and therefore should not be swept up in Griesa’s rulings. Griesa has ruled the bonds should because interest payments made on them pass through New York and therefore fall under his jurisdiction. On Tuesday, BNY Mellon said the lawsuit filed against it was “without merit.” “We continue to follow the current court order to hold onto the money,” a spokesman for BNY Mellon told Reuters. Argentina’s Congress is due on Wednesday to discuss a law that would replace BNY Mellon as intermediary for payments on foreign law bonds with state-controlled bank Banco Nacion, as part of a new debt restructuring plan. The central bank “has revoked BNY’s authorization for representation in Argentina,” Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich said in his daily briefing. The authorization applied specifically to two BNY Mellon officials. If Argentina’s draft legislation is enacted and executed, it would allow it to skirt Griesa’s court orders and resume interest payments on an estimated $29 billion in restructured bonds. The debt crisis has taken a toll on Argentine assets and the peso, which sank to a record low of 14.20 per dollar on the black market on Tuesday despite the central bank’s lifting interest rates in an apparent bid to ease pressure on the currency. A central bank source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that revoking BNY Mellon’s authorization would not prevent it from transferring the frozen $539 million to bondholders if it decided to fulfill the payment.

Argentina’s Congress is due on Wednesday to discuss a law that would replace BONY as intermediary for payments on foreign law bonds with the state-controlled bank Banco Nacion, as part of a new debt restructuring plan. BONY in June obeyed a U.S. court ruling to block a $539 million interest payment on debt that was restructured following Argentina’s record 2002 debt default, paving the way for the country’s second default in 12 years in July. The court had ruled Argentina could not pay holders of restructured bonds unless it also paid so-called “holdout” U.S. investment funds, which refused its 2005 and 2010 bond swaps in the wake of the 2002 default on about $100 billion of debt. The central bank “has revoked BNY’s authorization for representation in Argentina,” Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich said in his daily briefing.

Helaba said the agreement would initially cover southeast Asia, India and China and that other German savings banks beyond the 25 largest would be able to join in future. The joint-venture marks an attempt by Helaba to broaden its services to German companies after coming smoothly through the financial crisis.

Helaba said on Wednesday it planned to open a representative office in Singapore this year to support German small and medium-sized companies, known as the “Mittelstand,” which are the backbone of the country’s manufacturing strength. BNY Mellon would act as an international sales partner for all the joint-venture partners, promoting their brands in the Asia-Pacific region. Helaba and the savings banks would route letters of credit, used for trade finance, from German importers via BNY Mellon’s branch network. “This deal helps connect the famed Mittelstand with the fastest growing region in the world,” Ian Stewart, the chief executive of BNY Mellon’s treasury services said in a statement. BNY Mellon has a longstanding relationship with Germany’s savings banks, having acted as one of their partner banks for almost 50 years.

322,BK,BNY Mellon says charging clients on their euro deposits,"BOSTON (Reuters) - BNY Mellon Corp, the world’s largest custody bank, said on Friday it began earlier this month charging clients 0.20 percent on euro-denominated deposits that recently totaled about $33 billion. BNY Mellon initiated the charge on Oct. 1, reflecting a recent move by the European Central Bank to charge 20 basis points on deposits in hopes of persuading banks to lend more money to businesses and consumers. “Many institutions started to charge for deposits,” BNY Mellon Chief Financial Officer Todd Gibbons said. “We’re kind of in the middle of the pack.” Since imposing the 0.20 percent charge, there has been some decline in euro-denominated deposits at the bank, he said. Matt Eagan, a portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles, said his bond funds have been repatriating cash back to the United States to avoid getting charged on bond interest payments that might otherwise be parked at a European bank.  “Our clients don’t want to get charged for deposits in Europe,” Eagan said. BNY Mellon reported $221.7 billion in average deposits at the end of September. And the bank said 15 percent of that amount was in euro-denominated deposit liabilities. Banks typically pay customers for their deposits, but that amount has been paltry amid an environment of prolonged, rock-bottom interest rates. The ECB’s charge on deposits is designed to spur economic activity. In June, the ECB took the extraordinary step of charging banks 0.10 percent to park their money at the central bank. And in September, that negative rate was increased to 0.20 percent in a move to jump start a flagging European economy. As of Sept. 30, BNY Mellon had $92.3 billion in interest-bearing deposits with the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks. That is down from $106 billion at the end of June.  Gibbons declined to say how much of the bank’s deposits were with the ECB. In 2011, BNY Mellon told some of its biggest depositors, hedge funds and other asset managers, that it would charge them a nominal fee of 0.13 percentage points a year on deposits in excess of $50 million. The move came amid the Greek debt crisis and the U.S. debt ceiling debate. The financial turmoil spurred big bank clients to sell riskier assets and to shift the proceeds into the shelter of their bank accounts. And in 2012, the bank openly talked about charging clients on their euro deposits as jittery investors felt more comfortable parking their cash rather than buying stocks and bonds. But no decision was made at the time.  In the recently ended third quarter, BNY Mellon’s net interest margin - largely the difference between what the bank pays on deposits and what it earns on the money through investing - was 0.94 percent compared with 1.16 percent in the year-earlier quarter.

323,BK,U.S. court tosses Argentina appeal over funds held by BNY Mellon,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday dismissed Argentina’s appeal of an order directing Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) to hold onto $539 million the country deposited for its restructured bondholders. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York in a brief order said it lacked jurisdiction over the appeal as the August ruling by U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa was a clarification rather than modification of his earlier rulings on the matter. Griesa had ruled that the $539 million that Argentina deposited in June with BNY Mellon for bondholders who participated in two sovereign debt restructurings was “illegal,” and in an August order, directed the bank to retain the funds. The judge, in his August ruling, also said BNY Mellon’s retention of the funds would not violate his prior orders or subject it to liability. A spokesman for BNY Mellon did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did a U.S. lawyer for Argentina. Argentina defaulted in July after refusing to honor court orders to pay $1.33 billion plus interest to U.S. hedge funds suing for full payment on bonds following its earlier 2002 default.  The hedge funds, led by NML and Aurelius Capital Management, had spurned the country’s 2005 and 2010 debt restructurings, which resulted in exchanges for about 92 percent of the country’s defaulted debt.  Investors who exchanged bonds were paid less than 30 cents on the dollar. The country’s most recent default came after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Argentina’s appeal of a ruling that it must pay the holdouts when it paid holders of the exchanged bonds. Griesa subsequently blocked BNY Mellon from processing a $539 million interest payment on what the country says is over $28 billion in debt.  The order sent Argentina on a course to default after no settlement was reached. A later order, the one Argentina appealed, set out BNY Mellon’s responsibilities to hold onto the money. BNY Mellon, which filed a brief in the case, said Griesa’s order helped protect it from liability, as “nearly every economic stakeholder in this litigation has either sued or threatened to sue” the bank, including Argentina.

327,BK,Ex-Bank of New York Mellon employee pleads guilty to insider trading,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) employee on Friday pleaded guilty to insider trading based on tips from a former Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) employee about potential pharmaceutical mergers. Federal prosecutors in New York said David Post, 41, a product manager at the bank, received nonpublic information from a former Rutgers Business School classmate about three companies: Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Ardea BioSciences and ViroPharma Inc [VIRO.UL]. Prosecutors did not name the classmate, but on Oct. 14 they charged Zachary Zwerko, a former senior finance analyst with Merck, with passing inside tips about the same three stocks to a Rutgers classmate who worked at a bank. The connection was confirmed when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday amended a parallel civil complaint against Zwerko to include Post as a defendant. Ron Gruendl, a spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon, said Post’s conduct was not connected to his work at the bank. “We have cooperated fully with law enforcement and regulatory agencies,” he said. “He is no longer employed here.” According to criminal and civil court filings, Zwerko passed information to Post about Merck’s acquisition of Idenix as well as Ardea and ViroPharma, which Zwerko learned were potential acquisition targets. Post then traded on the information and split the profits with Zwerko, authorities said. AstraZeneca PLC (AZN.L) announced a bid for Ardea in April 2012, while Shire PLC (SHP.L) announced a takeover of ViroPharma in November 2013. “Post and Zwerko tried to keep law enforcement authorities in the dark by using prepaid cell phones and a dummy e-mail account to communicate inside information, and Post doled out the kickbacks inside his own home,” Sanjay Wadhwa, senior associate director of the SEC’s New York regional office, said in a statement. At a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, a tearful Post admitted he executed a series of trades between 2012 and 2014 based on the tips. He entered a guilty plea to one count of conspiracy and three counts of securities fraud as part of a cooperation agreement with the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jessica Masella said in court that Post is believed to have earned more than $700,000 in illicit profits.

The custody bank took a litigation and restructuring charge of $10 million when it reported its quarterly results last month.

364,BK,BNY Mellon to pay $714 million to settle foreign exchange cases,"(Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp has agreed to pay $714 million to settle allegations that the bank overcharged pension funds and other clients for foreign exchange services, U.S. federal and state authorities said on Thursday.  Federal and New York state authorities, among others, had accused BNY Mellon of telling clients it would provide the best possible execution for their currency transactions, but instead giving them prices at or near the worst interbank rates during the trading day. Meantime, authorities said, BNY Mellon obtained better spot prices for itself and profited on the spread. As part of the agreements settling lawsuits filed by New York and the United States, the bank accepted responsibility for the conduct, authorities said.  The world’s No. 1 custody bank also agreed to terminate David Nichols, its head of products management, and other executives, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. The other executives were not identified. “The bank repeatedly deceived its customers and is paying a heavy penalty for it,” Bharara said in a statement. BNY Mellon said that it resolved substantially all the foreign exchange-related actions pending as part of the $714 million, including by the U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and class action litigation. “We are pleased to put these legacy FX matters behind us,” the company said. BNY Mellon disclosed last month that it would take a $598 million charge as it tried to resolve the cases.  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s lawsuit, which began when a whistleblower filed a complaint in 2009, claimed that BNY Mellon earned $2 billion over ten years through the alleged deception. The U.S. complaint said the bank defrauded clients of hundreds of millions of dollars between 2000 and 2011.  In addition, the bank settled a class action suit partly led by two Ohio pension funds for $335 million pending court approval, said Ohio AG Mike Dewine, adding that the agreement had followed four years of “hard-fought” litigation. BNY Mellon will pay a penalty of $167.5 million to the United States. New York state will receive a further $167.5 million, nearly all of which will compensate victims of the misconduct, authorities said. The rest of the funds will be split between other agencies involved. The settlement also resolves Justice Department claims against Nichols, 60, BNY Mellon’s products management head. As part of the agreement, Nichols admitted to knowing the bank did not disclose its pricing methodology to customers, who did not fully understand it, among other things. Attorney Stephen Fishbein, who represents Nichols, declined to comment. The cases include United States v. Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-06969, and People of the State of New York v.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Wednesday the fine was levied on Bank of New York Mellon’s London branch, and on Bank of New York Mellon International Limited for breaches that spanned nearly six years from November 2007 to August 2013.                Bank of New York Mellon is the world’s biggest custody bank, whose business is looking after financial assets such as stocks and bonds for customers.     The collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 prompted UK regulators to check that custody banks like BNY were complying with safe keeping rules as markets went into meltdown globally. “The firms’ failure to comply with our rules including their failure to adequately record, reconcile and protect safe custody assets was particularly serious given the systemically important nature of the firms and the fact that safeguarding assets is core to their business,” Georgina Philippou, acting director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA said. BNY, which had $28.5 trillion of assets under custody globally at the end of 2014, said the fine was fully covered by pre-existing legal reserves and no clients suffered any loss as a result of the issues identified by the FCA. A bank said it had undertaken a broad internal review with the assistance of outside accountants and legal advisers which has led to new and improved policies and operational procedures. “We regret in this case that we did not meet our standards or those of the FCA,” the bank said.

BNY Mellon Chief Executive Gerald Hassell has been under pressure from hedge fund activists unhappy with expense controls and profit growth at the world’s largest custody bank. But in the first quarter, non-interest expense at the bank fell 1 percent to $2.7 billion from year-ago levels.  The custody bank’s earnings were $766 million, or 67 cents a share, compared with $661 million, or 57 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts, on average, were expecting 59 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue was $3.9 billion, or 6 percent higher than the year-ago quarter.

377,BK,Fitch Upgrades The Bank of New York Mellon and Related U.S. Depositories L-T IDRs to 'AA',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded the Long-Term IDR of The  Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) and related U.S. insured depository institutions  (IDIs) to 'AA' from 'AA-'. The Rating Outlooks on the Long-Term IDRs are Stable.  Fitch has also downgraded the support ratings of The Bank of New York Mellon  Corporation (BK) and BNYM in line with our view of sovereign support. BK's and  BNYM's viability ratings are unaffected in today's rating action. A full list of  rating actions follows at the end of this rating action commentary.  The upgrade of BNYM's (and related U.S. IDIs) ratings reflects the expected  implementation of total loss absorbing capital (TLAC) requirements for U.S.  Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) and the presence of a substantial  debt buffer in the holding company. Fitch also believes that, in line with our Support Rating (SR) definition of  '5', extraordinary external support, while possible, can no longer be relied  upon for BK and its subsidiaries. We have, therefore, downgraded their Support  Ratings (SR) to '5' from '1' and revised their Support Rating Floors (SRF) to  'No Floor' from 'A'. The rating actions are in conjunction with Fitch's review of sovereign support  for banks globally, which the agency announced in March 2014. In line with its  expectations announced in March last year and communicated regularly since then,  Fitch believes legislative, regulatory and policy initiatives have substantially  reduced the likelihood of sovereign support for U.S., Swiss and European Union  commercial banks. At the same time, Fitch has taken into account progress with  the U.S. single point of entry (SPE) resolution regime and TLAC implementation  for U.S. G-SIBs. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs AND SENIOR DEBT The VRs remain equalized between BK and its material operating subsidiaries,  namely BNYM. The common VR of BK and its operating companies reflects the  correlated performance, or failure rate between the BK and these subsidiaries.  Fitch takes a group view on the credit profile from a failure perspective, while  the IDR reflects each entity's non-performance (default) risk on senior debt.  Fitch believes that the likelihood of failure is roughly equivalent, while the  default risk given at the operating company would be lower given TLAC. All U.S.  bank subsidiaries carry a common VR, regardless of size, as U.S. banks are  cross-guaranteed under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and  Enforcement Act (FIRREA).  The Long-Term IDRs for the material U.S. operating entities are one notch above  BK's to reflect Fitch's belief that the U.S. single point of entry (SPE)  resolution regime, the likely implementation of total loss absorbing capital  (TLAC) requirements for U.S. G-SIBs, and the presence of substantial holding  company debt reduces the default risk of domestic operating subsidiaries' senior  liabilities relative to holding company senior debt. In our view these buffers  would provide substantial protection to senior unsecured obligations in the  domestic operating entities in the event of group resolution, as they could be  used to absorb losses and recapitalize operating companies. Therefore,  substantial holding company debt reduces the likelihood of default on operating  company senior obligations. As at end-2014, BK had hybrid and senior debt as a  percent of risk-weighted assets (RWA) of approximately 11%, sufficiently close  enough to meeting its Pillar 1 capital requirement.  The 'F1+' Short-Term IDRs of BK's bank subsidiaries reflects the substantial  liquidity at the banks and typically higher core deposit funding, further  liquidity resources at BK that could be extended to the bank and access to  further contingent liquidity sources such as Federal Home Loan Bank advances.  RATING SENSITIVITIES -IDRs AND SENIOR DEBT IDRs and senior debt are sensitive to any changes in the VR.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  The SR and SRF reflect Fitch's view that senior creditors can no longer rely on  receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that BK  becomes non-viable. In Fitch's view, implementation of the Dodd Frank Orderly  Liquidation Authority legislation is now sufficiently progressed to provide a  framework for resolving banks that is likely to require holding company senior  creditors participating in losses, if necessary, instead of or ahead of the  company receiving sovereign support. Any upward revision to the SR and SRF would be contingent on a positive change  in the U.S.'s propensity to support its banks. While not impossible, this is  highly unlikely in Fitch's view.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - DEPOSIT RATINGS The upgrade of BK's deposit ratings is based on the upgrade of their IDRs.  Deposit ratings are one notch higher than senior debt reflecting the deposits'  superior recovery prospects in case of default given depositor preference in the  U.S.  Fitch has upgraded the following ratings:  The Bank of New York Mellon BNY Mellon National Association BNY Mellon Trust Delaware The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association --Long-Term IRD to 'AA' from 'AA-'; Outlook Stable; --Long-Term Deposits to 'AA+' from 'AA'; The Bank of New York Mellon --Long-Term senior debt to 'AA' from 'AA-'.

The Financial Reporting Council said on Tuesday the investigation would cover the conduct of KPMG auditors regarding BNY Mellon’s London branch. “We are committed to setting the highest standards in our work and will cooperate fully with the FRC in its enquiries,” a KPMG spokesman said. Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority fined BNY Mellon, the world’s biggest custody bank, 126 million pounds ($199 million) in April for failing to keep customer money safe during the financial crisis. BNY’s rule breaches spanned nearly six years from November 2007 to August 2013. This period included the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, which prompted British regulators to check that custody banks were complying with safe-keeping rules. KPMG, one of the world’s “Big Four” accounting firms, was responsible for reporting to the financial regulator that BNY Mellon was complying with rules on the safe-keeping of customer assets. The FRC’s investigation will cover the years’ that ended on 31 December 2007 to 31 December 2011. The watchdog has powers to impose unlimited fines and ban an accountant from the industry.

388,BK,UPDATE 1-Chesapeake Energy ordered to pay $379.7 mln in bond dispute,"(Adds Bank of New York Mellon statement, Chesapeake closing stock price) By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK, July 10 (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Friday ordered Chesapeake Energy Corp to pay $379.7 million to bond investors, after the natural gas company waited too long to tell them of its plan to redeem their $1.3 billion of bonds six years early. U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan agreed with bond trustee Bank of New York Mellon Corp that holders of Chesapeake’s 6.775 notes maturing in 2019 were entitled to a special “make-whole” price because of the early redemption. The payout is more than triple the roughly $100 million that Chesapeake hoped to distribute in “restitutionary” damages. It originally argued that its March 15, 2013 redemption notice entitled it to redeem the notes at face value, but a federal appeals court in November said that notice came one month late. Bank of New York Mellon acted on behalf of a variety of hedge funds and other bondholders such as Ares Management LLC, Aurelius Capital Management LP, P. Schoenfeld Asset Management LP and Taconic Capital Advisors LP. “We are pleased with the court’s decision vindicating the noteholders’ interests,” bank spokesman Kevin Heine said. Chesapeake spokesman Gordon Pennoyer declined to comment. Shares of Chesapeake closed down 31 cents, or 2.7 percent, at $11.37 in Friday trading. The redemption was intended to help Chesapeake reduce a debt burden that the Oklahoma City-based company had accumulated under former Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon, and offset natural gas prices that had fallen to a decade low. But Engelmayer, whose original ruling in Chesapeake’s favor was reversed by the appeals court, said investors were entitled to hold Chesapeake to its obligations under the bond indenture, rather than accept lesser sums. “Investors who decided to buy (or hold) the 2019 notes were beneficiaries of a contract,” he wrote. “The interest in respecting investors’ legitimate expectations therefore supports a payout keyed to the indenture’s treatment of redemptions after March 15, 2013.” The notes were redeemed in May 2013 as part of a refinancing, and Chesapeake recorded a $33 million loss at the time. The case is Chesapeake Energy Corp v. Bank of New York Mellon Trust Co, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-01582.

389,BK,BNY Mellon to pay $14.8 mln to settle intern bribery probe,"(Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp will pay $14.8 million to settle U.S. civil charges it gave internships to family members of officials linked to a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund, violating federal bribery laws. The settlement by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission marked the first time regulators had charged a bank for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits paying bribes to foreign officials. It followed a 2011 industrywide sweep, undertaken as part of a broader foreign bribery probe, in which the SEC sought information about financial institutions’ business dealings with state-owned investment funds. The BNY Mellon case is also the first foreign bribery enforcement action in which internships, as opposed to cash, constituted the alleged bribe, SEC enforcement director Andrew Ceresney said. Other banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Deutsche Bank AG have also been investigated over whether their hiring practices violated the foreign bribery statute. “BNY Mellon deserved significant sanction for providing valuable student internships to family members of foreign officials to influence their actions,” Andrew Ceresney, the SEC’s director of enforcement, said in a statement. According to the SEC, BNY Mellon beginning in 2010 hired as interns the son and nephew of an official with the Middle East fund, and the son of another official in its European office. The SEC said the bank did not choose the interns through its usual, highly competitive hiring process. Instead, BNY Mellon sought to corruptly win or keep asset management and service business from the fund, a client since 2000 with about $55 billion at the bank, the SEC said. One BNY Mellon employee called hiring the interns an “expensive ‘favor’” in an email. Another said “silly things like this help influence who ends up with more assets/retaining dominant position.” The interns came across as less-than-exemplary workers, the SEC said, with bank employees complaining that two were absent  repeatedly and a third “wasn’t actually as hardworking” as hoped. BNY Mellon neither admitted nor denied the charges and said it has “taken steps to enhance our existing internal controls and procedures with respect to our internship and hiring practices.” The sovereign wealth fund was not named in an SEC administrative order.

In a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, which sued in its capacity as receiver for the former Guaranty Bank, said it suffered more than $440 million in losses when it sold the securities in March 2010. The FDIC filed a similar lawsuit against US Bancorp (USB.N), another major bond trustee, over more than $248 million of mortgage debt bought by Guaranty, and resulting in “significant” losses when those securities were sold. Austin, Texas-based Guaranty Bank closed in August 2009, and the FDIC arranged for its deposits to be assumed by BBVA Compass of Birmingham, Alabama, a unit of Spain’s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA.MC). At the time, the regulator estimated the closure would cost its deposit insurance fund $3 billion. The Bank of New York Mellon lawsuit concerned 12 mortgage-backed trusts issued by Bear Stearns Cos’ EMC Mortgage Corp unit and by Countrywide Home Loans Inc in 2005 and 2006. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) bought Bear in 2008, and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) bought Countrywide in the same year. As bond trustee, BNY Mellon “shirked its duty” to ensure the loan documents were not incomplete or defective, the FDIC said. “While BNY Mellon stood idly for years, the sponsors kept defective mortgage loans in the covered trusts, servicers reaped excessive fees for servicing the defaulted loans from the covered trusts, and plaintiff was left to suffer enormous losses,” the lawsuit said. A spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon had no immediate comment. US Bancorp spokesman Dana Ripley declined to comment. Since 2013, the FDIC has secured $1.83 billion in settlements with financial institutions over mortgage-backed securities sold to banks it took into receivership. In July, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) agreed to pay the FDIC $24 million to resolve a lawsuit filed in a Texas state court, according to a settlement agreement on the regulator’s website. The cases are Federal Deposit Insurance Corp v. The Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 15-06560; and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp v U.S. Bank NA in the same court, No. 15-06570.

400,BK,U.S. court rejects creditors' bid for Argentine funds held by BNY Mellon,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Monday refused to force Bank of New York Mellon Corp to turn over to holders of defaulted Argentine bonds any of the $539 million the country deposited in 2014 to pay creditors who participated in its past restructurings. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York upheld an October 2014 ruling from U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa, agreeing that the plaintiffs were not entitled to possess the funds and did not have rights to the money superior to that of BNY Mellon. “At most, then, the (Argentine) Republic’s transfer was a preference among creditors,” a three-judge panel wrote. “But under New York law, preferring one creditor over another is neither actually nor constructively fraudulent.” Anthony Costantini, a lawyer for the majority of the bondholders seeking payment, said the court failed to take into account additional legal arguments he made in a letter filed last week. “We will make a motion for rehearing,” he said. A lawyer for Argentina, Carmine Boccuzzi, said in an email, “The Court of Appeals correctly recognized that these are exchange bondholder funds to which holdouts have no claim.” A lawyer and a spokesman for BNY Mellon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Griesa has previously blocked Argentina from making payments to bondholders who participated in sovereign debt exchanges in 2005 and 2010 following the country’s $100 billion default in 2002, unless it also pays holdout creditors who refused to do so. The plaintiffs in the two cases decided Monday did not include Elliott Management’s NML Capital Ltd and Aurelius Capital Management, who lead the holdout group that Griesa has ruled is entitled to $1.33 billion plus interest from Argentina. In June 2014, the republic deposited $539 million in BNY Mellon’s account at the Central Bank of Argentina, earmarked for exchange bondholders. But Griesa ordered BNY, the trustee for the funds, to hold the money, saying Argentina’s actions violated his prior orders. The bondholders affected by Monday’s decisions have approximately $100 million in judgments against Argentina. The South American country again defaulted in July 2014 after refusing to honor Griesa’s orders. The cases are Applestein et al v. The Republic of Argentina, No. 14-4221, and Dussault v. Republic of Argentina, No. 14-4235, both in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

The large custody bank roiled much of the U.S. mutual fund industry in August when one of the accounting systems it uses to generate prices for funds collapsed. The problems lasted more than a week and affected about $400 billion in assets. ((reut.rs/1kkLxgG)) Speaking on a conference call with analysts to discuss the earnings, BNY Mellon Chief Financial Officer Thomas Gibbons said expenses in the period were higher because of concessions the company gave to clients as a result of the glitch. The bank did not break out an exact figure but said payment waivers or refunds to clients were accounted for in its “other” non-interest expense line of $268 million during the quarter, which was 7 percent higher than in the previous quarter and year-ago quarter. The “other” category also was the only type of non-interest expense to increase compared with a year ago, BNY Mellon said. Because of the outage, clients “went through a challenging week, so we wanted to make sure we were proactive in covering their costs and taking care of them,” BNY Mellon Chief Executive Gerald Hassell said on the conference call. Hassell said the bank is “actively working with the clients, working with their fund boards, making sure that they fully understand what happened and how we recovered and why the system is stable and safe.” Hassell added that the bank is considering whether to start charging clients for U.S. dollar-denominated deposits, in the face of low interest rates. It began charging to hold euro-denominated deposits a year ago.

411,BK,Bank of NY Mellon must face lawsuit over $1.12 bln mortgage loss,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp  must face a lawsuit seeking to hold it liable for causing $1.12 billion of investor losses by failing to properly monitor five trusts backed by toxic residential mortgages, a Manhattan federal judge ruled. U.S. District Judge Gregory Woods said Belgium’s Royal Park Investments SA/NV may pursue claims that the bank, as trustee for trusts dating from 2005 to 2007, ignored widespread, systemic abuse in how the underlying loans were underwritten and serviced, and failed to require that bad loans be repurchased. “Indeed,” Woods wrote in his decision on Wednesday, “it would be implausible to assume that somehow all of the mortgage loans underlying the trusts miraculously avoided the pervasive practices of the industry at the time.” The judge let Royal Park pursue claims including breach of contract, breach of trust, and violations of the federal Trust Indenture Act. Some other claims were dismissed. Royal Park contended that Bank of New York breached its duties in part out of fear it might anger or lose business from other financial services companies in retaliation. Other Manhattan federal judges have in the last year let Royal Park pursue similar claims against Deutsche Bank AG  and HSBC Holdings Plc. A spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon declined immediate comment. Royal Park has sought class-action status on behalf of other investors. It said its own residential mortgage-backed securities in the five trusts overseen by Bank of New York Mellon have become “completely worthless.” Bond issuers appoint trustees to ensure that payments are funneled to investors, and handle back-office work after securities are sold. The case is Royal Park Investments SA/NV v.

415,BK,BNY Mellon to pay $3 million after Massachusetts probe of funds glitch,"(Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) has agreed to pay $3 million in settling a state investigation into problems it faced in calculating net asset values on some 1,200 mutual funds last August, Massachusetts’ top securities regulator said on Monday. Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin said the New York trust bank had subcontracted the calculations to a third party and lacked a backup plan when the sub-contractor was unable to calculate net asset values for the funds. The lack of the plan “represents a departure from high standards of commercial honor,” the settlement agreement states, according to Galvin’s office. The glitch unsettled broad parts of the fund industry last summer and highlighted how reliant BNY Mellon remained on a patchwork of technology platforms. The outage left BNY Mellon unable to calculate net asset values on the funds for about 66 clients by the close of trading on Aug. 24, according to a statement by Galvin’s office, which added that BNY Mellon has since improved its internal controls and supervisory procedures. BNY spokesman Kevin Heine said the bank is unaware of any investor losses tied to the problems and that it calculated net asset values with other means that day. Where funds requested it, shareholder transactions were reprocessed with system-generated net asset values and the bank waived any reprocessing fees, he said. “While we truly regret any confusion our clients may have experienced during the initial hours of the outage, the fact remains that BNY Mellon took decisive action during an unprecedented vendor failure to protect our clients’ interests and deliver daily net asset values to the funds in accordance with their instructions,” Heine said.

422,BK,Fitch: BNY Mellon Continues to Cut Costs in 1Q16,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 22 (Fitch) The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK)  controlled its cost base in the first quarter of 2016 (1Q16) and reported net  income of $804 million on revenue of $3.7 billion. Revenues were flat from the  linked quarter and down modestly compared to the year-ago period. BK continues  to focus on holding down its expenses, which remains the key driver for  producing positive operating leverage, according to Fitch Ratings. BK's 1Q16 net income equated to a 0.93% annualized return on average assets  (ROAA) up from both 0.86% in the sequential quarter and 0.88% a year ago. The  company's adjusted 1Q16 annualized return on average common equity (ROACE) was  9.7%, up from the 8.9% it generated in 4Q15 and 9.2% in 1Q15. BK's returns this  quarter were stronger than the other U.S. Globally Systemic Important Banks  (G-SIBs), reporting to date, which averaged ROACE of 7.3%. These banks were  affected by volatile trading conditions and higher credit costs related to  energy loans, which had less of an impact on BK given its business model. Total fee revenues were up 1% on a linked-quarter and down 1% on a  year-over-year basis. Linked-quarter results mainly reflect improvements in  depositary receipts due to higher dividend fees and lower money market fee  waivers in investment management, clearing services and corporate trust, offset  somewhat by seasonally weaker performance fees and lower investment management  fees. Year-over-year results were affected by weaker foreign exchange trading  and lower asset management fees due to net outflows, offset somewhat by  lease-related gains and lower money market waivers. Management indicated that  roughly half of money market fee waivers have been recovered following the Fed's  December rate increase. Fitch regards overall performance to be stable. Net interest revenue (NIR) was up 1% on a sequential basis and was up 5%  year-over-year due to 2- and 4- basis point (bp) improvements in the net  interest margin (NIM), respectively, to 101bps. NIM expansion was mainly driven  by the Fed's December rate hike, which lifted yields on cash investments and  floating rate loans, offset by slightly higher deposit costs and interest rate  hedges. Management noted deposit betas experienced were somewhat lower than  anticipated, which led to lower deposit cost increases relative to the Fed rate  increase. Fitch continues to believe BK's NIR is quite sensitive to further  movements in short-term interest rates. Expenses were down 2% sequentially and 3% year-over-year, as BK remained focused  on driving incremental improvements across the company, leading to reductions in  nearly all reported expense categories. BK continues to approach expense  management as an ongoing process. During the quarter, it moved staff to  lower-cost locations, brought more technology development in-house, and lowered  its real estate footprint relative to previous quarters. Fitch believes that in  a stronger rate and economic environment, much of the work BK has done on the  expense front will become more evident through further increases in operating  leverage.  Management indicated there could be some expense pressure for the remainder of  the year due to regulatory investments needed to address deficiencies identified  in BK's resolution plan. Regulators identified deficiencies related to BK's  plans for continuing to provide critical services throughout resolution under  Title I of Dodd-Frank (bankruptcy). Additionally, BK must also make progress on  deficiencies in its legal entity rationalization framework by the Oct. 1, 2016  resubmission deadline. Fitch does not view the lack of acceptance of BK's  resolution plan by regulators to be indicative of the company's current and  ongoing financial health. BK's ratings incorporate the expectation that it will  satisfy the regulators' requirements around its resolution planning.  BK's assets under management (AUM) through 1Q16 were $1.64 trillion, which is up  1% from 4Q15. The result was driven by modest net inflows in liability-driven  investments, offset by outflows of index and equity investments. Compared to  1Q15, AUM was down 5% due to unfavorable currency effects and net outflows from  equity, index, and cash funds. Assets under custody and administration (AUC/A)  were up 1% sequentially due to net new business and favorable currency effects.  AUC/A totaled $29.1 trillion at the end of 1Q16.  BK's fully phased-in Basel III CET1 of 9.8% (advanced approach) reported at the  end of 1Q16 improved by 30bps sequentially. The increase in CET1 was primarily  attributed to organic capital generation while risk-weighted assets under the  advanced approach increased slightly. Other transitional Basel III capital  ratios remain solid despite modestly decreasing due to additional phase-in of  the full rules. BK also continues to exceed the fully phased-in liquidity  coverage ratio (LCR) requirement. The company continues to make progress toward achieving compliance with the U.S.  supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), BK's binding constraint capital ratio,  having now reached the required ratio at the consolidated level. BK reported a  consolidated 5.1% SLR, which is up 20bps from the prior quarter. BK also  reported that its main bank subsidiary, The Bank of New York Mellon, had an  estimated 5.2% SLR, which improved 40bps during the quarter. Improvements were  driven by capital generation and a reduction in average deposits during the  quarter likely due in part to the Fed's rate movement, though period-end  balances spiked due to clients 'dressing up' their balance sheets for financial  reporting.  In Fitch's view, BK has thus far held off from implementing more broad measures  to push client deposits off its balance sheet, preferring to wait until closer  to the rule implementation date to possibly take more forceful actions. U.S.  rules will require BK to have at least 5% at the holding company and 6% at the  bank level. Fitch continues to believe that BK has adequate levers and time to  bring itself into compliance well ahead of required implementation, as  demonstrated this quarter by the achievement of compliance at the holding  company level.

429,BK,Bank of NY Mellon settles $312 mln claim tied to Sentinel fraud,"(Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp has agreed to end eight years of litigation in which it sought unsuccessfully to recoup $312 million it lent a Chicago-area money manager that collapsed in 2007, and whose former chief is now in prison for fraud. According to a Wednesday court filing, Bank of New York Mellon will be treated as an unsecured creditor with a $312 million claim in the bankruptcy of Sentinel Management Group Inc, formerly of Northbrook, Illinois. The settlement with Sentinel bankruptcy trustee Frederick Grede requires court approval. It followed the Jan. 8 rejection by the federal appeals court in Chicago of the bank’s effort to be treated as a secured creditor with a higher priority claim. Circuit Judge Richard Posner said an unsecured claim was appropriate because the bank had been aware of suspicious facts that should have led it to probe whether Sentinel and its chief Eric Bloom were involved in wrongdoing. It is unclear how much the bank will eventually recover on its claim, but it previously took a $170 million pre-tax write-off, or $106 million after taxes, as a result of Posner’s decision. Vincent Lazar, a Jenner & Block partner representing Grede, said the settlement will allow the trustee to make “substantial” additional payouts to Sentinel customers who were defrauded. A spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon declined to comment. Prosecutors said Bloom used the bank’s loan to help finance a “house” trading portfolio filled with risky and illiquid securities, and then concealed Sentinel’s looming insolvency. The firm went bankrupt in August 2007, and Bloom was charged with running what prosecutors called a $666 million fraud.

442,BK,BNY Mellon profit beats estimates as costs fall,"(Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit as expenses dropped 1.4 percent, and the world’s largest custody bank said on Thursday it expected costs to drop as much as 2 percent in 2016. The bank, whose shares rose as much as 4.7 percent in morning trading, has been under pressure from activist investors to cut costs to help make up for sluggish revenue growth in the face of low interest rates. Activist hedge fund Marcato Capital Management criticized the bank last year for having a “bloated” payroll. Marcato owned about 0.99 percent of BNY Mellon’s stock as of June 30. Train Fund Management LP, which had a 3.02 percent stake as of June 30, has praised the bank for its progress and said its leadership had demonstrated the will to improve performance. “We are getting a tailwind to the expense base from the strength of the dollar, and specifically the move in sterling because we do have a fairly large expense base in sterling,” Chief Financial Officer Todd Gibbons said on a post-earnings call with analysts.  The bank said its non-interest expenses fell to $2.64 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $2.68 billion a year earlier as the dollar’s strength helped to reduce software, equipment, legal, occupancy and business development costs. BNY Mellon said it expected costs to drop by 1-2 percent in 2016. It had earlier expected full-year expenses to be “flat to down” compared with 2015. The bank’s net profit jumped 18.8 percent to $974 million, or 90 cents per share, from $820 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 90 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 81 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

460,BK,Fitch: BNY Mellon Continues to Generate Good Operating Leverage,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 25 (Fitch) The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK)  reported net income of $822 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 (4Q16) on  revenue of $3.79 billion, according to Fitch Ratings. BK's 4Q16 net income  equated to a 0.96% annualized return on average assets (ROAA) down from 1.10%  sequential quarter but up from 0.69% a year ago.  Compared to the level a year ago, BK's performance benefited from increased  operating efficiency, higher net interest revenue and a smaller average balance  sheet. On linked quarter, the decline was mainly driven by seasonably lower  investment services fees partially offset by higher net interest revenue. Total fee revenues were down 6% on a linked-quarter and about flat on a  year-over-year basis. The decline from the prior quarter was mainly driven by  lower fees on issuer services, a function of typical fourth quarter seasonality  experienced in depository receipts. The decline also was a result of lower  investment management and performance fees, primarily reflecting asset outflows,  lower fixed income market values and money market fees that were partially  offset by higher performance fees.  Management indicated that the company has recovered about 70% of its fee waivers  with the 50 basis point increase. With an additional move from here, BK would  expect to capture nearly all of its fee waivers.  Relative to prior year, BK experienced growth in all investment services  business lines with fees were up 4% year-over-year. The growth was offset by  lower performance fees in investment management, which reflects unfavorable  impact of a stronger U.S. dollar (principally against the British pound), and  lower performance fees, partially offset by higher market values and money  market fees.  Net interest revenue (NIR) was up 7% on a sequential basis and was up 9%  year-over-year due to an 11bps improvement in the net interest margin (NIM) to  117bps. NIM expansion was positively impacted by a 5bps related to the interest  rate hedging activities and the premium amortization adjustment. Effective Oct.  1, 2016, BK changed its accounting method for the amortization of premiums and  accretion of discounts on certain mortgage back securities from the prepayment  method to the contractual method. This accounting change increased net interest  income for 4Q16 by approximately $15 million.  Fitch continues to believe BK's NIR is positively and highly sensitive to  further movements in short-term interest rates, offset by TLAC-related debt  issuances to build additional buffer to meet the new TLAC requirements. Expenses were flat sequentially and down 2% year-over-year, as BK remained  focused on driving incremental improvements across the company. Results this  quarter relative to a year ago reflect lower expenses in nearly all categories,  partially offset by abating fee waivers driving higher distribution and  servicing expense. Lower staff expense, professional legal and other services,  software and equipment, and business development reflect the benefit of the  business improvement process and the strength in the U.S. dollar. Fitch believes  that much of the work BK has done on the expense front will become more evident  through further increases in operating leverage as the economic environment  continues to improve.  BK's assets under management (AUM) through 4Q16 were $1.65 trillion, which is  down 4% from 3Q16 and up 1% from 4Q15. Net outflows in the quarter were mostly  from actively managed strategies while the increase from prior year reflects  higher market values offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar,  principally against the British pound. Assets under custody and administration  (AUC/A) were down 2% sequentially due chiefly to the unfavorable impact of a  stronger U.S. dollar. AUC/A totaled $29.9 trillion at the end of 4Q16.  BK's fully phased-in Basel III CET1 of 9.7% (advanced approach) reported at the  end of 4Q16 declined by 10bps sequentially. The decrease in CET1 was influenced  by increased share buybacks and accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI)  changes to capital resulting from higher interest rates. BK also continues to  exceed the fully phased-in liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement. The company reached the required U.S. supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), BK's  binding constraint capital ratio, at both the consolidated and the bank levels  in the quarter. On a fully phased-in basis, BK reported a consolidated 5.6% SLR,  which is down 10bps from the prior quarter. BK also reported that its main bank  subsidiary, The Bank of New York Mellon, had an estimated 6.1% SLR, which  improved 20bps during the quarter.

466,BK,Bank of NY Mellon must face $1 bln Commerzbank lawsuit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp must face a Commerzbank AG lawsuit seeking to hold it liable for toxic mortgage-backed securities that the German lender bought before the financial crisis, resulting in more than $1 billion of losses. U.S. District Judge George Daniels in Manhattan ruled on Tuesday that Commerzbank may pursue breach of contract and negligence claims, as well as a claim that Bank of New York Mellon violated the federal Trust Indenture Act. Bank of New York Mellon had no immediate comment. David Wollmuth, a lawyer for Commerzbank, declined to comment. Commerzbank had sued over Bank of New York Mellon’s role as trustee for 72 residential mortgage trusts and the Millstone II collateralized debt obligation, backed by home loans from lenders such as Countrywide Home Loans and NovaStar Mortgage. The lawsuit accused Bank of New York Mellon of having “sat idly” for years as losses piled up, rather than require lenders to buy back defective loans and press servicers to address  defaulted loans faster. Daniels said Commerzbank could pursue arguments that Bank of New York Mellon failed to act prudently, and may have had a conflict of interest because taking action against lenders and servicers could imperil “lucrative business relationships.” Three other claims were dismissed. Bond issuers appoint trustees to ensure that payments are funneled to investors, and handle back-office work after securities are sold. Many trustees have in recent years been sued by investors who claim they shirked their responsibilities. Commerzbank sued Bank of New York Mellon in December 2015, and filed similar lawsuits that month against Deutsche Bank AG , HSBC Holdings Plc and Wells Fargo & Co . Those lawsuits remain active. The cases in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, are Commerzbank AG v. The Bank of New York Mellon et al, No. 15-10029; Commerzbank AG v.

469,BK,Puerto Rico COFINA bondholder sues trustee Bank of New York,"NEW YORK, April 12 (Reuters) - A holder of sales tax-backed Puerto Rican debt, known as COFINA debt, sued Bank of New York Mellon Corp on Wednesday, alleging the bank breached its duty as trustee for COFINA debt to protect senior bondholders. Whitebox Advisers sued the bank in a New York state court, saying it should have either accelerated or frozen payouts on COFINA debt after technical defaults by the Puerto Rican government, which is facing an economic crisis marked by $70 billion in debt and a 45 percent poverty rate. Whitebox alleges that several events since 2015 constitute technical defaults, including plans by the government to restructure its debt and potentially cut recoveries to senior COFINA holders. The island’s current fiscal turnaround plan, approved by its federal financial oversight board in March, is one such event, Whitebox alleges, because it forecasts major cuts to all creditors, including COFINA. The complaint alleges the Bank of New York should have sought assurances that the government was committed to protecting COFINA debt and, in an event of default, should have frozen disbursements. Instead, it did not seek such assurances, and continued making disbursements to more junior COFINA holders, potentially risking payment cuts for more senior ones, the complaint alleges. Whitebox is seeking monetary damages from the bank of New York. A representative of the bank could not immediately be reached on Wednesday. The lawsuit is the latest indication of growing concern among creditors about potential cuts to recoveries. Senior COFINA holders already are facing efforts to slash their recoveries on two fronts - from the island’s oversight board, which is pushing cuts for all creditors, and from Puerto Rico’s general obligation (GO) bondholders, who have alleged in a separate lawsuit that sales tax revenue should be redirected to pay GO debt instead. Wednesday’s lawsuit essentially pits certain senior COFINA holders against junior ones, accusing the Bank of New York of failing to enforce priority rules for different classes of COFINA holders.

473,BK,BNY Mellon advances artificial intelligence tech across operations,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Bank of New York Mellon Corp has developed and deployed automated computer programs, or more than 220 “bots”, across its businesses over the past 15 months seeking more efficiency and lower costs, as the adoption of artificial intelligence technology in banking increases. The 233-year-old custodian bank says its new army of robotics, or software created to carry out an often repetitive task that would normally be performed by humans, range from automated programs that respond to data requests from external auditors, to systems that correct formatting and data mistakes in requests for dollar funds transfers.  BNY Mellon said 20 bots have been placed in production since the start of the year. The robotics push comes as the banking sector ramps up the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to save money and time on cumbersome and manual processes, ranging from back office tasks to customer service.  The bank estimates that its funds transfer bots alone are saving it $300,000 annually, by cutting down the time its employees need to spend on identifying and dealing with data mistakes and accelerating payments processing.  Bots are becoming particularly popular in banking for customer service, as banks are hopeful they can replace their costly large call centers. More than three quarters of 600 top bankers surveyed by consultancy Accenture Plc for a recent report said they believe AI will be the primary way banks interact with customers within the next three years. One of the objectives of BNY Mellon’s bot strategy is to help the organization “get rid of the mind numbing tasks” so that employees could focus on different activities, said Doug Shulman, senior executive vice president at BNY Mellon.   The bots also help provide a better client experience and reduce costs, Shulman added. The bank said, for example, bots that reply to information requests on financial statements from auditors, enabled it to cut down its response time to 24 hours from 6 to 10 business days. The process previously required humans to manually sift through large swathes of data stored across six different IT systems. Another bot in production allows the bank to process trades that fail to be automatically processed on its custody platform because of issues such as incorrect information. The bot investigates the reason for the failure and corrects the issue, cutting down processing times by 30 percent, the bank said.  But as AI advances, many banks face significant challenges with older systems as they have been around for decades and are not built for newer forms of computing.",5102017,http://www.reuters.com/article/bony-mellon-technology-ai/bny-mellon-advances-artificial-intelligence-tech-across-operations-idUSL1N1IC1W5

487,BK,UPDATE 4-BNY Mellon names former Visa CEO to top job,"(Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) said on Monday former Visa Chief Executive Charles Scharf will take the top job at the world’s largest custody bank, where he will focus on boosting organic growth. Scharf immediately replaces as CEO 65-year-old Gerald Hassell, who will remain chairman of BNY Mellon until the end of the year when he retires. Scharf will then become chairman. “The first priority is growing the company organically,” Scharf told Reuters. “We already are in places that have tremendous amounts of opportunity.” BNY Mellon had $30.6 trillion in assets under custody and administration at the end of March. The bank’s massive platform is a key part of the plumbing that keeps global financial markets flowing. Besides safeguarding the stocks and bonds of large institutions, the bank calculates mutual fund prices, trades foreign currencies and facilitates securities lending to enable short selling by hedge funds, for example.  Scharf, who headed Visa from October 2012 to December 2016, played a key role in orchestrating the world’s largest payments network’s reunion with its European affiliate. “It looks to me they got the right guy,” said Daniel O’Keefe, who runs the $2.9 billion Artisan Global Value Fund (ARTGX.O). That fund owned about 2.1 million BNY Mellon shares at the end of June, or 3.7 percent of its net assets. BNY Mellon shares closed up 1.9 percent at $53.35. The stock rose about 145 percent during the last five years of Hassell's tenure, which began in late August 2011. The S&P; 500 Index .SPX is up 81 percent over the past five years. In recent years, O’Keefe and other large BNY Mellon investors, including Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners, pushed for change at the bank. Hassell felt the brunt of the heat, getting support and a rebuke from Trian partner and chief investment officer Ed Garden at the bank’s 2015 annual meeting.  Still, O’Keefe said Scharf will run a company that is in a good position.  “Visa is a platform and a systems business, one of the best in the world,” O’Keefe said. “BNY is also effectively a systems and platform business. Its future lies in optimizing those systems and driving out costs.” Scharf and Hassell, during an interview with Reuters, agreed that the bank’s ability to wring out costs and keep up with the pace of change in technology will be a key part of its future. On a conference call BNY Mellon held on Monday afternoon with financial analysts, two asked about the timing of the executive change, which one called “a little abrupt.” Joseph Echevarria, the bank’s lead director, said the company has been engaged in the CEO succession process for “a couple of years” and looked at internal and external candidates.  Once the bank settled on Scharf, Hassell said, the goal was to show he was CEO from his first day on the job. “There’s nothing really sudden about it,” Hassell said.

500,BK,BNY Mellon and HSBC join Algomi to spur corporate bond liquidity,"LONDON, Oct 17 (IFR) - BNY Mellon and HSBC are partnering with bond trading technology provider Algomi to expand corporate bond trading opportunities for their custody clients and the wider market. The initiative aims to shore up ailing liquidity across the fixed income market by allowing custody clients to make select bond holdings available anonymously on the Algomi Honeycomb network. The network aggregates dealer data to help money managers find buyers and sellers of corporate bonds. The ability for dealers to tap databases of large global custodians on behalf of their buyside clients and find buyers or sellers for a specific bond in real-time, without compromising data privacy, is a breakthrough development for fixed income markets, according to Stu Taylor, CEO of Algomi. “Working with two of the largest custodian banks will open up new avenues for price discovery and alert market participants to relevant signal data that indicates market activity, price and depth,” said Taylor. Data stemming from the multi-trillion dollar pool of custodian corporate credit holdings is perceived by some as the holy grail of inventory in corporate bond markets, where dealer holdings have plummeted to just 0.5% of the market in response to Basel III capital rules that hiked the cost of warehousing securities. Net holdings of corporate bonds by US primary dealers has fallen over the last decade to just US$20bn from US$286bn, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Over the same period, outstanding corporate debt has expanded by 75%. According to a recent study from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, the number of corporate bond trades stemming from orders and request-for-quotes has fallen to just 20%-25% in 2017 from 65% before the financial crisis. Counterparties on the network will be able to query anonymous bond holdings from custody clients that have opted in to the service. That will alert the custody holder and give them the ability to instruct their dealer to trade on their behalf, while protecting the client’s identity. “By enabling the market to access potential trade matches with our custodial clients, we can play a significant role in not only increasing our clients’ access to liquidity, but in improving the infrastructure of the entire market,” said Michelle Neal, CEO of BNY Mellon Markets. The partnership will have broad global coverage by combining HSBC’s presence across Asia, Europe and the Middle East and North Africa with BNY Mellon’s extensive US custody operations. “By collaborating with a cutting-edge fintech firm, in parallel with a leading US custodian business, we can use digital innovation to create a multi-trillion dollar bond pool that spans the globe,” said Niall Cameron, global head of corporate & institutional digital at HSBC. MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL Data privacy requirements have up to now prevented custodian information from being used to its full potential, and those involved in the latest initiative say that proven data security will be crucial in bringing clients onboard. “A permission-led approach that gives custody members the power to only reveal their data if they wish to interact with trade enquiries from the market provides a mutually beneficial model that enhances liquidity across the ecosystem,” said Mark Ledwards, head of the sellside division at Algomi. The initiative will go live for BNY Mellon and HSBC custody clients early next year, with the potential to expand to other custodians in the future. “Connecting buyside and sellside in this manner benefits both, and is sign of how fixed income markets continue to transform in the digital age,” said Mehmet Mazi, global head of credit trading at HSBC.

510,BK,Fed says will begin publishing new reference rates in second quarter 2018,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve will begin publishing new reference rates in the second quarter of next year, providing an alternative to the London interbank offered rate (Libor) used as a common benchmark for financial products. The three new rates had been released for public review previously, and are to be derived from data on overnight repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities. The broadest of the three is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), which the Fed said will include tri-party repo data collected by the Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) and General Collateral Finance Repo (GCF) data from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), plus bilateral Treasury repo transactions.  Another rate is the Tri-party General Collateral Rate (TGCR), which would be based only on tri-party repo data from the Bank of New York Mellon. The third rate, to be called the Broad General Collateral Rate (BGCR), would be based on tri-party repo data from Bank of New York Mellon and cleared GCF repo data from DTCC. Faith in Libor as a financial reference point has been declining since a rate-rigging scandal, and also due to the decline in the overnight bank loans from which it is derived.

514,BK,UPDATE 3-BNY Mellon freezes $22.6 bln in Kazakh oil fund assets,"ALMATY/LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N) has frozen $22.6 billion in assets held by Kazakhstan’s National Fund in a rare move that escalates a legal battle between the government and a Moldovan investor. Moldova’s Anatolie Stati and his companies earlier won damages against the Kazakh government and his pursuit of payment has lead to some 40 percent of the oil revenue-supported fund being frozen.  Details of the asset freeze, which took place in October, were reported by Reuters on Thursday and were subsequently disclosed at a court hearing in Britain. “It’s pretty unprecedented,” said Simon Quijano-Evans, an investment strategist at Legal & General Investment Management in London. “If 40 percent of a sovereign fund is frozen and you don’t have access to it, that should be an alarm bell for policymakers.” Kazakhstan's dollar bonds fell after the news while its tenge KZT= currency strengthened by 0.6 percent. “Theoretically (the fund) is a national institution so it should cause a rethink for central banks and sovereign wealth funds as it’s been assumed so far that these assets were relatively immune,” said Quijano-Evans.  At the heart of the case is a years-long legal row between businessman Stati, his son Gabriel, two family-controlled companies and the Kazakh government of President Nursultan Nazarbayev.  They invested in Kazakhstan’s oil and gas industry and have asserted that they were subjected to significant harassment from the state aimed at forcing them to sell their investments cheaply. Kazakhstan denies the allegations, but Anatolie and Gabriel Stati and two of their companies – Ascom Group S.A. and Terra Raf Trans Traiding Ltd., won an international arbitration award of around $500 million against the government. It has refused to pay, however, and in October Kazakhstan filed a civil racketeering lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., against the Statis and their two firms. The central bank, the National Bank, also filed a lawsuit against BNY Mellon challenging the asset freeze. However, the claim was dismissed by a judge in London on Thursday. A spokeswoman for the Bank of New York Mellon declined to comment. Kazakhstan’s justice ministry could not be reached for comment. The freezing of the assets comes weeks after President Nazarbayev threatened to sack his cabinet if they failed to make large state companies bring back cash held abroad. Nazarbayev, who wields sweeping powers in the oil-rich nation, poured scorn on private sector executives who, he suggested, were enjoying lavish lifestyles while keeping funds in foreign accounts.
