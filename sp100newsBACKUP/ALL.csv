1,ALL,Allstate Q2 disaster losses total $2.3 billion,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Allstate Corp (ALL.N) suffered catastrophe losses of $2.3 billion in the second quarter, its worst disaster hit in six years, the largest publicly traded U.S. home and auto insurer said on Wednesday.  Allstate began releasing monthly catastrophe losses in April after analysts pressed it for more disclosure on its disaster results. The company suffered losses of $1.4 billion in April, $600 million in May and $300 million in June.  Taken together, those pretax losses are the worst since the third quarter of 2005, when Hurricane Katrina struck. They also exceed Allstate’s catastrophe losses for all of 2010.  Like most property insurers, Allstate has been hurt by severe thunderstorms that struck in April and May, as well as droughts, forest fires and floods.  For the industry as a whole, severe weather events in just one week in late May  result in insured losses of $4 billion to $7 billion, according to risk modeling agency AIR Worldwide.  The two major U.S. tornado outbreaks in May and April were the costliest in history, the agency has said.  Allstate shares opened 23 cents higher at $30.21.

6,ALL,Allstate drops after top executive replaced,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Allstate Corp (ALL.N) shares fell to nearly a year low on Monday after a senior executive left the largest publicly traded U.S. home and auto insurer, and analysts said the pressure was on management to produce results.  Allstate fell as much as 5.5 percent to $27.84, its lowest level since August 2010. Over the last 10 weeks, the stock has lost about 15 percent of its value amid a steady stream of bad news on disaster losses.  In a brief statement on Monday, the company said the president of its Allstate Protection unit, Joseph Lacher, would leave immediately. Lacher oversaw all of Allstate’s property and casualty insurance operations.  With Lacher out, Allstate said the heads of the various units formerly under him would now report directly to Chief Executive Officer Tom Wilson.  Langen McAlenney analysts, in a note to clients, said they believed Wilson was unhappy with the declining results in that business, but they also said investors would be unhappy to see Lacher leave.  “Allstate management is now under the gun to report improved results,” analyst Robert Glasspiegel said.  But he noted that, at a valuation of 0.8 times book value, Allstate shares were already pricing in all of the bad news.

7,ALL,MetLife puts banking operations up for sale,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - MetLife (MET.N), the largest life insurance company in the United States, has put its banking operations up for sale to avoid the “too big to fail” regulatory scrutiny that analysts have said was likely.  MetLife said on Thursday it may sell MetLife Bank’s depository business, which includes savings and money market accounts. The company said it will still write home mortgages; life insurers tend to like mortgages as part of a diversified investment portfolio.  MetLife has hired Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), which ran the recent sale process for larger online bank ING Direct USA, to handle the sale. One industry source said many of the companies that lost out on ING Direct may look at MetLife Bank, among them Ally Financial and CIT Group (CIT.N).  Ally and CIT declined to comment.  One difference in this deal, a second industry source said, is that many of MetLife Bank’s customers are also customers of the life insurance business, raising questions about whether they would keep their deposits with the bank in the event it was sold.  As of June 30 MetLife was the seventh-largest bank holding company in the United States by total assets, according to the Federal Reserve. The bank itself is, however, usually ranked outside the top 50 by deposits and generated just 2 percent of the company’s operating earnings in the first quarter.  “We do not believe it is appropriate for the overwhelming majority of our business to be governed by regulations written for banking institutions,” MetLife Chief Executive Steve Kandarian said in a statement, adding it was “imperative that MetLife be able to operate on a level playing field.”  That notion of “level playing field” has been central to the global insurance industry’s argument against the regulation of insurers as too big to fail.  The argument goes that any such regulated insurer would have higher capital requirements and tighter risk controls than its peers, forcing it to underwrite less business and be more conservative in its decision-making than competitors.  “While it remains uncertain to what extent the new financial reform regulation will impact the large life insurers, we believe the sale of (MetLife’s) bank would help it avoid stricter capital standards,” Standard & Poor’s insurance equity analyst Bret Howlett said in a note.  FBR Capital Markets said MetLife may be regulated as too big to fail even with the bank sale, but potentially under a different set of standards for non-bank entities that would be more favorable to shareholders.  U.S. regulators are finalizing criteria for which banks should be named as “systemically important financial institutions,” or SIFIs. It is unclear when regulators will actually designate the companies, but it could be later this year.  A SIFI designation comes with tough regulation from the Federal Reserve that will restrain profits, because of stricter capital and leverage requirements.  The companies will also have to submit “living wills” to regulators. These documents will have to be continually updated and offer a blueprint for how the government can quickly and orderly dismantle the companies if they start to fail.  The insurance industry has voting representation on the systemic risk council, known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council, in charge of picking SIFIs.  Because of the bank, analysts have widely expected MetLife to be one of the insurers tagged as a SIFI. Other insurers, like Allstate (ALL.N), have sold or explored selling their banks to get out of such oversight.  MetLife closed up 2.8 percent at $42.04 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.

Lawmakers were expected to vote on Monday on the White House-backed agreement, which includes spending cuts of $2.4 trillion over 10 years. The deal was seen passing the Democratic-led Senate, but faced tougher opposition in the U.S. House of Representatives, where both conservative Tea Party supporters and liberal lawmakers have criticized it. For details, see [ID:nN1E76U0F5]  Even though a default was considered unlikely by many investors, equities grew increasingly volatile as Washington was stalemated. Wall Street ended its worst week in a year last week.  ""This deal will obviously help, relative to the immediate problem of whether the government will be able to pay its bills, and that's leading to a definite relief rally here,"" said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at John Thomas Financial in New York, who added that the market was oversold following last week's losses.  S&P 500 futures SPc1 rose 16 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 soared 161 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures NDc1 jumped 27.5 points.  Gold GCZ1, seen as a safe haven in times of economic uncertainty, fell 0.7 percent following the deal, while September crude futures CLc1 climbed 1.8 percent. The Select Sector Energy SPDR Fund (XLE.P) rose 1.6 percent in light trading.  Even with an agreement, many investors were concerned about a possible downgrade of the United States' AAA sovereign debt rating, as well as European sovereign debt problems. Some analysts said Monday's rally in futures could be short-lived. The FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top European shares was up 0.5 percent. [MKTS/GLOB]  ""The deal lowers the odds of a downgrade, but it doesn't make it go away,"" Kaufman said. ""People still have question marks in their minds about what comes next.""  In earnings news, Allstate Corp (ALL.N) recorded a second-quarter loss as its catastrophe losses soared 268 percent, while Loews Corp (L.N) posted quarterly profits below estimates it was hit by higher catastrophe losses and lower income from its biggest holding, CNA Financial Corp (CNA.N). [ID:nL3E7J11S7] and [ID:nL3E7J11OX]  Allstate rose 2.8 percent to $28.50 in light premarket trading.  Separately, insurer Humana Inc (HUM.N) raised its full-year profit view, sending the stock up 5.6 percent to $78.78 before the bell.

16,ALL,Allstate sues Goldman over mortgage debt losses,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Allstate Corp (ALL.N) on Monday sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), accusing the Wall Street bank of causing losses by hiding the risks more than $123 million of mortgage securities it bought.  Allstate, the largest publicly traded U.S. home and auto insurer, has filed several similar lawsuits against other lenders, such as Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), to recover losses on well over $2 billion of securities it bought.  “Goldman underwrote securities using loans from subprime lenders known for issuing high risk, poor quality mortgages,” Allstate said in its complaint, citing an April report by a U.S. Senate subcommittee examining the 2008 financial crisis.

18,ALL,Allstate agent group votes to align with union," * 94 pct of 1,200 members vote in favor of deal   * Agent group will become guild allied with AFL-CIO   * Allstate says NAPAA represents small number of owners   NEW YORK, Aug 17 (Reuters) - More than 90 percent of the members of a group of independent Allstate Corp (ALL.N) insurance agents have voted to affiliate with a union, the group said on Wednesday.   The National Association of Professional Allstate Agents said 94 percent of its 1,200 members voted to align with the Office and Professional Employees International Union. Not all of those members are actually Allstate agents, though the association said they are “predominantly” so.   If the association and the union can come to terms on an agreement, the association would formally become a guild, and its members would gain membership in the nationwide AFL-CIO union.   The association has complained in past that Allstate treats agents under contract as employees even though they are classified as independent contractors, giving the company control over the agents while denying them the benefits employees receive.   The company has strenuously denied the charge and has characterized the NAPAA as a “small group” that does not have any official interaction with the company.   “This group’s vote to affiliate with the OPEIU would seem to be an internal issue for them. Their members include only a small number of Allstate’s current agency owners,” Allstate said in a statement.   It is not clear what percentage of Allstate’s total agent force the NAPAA actually represents. Until the company switched to an independent contractor model for its agent force in 2000, it had more than 6,000 agents as employees.

19,ALL,Analysis: Hurricane could boost insurance pricing,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene, threatening to become the first hurricane to hit the United States in three years, could be the catalyst the insurance industry has been seeking in its quest for across-the-board premium increases after years of weakness.  Like speculators in the futures market who applaud the effects of drought on wheat prices, another disaster could ultimately cheer investors in insurance and reinsurance stocks. Major storms in 2004 and 2005 triggered a surge in insurance stocks after the fact.  Since Hurricane Ike in 2008, though, the United States has enjoyed relatively mild weather by disaster standards, up to this year.  Weather-tracking maps on Monday suggest Irene could make landfall as soon as late Thursday. Though the tools are less reliable in advance of 72 hours from landfall, some models forecast that the Carolinas are vulnerable to a major storm with winds in excess of 110 miles per hour.  Regardless, 2011 already promises to be the costliest year in history for natural disasters around the globe.  By some estimates, insurers have lost as much as $90 billion already this year, 20 percent more than they lost in 2009 and 2010 combined. Insurers have not been able to raise rates for three years amid strong competition and readily available supply, but industry veterans say even a small storm now would be enough to trigger premium hikes.  “It wouldn’t take much of a material event to cause significant firming,” said Gary Prestia, chief executive of the U.S. business at global reinsurer Flagstone Re. “It wouldn’t take the typical $40 billion Katrina to push this into a firmer market than it is currently.”  If prices firm, then analysts say it is a fair bet that share prices will follow.  Most property and casualty insurers are now trading at historically depressed multiples of their book value. Property insurance stocks at their peak typically trade at two times book value, according to analysts at Barclays Capital. At a sector median of 0.83 times book today, according to Thomson Reuters data, that makes them cheap.  Historically, shares of reinsurance companies, which insure the insurers, lose value during typical late summer and early fall hurricane seasons but rally sharply after major storms, according to an August 22 research report from JMP Securities. Share prices across the sector rose, on average, about 32 percent in 2004 and 20 percent in 2005.  “We see similar upside going into the heart of the 2011 hurricane season as we believe a modest windstorm ($20 billion) could have a significant impact on rates that would normally follow a $50+ billion event,” analyst Matthew Carletti wrote.  Shares of many of the largest insurers and reinsurers based in Bermuda are down sharply this year despite the active hurricane season. ACE Ltd, XL Group, PartnerRe and Everest Re are down between 10 and 24 percent since June 1.  Whether Irene wreaks the $15 billion damage mark that can turn the market depends to a great degree on where it hits. A weak Category 1 hurricane in Miami would probably not have enough power to trigger rate hikes.  On the other hand, any catastrophe modeling company will say that a Category 4 or greater hurricane in Miami —storms can ascend as high as Category 5 — would be devastating.  The U.S. National Hurricane Center’s five-day forecast showed the first hurricane of the 2011 Atlantic season swinging up Florida’s east coast on Thursday for possible landfall in South Carolina on Saturday.  “If the forecasts are verified by the actual event, this’ll just be another multibillion-dollar event on top of an incredibly busy year already,” said Jose Miranda, a senior executive at catastrophe modeling company Eqecat.  “Hurricane season is only one-third over and we’ve already had almost a full year’s activity on average already,” said Miranda, a meteorologist.  The Carolinas, which were ravaged in September 1989 by Hurricane Hugo, one of the 10 worst natural disasters in the United States, are particularly vulnerable. The coastal population of the two states more than doubled between 1960 and 2008, according to U.S. census data. South Carolina has successfully wooed private insurers but its northern neighbor has been less successful, insurance executives say.  The Insurance Information Institute earlier this summer reported that the potential loss exposure of the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association — the state-created insurer of last resort — increased 60 percent in the last six years.  The NCIUA, which says it can cover up to $4 billion in losses, is funded by insurers that operate in North Carolina and share losses equally in a disaster. Any payouts beyond that could force the group to issue bonds, it has said.  Among the biggest members, by percentage share of liability, are State Farm, Nationwide and Allstate.  NCIUA on Monday said the approach of Irene could lead its members to stop writing new policies or impose restrictions on existing ones in the next two days.  Insurers have complained for years that the North Carolina consortium is underfunded and could be undermined by a once-in-50-years type of windstorm. (Insurers consider a one-in-100 year storm a benchmark of serious disaster.)  Some worst-case scenarios are covered by catastrophe bonds, which insurers and reinsurers use to transfer risk to outside investors. The percentage of the “cat bond” market with exposure to U.S. hurricane risk has grown from 38 percent in 2003 to 71 percent today, according to broker Guy Carpenter.

20,ALL,UPDATE 1-Marsh: Insurance rate declines have stopped,"   * Turn in property rates follows 18 months of declines   * Rate up 1.1 pct in average renewal so far in Q3   * Hurricane Irene could push rates much higher  (Adds A.M. Best loss figures)   NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Property insurance rates have stopped falling after 18 months of steady declines, as natural disasters begin to give insurers more pricing power, insurance brokerage Marsh said on Tuesday.   So far in the third quarter, the average property insurance renewal has been done at a 1.1 percent rate increase, Marsh said. In the worst of the downturn, renewal rates were averaging declines of more than 5 percent a quarter.   Pricing power has been a problem for the insurance industry in recent years as excess capacity and heavy competition have kept rates falling, in some cases to lows last seen a decade ago or more.   But natural disasters over the last year — including three earthquakes in New Zealand, the March quake and nuclear disaster in Japan, and tornadoes in the United States — appear to have turned the tide.   Insurance ratings agency A.M. Best said on Tuesday that U.S. property and casualty insurers suffered $27 billion in insured losses in the first half of 2011, nearly 50 percent greater than the losses for all of 2010.   The primary catalyst was tornadoes, particularly the record-breaking ones that struck in April and May.   Industry executives and analysts are now closely watching Hurricane Irene, which is expected to make landfall in the United States this weekend.

23,ALL,UPDATE 1-Virginia quake losses less than $100 mln -Eqecat," NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The earthquake that struck Virginia and rattled the Eastern United States on Tuesday caused less than $100 million in insured losses, catastrophe modeling company Eqecat said.   Eqecat said the relatively weak nature of the earthquake kept losses from being worse. Had the quake been a magnitude 7 instead of a roughly magnitude 6 temblor, insured losses would have been more than 20 times higher, it said.   The company, whose models are used by insurance companies to predict losses and plan coverage, said its data suggest minor damage would be more common in the affected areas than significant structural damage.   Disastrous earthquakes around the world have rocked the insurance industry in the last few months; prices have started turning higher after years of declining rates for coverage. The March quake in Japan alone caused tens of billions of dollars in insured losses and hundreds of billions in economic losses.

24,ALL,Irene losses start to mount as storm aims at NYC,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene is likely to cause more insured losses in the Bahamas than 1999’s devastating Hurricane Floyd, catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide said on Thursday, even as the storm increasingly tracks toward a weekend landfall in the greater New York City area.  Floyd was one of the strongest tropical cyclones on record when it hit the Bahamas more than a decade ago, and it later prompted one of the largest evacuations in U.S. history as well. AIR said Irene’s path through the Bahamas made greater damage than Floyd more likely.  More detailed estimates are expected on Friday, as the storm passes over the islands and begins to take aim at the Eastern United States.  While Irene has a long way to travel, and a great deal of uncertainty still remains, more and more computer models on Thursday suggested the storm would come very close to New York City or perhaps even pass directly over it.  The last hurricane known to have made landfall in the city proper was in 1821, causing a 13 feet storm surge that inundated the entirety of lower Manhattan. City officials said they are considering evacuations.  Beyond New York City and Long Island, the storm looks set to hit large swaths of New England with heavy rains and wind, potentially including Boston.  “If it follows its exact tracking you may not see exact hurricane-force winds in the Manhattan area, it may be more strong tropical storm-type stuff,” said James Aman, senior meteorologist at Earth Networks. “Certainly the south shore of Long Island seems to be the area that’s most under the gun right now. A lot of (Northeast U.S.) areas will see high-end tropical storm conditions here by the end of the weekend.”  Aman said there is a chance, based on the current tracks, that a Category 1 hurricane could make landfall Sunday afternoon right around the area of JFK Airport, one of the country’s most important.  One expert in disaster modeling said it would be hard for New York, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Massachusetts to escape significant damage.  “I would be surprised if New England completely gets by without any damage on this one,” said Peter Dailey, director of atmospheric science for AIR, one of the three companies insurance companies rely on to model their exposure to disasters.  Dailey said storm surge was a particularly important issue for the Northeast, with low-lying areas susceptible to flooding if the hurricane pushes the waters up substantially.  Much will depend, he said, on timing — tides are expected to be especially high on Sunday night, so if the storm hits then, flooding could be exacerbated.  Shares in property insurers were about 3 percent lower on Thursday, a sharper decline than the broader markets, as the storm moved closer.

25,ALL,Irene losses start to mount as storm aims at NYC,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene is likely to cause more insured losses in the Bahamas than 1999’s devastating Hurricane Floyd, catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide said on Thursday, even as the storm increasingly tracks toward a weekend landfall in the greater New York City area.  Floyd was one of the strongest tropical cyclones on record when it hit the Bahamas more than a decade ago, and it later prompted one of the largest evacuations in U.S. history as well. AIR said Irene’s path through the Bahamas made greater damage than Floyd more likely.  More detailed estimates are expected on Friday, as the storm passes over the islands and begins to take aim at the Eastern United States.  While Irene has a long way to travel, and a great deal of uncertainty still remains, more and more computer models on Thursday suggested the storm would come very close to New York City or perhaps even pass directly over it.  The last hurricane known to have made landfall in the city proper was in 1821, causing a 13 feet storm surge that inundated the entirety of lower Manhattan. City officials said they are considering evacuations.  Beyond New York City and Long Island, the storm looks set to hit large swaths of New England with heavy rains and wind, potentially including Boston.  “If it follows its exact tracking you may not see exact hurricane-force winds in the Manhattan area, it may be more strong tropical storm-type stuff,” said James Aman, senior meteorologist at Earth Networks. “Certainly the south shore of Long Island seems to be the area that’s most under the gun right now. A lot of (Northeast U.S.) areas will see high-end tropical storm conditions here by the end of the weekend.”  Aman said there is a chance, based on the current tracks, that a Category 1 hurricane could make landfall Sunday afternoon right around the area of JFK Airport, one of the country’s most important.  One expert in disaster modeling said it would be hard for New York, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Massachusetts to escape significant damage.  “I would be surprised if New England completely gets by without any damage on this one,” said Peter Dailey, director of atmospheric science for AIR, one of the three companies insurance companies rely on to model their exposure to disasters.  Dailey said storm surge was a particularly important issue for the Northeast, with low-lying areas susceptible to flooding if the hurricane pushes the waters up substantially.  Much will depend, he said, on timing — tides are expected to be especially high on Sunday night, so if the storm hits then, flooding could be exacerbated.  Shares in property insurers were about 3 percent lower on Thursday, a sharper decline than the broader markets, as the storm moved closer. Among those most exposed are AIG, Chubb Allstate and Travelers.

27,ALL,Wall Street posts first weekly gain in more than a month,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street posted its first weekly gain in more than a month as Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke raised hopes for more stimulus for the economy at the U.S. central bank’s September meeting.  Initially stocks fell after Bernanke stopped short of describing detailed plans to strengthen the ailing economy. But the market turned higher, led by technology shares, as investors concluded the Fed was leaving the door open for action even though many traders believe it has limited power to pull the economy out of a rut.  The CBOE Volatility Index or VIX .VIX, Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” retreated after days of uncertainty on what Bernanke would say. The VIX slid 10.2 percent to 35.69, after earlier falling as much as 14 percent to a session low at 34.33.  “He didn’t give the market the green light for QE3. He also didn’t give the market the red light for QE3,” said Kevin Caron, market strategist at Stifel, Nicolaus in Florham Park, New Jersey, referring to a possible third round of quantitative easing.  “By implying that inflation is viewed as not a concern, it leaves the possibility for something down the road,” he said.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI ended up 134.72 points, or 1.21 percent, at 11,284.54. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 17.53 points, or 1.51 percent, at 1,176.80. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 60.22 points, or 2.49 percent, at 2,479.85.  For the week, the Dow rose 4.3 percent, the S&P gained 4.7 percent and the Nasdaq rose 5.9 percent.  Bernanke, speaking in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, said the central bank’s policy panel would meet for two days in September instead of the scheduled one-day meeting to discuss any more stimulus.  While expressing long-term optimism, Bernanke said the Fed found recent developments troubling and saw a low inflation as staying low.  Shares of property insurers were mixed after falling earlier in the week on worries that severe damage from Hurricane Irene would result in substantial claims.  Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) edged up 0.6 percent to $48.29 after earlier hitting a two-year low. Allstate (ALL.N) was up 0.1 percent at $24.45, having also hit a two-year low. Insurers typically fall before severe weather events and rally later.  Chubb Corp (CB.N) gained 1.2 percent to $59.38.  As Irene bore down on North Carolina, tens of thousands of people evacuated and East Coast cities, including New York, braced for a weekend hit from the powerful storm.  NYSE Euronext NYX.N said the New York Stock Exchange plans to open for trading as usual next week, but because of the possibility of flooding, a decision will not be made until Saturday or Sunday.  Technology stocks led the advance, with Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O) among the Dow’s top gainers.  Cisco shares rose 1.6 percent to $15.32, while Microsoft shares added 2.8 percent to $25.25, and Intel Corp advanced 1.8 percent to $19.77.  The S&P information technology index .GSPT shot up 2.3 percent, making it the S&P 500’s best-performing sector.  “It’s a pretty broad market rally right now, but tech has been really hammered in the selloff, so you see that leading the rally,” said Gary Wedbush, head of trading at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles.  Tiffany and Co (TIF.N) rose 9.3 percent to $69.01 after it raised its full-year profit outlook.

31,ALL,"As Hurricane Irene bears down, investors place their bets","NEW YORK (Reuters) - While people in New York and the rest of the U.S. East Coast buy batteries and water ahead of Hurricane Irene, some investors are more focused on placing their bets just in case this really is “the big one.”  Insurance, construction, and home improvement are sectors that may find investors on either the long or short side as Hurricane Irene arrives this weekend.  Part of the positioning is to protect wealth while some investors place grimmer bets that this storm could cause billions of dollars in property and infrastructure damage.  One bleary-eyed senior trader at a proprietary trading firm in New York, already tired out after weeks of extreme volatility in markets, eyed satellite images of the impending hurricane with an air of disbelief.  “I haven’t seen it all but I’ve come pretty close to seeing it all,” he said. “I can’t remember a time when I’ve seen so much going on ... everyone who is managing money has some kind of contingency plan.”  Fifty-five million people are potentially in Hurricane Irene’s path, from the Carolinas to Cape Cod on the U.S. East Coast. Tens of thousands are evacuating as cities including New York and Washington brace for the powerful storm to hit.  One of the odder value plays may be insurance companies. They historically sell off into severe weather events then rally as storms pass and expectations grow that pricing power will improve for those companies.  Shares of insurers, such as Allstate Insurance Co and The Chubb Corp, slipped on Thursday, and could present an opportunity for exchange-traded fund investors, said Todd Rosenbluth, an analyst with Standard & Poor’s equity research division.  “Even if nothing happens, people are thinking more about protecting themselves from the next big weather-related event,” Rosenbluth said.  The largest insurance ETF is the $155.5 million SPDR KBW Insurance ETF.  Investors who are willing to pay a little more for a “quasi-active ETF, should look at the PowerShares Dynamic Insurance ETF,” said John Spence, Web editor at ETF Trends, an ETF research site.  “PIC gives you a bit of a chance at outperformance with its quasi-active management,” Spence said. However, the ETF has an expense ratio of 0.63 percent, compared to KIC, which costs 0.35 percent, according to Morningstar Inc.  A construction ETF worth considering in light of the hurricane are the Industrials Select Sector SPDR, which is diversified but does have top holdings in Caterpillar Inc. and Cummins Inc, Rosenbluth said.  Investors looking for a more concentrated construction ETF can buy the $57.8 million First Trust ISE Global Engineering & Construction Index ETF, he said. “It’s a relatively small ETF, but it has 85 percent in construction and engineering.  After Hurricane Katrina, the industrials sector did very well, and that could be another good play right now, said Robert Goldsborough, an ETF analyst at Morningstar.  The iShares Dow Jones US Industrial ETF, the Industrial Select Sector SPDR are two examples of ETFs in this sector.  For doomsayers who don’t believe the National Weather Service’s predictions that there is only a small chance New York City may get a direct hit by the hurricane, shorting financial ETFs may be a good short-term play, Goldsborough said.  “If New York City is paralyzed, so too would be the entire financial services industry,” he said.  SMALL-CAPS  Some smaller cap stocks may be well-positioned to take advantage of any storm preparation techniques as well as rebuilding efforts in the aftermath.  “You could probably get some benefit to the building product companies, the retailers or roofing related companies — some lumber companies,” said Will Nasgovitz, co-manager of the Heartland Select Value Fund in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Initially stocks fell after Bernanke stopped short of detailing plans to strengthen the ailing economy. But the market turned higher as investors surmised the Fed was leaving the door open for action.  ""He didn't give the market the green light for QE3. He also didn't give the market the red light for QE3,"" said Kevin Caron, market strategist at Stifel, Nicolaus in Florham Park, New Jersey, referring to a possible third round of quantitative easing.  ""By implying that inflation is viewed as not a concern, it leaves the possibility for something down the road,"" he said.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 141.38 points, or 1.27 percent, at 11,291.20. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 16.72 points, or 1.44 percent, at 1,175.99. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 53.05 points, or 2.19 percent, at 2,472.68.  Bernanke, speaking in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, said the central bank's policy panel would meet for two days in September instead of the scheduled one day to discuss any more stimulus.  While expressing long-term optimism, Bernanke said the Fed found recent developments troubling and saw a low inflation rate. For details, see [nN1E77O1LR]  ""The Jackson Hole vigil now becomes the September FOMC vigil,"" Caron said.  Shares of property insurers rose after falling on worries about damage from Hurricane Irene. Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) rose 0.5 percent to $48.23, while Allstate Corp (ALL.N) shares gained 0.5 percent to $24.57, and Chubb Corp (CB.N) climbed 1.3 percent to $59.40.  As Irene bore down on North Carolina, tens of thousands of people evacuated and East Coast cities, including New York, braced for a weekend hit from the powerful storm.

34,ALL,Insurers start to total up Irene damage,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Insurance adjusters are already moving into some of the areas hit by Hurricane Irene, which early indications suggest was as bad as people feared but not as devastating as some other storms to hit the Carolinas.  But as the storm moves up the U.S. East Coast, it is presenting a greater flooding risk than some had expected. With the overwhelming majority of flood insurance in the United States written by the government’s National Flood Insurance Program, that storm surge could turn out to be a huge headache for Washington at a time of deficit-cutting pressure.  Catastrophe modelers say Irene caused up to $1.1 billion in insured losses just in the Caribbean, and depending on the storm’s track in New England some have said losses north of $10 billion are possible.  Eqecat, one of those companies, said on Saturday it appears Irene caused less damage in North Carolina and Virginia than 1999’s Hurricane Floyd, which the National Hurricane Center ranks as one of the 15 costliest hurricanes ever.  A spokesman for Allstate Corp, the country’s largest publicly traded home and auto insurer, said the storm has been as bad as the company expected.  “I’ve got to imagine we’re going to see some evidence of property damage, auto damage down along the North Carolina area,” Brett Ludwig said.  While people appear to have prepared as much as they could in coastal areas, Ludwig — who was in the field for legendary hurricanes like Katrina, Rita and Gustav — said there was much less evidence inland that people had made preparations such as boarding up windows to harden property for the storm.  An agent for State Farm, the country’s largest property insurer, said he was surprised at the intensity of the wind and the duration of the storm, but he added that Irene so far seemed to have done less damage than 1996’s Hurricane Fran or 1999’s Floyd.  “There’s a lot of trees down, a lot of power outages, a lot of shingles missing but I didn’t see any huge structural damage as we saw in Fran,” said David Hull, whose Jacksonville, North Carolina home had already been without power for 14 hours. He said utility company crews were already out in his neighborhood assessing damage.  While Irene’s intensity was diminishing, meteorologists say its size and speed make up for any decrease in the winds. Forecasters for the ABC affiliate in New York said on Saturday the storm surge from Irene will be higher than expected, perhaps 5 to 8 feet in the city itself.  With an unusually high tide expected on Sunday, the surge could be made that much worse.  New York is one of the most heavily insured states by the National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP. As of June 30, according to government statistics, the program had $8.61 billion of insurance in force on nearly 38,000 policies just in New York City.  Cities across Long Island are also heavily insured, with at least six towns with more than $1 billion in insurance policies in force.  By way of comparison, the NFIP’s administrator, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, paid out more than $11 billion in claims after Hurricane Katrina.

36,ALL,Early estimates suggest Irene losses tame,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene caused between $200 million and $400 million in insured losses in the Carolinas, catastrophe modeling company EQECAT said on Sunday, suggesting the storm may have been far less severe than the insurance industry feared.  The bigger question, though, is how much coverage people have for the severe flooding that struck New York and New Jersey, and whether the federal government’s flood program can handle all of the claims.  EQECAT said the bulk of the losses it has seen so far come particularly from storm surge and flooding.  Combined with its estimate of $300 million to $600 million in insured losses from a direct hit on parts of the Caribbean, EQECAT now puts Irene’s total damage so far in a range of $500 million to $1 billion.  That is far less than its competitor, AIR Worldwide, which estimated Irene’s damages in the Caribbean at $1.1 billion.  It is not unusual for catastrophe modeling companies, whose software is used by insurers to model their exposure to natural disasters, to differ widely in their initial loss estimates.  The figures tend to be revised as the days go by and the companies send more teams to the disaster sites to survey losses first-hand.  Still, the early figures compare with some projections by meteorologists and statisticians that Irene could be a $10 billion or more event. Much will depend on how much damage the storm did in the greater New York area.  Loss estimates on the rest of the U.S. East Coast are expected on Monday.  Nationwide Mutual, one of the country’s largest property insurers, said it received 6,000 claims calls on Sunday, which is twice what it would usually expect on the Sunday after a major storm.  A spokeswoman for the company said that presents a mystery that could take days to clarify.  They can not tell yet whether they are getting an unusually high volume of claims, which would imply a lot of storm damage, or whether more people are calling than usual because they have already gotten home after the storm, which would imply it was somewhat mild.  “Generally what we’re seeing as you move east is a lot of trees on houses, widespread power outages and as you get closer and closer to the coast, we’ve got coastal flooding, the power outages are even more widespread,” said Brian Maness, a claims manager for the company in North Carolina.  In New Jersey, the state is expecting damage in “the billions of dollars, if not in the tens of billions of dollars,” Gov. Chris Christie told NBC’s “Meet the Press.”  By all accounts, in cities like Jersey City, Montclair, Nutley and Hoboken, that damage will come in large part from flooding that put in some cases multiple feet of water into homes.  New Jersey is the fourth-most insured state by the National Flood Insurance Program, which writes almost all of the flood insurance in the United States.  The state has $51.88 billion of insurance in force from the NFIP, and Jersey City and Hoboken are two of the most insured cities in the state. On the other hand, for example, Montclair and Nutley are two of the least.  Congress is working on a reform package for the NFIP, which has been surviving on a series of one-year extensions amid a debate about the cost of the program and its role in keeping the private sector largely out of the flood insurance business.

39,ALL,Irene losses less than once feared,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene caused $3 billion to $6 billion in insured losses, catastrophe modeling company AIR Worldwide said on Monday, affirming the insurance industry’s suspicion the impact was not as bad as feared.  In the days leading up to Irene, some had expected a $10 billion hit, though as Irene actually made land it appeared the storm was not doing the damage it was expected to do. AIR, whose estimate covers U.S. onshore properties, develops software that insurers use to model exposure to disasters.  Insurance shares rallied sharply on Monday, far outpacing the broader market, on relief the payouts would not be as bad as they could have been.  Even so, some analysts said the storm may have been something of a worst-case scenario for large U.S. property insurers such as Allstate Corp and Travelers Companies Inc, enough to wipe out some or all of their third-quarter earnings, but not enough to cause an industrywide increase in prices after years of weakness.  Allstate shares rose 8.5 percent and Travelers rose 5.1 percent, in line with European insurers, which rose on relief the damage from Irene was not as bad as feared. Twenty of the 22 companies in the S&P insurance index outperformed the broader market.  Millions of people throughout the Northeastern United States were still flooded and without electricity on Monday, particularly in rural Vermont and suburban New Jersey. Totaling those losses is expected to take time, as is the process of figuring out how many of the affected had government-backed flood insurance.  By some accounts, the insured losses in the Carolinas were as little as $200 million after the storm made landfall there Saturday.  Before the hurricane, some feared Irene could be a $10 billion event or more. Analysts and insurance executives suggested something above $15 billion could bring a structural change to the insurance market, pushing prices higher around the world after three years of weakness.  It seemed unlikely Irene would hit that mark, with trade groups such as the Insurance Information Institute and the Property and Casualty Insurers of America saying estimates below $5 billion sounded right.  “The impact to insurers from Irene is probably not large enough to cause increased pricing and will not result in a broad (property and casualty) cycle turn because we estimate there is still least $100 billion of excess U.S. P&C industry capital,” Barclays Capital said in a note on Monday.  Between the Caribbean and the Carolinas, AIR competitor Eqecat has estimated losses of no more than $1 billion. AIR Worldwide has previously forecast losses of $1.1 billion just for the Caribbean. The third key player in catastrophe modeling for the insurance industry, RMS, has not weighed in with a figure.  On Monday, RMS did say the damage so far is much more likely to be from flood and storm surge than wind, which would get the insurance industry off the hook for most of the losses and push the payout burden onto the National Flood Insurance Program.  The shares of the world’s top three reinsurers — Munich Re, Swiss Re and Hannover Re — rose 4 to 6 percent as analysts said they did not expect that any losses would force a change to 2011 estimates.

41,ALL,Wall Street surges 2 percent on Greek bank deal; trade thin,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks soared more than 2 percent in a broad rally on Monday as a merger between two big Greek banks provided a rare bit of encouraging news out of debt-stricken Europe.  A rebound in consumer spending calmed fears of a new U.S. recession and also helped lift all 10 S&P sectors. Only five S&P stocks ended in negative territory while the CBOE Volatility index .VIX, a measure of investor fear, lost 9.3 percent. But volume was low, amplifying the surge in shares.  Financial stocks were the top gainers after Greek banks Alpha (ACBr.AT) and EFG Eurobank EFGr.AT sealed a merger with help from Qatar, shoring up a sector battered by the euro zone’s debt crisis.  Insurers also rose sharply as property damage from Hurricane Irene was less than feared, according to early estimates.  The Greek deal consolidates the number of weak banks in the region and reduces the risk from one potential flashpoint that could reignite the smoldering euro zone debt crisis, which has been hanging over the global financial system. In addition, the foreign investment is a sign that investors view the region as undervalued.  “Many have come to see Greece as a lost cause, so to have a merger potentially making a strong (bank) in Greece indicates that it isn’t as dire a situation as might otherwise have been assumed,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland, Ohio.  With public transport still struggling to return to service in New York on Monday after the area’s brush with Hurricane Irene, many Wall Street firms were understaffed, contributing to the lightest volume in a month. About 6.5 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, below last year’s daily average of 8.47 billion.  “The bears stayed home in what remains a wait-and-see market, but the light volume exacerbated the day’s move,” said Dick Del Bello, senior partner at Conifer Group, a hedge fund service provider in New York. “That vacuum of light volume is allowing us to rise nicely.”  Among insurers, Dow component Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) gained 5/1 percent to $50.75, while Allstate Corp (ALL.N) jumped 8.5 percent to $26.30 and Progressive Corp (PGR.N) rose 3.6 percent to $18.89. The iShares Dow Jones U.S. Insurance Index Fund (IAK.P) rose 5.3 percent.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 254.71 points, or 2.26 percent, at 11,539.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 33.28 points, or 2.83 percent, at 1,210.08. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 82.26 points, or 3.32 percent, at 2,562.11.  Consumer spending recorded its largest increase in five months in July, supporting views the economy was not falling back into recession. And while the number of signed contracts for home sales fell 1.3 percent in July, the decline matched forecasts and managed to top year-ago levels.  “Consumer spending has been in focus in the past couple of months, so any kind of strength there is a good thing for the economy and the market,” said Brian Lazorishak, portfolio manager at Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.  Traders were also relieved that hurricane damage in New York City, especially in lower Manhattan, was not nearly as bad as had been feared.  The S&P financial index .GSPF was up 4.2 percent and the KBW Banks index .BKX added 4.5 percent. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) rose 8.1 percent to $8.39 and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) gained 3.9 percent to $37.64.  U.S.-listed shares of National Bank of Greece NBG.N soared 38 percent to $1.15, while European shares ended up 1.3 percent.  LDK Solar Co LTD LDK.N rose 5.8 percent to $6.18 after it forecast third-quarter revenue above expectations.  About 90 percent of issues traded on the New York Stock Exchange ended in positive territory, while on the Nasdaq, 85 percent of stocks ended higher.

43,ALL,UPDATE 2-Hurricane Irene: Are you set to fight your insurer?," (Updates with new headline, sends to additional subscribers)   By Linda Stern   WASHINGTON, Aug 29 (Reuters) - The morning after Hurricane Irene blew through their Takoma Park, Maryland, neighborhood, homeowners Michael Desautels and Susan Hearn awoke to find a giant holly-leafed cherry tree nestled precariously in some broken tiles on their roof.   Hearn called State Farm, the company that holds their homeowners policy and boasts on its web site, “we’re here to help... Ready to respond to Hurricane Irene.”   After the usual press-one-press-two roundabout, she heard a recorded message: “We are experiencing extremely high call volumes, please call back later.” Click. And Hearn was disconnected. She finally got through to her insurance company the following day.   Sigh. With more than a million homeowner claims and billions of dollars of damages expected to result from the storm’s violent trip up the U.S. East Coast, it’s not surprising that the path to an insurance settlement might not be smooth.   The big insurance firms have rushed into the most hard-hit areas; Allstate (ALL.N), for example, says it rushed more than 1,000 adjusters and 16 mobile claim centers into the most affected areas as soon as they were safe. State Farm says it has a 1,700-member catastrophe services response team, and has sent a first wave of 1,000 adjusters to the East Coast.   “We definitely had a very high call volume yesterday, but I’ve not heard of any problems today,” said Jeff McCollum, a State Farm spokesman. “We do ‘triage’ the claim calls and make every effort to get to those with the most severe damage first,” he said.   But attorneys and consumer representatives who have experience with disasters and insurance companies warn that homeowners could get soaked more than once.   “The real problem arises after a catastrophe because there is such a discrepancy between the hundreds of thousands of dollars at issue for the homeowner and the insurance company, which has millions or billions of dollars at issue,” said Richard T. Phillips, a Batesville, Mississippi, attorney who represented homeowners who sued their insurers following Hurricane Katrina.   “Homeowners just need to realize that they are operating in an adversarial situation,” he said. “Katrina proved it is naive to think the insurance company is going to pay what it should.”   That doesn’t mean every claim will turn into a nightmare. Even Phillips concedes that many small and straightforward claims are resolved simply and directly by insurance company adjusters. And Robert Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America, said “Not all insurance companies handle claims badly, so go into the claims process with an open mind.”   But it probably makes sense to keep those eyes wide open too. Here’s a quick review of where trouble may lurk.   Other than total demolition by fire, water causes more expensive and severe damage than most other hazards. But if that damage is caused by flooding — typically defined as water that seeps (or rushes) into your house from the ground — that damage might not be covered at all.   Typically homes in flood plains do carry federal flood insurance; lenders usually require it. The federal flood insurance program was created as a way to get coverage for homes in flood plains; its premiums are subsidized.   Usually, the federal flood insurance program is serviced by private insurers, so a homeowner who does have federal flood insurance may file the claim with the company that holds their homeowners policy.   But private homeowners insurance hardly ever covers flood damage, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Homeowners who don’t live in flood plains have to hunt out the federal program and buy their own flood insurance, and they usually don’t.   So finding out your flooded basement isn’t covered is bad enough, but when an entire house is destroyed by wind and rain and flood, it can prompt the insurer to deny the entire claim, and not just the flooded parts.   Concurrent damage by more than one cause is grounds for denying the claim, said Aviva Abramovsky, a law professor and insurance expert at Syracuse University. Case law made in the aftermath of Katrina affirmed that, she said.   But the Consumer Federation of America takes issue with those exemptions, called “anti-concurrent-causation” clauses. “CFA believes that these clauses are ambiguous, so if an insurer uses such a clause to deny your claim, read the provision carefully to see if you think it is ambiguous, and, if so, see an attorney right away,” the consumer group said in a statement released on August 26, as Irene was approaching North Carolina’s coast.   Even homeowners with federal flood insurance may not have a speedy path to full recovery. Homeowners have 30 days (unless the Federal Emergency Management Administration decides to extend that; so far they haven’t) to file comprehensive and detailed claims for their properties.   Do that thoroughly, and do it quickly, said Soren Gisleson, a New Orleans trial lawyer who has litigated several Katrina cases. He has seen homeowners miss out on money they should have received because they didn’t adequately document their claims with photos, contractor estimates and more, or because they missed that key 30-day deadline.   The insurance adjuster’s idea of how much it will cost to fix your house and the amount you actually have to spend to fix your house can differ by amounts large enough to drive a drywall truck through.   Sometimes that’s because insurance companies can rely on discounted prices at a time when supplies, like that drywall, can be marked up by post-storm demand, said Gisleson. He tells homeowners to secure at least one serious repair estimate from a licensed contractor who can actually do the work. Get a price and a date for when the work can be done. And then submit that to the insurance company, he said.   In the meantime, the more you document, the better. Photos of damaged areas, an inventory of household items that were destroyed, receipts and a log of all those phone calls can help make your case.   The Consumer Federation tells consumers who receive a low-ball estimate to use those records to complain to senior staff at the insurance company, and to also complain to their state insurance department. Folks with massive losses may also choose to get an attorney.   That attorney can call in an independent adjuster to evaluate the true cost of your home repair and pursue a lawsuit if there’s evidence the insurance company is acting in bad faith by bouncing or minimizing your claim.     Don’t expect instant cash.  While insurance companies do sometimes settle claims rapidly, especially in hard-hit areas or where claims are very clear cut, more complicated claims can take months or even years to settle.   Finally, expect to be out some money even if your claim sails through. In recent years, deductibles have gone up, and some have been switched to percentage deductibles instead of flat dollar limits.   That can leave homeowners on the hook for as much as 10 percent of a home’s value. At the same time, insurers may have capped the amount they will pay to replace a home that is completely damaged. If post-storm demand pushes up the prices of construction materials and labor, homeowners could end up facing gaps between their actual costs and the claims paid.   Once that’s all done, there’s still one more bill to be paid. Insurers can and do raise their premiums in the aftermath of crises. Perhaps that’s one reason why shares of the big insurance companies did very well today, despite those out-sized loss estimates. And it’s one more reason for homeowners to save up their money.

A rebound in consumer spending calmed fears of a new U.S. recession and also helped lift all 10 S&P sectors. Only five S&P stocks ended in negative territory while the CBOE Volatility index .VIX, a measure of investor fear, lost 9.3 percent. But volume was low, amplifying the surge in shares.  Financial stocks were the top gainers after Greek banks Alpha (ACBr.AT) and EFG Eurobank EFGr.AT sealed a merger with help from Qatar, shoring up a sector battered by the euro zone's debt crisis. For details, see [nLDE77S070]  Insurers also rose sharply as property damage from Hurricane Irene was less than feared, according to early estimates. [nN1E77S0H6]  The Greek deal consolidates the number of weak banks in the region and reduces the risk from one potential flashpoint that could reignite the smoldering euro zone debt crisis, which has been hanging over the global financial system. In addition, the foreign investment is a sign that investors view the region as undervalued.  ""Many have come to see Greece as a lost cause, so to have a merger potentially making a strong (bank) in Greece indicates that it isn't as dire a situation as might otherwise have been assumed,"" said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland, Ohio.  With public transport still struggling to return to service in New York on Monday after the area's brush with Hurricane Irene, many Wall Street firms were understaffed, contributing to the lightest volume in a month. About 6.5 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, below last year's daily average of 8.47 billion. [ID:nN1E77S005]  ""The bears stayed home in what remains a wait-and-see market, but the light volume exacerbated the day's move,"" said Dick Del Bello, senior partner at Conifer Group, a hedge fund service provider in New York. ""That vacuum of light volume is allowing us to rise nicely.""  Among insurers, Dow component Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) gained 5/1 percent to $50.75, while Allstate Corp (ALL.N) jumped 8.5 percent to $26.30 and Progressive Corp (PGR.N) rose 3.6 percent to $18.89. The iShares Dow Jones U.S. Insurance Index Fund (IAK.P) rose 5.3 percent.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 254.71 points, or 2.26 percent, at 11,539.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 33.28 points, or 2.83 percent, at 1,210.08. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 82.26 points, or 3.32 percent, at 2,562.11.  Consumer spending recorded its largest increase in five months in July, supporting views the economy was not falling back into recession. And while the number of signed contracts for home sales fell 1.3 percent in July, the decline matched forecasts and managed to top year-ago levels. [ID:nN1E77S0BS]  ""Consumer spending has been in focus in the past couple of months, so any kind of strength there is a good thing for the economy and the market,"" said Brian Lazorishak, portfolio manager at Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.  Traders were also relieved that hurricane damage in New York City, especially in lower Manhattan, was not nearly as bad as had been feared.  The S&P financial index .GSPF was up 4.2 percent and the KBW Banks index .BKX added 4.5 percent.

50,ALL,Irene losses less than once feared,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene caused $3 billion to $6 billion in insured losses, catastrophe modeling company AIR Worldwide said on Monday, affirming the insurance industry’s suspicion the impact was not as bad as feared.  In the days leading up to Irene, some had expected a $10 billion hit, though as Irene actually made land it appeared the storm was not doing the damage it was expected to do. AIR, whose estimate covers U.S. onshore properties, develops software that insurers use to model exposure to disasters.  Insurance shares rallied sharply on Monday, far outpacing the broader market, on relief the payouts would not be as bad as they could have been.  Even so, some analysts said the storm may have been something of a worst-case scenario for large U.S. property insurers such as Allstate Corp and Travelers Companies Inc, enough to wipe out some or all of their third-quarter earnings, but not enough to cause an industrywide increase in prices after years of weakness.  Allstate shares rose 8.5 percent and Travelers rose 5.1 percent, in line with European insurers, which rose on relief the damage from Irene was not as bad as feared. Twenty of the 22 companies in the S&P insurance index outperformed the broader market.  Millions of people throughout the Northeastern United States were still flooded and without electricity on Monday, particularly in rural Vermont and suburban New Jersey. Totaling those losses is expected to take time, as is the process of figuring out how many of the affected had government-backed flood insurance.  By some accounts, the insured losses in the Carolinas were as little as $200 million after the storm made landfall there Saturday.  Before the hurricane, some feared Irene could be a $10 billion event or more. Analysts and insurance executives suggested something above $15 billion could bring a structural change to the insurance market, pushing prices higher around the world after three years of weakness.  It seemed unlikely Irene would hit that mark, with trade groups such as the Insurance Information Institute and the Property and Casualty Insurers of America saying estimates below $5 billion sounded right.  “The impact to insurers from Irene is probably not large enough to cause increased pricing and will not result in a broad (property and casualty) cycle turn because we estimate there is still least $100 billion of excess U.S. P&C industry capital,” Barclays Capital said in a note on Monday.  Between the Caribbean and the Carolinas, AIR competitor Eqecat has estimated losses of no more than $1 billion. AIR Worldwide has previously forecast losses of $1.1 billion just for the Caribbean. The third key player in catastrophe modeling for the insurance industry, RMS, has not weighed in with a figure.  On Monday, RMS did say the damage so far is much more likely to be from flood and storm surge than wind, which would get the insurance industry off the hook for most of the losses and push the payout burden onto the National Flood Insurance Program.  The shares of the world’s top three reinsurers — Munich Re, Swiss Re and Hannover Re — rose 4 to 6 percent as analysts said they did not expect that any losses would force a change to 2011 estimates.  This year already was the most expensive for natural disasters, mostly because of the costs of the March earthquake in Japan.

Here’s a quick review of where trouble may lurk.  Other than total demolition by fire, water causes more expensive and severe damage than most other hazards. But if that damage is caused by flooding — typically defined as water that seeps (or rushes) into your house from the ground — that damage might not be covered at all.  Typically homes in flood plains do carry federal flood insurance; lenders usually require it. The federal flood insurance program was created as a way to get coverage for homes in flood plains; its premiums are subsidized.  Usually, the federal flood insurance program is serviced by private insurers, so a homeowner who does have federal flood insurance may file the claim with the company that holds their homeowners policy.  But private homeowners insurance hardly ever covers flood damage, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Homeowners who don’t live in flood plains have to hunt out the federal program and buy their own flood insurance, and they usually don’t.  So finding out your flooded basement isn’t covered is bad enough, but when an entire house is destroyed by wind and rain and flood, it can prompt the insurer to deny the entire claim, and not just the flooded parts.  Concurrent damage by more than one cause is grounds for denying the claim, said Aviva Abramovsky, a law professor and insurance expert at Syracuse University. Case law made in the aftermath of Katrina affirmed that, she said.  But the Consumer Federation of America takes issue with those exemptions, called “anti-concurrent-causation” clauses. “CFA believes that these clauses are ambiguous, so if an insurer uses such a clause to deny your claim, read the provision carefully to see if you think it is ambiguous, and, if so, see an attorney right away,” the consumer group said in a statement released on August 26, as Irene was approaching North Carolina’s coast.  Even homeowners with federal flood insurance may not have a speedy path to full recovery. Homeowners have 30 days (unless the Federal Emergency Management Administration decides to extend that; so far they haven’t) to file comprehensive and detailed claims for their properties.  Do that thoroughly, and do it quickly, said Soren Gisleson, a New Orleans trial lawyer who has litigated several Katrina cases. He has seen homeowners miss out on money they should have received because they didn’t adequately document their claims with photos, contractor estimates and more, or because they missed that key 30-day deadline.  The insurance adjuster’s idea of how much it will cost to fix your house and the amount you actually have to spend to fix your house can differ by amounts large enough to drive a drywall truck through.  Sometimes that’s because insurance companies can rely on discounted prices at a time when supplies, like that drywall, can be marked up by post-storm demand, said Gisleson. He tells homeowners to secure at least one serious repair estimate from a licensed contractor who can actually do the work. Get a price and a date for when the work can be done. And then submit that to the insurance company, he said.  In the meantime, the more you document, the better. Photos of damaged areas, an inventory of household items that were destroyed, receipts and a log of all those phone calls can help make your case.  The Consumer Federation tells consumers who receive a low-ball estimate to use those records to complain to senior staff at the insurance company, and to also complain to their state insurance department. Folks with massive losses may also choose to get an attorney.  That attorney can call in an independent adjuster to evaluate the true cost of your home repair and pursue a lawsuit if there’s evidence the insurance company is acting in bad faith by bouncing or minimizing your claim.  Don’t expect instant cash. While insurance companies do sometimes settle claims rapidly, especially in hard-hit areas or where claims are very clear cut, more complicated claims can take months or even years to settle.  Finally, expect to be out some money even if your claim sails through. In recent years, deductibles have gone up, and some have been switched to percentage deductibles instead of flat dollar limits.  That can leave homeowners on the hook for as much as 10 percent of a home’s value. At the same time, insurers may have capped the amount they will pay to replace a home that is completely damaged. If post-storm demand pushes up the prices of construction materials and labor, homeowners could end up facing gaps between their actual costs and the claims paid.  Once that’s all done, there’s still one more bill to be paid. Insurers can and do raise their premiums in the aftermath of crises. Perhaps that’s one reason why shares of the big insurance companies did very well today, despite those out-sized loss estimates. And it’s one more reason for homeowners to save up their money.

52,ALL,"Insurers escape Irene's wrath, economy does not","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene may heap billions of dollars of extra costs on the already fragile U.S. economy, but insurance companies are likely to emerge relatively unscathed.  Most of Irene’s damage was from flooding, which the government insures, instead of wind, which insurance companies cover, meaning insurers could pay out as little as $1.5 billion by some early estimates.  That’s just a fraction of the $10 billion to $12 billion of economic damage that Irene likely caused, according to estimates from catastrophe modelers and ratings agencies. Moody’s Analytics said the storm might take a tenth of a percentage point off third-quarter gross domestic product.  The question now for insurers is whether the insured losses are bad enough to eat up third-quarter earnings, which some analysts believe is the case, and whether the losses are enough to let insurers raise rates, which many analysts doubt.  “Obviously we’re still early in a process. For the third quarter we build pretty substantial catastrophe loads into our estimates. While there’s a wide range we feel like we’ve got some conservatism built into our numbers,” said Larry Greenberg, an analyst at Janney Capital Markets unit Langen McAlenney who covers insurers.  Insurers have already suffered big blows from other disasters this year, and their disaster losses for the first half of 2011 are well above total levels for 2010.  But figuring out how Irene will affect earnings is difficult because modeling hurricane losses is so tricky, on top of the usual challenge of forecasting insurance earnings.  For example, Dow industrials component Travelers Companies Inc (TRV.N) has reported results that are at least 20 cents different from Wall Street’s estimates for four quarters running, sometimes to the upside and sometimes to the downside.  What is clear, though, is that insurance stocks are rallying after Irene. Last week, as the storm approached and worst-case scenarios were bandied about, the insurance sector underperformed the broader market by half. This week, with the relief of a more moderate hit from Irene, insurers are at least a third better than the market in general.  “At the end of the day, last week the underperformance was the result of fear that Irene could be the storm that CNN and Weather Channel were talking about, a worst-case scenario for New York and the northeast,” said Matthew Carletti, an analyst at JMP Securities. “The fact is, the storm weakened. You still had damage, but it was pretty modest.”  Carletti said it appeared investors had been more concerned about the downside pressure a major storm could cause on earnings than the upside pressure it would exert on insurance pricing across the sector.  By many standards, Irene could have been much worse. The economic damage it wreaked was just a fraction of the damage from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 or Andrew in 1992.  But the U.S. economy is fragile now, and the hurricane hardly helps. U.S. gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of just one percentage point in the second quarter, so shaving a tenth of a percentage point off could be material.  Analysts also warned of potential inflation from what is known as “demand surge,” where people try to make repairs in short order and drive up many local prices.  For insurers, the losses could be somewhere between $1.5 billion to $2.8 billion, catastrophe modeling agency Eqecat said early Wednesday.  That is far less than the estimate from competitor AIR Worldwide, which suggested losses would range from $3 billion to $6 billion.  While it is not unusual for the two to differ in their estimates, the trend is clearly toward Irene costing the insurance industry much less than had been feared. In the days before Irene made landfall, many were predicting a $10 billion event or worse.  If AIR Worldwide is correct, Irene would rank as one of the 10 costliest hurricanes in U.S. history by level of insured losses. However, the lower end of Eqecat’s estimate would put Irene well out of that range.  That said, it is still a blow to insurers, given estimates that they suffered $27 billion in catastrophe losses in the first six months of the year — nearly 50 percent more than they lost in all of 2010.  For the last three years, when losses were less than they have been lately, insurance prices have been mostly falling, given excess capacity and heavy competition.  There have been enough natural disasters this year to eat up some of that extra capacity, such that insurance brokerage Marsh said this month price declines have stopped. But going into Irene, most analysts thought it would need to be a $15 billion event to “harden” the market, or pressure enough insurers to spur widespread price increases.  “People do get nervous about earnings and estimates cuts and instinctively tend to sell while the news is out there. The consideration of what it does to pricing happens a couple of weeks or more down the road,” Langen McAlenney’S Greenberg said.  Given the relatively limited losses, ratings agency A.M. Best said the industry should have no problem absorbing the costs. While analysts have said losses could wipe out third-quarter earnings, it appears that will be the extent of the damage, leaving insurers’ balance sheets intact.  “Despite the considerable catastrophe losses recorded through the first half of 2011, the overall (property insurance) industry remains adequately capitalized,” Best said in a report. “Accordingly, Hurricane Irene is not a solvency event from an industrywide perspective.”  Fitch Ratings also said on Wednesday that losses would be “material but manageable” for insurers and that no ratings actions were expected.  By market share, the largest insurers in the storm-hit states of New York, New Jersey and North Carolina include State Farm, Allstate Corp (ALL.N), Liberty Mutual and Chubb Corp (CB.N), according to A.M. Best.  “I think it’s difficult going into it and it’s difficult coming out of it,” said Tom Lewandowski, an analyst at Edward Jones. “It’s more important to take a longer-term outlook because (insurance) profitability doesn’t really exist on a quarter-by-quarter basis.”  ",8312011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-insurance-irene/insurers-escape-irenes-wrath-economy-does-not-idUSTRE77U5WU20110831

54,ALL,Insurance lawsuits to follow Irene,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - As the water recedes from Hurricane Irene, lawyers are expecting disputes over insurance coverage to pour in.  The biggest fights will stem from arguments over property damage and whether it resulted from wind or water, legal experts said. Similar questions arose in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina six years ago.  Disputes over the extent of coverage and the reimbursement amounts are also likely as property owners face soggy basements, shattered windows and tree-beaten roofs.  Battles over who pays for what will start funneling into state and federal courts and arbitration forums in the coming months, lawyers and scholars said.  State Farm, Allstate and Liberty Mutual are some of the bigger insurers in the affected areas. Liberty Mutual and State Farm said through spokesmen that their focus right now was efficiently handling claims from people in those regions. Allstate was not immediately available for comment.  The first step in the process will be for policyholders to make their claims.  “A flood of claims may lead to a river of litigation,” said University of Pennsylvania Law School professor Tom Baker.  Homeowners insurance policies usually cover damage from wind, but not flooding. And while mortgage providers usually require homeowners in flood-prone areas to buy separate policies through the National Flood Insurance Program, property owners in other areas, including upstate New York, Connecticut and Vermont, often do not have such insurance.  Because of the widespread and costly destruction from floods, insurers historically have not provided coverage for them.  Those who do have flood insurance may find it hard to get reimbursement from the government program, which is overburdened from Hurricane Katrina. For a Special Report on the U.S. flood insurance program, click link.reuters.com/wyf53s Insurance policies can be hyper-detailed and laws vary from state to state, so it is difficult to predict exactly when any litigation will begin.  The outcome of most cases will hinge on experts and eyewitnesses, said Wayne Lee, a partner in New Orleans-based Stone Pigman Walther Wittmann who represented insurers defending class actions after Hurricane Katrina.  One “extensively litigated” issue, he said, was whether flood insurance covered wind-driven flooding, including storm surges. Generally speaking, it didn’t.  “Courts, at least in Louisiana, said a flood is a flood,” Lee said.  More difficult questions arise when a home has been swept away. Determining the cause of the destruction is tough when nothing is left, Lee said.  Another factor that will affect the volume of litigation is whether a jurisdiction allows policyholders to recover legal fees, said Amy Bach, executive director of the consumer advocacy group United Policyholders.  Laws vary widely, however, based on factors such as the dollar amount of claims. New York, Vermont and North Carolina, for example, usually allow successful litigants to recover costs and fees, but the standards are different in each state.  “If I can’t recover my attorney’s fees, I’m probably not going to bring the case,” Bach said.  Individuals with separate policies for homeowners and flood insurance could find themselves in both state and federal courts, Lee said.  Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program. A fight over a claim made against an insurer based in the same state as the policyholder could end up in state court.  States could also consolidate lawsuits with a particular judge or establish arbitration forums, University of Pennsylvania professor Baker said.  What differentiates Irene from other hurricanes is that it struck densely populated regions of the upper East Coast, said Michael Troisi, a partner in Rivkin Radler in Uniondale, New York, who focuses on insurance defense.  With more claims being made, more disputes will arise, he said, but residents had a lot of preparation time, which may have reduced damage.  Disputes over claims are by far the exception since “insurance companies have their reputations to consider,” said Baker. Even so, he added, the lawsuits are coming and could take years to resolve.

56,ALL,Special report: Irene wallops flood insurance program,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The only thing worse than getting flooded out of your home once is getting flooded out of it twice. Or, for that matter, over and over again.  Margaret Wert bought her Wayne, New Jersey house in 1999, relying on assurances from her realtor that any occasional flooding would only amount to an inch or two of water. A week after closing, Hurricane Floyd put four feet of water in her basement.  Earlier this year, Wert, 45, got flooded again and received a payout of $5,000 on her government flood insurance, which costs her $1,200 a year. It wasn’t enough to cover her bills, but it helped with the new stove, refrigerator and boiler.  But all of Margaret Wert’s new appliances and much of her house are now ruined, after Hurricane Irene flooded broad swathes of New Jersey. This time, though, she has a message for the government insurance program.  “If they don’t buy me out and give me what I want, I am going to walk away, and they can keep it. I will tell the insurance company ‘give the check to the bank.’ You can do the repairs. You can live there in mold, you can live there in smell, I am done.”  In the United States, uniquely in the developed world, insuring homeowners against flood damage is the sole province of the federal government. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is virtually the only place to get protection against the disasters of flood and storm surge.  The problem is that the NFIP is a disaster itself, hanging on by a series of hard-fought annual extensions and the subject of a stalled reform bill in Congress. Only six years ago, taxpayers had to bail out the program after losses from Hurricane Katrina proved too much to handle.  But bailouts are not popular in Washington these days. With Congress locked in battle over the national deficit and recessionary fears looming, House Republicans are already warning that any extra money spent needs to be offset by cuts.  While Hurricane Irene was not as strong as Katrina, it has caused severe and widespread flooding in some of America’s most populated - and most expensive - areas. The storm killed at least 38 people in 11 states, in addition to three who died in the Dominican Republic and one in Puerto Rico.  In New Jersey alone, Governor Chris Christie has estimated losses could be in the tens of billions of dollars. The state has nearly $52 billion in flood insurance in force from the NFIP.  The question is whether the NFIP can handle it, and whether the losses it faces from Irene are enough to spur the U.S. Senate into passing a major reform bill that made it through the House of Representatives last month.  Moreover, if climate change believers in the insurance industry are right, and the environment is changing in unpredictable and severe ways, the flooding that results could worsen an already bad situation for the NFIP and for homeowners.  “What I do regret tremendously is because the federal government can undercut the private sector, it is now the only insurer in the floodplain management arena,” said Joe Allbaugh, the former director of FEMA under President George W. Bush, who now runs his own disaster management company.  “It spends most of its time in the red. That’s because it’s another government program (where) the premiums that are charged are way under market value, in my opinion.”  The NFIP dates to 1968, when Congress created it to help offset flood damage in quickly developing parts of the country, as well as to give communities an incentive to manage their flood risk more effectively.  From an insurance standpoint, the program is much like any other private-sector program: pay the government a certain amount and when a flood happens, receive coverage for repairs. As of June 30, the program had nearly 5.6 million policies in force with a total insured value of $1.246 trillion.  But from a fiscal standpoint FEMA does not manage the NFIP like a traditional insurer. Most insurers use a measure of solvency that looks at their capital and reserves and their ability to pay claims. In particular, regulators require insurance companies to keep a statutory reserve of liquid assets to cover potential future losses.  FEMA, on the other hand, has said it manages the NFIP to generate enough premiums to cover expenses and losses for an average loss year, rather than keeping capital for the long term. Even former agency officials admit it charges rates that dramatically underprice the risks faced.  That is all well and good in a normal year and when business is good, but when a worse-than-average loss year happens, the consequences are disastrous.  After Katrina and Rita struck in 2005, the NFIP was more or less insolvent, without the capacity to pay the huge volume of claims those hurricanes created. Congress reacted by increasing the NFIP’s borrowing ability from the U.S. Treasury more than 13-fold, to a level of nearly $21 billion.  That debt burden is, by all accounts, unsustainable. The Government Accountability Office, in a late-2006 report, said FEMA would never be able to pay off the NFIP’s debts given the level of business it was doing at the time.  While Irene was no Katrina, it comes on top of serious Midwestern flooding that the program has already had to deal with this year. Some people believe NFIP will stretch its debt boundaries and may well end up needing more assistance.  “It may be a little bit too soon to tell but it’s certainly not going to be a very good year for the NFIP and we’ve not finished the year yet,” said Robert Hartwig, an economist and the president of the Insurance Information Institute.  Hartwig said a private insurance market for flood coverage is absolutely possible, with plenty of insurers and reinsurers willing to get into the business — but only if the NFIP raises its rates and if insurers get assurances from state regulators that they will be able to do the same.  But failing those changes, the NFIP will remain the only game in town. If its already unsustainable indebtedness gets any bigger, that leaves two potential solutions to the problem: make the program bigger or forgive the debt.  The flood program would seem to have ample room to grow, given that fewer than one in 20 American households have a policy.  It is also cheap for most people. The former FEMA director Allbaugh calls it one of the best buys for taxpayers, and with average annual premiums of less than $500, it’s hard to argue.  And yet take-up is and has been anemic. Many people who buy flood insurance do so only because their mortgage lender requires them to do so as a condition of their loan. Many of them, insurance agents say, take the first opportunity they can to let the policy lapse.  “We are seeing a definite uptick in policies that are being non-renewed because people just can’t afford it,” said Patty Templeton-Jones, vice president of operations and principal NFIP coordinator at Fidelity National Indemnity Insurance Co., which is the largest writer of flood insurance policies in the United States. The NFIP largely uses private insurance companies to write and administer policies on its behalf, paying them a fee for the service.  Templeton-Jones said there is no question that Fidelity National and other flood insurance writers will see business pick up in the near term, but there is also little doubt that many of those new customers will let their policies go in two to three years, absent another disaster in their area.  Therein lies the problem, for the government and for communities that are already financially strapped: people just do not see the point of a flood policy.  Among them are Kevin Putnam’s parents. Their Brattleboro, Vermont house is now full of water, thanks to Hurricane Irene, and the potentially crushing burden of rebuilding could be stuck on their shoulders. “They have been here 50 years and this is the first time this has happened,” Putnam said. “The premium just isn’t worth it.”  Take that sentiment, multiply it across an entire town, and the result is nothing less than financial disaster.  “It’s a small state and we’re overwhelmed,” Brattleboro, Vermont town manager Barbara Sondag said. The state suffered its worst flooding in 80 years, with some 260 roads damaged or washed away entirely in the storm.  According to NFIP data as of June 30, Vermont ranks 47th of the 50 states in the number of flood policies in force, with just 1.5 percent of households covered.  In Brattleboro there are all of 99 policies on the books for a town of more than 12,000 people. Insurers like Fidelity National say there are some limited FEMA loans those people may be able to apply for, and even more limited (in size and availability) grants. But by and large, they are on their own.  If FEMA can not find a way to generate more revenue, then the only other hope for dealing with its debt is political reform. As with anything else in Washington, that is easier said than done.  In July, the U.S. House of Representatives, in a rare display of overwhelming bipartisan unity, passed an NFIP reform bill on a 406-22 vote.  The U.S. Senate, faced with the September 30 end of the current legislative session, will almost certainly not even bring that bill, or its own differing version, to a vote.  The House bill would make changes to requirements for mandatory flood purchase, as well as long-sought reforms to both the terms and rates of flood policies.  The Senate, on the other hand, is focused on its own measure, modeled on one that passed in 2008 but went nowhere thereafter. One of the cornerstones of that bill, unusually enough in the current deficit-cutting environment, is forgiveness: writing off the NFIP’s unsustainable debt entirely and essentially starting the program over from scratch.  “There is no solution that doesn’t gore somebody’s ox,” said Drew Sachs, vice president of disaster services at Witt Associates and an eight-year FEMA veteran himself.  But the man who ran the flood program during the Katrina bailout, and who spent 25 years running his own insurance agency, said the solution should be obvious.  “The debt should have been forgiven five years ago. The debt was an obligation of the federal government. The program did exactly what it was designed to do,” said David Maurstad, who was administrator of the NFIP from 2004 to 2008.  Maurstad, who is now the national director of water policy and planning for infrastructure services company Atkins North America, said it made little sense for the government to bail out insurers like AIG during the financial crisis and yet leave its own insurance program with an unsustainable debt.  Yet neither chamber is even close to agreeing with the other, which means that sometime before September 30, Congress is likely to do what it has done annually in recent years — pass a one-year reauthorization for the NFIP that solves nothing but lets the program stay in business.  “Irene will highlight the need for renewal (of the NFIP), but it will not remove the obstacles to passage,” said Robert Gordon, senior vice president for policy at the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America.  The other complication is immediate cost. If NFIP does need more money, House Republicans quickly made clear those funds would have to be at the expense of something else.  “We’ll find other places to save so that we can fund this kind of role that the federal government needs to play,” House Majority Leader Eric Cantor told Fox News this week. “In instances like this, yes, there’s a federal role, yes, we can find the money. We’re just going to need to make sure there are savings elsewhere to continue to do so.”  People who were flooded have 30 days from the storm’s impact to file claims. When they get paid, though, will depend in large part on whether the NFIP accepts their claims or not.  (For answers on insurance coverage questions, see: ""Are you covered?"" - link.reuters.com/hag53s )  One of the problems that is likely to emerge in “Irene country” is one that people in Texas, Louisiana and Florida already know all too well — the legal conundrum of wind versus flood.  Simply put, in many cases an insurer will tell a homeowner their damage was caused by flood, and to call FEMA. In some cases, FEMA will tell the same homeowner that no, their damage was caused by wind, and instruct them to call the company that provides their homeowners’ insurance.  Enter the lawyers.  “There’s a big issue under homeowners’ insurance, and I would say maybe the most common issue, would be causation,” said Robert Berg, an insurance litigator and partner at Michelman & Robinson in San Francisco.  “It’s a problem with the legal process. If you have somebody at your house and they’re doing work, a contractor will say ‘It’s not my fault, it’s the other contractor’s fault.’ It’s the same thing.”  Berg and other attorneys say the legal issue of causation is, especially after Hurricane Katrina, fairly well defined in the more traditionally hurricane-prone parts of the country.  But in the northeast, where for some places a hurricane is a once-a-century event, the case law does not yet exist.  “Because there hasn’t been as much litigation in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast as there has been down south, it’s hard to say,” said Barry Buchman, an insurance litigator with Gilbert LLP in Washington.  Michelman & Robinson’s Berg said in a situation like this, the law may well be written on the fly.  “If it’s really horrific and you get enough attorneys involved, then they’ll think of ways to create coverage,” he said.  While politicians and lawyers battle over who pays, it’s the homeowners who suffer.  According to catastrophe modeling company Eqecat, Irene was an unusually wide, wet and slow storm, which made for ideal flooding conditions in parts of the northeast that had already experienced one of the wettest Augusts ever.  For people who live in New Jersey and suffered flooding damage earlier this year, having to suffer it again - and deal with insurance claims all over again - may be too much to handle.  Jonathan McNamara of Fairfield, New Jersey, said his parents just got their insurance checks a week ago for flooding from March, and now their home is flooded again.  “They have given us money but getting it is a whole other story,” said McNamara, 22, who lives with his parents. “It’s very time consuming and a very frustrating process.”  ",8312011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-irene-flood/special-report-irene-wallops-flood-insurance-program-idUSTRE77T5M620110831
57,ALL,Few insurers planning for climate change - report," * One in eight insurers have formal climate policy   * Study based on reports to state insurance bodies   * Ceres says insurers overly focused on hurricanes   By Ben Berkowitz   NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Only one in eight insurers has a formal policy in place to manage climate risk, despite rising evidence that environmental changes are exacerbating insurers’ disaster losses, according to a coalition of public interest groups.   The coalition, Ceres, looked at 88 filings from six states by insurance companies, using a form developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Ceres said it was the first-ever effort to quantify how U.S. insurers manage climate risk in their day-to-day operations.   Despite the broad lack of a formal policy, Ceres said insurers generally acknowledge the problem of climate change and the effect it can have on their business.   “Even those insurers with no formal climate policy, no climate risk management structure and a stated belief that the company is not vulnerable to the effects of climate change still name perils that may be affected by climate change 20 percent of the time,” Ceres said in its report.   Of the 11 companies with formal climate policies, two — Prudential Financial (PRU.N) and Genworth Financial (GNW.N) — are life insurers. The rest are mostly multi-line insurers or reinsurers. Among them are ACE Ltd ACE.N, AIG’s (AIG.N) Chartis unit.   (For an Insider interview with the author of the Ceres report, click here: link.reuters.com/myk53s)   The Ceres report comes as insurers start paying claims for last week’s Hurricane Irene, which broke flood records across the U.S. Northeast, and as they look to the Atlantic for the approach of what may become Hurricane Katia.   Because of the potential for hurricanes to cause sudden and huge losses in the United States, Ceres said the insurance industry is especially focused on how climate change will affect hurricane exposure, potentially at the expense of studying the impact on other common perils.   Some insurance companies have taken a public stand on climate issues, particularly home and auto insurer Allstate (ALL.N), which has warned that recent severe weather is part of a permanent change in the environment, and German reinsurance heavyweight Munich Re (MUVGn.DE).   Ceres recommended that all states make the National Association of Insurance Commissioners disclosure form mandatory and public, and that they adopt the model of California insurance regulators, who put together detailed guidelines on how to fill out the form.   Ceres describes itself is a national coalition of investors, environmental organizations and public interest groups.

58,ALL,COLUMN-Quinn Emanuel rides an MBS tsunami: Alison Frankel," -- Alison Frankel writes the On the Case blog for Thomson Reuters News & Insight (newsandinsight.com). The views expressed are her own. --   By Alison Frankel   NEW YORK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The Federal Housing Finance Agency’s reported mortgage-backed securities suits against a slew of major banks haven’t yet been filed. But if you want to know what they’re likely to look like, check out Mass Mutual’s 168-page MBS complaint against Bank of America (BAC.N), Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns, and JPMorgan (JPM.N), filed Thursday. (It’s so big the Massachusetts federal court docket splits it into four parts.) Or you could look at AIG’s (AIG.N) $10 billion megasuit against BofA, Countrywide, and Merrill, filed on Aug. 8, or Allstate’s (ALL.N) 114-page complaint against Goldman Sachs [GSGSC.UL] on Aug. 15, or U.S. Bank’s MBS breach-of-contract suit against BofA, which came at the beginning of this week.   All of those complaints — and many, many more raising allegations that big banks misrepresented the quality of the mortgages underlying the asset-backed securities they packaged and sold — were filed by the law firm representing FHFA in its MBS investigation: Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. And that’s no accident. Quinn Emanuel, a 450-lawyer firm whose partners take home an average of more than $3 million a year, made a conscious decision more than three years ago to push into structured finance litigation against money-center banks, at a time when most litigators didn’t know the first thing about these instruments. In a way, the anticipated FHFA suits are the culmination of Quinn Emanuel’s four-year investment in MBS litigation.   Before 2007, Quinn Emanuel was usually competing for a seat on the banks’ side of the table. Then name partner John Quinn, a onetime Cravath, Swaine & Moore lawyer, had a revolutionary thought. Quinn Emanuel doesn’t have a big corporate practice, he reasoned, so there were no conflicts to keep the firm from suing financial institutions. Rather than vie with a pack of premier law firms for bank business, he decided the firm should give up its relationships with banks and accounting firms and start representing corporate clients with claims against big banks. “We deduced there weren’t very many prestigious law firms willing to be adverse to financial institutions,” name partner William Urquhart told me Friday.    The firm’s New York office was perfectly positioned for the new practice area. Quinn Emanuel New York lawyers represented the trustee in the Parmalat bankruptcy, so they’d already had some experience litigating against banks. And litigators Peter Calamari and Philippe Selendy had at least a glancing knowledge of structured finance from cases they’d handled against UBS (UBS.N) and Bear Stearns. So when the housing bubble burst and mortgage-backed securities began to crater, Calamari, Selendy, and structured finance partner Jonathan Pickhardt hunkered down to learn all they could about the instruments — before Quinn Emanuel even had a single MBS client. “We invested an enormous amount of lawyer time to gain a deep, deep understanding of mortgage-backed securities,” Urquhart said.   “We had the expertise, and we had the horsepower,” added Calamari. “By the spring of 2008, it was apparent residential mortgage-backed securities were a disaster.”    The firm’s first MBS client was MBIA, the bond insurer. In October 2008, as the economic crisis worsened, Quinn Emanuel filed MBIA’s suit against Countrywide in New York state supreme court. That litigation produced some landmark MBS decisions from Judge Eileen Bransten, who refused to dismiss MBIA’s contract and fraud claims, ruled that MBIA can use statistical sampling to determine the percentage of deficient underlying mortgage loans, and granted the insurer access to discovery on the relationship between credit rating agencies and MBS issuers. Other businesses with MBS investments — including Mass Mutual, Allstate, and Assured Guaranty (AGO.N) — saw how the MBIA case was going and came to Quinn with their own claims. In October 2010 the FHFA disclosed that it had hired Quinn to analyze its potential MBS claims.   The work has already paid off big for Quinn Emanuel, even though MBS settlements are so far a rarity. (Two Quinn clients, Assured and the FHFA, have reached multibillion MBS settlements with BofA; the previous FHFA settlement involved mortgage loans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bought directly from Countrywide for their own securitizations; the expected new FHFA suit will center on mortgage-backed securities Fannie and Freddie invested in.) Unlike traditional plaintiffs firms, Quinn bills about 90 percent of its MBS cases at hourly rates, rather than on contingency. The volume of MBS litigation, in combination with the firm’s booming IP practice, has made Quinn Emanuel one of the three or four most profitable firms in the country.   Calamari told me that the MBS wave won’t last forever. New York has a six-year statute of limitations on fraud and contract claims; other states have narrower windows. The FHFA cases are reportedly being filed now to beat a three-year statute. “It’s clear that deadlines are coming,” Calamari said.   But the end is near only for new filings. When it comes to results of the MBS litigation, we’re just at the beginning.

59,ALL,Scenarios - Katia and Lee threaten insurance companies,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Lee is passing slowly over the Gulf Coast region of the southern United States, while Hurricane Katia is keeping forecasters guessing about where it will go and how fast it will get there.  Both could be disastrous to the insurance industry and the federal government, at a time when insurers are already dealing with the worst natural disaster year in history and the government is caught up in a fight over deficit cutting.  Following are best- and worst-case scenarios for both storms and the insurance industry.  Tropical Storm Lee is, from an insurance perspective, overwhelmingly a flooding event. That makes it the province of the National Flood Insurance Program, which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and which writes almost all of the homeowners flood insurance in this country.  The NFIP does not run a surplus, as a normal insurer does; rather, it operates with the goal of taking in enough premiums every year to cover its losses, with excess going to pay down the massive debt it had to take on after Hurricane Katrina.  While Lee has caused extensive flooding, there is evidence that the levee system protecting Louisiana communities has held, with only limited waters going over their tops.  New Orleans television station WWL reported the city was in many ways operating normally, with buses running and Armstrong International Airport open and operational.  That could ease fears that Lee would prove too much for the NFIP to handle, on top of the heavy claims the program is likely to receive from last weekend’s Hurricane Irene.  While New Orleans has held up relatively well from Lee, other parts of Louisiana are not doing as well.  WWL said Plaquemines Parish was working to bolster its last-resort flood protections as the water rose from Lee. NFIP data show the parish is one of the most heavily insured areas of the state, which itself is one of the most-insured parts of the country against flood.  If the parish is inundated, that would add to the flood program’s headaches. Beyond that one parish, though, the other problem is that Lee is far from being done dumping water on the southeastern part of the country.  “The primary threat from Lee will be extremely heavy rainfall over much of the southeastern U.S. during (the) next several days,” the National Hurricane Center said Sunday evening, adding that Lee appeared likely to remain a tropical storm for another 36 hours.  Catastrophe modeling company Eqecat said on Sunday that the storm’s slow progress was compounding the damage.  “Several smaller rivers in the region are at or approaching flood stage, and more regional flooding is expected as Lee progresses toward Tennessee during the next few days,” said the company, which provides software to insurers allowing them to model their exposure to disasters.  More flooding could push the NFIP to borrow in order to cover its claims, adding to a debt burden the Government Accountability Office has said it can never repay.  Even as Lee lingers, Hurricane Katia has an ongoing — and confounding — presence in the Atlantic.  The storm has wavered in and out of hurricane strength for days, and consistently not done what hurricane forecasters have expected it to do.  The latest iterations of their models are literally all over the map — some of the six NHC models put Katia in the Bahamas or the Carolinas in about a week, some suggest New Jersey or Massachusetts are at risk and some predict Katia will simply hook hard right and miss land entirely.  That last scenario is the best, in that it will let insurers off the hook for more losses. As of Friday afternoon, State Farm — the country’s largest home and auto insurer — had already received nearly 63,000 claims for Irene.  Other leading home and auto insurers like Allstate Corp, Chubb Corp and Travelers Companies Inc are already at risk of having third-quarter earnings wiped out by those kinds of claims, analysts have said.  As much as insurers might like to see Katia turn away, there is still that chance that the storm might make a U.S. landfall.  Global insurers and reinsurers have already suffered catastrophe losses of more than $70 billion this year, by industry estimates, including up to $6 billion in the United States from Irene.  Further hurricane losses would go further in wiping out third-quarter profits and make it harder for insurers to report an underwriting profit for the year.  “It’s more important to take a longer-term outlook because profitability doesn’t really exist on a quarter-by-quarter basis” with insurance, said Tom Lewandowski, an analyst at Edward Jones, in an interview earlier this week. “Inherently it’s a difficult, opaque type of item to think about but conservatism is the way I look at it.”  If Katia makes a turn toward U.S. land, it would also put pressure on insurers’ shares. Stocks fell in the week before Irene made landfall, only to rally in the week after as it became clear damage was less than expectations.

62,ALL,Senate advances bill for flood insurance,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Senate committee advanced a bill to approve billions of dollars in funding for national flood insurance just weeks before the troubled program is set to expire and as a series of storms swamps the country.  The bill would reform the National Flood Insurance Program, which insures millions of U.S. property owners, and keep it afloat for five years.  It must go to the full Senate for a vote and then be reconciled with the version the House of Representatives passed this summer.  It is unclear if that will happen before the program is due to expire on September 30, but members of the Senate Banking Committee were optimistic about the progress.  “We’ve worked hard on this. We’ve worked on it for years. It’s a complicated bill and I think we’re going in the right direction,” said Senator Richard Shelby, the most powerful Republican on the Banking Committee.  The bill would address premium increases, levy-building, business interruption insurance and floods in progress. Both Democrats and Republicans on the committee, though, described it as unfinished.  “We have agreement in principle. We couldn’t cross all of our T’s and dot all of the I’s last night,” said New York’s Charles Schumer, a Democrat.  The NFIP insures homeowners against flood damage and is virtually the only place to get protection against storms.  It is managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Policies are sold by dozens of private insurers, with premiums going to FEMA.  The NFIP had to be bailed out by taxpayers after it was swamped by claims from Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Now it is roughly $18 billion in debt and unable to pay the money back.  A series of abrupt program expirations and annual renewals have created uncertainty and roiled the market.  “I want a full-blown multi-year reauthorization. I don’t want to let up pressure on that at all,” said Senator David Vitter, a Republican from Louisiana.  “But I think it’s going to be clearly uphill to do that before September 30. I hope we all work together and make sure well ahead of September 30 we pass any necessary extension.”  While August’s Hurricane Irene was not as strong as Katrina, it caused severe and widespread flooding in some of America’s most populated — and most expensive — areas. As Vermont and other Northern states recover from Irene, Southern states are currently contending with Tropical Storm Lee and the country is bracing for a hit from approaching Hurricane Katia.

We’ve worked on it for years. It’s a complicated bill and I think we’re going in the right direction,” said Senator Richard Shelby, the most powerful Republican on the Banking Committee.    The bill would address premium increases, levy-building, business interruption insurance and floods in progress. Both Democrats and Republicans on the committee, though, described it as unfinished.   “We have agreement in principle. We couldn’t cross all of our T’s and dot all of the I’s last night,” said New York’s Charles Schumer, a Democrat.   The NFIP insures homeowners against flood damage and is virtually the only place to get protection against storms.   It is managed by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency. Policies are sold by dozens of private insurers, with premiums going to FEMA.   The NFIP had to be bailed out by taxpayers after it was swamped by claims from Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Now it is roughly $18 billion in debt and unable to pay the money back.   A series of abrupt program expirations and annual renewals have created uncertainty and roiled the market.   “I want a full-blown multi-year reauthorization. I don’t want to let up pressure on that at all,” said Senator David Vitter, a Republican from Louisiana.   “But I think it’s going to be clearly uphill to do that before September 30. I hope we all work together and make sure well ahead of September 30 we pass any necessary extension.”   While August’s Hurricane Irene was not as strong as Katrina, it caused severe and widespread flooding in some of America’s most populated — and most expensive — areas. As Vermont and other Northern states recover from Irene, Southern states are currently contending with Tropical Storm Lee and the country is bracing for a hit from approaching Hurricane Katia.

65,ALL,UPDATE 1-Allstate Irene losses less than tornado impact," * Lost $865 mln pretax in July/August, $500 mln from Irene   * Lost $2 bln in April/May from tornadoes   Sept 15 (Reuters) - Allstate Corp (ALL.N) lost $500 million on Hurricane Irene, the largest publicly traded home and auto insurer in the United States said on Thursday, much less than it lost from tornadoes earlier this year.   In total, Allstate said its July and August disaster losses came to $865 million before tax. The company did not break out the source of the other losses besides Irene.   In April and May, Allstate lost $2 billion because of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. That nearly equaled its disaster losses for all of 2010.   Industry estimates on the damage caused by Irene have varied widely, in part because most of Irene’s damage was from federally insured flooding and not privately insured wind effects. Some estimates suggest the total privately insured loss from the storm was less than $2 billion.   Allstate began releasing select monthly disaster data earlier this year after pressure from analysts, who wanted more clarity on the company’s catastrophe exposure.

66,ALL,Ipsos/Reuters poll: Irene water damage worse than wind,"   * Favorability ratings rise after Hurricane Irene   * Most have yet to file a claim   * Survey of just over 1,000 people Sept. 12-15   By Ben Berkowitz   Sept 22 (Reuters) - The number of people in the Northeastern United States who suffered water damage from Hurricane Irene is more than double the number who suffered wind damage, an Ipsos/Reuters poll showed on Thursday.   Yet two weeks after the storm struck, only 6 percent of Northeastern homeowners had contacted their insurance company regarding that damage, the poll found.   The nationwide survey of 1,009 adults was conducted Sept. 12-15. The results are considered accurate to within 3 percentage points.   Irene, the first hurricane to make landfall in the United States in three years, struck the mid-Atlantic region and the Northeast part of the country Aug. 27 and 28. Estimates of insured damage from the storm vary widely, from $1.8 billion all the way up to $7.1 billion.   Yet there is broad agreement that Irene was much more of a flooding event than many hurricanes, where wind damage is often the major factor.   The Ipsos/Reuters poll found 10 percent of homeowners in the Northeastern states had water damage, while only 4 percent had wind damage.   While wind damage is usually standard in homeowners insurance policies, residential flood insurance is almost exclusively the province of the federal government’s National Flood Insurance Program.   That split can sometimes lead to confusion and delay people in filing claims. Besides the 6 percent who said they had already contacted their insurer, another 6 percent said they had not and were not sure they even would.   Whether they filed claims or not, though, the Ipsos/Reuters poll found people in the region generally thought better of insurance companies after the storm.   Some 29 percent of respondents in the Northeast had a “very” or “mainly” favorable opinion of homeowners insurance companies, up from 22 percent who felt that way in a poll a month earlier. The favorability data comes from Ipsos’ monthly “I-Rep Insurance Advisor” survey.   Nationwide, though, that sentiment remained flat from one survey to the other.

67,ALL,Mortgages at risk if U.S. flood program expires,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The federal program that insures homes against flood damage expires next Friday and is at risk of not being renewed, even as an early fall storm threatens to inundate much of the northeastern United States yet again.  Industry executives say that if the National Flood Insurance Program lapses, it would become all but impossible to get a mortgage in flood zones across the country until the program is revived.  Insurers and lobbyists are due to meet Friday to strategize on getting an extension passed by next week, though there is little optimism something would happen in time.  The NFIP has 5.57 million policies in force nationwide, insuring $1.25 trillion in property, which would remain in place even if the program is not extended.  Yet the program is also struggling with an unsustainable debt load. A bill to reform the NFIP overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives this summer, but a competing reform bill has made little headway in the Senate.  In the meantime, the program has continued on a series of annual extensions, the last of which expires September 30. A short-term extension is part of the broader government funding bill the House passed early Friday, but Democrats have said the bill has no chance in the Senate.  “I would have thought surely we wouldn’t be going down this path again,” said Patty Templeton-Jones, vice president of operations and principal NFIP coordinator at Fidelity National Indemnity Insurance Co., which is the largest writer of flood insurance policies in the United States. The NFIP uses private insurance companies to write and administer policies on its behalf, paying them a fee for the service.  “This is absolutely getting ridiculous,” she said. “We are at this point preparing for a lapse.”  In certain designated flood areas, flood insurance is mandatory as a condition of mortgages and other loans. According to informal guidance issued by the Federal Reserve in early 2010, during a lapse period lenders can still make loans on properties that are required to have flood insurance, even if that insurance is not available.  But Templeton-Jones said that is almost certain not to happen, notwithstanding the Fed’s permission.  “They won’t take the risk at all,” she said. “There may be some small ones that may be willing to do that but the vast majority won’t put themselves at risk like that.”  The debate comes as the northeastern United States, which is just now drying out and starting to recover from Hurricane Irene last month, prepares to be slammed again.  The National Weather Service said Friday that areas from North Carolina to Massachusetts were at risk of flooding this weekend, and AccuWeather reported that the storm was already dropping more than 2 inches of rain an hour in spots.

Progressive sued Allstate, alleging that Allstate infringed some of its patents and trademarks for what it called “usage-based insurance.”   In a statement, Progressive said on Monday it licensed certain patent portfolios to Allstate, and that the two companies had entered into an agreement to let their various trademarks co-exist. Terms were not disclosed.   Allstate markets its program under the “DriveWise” label, while Progressive makes use of the “Drive” trademark.   Both insurers offer a device that policyholders can plug into their cars, which measures not only how much the customer drives but how fast they go, how often they brake hard and so on.   Both companies advertise the ability of customers to earn discounts of up to 30 percent on their premiums, depending how they drive.

72,ALL,Allstate toxic debt case vs Countrywide narrowed,"* Federal law claims tossed, state case can proceed * Bank of America had moved case to LA from New York By Jonathan Stempel Oct 24 (Reuters) - A judge threw out federal securities law claims in Allstate Corp’s fraud lawsuit against Bank of America Corp’s Countrywide unit over $700 million of toxic mortgage debt, but said the insurer may pursue state law claims. U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer in Los Angeles said Allstate waited too long to sue over the debt, which is not covered by other Countrywide residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) litigation she oversees. She nonetheless let the largest publicly traded U.S. home and auto insurer pursue state law claims accusing Countrywide of failing to tell investors that loans underlying its mortgage securities did not comply with its own underwriting standards. “Allstate has pleaded that the defendants misrepresented the value and riskiness of the underlying loans and the collateral securing those loans,” which it bought between 2005 and 2007, she wrote. “If true, the RMBS may have been worth less than Allstate paid for them.” Pfaelzer said Allstate could restate additional claims that it failed to argue properly. She also dismissed Bank of America itself as a defendant. Allstate spokeswoman Maryellen Thielen said the insurer is pleased that decision recognized that its claims are “amply supported by the law and the facts.” She said the insurer may amend the complaint or appeal the dismissal of various claims. Shirley Norton, a spokeswoman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, declined to comment. Pfaelzer oversees nationwide litigation over mortgage debt backed by loans from Countrywide, which was the largest U.S. mortgage lender before Bank of America bought it in July 2008. She has issued other rulings favorable to Bank of America, including last November when she cut the amount of securities at issue to $31 billion from $352 billion. Bank of America has sought to move other litigation over Countrywide debt to her court. This included the Allstate case, which a Manhattan federal judge sent to Pfaelzer in June. Other defendants in the Allstate case include former Countrywide Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo. He had sought to be dismissed from the case, saying he had nothing to do with the sale of debt to the Northbrook, Illinois-based insurer. Allstate has filed several lawsuits to recover losses on mortgage debt against lenders including Citigroup Inc , Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co . Shares of Allstate closed Monday up 17 cents at $27.07. The case is Allstate Insurance Co et al v.

Allstate also said it completed a $1 billion share buyback during the quarter. Chief Executive Tom Wilson said in an interview the company finished buying back shares ahead of schedule and that it will make a decision in the current quarter on whether to launch a new buyback. The company on Monday posted a profit of $165 million, or 32 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $367 million, or 68 cents per share. On an operating basis, excluding investment results, the company posted a profit of 16 cents per share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S on average expected earnings per share of 8 cents. Those analyst expectations had come down sharply in the last month as a result of the company’s disaster losses. According to Thomson Reuters data, the average earnings expectation a month ago was 25 cents a share. Allstate, which has been trying to improve its profitability by raising pricing, as well as reducing coverage in less-favorable markets such as New York and Florida, said policies in force fell in both auto and homeowners. Written auto premiums fell 0.8 percent, as higher prices were offset by fewer policies, while homeowners premiums rose 1.5 percent as stronger pricing was enough to offset the decline in policies. “I feel like we’re continuing to make progress.

Allstate, the largest publicly traded home and auto insurer in the country, posted a profit of $766 million or $1.53 per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $524 million or 98 cents per share. On an operating basis Allstate earned $1.42. Analysts on average expected earnings of $1.12 per share in the quarter. The company previously said it lost $260 million in the first quarter on natural disasters, less than some analysts had expected amid a relatively mild winter. Allstate said Wednesday it was also doing better in its long-suffering homeowners business, with higher premiums and stronger margins. Allstate shares rose 2.9 percent in after-hours trading on the news. Prudential, the second-largest life insurer in the United States, said it was hurt by charges for value changes in derivatives tied to the weakening of the Japanese yen. Prudential’s peer MetLife (MET.N) was also hurt in the first quarter by derivatives, though in its case on interest rates. Prudential reported a loss of $988 million, or $2.09 per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $539 million, or $1.10 per share. On an operating basis, the company earned $1.56. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S expected earnings of $1.71 per share. Prudential said it reached new record values for annuities, retirement accounts and assets under management in its asset management business. Operating income in U.S. individual life insurance rose as fewer people died, but the group life business swung to a loss on higher claims. Shares fell 4.5 percent in after-hours trading on the news. In addition to Prudential and Allstate, insurer Hartford Financial (HIG.N) reported results as well. The Hartford, which is in the middle of a breakup, earned $96 million, or 18 cents per share, in the quarter versus $501 million or 99 cents per share a year earlier. On an operating basis the company earned $1.25 per share. Analysts expected earnings of 91 cents per share. Amid pressure from its largest shareholder, hedge fund manager John Paulson, to take action and improve its industry-low valuation, the company said in March it would shut down its annuity business and sell off some of its life operations. Hartford said pricing rose in its commercial segment, mirroring gains made by competitors, but worsening trends in workers compensation dragged on results, as did the need to add to reserves for prior years in the commercial business.

Prudential reported a loss of $988 million, or $2.09 per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $539 million, or $1.10 per share. On an operating basis, the company earned $1.56. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S expected earnings of $1.71 per share. Prudential said it reached new record values for annuities, retirement accounts and assets under management in its asset management business. Operating income in U.S. individual life insurance rose as fewer people died, but the group life business swung to a loss on higher claims. Shares fell 4.5 percent in after-hours trading on the news. In addition to Prudential and Allstate, insurer Hartford Financial reported results as well. The Hartford, which is in the middle of a breakup, earned $96 million, or 18 cents per share, in the quarter versus $501 million or 99 cents per share a year earlier. On an operating basis the company earned $1.25 per share. Analysts expected earnings of 91 cents per share. Amid pressure from its largest shareholder, hedge fund manager John Paulson, to take action and improve its industry-low valuation, the company said in March it would shut down its annuity business and sell off some of its life operations. Hartford said pricing rose in its commercial segment, mirroring gains made by competitors, but worsening trends in workers compensation dragged on results, as did the need to add to reserves for prior years in the commercial business. Shares fell 1.1 percent in after-hours trading.",5022012,http://www.reuters.com/article/insurance/wrapup-1-allstate-beats-street-derivatives-hurt-prudential-idUSL1E8G16PN20120502

Allstate said the pre-tax loss came from 10 separate events, though it did not break them down or identify the largest among them. Still, the loss was much smaller than in April 2011, when Allstate and other insurers were hurt by a series of devastating tornadoes. The company lost $1.4 billion that month.

86,ALL,Sprint to offer auto insurers tracking technology,"* New unit to offer usage-based services * Allstate unit Esurance using Sprint platform * Dozens of insurers looking to enter market July 19 (Reuters) - U.S. wireless carrier Sprint said on Thursday it will move into the hot market for tracking technology that lets auto insurers monitor how, where and when their customers drive. Sprint said its new Integrated Insurance Solutions unit would let companies offer what are known as “usage-based insurance” programs. Such programs, most notably Progressive Corp’s  “Snapshot”, track variables such as driver speed, location and braking via a diagnostic device plugged into the car. Insurers analyze the data and use it to offer the best drivers discounts. Sprint said it would offer insurers a complete package — the tracking hardware, wireless services to transmit the data and access to the software needed to score driver behavior. Industry consultants say more than 30 North American insurers are looking at some sort of usage-based program, though barriers to entry can be high. By some estimates it can take carriers as long as five years to develop, conduct trials on and fully launch their own nationwide program. Progressive recently expanded its own program to non-customers, letting them try the hardware to see what kind of discount they might earn if they switched. Sprint said it had been working with Allstate unit Esurance on a pilot program in Arizona that was recently expanded into Texas.",7192012,http://www.reuters.com/article/insurance-sprint/sprint-to-offer-auto-insurers-tracking-technology-idUSL2E8IJ78A20120719

The largest publicly traded home and auto insurer in the United States raised its quarterly dividend to 25 cents per share from 22 cents and announced a $1 billion share buyback program. “In auto insurance, we expect to see relatively modest price increases, which are at or below the rate of inflation, across the industry,” Chief Executive Thomas Wilson told Reuters. Wilson was more optimistic about the home insurance business, where he expects prices to continue to rise throughout the industry. “Catastrophe losses are much higher in the last five years than they have been at almost any period in history and so those costs need to be passed on to customers.” The company recorded catastrophe losses of $1.06 billion for the fourth quarter, up from just $66 million in the year-ago period. Losses from Sandy were $1.12 billion. The company had to correct prior-period catastrophes it overestimated and the benefit of that went into the current quarter, Wilson said to explain why the total catastrophe losses were below the Sandy losses. Wilson said Allstate had 170,00 claims from Sandy and about 98 percent of them have been closed. Sandy, which struck the northeast United States on Oct. 29, is expected to be the second-costliest catastrophe in the country’s history, with insured loss estimates as high as $25 billion. The costliest catastrophe was Hurricane Katrina in 2005. For a factbox on initial Sandy-related loss estimates reported by insurers so far, click FOURTH-QUARTER PROFIT Allstate’s net income fell to $394 million, or 81 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31 from $712 million, or $1.40 per share, a year earlier. On an operating basis, it earned 59 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected Allstate, considered one of the most exposed companies to insured losses from Sandy, to post a loss of 5 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Underlying combined ratio, the percentage of premium revenue an insurer has to pay out in claims, was down 4 percentage points for the quarter to 86.7 percent. “Looks like it was core underwriting performance more than anything else ... core loss ratio came in well below what we expected,” Stifel Nicolaus analyst Meyer Shields said. The new $1 billion share repurchase program will be implemented in conjunction with another $1 billion program announced in December, which is to be funded with hybrid debt.

Allstate, the largest publicly traded home and auto insurer in the United States, raised its dividend to 25 cents per share from 22 cents. The new share repurchase program will be implemented in conjunction with another $1 billion program announced in December, which is to be funded with hybrid debt. Catastrophe losses for the fourth quarter were $1.06 billion, compared with $66 million in the year-earlier quarter, primarily due to the impact of superstorm Sandy. Sandy, which struck the northeast United States on October 29, is expected to be the second-costliest catastrophe in the country’s history, with insured loss estimates as high as $25 billion. The costliest catastrophe was Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Allstate’s net income fell to $394 million, or 81 cents per share, in the quarter ended December 31 from $712 million, or $1.40 per share, a year earlier.

108,ALL,Allstate says settled 95 percent Sandy claims; expects rate hikes,"(Reuters) - Allstate Corp’s (ALL.N) quarterly profit fell 45 percent on losses from superstorm Sandy, but the home and auto insurer said it has paid out about 95 percent of Sandy claims and is seeing rate increases across businesses. The largest publicly traded home and auto insurer in the United States raised its quarterly dividend to 25 cents per share from 22 cents and announced a $1 billion share buyback program. “In auto insurance, we expect to see relatively modest price increases, which are at or below the rate of inflation, across the industry,” Chief Executive Thomas Wilson told Reuters. Wilson was more optimistic about the home insurance business, where he expects prices to continue to rise throughout the industry. “Catastrophe losses are much higher in the last five years than they have been at almost any period in history and so those costs need to be passed on to customers.” The company recorded catastrophe losses of $1.06 billion for the fourth quarter, up from just $66 million in the year-ago period. Losses from Sandy were $1.12 billion. The company had to correct prior-period catastrophes it overestimated and the benefit of that went into the current quarter, Wilson said to explain why the total catastrophe losses were below the Sandy losses. Wilson said Allstate had 170,00 claims from Sandy and about 98 percent of them have been closed. Sandy, which struck the northeast United States on October 29, is expected to be the second-costliest catastrophe in the country’s history, with insured loss estimates as high as $25 billion. The costliest catastrophe was Hurricane Katrina in 2005. FOURTH-QUARTER PROFIT Allstate’s net income fell to $394 million, or 81 cents per share, in the quarter ended December 31 from $712 million, or $1.40 per share, a year earlier. On an operating basis, it earned 59 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected Allstate, considered one of the most exposed companies to insured losses from Sandy, to post a loss of 5 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Underlying combined ratio, the percentage of premium revenue an insurer has to pay out in claims, was down 4 percentage points for the quarter to 86.7 percent. “Looks like it was core underwriting performance more than anything else ... core loss ratio came in well below what we expected,” Stifel Nicolaus analyst Meyer Shields said. The new $1 billion share repurchase program will be implemented in conjunction with another $1 billion program announced in December, which is to be funded with hybrid debt. Allstate, with a market value of about $21.35 billion, is a Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX component.

109,ALL,Allstate returns to cat bond market with $250 million issue,"LONDON (Reuters) - Allstate, the largest publicly traded U.S. home and auto insurer, has returned to the catastrophe bond market with a $250 million offering, five years after investors lost millions of dollars on a previous issue due to the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The 2007 Willow Re bond - also for $250 million - was one of four so-called “cat bonds” that used Lehman Brothers as a swap counterparty, which meant it acted as a guarantor for the collateral backing the deal. When Lehman failed in 2008, the notes became invalid and investors did not get their original investment back. Insurers have used catastrophe bonds since the 1990s to manage their exposure to natural disasters by transferring potential losses to investment funds. Investors receive a high rate of interest on the bonds, but risk losing part or all of their capital if a natural disaster occurs. Allstate’s next bond - Willow Re 2008, issued before the 2007 transaction defaulted - matured in June 2011, and since then the insurer has had no coverage in the cat bond market. The new deal is called Sanders Re Ltd and has been given a BB+ and BB rating for its Class A and B notes respectively by credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s. The series 2013-1 class A notes are looking to raise at least $100 million from investors for coverage against hurricanes and earthquakes in the United States and the Class B notes are seeking to obtain $150 million. This time, Allstate has assigned the collateral for the deal into U.S. money market funds, which are rated ‘AAA’ by S&P; - the favoured way for issuers since the demise of Lehman Brothers exposed weaknesses in cat bond collateral structures.

The largest publicly traded home and auto insurer in the United States has been raising rates in its homeowners business at an average of 8 percent over the last two years to offset higher catastrophe losses. “We have got our pricing to the position where we are closer to where we want to be,” Chief Executive Thomas Wilson told Reuters.

114,ALL,Fitch Rates Allstate's Senior Debt 'BBB+'; Affirms Existing Ratings,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to  Allstate's issuance of senior notes. At the same time, Fitch affirmed the 'A-'  Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of The Allstate Corporation (Allstate) as well as  the 'A+' Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of Allstate Insurance Co. and  its property/casualty subsidiaries, and the 'A-' IFS ratings of Allstate Life  Insurance Co. and the other life subsidiaries (Allstate Financial). The Rating  Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release.  Allstate has also issued preferred stock, and Fitch expects to assign that  rating shortly. KEY RATING DRIVERS Key issues supporting the rating are Allstate's market position as a top tier  personal lines writer, good property/liability underwriting performance and  acceptable capitalization at the operating subsidiaries. Balanced against these  strengths is a history of material catastrophe losses and challenges associated  with undertaking a strategic shift in the life operations. Allstate announced a plan to retire approximately $3 billion in outstanding  senior debt and subordinated notes funded by a combination of preferred stock,  debt and cash. The company has $1.2 billion in debt maturing in 2013 and 2014  which will be included in the capital plan. Financial leverage ratios are likely  to improve depending in part on the amount of cash used.  The refinancing will  likely reduce interest expense given the prevailing low interest rate  environment. Debt-to-total capital remained appropriate for the current rating category at  27.3% at March 31, 2013, relative to Fitch's median guideline of 28%. This ratio  was calculated excluding unrealized investment gains on fixed income securities  from shareholders' equity. Allstate has the second leading market position in both private passenger auto  and homeowners insurance with an approximate market share of 10% measured by  premium written. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. remains the largest  with market share near 20%. Underwriting results for Allstate's property/liability business were favorable  with a GAAP combined ratio of 93.2% for the first quarter of 2013 relative to  92.1% for the comparable period in 2012. Personal auto accounts for  approximately 70% of property/liability written premiums and reported a combined  ratio of 95.7% for the first quarter of 2013, improving from 97.1% in the  comparable period of 2012.  Approximately one-fifth of Allstate's property/liability written premium comes  from the homeowners line of business. Underwriting results for the homeowners  line continue to be positive, reporting a combined ratio of 85.6% for the first  quarter of 2013. Greater catastrophe losses in the first quarter of 2013 explain  the modest deterioration in the homeowners' combined ratio from 80.5% in the  first quarter of 2012. Allstate's 10-year average annual catastrophe loss remains high at 9.7% of  earned premiums. Losses attributable to catastrophes in 2012 were slightly below  the 10-year average at 8.8% of earned premiums, while 2011 was a particularly  challenging year with catastrophe losses amounting to 14.7% of earned premiums. Statutory surplus at Allstate Insurance Company (AIC), the primary  property/casualty underwriting subsidiary, was $17.2 billion as of March 31,  2013. While this level of capitalization is acceptable at the current rating  category, it remains below pre-financial crisis levels of $19.1 billion reported  at year-end 2006. Operating leverage, excluding $3.6 billion in surplus  attributable to Allstate's life operations, was nearly 2.0x, which is considered  consistent with the 1.8x median guideline for 'A' rated companies in Fitch's  universe.  Allstate Financial reported net income of $146 million for the first three  months of 2013, up from $112 million in the same period of 2012. Modest  investment gains in 2013 relative to losses in 2012 were responsible for the  period-to-period change. This result continues to represent an improvement  relative to material net losses during the financial crisis.  The rating on Allstate's life operations reflects Fitch's assessment of its  limited strategic importance within the Allstate enterprise and view that the  'standalone' IFS rating is in the 'BBB' range. The ratings of the life  operations continue to benefit from the Capital Support Agreement from Allstate  Insurance Co. and its access to the holding company credit facility.  The life operations focus on traditional underwritten products and de-emphasize  spread-based products, which improve its risk profile. Increased earnings at  Allstate Financial could eventually improve its strategic importance within the  Allstate enterprise, but Fitch believes it will take time for a significant  increase in earnings to occur. Fitch's rating rationale anticipates a continuation of Allstate's practice of  maintaining sizeable liquid assets at the holding company level. Allstate has  $2.2 billion in holding company assets that could be liquidated within three  months, relative to forecasted annual interest expense and common dividends of  approximately $900 million. Further, holding company resources are sufficient to  meet the July 2013 maturity of $250 million of senior notes. RATING SENSITIVITIES  Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to an upgrade include:  --Growth in surplus leading to an improved capitalization profile measured by  operating leverage approaching 1.1x and a score of 'Strong' or better on Fitch's  proprietary capital model, Prism; --Reduced volatility in earnings from catastrophe losses and better operating  results consistent with companies in the 'AA' rating category; --Standalone ratings for Allstate's life subsidiaries could increase if their  consolidated statutory Risky Assets/TAC ratio falls below 100% and they are able  to sustain a GAAP based Return on Assets ratio over 80 basis points.  Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to a downgrade include:  --A prolonged decline in underwriting profitability that is inconsistent with  industry averages or is driven by an effort to grow market share during soft  pricing conditions; --Substantial adverse reserve development that is inconsistent with industry  trends;  --Significant deterioration in capital strength as measured by Fitch's capital  model, NAIC risk-based capital and traditional operating leverage. Specifically,  if operating leverage, excluding the surplus of the life insurance operations,  approached 2.5x it would place downward pressure on ratings; --Significant increases in financial leverage ratio to greater than 30%; --Unexpected and adverse surrender activity on liabilities in the life insurance  operations; --Liquid assets at the holding company less than one year's interest expense and  common dividends. Fitch has assigned the following ratings: --3.15% $500 million senior notes 'BBB+';  --4.50% $500 million senior notes 'BBB+'. Fitch affirms the following ratings for Allstate and subsidiaries:  The Allstate Corporation --Long-term IDR at 'A-'.

115,ALL,Tebow gets a chance with Patriots,"(Reuters) - Tim Tebow was handed another chance in the National Football League on Tuesday when the New England Patriots signed the quarterback to an undisclosed deal. The Patriots did not reveal the terms of the contract but it was expected Tebow would be the team’s third-choice passer, behind starting quarterback Tom Brady and his back-up Ryan Mallett. Media reports suggested Tebow had signed a two year contract with no guaranteed payments, making the move risk-free for New England. A polarizing figure, Tebow’s brief NFL career appeared to be in jeopardy after he was traded by the Denver Broncos then released by the New York Jets in April. “Anything we do is what we feel is in the best interest of the team,” said Patriots head coach Bill Belichick. “Tim is a talented player that’s smart and works hard, so we’ll see how it goes,” added Belichick who gave short shrift to follow up questions on the player. By joining the Patriots, Tebow, 25, will reunite with his former coach Josh McDaniels, the offensive coordinator at New England. McDaniels had been head coach at the Broncos when Tebow, a former College football star who won the Heisman Trophy in 2007, was drafted as a first-round pick from the University of Florida. When he finally got his start in the NFL, Tebow took the Broncos on an improbable run to the 2011 playoffs, beating the Pittsburgh Steelers before losing to the Patriots, despite criticism and reservations about his ability as a passer. He also quickly become a household name, with his popularity going well beyond the NFL. Deeply religious and with a clean-cut image, he became a magnet for sponsors, signing a range of massive endorsement deals which earned him an estimated $4 million a year. Tebow’s jerseys were among the biggest sellers in the NFL and his habit of going down on one knee in prayer, became known as “Tebowing.” In early 2012, the Broncos signed future Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning after he had become a free agent, and traded Tebow to the Jets. The Jets said they planned to use Tebow on their special teams and ‘wildcat’ plays, but the experiment was rarely tried and he spent most of each game stuck on the bench with the Jets eventually releasing him after missing the playoffs. The Patriots and the Jets face each other twice each season in the AFC East division. Critics of Tebow as a player have questioned whether he will ever have the passing accuracy needed to make it in the pro game but he has worked intensely on his technique during the off-season at IMG’s academy in Bradenton, Florida. Chris Weinke, who was Tebow’s passing tutor during those sessions says the quarterback is a much improved player. “I made an adjustment to his lower half and invariably that’s where the quickness came from,” Weinke, a former NFL quarterback, told USA Today. “What I saw was, when his feet were in good position, he was throwing the ball with great accuracy, great velocity. And the ball was coming out much quicker. “He’s proven he can win at that position. He has had great success. He does things the right way and has a guy in Tom who is one of the elite quarterbacks to ever play the game that he’ll be able to spend time with every day. “The things we worked on down here are going to pay dividends in New England.” ",6112013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nfl-patriots-tebow/tebow-gets-a-chance-with-patriots-idUSBRE95A0Q220130611
116,ALL,Fitch Rates Allstate's Preferred Stock 'BB+',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO/NEW YORK, June 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BB+' rating to  Allstate's issuance of preferred stock.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Allstate's recent issuance of $250 million of 5.625% fixed rate perpetual  non-cumulative preferred stock is part of an announced  plan to retire  approximately $3 billion in outstanding senior debt and subordinated notes  funded by a combination of preferred stock, debt and cash. The company has $1.2  billion in debt maturing in 2013 and 2014 which will be included in the capital  plan.  Based on its rating criteria, Fitch has assigned 100% equity credit to the  preferred stock and has added an additional notch to the rating to reflect more  aggressive loss absorption features.  The security has no stated maturity. Dividends are non-cumulative, and the  company has the option to defer them at their discretion. In addition, the  security has a mandatory deferral feature that requires deferral if certain  capital ratios or operating results are breached. Fitch believes the mandatory  deferral could be triggered before there is significant stress in the  organization. Therefore, it deems the features as having more aggressive loss  absorption.  Debt-to-total capital remained appropriate for the current rating category at  27.3% at March 31, 2013, relative to Fitch's median guideline of 28%. This ratio  was calculated excluding unrealized investment gains on fixed income securities  from shareholders' equity.  On June 7, 2013, Fitch affirmed all of Allstate's ratings with a Stable Outlook.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to an upgrade include:  --Growth in surplus leading to an improved capitalization profile measured by  operating leverage approaching 1.1x and a score of 'Strong' or better on Fitch's  proprietary capital model, Prism; --Reduced volatility in earnings from catastrophe losses and better operating  results consistent with companies in the 'AA' rating category; --Standalone ratings for Allstate's life subsidiaries could increase if their  consolidated statutory Risky Assets/TAC ratio falls below 100% and they are able  to sustain a GAAP based Return on Assets ratio over 80 basis points.  Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to a downgrade include:  --A prolonged decline in underwriting profitability that is inconsistent with  industry averages or is driven by an effort to grow market share during soft  pricing conditions; --Substantial adverse reserve development that is inconsistent with industry  trends;  --Significant deterioration in capital strength as measured by Fitch's capital  model, NAIC risk-based capital and traditional operating leverage. Specifically,  if operating leverage, excluding the surplus of the life insurance operations,  approached 2.5x it would place downward pressure on ratings; --Significant increases in financial leverage ratio to greater than 30%; --Unexpected and adverse surrender activity on liabilities in the life insurance  operations; --Liquid assets at the holding company less than one year's interest expense and  common dividends. Fitch has assigned the following rating to Allstate: --5.625% preferred stock 'BB+'.  Contact:  Primary Analyst  Douglas M.

Flowers are bidding for Allstate Corp’s (ALL.N) Lincoln Benefit Life subsidiary, according to two people familiar with the situation. TPG and J.C. Flowers have teamed up to bid for the insurance subsidiary, which could be valued at $500 million to $900 million, said one of the people familiar with the situation, who is not permitted to speak to media and wished to remain anonymous. Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is handling the sale of the business, the people said. Allstate, Goldman, Resolution and TPG declined to comment. J.C. Flowers was not immediately available for comment. A growing number of insurers have been selling their life and annuity businesses because the low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to run these businesses profitably. In April, AXA SA AXA.PA sold its U.S. life insurance unit to Protective Life Corp PL.N for $1.06 billion. In December, Sun Life Financial Inc sold its variable annuity business to Delaware Life Holdings, a company owned by clients and shareholders of Guggenheim Partners. The Sun Life unit was valued at $1.35 billion. Resolution Life and J.C. Flowers had also bid for the Sun Life unit but lost to Delaware, sources had told Reuters at the time <ID: nL1E8MF4XC>.

The deal is the latest example of an insurer selling a life and annuity business in the low interest-rate environment. It follows AXA SA’s sale of its U.S. life insurance unit to Protective Life Corp in April and Sun Life Financial Inc’s sale of its variable annuity business to Delaware Life Holdings in December..

Chief Executive Thomas Wilson said the sale, which represents only a portion of Allstate’s life insurance business, would reduce the company’s exposure to spread-based business and interest rates.

133,ALL,"UPDATE 2-Allstate tops profit estimates, says rates close to sustainable","* 2nd-quarter oper earnings/share $1.12 vs est. $0.98 * Natural disaster losses down 21 percent By Neha Dimri and Aman Shah July 31 (Reuters) - Home and auto insurer Allstate Corp’s  quarterly profit handily beat analysts’ estimates, and the company said it had raised prices close to a sustainable level in the last two years. The largest publicly traded home and auto insurer in the United States has been raising rates in its homeowners business at an average of 8 percent over the last two years to offset higher disaster losses. “There are certain locations where we’re still raising prices where there are high catastrophes, but we’re a lot closer to pricing sufficiency than we were even a year ago,” Chief Executive Thomas Wilson told Reuters. Losses from natural disasters such as tornados, hurricanes and floods fell 21 percent to $647 million in the second quarter. Insurers find it difficult to forecast these losses due to their unexpected nature. “I still don’t consider the overall (catastrophe) level quiet ... it’s still relatively high as opposed to what it was four or five years ago,” Wilson said. Peer Travelers Cos Inc said last week it would cut jobs and reduce prices of auto insurance to battle increasing competition. Wilson had said last quarter that he expected modest price increases in the auto insurance business. “In terms of comparison between Travelers’ comments and its impact on Allstate, the distribution channel is a bit different between the two so I am not sure one can draw a parallel,” Macquarie Research analyst Amit Kumar said in a note to Reuters. Allstate’s net income rose 3 percent to $434 million, or 92 cents per share, from $423 million, or 86 cents per share, a year earlier. The rise in profit was helped by strong premium growth across the company’s businesses. Premiums earned rose 3 percent to $6.86 billion, while underwriting income doubled to $269 million. On an operating basis, Allstate reported earnings of $1.12 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 98 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said earlier this month it would sell one of its life insurance businesses, Lincoln Benefit Life Co, for $600 million as it looks to reduce its exposure to low interest rates in the sector. Allstate shares, which last week touched their highest in more than five years, were marginally up at $51.15 in post-market trading, after closing at $50.98 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.",7312013,http://www.reuters.com/article/allstate-results/update-2-allstate-tops-profit-estimates-says-rates-close-to-sustainable-idUSL4N0G152020130731
134,ALL,"Allstate profit beats, says under no pressure to hike rates","(Reuters) - Allstate Corp (ALL.N), the largest publicly traded home and auto insurer in the United States, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly operating profit as fewer natural disasters helped it earn more premiums. The company, which has been aggressively raising rates in its homeowners businesses to offset higher catastrophe losses and low interest rates on its investments, said on Wednesday it did not see the need for dramatic rate hikes. “We don’t have a lot of need to raise our prices dramatically from here, assuming the weather remains the same,” Chief Executive Thomas Wilson told Reuters. Losses from natural disasters such as tornados, hurricanes and floods fell 37 percent to $128 million in the third quarter. Insurers find it difficult to forecast these losses due to their unexpected nature. Wilson said that the company had raised premium rates at an average of about 4.5 percent over the last four months in the homeowners business, lower than levels in the past few years. The company was also able to write more premiums in its auto insurance division, in which it faces increasing competition. Allstate brand standard auto policies in force rose over both the prior year quarter and the last quarter, the company said in an earnings presentation. “Investors will appreciate the continued sequential improvement in Allstate brand policies in force,” Macquarie Equities Research analyst Amit Kumar said in an email. Wilson said he expected price increases in the auto insurance division to be ‘relatively benign’ as declining frequency in claims linked to safer cars and drivers would not pressure the prices to go higher. Allstate’s net income fell 57 percent to $310 million, or 66 cents per share, in the third quarter as it took an estimated $475 million after-tax loss on the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life Co. The company said in July it would sell the business to Resolution Life Holdings for $600 million. Allstate will be able to free up about $1 billion in capital after the sale, which is expected to close around the end of this year or in the beginning of next year, CEO Wilson said. On an operating basis, Allstate reported earnings of $1.53 cents per share, easily surpassing the average analyst estimate of $1.39 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total property-liability insurance premiums rose 4 percent to $6.97 billion. The Allstate brand homeowners business recorded a combined ratio of 65.3, a 7.6 point improvement, boosted by rate increases and a decline in disasters. An insurer’s combined ratio is the percentage of premium revenue the company has to pay out in claims. A ratio of under 100 indicates an underwriting profit. The company’s shares, which have gained about a third of their value this year, closed at $52.96 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

137,ALL,Fitch Affirms Allstate's Ratings; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO/NEW YORK, December 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BB+' rating  to Allstate's issuance of preferred stock. At the same time, Fitch affirmed the  'A-' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of The Allstate Corporation (Allstate) as well  as the 'A+' Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of Allstate Insurance Co.  and its property/casualty subsidiaries, and the 'A-' IFS ratings of Allstate  Life Insurance Co. and the other life subsidiaries (Allstate Financial). The  Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this  release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Allstate's market position as a top tier personal lines writer, good  property/liability underwriting performance and progress on the restructuring of  the life insurance operations all support the current ratings. Favorably,  capitalization at the operating subsidiaries improved modestly and Allstate's  recapitalization during 2013 incrementally lowered financial leverage. Balanced  against these strengths are elevated levels of risky assets at the life  operation and challenges associated with undertaking a strategic shift in the  life operations. In December, Allstate will issue $135 million of 6.625% fixed rate perpetual  non-cumulative preferred stock as part of its recapitalization plan. Proceeds  from the issuance will go toward general corporate purposes. Based on its rating  criteria, Fitch has assigned 100% equity credit to the preferred stock and has  added one notch to the rating relative to standard notching to reflect more  aggressive loss absorption features.  Similar to previously issued preferred stock, the security has no stated  maturity, dividends are non-cumulative, and the company has the option to defer  them at their discretion. In addition, the security has a mandatory deferral  feature that requires deferral if certain capital ratios or operating results  are breached. Fitch believes the mandatory deferral could be triggered before  there is significant stress in the organization. Therefore, it deems the  features as having more aggressive loss absorption. Pro forma financial leverage ratio as of Sept. 30, 2013 was 23.6% and remained  appropriate for the current rating category relative to Fitch's median guideline  of 28%. This ratio reflects the equity credit assigned to the new and existing  preferred stock as well as excludes unrealized investment gains on fixed income  securities from shareholders' equity. Allstate has the second leading market position in both private passenger auto  and homeowners insurance with an approximate market share of 10% measured by  premium written. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. remains the largest  with market share near 20%. Underwriting results for Allstate's property/liability business were favorable  with a GAAP combined ratio of 93.1% for the first nine months of 2013 relative  to 95.5% for the full year 2012. Fitch believes this ratio may deteriorate  somewhat in the fourth quarter due to Midwest storm losses. Personal standard  auto accounts for approximately two-thirds of property/liability written  premiums and reported a combined ratio of 96.6% for the first nine months of  2013, which was relatively steady from the comparable period in 2012.  Nearly one-quarter of Allstate's property/liability written premium comes from  the homeowners line of business. Underwriting results for the homeowners line  continue to be positive, reporting a combined ratio of 82.4% for the first nine  months of 2013. A relatively benign catastrophe year through the first nine  months and favorable pricing 2013 explain the improvement in the homeowners'  combined ratio from 86.3% in the comparable period in 2012. Allstate's year-to-date catastrophe losses were 5.5% of earned premiums, which  was well below the company's 10-year average annual catastrophe loss of 9.7% of  earned premiums.  Combined statutory surplus at Allstate's P/C operations was $17.1 billion at  Sept. 30, 2013. Surplus continues to grow at a modest pace but remains below  pre-financial crisis levels of $19.1 billion reported at year-end 2006. Net  leverage excluding life company capital was 4.0x, which is somewhat better than  the guideline for the current rating category. Allstate's score on Fitch's  proprietary capital model, Prism, was 'Strong' which represents an improvement  from 'Adequate' and coincides with the current rating category. Allstate Financial reported a modest net loss of $24 million for the first nine  months of 2013, down from $541 million of net income for the full year 2012. A  $644 million loss on the disposition of Lincoln Benefit Life (LBL), which  remains on Rating Watch Negative pending close of the sale transaction, was  primarily responsible for the change.  Allstate's life insurance operations reported risky assets of 163% of total  adjusted capital as of Sept. 30, 2013 compared to Fitch's median guideline of  130% for the 'BBB' category. Below investment grade bonds and Schedule BA and  'Other' assets were responsible for the elevated ratio. Gross unrealized losses  have improved significantly over the last couple years and no longer represent a  material concern. The rating on Allstate's life operations reflects Fitch's assessment of its  limited strategic importance within the Allstate enterprise and view that the  'standalone' IFS rating is in the 'BBB' category. The ratings of the life  operations continue to benefit from the Capital Support Agreement from Allstate  Insurance Co. and its access to the holding company credit facility.  The life operations focus on traditional underwritten products and de-emphasize  spread-based products, which improve its risk profile. Increased earnings at  Allstate Financial could eventually improve its strategic importance within the  Allstate enterprise, but Fitch believes it will take time for a significant  increase in earnings to occur. Fitch's rating rationale anticipates a continuation of Allstate's practice of  maintaining liquid assets at the holding company level to fund at least one year  of interest expense, preferred dividends and common dividends as well as  upcoming debt maturities. Allstate had $2.8 billion in holding company assets at  Sept. 30, 2013 that could be liquidated within three months, relative to  forecasted annual interest expense, preferred and common dividends of  approximately $860 million and 2014 debt maturities of $1 billion.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to an upgrade include:  --Sustainable capital position measured by net leverage excluding life company  capital below 3.8x and a score approaching 'Very Strong' on Fitch's proprietary  capital model, Prism; --Reduced volatility in earnings from catastrophe losses and better operating  results consistent with companies in the 'AA' rating category; --Standalone ratings for Allstate's life subsidiaries could increase if their  consolidated statutory Risky Assets/TAC ratio approaching 100% and they are able  to sustain a GAAP based Return on Assets ratio over 80 basis points.  Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to a downgrade include:  --A prolonged decline in underwriting profitability that is inconsistent with  industry averages or is driven by an effort to grow market share during soft  pricing conditions; --Substantial adverse reserve development that is inconsistent with industry  trends;  --Significant deterioration in capital strength as measured by Fitch's capital  model, NAIC risk-based capital and statutory net leverage. Specifically, if net  leverage excluding life company capital approached 4.8x it would place downward  pressure on ratings; --Significant increases in financial leverage ratio to greater than 30%; --Unexpected and adverse surrender activity on liabilities in the life insurance  operations; --Liquid assets at the holding company less than one year's interest expense and  common dividends.

142,ALL,Allstate eyes bigger share of insurance markets in 2014,"(Reuters) - Allstate Corp (ALL.N) aims to grow its share of the U.S. home and auto insurance markets without the need for “abnormally large” rate increases, its CEO said, after the company’s profit more than doubled in the fourth quarter. Shares of Allstate, the largest publicly traded home and auto insurer in the United States, rose 2 percent after the bell on Wednesday. The company, which posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit, has increased insurance premiums aggressively in the last few years without any significant loss to its share of the highly competitive home and auto insurance markets. This has allowed Allstate to compensate for uncertain catastrophe losses and low interest rates on its investments. Catastrophe losses fell sharply in the fourth quarter ended December 31. This, along with higher premiums across all of its businesses, helped Allstate to race past Wall Street estimates for the period. With premiums already high after a series of “dramatic” price increases, Allstate would focus this year on attracting customers to boost its market share, Chief Executive Thomas Wilson told Reuters. “We do not expect to have to be taking abnormally large price increases in the homeowners business,” he said. In the fourth quarter, Allstate’s home insurance business benefited from the decline in catastrophe losses to record a combined ratio of 66.6 - an improvement of 27.3 points over the corresponding year-earlier quarter. An insurer’s combined ratio is the percentage of premium revenue that the company must pay out in claims. The fourth quarter of 2012 included $1.12 billion in losses from superstorm Sandy. Losses from natural disasters fell almost 90 percent to $117 million for the fourth quarter of 2013. Wilson said Allstate planned to maintain its underlying combined ratio in the homeowners business in the low 60s. In the auto business, Allstate’s existing policies rose versus both the previous quarter and the year-earlier quarter for the second reporting period in succession. Allstate’s share of the U.S. auto insurance market in 2012 was about 10 percent, only slightly lower than it was in 2011, according to data from regulatory body the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Wilson said the company, flush with about $1 billion in excess capital from the sale of its Lincoln Benefit Life unit last year, would look to return capital to shareholders and fund growth. He said the board would decide in the next two months how to deploy this cash. Share buybacks and dividend payouts were among the options being considered, he said. Allstate posted fourth-quarter net income of $810 million, or $1.76 per share. On an operating basis, the company earned $1.70 per share, easily beating the average analyst estimate of $1.38 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of the company, which have fallen more than 8 percent this year, closed at $49.55 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

143,ALL,Fitch Rates Allstate's $650MM Preferred Stock 'BB+',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BB+' rating to  Allstate's issuance of preferred stock.  Fitch currently rates Allstate's IDRs 'A-/ F1' with a Stable Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS  Allstate's planned issuance of $650 million of 6.625% fixed rate perpetual  non-cumulative preferred stock (an amount excluding a possible additional 15%  overallotment) is for general corporate purposes.  Based on its rating criteria, Fitch has assigned 100% equity credit to the  preferred stock and has added an additional notch to the rating to reflect more  aggressive loss absorption features.  The security has no stated maturity. Dividends are non-cumulative and Allstate  has the option to defer them at their discretion. In addition, the security has  a mandatory deferral feature that requires deferral if certain capital ratios or  operating results are breached. Fitch believes the mandatory deferral could be  triggered before there is significant stress in the organization. Therefore, it  deems the features as having more aggressive loss absorption.  Debt-to-total capital remained appropriate for the current rating category at  23.4% at Dec. 31, 2013 (22.8% proforma for the preferred stock issue), relative  to Fitch's median guideline of 28%. This ratio was calculated excluding  unrealized investment gains on fixed income securities from shareholders'  equity.  Fitch calculated the run-rate fixed charge coverage to be between 9-11 times  based on $3.8 billion in GAAP EBIT for 2013. GAAP EBIT was divided by annual  interest expense on the debt and pre-tax preferred dividends, totaling  approximately $440 million (including dividends from the new stock issue).  Fitch's median guideline for the rating category is 7.0x.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to an upgrade include:  --Growth in surplus leading to an improved capitalization profile measured by  operating leverage approaching 1.1x and a score of 'Strong' or better on Fitch's  proprietary capital model, Prism; --Reduced volatility in earnings from catastrophe losses and better operating  results consistent with companies in the 'AA' rating category; --Standalone ratings for Allstate's life subsidiaries could increase if their  consolidated statutory Risky Assets/TAC ratio falls below 100% and they are able  to sustain a GAAP based Return on Assets ratio over 80 basis points.  Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to a downgrade include:  --A prolonged decline in underwriting profitability that is inconsistent with  industry averages or is driven by an effort to grow market share during soft  pricing conditions; --Substantial adverse reserve development that is inconsistent with industry  trends;  --Significant deterioration in capital strength as measured by Fitch's capital  model, NAIC risk-based capital and traditional operating leverage. Specifically,  if operating leverage, excluding the surplus of the life insurance operations,  approached 2.5x it would place downward pressure on ratings; --Significant increases in financial leverage ratio to greater than 30%; --Unexpected and adverse surrender activity on liabilities in the life insurance  operations; --Liquid assets at the holding company less than one year's interest expense and  common dividends.

149,ALL,Fitch Rates Allstate's $250MM Preferred Stock 'BB+'; Affirms Ratings,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 17 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BB+' rating to Allstate's  issuance of preferred stock. At the same time, Fitch affirmed the 'A-' Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) of The Allstate Corporation (Allstate) as well as the 'A+'  Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of Allstate Insurance Co. and its  property/casualty subsidiaries, and the 'A-' IFS ratings of Allstate Life  Insurance Co. and the other life subsidiaries (Allstate Financial). The Rating  Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Allstate issued $250 million of 6.25% fixed-rate perpetual non-cumulative  preferred stock and proceeds from the issuance will go toward general corporate  purposes.  Based on its rating criteria, Fitch has assigned 100% equity credit  to the preferred stock and has added an additional notch to the rating to  reflect more aggressive loss absorption features.  Similar to previously issued preferred stock, the security has no stated  maturity, dividends are non-cumulative, and the company has the option to defer  them at its discretion.  In addition, the security has a mandatory deferral  feature that requires deferral if certain capital ratios or operating results  are breached. Fitch believes the mandatory deferral could be triggered before  there is significant stress noted in the organization.  Therefore, it deems the  features as having more aggressive loss absorption. After the $250 million preferred stock issuance and maturity of $300 million in  senior notes, pro forma financial leverage ratio as of March 31, 2014 was 22%.   Financial leverage remained appropriate for the current rating category relative  to Fitch's median guideline of 28%. This ratio reflects the equity credit  assigned to the new and existing preferred stock as well as excluding unrealized  investment gains on fixed income securities from shareholders' equity. Earnings before interest expense and taxes covered interest expense and  preferred dividends by 8.8x during the first quarter of 2014 (1Q'14).  This  level of fixed charge coverage is consistent with Fitch's median guideline of 7x  for the current rating category.  Fixed charge coverage has been relatively  steady, reporting a ratio of 8.3x for the full year 2013. Underwriting results for Allstate's property/liability business deteriorated  modestly but remained solid with a GAAP combined ratio of 94.7% for 1Q'14  relative to 92.0% for the full year 2013. Catastrophe losses accounted for 6.3  percentage points on 1Q'14 combined ratio compared to 4.5 points on 2013's  ratio.  Fitch believes this ratio may deteriorate somewhat in the second quarter  as Allstate announced April catastrophe losses of $280 million from six events  plus some adverse reserve development on prior-period catastrophe losses.   Personal auto accounts for two-thirds of property/liability written premiums and  reported a combined ratio of 96.1% for the first three months of 2014, which was  relatively steady from 95.7% in the comparable period of 2013.  Nearly one-quarter of Allstate's property/liability written premium comes from  the homeowners line of business. Underwriting results for the homeowners line  continue to be positive, reporting a combined ratio of 88.4% for the first three  months of 2014. Catastrophe losses through the first quarter were responsible  for modest deterioration in the homeowners combined ratio from 85.6% in the  comparable period in 2013. Combined statutory surplus at Allstate's P/C operations was $18 billion at  year-end 2013. Surplus continues to grow at a modest pace, but remains below  pre-financial crisis levels of $19.1 billion reported at year-end 2006. Stated  net leverage was 3.1x at year-end 2013 and approximately 3.6x excluding life  company capital.   Allstate Financial reported a net income of $162 million for the first three  months of 2014, up modestly from $146 million for the comparable period in 2013.  Allstate Financial's annualized pre-tax operating return on assets was 0.8% for  1Q'14.  Risky assets ratio remains elevated at 178% of total adjusted capital at  year-end 2013. The rating on Allstate's life operations reflects Fitch's assessment of its  limited strategic importance within the Allstate enterprise and view that the  'standalone' IFS rating is in the 'BBB' category. Ratings of the life operations  continue to benefit from the Capital Support Agreement from Allstate Insurance  Co. and its access to the holding company credit facility. The life operations  focus on traditional underwritten products and de-emphasize spread-based  products, which improves its risk profile. Increased earnings at Allstate  Financial could eventually improve its strategic importance within the Allstate  enterprise, but Fitch believes it will take time for a significant increase in  earnings to occur. Fitch's rating rationale anticipates a continuation of Allstate's practice of  maintaining liquid assets at the holding company level to fund at least one year  of interest expense, preferred and common dividends, as well as upcoming debt  maturities. Allstate has $3.3 billion in holding company assets at March 31,  2014 that could be liquidated within three months, relative to forecasted annual  interest expense, preferred and common dividends of approximately $890 million,  and remaining 2014 debt maturities of $650 million.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to an upgrade include:  --Sustainable capital position measured by net leverage excluding life company  capital below 3.8x and a score approaching 'Very Strong' on Fitch's proprietary  capital model, Prism; --Reduced volatility in earnings from catastrophe losses and better operating  results consistent with companies in the 'AA' rating category; --Standalone ratings for Allstate's life subsidiaries could rise if their  consolidated statutory Risky Assets/TAC ratio approaches 100% and they are able  to sustain a GAAP-based Return on Assets ratio over 80 basis points.  Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to a downgrade include:  --A prolonged decline in underwriting profitability that is inconsistent with  industry averages or is driven by an effort to grow market share during soft  pricing conditions; --Substantial adverse reserve development that is inconsistent with industry  trends;  --Significant deterioration in capital strength as measured by Fitch's capital  model, NAIC risk-based capital and statutory net leverage. Specifically, if net  leverage excluding life company capital approached 4.8x it would place downward  pressure on ratings; --Significant increases in financial leverage ratio to greater than 30%; --Unexpected and adverse surrender activity on liabilities in the life insurance  operations; --Liquid assets at the holding company reaching less than one year's interest  expense and common dividends.

The following junior subordinated debt at 'BBB-': --6.125% $259 million debenture due May 15, 2067;  --5.10% $500 million subordinated debenture due Jan. 15, 2053; --5.75% $800 million subordinated debenture due Aug. 15, 2053; --6.5% $500 million debenture due May 15, 2067.

153,ALL,Boston has worst drivers of any big U.S. city: Allstate report,"(Reuters) - New York may have its aggressive, horn-honking drivers but it is a bastion of tranquility and safety compared to Boston, home to the worst drivers of any U.S. big city, according to an insurance industry report.  “A Boston driver, on average, will get into a collision every 4.4 years,” Kari Mather, a spokeswoman for insurer Allstate Corp, said on Tuesday. The company’s annual report, titled “Allstate America’s Best Drivers Report,” is based on client collision damage data in 2011 and 2012. It found Boston ranked dead last among cities with more than 1 million residents in their metropolitan area. Next was Washington. The large U.S. city that boasts the best drivers is Phoenix, where a driver, on average, will get into a collision every 9.5 years, Mather said. San Diego and Chicago ranked second and third among big cities. The analysis was weighted to consider factors such as population density and precipitation, Mather said.  Allstate offers automobile insurance to drivers, who are required in most states to carry coverage for their vehicles in case of an accident. Mather said the report’s finding are not used to calculate driver costs, but to raise awareness.  “It’s more about a dialogue of encouraging drivers to be safer on the road. It’s a wakeup call to them,” she said.  The full report included 200 cities. Boston ranked 199th, ahead of only Worcester, Massachusetts, an industrial city of 181,000 people 40 miles to the west. Among other large cities, Chicago ranked 139th, New York City 155th, Houston 158th, Los Angeles 188th, San Francisco 190th, Philadelphia 192nd and Washington 198th.

155,ALL,UPDATE 2-Allstate profit beats estimates as premiums rise,"(Adds CEO comments) By Avik Das Oct 29 (Reuters) - Allstate Corp, the largest publicly traded home and auto insurer in the United States, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as it earned more premiums. The insurer has raised insurance premiums aggressively in the last few years without any significant loss to its share of the highly competitive home and auto insurance markets. Chief Executive Tom Wilson, however, said on Wednesday his company was seeing “less volatility” in pricing. “Price increases are getting much smaller as most of the impact of severe weather has already been reflected in our pricing and profitability,” Wilson told Reuters. Property and casualty insurers’ ability to raise rates have slowed, mainly due to a lack of major catastrophe losses in recent times. Allstate’s net income available to common shareholders rose to $750 million, or $1.74 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $310 million, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier. The year-earlier quarter included an after-tax loss of about $475 million on the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life Co, one of its life insurance businesses, for $600 million to Resolution Life Holdings. For the latest third quarter, property-liability premiums earned rose 4.8 percent to $7.31 billion. Claims rose about 11 percent to $4.91 billion. On an operating basis, Allstate reported earnings of $1.39 per share, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.33 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Consolidated revenue rose about 5.6 percent to $8.94 billion. Catastrophe losses tripled to $517 million.

157,ALL,Fitch Affirms Allstate's Ratings with a Stable Outlook,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A-' Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) of The Allstate Corporation (Allstate) as well as the 'A+' Insurer  Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of Allstate Insurance Co. and its  property/casualty (P/C) affiliates, and the 'A-' IFS ratings of Allstate Life  Insurance Co. and the other life affiliates (Allstate Financial). The Rating  Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Allstate's ratings are supported by its top-tier market position, improved  profitability in P/C insurance and progress in restructuring its life  operations.  The company continues to report good fixed charge coverage and  financial flexibility.  The capitalization of Allstate's P/C operations is  consistent with the current rating category, but consequently holds the rating  down in the 'A' category.   Allstate is the second-largest personal lines insurance writer in the U.S.  behind State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company. Allstate's market  position in private auto slipped to third as rapidly growing Government  Employees Insurance Co. (GEICO) took the second position.  Allstate remains the  second largest writer of homeowners insurance behind State Farm. Underwriting results for Allstate's property/liability business deteriorated but  remained better than Fitch's median guidelines for the current rating category  with a GAAP combined ratio of 95.2% for the first three quarters of 2014  relative to 93.1% for the comparable period in 2013. Catastrophe losses  accounted for 8.8 percentage points on the combined ratio for the first nine  months of 2014 compared to 5.5 points in the comparable period in 2013.   Personal auto accounts for two-thirds of property/liability written premiums and  reported a combined ratio of 96.3% for the first three quarters of 2014, which  was relatively unchanged from the comparable period in 2013.  Nearly one-quarter of Allstate's property/liability written premium comes from  the homeowners line of business. Underwriting results for the homeowners line  continue to be positive, reporting a combined ratio of 90.8% for the first three  quarters of 2014. Catastrophe losses through the first nine months were  responsible for deterioration in the homeowners' combined ratio from 82.4% in  the comparable period in 2013. Combined statutory surplus at Allstate's P/C operations was $18 billion at Sept.  30, 2014.  Surplus remains below pre-financial crisis levels of $19.1 billion  reported at year-end 2006.  Capitalization at Allstate's P/C operations was  considered 'Strong' as measured by Fitch's Prism capital model, which is  consistent with current ratings.  Stated net leverage was 3.2x at Sept. 30,  2014, and approximately 3.9x excluding life company capital. Allstate Financial reported net income of $423 million for the first three  quarters of 2014, up from a modest net loss of $24 million for the comparable  period in 2013.  Allstate Financial's annualized pre-tax operating return on  assets was 0.9% for the first nine months of 2014. Fitch's 'standalone' assessment of Allstate's life operations is 'BBB' for IFS  and its strategic importance within the Allstate enterprise is considered  'Important.'  The ratings of the life operations continue to benefit from the  Capital Support Agreement from Allstate Insurance Co. and its access to the  holding company credit facility.  The life operations focus on traditional underwritten products and de-emphasize  spread-based products, which improves its risk profile. Increased earnings at  Allstate Financial could eventually improve its strategic importance within the  Allstate enterprise, but Fitch believes it will take time for a significant  increase in earnings to occur. Consolidated earnings before interest expense and taxes covered interest expense  and preferred dividends by 8.2x during the first nine months of 2014.  This  level of fixed charge coverage is consistent with Fitch's median guideline for  the current rating category.  Fixed charge coverage has been relatively steady. Fitch's rating rationale anticipates a continuation of Allstate's practice of  maintaining liquid assets at the holding company level to fund at least one year  of interest expense, preferred dividends and common dividends as well as  upcoming debt maturities. Allstate had $2.3 billion in holding company assets at  Sept. 30, 2014 that could be liquidated within three months, relative to  forecasted annual interest expense, and preferred and common dividends of  approximately $880 million.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to an upgrade include:  --Sustainable capital position measured by net leverage excluding life company  capital below 3.8x and a score approaching 'Very Strong' on Fitch's proprietary  capital model, Prism; --Reduced volatility in earnings from catastrophe losses and better operating  results consistent with companies in the 'AA' rating category; --Standalone assessment for Allstate Life Insurance Co. and the other life  affiliates could rise if their consolidated statutory Risky Assets/TAC ratio  reaches approximately 130% and the company is able to sustain a GAAP-based  Return on Assets ratio over 80 basis points; --Ratings for Allstate Life Insurance Co. and the other life affiliates could be  upgraded if its strategic importance changes to 'Very Important' from  'Important.'  Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to a downgrade include:  --A prolonged decline in underwriting profitability that is inconsistent with  industry averages or is driven by an effort to grow market share during soft  pricing conditions; --Substantial adverse reserve development that is inconsistent with industry  trends;  --Significant deterioration in capital strength as measured by Fitch's capital  model, NAIC risk-based capital, and statutory net leverage. Specifically, if net  leverage excluding life company capital approached 4.8x it would place downward  pressure on ratings; --Significant increases in financial leverage ratio to greater than 30%; --Unexpected and adverse surrender activity on liabilities in the life insurance  operations; --Liquid assets at the holding company of less than one year's interest expense,  and preferred and common dividends. Fitch affirms the following ratings for Allstate and subsidiaries:  The Allstate Corporation --Long-term IDR at 'A-'. The following junior subordinated debt at 'BBB-': --6.125% $259 million debenture due May 15, 2067;  --5.10% $500 million subordinated debenture due Jan. 15, 2053; --5.75% $800 million subordinated debenture due Aug. 15, 2053; --6.5% $500 million debenture due May 15, 2067.

158,ALL,"Ohio State runs wild, stuns Alabama in Sugar Bowl","Ohio State runs wild, stuns Alabama in Sugar Bowl NEW ORLEANS — The Ohio State Buckeyes overcame enormous odds this season, losing two starting quarterbacks before handing the job to a redshirt sophomore who never started a regular-season college game. And now, very suddenly, coach Urban Meyer’s Buckeyes are one victory away from an improbable national championship. Sophomore running back Ezekiel Elliott battered Alabama for a Sugar Bowl-record 230 rushing yards, including an 85-yard touchdown burst with 3:24 left, powering No. 4 Ohio State to a 42-35 upset victory over the top-ranked Crimson Tide and a berth in the national championship game against Oregon in Arlington, Texas, on Jan. 12. Alabama entered the game with the nation’s third-ranked defense. “That was a sledgehammer game,” Meyer said after his team advanced to 13-1 with its 12th consecutive victory, Ohio State’s first bowl victory over an Southeastern Conference team in 11 tries. “That was a classic, so we are good enough.” Ohio State was clinging to a 34-28 lead when it took over at its 5-yard line with 5:24 remaining. After the Buckeyes picked up one first down, Elliott, a high school sprinter who was timed at 4.3 seconds in the 40-yard dash, took a handoff off left tackle, broke out of a diving tackle by linebacker Xzavier Dickson and ran unmolested for the score. “I knew going into the game that the Alabama defensive front was going to be very big and physical, and it was going to be hard for our offensive line to get movement,” Elliott said. “But (the Ohio State linemen) did a great job. I knew I had to hit the holes hard and break some arm tackles.” The Buckeyes converted the two-point conversion on a pass from quarterback Cardale Jones to wide receiver Michael Thomas, making it 42-28. Alabama wasn’t dead, traveling 75 yards in six plays to cut the deficit to 42-35 on a 6-yard pass from quarterback Blake Sims to wide receiver Amari Cooper with 1:59 left. The Crimson Tide had one more chance, getting the ball back at its 18 with 1:33 left and no timeouts remaining. After moving the ball to the Ohio State 42, Sims threw a Hail Mary pass into the end zone, but it was intercepted by safety Tyvis Powell as time expired. Meyer said he offered a silent prayer because he made a tactical mistake on Ohio State’s final offensive possession. The Buckeyes recovered the onside kick at their 49-yard line, and Alabama had two timeouts left. Rather than run the ball on first down to force Alabama to use a timeout, Meyer called for a deep pass that fell incomplete, stopping the clock. That helped Alabama get the ball back with extra time remaining. “You start questioning yourself why you threw that ball down the field,” Meyer said. “It was my call. Maybe it wasn’t the right call. I just kept thinking I screwed this thing up.” Jones, who started the Big Ten championship game on Dec. 6 and led the Buckeyes to a 59-0 rout of Wisconsin, had some early jitters but settled down to finish 18 of 35 for 243 yards with one touchdown pass and one interception. He moved into the starting lineup in the absence of Braxton Miller, lost to a shoulder injury in August, and J.T. Barrett, who broke his right ankle in the regular-season finale. Alabama coach Nick Saban said even with just one game of videotape on Jones, he could tell the 6-foot-5, 250-pound quarterback had a rifle arm. He just didn’t know how good it was until he saw it in person. “The new quarterback has a tremendous arm, and they have some very talented receivers,” Saban said. “Those things became very apparent in the last two games because of the quarterback. I think they’re capable of playing with anybody in the country.” Perhaps the critical play of the game came with Alabama trailing 34-28 and 9:53 left. The Crimson Tide (12-2) took over on the Ohio State 23 after a 21-yard punt out of the end zone by Cameron Johnston. However, instead of having his team push the ball with the run — running back Derrick Henry (95 yards on 13 carries) was pounding away at the Ohio State front seven — Saban tried to catch the Buckeyes off guard. He had Sims roll to his right and throw toward the end zone, where his pass for tight end O.J. Howard was badly underthrown and easily intercepted at the goal line by safety Vonn Bell with 9:44 left. “I was anxious to take more shots down the field,” Saban said. “I don’t think we did that enough early in the game.” Of Ohio State’s six scoring drives, none were of the cheap variety, covering 80, 71, 71, 77, 75 and 95 yards. The Buckeyes scored 28 consecutive points after trailing 21-6 late in the second quarter. Ohio State took the lead for good, 27-21, on a 47-yard pass from Jones to wide receiver Devin Smith early in the third quarter. On the play, cornerback Eddie Jackson slipped to the turf at the 10, and Smith was all alone to finish off the TD reception. The Buckeyes scored their fourth consecutive touchdown courtesy of defensive trickery. Facing a third-and-7, Sims thought Cooper was open, but right defensive end Steve Miller dropped into coverage for an interception and returned it 41 yards for a touchdown and a 34-21 Ohio State lead. NOTES: P JK Scott was an unsung hero for Alabama, punting seven times for a 55-yard average and keeping the Buckeyes bottled up. ... Alabama’s struggles in the secondary continued against Ohio State. In the first nine games of the season, Alabama yielded just three completions of 25 yards or longer, but in its last four games, it allowed 13. Ohio State had three 25-plus receptions in the first half. ... Alabama QB Blake Sims completed 22 of 36 passes for 237 yards and two touchdowns with three interceptions.",1022015,http://www.reuters.com/article/fbc-ohiostate-alabama-writethru/ohio-state-runs-wild-stuns-alabama-in-sugar-bowl-idUSMTZEB12JCR53X20150102

161,ALL,Allstate profit beats estimates as premiums rise,"(Reuters) - Allstate Corp (ALL.N), the largest publicly traded home and auto insurer in the United States, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as it earned more premiums, and the company said it would buy back $3 billion in shares. Allstate’s shares, however, fell 2.5 percent in extended trading after the company said claim frequency for auto insurances rose in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. The stock hit an all-time high in regular trading on Wednesday. Allstate’s underlying, or adjusted, combined ratio fell by 2 percentage points to 89.5 during the quarter. Combined ratio is an indicator of the total claims and expenses incurred as a percentage of premiums earned. A combined ratio over 100 indicates that an insurer has an underwriting loss. “Although Allstate had an ok quarter, investors’ focus will be on management’s discussion on change in claim frequency,” Macquarie Securities analyst Amit Kumar said. The company maintained its underlying combined ratio outlook of 87-89 percent for 2015. On an operating basis, Allstate reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.72 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of $1.68 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The insurer has raised insurance premiums aggressively in the last few years without any significant loss to its share of the highly competitive home and auto insurance markets. Property-liability premiums earned during the quarter rose 4.8 percent to $7.35 billion, while property-liability insurance claims rose about 7.8 percent to $4.62 billion. Catastrophe losses decreased about 18.8 percent to $95 million. Property and casualty insurers’ ability to raise premiums has slowed, mainly due to a lack of major catastrophe losses in recent times.

163,ALL,UPDATE 1-Allstate's profit beats Street as catastrophe losses fall,"(Adds detail, compares with analysts’ estimates) May 5 (Reuters) - Allstate Corp, the largest publicly traded home and auto insurer in the United States, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit as losses from natural disasters fell sharply. The company’s catastrophe losses dropped 33.9 percent to $294 million in the first quarter ended March 31. Allstate’s net income available to common shareholders rose to $648 million, or $1.53 per share, in the quarter, from $587 million, or $1.30 per share, a year earlier. On an operating basis, the company reported earnings of $1.46 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of $1.44 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Allstate’s underlying, or adjusted, combined ratio was up marginally at 89 percent, from 88.4 percent a year earlier. Combined ratio is an indicator of the total claims and expenses incurred as a percentage of premiums earned. A combined ratio over 100 indicates that an insurer has an underwriting loss. The insurer has raised premiums aggressively in the past few years without any significant loss to its share of the highly competitive home and auto insurance markets. Revenue from property-liability premiums rose about 5 percent to $7.43 billion. Rival Travelers Cos Inc reported a 21 percent drop in quarterly profit last month, as low interest rates and a drop in value of its energy investments squeezed the company’s net investment income. Allstate’s shares closed at $70 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

165,ALL,Allstate profit misses estimates as claims rise,"(Reuters) - Home and auto insurer Allstate Corp’s (ALL.N) quarterly profit missed analysts’ estimate by a wide margin as the company paid out more in claims. The company’s shares fell 4.2 percent in after-market trading on Monday. Chief Executive Thomas Wilson said the company’s operating income was lower due to increased frequency and severity of auto accidents. “More people have started driving and as more people drive and drive further, they have more accidents. We see this as a continuation of a trend that started last fall,”  Wilson told Reuters. U.S. auto sales were stronger than expected in July and kept the industry on pace for its best performance since the turn of the century due to cheaper gasoline and low interest rates. Claims and claims-related expenses linked to property-liability insurance rose 8.7 percent to $5.59 billion in the second quarter ended June 30. The company’s net income available to common shareholders fell 47 percent to $326 million, or 79 cents per share.

173,ALL,Fitch Affirms Allstate's Ratings; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A-' Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) of the Allstate Corporation (Allstate) as well as the 'A+' Insurer  Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of Allstate Insurance Co. and its  property/casualty (P/C) affiliates. In addition, Fitch affirmed the IFS ratings  of Allstate Life Insurance Co. and its subsidiaries (ALIC) along with American  Heritage Life Insurance Co. (AHLIC) at 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full  list of ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's affirmation is supported by Allstate's top-tier market position in  personal lines insurance, solid underwriting results in P/C insurance, and a  holding company with good financial flexibility.  The capitalization of  Allstate's P/C operations is consistent with the current rating category, but  consequently holds the rating down in the 'A' category.   Allstate has 'large' market position, size and scale that would be consistent  with Fitch's guidelines for a higher rating category.  Allstate is the  second-largest personal lines insurance writer in the U.S. behind State Farm  Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm). Allstate's market position in  private auto is third behind Government Employees Insurance Co. (GEICO) and  State Farm, while its homeowners insurance remains the second largest after  State Farm. Underwriting results for Allstate's property/liability business remained better  than Fitch's median guidelines for the current rating category despite some  deterioration in auto results.  Allstate reported a combined ratio of 95.8% for  the first nine months of 2015 compared to 95.2% for the comparable period in  2014. Catastrophe losses accounted for 6.0 percentage points (pp) on the  combined ratio for the first nine months of 2015, compared to 8.8pp in the  comparable period in 2014.   Personal auto accounts for approximately two-thirds of property/liability  written premiums and reported a combined ratio of 100.1% for the first nine  months of 2015, deteriorating from 96.3% in the comparable period in 2014.  Increased frequency and severity trends were responsible for the period-to-period deterioration in underwriting results. One-fifth of Allstate's property/liability written premium comes from the  homeowners line of business. Underwriting results for the homeowners line  continue to be positive, reporting a combined ratio of 82.7% for the first nine  months of 2015, improving from 90.8% in the comparable period of 2014.  Catastrophe losses through the first nine months of 2015 were down to 19.7% of  earned premium, down from 27.9% in the comparable period of 2014.   Consolidated earnings before interest expense and taxes covered interest expense  and preferred dividends by 8.2x during the first nine months of 2015, unchanged  from the comparable period of 2014.  The fixed charge coverage calculation  excludes realized investment gains of $280 million and includes preferred  dividends of $87 million for the first nine months of 2015. Fixed charge  coverage is consistent with Fitch's median guideline for the current rating  category.   Fitch's rating rationale anticipates a continuation of Allstate's practice of  maintaining liquid assets at the holding company level to fund at least one year  of interest expense, preferred dividends and common dividends, as well as  upcoming debt maturities. Allstate had $3.06 billion in holding company assets  at Sept. 30, 2015 that could be liquidated within three months, relative to  forecast annual interest expense, and preferred and common dividends of  approximately $900 million. Combined statutory surplus at Allstate's P/C operations was $15.8 billion at  Sept. 30, 2015, down $1.2 billion from year-end 2014, as AIC paid $2.1 billion  in dividends to Allstate, exceeding its $1.1 billion in net income over the  period. Fitch expects surplus to grow in the fourth quarter of 2015, since net  income should greatly exceed the approximately $200 million of AIC's remaining  dividend capacity.  Capitalization at Allstate's P/C operations continues to be considered 'Strong'  as measured by Fitch's proprietary Prism capital model, which is consistent with  guidelines for the current rating category.  Stated net leverage was 3.7x at  Sept. 30, 2015, and approximately 4.6x excluding life company capital. Year-to-date through September 2015, ALIC reported net income of $542 million  compared to $343 million for the same period of 2014. The increase was primarily  due to realized investment gains, as the company has strategically repositioned  its portfolio, selling longer-duration fixed income securities and investing  more in private equities and real estate. The company's pre-tax operating income  fell by $60 million, or 11% over this same time period, primarily due to  declining net investment income.  ALIC's risky assets ratio, which increased to 214% in 2014 from 179% in 2013, is  among the highest in Fitch's universe, and may continue to rise due to its  portfolio repositioning if Total Adjusted Capital (TAC) does not increase at a  commensurate level. AHLIC generated a statutory return on assets (ROA) of 5.8%  through the first nine months of 2015 and has a much cleaner investment profile.  The 'standalone' IFS rating on ALIC is 'BBB' with a three-notch uplift applied  for parent support. Fitch views ALIC's strategic importance within the Allstate  enterprise as 'Very Important' and considers the various strategic actions taken  to strengthen its risk profile. The ratings continue to benefit from the Capital  Support Agreement from Allstate Insurance Co. and its access to the holding  company credit facility.  AHLIC's 'standalone' IFS rating of 'A-' reflects an 'Important' strategic  category within the Allstate enterprise. While Fitch views AHLIC's financial  metrics more favorably than ALIC's, the company is seen as less synergistic to  the Allstate enterprise. Thus, AHLIC receives a one-notch uplift in its rating.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to an upgrade include:  --Sustainable capital position measured by net leverage excluding life company  capital below 3.8x and a score approaching 'Very Strong' on Fitch's Prism  capital model; --No material deterioration in underwriting profitability of the property/casualty operations from current levels.  Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade for the life operations  include: --Standalone ratings for ALIC could be upgraded if its statutory Risky  Assets/TAC ratio improved to 130% and the company is able to sustain a  GAAP-based ROA over 80 basis points; --Ratings for ALIC could also be upgraded if Fitch's view of its strategic  importance changes to 'Core' from 'Very Important.' --AHLIC's standalone rating is unlikely to be upgraded in the intermediate term,  due to its relatively small size and scale.  --Ratings for AHLIC could be upgraded if Fitch's view of its strategic  importance changes to 'Very Important' from 'Important' or if the agency's view  of parent support merits a greater degree of uplift. Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to a downgrade include:  --A prolonged decline in underwriting profitability that is inconsistent with  industry averages or is driven by an effort to grow market share during soft  pricing conditions; --Significant deterioration in capital strength as measured by Fitch's capital  model, NAIC risk-based capital, and statutory net leverage. Specifically, if net  leverage excluding life company capital approached 4.8x it would place downward  pressure on ratings; --Significant increases in financial leverage ratio to greater than 30%; --Liquid assets at the holding company of less than one year's interest expense,  and preferred and common dividends. Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade for the life operations  include: --Standalone ratings for ALIC could be downgraded if its statutory Risky  Assets/TAC ratio deteriorates further or GAAP-based ROA declines to 50 basis  points; --AHLIC's standalone rating could be downgraded if financial performance or  capitalization deteriorates significantly; --Ratings for ALIC and AHLIC could be downgraded if Fitch's view of the  strategic categories weaken.

175,ALL,Home insurer Allstate's drone project takes flight,"Dec 17 (Reuters) - Home and auto insurer Allstate Corp  said on Thursday it has been testing drone flights to assess property claims. The company, which has been working with EagleView Technologies to test these drones, said that “drone flights are seen as possible improvements to claims efficiency for Allstate, especially after a catastrophe”. The insurer said that when physical access to a neighborhood is restricted by local authorities or by debris after disasters, a drone could help claims professionals serve customers. “Drones can do things more safely and easier than a lot of what we do today,” Allstate Claims Strategy and Innovation Vice President Shawn Broadfield said. The company has also joined the Property Drone Consortium, which has received approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to use drones for further research that can help expedite the assessment of exterior property, like roof damage. The consortium also plans to continue its research on safety, including collision avoidance, visual line of sight and other areas with drones, Allstate said.

181,ALL,Fitch Affirms Allstate's Long-Term Ratings; Revises ALIC's Outlook to Negative,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A-' Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) of the Allstate Corporation (Allstate) as well as the 'A+' Insurer  Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of Allstate Insurance Co. and its  property/casualty (P/C) affiliates with a Stable Outlook. Fitch has also  downgraded the short-term IDR of Allstate to 'F2' from 'F1'. Additionally, Fitch  affirmed the IFS ratings of Allstate Life Insurance Co. and its subsidiaries  (collectively referred to as ALIC) at 'A' and revised the Rating Outlook to  Negative from Stable. Finally, Fitch affirmed American Heritage Life Insurance  Co.'s (AHLIC) IFS rating at 'A' with a Stable Outlook. A full list of ratings  follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's affirmation of P/C affiliates and holding company long-term ratings is  supported by Allstate's top-tier market position in personal lines insurance,  and solid underwriting results in P/C insurance. The capitalization of  Allstate's P/C operations is consistent with the current rating category.  The downgrade of Allstate's short-term IDR to 'F2' from 'F1' reflects an  increase in the potential need for holding company liquidity. Specifically,  catastrophe losses at the P/C operations could require capital contributions,  since the capital cushion at the operating subsidiaries has deteriorated over  the past couple of years. In addition, greater investment risk at the life  operations along with weakening operating performance could also require the  holding company's liquidity resources. Fitch's revised ALIC's Outlook to Negative as a result of its increasing  investment risk, with its portfolio among the riskiest in Fitch's rated life  universe. Allstate's life operations have a materially lower standalone rating  than the P/C operations given its relatively moderate scale and market position  as well as its lower strategic importance. Consequently, the life operations  receive significant rating uplift as part of the Allstate enterprise. Allstate has a 'large' market position, size and scale that would be consistent  with Fitch's guidelines for a higher rating category. Allstate is the  second-largest personal lines insurance writer in the U.S. behind State Farm  Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm). Allstate's market position in  private auto is third behind Government Employees Insurance Co. (GEICO) and  State Farm, while its homeowners insurance remains the second largest after  State Farm. The combined ratio for Allstate's property/liability business averaged 94.1%  over the last four years (2012-2015), exceeding Fitch's median guidelines for  the current rating category. Greater catastrophe losses during the first quarter  of 2016 (1Q16) inflated the combined ratio to 98.4% compared to 93.7% for the  comparable period in 2015. Catastrophe losses accounted for 10.7 percentage  points (pp) on the combined ratio for the first three months of 2016, compared  to 4pp in the comparable period in 2015. Catastrophe losses remain elevated with  $835 million in pretax losses during April and May of 2016, which is comparable  to 1Q16's total. Personal auto accounts for approximately two-thirds of property/liability  written premiums and reported a combined ratio of 99.7% for the first three  months of 2016, up from 98.5% in the comparable period in 2015 and essentially  flat from full-year 2015. Catastrophe losses in the 1Q amounted to 2.7pp of the  combined ratio, masking improvement in the underlying underwriting results.  Nearly one-quarter of Allstate's property/liability written premium comes from  the homeowners line of business. Underwriting results for the homeowners line  were also adversely impacted by catastrophe losses during 1Q16. Homeowners  reported a combined ratio of 94.1% for the first three months of 2016,  deteriorating from 79.2% in the comparable period of 2015. Catastrophe losses in  1Q16 were 33.9pp of earned premium, up from 13.9pp in the comparable period of  2015.  Combined statutory surplus at Allstate's P/C operations was $16.1 billion at  year-end 2015, down $1.9 billion over the last two years as AIC pays dividends  in excess of earnings to support Allstate's share repurchase activity. Further  deterioration in capitalization at the P/C operating company level would place  downward pressure on ratings. Capitalization at Allstate's P/C operations continues to deteriorate when  measured using Fitch's proprietary Prism capital model as well as NAIC  Risk-Based Capital, operating and net leverage ratios. Adjusted net leverage,  excluding life company capital, was 4.5x at year-end 2015, approaching Fitch's  downgrade trigger of 5.0x. In 1Q16, ALIC reported net income of $52 million compared to $153 million for  the prior year period. The decline was driven by realized investment losses and  reduced net investment income, as the company is strategically repositioning its  portfolio by selling longer-duration fixed income securities and increasing its  exposure to private equities and real estate. ALIC's risky assets ratio, which  increased to 241% in 2015 from 212% in 2014, is among the highest in Fitch's  universe, and may continue to rise due to its portfolio repositioning if total  adjusted capital (TAC) does not increase at a commensurate level. AHLIC  generated a statutory return on assets (ROA) of 3.2% in 1Q16 and has a much  cleaner investment profile.  ALIC's 'standalone' IFS rating of has been revised to 'BBB-' from 'BBB'  reflecting the company's elevated investment risk. However, ALIC receives a  four-notch uplift for parent support, elevating its IFS rating to 'A'. Fitch  views ALIC's strategic importance within the Allstate enterprise as 'Very  Important' and considers the various strategic actions taken to strengthen its  risk profile. The ratings continue to benefit from the Capital Support Agreement  from Allstate Insurance Co. and its access to the holding company credit  facility. Based upon its standalone assessment and strategic importance, ALIC's  final rating is capped at one notch below its parent, and any further  deterioration in its standalone assessment will result in a downgrade. AHLIC's 'standalone' IFS rating of 'A-' reflects an 'Important' strategic  category within the Allstate enterprise. While Fitch views AHLIC's financial  metrics more favorably than ALIC's, the company is seen as less synergistic to  the Allstate enterprise. Thus, AHLIC receives a one-notch uplift in its rating.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to an upgrade include:  --Sustainable capital position measured by net leverage excluding life company  capital below 3.8x and a score approaching 'Very Strong' on Fitch's Prism  capital model; --No material deterioration in underwriting profitability of the property/casualty operations from current levels.  Given its Negative Outlook, Fitch considers an upgrade of ALIC unlikely over the  near- to intermediate-term. The following rating triggers could result in a  revision of ALIC's Outlook to Stable from Negative: --An improvement in statutory Risky Assets/TAC ratio to 200% with operating  performance remaining stable; --Fitch's view of its strategic importance changes to 'Core' from 'Very  Important.' Given its relatively small size and scale, AHLIC is unlikely to be upgraded in  the near- to intermediate-term, but the following could result in an upgrade  over the longer term:  --Fitch's view of its strategic importance changes to 'Very Important' from  'Important' or if the agency's view of parent support merits a greater degree of  uplift. Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to a downgrade include:  --A prolonged decline in underwriting profitability that is inconsistent with  industry averages or is driven by an effort to grow market share during soft  pricing conditions; --Significant deterioration in capital strength as measured by Fitch's capital  model, NAIC risk-based capital, and statutory net leverage. Specifically, if net  leverage excluding life company capital approached 5.0x it would place downward  pressure on ratings; --Significant increases in financial leverage ratio to greater than 30%; --Liquid assets at the holding company of less than one year's interest expense,  and preferred and common dividends. Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade for ALIC include: --Statutory Risky Assets/TAC ratio deteriorates further; --Fitch's view of its strategic importance weakens. Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade for AHLIC include: --Financial performance or capitalization deteriorates significantly; --Fitch's view of its strategic importance weakens. Fitch affirms the following ratings for Allstate with a Stable Outlook:  The Allstate Corporation --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; --Preferred stock at 'BB+'; The following senior unsecured debt at 'BBB+': --6.75% $176 million debenture due May 15, 2018; --7.45% $317 million debenture due May 16, 2019;  --3.15% $500 million debenture due June 15, 2023; --6.125% $159 million note due Dec. 15, 2032;  --5.35% $323 million note due June 1, 2033; --5.55% $546 million note due May 9, 2035; --5.95% $386 million note due April 1, 2036; --6.9% $165 million debenture due May 15, 2038; --5.2% $62 million note due Jan. 15, 2042; --4.5% $500 million note due June 15, 2043.

210,ALL,Insurance veteran Cowdery raising money for Bermuda fund-sources,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - British insurance entrepreneur Clive Cowdery is raising money for a fourth investment vehicle, at the same time as his third, U.S.-focused fund is being wound down and its sole asset put up for sale, sources aware of the matter told Reuters. Cowdery, founder of The Resolution Group, is one of UK insurance’s biggest names, having spent more than a decade acquiring life insurance companies that were usually closed to new clients and then implementing cost savings to help bolster returns. The new Bermuda-based fund will maintain the same focus by reinsuring closed-book businesses in the United States and Europe, according to two sources aware of the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the information isn’t public. Jonathan Moss, chief financial officer of Aviva’s (AV.L) French business, has been lined up to run the fund, one source added. Moss was chief executive of what is now Phoenix Group (PHNX.L) when it bought Cowdery’s first Resolution fund in 2008. The fund is looking for commitments from investors of a couple of billion dollars, a second source said. A spokesman for Resolution declined to comment. Moss did not respond to request for comment. Life insurance and annuity businesses have been difficult areas for traditional insurance firms as they have struggled to make enough money to cover long-term payouts in the low interest rate environment. Many have chosen to sell these units to private equity and specialist firms such as Resolution. Atlas Merchant Capital, led by former Barclays Chief Executive Bob Diamond, is close to buying Hartford Financial Services’ (HIG.N) annuity run-off business for as much as $3.5 billion, sources said last month, and Dutch insurer Aegon NV (AEGN.AS) completed the sale of the majority of its U.S. run-off business, worth $14 billion, to Wilton Re in June. In Europe, Italian insurer Generali (GASI.MI) has put its 44 billion euro  ($51.7 billion) German closed life insurance portfolio up for sale, sources told Reuters last month. British insurer Prudential (PRU.L) said on Thursday it may sell part of its 45 billion pound ($58.4 billion) closed annuity book.     Reinsurance is an alternative for sellers to offloading the businesses altogether. Meanwhile, Cowdery’s third fund, Resolution Life, is marketing Nebraska-based Lincoln Benefit Life to potential buyers as the fund is wound down, five sources aware of the matter said. Initial bids were due in at the end of July, according to two sources, with the closed provider of life insurance and annuities expected to fetch in the region of $500 million. Morgan Stanley is advising Resolution Life. There are questions over whether the company will ultimately be sold, with two of the sources noting Cowdery could choose to transfer ownership of Lincoln to his new fund if Resolution Life was unhappy with the tabled offers. The aborted sale would then become a way for Cowdery to calculate an updated market value for the business, since it was bought from Allstate Corp (ALL.N) in 2014 for $600 million. While a depreciation in the asset’s value is to be expected, given no new policies are being written and existing ones are being managed to maturity, the fact most of the $2 billion of capital which Resolution Life had to deploy remains uninvested is likely to be a bone of contention with investors, two of the sources said. Blackstone (BX.N) and Prudential Financial (PRU.N) are among the investors in Resolution Life, sources said. Blackstone declined to comment and Prudential Financial did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

214,ALL,Allstate CEO calls for revamping U.S. flood insurance system,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Allstate Corp’s Chief Executive Officer Tom Wilson on Tuesday called on U.S. lawmakers to overhaul a government subsidized flood insurance program, calling for a more streamlined system that does not overburden taxpayers. Allstate, the second-largest U.S. homeowners’ insurer based on premiums collected, is concerned that efforts by lawmakers and advocacy groups to reform the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) will fall flat. “The flood insurance situation needs to be completely redone,” Wilson said. Lawmakers are wrestling with how to handle the insurance coverage of homeowners in flood-prone areas. The NFIP is nearly $25 billion in debt to the U.S. Treasury. Both Republicans and Democrats want to reform the program, which has been extended repeatedly since it was established in 2008 and is set to expire on Dec. 8. The impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which hit Texas and Florida in recent weeks, has added urgency to the issue.  The combined claims from the two storms will ultimately exceed NFIP’s spending authority, a situation for Congress to fix, NFIP Director Roy Wright in a telephone interview. Harvey claims could total $11 billion, while it is too early to estimate total Irma claims, said Wright. But Allstate’s Wilson was concerned that efforts to reform NFIP would be short-lived. “Once these hurricanes go past, once the tornadoes go past, people tend to have short memories,” Wilson said on the sidelines of an investor conference in New York. Wilson envisions a streamlined insurance system for floods and wind damage, instead of a “patchwork” that relies on federal government-backed flood coverage and some state-backed insurers for wind and hail. Insurers and reinsurers have been making similar arguments for years. Lower-risk property owners also need to be part of the system to make it function well, Wilson said.  “Not enough people buy it, and the people who do buy it use it more than they should,” he said, adding that the coverage is limited and sold for less than it is worth. NFIP limits, up to $250,000 for residences and $100,000 for contents, were last changed in 1994. The policies also do not cover additional living expenses or damage to basements. “Congress needs to give us more authority to change those coverages and align things in ways that conform to the industry,” Wilson said. Allstate would consider selling private flood insurance if the system is fixed, he said.  “We insure all kinds of stuff,” Wilson said. “But it’s got to be a better market.”  ",9202017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-insurance-allstate/allstate-ceo-calls-for-revamping-u-s-flood-insurance-system-idUSKCN1BU2OX
