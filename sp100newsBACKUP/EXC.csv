1,EXC,Retailers supply more than half of Illinois power," NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - More than half of the electric demand in Illinois now comes from competitive power suppliers, according to a report by state utility regulators.   At the end of 2010, 97,020 customers were buying power from competitive suppliers rather than the state’s traditional utilities, Exelon’s (EXC.N) Commonwealth Edison and Ameren’s (AEE.N) Ameren Illinois utilities, according to the Illinois Commerce Commission’s Office of Retail Market Development.   “The new statistics show that retail electric choice continues to thrive in Illinois with more than 58 percent of all electric load now served by competitive suppliers,” Roy Boston, Illinois State Chair for the Retail Energy Supply Association (RESA), said Thursday in a release.   Most customers who have switched electric suppliers were commercial and industrial businesses seeking to lower costs and better manage their power usage.   But in ComEd’s territory, RESA said nearly 83,000 residential customers also switched suppliers as of late June.   There are 37 suppliers certified to sell power in Illinois - 18 in Ameren’s territory and 24 in ComEd’s territory, according to the state report and the RESA release.   In the mid 1990s, all U.S. states looked into opening their power markets to competition, but most decided not to pursue deregulation following the collapse of the restructured California energy market in 2000 and 2001.   In a deregulated state, consumers have the option to pick their power supplier. Today, there are about 15 deregulated states, plus the District of Columbia. Other states, like California, are slowly opening their markets to competition once again.   RESA represents retail electric suppliers including units of investor-owned energy companies Consolidated Edison (ED.N), Constellation Energy CEG.N, Centrica (CNA.L), Exelon, GDF SUEZ GSZ.PA, NRG Energy (NRG.N), Hess (HES.N), Integrys Energy TEG.N, Just Energy (JE.TO), DPL DPL.N, NextEra Energy (NEE.N) and PPL (PPL.N).

2,EXC,UPDATE 1-Storms trigger near-record Chicago power outages," (Updates with new numbers from ComEd)   By Karin Matz   CHICAGO, July 11 (Reuters) - A powerful front of thunderstorms packing winds as strong as 75 miles per hour raked Chicago during the morning commute on Monday, knocking out power to a near-record 817,000 customers.   “It’s one for our record books,” said Tony Hernandez, a spokesman for the utility company, ComEd.   While the nation’s third largest city was recovering from the sudden storm, much of the rest of the country was experiencing stifling heat, with one man dying of heat stroke on Sunday night in southern Illinois.   The Chicago area storm also prompted the National Weather Service to issue a rare warning of tidal wave-like conditions on the shores of Lake Michigan. Strong waves hit the shores and there were major fluctuations in waves. The warning remained in effect for the Indiana shores of the Lake Michigan until 8 p.m. local time.   As of 3 p.m. CDT Monday, Exelon Corp (EXC.N) unit ComEd reported 561,000 customers without power in the region, and 92,000 without power in the city of Chicago.  ComEd said the outages from this storm are second only to one in 1998 when 861,000 customers lost power.   The storms, which passed through the Chicago area quickly, downed numerous trees and power lines, and prompted delays on commuter train lines and at Chicago’s two airports.   A heat advisory was in effect in more than a dozen states on Monday, with temperatures expected to climb to potentially dangerous levels.   Thermometers will hang around the 100-degree mark in the central and southern plains and middle and lower Mississippi Valley, according to the National Weather Service.   In some places, heat index values will exceed 115 degrees.   “High pressure dominates the Southeastern corner of the United States,” said NWS Metrologist Jim Keeney, who expected the heat to hover through early next week.    The heat wave broke records in places such as Joplin, Missouri, where a May 22 tornado destroyed about 30 percent of the city.   The temperature reached 106 degrees there on Sunday, a record for that date and the hottest for any day in Joplin in 25 years, according to the weather service.   A temperature of 102 was forecast for Monday.   Heavy rains are a concern for the area along the Missouri River, where there already is flooding. More rain could result in continued and prolonged flooding.

The storms, which passed through the Chicago area quickly, downed numerous trees and power lines, and prompted delays on commuter train lines of up to three hours.   The storms also snarled air traffic at the region’s main airports and delayed flights by almost an hour.   The Chicago Department of Aviation said delays at O’Hare International Airport were about 45 minutes. At Midway Airport, delays were about 50 minutes.   Airlines with hubs at O’Hare and Midway said the morning storms could delay flights all day throughout their systems.   “O’Hare was shut down for 48 minutes this morning due to heavy storms,” said Ed Martelle, spokesman for AMR Corp’s AMR.N American Airlines, which has a hub at O’Hare.

4,EXC,"Analysis:After Japan, slow change seen for U.S. nuclear industry","WASHINGTON/HOUSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. nuclear industry this week gets its first peek at a roadmap for new regulations that ultimately could cost it billions in the wake of Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi disaster.  But the bottom-line impact of Fukushima on the U.S. fleet of 104 reactors could take most of the next decade to calculate.  Most expect Tuesday’s report from a task force of senior staff members at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to be just the first step in years of deliberation and rule-making to ensure U.S. plants can better withstand catastrophes like the March earthquake and tsunami that wrecked the Fukushima plant.  The head of the U.S. NRC has said he wants the agency to move as fast as it can to ensure the world’s largest nuclear power producer can withstand catastrophes.  The last time the commission carried out such regulatory soul-searching — after the September 11, 2001 attacks — it took a decade to get the entire plan in place.  After Fukushima, the world’s worst nuclear accident in 25 years, the NRC is expected to step up requirements for U.S. plants to be able keep running even if they lose power for days or weeks.  “I do think that the industry is expecting to make some changes that will cost a great deal of money,” said Craven Crowell, a former chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, a government-owned utility, who has worked in the nuclear industry for more than 30 years.  The changes could be expensive for plant owners, such as Exelon, Entergy and PG&E, and could affect the first new plants planned in 30 years — Southern Co’s Vogtle plant in Georgia and SCANA Corp’s facility in South Carolina.  It will take time for NRC staff and the five-member commission to agree on the detailed changes needed, and send those changes through the tortuous rule-making process.  “In general, we’re probably looking at a two- to three-year timeframe, at least,” said Daniel Stenger, a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of law firm Hogan Lovells that focuses on nuclear energy.  The sometimes-fractious commission will need to find consensus to move forward. Commissioners are slated to give their first public statements on the task force recommendations at a public hearing on July 19.  NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko, seen as the most activist member of the commission, has urged an expedited timeline.  “It, I think, will not be acceptable if 10 years from now we’re still working through the recommendations of this task force,” Jaczko said at a May hearing.  The NRC last overhauled its rules after the September 11, 2001 attacks, when plants were seen as potential targets. It took until 2009 for the agency to finalize a comprehensive set of rules, and one regulation concerning emergency preparedness has yet to be finalized.  Almost 10 years later, a dozen of the 64 nuclear power stations in the country are still working to comply with the rules, according to NRC records.  “There is no question that the nuclear industry dragged its feet after 9/11 in implementing the security upgrades needed to adequately protect their plants against terrorist attacks,” said Edwin Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group that advocates for nuclear safety.  NRC officials said that while the beefed-up security measures took years to finalize, interim safety measures were already in place at nuclear facilities around the country.  “We took a full array of comprehensive, substantial steps that were in place by October 2004 in direct response to NRC requirements within the deadline that was established at the time,” said Steve Kerekes, a spokesman for the industry’s trade group, the Nuclear Energy Institute.  The 1986 Chernobyl disaster led to little U.S. industry change due to major design differences between U.S. plants and the Russian reactor that lacked safety features, accident alert procedures and close regulation.  After the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979, President Jimmy Carter appointed a 12-member commission within two weeks to study and recommend changes for plants.  That work took about 18 months, but some of the changes were later found to be unnecessary and counterproductive.  The industry created a peer-review group, the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, to raise safety standards. INPO has been suggested as a model for a global nuclear enforcement agency after Fukushima.  It took about a decade before the industry and regulator fully understood what happened at Three Mile Island, recalled Margaret Harding, a former vice president at GE-Hitachi responsible for engineering quality.  It will take years before all the details of the Fukushima disaster are fully understood, and some of the most technical changes may need to wait until the jury is in, Harding said.  “It’s kind of like recalling cars without knowing what’s wrong,” said Harding, now an industry consultant.  But the NRC does not need to wait for all the details on the disaster to know that it needs to examine how well-equipped plants are to withstand a long-term power blackout, she said.  “Our expectation is that it’s going to take years to fully digest and discern lessons from Japan,” the NEI’s Kerekes said. “That doesn’t mean we are waiting; we’ve already taken numerous steps and we will continue to do that.”  The release of the task force report is expected to kick off a second, more detailed six-month review in which the public and the industry can share their views with the NRC.  The NRC has so far ignored public calls to hold off on renewing operating licenses for aging plants and making decisions on new reactor designs until the Fukushima reviews are complete.  “We want a procedure set up so that new licenses and renewed licenses are not approved unless there’s an opportunity for public participation,” said Diane Curran, a public interest lawyer in Washington who has represented groups fighting power plants for 30 years.  The NRC needs to take its time to examine fully whether its rules and inspections need to be ratcheted up to deal with disasters that go beyond the “design basis” that plants are currently required to live up to, Curran said.  “It does seem to be one of the lessons of the Fukushima accident that the whole regulatory program needs to shift,” she said.

5,EXC,UPDATE 5-Storms trigger near-record Chicago power outages," (Adds details from Nashville, heat advisory from NWS)   By Karin Matz   CHICAGO, July 11 (Reuters) - A powerful front of thunderstorms packing winds as strong as 75 miles (120 kilometers) per hour raked Chicago during the morning commute on Monday, knocking out power to a near-record 817,000 customers.   “It’s one for our record books,” said Tony Hernandez, a spokesman for utility company ComEd, a unit of Exelon Corp (EXC.N).   While the nation’s third largest city was recovering from the sudden storm, much of the rest of the country was experiencing stiffing heat, with one man dying of heat stroke on Sunday night in southern Illinois.   Madison County, Illinois Coroner Stephen Nonn said the body temperature of Mitsunari Uechi of Granite City, Illinois, was 104 degrees F (40 degrees C) when he arrived at the hospital. The air conditioning at his home was not operating.   In Nashville, where the heat index — which takes into account relative humidity as well as air temperature — was expected to hit 110 on Monday and Tuesday, the parks and recreation department turned many of its facilities into cooling stations and the police department said it was conducting welfare checks.   The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for most of Kentucky and for parts of Ohio, Missouri, Mississippi, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Alabama, Indiana and Illinois, as well as Tennessee. It said the dangerously high temperatures and humidity would last through Tuesday.   Thermometers will hang around the 100-degree mark in the central and southern plains and middle and lower Mississippi Valley, according to the National Weather Service.   In some places, heat index values will exceed 115 degrees.   “High pressure dominates the Southeastern corner of the United States,” said NWS Metrologist Jim Keeney, who expected the heat to hover through early next week.    The heat wave broke records in places such as Joplin, Missouri, where a May 22 tornado destroyed about 30 percent of the city.   The temperature reached 106 degrees there on Sunday, a record for that date and the hottest for any day in Joplin in 25 years, according to the weather service.   A temperature of 102 was forecast for Monday.   “It’s just one more thing for people to deal with,” said Patricia Robinson, a volunteer at the Joplin Red Cross.   The Red Cross building would normally be used as a public cooling center but staff members are still busy helping tornado victims, Robinson said.   Kansas City, Missouri, was under an ozone alert on Monday because of the unhealthy amount of smog, said the Mid-America Regional Council.   And in the Kansas City area, several buildings, such as all 19 branches of the YMCA, were opened as cooling centers. Free use of the buildings and pools is expected to draw an average of 100 people per location, said Paula Oxler, a spokeswoman for the Kansas City area YMCAs.   Heat illnesses are possible in areas with hot temperatures and high humidity. Weather experts recommend drinking plenty of fluids, staying out of the sun and staying in an air-conditioned room.   The Chicago area storm also prompted the National Weather Service to issue a rare warning of tidal wave-like conditions on the shores of Lake Michigan. Strong waves hit the shores and there were major fluctuations in waves.   Chicago utility ComEd reported 561,000 customers without power in the region at midafternoon, and 92,000 without power in the city of Chicago.   ComEd said the outages from this storm are second only to one in 1998 when 861,000 customers lost power.

A task force report published on Wednesday recommended the Nuclear Regulatory Commission look at a fundamental shift in how it plans for catastrophes like the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in March.  Critics and proponents of nuclear power had broadly similar reactions: while the proposal was more far-reaching than many expected, it stopped short of recommending a major overhaul and focused on incremental improvements that would unify a patchwork of previous regulations and recommendations.  The big question now is which ideas the five-member NRC accepts, and how quickly it proceeds to reform an industry in which plant retrofits can cost millions of dollars. It could affect the viability of plans for new plants that already face tough competition from cheap natural gas.  ""Done poorly, they could significantly increase costs in the current operating fleet without improving safety one iota,"" said Margaret Harding, a former vice president at GE-Hitachi (6501.T) responsible for quality, and now an industry consultant.

Utilities and plant operators such as Exelon (EXC.N), Entergy (ETR.N), and PG&E (PCG.N) could be affected by new regulatory changes.  The task force found no immediate safety issues, but focused on how well plants can cope when earthquakes, floods or other disasters wipe out power supplies needed to keep radioactive fuel cool.  The U.S. industry has a patchwork of mandatory regulations and voluntary guidelines, and the task force sought to streamline them.  The report called for more stringent requirements for reactors that share the same design as those in Fukushima, which could be costly but not unusual for the industry, said Mark Prelas, director of research at the University of Missouri's Nuclear Science and Engineering Institute.  On its own, the industry had already planned to build regional emergency response centers, a plan that could cost each of the reactors $9 million to $10 million over the next decade, IHS analyst Mahn noted, citing industry figures.  The Nuclear Energy Institute said it is unlikely the report will lead to any plant shutdowns.  ""It's premature to determine how expensive.

8,EXC,RPT-FACTBOX-U.S. nuclear reactors similar to Fukushima," (Repeats to fix technical problem.

A task force recommended the Nuclear Regulatory Commission look at a fundamental shift in how it plans for catastrophes like the earthquake and tsunami that swamped the Fukushima plant in March, the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 25 years.  Now it is up to the five-member commission to decide which ideas to accept and how quickly to proceed in an industry where plant retrofits can run into the millions.

9,EXC,Factbox: Reaction to U.S. nuclear safety report,"(Reuters) - A U.S. task force formed after Japan’s nuclear crisis called for tougher safety rules and improvements to reactor design in a report released on Wednesday.  The report, the result of the most in-depth review of U.S. nuclear power in a decade, suggested a more comprehensive regulatory structure is needed. Some experts said it could lead to new costs for reactor operators if the recommendations are implemented.  Here are some reactions to the task force’s report:  Charles Miller, head of the NRC task force  “We looked at ensuring protection, enhancing accident mitigation, strengthening emergency preparedness and improving the efficiency of NRC programs. The independence given our team was outstanding. Everything was on the table and we felt free to take a holistic approach to these key subjects.”  Claudia Mahn, energy analyst with IHS Global Insight  “Even though the task force’s report seems more far-reaching than any other global nuclear safety updates that have been considered so far, it is probably merely addressing the obvious, rather than revolutionizing the U.S. nuclear power market.”  Margaret Harding, president, 4 Factor Consulting  “The issue with the NRC performing ‘soul-searching’ will be in how they implement this approach. Done poorly, they could significantly increase costs in the current operating fleet without improving safety one iota. Done well, and they will get at the real issues, eliminate the vagueness in the regulation and improve safety.”  Richard Zuercher, spokesman, Dominion Resources  “We are in the process of reviewing the report. Many of the items outlined in the report have already been addressed. Once we conduct a detailed review we will be able to assess any additional implications.”  Tony Pietrangelo, chief nuclear officer, Nuclear Energy Institute  “It’s premature to determine how expensive. There will be some costs incurred as a result of the enhancements.”  “Generally speaking, permanent plant modifications are more expensive than emergency equipment that’s portable or staged in the yard for these types of extreme events.”  Congressman Edward Markey, ranking Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee  “I urge the NRC to quickly move to order the adoption of the recommendations of this report ... before the issuance of any new nuclear power plant design or license, or approval of any relicense application.”  Senator James Inhofe, ranking Republican on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works  “A nuclear accident in Japan should not automatically be viewed as an indictment of U.S. institutional structures and nuclear safety requirements ... Changes in our system may be necessary, but sweeping revisions are premature without first taking into account the full extent of the differences between the United States’ and Japan’s nuclear safety regulations.”  Arnie Gundersen, chief engineer, Fairewinds Associates  “These NRC recommendations are plain vanilla and are designed to avoid the costly modifications to really fix the problem, especially the 1989 ‘industry initiative’ on containment vents.

11,EXC,UPDATE 3-US report urges overhaul of nuclear rules," * Total of 34 recommendations made in 82-page report  * Looked at how to improve US safety after Fukushima  * Recommends tougher approach to emergency plans  * No imminent risk seen from current system-report  * “It’s a laundry list”-analyst  (Adds comments and details throughout)  By Roberta Rampton and Eileen O’Grady  WASHINGTON/HOUSTON, July 12 (Reuters) - A key task force formed after the Fukushima disaster recommended the U.S. nuclear regulator take a new, tougher approach to safety, which could force plants to plan for catastrophes far beyond what they were originally designed to withstand.  In the most far-reaching review of U.S. nuclear safety since the Sept. 11 attacks a decade ago, the report suggests a philosophical shift is needed to unify a patchwork of formal rules and industry guidelines, ensuring all are overseen by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  Among the 34 recommendations, the task force urged tougher standards for back-up power supplies, back-up water supplies for pools holding plant waste, and improvements in reactors that share the same design as Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi plant.  The report is the U.S. government’s most definitive response yet to the earthquakes and floods that caused a partial meltdown at Fukushima. America’s response could set a template for other nations that look to the world’s biggest nuclear power generator to set the standard for safety.  If adopted, the report could lead to cost increases for operators of the nation’s fleet of 104 reactors, such as Exelon (EXC.N), Entergy (ETR.N), and PG&E (PCG.N). The industry is already grappling with the competitive threat from cheap and abundant supplies of natural gas.  It’s hard to say how much the ideas could cost the industry, said Christine Tezak, an energy policy analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co, noting much will depend on details of decisions still to be made by the NRC.  “It’s a laundry list. Whether this adds up to a cooling tower and puts you out of business, it’s too early to tell,” Tezak said.  The five-member Nuclear Regulatory Commission will need to decide whether the regulatory shift is warranted. The task force did not find any immediate safety issues.  “The current regulatory approach and more importantly the resultant plant capabilities allowed the task force to conclude that a sequence of events like that in Fukushima is unlikely to occur in the United States,” according to the report obtained by Reuters Tuesday evening.  The report, which the NRC will officially release on Wednesday, is likely to disappoint nuclear critics who had called for the U.S. regulator to pause on renewing licenses for aging plants, and making decisions on new reactors. The task force did not go that far.  “Continued operation and continued licensing activities do not pose an imminent risk to public health and safety,” the report said.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   FACTBOX-What’s in the task force report?

It could take years before officials fully understand what happened there, prompting a senior lawmaker to label the task force ideas as premature.  “Why has the NRC suddenly recommended sweeping regulatory changes in this report apparently without an adequate technical or regulatory basis to justify these modifications?” said James Inhofe, senior Republican on the Senate’s Environment and Public Works committee, which has oversight of the NRC.  The Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry lobby group, also said more information was needed from Japan.  “A 90-day review does not permit a complete picture of a still-emerging situation,” the group said in a statement.  But Representative Edward Markey, a Democrat and long-time industry critic, said the NRC should move ahead quickly.  Markey said he was disappointed the report did not enlarge emergency evacuation zones around nuclear power plants, nor recommend that spent fuel be moved into dry casks from pools, where most of the radioactive waste is currently stored.  The task force praised new reactors that include passive features, saying the new designs would be in line with many of its recommendations. It urged the NRC to complete its review “without delay” of Toshiba Corp’s (6502.T) Westinghouse AP1000 reactor and GE-Hitachi’s (6501.T) Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor.  The AP1000 is the reactor design of choice for the nation’s first new nuclear plants in 30 years — Southern Co (SO.N) in Georgia and SCANA Corp (SCG.N) in South Carolina.  The NRC will next embark on a six-month broader review, and is expected to invite industry and the public to participate.  Commissioners are slated to give their first public statements on the task force recommendations at a public hearing on July 19, while Chairman Gregory Jaczko — who is pushing for an expedited response — will speak publicly at a National Press Club event a day earlier.

12,EXC,U.S. report proposes overhaul of nuclear rules,"WASHINGTON/HOUSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. nuclear safety regulator should weigh an overhaul of its rules and guidelines used to keep plants safe when disaster strikes, a task force recommended on Tuesday, according to a source familiar with its report.  In the most far-reaching review of U.S. nuclear safety since the September 11 attacks a decade ago, the report explores whether a philosophical shift is needed would force utilities to comply with additional rules in the wake of Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi disaster.  The report, if adopted, could lead to cost increases for operators of the nation’s fleet of 104 reactors, such as Exelon, Entergy, and PG&E.  It could also affect utilities planning the nation’s first new nuclear plants in 30 years — Southern Co in Georgia and SCANA Corp in South Carolina — although new nuclear plants are already grappling with the competitive threat from cheap and abundant supplies of natural gas.  But the five-member Nuclear Regulatory Commission would first need to decide whether the shift is warranted. The task force, in its series of 34 recommendations, did not find any immediate safety issues.  “The current regulatory approach and more importantly the resultant plant capabilities allowed the task force to conclude that a sequence of events like that in Fukushima is unlikely to occur in the United States,” said a copy of the report obtained by Reuters.  The report is likely to disappoint nuclear critics who had called for the U.S. regulator to pause on renewing licenses for aging plants, and making decisions on new reactors — but the task force did not go that far, the source said.  “Continued operation and continued licensing activities do not pose an imminent risk to public health and safety,” the report said.  FUKUSHIMA SPARKED REGULATORY SOUL-SEARCH  The March 11 earthquake and tsunami overwhelmed the large Fukushima nuclear plant, and officials in Japan continue to grapple with cleaning up radioactive waste from the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 25 years.  The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission ordered its task force to examine the disaster for “lessons learned.” The NRC will now embark on a six-month broader review, and is expected to invite industry and the public to participate.  Many of the report’s recommendations dealt with shoring up back-up systems to kick in when plants lose all sources of power, as happened after the March 11 quake and tsunami in Japan overwhelmed the Fukushima plant.  The report recommended 11 orders — instructions for plants that the commission could implement quickly, if it agreed to do so.  One suggested order would see NRC inspectors renew checks to ensure plants live up to seismic standards, the report said.  It also included seven rule-makings, which tend to take at least two years to complete, and often much longer.  Part of the shift would bring voluntary industry guidelines about mitigating severe accidents under the regulator’s purview, which would require extensive rule-making.  Commissioners are slated to give their first public statements on the task force recommendations at a public hearing on July 19, while Chairman Gregory Jaczko — who is pushing for an expedited response — will speak publicly at a National Press Club event a day earlier.

15,EXC,Power companies see mixed economic picture,"NEW YORK/BANGALORE (Reuters) - Three top U.S. power companies posted higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday, but drew a mixed picture of the nation’s economic outlook and demand for electricity.  Exelon Corp (EXC.N), which operates the largest U.S. fleet of nuclear power plants, raised its full-year profit forecast based on results in the first half, when it relied on strong residential and small-business demand to offset weak electricity usage from industrial customers.

19,EXC,Third US nuclear official rejects quick overhaul," * Three of five NRC commissioners agree on slower approach  * Effectively kills Jaczko plan for rapid decisions  * Ostendorff-""significant reservations"" on shift in rules  By Roberta Rampton  WASHINGTON, July 28 (Reuters) - A third commissioner at the U.S. nuclear safety regulator has rejected a rapid overhaul of rules for U.S. plants in the wake of Japan's nuclear disaster advocated by the agency's chairman, voting instead for a slower approach.  The vote by William Ostendorff, a Republican on the five-member Nuclear Regulatory Commission, calls for more extensive reviews of U.S. nuclear rules and effectively puts an end to a plan pushed by Chairman Gregory Jaczko to respond to the Fukushima Daiichi disaster,  Ostendorff said he has ""significant reservations"" about proceeding with a key recommendation by a U.S. task force that reviewed the world's worst nuclear accident in 25 years to see whether there were lessons for the U.S. regulator.  ""This is perhaps one of the most important votes I will cast as a commissioner,"" Ostendorff wrote.  The task force called for a shift in the NRC's regime that would force big utility companies to plan for catastrophes far beyond what they were originally designed to withstand.  Any retrofits to the nation's fleet of 104 reactors that result from the review will add costs for operators such as Exelon (EXC.N), Entergy (ETR.N), and PG&E (PCG.N).  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   LINK-Ostendorff's vote        r.reuters.com/cup82s   FACTBOX-What's in the task force report?

""Such an effort would constitute a highly significant undertaking for the entire agency and realistically would take some number of years to accomplish,"" he said.  Ostendorff agreed with fellow commissioners William Magwood, a Democrat, and Kristine Svinicki, a Republican, who last week said they wanted NRC staff to develop a schedule within 45 days to evaluate the task force recommendations and gather input from the public and industry. [ID:nN1E76J0TL]  Ostendorff said the agency needs to ensure its regulations are ""not in an unjustifiable state of transition,"" but said there were some recommendations that could be implemented in the short term, such as re-evaluating the ability of plants to withstand earthquakes and floods.  JACZKO WANTED DECISIONS IN 90 DAYS  Jaczko, the NRC's chairman, had proposed that commissioners hold a series of public meetings and make decisions on the task force's ideas within 90 days, with a view to completing the changes within five years.  That would be an expedited timetable for a regulator that typically moves much more cautiously. [ID:nN1E76H148]  But in their written votes, the three commissioners said the task force found that there were not imminent safety risks at U.S. plants, meaning the NRC did not have to rush into changes.  Jaczko has not formally voted on the issue, but proposed a plan in a public speech earlier this month. The vote of the fourth commissioner, George Apostolakis, has not yet been posted on the NRC's website.  Once all commissioners have voted, the NRC's secretariat synthesizes their opinions into a consensus position contained in a ""staff requirements memorandum"" or SRM that gives NRC staff direction on the next steps to take.

Boxer asks tense commissioners  * Boxer urges quick action on “common sense” changes  * Will bring commissioners back for oversight in 90 days  * Republican senators: no rush for new nuclear regulations  * NRC’s Jaczko: commission is stuck on the process  By Roberta Rampton  WASHINGTON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - A senior Democratic senator chided the top officials at the U.S. nuclear safety regulator on Tuesday to try to get along as they work to make decisions on stepping up rules for nuclear plants in the wake of Japan’s Fukushima disaster.  Barbara Boxer told the five appointed members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that she expects them to get past their conflicts to make quick decisions on sweeping new regulations for the nation’s 104 nuclear reactors.  “I want all of you to know we’re going to have you back every 90 days until I know what you’re doing,” said Boxer, the California Democrat who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee, which has oversight of the NRC.  The Capitol Hill hearing was the latest public exposure of the fractious relationship between the agencies’ four commissioners and its chairman, Gregory Jaczko.  “How about a smile from everybody?” Boxer said after one of several uncomfortable moments at a hearing where the commissioners were pointedly asked to give yes-or-no answers to questions about Jaczko’s leadership and regulatory proposals.  “I’m sensing with you maybe there needs to be a little bit more friendship. I think it’s important that these differences not become personal,” Boxer told the five-member commission.  The commissioners have sparred over the thorny issue of nuclear waste storage, and in June the agency’s own independent watchdog described a toxic environment at the commission. [ID:nN10206422]  Now, the NRC is struggling with whether and how to proceed after an earthquake and tsunami in March overwhelmed the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan, the world’s worst nuclear accident in 25 years.  The ideas come from a task force of six senior NRC staff members. Last month, they called for a shift in the NRC’s regime that would force plants to plan for catastrophes beyond what they were originally designed to withstand, potentially adding millions in costs for operators like Exelon (EXC.N), Entergy (ETR.N), and PG&E (PCG.N).  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   FACTBOX-What’s in the task force report?

Democratic senators exhorted the four commissioners to move quickly on what they called “common sense” recommendations, and Boxer said it was “ridiculous” that the NRC took about 10 years to put in place changes after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.  But three of the four commissioners have voted to disagree with a plan advocated by Jaczko with what steps to take next. [ID:nN1E76R0IJ]  The chairman promoted his plan in a speech last month, but has not formally voted on how to proceed.  “All my colleagues have given us good things to think about about a way forward and I wanted to see what those would be,” Jaczko said when asked by reporters why he had not yet voted.  Until Jaczko has voted, the NRC’s secretariat cannot synthesize the opinions into a consensus position for a “staff requirements memorandum” stating the way forward.  “I think we’re kind of stuck at developing the process,” Jaczko told the Senate hearing.  The majority of commissioners want the NRC’s top operations staff to come up with recommendations for the logistics of dealing with the report — including how to involve industry and the public.  The commissioners have said some task force ideas could take longer than 90 days to evaluate. All of them downplayed the differences in their views.  “I think some of this discussion is really about semantics,” Jaczko said.  “MORE WASHINGTON RED TAPE”-BARRASSO  Republican senators noted the task force found there are no imminent nuclear safety issues in the United States.  “I am not surprised ... if you put six career regulators in a room for 90 days that you’re going to get a lot of suggestions for more Washington red tape,” said Wyoming Senator John Barrasso.  James Inhofe, the senior Republican on the Senate committee, said the NRC should not rush into new regulations.  “I don’t believe that an accident in a country with different regulatory systems and practices means that ours are broken,” Inhofe said.

Duke is currently seeking regulatory approvals for its planned $13.7 billion purchase of Progress Energy PGN.N, a deal that will create the nation’s largest utility owner.   Entergy said its finalized second-quarter profit was $315.6 million, or $1.76 per share, from $315.3 million, or $1.71 per share, the year-ago quarter.   That EPS figure was 1 cent higher than the preliminary earnings figure the company issued two weeks ago, and increased from the year-ago mark because of higher-than-expected share repurchases.   “The company ended the quarter with 177 (million) shares outstanding which is below its guidance of 180 (million) for the year,”  Marc de Croisset, analyst with FBR Capital Markets, said in a note to investors.

Emerging evidence shows that a tsunami like the one that overwhelmed the Fukushima Daiichi plant in March could happen once every 1,000 years or less, said George Apostolakis, one of three Democrats on the five-member Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  That kind of frequency would be unacceptable for U.S. plants not to be prepared for and it showed the plant was not adequately designed to protect against events that were within the realm of probability, Apostolakis said.  “This focus on the unthinkable is really misplaced. It was not unthinkable at all,” Apostolakis said in a speech at the Bipartisan Policy Center.  He said not enough people have yet acknowledged the issue that the plant should been better secured. “This is the kind of secret that everybody knows but nobody wants to say anything about.”  The U.S. regulator should now reconfirm that the country’s fleet of 104 nuclear reactors owned by some of the country’s biggest utilities are designed to withstand disasters within historical probabilities. But the NRC would have had a much bigger task if Fukushima’s disaster truly was “unthinkable,” Apostolakis said.  “If it was really unthinkable, there would be great urgency, it seems to me, to really try to think about these kind of unlikely events and how we can protect the plants,” he said.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   FACTBOX-What’s in the task force report?

U.S. utilities have been hit hard in the last two years because of lower natural gas prices and weak economic conditions.	   The sustained decline in natural gas prices — which tend to set rates for electricity — have resulted in lower margins for companies whose plants operate on nuclear and coal fuel. Profit expectations, accordingly, have been diluted.	   PSEG stood by its full-year operating earnings outlook of $2.50-$2.75 a share, compared with $3.12 it earned last year.	   Constellation, which has agreed to be bought by Exelon Corp  , lowered its 2011 earnings forecast by 5 cents to $3.05-$3.35, largely on longer-than-anticipated outages at its nuclear joint venture facilities.	   Constellation CEO Mayo Shattuck III said: “The merger (with Exelon) will provide us with a diverse and adaptable platform on which to grow market share and deliver strong results.”	   PSEG too sounded a desire to expand by raising its 2011-2013 capital investment program by nearly 3 percent to $6.9 billion.	   “Supportive regulation at the state and federal level has been a foundation of our investments,” CEO Ralph Izzo said.	   Constellation reported an adjusted profit of 76 cents a share for April-June. Analysts had projected 86 cents per share excluding special items, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  	   PSEG’s second-quarter operating income fell 6 percent to $301 million, or 59 cents a share, beating estimates of 55 cents a share. 	   Smaller rival El Paso Electric Co’s second-quarter net income rose 53 percent to $33 million, or 78 cents a share, easily topping Wall Street view of 63 cents. 	   “The increase in earnings was primarily driven by hotter than normal weather and the new seasonal rates in Texas, which were effective July 1, 2010,” El Paso CEO David Stevens said.	   As a result, El Paso raised the lower end of its prior full-year earnings outlook by 10 cents to $2.20-$2.50 a share.

28,EXC,U.S. inspecting Virginia nuclear reactor after quake,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Dominion Resources workers were inspecting the North Anna nuclear power plant in Mineral, Virginia on Wednesday, a day after an earthquake centered near plant knocked both reactors offline, the company said.  The company said several aftershocks were felt but had no impact on the plant, 80 miles southwest of Washington, which canceled its emergency alert on Wednesday afternoon.  “There will be an extensive walk-down, including inside the containment (vessel) once both units are in cold-shutdown,” said Joey Ledford, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s regional office in Atlanta.  “They will go over this with a fine-tooth comb, with our resident inspectors beside them, to make sure there is no damage of any kind,” Ledford said.  Tuesday’s 5.8 magnitude earthquake, the largest to hit the U.S. East Coast in 67 years, knocked out power to the nuclear plant which triggered an automatic shutdown.  Operators restarted coolant pumps for each reactor after off-site power was restored overnight.  NRC officials will assess damage, and also seismic data from the site to determine if the quake was stronger than the plant was designed to withstand.  That will be critical in determining how long the 1,806-megawatt station will remain shut, officials said.  “In light of the quake’s strength and proximity to the plant, the NRC will soon decide whether to conduct a follow-up inspection, aimed at determining how the quake compares to what the plant was designed to withstand,” the NRC said in a statement.  Seismic equipment that measured the tremor at the North Anna Station has been sent for a complete evaluation expected to take a few days, according to the NRC.  The agency has not decided whether to send a special team of inspectors to the plant, according to a release.  Dominion officials were not available to discuss seismic data. Spokesman Jim Norvelle had said the North Anna reactors, which entered service in 1978 and 1980, were designed to withstand an earthquake of up to 6.2 in magnitude.  Dominion reported no “major” damage to the facility on Tuesday as diesel generators were started to keep the reactors’ radioactive cores cool until off-site power was restored in a few hours.  North Anna is unlikely to be affected by the approach of Hurricane Irene as it moves up the East Coast, NRC officials said.  Other nuclear stations, however, including Dominion’s Surry plant in Virginia and Progress Energy’s Brunswick Station on the North Carolina coast, are preparing for the storm, NRC officials said.  Owners of 12 other nuclear power plants that also felt Tuesday’s quake, including Exelon Corp, Public Service Enterprise Group, American Electric Power Co,  Constellation Energy, PPL Corp; Entergy Corp and Progress Energy have canceled emergency event warnings after inspections for quake-related damage.  These plants were: Peach Bottom, Three Mile Island, Susquehanna and Limerick in Pennsylvania; Salem, Hope Creek and Oyster Creek in New Jersey, Calvert Cliffs in Maryland, Surry in Virginia, Shearon Harris in North Carolina and D.C.

32,EXC,FACTBOX-US nuclear facilities look to restart after Irene," Aug 28 (Reuters) - Entergy Corp (ETR.N) officials said operations at the company’s three nuclear plants were unaffected as Hurricane Irene trampled New York, Massachusetts and Vermont on Sunday.  In North Carolina, Progress Energy PGN.N planned to boost output at its Brunswick nuclear station in the next 24 to 36 hours. The two Brunswick units were reduced to about 70 percent output on Saturday in advance of Irene making landfall slightly north of the plant on the Outer Banks. [ID:nWEN7661]  Operators found no damage at Exelon Corp’s (EXC.N) Oyster Creek nuclear power plant site in New Jersey, a spokesman said Sunday. Exelon took the unit offline ahead of Irene on Saturday as a precaution. [ID:nWEN7647]  “We will work with federal and state agencies to return Oyster Creek to service at the appropriate time,” an Exelon spokesman said.  In Maryland, Constellation Energy Nuclear Group employees were inspecting a transformer at Unit 1 of the Calvert Cliffs facility on Sunday. Unit 1 shut safely after the transformer was hit by a section of aluminum siding during the storm. Unit 2 remained in operation.  Unit 1 never lost off-site power, a spokesman said.  “Nuclear energy facilities in the path of Hurricane Irene have responded well and responded safely to this storm,” said Scott Peterson of the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry’s trade group.  Dominion Resources Inc (D.N) reduced power at its two-unit 2,111-megawatt Millstone plant in Connecticut ahead of the storm, a company spokesman said.

The hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm with 60-miles-per-hour winds as it made landfall in New York, sparing the largest U.S. city the widespread power outages forecast by many.  Still, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) warned it could take several days to restore power to areas experiencing blackouts on the East Coast.  New Jersey utility Public Service Electric and Gas (PSE&G) said 330,000 customers could be without power for five to seven days. FEMA said the duration of outages on the East Coast would depend on whether systems were damaged by the storm or taken offline protectively.  New York City utility Consolidated Edison said on Sunday it had made no final decision on whether to cut power to lower Manhattan due to storm surges, but flooding in the area appeared less severe than feared.  Several East Coast oil refineries throttled back operations and ConocoPhillips shut its Bayway plant in New Jersey.  Conoco said Bayway remained shut on Sunday morning though its Trainer, Pennsylvania refinery continued to operate. No damage was reported at any plant on the East Coast as of 11:51 a.m.  PBF Energy said its New Jersey and Delaware refineries sustained no damage from the storm and were operating normally as of Sunday morning.  Two nuclear power plants were forced to shut during the storm, but Progress Energy said the units at its Brunswick plant in North Carolina should be back to full power within 36 hours.  A unit at Constellation Energy’s Calvert Cliff plant in Maryland remained offline after an aluminum siding flew off a building and hit a transformer, forcing a precautionary shutdown on Saturday night. The firm said the reactor was safe and a second unit was running at full power.  As a precaution against winds, Exelon Corp took its Oyster Creek nuclear power plant in New Jersey offline on Saturday. The plant normally supplies electricity to as many as 600,000 homes.  The oil hub of New York Harbor is expected to resume normal operations on Monday, the U.S. Coast Guard said, after imposing severe traffic restrictions as the storm bared down. Traffic restrictions will remain in place on Sunday.  Irene tracked north toward New England after landing only a glancing blow on New York City.  Just over 110,000 homes and businesses in the city’s five boroughs and neighboring Westchester County were without power at 11:51 a.m. EDT, Con Edison said, less than 4 percent of the total the company powers in the region.  Con Edison estimated most would have power restored by 10:00 a.m. EDT on Monday.  The largest blackouts took place in Virginia, where almost 40 percent of households and businesses were without power, Dominion Resources said.  Dominion said its damage assessment would be completed by noon on Monday.  “We ask for your patience while we complete this important restoration step because it allows us to identify the extent of damage, prioritize restoration so we can restore power to the greatest number of customers in the shortest amount of time, and accurately predict when we will complete restoration,” the company said on its website.

The category 1 storm made landfall in New Jersey before dawn with 75 mile-per-hour/120 kph winds, dumping heavy rain and provoking storm surges. The hurricane was 40 miles southwest of New York City at 8:00 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT), the National Hurricane Center said.   Mid-Atlantic coast states reported more power losses even as blackouts in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut jumped. In New York City and nearby Westchester County, some 80,000 customers lost electricity.   Consolidated Edison (ED.N), which powers nearly 3 million homes and businesses — or more than 8 million residents — in the city warned that flooding could prompt much wider power cuts in downtown Manhattan.   Two East Coast nuclear power plants shut to ensure safety. Aluminum siding flew off a building in Maryland and slammed into a transformer at CENG’s Calvert Cliff reactor early Sunday, forcing it to shut and declare an “unusual event,” the lowest level of nuclear emergency. CENG said the reactor was safe and secure.   As a precaution against winds, Exelon Corp (EXC.N) took its Oyster Creek nuclear power plant in New Jersey offline on Saturday. The plant normally supplies electricity to as many as 600,000 homes. [ID:nWEN7647]   Several East Coast oil refineries throttled back operations and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) shut its Bayway plant in New Jersey.   With gale-force winds and rough seas threatening shipping, the oil hubs of New York Harbor and the Port of Philadelphia declared alert level ""Zulu,"" an emergency designation that severely restricts vessel traffic, the U.S. Coast Guard said.

36,EXC,Irene cuts power to 1.8 million,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene knocked out power to 1.8 million homes and businesses, disrupted oil refineries and forced nuclear plants to reduce power as it barreled toward New York City.  As the Southeast made small progress toward restoring power as Irene spun northward, blackouts in Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey jumped.  Only 19,000 customers faced outages in New York City, but Consolidated Edison warned that downtown Manhattan, including Wall Street, could face further blackouts as low lying areas flooded.  Local forecasters said the path of Irene was shifting westward, raising the prospect of 10-foot storm surges.  Several East Coast refineries were forced to cut back on runs, while ConocoPhillips shut its Bayway plant in New Jersey. Other refiners in Pennsylvania and New Jersey throttled back on throughput or prepared for the full impact of the storm.  The U.S. Coast Guard closed the Port of Philadelphia, an oil hub, and restricted some vessel traffic at the larger hub of New York Harbor, which stayed open.  Power generator Exelon idled the Oyster Creek nuclear power plant in Ocean County, New Jersey, as a precaution. The plant supplies up to 600,000 homes.  The shutdown is expected to be short and other power supply may be available in the region, a company spokesman said.  “It’s really as a precaution, a conservative action because we do expect hurricane force winds,” said Exelon spokesman Marshall Murphy on Saturday.

U.S. stock exchanges were expecting to operate normally on Monday. [ID:nN1E77Q0CP]   Irene cut power to large swaths of Virginia and North Carolina and forced the Brunswick nuclear power plant in Southport, North Carolina to reduce power generation.   Brunswick sustained no damage, but electricity from its two nuclear reactors was cut by 25 to 35 percent, to ensure they can keep running through the storm, said operator Progress Energy PGN.N.   Progress said 228,000 customers were without power in North Carolina as of 7:33 p.m. EDT (2333 GMT). Dominion Resources (D.N) said around 822,000 of its customers lost power in North Carolina and Virginia. Outages also hit areas in Maryland and Delaware.   In New York City, which was bracing for Irene’s impact late on Saturday into Sunday, intermittent rains began in the afternoon but the power grid suffered few disruptions so far.   That could change as storm surges cause flooding.   “Make sure you know where your flashlights are,” Mayor Michael Bloomberg warned New Yorkers at a storm briefing on Saturday.   Utility Consolidated Edison (ED.N) said it wouldn’t shut down the city’s power pre-emptively, but could cut power early on Sunday in low-lying parts of Manhattan, including to 6,000 homes or businesses south of the Brooklyn Bridge. The area includes New York’s Financial District.   Irene howled ashore in North Carolina on Saturday, weakening to a Category 1 hurricane, and was expected to hit the mid-Atlantic states on Saturday night and New England on Sunday. [ID:nN1E77Q00G]   At least one oil refinery shut and others scaled back in the Northeast, home to 1.2 million barrel per day of capacity.   ConocoPhillips said late Saturday it had shut the 238,000 barrel per day Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey to gird against Irene. Sources said the oil major also cut rates at its 185,000 Trainer, Pennsylvania, refinery.    On Friday, rates were cut by 25 percent at Sunoco’s (SUN.N) Marcus Hook plant in Pennsylvania, sources said. The firm declined comment on operations Saturday.   The U.S. Coast Guard closed the Port of Philadelphia, a major oil hub which typically handles 1 million barrels a day. At 4:00 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT) it said gale force winds were expected at the port within 12 hours. [ID:nN1E77Q0CE]   The New York Harbor, a delivery hub for crude oil and fuels by pipeline, barge and ship, remained open on Saturday with traffic restrictions, including a ban on anchoring of vessels.   The largest U.S. refined oil product pipeline, the 2.37 million barrel a day Colonial that runs from the Gulf Coast to New York, continued operating after warning earlier of potential disruptions to customers along its path. Several coastal oil terminals were forced to shut.   Shipping disruptions may delay oil deliveries to the East Coast, or PADD 1, but the region’s plentiful oil inventories lessen the risk of major supply shortages.   Trade group National Petrochemical and Refiners Association said on Friday the region’s oil terminals held 23 days of gasoline supply and 46 days supply of diesel and heating oil. [ID:nN1E77P1BG]   Around nine days of crude supply were held in the region’s terminals, according to Energy Department data from last week.

40,EXC,"Energy operations resume after Irene, 5 million lose power","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Energy firms along the Eastern Seaboard scrambled on Monday to resume operations after Hurricane Irene left millions of customers without power.  Refineries and other energy facilities escaped serious damage, while utilities, whose power lines were battered by the storm over the weekend, faced the most daunting workload, with over 5 million homes and businesses from North Carolina to Maine still cut off on Monday.  Restoring power could take days, and up to weeks in the hardest-hit zones, due to flooding and strewn debris.  “Irene was weaker than some expected, but it will probably take a week to restore power to some areas,” said energy analyst Peter Beutel of Cameron Hanover in Connecticut.  “The storm shouldn’t have a permanent impact on energy infrastructure.”  One of the hardest hit refiner was Sunoco, which shut a crude unit at its Philadelphia refinery after a pump was flooded, sources said. The company was boosting output at another Pennsylvania plant, Marcus Hook.  ConocoPhillips’ 238,000 barrel per day (bpd) Bayway oil refinery in Linden, New Jersey also shut down on Saturday but was due to restart on Monday, a source familiar with the plant said.  Other East Coast refineries that throttled back for Irene were resuming normal operations, and wholesale gasoline prices fell by 1 percent on Monday at the New York Harbor, after the oil hub reopened to vessel traffic following the storm.  One nuclear power reactor at Constellation Energy’s Calvert Cliffs facility in Maryland remained shut after being struck by wind-blown debris on Sunday, but the company said the plant was safe. Other plants that reduced operations were preparing to restore normal rates, while Exelon Corp’s Oyster Creek New Jersey plant, which supplies up to 600,000 homes, remained offline.  POWER GRIDS HARDEST-HIT  As of 3:00 p.m. Monday (1900 GMT), power was restored to one in every six households and business affected by outages from Irene, the Department of Energy said.  That left 5.1 million customers without power in 14 U.S. states, down from the 6.7 million affected in all by the storm, the department said in a report.  New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Virginia — where the outages were greatest in number — all had more than 600,000 customers without power on Monday afternoon.  In Rhode Island around two-thirds of all customers had no power, or more than 280,000, the DOE said.  In New York State, 889,000 customers were still without power late Monday.  Consolidated Edison, which powers New York City and nearby Westchester County, said around 70,000 remained affected in those areas. It expected to restore city customers by late Tuesday and others by Thursday.  Utilities warned that work could be slow-going.  “There are still areas we can’t get to because of flooding and debris,” said Jersey Central spokesman Ron Morano, who estimated that restoring service would take several days.

[ID:nN1E77S0X2]   New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Virginia — where the outages were greatest in number — all had more than 600,000 customers without power on Monday.   In Rhode Island, where the largest portion of users was affected, around two-thirds of the customers had no power, or nearly 275,000, the DOE said.   In New York State, where 939,000 customers were down on Monday, electric companies had managed to restore electricity to only 4,000 users overnight, the DOE figures showed.   Consolidated Edison (ED.N), which powers New York City and nearby Westchester County, said nearly 100,000 remained affected in those areas. It expected to restore city customers by late Tuesday and others by Thursday.   Utilities warned that work could be slow-going.   “There are still areas we can’t get to because of flooding and debris,” said Jersey Central spokesman Ron Morano, who estimated that restoring service would take several days. Around a third of the firm’s 1.1 million customers in central and northern New Jersey were affected on Monday.    The New York Harbor, a shipping hub for millions of barrels a day in crude oil and refined products, said it expected to resume normal activities on Monday after Irene’s approach forced the port to restrict vessel traffic. The Port of Philadelphia, which serves nearby refineries, also re-opened.   The 2.37 million bpd Colonial pipeline system, which ships refined oil products from the Gulf Coast to New York, said on Monday it was nearly ready to resume normal operations. The storm cut power to some oil terminals supplied by the pipeline. [ID:nN1E77S0W1]   Kinder Morgan’s 600,000 bpd Plantation pipeline from North Carolina to Washington D.C. resumed normal operations on Monday after a brief shutdown during the storm.

43,EXC,Factbox: About 2.8 million customers still without power,"(Reuters) - Power was restored on Tuesday to a majority of the homes and businesses along the U.S. Eastern Seaboard that were hit by Tropical Storm Irene, leaving about 2.8 million without electricity.  The U.S. Department of Energy reported that 2.8 million customers were without power as of 1:00 p.m. (1700 GMT) Tuesday, down from 3.3 million on Tuesday morning, and down from a peak of 6.7 million after the storm hit at the weekend.  The most outages were still in New York state, where about 525,400 customers - down from 939,000 on Monday morning - were affected.  Utility companies said it could still take days to restore electricity in accessible areas and weeks in hardest-hit regions.  Reports from utility firms and tallied by Reuters identified at least 2.1 million users without power at 4:00 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT), but that estimate does not take into account all utilities.  Con Edison said it planned to restore power to all affected New York city customers by late Tuesday night while power may not be fully restored in Westchester county earlier than Thursday night because of the damage Irene caused on local infrastructure.  “Irene took her toll on the trees and the trees took their toll on the power lines,” said Chris Olert, a spokesman for Con Edison.

Connecticut had the biggest percentage of users affected, with one-third of the state’s customers without power, the DOE said.  The United Illuminating company reported widespread damage to infrastructure in Connecticut, the government said in its twice-daily report.

45,EXC,"Energy operations resume after Irene, 5 million lose power","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Energy firms along the Eastern Seaboard scrambled on Monday to resume operations after Hurricane Irene left millions of customers without power.  Refineries and other energy facilities escaped serious damage, while utilities, whose power lines were battered by the storm over the weekend, faced the most daunting workload, with over 5 million homes and businesses from North Carolina to Maine still cut off on Monday.  Restoring power could take days, and up to weeks in the hardest-hit zones, due to flooding and strewn debris.  “Irene was weaker than some expected, but it will probably take a week to restore power to some areas,” said energy analyst Peter Beutel of Cameron Hanover in Connecticut.  “The storm shouldn’t have a permanent impact on energy infrastructure.”  One of the hardest hit refiner was Sunoco, which shut a crude unit at its Philadelphia refinery after a pump was flooded, sources said. The company was boosting output at another Pennsylvania plant, Marcus Hook.  ConocoPhillips’ 238,000 barrel per day (bpd) Bayway oil refinery in Linden, New Jersey also shut down on Saturday but was due to restart on Monday, a source familiar with the plant said.  Other East Coast refineries that throttled back for Irene were resuming normal operations, and wholesale gasoline prices fell by 1 percent on Monday at the New York Harbor, after the oil hub reopened to vessel traffic following the storm.  One nuclear power reactor at Constellation Energy’s Calvert Cliffs facility in Maryland remained shut after being struck by wind-blown debris on Sunday, but the company said the plant was safe. Other plants that reduced operations were preparing to restore normal rates, while Exelon Corp’s Oyster Creek New Jersey plant, which supplies up to 600,000 homes, remained offline.  POWER GRIDS HARDEST-HIT  As of 3:00 p.m. Monday (1900 GMT), power was restored to one in every six households and business affected by outages from Irene, the Department of Energy said.  That left 5.1 million customers without power in 14 U.S. states, down from the 6.7 million affected in all by the storm, the department said in a report.  New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Virginia — where the outages were greatest in number — all had more than 600,000 customers without power on Monday afternoon.  In Rhode Island around two-thirds of all customers had no power, or more than 280,000, the DOE said.  In New York State, 889,000 customers were still without power late Monday.  Consolidated Edison, which powers New York City and nearby Westchester County, said around 70,000 remained affected in those areas.

46,EXC,UPDATE 3-Quake-hit US plant sees restart without retrofits," * Virginia plant near epicenter shut down after quake  * No required modifications expected to prevent restart  * But eventual changes expected in broader review-expert  * Cosmetic damage found in containment structure at plant  (Adds comments from Dominion, detail, link to factbox on US quake risk, paragraphs 10-15)  By Ayesha Rascoe and Roberta Rampton  MINERAL, Va., Sept 2 (Reuters) - After a week of detailed inspections, Dominion Resources Inc (D.N) has not yet found any severe damage that would prevent its quake-hit North Anna plant from restarting, a senior official said on Friday.  Dominion does not expect to have to do any major retrofits before resuming operations at its plant, only miles from the epicenter of last week’s record earthquake in the Eastern United States, said Dan Stoddard, the company’s senior vice president for nuclear operations.  The force of the brief earthquake may have gone beyond the design specifications for the two reactors — the first time that has happened for an operating U.S. nuclear power plant.  Despite the lack of damage, the Virginia quake comes at a sensitive juncture for the U.S. nuclear sector.  A nuclear disaster in Japan that followed an earthquake and tsunami in March prompted a major regulatory review in the United States. Operators such as Dominion, Exelon (EXC.N), Entergy (ETR.N) and PG&E (PCG.N) have been assessing costs of fixes to aging plants.  This week, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced it wants the country’s 104 reactors to model earthquake risks using updated data, the latest step in a decades-long process that hasn’t uncovered any “imminent” dangers but could eventually result in expensive “backfits” for plants.  “I think what the East Coast earthquake demonstrated is the design parameters might be changing,” said Dale Klein, a mechanical engineer at the University of Texas, and a former chairman at the NRC.  “This is probably going to be plant-by-plant, and they’ll probably say, ‘These are the requirements you now have to meet,’” Klein said in an interview.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   FACTBOX-U.S. nuclear plant quake risk     [ID:nN1E77T21G]   INTERVIEW-Jaczko after the quake          [ID:nN1E780230]   Virginia quake shakes nuclear plant       [ID:nN1E77S184]   FACTBOX-Post-Fukushima review of US plants   [nN1E76C176]   NEWSMAKER-Jaczko meshes physics, politics    [nN06200024]   TAKE A LOOK-U.S. maps out nuclear reforms   [ID:nNUKEUSA]  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>  VIRGINIA PLANT EXPECTS RESTART  Reporters stepped over cracked floor tiles in the North Anna plant’s administrative building during a tour of the plant on Friday, an example of the minor damage seen from the quake that Dominion official Stoddard said speaks to the extra engineering “safety margins” built into the plant.  The most severe damage was to seals at the base of high-voltage “porcelain bushings” that connect the plant’s transformer to the power grid, and Dominion has already begun replacing the damaged equipment.  Preliminary reviews indicated that while the ground may have shaken more than the plant was designed to handle at points during the earthquake, the strongest ground motions only lasted a few seconds.  “One acceleration for very short time over design (specifications) does nothing to plant and that’s consistent with what we’ve seen,” Stoddard said.  “That tells me that earthquake was non-damaging ... and that we have significant margin over and above the design of the plant,” he added.  While the company stressed that the quake had done little harm to the plant, officials declined to provide any specific measurements of ground acceleration at the plant during the historic tremor, saying the company’s analysis is not yet complete.  Workers at the plant did find at small crack in an interior wall within a containment structure at the plant. Officials described it as “cosmetic” damage, however.  The company will complete its analysis of the quake’s impact next week, but does not yet have a timeline for when it will resume producing power — something that will require sign-off from the regulator.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is also inspecting the plant and its review is expected to take a few weeks.  NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko told Reuters on Thursday that the regulator has not yet seen any sign of equipment damaged in the quake, but he said it was too soon to say what changes the regulator might require. [ID:nN1E780230]  There’s nothing so far to suggest that the regulator would move to permanently shut down the plant, said Nathan Ives, an industry consultant with Ernst & Young.  “I’d expect North Anna to be fully inspected and rigorously inspected, but then to be back online, operating at capacity,” said Ives, who formerly worked with the Institute of Nuclear Power Operation, the industry’s self-regulatory body.

48,EXC,Pennsylvania nuclear plants operate despite floods,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - All three nuclear power plants in Pennsylvania along the Susquehanna River continued to operate at high power, plant operators said on Friday, after the river had flooded several towns in New York and Pennsylvania.  The Susquehanna River, swollen by rainfall from the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee, reached record levels in Pennsylvania and submerged some towns amid worry that flood waters had been turned toxic by swamped sewage processing plants.  The nuclear operators, PPL and Exelon, said they were monitoring the river and had prepared their sites for possible flooding but did not expect high water levels to affect operations of the reactors.  PPL, which operates the 2,289-megawatt (MW) Susquehanna nuclear plant in Luzerne County about 130 miles northwest of Philadelphia, said the water had crested and was dropping by the Susquehanna plant.  Both units at Susquehanna continued to operate at full power early Friday.  Exelon, which operates one 786-MW reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant near the state capital of Harrisburg and two reactors at the 2,224-MW Peach Bottom plant, said the water was already at its high point near Three Mile Island and would likely crest at Peach Bottom overnight Friday.  Three Mile Island is about 100 miles west of Philadelphia, while Peach Bottom is further down the Susquehanna River about 80 miles west of Philadelphia.  Three Mile Island Unit 1 and Peach Bottom 2 were operating at full power, while Peach Bottom 3 was running at 87 percent power Friday morning as it coasts down for a planed refueling outage this autumn.  Peach Bottom 3 could shut for refueling as early as this weekend, according to Reuters data.

50,EXC,US seeking nuclear safety experts after Fukushima," * Industry, regulator seek expertise to carry out changes  * Bandwidth issues will help determine timetable for NRC  * “More important to do it right than to do it fast”-NRC  * Critics tell NRC to get on with the job  * NRC should require plants to update quake sensors-USGS  By Roberta Rampton  WASHINGTON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. nuclear regulator and the power plants it oversees will be challenged to find enough seismic experts and staff to carry out changes to safety ordered in the wake of Japan’s Fukushima nuclear disaster, top industry and regulatory officials said on Wednesday.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, working on tougher requirements for plants to withstand earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters, is set to vote later this year operators on how to carry out the first set.  The NRC has said there was no “imminent risk” to U.S. nuclear plant safety, but it wants to make improvements after an earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March caused the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 25 years.  Next month, senior staff will propose a timetable for the first tasks, some of which will take at least two years to complete. Eventually, plants must reevaluate risks of earthquakes and floods.  In some cases, the NRC needs to ask the 104 U.S. nuclear reactor operators for detailed information to help determine criteria for changes, said Bill Borchardt, the NRC’s executive director for operations.  “It’s more important to do it right than to do it fast,” Borchardt told the agency’s five commissioners at a hearing.  Critics urged the NRC to move more decisively.  “You ought to be able to tell them what needs to be done and expect them to do it,” said Thomas Cochran of the Natural Resources Defense Council.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  US regulator’s to-do list after Fukushima  [ID:nN1E77U0F5]  FACTBOX-US nuclear plant quake risk        [ID:nN1E77T21G]  FACTBOX-Post-Fukushima review of US plants    [nN1E76C176]  FACTBOX-US reactors similar to Fukushima   [ID:nN1E76C139]  TAKE A LOOK-U.S. maps out nuclear reforms    [ID:nNUKEUSA]  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>  LIMITED BANDWIDTH  The timetable is important, since the activities will stretch industry and regulatory staff, said Eric Leeds, director of the NRC’s Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.  For example, Constellation Energy CEG.N is overhauling a backup water system at a nuclear power plant — a major project — on a voluntary basis, Leeds said.  “I applaud it as a regulator, I want them to do that work. I’m very loathe to put something else on their plate that might deter them from doing that, that might not have the same safety impact,” Leeds explained.  The industry agrees with many NRC proposals, but is nervous about finding enough outside experts who can do complex risk analyses, said Charles Pardee, chief operating officer of Exelon’s (EXC.N) nuclear group and chairman of an industry group responding to the Fukushima disaster.  “There are very limited resources for experts in seismic hazard analysis,” Pardee said.  MODERN SEISMIC MONITORS URGED  The NRC should require plants to upgrade earthquake monitoring equipment, said William Leith, earthquake hazards coordinator with the U.S. Geological Survey.  “Modern digital instrumentation is reliable and relatively inexpensive,” Leith said. He said the instruments could have helped last month when a record earthquake in the eastern United States shook the Virginia plant owned by Dominion Resources (D.N) beyond what it was designed to withstand. [ID:nN1E7870JL]  “Having an accurate independent source would be to the benefit of the NRC in trying to determine what actions should be taken following a significant ground-shaking earthquake,” Leith told commissioners.

51,EXC,GE calls for shut-down tests on reactors worldwide," * GE says problem could occur under limited conditions   * NRC says problem not an “immediate” safety issue   * Boiling-water design similar to GE reactors at Fukushima   By Jim Brumm   WILMINGTON, NC Sept 30 (Reuters) - GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy has warned operators of boiling water reactors (BWR) worldwide — including 35 in the U.S. — that the plants could fail to shut automatically during an earthquake, potentially risking the safety of the power plant.   In an event notification posted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission this week, GE Hitachi told nuclear operators to conduct tests to determine what conditions would prevent the reactors from shutting safely during an earth quake.   GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy is a venture between General Electric Co (GE.N) and Hitachi Limited (6501.T).   GE Hitachi spokesman Michael Tetuan said most nuclear plants could fix the problem by replacing fuel channels, if needed. A typical boiling water reactor has between 400 and 800 such channels.   The affected plants are of the same GE design as Japan’s Fukushima reactors which were crippled by an earthquake and tsunami in March.   GE said the probability of a reactor not shutting properly is very low. Because of the limited circumstances under which a unit might not shut automatically, NRC spokesman Scott Burnell said the issue “is not an immediate safety issue.”   He said GE’s notice is information the agency wants nuclear vendors to raise so that companies can respond.   Affected by the potential glitch are type 2-5 BWRs designed by General Electric and built between the late 1960s and the early 1990s.   In the U.S., 12 of those nuclear units are owned by Exelon Corp (EXC.N); five by Entergy Corp (ETR.N); and three by the Tennessee Valley Authority.   Other affected plants are owned by Constellation Energy Group CEG.N, Progress Energy PGN.N, Southern Co (SO.N), NextEra Energy (NEE.N), DTE Energy (DTE.N), Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG.N), PPL Inc (PPL.N), Xcel Energy XEL.N, Energy Northwest and the Nebraska Public Power District.   GE Hitachi identified the problem in July 2010 and reported to the NRC last September, months before an earthquake-spawned tsunami crippled GE reactors in Japan.   U.S. reactors included are Nine Mile Point Units 1 and 2; Fermi 2; Columbia; FitzPatrick; Pilgrim; Vermont Yankee; Grand Gulf; River Bend; Clinton; Oyster Creek; Dresden 2 and 3; LaSalle 1 and 2; Limerick 1 and 2; Peach Bottom 2 and 3; Quad Cities 1 and 2; Perry; Duane Arnold; Cooper; Monticello; Brunswick 1 and 2; Hope Creek; Hatch 1 and 2; and Browns Ferry 1, 2 and 3.   “We’ve proactively identified a very unique set of conditions in which a plant rarely operates where this is a concern,” Tetuan said. “With the guidance provided to our customers, they will be able to monitor potentially affected fuel channels and avoid a safety concern.”   Tetuan said the company also notified operators of BWRs located elsewhere.

52,EXC,UPDATE 2-US doles out last of loan aid to solar projects," * Renewable energy loan program ends Friday  * More than $4 billion in aid doled out on last day  * Loan aid “solidifies” First Solar’s prospects-analyst  (Recasts, adds details about other projects, analyst comment)  By Ayesha Rascoe  WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Friday approved more than $4.7 billion in loan guarantees for major solar projects as the government closed out an incentive program embroiled in controversy over the bankruptcy of one of its biggest projects.  With the program’s statutory deadline approaching, the government finalized deals with First Solar (FSLR.O), SunPower Corp SPWRA.O, and Prologis Inc (PLD.N).  The government’s clean energy program has been at the center of a political firestorm since the high-profile collapse of Solyndra, a solar panel manufacturer that was the first company to receive backing from the program.  Still, the projects that received loan guarantees Friday differ from the Solyndra deal, which relied on the company’s ability to sell panels manufactured after its plant was completed.  Instead, both First Solar and SunPower received guarantees to build solar power plants, which need contracts to supply electricity to utilities for financing and therefore have a fixed revenue stream.  The government closed a deal to partially back $1.46 billion in loans for First Solar’s massive Desert Sunlight plant in Riverside County, California.  Once completed, the 550 megawatt plant, which could power more than 110,000 homes, will be one of the largest solar plants in the world.  First Solar also closed a deal for $646 million in backing for its 230 megawatt Antelope Valley solar plant, while SunPower received a $1.2 billion guarantee for its 250 megawatt California Valley Ranch plant.  With loan guarantees in hand, all three of the plants have already been sold.  First Solar said Exelon (EXC.N) bought the Antelope project. NextEra Energy, Inc (NEE.N) and GE (GE.N) Energy Financial Services have acquired the Desert Sunlight plant.  NRG Energy (NRG.N) has purchased the California Valley project, SunPower said Friday.  ‘BRUTAL’ PROCESS  The completion of the loan guarantees for industry stalwart First Solar will remove some uncertainty for investors in the aftermath of Solyndra’s bankruptcy.  “The difference is that First Solar’s is proven technology, Solyndra’s was not,” said Mark Bachman, an analyst at Auriga USA. “This solidifies the longer-term prospects; it would have been a huge negative if the government had not done this today,” Bachman said.  The FBI has been probing the collapse of Solyndra and Repbulicans have launched an investigation as they step up criticism of the Obama Administration’s handling of the program.  Republicans have complained that the department may be rushing to complete deals to meet the program’s deadline.  The department has strongly disputed these claims, saying any deal that is completed will be “fully vetted” following months of intense review.  Energy bankers and financiers have also said the department’s process to qualify for the loan guarantees was far more onerous and detailed than required by private banks.  “For the ones that went through the whole process, it’s been brutal,” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James. “The fact that there are still loan guarantees being finalized shows that Washington is not completely dysfunctional,” Molchanov said.  In addition to the SunPower and First Solar guarantees, the department finalized a partial guarantee for a $1.4 billion loan to support a project installing solar panels on industrial buildings. The project is owned by Prologis and backed by NRG Energy Inc.

53,EXC,Exelon-Constellation merger gets PJM monitor OK,"* Exelon agreed to buy Constellation for $7.9 bln in April * Merged company to divest three Constellation plants NEW YORK, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Exelon and Constellation Energy on Tuesday moved their planned merger another step forward following a settlement with the PJM grid operator’s market monitor that includes the divestiture of three power plants in Maryland. The market monitor, Joseph Bowring of Monitoring Analytics, said, “The market monitor has engaged in discussions with the Applicants (Constellation and Exelon) regarding various structural and behavioral remedies that, when combined with the asset divestiture proposal ... would satisfy the market monitor’s concerns regarding the merger.” Chicago-based Exelon agreed to buy Baltimore-based Constellation for $7.9 billion in April. The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) must also approve of the merger. Bowring said in a letter to FERC and the Maryland PSC that the PJM market monitor would not object to the merger so long as it contains the terms of conditions contained in this settlement. As previously announced, Exelon and Constellation agreed to divest three of Constellation’s power plants in Maryland - the 1,286-megawatt Brandon Shores coal-fired plant, the 399-MW CP Crane coal/oil-fired plant and the 996-MW HA Wagner coal/gas/oil-fired plant. The settlement prohibits the sale of the power plants to several already large generators in the region, including American Electric Power , FirstEnergy , GenOn , Edison International , Dominion , Public Service Enterprise , Calpine and PPL . In addition, the settlement included numerous behavioral commitments for the Exelon and Constellation, including power capacity offers, plant uprates, unit retirements and the scheduling of Exelon’s 507-MW Conowingo hydropower project in Maryland, among other things. Monitoring Analytics is the independent market monitor responsible for promoting a competitive electric power market in PJM. PJM, the biggest power grid in the United States, oversees the power system and electric market in 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwest states and the District of Columbia. A spokesman at PJM said Tuesday the grid operator does not have a decision making role in the merger. PJM’s role is to provide information to the regulators to help them make their decisions.

The department said it required the sale to prevent the combined companies from having too much clout in power production in the mid-Atlantic states once the $7.9 billion deal closes. Two of the plants to be sold are in Maryland’s Anne Arundel County and a third is in Baltimore County, Maryland. “These divestitures will preserve that critical competition for the benefit of electricity customers throughout the mid-Atlantic,” said Sharis Pozen, acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. The planned acquisition was announced in April. “We are pleased to have reached yet another important milestone in completing our merger with Constellation,” said Exelon President Christopher Crane in a statement. “We continue to expect that we will finalize the merger in early 2012.” The merger still needs approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Maryland Public Service Commission, the state utility regulator.

59,EXC,First Solar project loan delay hits stock,"(Reuters) - First Solar (FSLR.O) said the U.S. Department of Energy has not released loan funds for a big California solar project because of construction permit issues, sending its shares down as much as 11 percent. The DOE loan delay threatens to cancel a sale of the project to Exelon Corp (EXC.N), potentially leaving First Solar on the hook for $75 million. In September, the DOE had finalized a $646 million loan guarantee to support the 230-megawatt Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One project in northern Los Angeles County. If initial funding for the project does not come by February 24, it will have to buy the project back from Exelon, First Solar said in a regulatory filing on Thursday. The DOE’s loan program has faced intense scrutiny after the high-profile collapse of Solyndra, a solar panel maker that was the first company to receive funding under the program. “We believe Exelon will not exit (the Antelope project) over minor issues like a construction permit,” Auriga USA analyst Hari Chandra Polavarapu wrote in a note to clients. First Solar, which developed and sold the Antelope project to Exelon for $75 million, said it can buy back the project with its existing cash and resources. “We note the DOE loan/loan guarantee itself is not under any threat,” Polavarapu said. First Solar had secured DOE loan guarantees for three major projects last year. They were then sold to NextEra Energy (NEE.N), NRG Energy (NRG.N) and Exelon. The world’s most valuable solar company, which has been hit by falling renewable energy subsidies in top market Europe, also said it will idle half of its production capacity in Frankfurt (Oder), starting March 1. “To minimize the impact on our 1,200 associates there, we plan to evenly divide shifts amongst the workforce and have applied to German authorities for temporary short-time support. We intend to meet demand in the EU with production from our German factory,” a First Solar spokesman said in Germany. The German factory’s capacity is about 500 megawatt (MW). About 46 percent of the company’s 2010 net sales came from the country. Shares of the Tempe, Arizona-based company were down 9 percent at $44.65 in morning trading on the Nasdaq.

69,EXC,"FERC warns US power, natgas traders on manipulation","* Constellation to pay a total of $245 million * Exelon took over Constellation this week March 15 (Reuters) - The top U.S. energy regulator on Thursday warned power and natural gas traders that it would vigorously enforce anti-manipulation rules in those markets to protect consumers after last week’s record fine against Constellation Energy. Chairman Jon Wellinghoff said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission expected all companies in those markets to abide by the terms it set last week for Constellation when it settled a market manipulation probe with a unit of the Baltimore-based power company for a total of $245 million. Constellation agreed to pay a $135 million civil penalty and to disgorge unjust profits of $110 million. It was the largest penalty FERC has imposed since Congress expanded the communion’s enforcement authority in 2005. After the settlement, Constellation CEO Mayo Shattuck said the company did not admit to any wrongdoing but agreed to settle the case to avoid litigation and pave the way for a merger with Chicago-based energy company Exelon Corp. But Wellinghoff said in a statement that FERC would hold senior managers of “all companies” accountable for monitoring compliance with terms of the Constellation settlement. He said companies would be expected to refrain from making uneconomical trades on one position in order to lift the value of a different position. FERC’s enforcement unit said Constellation’s inappropriate activity involved losing money in the New York physical power market to favorably influence payments it received under a separate financial market. Constellation and Exelon completed their merger this week. In his statement, Wellinghoff said companies would be expected to respond truthfully to questions about their trading, and also to realize that FERC “will be vigorous in using its anti-manipulation authority to protect consumers.” FERC’s enforcement staff determined Constellation engaged in manipulation in New York from September 2007 to December 2008 that resulted in economic losses to market participants who bought and sold energy in the day-ahead markets of ISO New England and the New York Independent System Operator. The staff also determined this manipulation distorted price discovery, he said. In addition to the civil penalty and disgorgement of unjust profits, Constellation had to remove the employees involved in the questionable trading activities from any position related to wholesale energy trading. Shattuck said last week that Constellation believed its trading practices “were lawful portfolio risk management transactions.” Wellinghoff’s statement said “clearly that is not the case.” “The Stipulation and Consent Agreement sets forth a detailed description of the transactions that I believe Constellation knowingly and willfully engaged in that form the basis of Enforcement Staff’s conclusion that Constellation engaged in market manipulation, fraud, and misrepresentation,” Wellinghoff said.",3152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-constellation-ferc/ferc-warns-us-power-natgas-traders-on-manipulation-idUSL2E8EF63B20120315

89,EXC,"Exelon drops Texas reactor plan, cites cheap natgas","(Reuters) - Exelon Corp will halt efforts to gain regulatory approval to build a new nuclear plant in southeast Texas, the company said on Tuesday. Chicago-based Exelon, the nation’s largest nuclear operator, said it notified the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission that it will withdraw its application for an early site permit for land near Victoria in southeast Texas. “The action is in response to low natural gas prices and economic and market conditions that have made construction of new merchant nuclear power plants in competitive markets uneconomical now and for the foreseeable future,” said Charles Pardee, Exelon Generation’s chief operating officer. In 2008, Exelon announced a plan to develop two new reactors at the Texas site, becoming the 12th applicant to seek a combined construction and operating license (COL) from nuclear regulators as power companies rushed to qualify for financial incentives offered under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. By 2010, however, industry enthusiasm for new nuclear plants began to wane as the recession cut into electric demand, costs for nuclear construction soared, carbon legislation was delayed and natural gas supplies began to rise, making nuclear plants less competitive. Exelon withdrew its COL application, but continued to pursue the early site permit to allow it to keep the project alive but defer construction for as long as 20 years. “Today’s withdrawal brings an end to all project activity,” Exelon said in a statement. “This is all about the economics of the project, which are driven by commodity and financial markets,” said Marilyn Kray, vice president of nuclear project development. While abandoning the Texas nuclear project, Exelon remains active in Texas’ $32 billion deregulated market, officials said. Following its merger with Constellation Energy, Exelon operates more than 4,000 megawatts of gas-fired and wind generation capacity in the Texas deregulated market. Its StarTex unit sells electricity to more than 144,000 residential customers and its Constellation New Energy unit sells power to nearly 35,000 commercial accounts. Of the dozens of new U.S. reactors proposed, only six or so may be built in the next decade. The NRC has so far approved licenses to allow Southern Co to build two new reactors in Georgia and Scana Corp to build two reactors in South Carolina.

Late last year, the NRC said it would not issue a license to build the new STP reactors because current project ownership does not meet foreign ownership restrictions. Dallas-based Luminant, a unit of Energy Future Holdings, has delayed the completion schedule for its proposed two-unit expansion at the Comanche Peak nuclear station in north Texas until 2021 and 2022.

94,EXC,"UPDATE 4-Sandy curtails US nuclear plants, oldest under alert","* Exelon declares alert at NJ Oyster Creek reactor * Water levels at Oyster Creek declining * Exelon says no threat to public health or safety By Scott DiSavino NEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Hurricane Sandy slowed or shut a half-dozen U.S. nuclear power plants, while the nation’s oldest facility declared a rare “alert” after the record storm surge pushed flood waters high enough to endanger a key cooling system. Exelon Corp’s 43-year-old Oyster Creek plant in New Jersey remains on “alert” status, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) said early Tuesday. It is only the third time this year that the second-lowest of four emergency action levels was triggered. “Oyster Creek is still in an alert but may be getting out of it as long as water levels continue to drop,” NRC spokesman Neil Sheehan told Reuters. The alert came after water levels at the plant rose more than 6.5 feet (2 meters) above normal, potentially affecting the “water intake structure” that pumps cooling water through the plant. Those pumps are not essential to keep the reactor cool since the plant has been shut for planned refuelling since Oct. 22. Exelon however was concerned that if the water rose over 7 feet it could submerge the service water pump motor that is used to cool the water in the spent fuel pool, potentially forcing it to use emergency water supplies from the in-house fire suppression system to keep the rods from overheating. Exelon also moved a portable pump to the intake structure as a precaution in case it was needed to pump cooling water. The water levels reached a peak of 7.4 feet — apparently above the threshold — but the pump motors did not flood, Sheehan said. As of 11 a.m. EDT Tuesday the water level was down to 5.8 feet, with the next high tide at 11:45 a.m. “They need the water level to stay below 6 feet for a while to exit the alert,” Sheehan said, noting when the water level falls below 4.5 feet, the plant could exit the unusual event. An unusual event is the lowest of the NRC’s emergency action levels. Exelon said in a statement that there was no danger to equipment and no threat to public health or safety. “Right now there’s no imminent threat of releases. There’s no protective actions around the plant,” Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate said on the Today Show. “Some of these reporting requirements are due though to the severity of the storms. That they have to make these notifications based upon conditions, that does not mean that they are in an imminent threat at the plant,” Fugate said. The incident at Oyster Creek, which is about 60 miles (95 km) east of Philadelphia on the New Jersey Coast, came as Sandy made landfall as the largest Atlantic storm ever, bringing up to 90 mile per hour (mph) winds and 13-foot storm surges in the biggest test of the industry’s emergency preparedness since the Fukushima disaster in Japan a year and a half ago. Despite the alert — which is a serious but not catastrophic event that signals a “potential substantial degradation in the level of safety” — the U.S. nuclear industry was broadly seen having passed the test. About a dozen alerts have been issued in the past four years, according to NRC press releases. On Tuesday morning, the NRC said that Entergy Corp’s  Indian Point 3 automatically tripped offline at about 10:41 p.m. last night due to fluctuations in the power grid caused by the storm, while Public Service Enterprise Group Inc shut Unit 1 at Salem in New Jersey at 1:10 a.m. due to a loss of “condenser circulators” due to the storm surge and debris. The relatively small 636-megawatt (MW) Oyster Creek plant earlier experienced a “power disruption” at its switch yard, causing two backup diesel generators to kick in and maintain a stable source of power, Exelon said. The NRC spokesman said the company could use water from a fire suppression system or a portable pump to cool the pool if necessary. The used uranium rods in the pool could cause the water to boil in about 25 hours without additional coolant; in an extreme scenario the rods could overheat, risking the eventual release of radiation. The concerns over the status of the spent fuel pool at Oyster Creek was reminiscent of the fears that followed the Fukushima disaster last year, when helicopters and fire hoses were enlisted to ensure the pools remained filled with fresh, cool water. The nuclear industry has said that the spent fuel rods at Fukushima were never exposed to the air. Nuclear plants must store the spent uranium fuel rods for at least five years in order to cool them sufficiently before they can be moved to dry cask storage containers. Exelon spokesman David Tillman said Monday night the plant has “multiple and redundant” sources of cooling for the spent fuel pool. The plant uses pumps to take in external water that circulates through a heat exchanger used to cool the internal water that surrounds the rods, keeping them from overheating. Among other units, Constellation Energy Nuclear Group’s 630-MW Nine Mile Point 1 nuclear power reactor in upstate New York did shut due to a problem putting power onto the grid, although it was not clear whether the trouble was related to the storm. In addition, Sandy caused power reductions at both units at Exelon’s Limerick nuclear plant in Pennsylvania and one unit at Dominion’s Millstone plant in Connecticut.",10302012,http://www.reuters.com/article/storm-sandy-exelon-oystercreek/update-4-sandy-curtails-us-nuclear-plants-oldest-under-alert-idUSL3E8LU1S120121030

103,EXC,Exelon cuts nuclear expansion projects amid low natgas prices,"Feb 7 (Reuters) - Low natural gas prices and slow economic growth forced U.S. power company Exelon Corp to cancel plans to spend $2.3 billion to expand capacity at its nuclear power plants and other projects, Chief Executive Chris Crane said Thursday. To support its credit rating and dividend, Exelon officials decided to reduce capital spending after an evaluation of the performance of its 35,000-megawatt generating plants against low commodity prices and lackluster demand growth for electricity. Crane said on a conference call that Exelon’s nuclear, coal and gas-fired power plants remain economical and the company has no plans to shut any units. Exelon will continue to evaluate the impact of low commodity prices, the economic recovery and competition from what Crane called “subsidized generation” to determine if early shutdowns are needed. “Nothing that we see today would drive us to do that unless we see further degradation,” Crane said. Exelon operates the nation’s largest group of nuclear plants and in 2009 launched a series of nuclear expansions, called “uprates,” to add as much as 1,300 megawatts of generating capacity over several years at about half the cost of building a new reactor. An abundant supply of natural gas which reduced gas prices to the lowest level in more than 10 years has already forced some power companies to abandon plans to build new nuclear units and to shutter older coal-fired plants rather than invest in equipment to meet stricter federal environmental standards. An announcement earlier this week by Duke Energy to retire, rather than repair, a damaged Florida nuclear unit has been viewed as a sign that lower power and gas prices may be a threat to some existing nuclear plants. {ID:nL1N0B635L]",2072013,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-exelon/exelon-cuts-nuclear-expansion-projects-amid-low-natgas-prices-idUSL1N0B76ZW20130207

This week, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) accepted the company’s application to increase the output at its Peach Bottom nuclear plant in Pennsylvania by 12.4 percent. The two reactors at Peach Bottom currently have a capacity of 1,122 MW and the changes would add about 260 MW of capacity to the plant, Exelon said. One megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes. The NRC said the standard review time for a so-called extended power uprate (EPU) application is 18 months after the agency formally accepts the application.

The NRC in 2012 said it put the review of the Byron and Braidwood on hold until Exelon provides more information. In 2012, however, Exelon adjusted its uprate program - delaying a planned uprate at Limerick - primarily due weak market conditions, including weak natural gas and power prices and the continued sluggish economy. Exelon said it had not yet determined the uprate percentage for Limerick but noted it would not exceed about 12 percent. As of the end of 2012, Exelon said the program has delivered an additional 310 MW. The company said about 75 percent of its planned output increases are either complete or are in the installation or design and engineering phases. The remaining 25 percent, if and when completed, would come from the uprate at Limerick currently scheduled to begin in 2017. The company does not release projected costs on plant specific uprate projects.",3142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-exelon-peachbottom/exelons-could-add-1100-mw-to-its-u-s-nuclear-output-idUSL1N0C51XA20130314

110,EXC,"UPDATE 3-EDF exits U.S. nuclear, ups earnings outlook","* EDF agrees on future exit from US nuclear venture * Gets put option from Exelon for exit from 2016 * French nuclear, Italy gas contract deals boost outlook * Shares jump 6.5 pct on earnings outlook upgrade By Geert De Clercq PARIS, July 30 (Reuters) - French utility EDF, the world’s biggest operator of nuclear plants, is pulling out of nuclear energy in the United States, bowing to the realities of a market that has been transformed by cheap shale gas. Several nuclear reactors in the U.S. have been closed or are being shuttered as utilities baulk at the big investments needed to extend their lifetimes now that nuclear power has been so decisively undercut by electricity generated from shale gas. “The spectacular fall of the price of gas in the U.S., which was unimaginable a few years ago, has made this form of energy ultra competitive vis a vis all other forms of energy,” EDF Chief Executive Henri Proglio told a news conference. EDF agreed with its partner Exelon on an exit from their Constellation Energy Nuclear Group (CENG) joint venture, which operates five nuclear plants in the United States with a total capacity of 3.9 gigawatts. The French utility said it had agreed a put option that allows EDF to sell CENG to Exelon at the fair value of its stake between January 2016 and June 2022. EDF will also receive an exceptional dividend from CENG of $400 million, it said. “Circumstances for the development of nuclear in the U.S. are not favorable at the moment,” Proglio said. International Energy Agency analyst Dennis Volk said CENG’s eastern U.S. power plants were located in some of the most competitive power markets in the country, with high price competition, growing wind capacity and cheap gas. “It is simply not easy to invest in nuclear and recover your money there,” Volk said. Proglio said EDF would now focus on renewable energy in the United States. EDF employs 860 people in U.S. solar and wind, and since 2010 its generating capacity has doubled to 2.3 gigawatts. It manages another 7 gigawatts for other companies. EDF, Europe’s biggest power producer by output, also employs 320 staff in its U.S. energy trading operation, which is the number one exporter of U.S. coal to Europe. Morgan Stanley analyst Emmanuel Turpin welcomed the U.S. nuclear exit. “Management inherited this situation. I am pleased with the decision; it shows focus on unlocking value,” he said. The French utility’s American atomic adventure started in 2008, when Proglio’s predecessor Pierre Gadonneix bought a 49 percent stake in power group Constellation’s nuclear plants for $4.7 billion, and accepted a $2 billion put option giving Constellation the right to sell EDF more power plants. Gadonneix talked about building up to four Areva-designed  European Pressurised Reactors in the U.S., but the firms disagreed on implementation, and as the U.S. nuclear outlook darkened, the put became a millstone for EDF. Exelon’s 2011 takeover of Constellation further complicated things. EDF finance chief Thomas Piquemal said the U.S. nuclear adventure had led to 2 billion euros in writedowns in 2009-2012. EDF’s U.S. investment totalled 6.4 billion euros, but was partly recouped by selling Exelon shares, he said. “This was the last and final chapter of our U.S. nuclear investment,” Piquemal said. Proglio said the decision would have no impact on talks with the UK government about building reactors in Britain. The government and EDF are negotiating the minimum price for electricity produced from the firm’s proposed Hinkley Point site, Britain’s first new nuclear plant in several decades. Proglio said he expected those talks to wrap up by year-end. EDF also said that because of the strong performance of its French nuclear fleet and a renegotiation of Italian gas contracts, it raised its outlook for core profit growth in 2013 to at least 3 percent from a range of zero to 3 percent. First-half earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 6.9 percent to 9.7 billion euros, net income 3.5 percent to 2.9 billion. EDF shares surged 7 percent, nearly setting a two-year high, as markets focused on the outlook upgrade, despite the tough economic and regulatory environment, a Paris trader said. After sinking nearly 70 percent between early 2010 and late 2012, EDF shares have gained 54 percent this year, making them the top performers in France’s CAC 40 index. The shares have been helped by French government plans for the biggest increase in power prices in at least a decade to cover rising costs at the state-owned utility.",7302013,http://www.reuters.com/article/edf-results/update-3-edf-exits-u-s-nuclear-ups-earnings-outlook-idUSL6N0G00MZ20130730
111,EXC,"Exelon staying with nuclear plants, despite weak power market -CEO","July 31 (Reuters) - Exelon Corp, the biggest nuclear power operator in the United States, said Wednesday that weak prices for power and for natural gas have pushed it to reduce operating and maintenance costs but the company is not yet giving up on any of its reactors. U.S. generating companies so far in 2013 have retired four reactors, the most in any year, due to weak power market conditions or because the plants were too costly to repair. “We have worked hard over the last couple of years to continue to focus on cost to maintain some of the viability of the smaller units,” Exelon CEO Christopher Crane told analysts in a conference call following release of the company’s second quarter earnings. “There is nothing on the chopping block right now. It is constant work to look at cost. It is constant work to look at regulatory structure and if it does not improve we will be talking more about those facilities.” Crane mentioned two of the company’s smaller reactors - the 1,065-megawatt Clinton in Illinois and the 581-MW Ginna in New York. Clinton employees have come up with a “good plan” to move the plant to an annual refueling and maintenance outage cycle instead of the current biennial cycle, he said. That new outage cycle would help keep Clinton “viable for years to come as the market recovers,” he said. Clinton is next expected to shut for refueling and maintenance in the autumn of 2013, according to Reuters data. “It’s a well run plant that last year had a zero-forced loss rate, so we are not ready to give up on it, we will continue to optimize its cost structure, maintaining it is safe but also neutral on the balance sheet,” Crane said. As for Ginna, Crane said bringing the small reactor “into the Exelon cost structure” will “give us time” to look at the policies evolving in New York around the power capacity market and transmission. Exelon and French power company Electricite de France SA , the co-owners of Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, which operates Ginna, this week said Exelon Generation will take over operation of Constellation’s five reactors over the next nine months. Constellation operates two reactors at the 1,595-MW Nine Mile plant in New York, two reactors at the 1,753-MW Calvert Cliffs plant in Maryland and Ginna. After integrating the Constellation plants, Exelon said it will operate 22 reactors at 13 locations in Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Maryland with a total generating capacity of 19,165 MW and more than 11,000 workers. One megawatt can power about 1,000 homes.

117,EXC,Exelon quarrel with IRS could threaten tax-free exchange deals,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Energy group Exelon Corp is fighting the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in court over a $517 million tax bill in a case that tax lawyers said could lead to new restrictions on businesses’ ability to do tax-free property exchange deals. Such exchanges are common legal strategies for avoiding capital gains tax. Thousands are carried out annually, though the Exelon deal at issue was unusually large. If Exelon loses its case against the IRS in U.S. Tax Court, tax-free property exchange deals, even smaller ones, could be at risk of more often being labeled “abusive tax shelters,” by the agency, tax lawyers said this week. “People are already on edge ... it is going to put a crimp on this type of transaction,” said Stefan Tucker, a lawyer with Venable LLP, who is not involved in the case. He said he thinks the case will likely be appealed regardless of the Tax Court’s decision. ‘LIKE-KIND’ DEALS Exelon is defending two tax-free property exchanges worth more than $1 billion combined. They were carried out by one of its units in 1999, according to a Tax Court filing. The IRS contends that the exchanges were “a potentially abusive tax shelter,” said Exelon, the largest U.S. nuclear power plant operator, in a November 2013 regulatory filing. A spokesman for Chicago-based Exelon declined to comment and referred questions to the company’s regulatory filings. The IRS, which also declined to comment, has not yet filed a response to Exelon’s Tax Court petition challenging the tax bill. The company does not have to pay the bill while litigation is ongoing. A trial has not yet been scheduled. The dispute centers on a tax break that lets an individual or business sell an asset - often real estate - and pay no capital gains tax on any profit if the asset is replaced within a certain time period with a similar, or “like-kind,” asset. Tax-free exchanges must be done following strict rules on timing, intermediaries and any cash involved. Corporations filed more than 64,000 forms with the IRS in 2010 declaring so-called like-kind exchanges, while individuals filed more than 150,000 such forms that same year, the most recent year for which data was available. In the Exelon case, the IRS is arguing that the company “did not acquire and retain significant and genuine attributes of a traditional owner,” to satisfy the like-kind exchange rules, according to court documents. The case traces back to 1999 when an Exelon subsidiary sold some of its fossil fuel power plants to comply with new regulations. With the sale proceeds, the subsidiary acquired three power plants in Georgia and Texas in what the company said it structured as a tax-free exchange. The Exelon subsidiary then leased the Georgia and Texas properties back to the local governments that operated them. The governments paid advance rent to the Exelon unit totaling more than $1 billion, according to court filings. The rent payments were part of a “sale in, lease out,” or SILO, deal that was integral to the tax-free exchange. The IRS contends that by leasing the properties, the Exelon unit did not take proper possession of the plants it got in the exchange. The IRS views some SILO deals as tax shelters and has won SILO disputes in court, including an unrelated one against Exelon last year in a federal appellate court. “SILOs are old tax shelters and courts have ruled against them numerous times,” said Bradley Borden, a Brooklyn Law School tax professor. He added that if the SILO portion of the power plants exchange does not hold up in court, Exelon could lose and its case could have “a chilling effect” on similar deals. “Exelon is going to have a hard time winning,” Borden said. However, in court fights over like-kind exchanges, “the IRS has a pretty bad track record,” said David Shechtman, a lawyer with Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP who is not involved in the case. Exelon’s transaction was not a typical SILO and that might help the company prove it was playing by the rules, he said.

119,EXC,U.S. NRC okays 5 reactor license transfers from Constellation to Exelon,"April 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said on Tuesday it has approved the proposed direct transfer of operating licenses from Constellation Energy Nuclear Group (CENG) subsidiaries to Exelon Corp for five commercial nuclear power reactors and three spent fuel storage installations. The transfer of operating licenses will be for Constellation’s five nuclear power reactors at three plant sites - Calvert Cliffs 1 and 2 in Maryland, Nine Mile Point 1 and 2, and R.E. Ginna in New York and the associated independent spent fuel storage installations, the regulator said. The NRC had approved the indirect transfer of the licenses in February 2012 when Exelon merged with Constellation Energy Partners LLC, CENG’s parent company. “The current direct transfer allows Exelon to integrate the operations of the facilities into its existing nuclear fleet,” the NRC said in a statement. The license transfers will not result in any physical changes to the facilities. The on-site organizations and plant staff, including senior managers, will remain unchanged by the license transfers, the NRC said. Exelon currently owns 50.01 percent of CENG, which is jointly owned with EDF Inc, a subsidiary of Electricité de France SA. Long Island Power Authority’s 18 percent ownership in Nine Mile Point 2 reactor will not be affected by the license transfers, the NRC said. Existing Exelon licenses will also not be affected, it added.

120,EXC,Exelon to become top U.S. power distributor with Pepco buy,"(Reuters) - Exelon Corp said it would buy Pepco Holdings Inc for $6.83 billion, helping it overtake Duke Energy Corp as the biggest power distribution company in the United States. The deal will allow Exelon to sell more power at stable rates set by regulators at a time when an abundance of cheap natural gas is dragging down power prices in the open market. Exelon’s move to reduce its exposure to the vagaries of the wholesale power market comes as U.S. utilities struggle with falling electricity demand in both the open and regulated markets due to increased energy efficiency and a weak economy. However, Exelon’s stock fell as much as 5 percent to $34.22. “Some investors might question Exelon’s desire to increase the company’s regulated exposure at a time when power markets appear to be recovering,” said Wells Fargo analyst Neil Kalton. The company defended the acquisition saying it was maintaining substantial exposure to the recovery in prices. “The acquisition also supports our belief in the value of an integrated utility, with a balanced mix of regulated and non-regulated cash flows,” Exelon Chief Executive Chris Crane, who will lead the combined company, said on a conference call. Exelon said its earnings from the regulated business is expected to rise to as much as 65 percent after the deal, from about 60 percent now. Pepco’s shares rose as much as 18 percent before closing 17.4 percent higher at $26.76, slightly below Exelon’s offer price of $27.25 per share, despite fears of severe regulatory scrutiny for the deal. However, two experts said the deal was unlikely to run into serious trouble from regulators, who most likely will include the U.S. Justice Department, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and public utility commissions in New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and the District of Columbia. There is no antitrust issue since the two companies don’t have customers in the same areas, said Bruce McDonald, an antitrust expert with Jones Day law firm. Pepco operates utilities in the District of Columbia, Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey, serving about 2 million customers. Exelon’s utilities deliver electricity and natural gas to more than 6.6 million customers in Maryland, Illinois and Pennsylvania. The acquisition would not deter Exelon from buying more renewable and conventional power assets, Crane said. At the same time, the company is looking to raise up to $1 billion by selling non-core assets, he said. Weak power prices and consumption have spurred consolidation among utilities in the past three years, with Exelon itself having bought Constellation Energy for $7.9 billion in 2011. Duke Energy and AES Corp have also made acquisitions. Exelon said it expected Pepco to “significantly” add to adjusted earnings in the first full year after the deal closed. The company also reported a lower-than-expected profit for the first quarter, hurt by weak energy prices and a fall in nuclear and coal output.

Gross domestic product expanded at a 0.1 percent annual rate, the slowest since the fourth quarter of 2012, as exports and inventories weighed, but activity already appears to be bouncing back. It was a sharp pullback from the fourth quarter’s 2.6 percent pace. U.S. private employers, however, beat expectations by adding 220,000 workers in April, the highest amount since November, and gains in the prior month were revised up. Chicago business activity also rose more than expected in April, jumping to its highest since October 2013.

133,EXC,GE inks more than $500 million power equipment order with Exelon,"(Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) said on Monday it has won an order worth more than $500 million to provide power-generating equipment to U.S.-based Exelon Corp (EXC.N), including four of GE’s highest efficiency gas turbines. Exelon said it was planning to build two combined-cycle gas turbine units in Texas using the GE technology.  The new units are being built at Exelon’s Colorado Bend site in Wharton County, Texas, and at its Wolf Hollow natural gas plant in Granbury, Texas. Each will add about 1,000 megawatts of capacity to the respective sites. GE said it was the first U.S. order for GE’s highest efficiency HA gas turbine, after winning customers from Japan, France and Russia, and now has orders for 13 units. GE said the H-class turbine being sold to Exelon converts more than 61 percent of gas to electricity. The turbine allows for more than $8 million in annual fuel savings per gas turbine compared to the older F-class technology, GE said. “With these more efficient turbines, they’re just going to use less fuel, and so that helps the consumer and the cost of electricity go down,” Victor Abate, president of power generation products at GE Power & Water, said in an interview. The H-class turbine stands as one of the important products as GE invests further in its power business. The U.S. conglomerate earlier this year agreed to buy the power arm of France’s Alstom (ALSO.PA) for $16.9 billion, GE’s largest ever deal.

Maryland’s Public Service Commission said on Friday it would approve the deal, which would create the biggest U.S. power generator, if Exelon would agree to 46 conditions. Exelon, for example, agreed to give $66 million in residential rate credits and spend $43.2 million for energy efficiency programs for a total of $109.2 million. The companies must also establish a $19.8 million Green Sustainability Fund and pledge that Exelon would preserve Pepco’s plans to improve reliability in snow and rainstorms. Exelon President Chris Crane said the state’s order on the transaction was constructive, though “challenging.” Three members of the state’s utility-regulating commission voted to approve the deal. The two who dissented said the deal will, if allowed, create a company providing 80 percent of Maryland’s electric power. That would reduce competition, raise rates and “eviscerate economic protections due to a weakened and compromised corporate governance structure,” they wrote.

141,EXC,New power rules may preserve Exelon nuclear plants in Illinois,"(Reuters) - New rules for U.S. electricity providers could save two money-losing nuclear power plants in Illinois from shutting down and may amount to a $10 billion bonanza to U.S. power producers. A system of rewards and penalties is part of a requirement approved last month by federal energy regulators that applies to a power auction next month. It may benefit some costly nuclear reactors in the PJM power region, which stretches from New Jersey to Illinois, that have had a tough time competing against the growing use of wind turbines and power plants fired with cheap natural gas. That is particularly true for two plants operated by Exelon Corp, the biggest U.S. nuclear power plant operator. It has warned it might be forced to shut its Quad Cities and Byron nuclear plants in northern Illinois, unless the reactors’ revenues increase. Other generators expected to benefit from the new requirements, including those with nuclear plants located far away from the Midwest wind farms, include Dynegy Inc, NRG Energy Inc, Public Service Enterprise Group Inc and Talen Energy Corp. Thanks to the growth of alternative power sources and abundant gas from shale formations, PJM power prices have fallen an average of 20 percent over the past five years to around $50 per megawatt hour compared with the prior five years. The regulation should provide generators with more money for keeping their units ready to operate when most needed to avoid unexpected power plant outages like those that pushed the system to the brink of blackouts as homes and businesses cranked up their heaters during the polar vortex winter of 2013/2014. The rule creates a niche for nuclear plants, which run consistently, unlike breeze-dependent wind turbines, and do not need potential upgrades to withstand harsh winter temperatures like gas plants.    Under so-called capacity performance requirements, generators will receive higher fees to keep plants available but face stiff penalties if their units don’t deliver power when needed during system emergencies. Fines for an average 100-megawatt plant would be around $350,000 an hour. One megawatt can power about 1,000 homes. PJM will hold the auction starting August 10 for power capacity for the June 2018-to-May 2019 time period that will include the capacity performance standards.  Capacity performance prices for the 2018-2019 delivery year are expected to increase by about 25 percent over last year’s rates to around $150 to $165 per megawatt day, according to analysts, which could total about $10 billion for the power resources sought in the auction. If analysts’ estimates are correct and all ten of Exelon’s reactors in northern Illinois are selected to provide capacity in the auction, the company could receive around $600 million for those reactors during the 2018-2019 delivery year. “We expect the vast majority of our nuclear units will clear the auction,” Joseph Dominguez, Exelon’s executive vice president for government and regulatory affairs told Reuters, meaning the company expects most of its reactors in PJM to receive capacity payments for the 2018-2019 delivery year. He would not speculate on what might happen with Quad Cities and Byron in Illinois and Oyster Creek in New Jersey, which did not clear last year’s auction for the 2017-2018 delivery year that did not include the capacity performance standards. Exelon has already said it planned to retire Oyster Creek in the fourth quarter of 2019, but has not set a closure plan for the Illinois plants. With the new capacity standards in place, some analysts said Byron and Quad Cities, which are located in Exelon’s Commonwealth Edison (ComEd) power delivery zone in northern Illinois, will make the grade for continuing to operate.  “Byron and Quad Cities will clear the 2018-2019 auction because we think the ComEd zone will price at a higher level than the rest of PJM,” said Prajit Ghosh, research director North America power, at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consultancy. Exelon has lost close to $1 billion over the past five years on its nuclear operations - about $350 million at Quad Cities alone. It expects those losses to continue, based on forward power prices, Dominguez said. Even if Byron and Quad Cities clear the auction, Dominguez said they still face the risk of shutdown unless federal, state and regional policy makers find ways to compensate generators for the environmental and reliability benefits that non-carbon emitting nuclear plants provide. In the meantime, extra revenues from the capacity auction could keep the money losing reactors operating for a few more years until possible new carbon standards are available.

142,EXC,Washington D.C. regulators reject Exelon-Pepco power merger,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Utilities regulators for the District of Columbia on Tuesday denied Exelon Corp’s $6.8 billion bid for Pepco Holdings Inc, dealing a major blow to a deal that would have created the country’s top power distributor. Pepco shares fell 15.4 percent, and Exelon was down about 4 percent after the D.C. Public Service Commission said the companies had not proven that the proposed merger was in the public interest. The three-member commission was the final regulatory hurdle for the deal, which was announced in April 2014. The four other states required to approve the deal had voted in favor of the merger. The companies, which have 30 days to ask the commission to reconsider its order, said they were disappointed in the decision and would review their options. If the commission rejects an application for reconsideration, the companies would then have the option of appealing the decision to the D.C. Court of Appeals. The companies may also choose to submit another application. “Lately we have seen a trend of regulatory commissions rejecting deals and leaving the door open for a re-submitted application with enhanced terms for rate-payers,” said Daniel Fidell, of USCA Securities LLC. “That door is open for Exelon and Pepco. I expect they will be doing so,” he added. Commission Chairwoman Betty Ann Kane said the decision was one of the most important rulings that the agency would ever make. She said that while the merger would offer some benefits, some factors could prove harmful to the District. “Pepco would become a second-tier company in a much larger corporation whose primary interest is not in distribution, but in generation,” Kane said at the hearing where the decision was announced. Opponents of the deal have said it would raise rates for consumers while limiting growth of renewable power in the region. “The proposed acquisition would have been a substantial step backwards in the District’s efforts to move toward more sustainable electricity generation and greater reliance on local, renewable energy,” said Power DC, a coalition of environmentalists and public advocacy groups. Pepco serves about 2 million customers in the District of Columbia, Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey. Exelon has about 7.8 million customers in Maryland, Illinois and Pennsylvania. Before the D.C. rejection, the proposed transaction had won approval from Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Virginia and the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. It is not clear how the D.C. public service commission’s decision would affect an ongoing review by the Justice Department. A department spokesman declined to comment on Tuesday. The Public Service Commission was established in 1913 and regulates power, gas and telecommunication companies in the District of Columbia. On the New York Stock Exchange, Exelon closed down 6.9 percent at $30.40, and Pepco dropped 16.5 percent to close at  $22.51.

In a dramatic session, major indices turned negative in the final minutes of trading after previously climbing almost 3 percent. Investors cited more worries that a slowdown in China could hobble global growth, even after the country’s central bank cut interest rates on Tuesday for the second time in two months.     The move came after Chinese stocks slumped 8 percent on Tuesday, on top of an 8.5 percent drop on Monday. “People are still nervous about overseas and what might happen tonight. Nobody wants to sit around and see what happens,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. Tuesday’s drop followed steeper losses on Monday, when the Dow Jones industrial average slid more than 1,000 points at its lows and the benchmark S&P; 500 recorded its worst day since 2011. In the past week, the S&P; has lost 11 percent. The Dow has fallen 10.5 pct over the last five sessions, marking its biggest five-day fall since August 2011. “Investors are still concerned about exogenous growth and shifting Fed policy, and both of those are still on the table,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 204.91 points, or 1.29 percent, to end at 15,666.44. The S&P; 500 lost 25.59 points, or 1.35 percent, to finish at 1,867.62 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 19.76 points, or 0.44 percent, to 4,506.49. Earlier, the S&P; rose as much 2.9 percent, the Dow as much as 2.8 percent and the Nasdaq as much as 3.6 percent. JPMorgan cut its year-end target for the S&P; 500 to 2,150 from 2,250. In the sixth straight session of losses for the S&P; 500, all of the 10 major sectors were lower, with the utilities index’s  3.2-percent drop leading the decline. Pepco Holdings Inc fell 16.47 percent after a District of Columbia regulator denied Exelon Corp’s $6.8 billion bid for the power utility, possibly delivering a knockout blow to the deal. The recent pummeling in U.S. shares has reduced valuations some investors had seen as pricey. The S&P; 500 was down to about 15 times expected earnings, compared to around 17 for much of 2015 and just above a 10-year average of 14.7, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data for Monday, the most recent available. Data on Tuesday showed U.S. consumer confidence increased to a seven-month high in August. New U.S. single-family home sales rebounded in July, adding to evidence of underlying strength in the economy that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year.

160,EXC,UPDATE 2-D.C. commission offers deal to save Exelon's plan to buy Pepco,"(Adds conditions, comment from opponents) WASHINGTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - The D.C. Public Service Commission voted on Friday to make revisions to an offer that Exelon Corp made in order to win approval for its merger with Pepco Holdings Inc, after first rejecting the companies’ improved offer. The commission gave Exelon 14 days to accept the proposed conditions. If it does so, the deal “will be approved as in the public interest without further commission action,” the commission said in a statement. Exelon said it would mull the offer. “The commission’s order prescribes new provisions that we and the settling parties must carefully review to determine whether they are acceptable,” Exelon spokesman Paul Elsberg said in a statement. D.C. Councilmember Mary Cheh, in an interview on local radio, described the changes as relatively minor. “It is effectively a done deal,” said Cheh, who had opposed the merger. Allison Fisher of Public Citizen, which also opposed the deal, was critical of the commission’s proposal. “This is a huge loss for consumers, a discouraging setback for the institutions entrusted to protect them and a sad commentary on how things are done in the District,” she said in a statement. The deal would create the country’s top power distributor. The alternative terms proposed by the commission would change the oversight of some of the $72.8 million offered by Exelon. It also cancels a portion of the previous settlement that would have designated Exelon as the developer of a 5 megawatt solar project at a D.C. water treatment plant. The commission had said on Aug. 25 that it would not approve the $6.8 billion deal but reopened consideration in October. The commission took two votes on the deal on Friday, at first rejecting Exelon’s sweetened offer. Commissioner Joanne Doddy Fort then proposed a set of alternative measures, which the commission voted 2-to-1 to accept. The proposed transaction has won approval from Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Virginia and the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Pepco does not generate electricity but delivers it to about 2 million customers in the District of Columbia, Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey.

Gas is expected to top coal as the nation’s biggest source of power generation in 2016, according to federal energy estimates. Coal has been the primary fuel source for U.S. power plants for the last century, but its use has declined since peaking in 2007 due to low gas and power prices that make it uneconomic to upgrade older units to meet stricter environmental rules. Coal is not the only victim of low gas prices. Nuclear operators have shut five reactors since 2013 and have threatened to close several more primarily because U.S. power prices have collapsed to decade lows due to low gas prices, making it uneconomic to keep running or make needed repairs to the nuclear units. Exelon said Clinton will close on June 1, 2017, and Quad Cities will close on June 1, 2018. Quad Cities and Clinton have lost a combined $800 million in the past seven years, despite being two of Exelon’s best-performing plants, the company added. Exelon was hoping the Illinois Legislature would adopt legislation, known as the Next Generation Energy Plan, that would compensate nuclear reactors for the reliability, environmental and economic benefits they provide like round-the-clock power with no carbon emissions, and jobs and taxes for the local communities. “While the Illinois legislative session has not ended, the path forward for consideration of the Next Generation Energy Plan legislation is not clear,” Exelon said. The company said it would immediately take one-time charges of $150 million to $200 million for 2016 and accelerate about $2 billion in depreciation and amortization through the announced shutdown dates. Exelon said it will continue to work with stakeholders on passing the legislation but it may come too late to save some plants. The Clinton and Quad Cities plants support about 4,200 direct and indirect jobs and produce more than $1.2 billion in economic activity annually, Exelon said. There are nearly 700 workers at Clinton and 800 workers at Quad Cities. The Clinton plant began service in 1987, while Quad Cities began service in 1972.

185,EXC,UPDATE 1-N.Y. regulators approve clean energy standard with nuclear subsidies,"(Reuters) - New York state energy regulators on Monday approved a plan to pay several upstate nuclear power plants up to $965 million over two years to keep the reactors in service and meet the state’s carbon reduction goals. The New York Public Service Commission (PSC) approved the proposed Clean Energy Standard, which requires that 50 percent of the state’s power will come from clean and renewable sources of energy by 2030, including nuclear power. The subsidies are part of an effort to keep the nuclear reactors, which produce almost no emissions, operating at a time of low prices for power as well as for natural gas, an alternative generator fuel. New York’s plan could provide a model for the rest of the country to save the struggling nuclear industry while reducing carbon emissions. Several nuclear plants in New York and across the country may have to shut over the next few years because power prices are lower than reactor operating costs due to ample supplies of cheap gas from shale fields. PSC staff estimated the economic and environmental benefits of keeping the reactors in service at about $5 billion over the first two years of the program, for a net benefit of about $4 billion since the cost of the nuclear subsidy was calculated at up to $965 million. Reactors eligible for the program include Exelon Corp’s Ginna and Nine Mile Point Units 1 and 2, and Entergy Corp’s FitzPatrick. “We could not possibly replace those nuclear units if they were to shut,” PSC Chair Audrey Zibelman said during a question and answer period before the vote. Zibelman said the energy lost would almost certainly be replaced by fossil-fired, carbon producing power plants. Entergy, which has said it would shut FitzPatrick in 2017, is in discussions with Exelon for the potential sale of FitzPatrick. The companies have said those discussions depend on the terms and timeliness of the state’s Clean Energy Standard. The plan included only the upstate reactors because prices there are expected to be too low to cover the operating and other costs of those plants. Entergy’s Indian Point Units 2 and 3 were not included in the program, at least for the first two years, because down state power prices were expected to remain high enough to cover the plant’s operating and other costs, the report said. Entergy is seeking to renew the operating licenses for the two Indian Point reactors, while New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has opposed the continued operation of the plant because it is located in the heavily populated New York metropolitan area about 40 miles north of New York City.

190,EXC,UPDATE 1-Energy industry coalition sues NY PSC over nuclear subsidies,"(Adds Exelon statement, paragraph 9) Oct 19 (Reuters) - An energy industry coalition including competitive non-nuclear electricity producers sued on Wednesday to oppose a plan to subsidize nuclear power plants in New York State. The lawsuit in federal court said the New York Public Service Commission’s (PSC) plan to raise electric rates across the state by requiring consumers to pay for zero emission credits (ZECs), infringes illegally into federal regulators’ territory. The coalition said in a statement that the litigation was  “solely to save several New York nuclear plants that, allegedly, can no longer compete successfully in the federally-regulated wholesale electric power market.” The subsidies were part of an effort to keep the nuclear reactors, which produce almost no emissions, operating at a time of low prices for power and natural gas, an alternative generator fuel. “The frivolous lawsuit is right out of fossil fuel industry’s play book to deny and thwart actions to combat climate change,” New York PSC Chairwoman Audrey Zibelman said in a statement. She noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the rights of states to protect their environment for the welfare of citizens. The owners of the state’s nuclear reactors include units of Exelon Corp and Entergy Corp. Exelon in August agreed to buy Entergy’s FitzPatrick reactor in New York, which Entergy said it would retire in 2017, after the state adopted the Clean Energy Standard (CES) to help the state’s nuclear reactors. Exelon said in a statement that despite the lawsuit, New York PSC’s work to finalize the CES “and our work to complete the FitzPatrick transaction continues notwithstanding attempts to stop it.” Coalition members opposed to the nuclear subsidies include units of Dynegy Inc and NRG Energy Inc.

195,EXC,GE signs Exelon in its largest power-plant software deal,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) has signed up U.S. energy utility Exelon Corp (EXC.N) to use its full software set to analyze and manage power plants in 48 states, the largest GE deployment in the power sector so far, the companies said on Tuesday. The Exelon deal, aimed at wringing greater efficiency from the business of generating electricity, marks another advance in GE’s effort to lift annual digital technology revenue to $14 billion in 2020 from $5 billion in 2015, across its many industrial products.  It also is one of the three largest sales of GE’s Predix industrial operating system so far. Exelon has nuclear, wind and fossil fuel-powered plants. The companies did not disclose the value of Exelon’s five-year contract with GE.  In initial uses, GE’s technology has increased power plant efficiency by 3 percent and reliability by 5 percent, while cutting operating and maintenance costs 25 percent, said Steve Bolze, chief executive of GE Power. Exelon’s deployment is nearly six times larger than the previous largest GE deal, signed last month with the New York Power Authority and covering 16 power plants in New York state that generate about 5,600 megawatts. Chicago-based Exelon will use GE’s Predix software and applications across its 91 power plants, which produce 32,700 megawatts and supply more than 10 million customers, the companies said. Exelon will also use GE software that analyzes the company’s business performance and profitability, something NYPA didn’t choose, GE said. GE and Exelon also agreed to work together on new Predix-based software applications.  GE’s power business accounts for 40 percent of GE’s digital revenue, said Bolze. About $400 million a year is produced by GE Power’s software business, and that revenue is growing by 50 percent a year, he added. Exelon’s agreement follows four pilot projects over the past year and is GE’s “first and largest IoT (internet of things) enterprise-wide deployment of Predix full-suite offerings anywhere in the world,” Bolze said.

201,EXC,Exelon taps restructuring advisor for power subsidiary - sources,"March 7 (Reuters) - U.S. utility holding company Exelon Corp  has hired a debt restructuring adviser to help it evaluate options for its merchant power plant subsidiary ExGen Texas Power LLC, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. The move comes as merchant power plants such as ExGen Texas Power, which burn fuels such as natural gas to generate electricity and then sell it onto the grid, struggle to cope with massive swings in energy prices. Investment bank PJT Partners Inc will help Exelon address ExGen Texas Power’s cash liquidity concerns and its approximately $650 million in debt, the people said. ExGen Texas Power’s lenders have also organized for a potential debt restructuring by tapping legal and financial counsel, the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Exelon and PJT declined to comment. Peers of Exelon have recently unveiled similar moves. NRG Energy Inc has announced that it is in talks with the bondholders of its GenOn Energy Inc subsidiary on a debt restructuring, while FirstEnergy Corp has said it plans to exit its merchant business by mid-2018. Natural gas prices have been under pressure due to oversupply and warm weather in the northeastern United States, which have driven down electricity prices, in turn hurting power plants’ profits. Increased use of renewable energy has also negatively affected power plants that run on fossil fuels. ExGen Texas Power operates five natural-gas-fired power plants in Texas. Its $675 million term loan that matures in 2021 is trading well below face value, an indication that investors do not expect full repayment. The term loan, used in part to pay a dividend to Exelon, was trading at about 71 cents on the dollar on Monday, the most recent data available, according to Thomson Reuters LPC. ExGen Texas Power also has a $20 million revolving credit line due in 2019, of which $4 million was drawn in January, according to credit ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service. ExGen Texas Power faces a cash crunch in May, Moody’s said in a February report. The credit ratings agency said it does not believe the market value of the power plants would cover the company’s debt in an asset sale.

207,EXC,"RPT-GE's Immelt bets big on digital factories, shareholders are wary"," GROVE CITY, Penn. (Reuters) - At a General Electric Co (GE.N) factory in this rural town, Keith Spahn, 60, used to take measurements of parts from railroad locomotives that are in for repair by hand.  Now he uses a tool that reads the dimensions automatically and sends them wirelessly to his computer, where software decides whether the part can be reused or must be scrapped. “It’s definitely faster,” he says.  Spahn's workbench in this 240,000-square foot plant is one small example of a multibillion-dollar bet by GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt: digital technology will transform GE's factories, generate new revenue and boost profits. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2pDvYUA The $4 billion GE has spent on developing digital products – ranging from tiny sensors in jet engines to augmented reality and software that can crunch large volumes of data - is on the scale of investments Google and Facebook Inc FB.N made to build their businesses, Bill Ruh, CEO of GE’s digital division, told Reuters.  Now that GE has shed non-essential operations, including most of its large financial unit, its fortunes will rise or fall depending on whether that investment delivers.  GE’s technology - and similar systems by IBM, Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) and others - is a hot new battleground in manufacturing. The companies promise they can spot problems before machines break down, yield cost savings of 30 percent or more, and raise labor productivity that has slowed sharply in recent years.  By 2020, spending on such systems is expected to exceed $500 billion a year, up from $20 billion in 2012, according to an estimate cited by consulting firm Accenture. GE says the market for the sectors it is in will be $225 billion by 2020.  The company has spent $5 billion setting up new U.S. factories in the last five years. As it now adds digital technology to its plants, it needs fewer, and higher skilled, workers than in the past.  “We’re going to have a smarter worker,” Immelt said in an interview. “We’re not going to have as many workers.”  But as investment grows, so have concerns about whether these bets will pay off - and about the cost and complexity of keeping networked machines running and secure from hackers.  GE investors are especially impatient for returns. Since Immelt became CEO in 2001, GE shares have fallen 29 percent while the S&P 500 index has more than doubled. GE’s dividend is seven cents lower than it was in 2008. For more on GE’s stock performance, click [L1N1IB0OI]  That performance has some pressing for more urgency from Immelt. When activist investor Nelson Peltz bought a $2.5 billion GE stake in 2015, he pressed for asset sales and cost cutting, and barely mentioned GE’s digital strategy as a source of growth. Trian declined to comment for this article.  In March, Peltz reached an agreement with GE that tied the bonuses of top executives to cutting $2 billion in costs and hitting profit targets through 2017. Those targets don’t rely on GE’s digital strategy.  “People aren’t saying they don’t like the technology” or that GE is investing too much in digital, said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “But how does it translate into profit margins and cash?”  GE poses an important test of the digital factory idea. It has more than 500 factories around the globe that produce jet engines, power plants, medical CT scanners and other large, sophisticated equipment adaptable to the technology.  GE also earns very little from selling hardware. Nearly half of its revenue and most of its profit come from selling services, a natural fit for the monitoring and data analysis that are the core of a computerized factory. In addition to improving its own productivity, GE sells the “Brilliant Factory” as a product, promising a combination of its digital systems with advanced manufacturing techniques, 3-D printing and lean production principles pioneered by Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T).  Take the industrial operating system called Predix. GE spent more than $1 billion to create it along with applications that can analyze terabytes of data from jet engines or factory machines along with other data, such as weather or energy costs.  GE’s venture capital arm is buying stakes in startups that adapt robots, optical scanners and augmented reality to work with Predix. Last year, GE spent $1.1 billion on two makers of industrial 3-D printers, planning both to use the printers and sell them.  Predix systems work, in part, by creating a computerized model, or “digital twin,” of a machine that shows in real time how it is performing, and when parts are wearing out. This can eliminate unplanned breakdowns, GE says, saving time and money.  The system also creates a ""digital thread"" that logs, like a medical record, every aspect of a machine’s life - from initial assembly to repairs during its years of operation.  At GE’s Grove City factory, digital systems that were installed in the last 18 months time workers down to the second. Flat screens over work bays count how long crews are spending and turn red when jobs are taking too long.  “I can look at that screen and see everything I need to know about how things are running,” said Richard Simpson, vice president of supply chain at GE Transportation, pointing to a display.  Even though it is still a grimy, greasy industrial shop, Grove City is one of 17 “showcases” GE plans to have by year-end, helping it sell its systems to outside customers.  When a massive railroad engine rolls in for repair, workers check the digital twin to see what parts need to be fixed. The system ensures spares are in stock. Older engines are fitted with sensors so they can supply that data next time. The process saves labor by eliminating unnecessary work.  “Instead of full tear downs, the factory workers can refurbish just the parts that need it,” said Anup Sharma, a general manager at GE Digital. “That frees them up to do value added work and gets the engine back to the customer sooner.”  GE executives say the company has reaped $1 billion in productivity gains during the last two years, with $700 million more expected in 2017. Those gains are being reinvested into Predix and applications, so they have not had a large effect on GE’s earnings, the executives said. The gains are not broken out for investors to see.  GE’s digital business expects new orders to jump 25 percent to $5 billion this year, said GE digital division CEO Ruh, resulting in $4 billion in revenue for the division from sales to companies such as Exelon Corp (EXC.N) and BP PLC (BP.L).

208,EXC,"RPT--GE's Immelt bets big on digital factories, shareholders are wary","(Repeats to additional customers with no changes to text) By Alwyn Scott GROVE CITY, Penn., May 12 (Reuters) - At a General Electric Co factory in this rural town, Keith Spahn, 60, used to take measurements of parts from railroad locomotives that are in for repair by hand. Now he uses a tool that reads the dimensions automatically and sends them wirelessly to his computer, where software decides whether the part can be reused or must be scrapped. “It’s definitely faster,” he says. Spahn's workbench in this 240,000-square foot plant is one small example of a multibillion-dollar bet by GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt: digital technology will transform GE's factories, generate new revenue and boost profits. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2pDvYUA The $4 billion GE has spent on developing digital products – ranging from tiny sensors in jet engines to augmented reality and software that can crunch large volumes of data - is on the scale of investments Google and Facebook Inc made to build their businesses, Bill Ruh, CEO of GE’s digital division, told Reuters. Now that GE has shed non-essential operations, including most of its large financial unit, its fortunes will rise or fall depending on whether that investment delivers. GE’s technology - and similar systems by IBM, Siemens AG and others - is a hot new battleground in manufacturing. The companies promise they can spot problems before machines break down, yield cost savings of 30 percent or more, and raise labor productivity that has slowed sharply in recent years. By 2020, spending on such systems is expected to exceed $500 billion a year, up from $20 billion in 2012, according to an estimate cited by consulting firm Accenture. GE says the market for the sectors it is in will be $225 billion by 2020. The company has spent $5 billion setting up new U.S. factories in the last five years. As it now adds digital technology to its plants, it needs fewer, and higher skilled, workers than in the past. “We’re going to have a smarter worker,” Immelt said in an interview. “We’re not going to have as many workers.” But as investment grows, so have concerns about whether these bets will pay off - and about the cost and complexity of keeping networked machines running and secure from hackers. GE investors are especially impatient for returns. Since Immelt became CEO in 2001, GE shares have fallen 29 percent while the S&P; 500 index has more than doubled. GE’s dividend is seven cents lower than it was in 2008. For more on GE’s stock performance, click That performance has some pressing for more urgency from Immelt. When activist investor Nelson Peltz bought a $2.5 billion GE stake in 2015, he pressed for asset sales and cost cutting, and barely mentioned GE’s digital strategy as a source of growth. Trian declined to comment for this article. In March, Peltz reached an agreement with GE that tied the bonuses of top executives to cutting $2 billion in costs and hitting profit targets through 2017. Those targets don’t rely on GE’s digital strategy. “People aren’t saying they don’t like the technology” or that GE is investing too much in digital, said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “But how does it translate into profit margins and cash?” GE poses an important test of the digital factory idea. It has more than 500 factories around the globe that produce jet engines, power plants, medical CT scanners and other large, sophisticated equipment adaptable to the technology. GE also earns very little from selling hardware. Nearly half of its revenue and most of its profit come from selling services, a natural fit for the monitoring and data analysis that are the core of a computerized factory. In addition to improving its own productivity, GE sells the “Brilliant Factory” as a product, promising a combination of its digital systems with advanced manufacturing techniques, 3-D printing and lean production principles pioneered by Toyota Motor Corp. Take the industrial operating system called Predix. GE spent more than $1 billion to create it along with applications that can analyze terabytes of data from jet engines or factory machines along with other data, such as weather or energy costs. GE’s venture capital arm is buying stakes in startups that adapt robots, optical scanners and augmented reality to work with Predix. Last year, GE spent $1.1 billion on two makers of industrial 3-D printers, planning both to use the printers and sell them. Predix systems work, in part, by creating a computerized model, or “digital twin,” of a machine that shows in real time how it is performing, and when parts are wearing out. This can eliminate unplanned breakdowns, GE says, saving time and money. The system also creates a “digital thread” that logs, like a medical record, every aspect of a machine’s life - from initial assembly to repairs during its years of operation.

211,EXC,U.S. judge refuses to halt New York nuclear power plant subsidies,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit by energy companies and trade groups to stop New York Governor Andrew Cuomo from providing billions of dollars in subsidies to prop up struggling nuclear power plants in the state. U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni in Manhattan rejected claims that federal law preempted New York and its Public Service Commission from offering credits to promote clean energy and reduce reliance on fossil-fueled or gas plants. The plaintiffs said the credits could boost electric bills for New York’s “captive ratepayers” by $7.6 billion over 12 years, and violate the “dormant” Commerce Clause by impeding Congress’ power to regulate commerce among states. But the judge said New York’s “zero-emissions credits” program was “plainly related to a matter of legitimate state concern”: the production of clean energy, and reduction of emissions from other energy that could add to global warming. “The New York program is constitutional,” Caproni wrote. “Fatal to plaintiffs’ argument is their failure to offer any cogent explanation why ZECs are preempted but other state incentives to generate clean energy - such as tax exemptions, land grants, or direct financial subsidies - are not.” Seven plaintiffs had challenged the credits, including the Coalition for Competitive Electricity, Dynegy Inc DYN.N and NRG Energy Inc (NRG.N). Requests for comment from their lawyers were forwarded to a spokesman for New Yorkers for Fair Energy, (www.ny4fairenergy.com/), who said there will be an appeal. The public service commission “failed ratepayers last year when it instituted a $7.6 billion bailout for uneconomic nuclear plants with almost no public input,” the spokesman said. Cuomo welcomed the decision. “At a time when the federal government has abdicated its leadership on climate change,” the decision “ensures our progress will not be blocked or rolled back by fossil fuel interests and others seeking to maintain the status quo,” Cuomo said in a statement. Audrey Zibelman, in her role as PSC chair, was the lead defendant. Nuclear generators receiving the credits and their owners, including Exelon Corp (EXC.N), also sided with the governor. Cuomo endorsed the subsidies in connection with his “Clean Energy Standard” announced last August, which required that half of New York’s electricity come from renewable energy sources such as wind and solar by 2030. The case is Coalition for Competitive Electricity et al v. Zibelman et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-08164.

218,EXC,UPDATE 2-Exelon to shut N.J. Oyster Creek reactor earlier than planned,"(Adds links, background on U.S. nuclear reactors) Feb 2 (Reuters) - Exelon Corp said on Friday it will shut the Oyster Creek nuclear power plant in New Jersey in October 2018, about a year earlier than planned. In an agreement with New Jersey in 2010, Exelon said it would shut the plant by December 2019 rather than install costly cooling towers to reduce the amount of water it removes from the Barnegat Bay for cooling purposes. Exelon said the earlier closure will allow it to meet that commitment while helping about 500 employees at the plant to find jobs elsewhere in the company as well as manage costs. The company also said the decision will help it better manage resources as fuel and maintenance costs continue to rise amid historically low power prices. The U.S. nuclear industry has been suffering for several years as cheap and abundant natural gas from shale formations has depressed power prices, making it uneconomic for many reactors to continue operating. Over the past five years, U.S. nuclear operators have shut six reactors and plan to shut another six reactors over the next five years. The 99 nuclear reactors operating in the United States provide about 20 percent of the nation’s power. Oyster Creek, located about 60 miles (97 kilometers) east of Philadelphia in Ocean County, New Jersey, is one of the oldest operating reactors in the United States. It entered service in 1969 and is capable of generating about 608 megawatts of power. One megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes.
