1,CSCO,"Cisco could eliminate as many as 10,000 jobs: report","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Networking equipment company Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) could eliminate as many as 10,000 jobs, or about 14 percent of its workforce, to revive profit growth, Bloomberg said, citing two people familiar with the matter.  As many as 7,000 jobs would be eliminated by the end of August, the people told the agency. Cisco is also providing early-retirement packages to about 3,000 workers who took buyouts, according to Bloomberg.  Early on Monday, Reuters reported that Cisco may slash about 5,000 jobs to meet Chief Executive John Chambers’ goal of slashing costs by $1 billion. Reuters had cited Gleacher & Co analyst Brian Marshall.  “As we announced on our Q3 earnings call, Cisco will take out $1 billion in costs from our FY 12 expense run-rate as part of our efforts to streamline company operations, including a planned reduction in workforce. We will provide additional detail on the cost reductions, including layoffs, on our next earnings call on Aug 11,” Cisco spokeswoman Karen Tillman told Reuters.  Cisco shares closed down about 2 percent at $15.43, in a market that was broadly lower due to concerns about the U.S. budget talks and the euro-zone debt crisis.  Chambers, who is set to speak at a company event in Las Vegas on Tuesday, is working to turn around the Silicon Valley bellwether. He has said the company’s next fiscal year starting in August would not live up to the company’s previous growth expectations.  Marshall’s estimate for job cuts at Cisco is higher than the previous forecasts of up to 4,000 jobs that are in danger of being eliminated.  The pending job cuts “will help right the ship” and achieve a reduction in operating expenses by about $1 billion annually, Marshall said in a note to clients.  Cisco would also need to lower its long-term revenue growth target to about 10 percent from a forecast of 12 percent to 17 percent, Marshall said.  Cisco’s revenue has increased 11 percent over the past five calendar years.  Cisco warned in May that it planned to trim its workforce as part of a plan to cut some $1 billion in costs from its annual budget but did not disclose how many jobs would be cut.  Cisco’s previous record layoffs came in 2001, when the company shed some 8,000 jobs, Marshall said.

4,CSCO,"Cisco to cut workforce by 15 percent, sell factory","NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Cisco Systems plans to cut 15 percent of its jobs and sell a factory as part of a plan to cut annual expenses by $1 billion as the network equipment maker tries to revive its fortunes.  The cuts are deeper than what financial analysts expected. The company said on Monday that it will cut 11,500 jobs, compared with the several thousand that analysts predicted.  The cuts come after Cisco’s chief executive John Chambers said in April that the company lost its way.  The company had 73,408 employees as of the end of the last quarter, a spokeswoman said. Cisco will transfer 5,000 to contract manufacturer Foxconn which will buy a Cisco plant in Juarez, Mexico. Of the other 6,500 who are leaving, 2,100 will get early retirement.  “This is a net positive for the company and for investors,” said Morningstar analyst Grady Burkett.  It is also one half of a bigger blow dealt to U.S. companies on Monday. The announcement comes on the same day that Borders Group Inc, the second-largest U.S. bookstore chain, canceled its bankruptcy auction plans and said it would close for good. Nearly 11,000 people will lose their jobs.  Cisco said in May that it would reorganize the company, which has been losing ground in the network equipment business.  “We still need clarity around what different businesses the cuts are coming from, but Cisco has been very vocal about the fact that they are refocusing on their core businesses such as data center, switching and routing,” Burkett said.  The job cuts will result in pre-tax restructuring charges as high as $1.3 billion over several quarters.  Cisco expects to incur about $750 million of the charges in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2011, including $500 million for the early retirement program. It did not say how close the cutbacks would bring it toward its goal of reducing annual costs by $1 billion.  About 15 percent of Cisco executives at the level of vice president and higher will lose their jobs too.  Cisco will notify U.S. and Canada-based employees who are losing their jobs in the first week of August. The layoffs in other countries will take place later than this in compliance with local laws and regulations, Cisco said.  The sale of the Juarez factory, which makes television set-top boxes, is in line with company strategy, said Cisco spokeswoman Karen Tillman. Cisco outsources about 90 percent of its manufacturing to contract manufacturers.  Foxconn, whose flagship unit is Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industries, is best known for being a contract manufacturer of Apple Inc iPhones and iPads. It also makes computer gadgets for other companies such as Hewlett Packard and Dell.  The manufacturer, which employs close to a million workers in China, made headlines last year after reports emerged about poor working conditions at factories in southern China, which critics say may have helped drive several employees to suicide.

Some investors are betting the purchase of the Mexico plant would guarantee orders and bring in strong margins.  “It is not clear about the operation’s scale, but set-top box makers usually get a gross margin of over 10 percent and that is not bad in the tech industry,” said Bevan Yeh, a fund manager at Prudential Financial in Taiwan.

9,CSCO,Analysis: Dell challenges Cisco with networking deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dell Inc’s deal on Wednesday to buy Force10 Networks will give the world’s second-largest computer maker inroads into Cisco Systems Inc’s turf — networking.  Force10 is a data center networking company that makes ethernet switchers and routers, and focuses on serving booming social media companies like Facebook and Zynga as well as giants like Google Inc.  With the acquisition of Force10 at an undisclosed price, Dell is creating a more serious competitor to Cisco, adding to the networking giant’s troubles.  Cisco is already facing intense competition from smaller networking companies like Juniper Networks Inc, Check Point Software Technologies, F5 Networks Inc and Riverbed Technology Inc.  Cisco’s switching business has seen sales fall in recent quarters, and analysts have argued the company has stretched itself too thin by making several large acquisitions in the consumer market, causing it to lose focus of its core switching and routing businesses.  Force10, which generated about $50 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2011, has an edge over competitors.  Cisco, Juniper and Brocade Communications Systems Inc all provide switching and routing technology, although very few like Force10 have the technological capability that creates the backbone of the major data centers, sources said.  Cisco declined to comment.  The deal also means that Dell is no longer interested in buying networking equipment supplier Brocade, whose market capitalization is $2.8 billion, sources said. Dell was reported to be eyeing Brocade as well.  Over the past three years Dell has expanded its enterprise portfolio through acquisitions to include server and storage services.  In May, Dave Johnson, Dell’s senior vice president of corporate strategy, told Reuters that it will continue to seek companies with valuations in the $1 billion to $5 billion range.  Dell was advised by Evercore Partners on the Force10 deal. The transaction was the first for technology investment banker Eric Mandl at his new firm. Tor Braham, head of technology M&A at Deutsche Bank, led the deal for Force10.  Force10’s decision to sell to Dell is the latest in a string of private technology companies in the sector that are opting to sell rather than go public, as tech giants looking to build a broader suite of services swoop in with rich offers.  Force10 had filed its initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year.  But in 2011, the company started discussions with a few interested parties over a sale, one source said.  Other companies that have in recent months opted to sell rather than go public include Internet video conferencing service Skype, which sold to Microsoft Corp for $8.5 billion, and Web hosting company Go Daddy which sold itself to a private equity consortium led by KKR and Silver Lake this month for $2.25 billion.

10,CSCO,Strong foreign demand drives U.S. manufacturers,"BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Strong demand from emerging markets is driving profit growth for U.S. manufacturers this year, but executives do not expect that to be much of a lift for the sluggish U.S. economy.  In fact, a top executive at United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) attributed the 18.9 percent rise in profit at the world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners partly to the company’s ability to hold the line on hiring.  “We’ve driven all this cost out. Sales have come back, but people have not,” said Greg Hayes, chief financial officer at the Hartford, Connecticut-based company. “It’s the structural cost reductions that we have done over the past few years that have allowed us to see strong bottom-line results.  While the company is adding some engineers in the United States, it is doing most of its hiring right now in emerging markets where demand for its products is growing.  “Until you see a big resurgence in consumer spending in the United States, I don’t think you’re going to see a big improvement in the employment picture,” Hayes said.  Stubbornly high unemployment — which has held between 9 and 10 percent for most of the past two years — stands as one of the top problems facing the U.S. economy and is shaping up as a key issue in next year’s presidential election.  Big U.S. employers continue to cut. This week, Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) said they would cut some 18,000 workers from their payrolls.  Big companies such as United Tech and Textron Inc (TXT.N), which also reported better-than-expected profit on Wednesday, have turned more of their focus overseas to markets where demand is growing, investors said.  “Domestic uncertainty is not holding back Carrier and Otis segments internationally,” said Tim Hoyle, the director of research at Haverford Quality Investing, referring to United Tech’s air-conditioning and elevator units.  “Growth in emerging markets’ airlines (helps) Pratt & Whitney,” added Hoyle, whose Radnor, Pennsylvania-based company manages more than $6 billion and holds United Tech shares.  United Tech posted earnings that came in 4 cents per share ahead of analysts’ forecasts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, and raised its full-year forecast for the third time since December.  TE Connectivity Ltd (TEL.N), a U.S. maker of electronic connectors previously known as Tyco Electronics, also posted better-than-expected results, saying that telecommunications companies in Australia, China and Europe are making big investments in broadband networks outside the United States, driving demand for its products.  “These companies have been exhibiting really strong profitability in a very difficult economic environment,” said Catherine Maniscalco Avery, president and CEO of CAIM LLC, which invests in dividend-paying stocks.  Makers of aircraft, engines and aviation components got a big boost on Wednesday when No. 3 U.S. airline American Airlines, owned by AMR Corp AMR.N, unveiled a $40 billion order for at least 460 narrowbody jets from Boeing Co (BA.N) and Airbus EAD.PA running from 2013 through 2022.  That news could provide a long-term lift for companies, including United Tech, as well as General Electric Co (GE.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), which make aviation components and are due to report results on Friday.  Boeing offered a new engine on the 737 — the LEAP-X, produced by an alliance of GE and France’s Safran SA (SAF.PA) — to clinch the order and avoid losing more ground to archrival Airbus. Investors fretted the move, which came after Boeing considered entirely redesigning the 737, boxed United Tech’s Pratt & Whitney arm out of that side of the deal.  “Go back a few months ago and the expectation was Boeing would go with an all-new plane and keep Pratt in the running,” said Matt Collins, a capital goods analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. “I think this AMR situation forced their hand.”  United Tech shares were down 3 percent at $86.14 at midday on the New York Stock Exchange.  Demand for corporate jets, which has been slow to recover since a precipitous drop during the financial crisis, is starting to show signs of turning, said the head of Textron, which is the world’s largest maker of business jets.  “We expect a significant pick-up in demand in the second half of the year, similar to what we saw last year,” said Scott Donnelly, chief executive of Textron, which also topped analysts’ forecasts, but held its full-year forecast steady.  Textron shares were up 9 percent at $24.09 and TE Connectivity was up 1.6 percent at $35.93. Both trade on the NYSE.

Shares in Bangalore-based Wipro, which also makes computer hardware, electric bulbs, soaps and toiletries, dropped nearly 5 percent on the disappointing outlook despite the firm posting forecast-beating fiscal first quarter net profit.	   IBM and Accenture , who compete with Indian services providers such as Tata Consultancy Services  Infosys and Wipro, raised their annual earnings forecasts earlier this month after quarterly results beat Wall Street estimates.	   Growth in India’s $76 billion software services sector has slowed down in recent quarters due to global economic uncertainty, severe competition, rising wages, high staff turnover rates and management shakeups at Infosys and Wipro.	   The rupee’s rise against the dollar is another concern for the export-driven outsourcing sector, which exports a large chunk of its services to the United States but chalks up expenses in rupees.	   “Apart from the global economy, wage hikes and attrition are additional challenges that IT firms will have to continue to grapple with,” said Kaushik Dani, a fund manager with Peerless Mutual Fund, which owns Infosys and Tata Consultancy shares.	   No. 2 software services provider Infosys last week reported quarterly profit that missed expectations and warned it could face slow client spending, while Tata Consultancy  flagged concerns about economic uncertainty. 	   Wipro has been struggling to keep up with TCS and Infosys in winning large outsourcing contracts and reorganised its management earlier this year to boost growth.	   Wipro in January surprised markets by removing the joint chiefs of the business and naming company veteran Kurien as the new chief executive. Later, it reorganised business units under the IT services and named new unit heads.	   Wipro Chief Executive T.K. Kurien said the company, which gets three-quarters of its revenue from IT services, would see a positive impact of the management restructuring after couple of quarters and that would be sustained in the longer term.	   “You can put lipstick on a pig and make it look good...but it is never going to be sustainable until and unless you go back to the core of the business and change the quality of the revenue,” he said in a television interview.	   The company forecast revenue from its IT services unit at $1.44 billion to $1.46 billion in the fiscal second quarter to end-September, indicating a rise of 2.1 to 3.5 percent from the first quarter.	   Analysts had expected at least a 4 percent sequential rise in IT services revenue forecast.	   “Given that this quarter is a seasonally strong quarter for the Indian IT sector, Wipro’s growth forecast is decent but not outstanding,” said Rohit Anand, a sector analyst with Mumbai-based PINC Research.	   Wipro shares, which the market values at about $23 billion, were trading down 4.6 percent at 396.15 rupees by 0810 GMT, on course to post their biggest drop in more than three months. The Mumbai market was down 0.5 percent.   	   Azim Premji, Wipro’s billionaire chairman, said the uncertain economic environment had resulted in volatility in business, but the company was not seeing delays in the IT spending decision making process by customers.	   “Customers are preparing for a longer period of uncertainty and are looking for new avenues to grow their business,” said Premji, who had quit engineering degree at Stanford to take over his father’s ailing vegetable oil business in the mid-1960s.  	   He diversified the vegetable oil business into hydraulic cylinders in the 1970s and software services in 1980.	   Wipro said IT services revenue rose 0.5 percent in April-June to $1.41 billion from the quarter ago. Anand of PINC Research said he had  expected the company to report more than 1 percent rise.	   Wipro, which develops software applications, integrates IT systems and manages call centres, said consolidated net profit rose 1.2 percent to 13.35 billion rupees ($300 million) in the June quarter from 13.19 billion a year ago.	   Revenue rose 18 percent to 85.64 billion rupees, as it added 49 new clients in the quarter and western clients increased spending on outsourced services to cut costs and boost efficiency amid global economic uncertainty.	   This compares with a Reuters poll forecast of a profit of 13.16 billion rupees on revenue of 83.91 billion rupees for Wipro, which counts Citigroup , Cisco and Credit Suisse among its clients.	   Wipro increased its IT services staff by 4,105 employees in the quarter to 126,490.	   Still, the rate of attrition at Wipro was higher than rivals, rising to 23.2 percent despite 12-15 percent wage hikes.	   Operating margins at its IT services business fell to 22 percent from 24.5 percent in year-ago period and Wipro said margins in this quarter would remain under pressure.	   Wipro revenue growth in this fiscal year to March 2012 might be lower than the outsourcing sector’s 16-18 percent growth, but the company does not see pressure on prices for its services in the coming quarters, Chief Financial Officer Suresh Senapaty said.

On Wednesday, the company’s European rival Logitech acquired Italian firm Mirial to cash in on the growing demand for mobile video services, raising concerns that the Microsoft-Skype deal will take away from the market share that Polycom is winning from Cisco.	   Cisco recently said it would cut workforce by 15 percent and sell a set-top box unit. Earlier, in April, CEO John Chambers had admitted that the company has lost its way and outlined a plan to revive growth, including a focus on the video market.   	   The company has been benefiting from strong demand in emerging markets like India, China and Brazil. It also saw its federal business pick up in the second quarter.	   Polycom, which has been reporting market-beating or inline results for the last eight quarters, reported second-quarter net income that more than doubled to $28.5 million, or 16 cents a share — all figures adjusted for the two-for-one stock split in June.	   Excluding items, the company earned 26 cents a share., beating analysts’ expectations of 25 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.	   Revenue jumped almost 25 percent to $365.6 million. Analysts were expecting revenue of $362.9 million.	   Last month, it bought Hewlett Packard’s videoconferencing business for $89 million to expand into the high-growth desktop and mobile video conferencing market, helping it balance its traditionally dedicated terminal-heavy business. 	   Shares of the Pleasanton, California-based company that closed down 6.5 percent at $28.93 in heavy trading, fell a further 8 percent to $26.70 in trading after the bell.	   The stock has fallen 10 percent since the Logitech news on Wednesday. It rose 24 percent since Polycom reported first-quarter results on April 21, excluding the latest 2-day fall.

TORONTO, July 22 (Reuters) - Celestica Inc (CLS.TO) (CLS.N) said on Friday its quarterly profit more than tripled as new business awards pushed revenue higher, and shares of the contract electronics manufacturer rose as much as 10 percent.   Profit rose to $45.7 million, or 21 cents a share, in the second quarter, compared with $13 million, or 6 cents a share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis it earned 27 cents per share.   “New business awards from 2010 are contributing to our revenue growth and operating margins are benefiting from a favorable revenue mix and higher operating efficiencies from recently ramped programs,” Chief Executive Craig Muhlhauser said in a release.   The company expects sales of $1.8 billion in the current quarter, give or take $75 million, and adjusted net earnings between 23 cents to 29 cents a share.   The Canadian-based company said an uncertain global economic climate was continuing to have an impact on customer demand.   Revenue for the company, whose top customers include IBM (IBM.N) and Cisco (CSCO.O), rose to $1.83 billion from $1.59 billion in the year earlier.   Chief Financial Officer Paul Nicoletti said during a conference call that the company will meet its target of 10 to 15 percent revenue growth in 2011.   But Celestica completed its acquisition of a contract manufacturing unit from Brooks Automation (BRKS.O) in the second quarter, and that unit’s contribution to revenue had not been included in the original target.   “One of our largest customers has commented that overall they do expect volumes to be down, so it’s safe to say that we are seeing an impact there,” said Nicoletti, without specifying the customer.   The company’s shares hit a two-year low in June after Research In Motion, RIM.TO one major customer, reported disappointing results and provided a dismal outlook.   First-quarter earnings reflected smaller-than-expected orders from Oracle, whose purchase of Sun Microsystems last year brought new server business to Celestica.   Celestica shares rose 14.1 percent early on Thursday to C$9.17 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and 13.3 percent to $9.65 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Bain manages the information technology investment arm of Atlanta-based Silvant Capital Management, which had total assets under management of $4.1 billion, as of March 31. He directly manages about $1 billion.	   “It is very important to know what your end markets are and play companies that have themes that are taking share or have new product introductions, and that’s why we own Juniper Networks over Cisco Systems Inc ,” Bain said.	   The fund manager has loaded up on hardware stocks such as Juniper and F5 Networks , as the demand for enterprise storage and mobile computing grows, but would stay away from stocks like HP and Cisco — given their reorganization concerns.	   He said the transition period for these companies will be longer than expected and their growth prospects are not as bright as that of his top picks Juniper and F5.	   Also among his top picks is China’s search engine Baidu Inc  .	   “I think the growth rates there are very attractive and it is a very underpenetrated market,” Bain said.	   According to a report by the Beijing-based market research firm Analysis International, Baidu controlled more than 75 percent of China’s online-search market in the second quarter, with Google coming a far second at 19 percent.	   Silvant Capital manages four funds: small cap, large cap growth, select large cap growth and a legacy fund.	   “Small is probably outperforming by 250 basis points while large cap is outperforming by 100-120 basis points,” Bain said.	   Given a million dollars to buy a stock he doesn’t own yet, Bain would pick up data analytic software makers such as Terradata , Tibco Software or Informatica Corp  , because of their high growth rate.	   However, he would stay away from social media stocks such as LinkedIn or Facebook, whose IPO is scheduled for early next year.	   “They are expensive stocks... we participated in the LinkedIn IPO, but I think social will get saturated at some point,” the fund manager said.	   Bain is also cautious about optical networking stocks such as Finisar Corp or JDS Uniphase .	   “The secular story there will play out, but it is taking longer than what people had expected.”	   He does not expect their inventory issues and continued slowdown in demand from telecom customers, such as China’s Huawei Technologies Co , sorting out in the near term.

19,CSCO,Insight: Microsoft use of low-tax havens drives down tax bill,"FAIRFIELD, Connecticut (Reuters) - If you want to know why tax from surging corporate profits isn’t making much of a dent in the United States’ crippling budget deficit, a glance at Microsoft Corp’s recent results provides some clues.  Things were rosy in the giant software company’s just-ended fiscal fourth quarter, which produced record sales of nearly $17.4 billion, a 30 percent increase in after-tax profit, and a 35 percent gain in earnings per share.  But for the Internal Revenue Service and foreign tax authorities, things weren’t so rosy. Microsoft reported only $445 million in taxes in the U.S. and other foreign countries, just 7 percent of its $6.32 billion in pre-tax profit.  Given the rancor in Congress and in the country about how to tackle the nation’s budget deficit and debt, including how companies stash profits overseas and enjoy lucrative tax breaks, it is instructive to see how the top brass at Microsoft’s Redmond, Washington, headquarters achieved this eye-popping tax result.  Partly it was because the company had a one-time refund of $461 million from the IRS for previous overpayments and because of its over-estimation of tax rates in previous quarters. There may be increased sales of products to consumers overseas, though it is not clear from company disclosures how much of a factor this might be.  But Microsoft is straightforward about the core reason for its lower tax bill: It is increasingly channeling earnings from sales to customers throughout the world through the low-tax havens of Ireland, Puerto Rico and Singapore.  Microsoft’s pre-tax profits booked overseas nearly tripled over the past six years, to $19.2 billion in the fiscal year that just ended, from $6.8 billion in the year ended in June 2006, according to company filings. By contrast, its U.S. earnings have dropped, to $8.9 billion from $11.4 billion in the same period. Foreign earnings now make up 68 percent of overall income.  The change is fueling its shrinking tax bills. According to its 2010 annual report, by keeping a good chunk of foreign earnings away from the U.S., Microsoft has accumulated $29.5 billion overseas — and that is before the impact of its last financial year.  In theory, the company has saved $9.2 billion in U.S. federal taxes on that figure, though if it brought the entire $29.5 billion back home tomorrow its tax bill would be lower because of credits for foreign taxes paid and other U.S. deductions.  Microsoft’s effective worldwide tax rate fell to 17.5 percent in the last fiscal year, down from 25 percent the previous year and 31 percent in the year to June 30, 2006. The company said it expects to owe tax at an effective rate in the next year of between 19 percent and 22 percent.  Few companies, including Thomson Reuters, pay the standard U.S. corporate rate of 35 percent thanks to loopholes and deductions but the Microsoft tax rate is still at the low end when compared with other large technology companies.  In their last reported fiscal years, Google Inc’s effective tax rate was 21 percent, Apple Inc’s 24 pct, and IBM’s was 25 percent.  Concern about the use of tax-reducing measures now used by many major U.S. corporations has been a big issue for President Obama and the Democrats as they race to hammer out a deal with Republicans by August 2 that would allow the United States to avert imminent default on its debt.  Some Congressional leaders are calling for a “repatriation holiday” that would allow corporations to bring back money held offshore at a lower rate of 5.25 percent, similar to a one-off deal in 2005 through which corporations brought back $312 billion.  Nearly $1.2 trillion of accumulated U.S. corporate profits, are now held in overseas subsidiaries.  The U.S. government taxes U.S. businesses on income earned worldwide but allows them to defer taxes on the money until brought back to the U.S., so corporations like to keep the money abroad, particularly as they increase investment overseas. Critics argue the U.S. system also encourages businesses to move jobs overseas at a time of high unemployment — now at a 9.2 percent rate — in the U.S.  Obama and the Treasury Department oppose a “repatriation holiday” while Microsoft, along with other multinationals, including Apple, Cisco Systems and Pfizer Inc, backs the repatriation idea, through Win America, a Washington, D.C., lobbying group.  Most industrialized nations tax businesses only on income earned within their borders. U.S. corporations argue the U.S. worldwide system is anti-competitive and forces money overseas.  But critics such as Richard Murphy of Tax Research LLP, an anti-poverty and tax research firm based in Britain, argue the U.S. system allows companies to park profits in places where the tax obligation largely disappears. He called Microsoft “a giant tax-planning exercise.”  Microsoft said its lower taxes in the recent quarter were “primarily due to a higher mix of earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore and Puerto Rico, which are subject to lower income tax rates.”  The details of precisely how it does this have not been disclosed.  U.S. companies do not have to break out earnings in foreign subsidiaries, making it hard to determine from financial filings how much tax they are saving through each jurisdiction. “We’re in the land of guesswork here,” said Professor James Hines Jr., a tax scholar at the University of Michigan.  What is clear is Microsoft’s increasingly sophisticated use of the havens. Foreign earnings taxed at lower rates reduced Microsoft’s U.S. rate by 16.3 percentage points to 18.7 percent, for the just-ended year. That compares with a lowering by just 4.6 percentage points to 30.4 percent in 2006, according to SEC. filings.  Ireland taxes corporate profits at 12.5 percent. Singapore taxes them at anywhere from 0 percent to 17 percent. Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory but a foreign country in the eyes of the IRS, offers U.S. multinationals an unusual credit for taxes paid there as well as tax credits for production.  Microsoft operates a 123,000 square-foot factory in Puerto Rico that makes up to 80 million disks a year for sale in the Americas, according to its Spanish-language website — its only company-owned plant in the world.  A Microsoft spokeswoman declined to answer questions on how it records revenue and earnings in certain jurisdictions, adding, “Microsoft complies with the tax laws of every jurisdiction in which we do business.”  Legislation introduced this month by Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, would require large U.S. corporations to report results country-by-country.  The Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year asked the company to do the same, citing what it called the “disproportionate relationships among domestic and foreign revenues, pre-tax income and tax rates.”  Microsoft told the SEC it would supply additional information in future filings. The company says it will provide the requested information in its 2011 annual 10K financial report due to be filed on Thursday.  By finding ways to minimize its taxes, Microsoft can argue that it is only behaving in the interests of its shareholders.  Shifting income to low-tax jurisdictions “is not illegal,” said Robert Willens, a tax and accounting expert in New York. “It behooves companies to do this.”  ",7272011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-tax/insight-microsoft-use-of-low-tax-havens-drives-down-tax-bill-idUSTRE76Q6OB20110727

But critics such as Richard Murphy of Tax Research LLP, an anti-poverty and tax research firm based in Britain, argue the U.S. system allows companies to park profits in places where the tax obligation largely disappears. He called Microsoft “a giant tax-planning exercise.”   LOWER RATES ABROAD                                           Microsoft said its lower taxes in the recent quarter were “primarily due to a higher mix of earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore and Puerto Rico, which are subject to lower income tax rates.”   The details of precisely how it does this have not been disclosed.   U.S. companies do not have to break out earnings in foreign subsidiaries, making it hard to determine from financial filings how much tax they are saving through each jurisdiction. “We’re in the land of guesswork here,” said Professor James Hines Jr., a tax scholar at the University of Michigan.   What is clear is Microsoft’s increasingly sophisticated use of the havens. Foreign earnings taxed at lower rates reduced Microsoft’s U.S. rate by 16.3 percentage points to 18.7 percent, for the just-ended year. That compares with a lowering by just 4.6 percentage points to 30.4 percent in 2006, according to SEC. filings.   Ireland taxes corporate profits at 12.5 percent. Singapore taxes them at anywhere from 0 percent to 17 percent. Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory but a foreign country in the eyes of the IRS, offers U.S. multinationals an unusual credit for taxes paid there as well as tax credits for production.   Microsoft operates a 123,000 square-foot factory in Puerto Rico that makes up to 80 million disks a year for sale in the Americas, according to its Spanish-language website — its only company-owned plant in the world.   A Microsoft spokeswoman declined to answer questions on how it records revenue and earnings in certain jurisdictions, adding, “Microsoft complies with the tax laws of every jurisdiction in which we do business.”   Legislation introduced this month by Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, would require large U.S. corporations to report results country-by-country.   The Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year asked the company to do the same, citing what it called the “disproportionate relationships among domestic and foreign revenues, pre-tax income and tax rates.”   Microsoft told the SEC it would supply additional information in future filings. The company says it will provide the requested information in its 2011 annual 10K financial report due to be filed on Thursday.   By finding ways to minimize its taxes, Microsoft can argue that it is only behaving in the interests of its shareholders.   Shifting income to low-tax jurisdictions “is not illegal,” said Robert Willens, a tax and accounting expert in New York. “It behooves companies to do this.”  ",7272011,http://www.reuters.com/article/microsoft-tax/insight-microsoft-use-of-low-tax-havens-drives-down-tax-bill-idUSN1E76P22A20110727

25,CSCO,Microsoft use of low-tax havens drives down tax bill,"FAIRFIELD, Connecticut (Reuters) - If you want to know why tax from surging corporate profits isn’t making much of a dent in the United States’ crippling budget deficit, a glance at Microsoft Corp’s recent results provides some clues.  Things were rosy in the giant software company’s just-ended fiscal fourth quarter, which produced record sales of nearly $17.4 billion, a 30 percent increase in after-tax profit, and a 35 percent gain in earnings per share.  But for the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and foreign tax authorities, things weren’t so rosy. Microsoft reported only $445 million in taxes in the U.S. and other foreign countries, just 7 percent of its $6.32 billion in pre-tax profit.  Given the rancor in Congress and in the country about how to tackle the nation’s budget deficit and debt, including how companies stash profits overseas and enjoy lucrative tax breaks, it is instructive to see how the top brass at Microsoft’s Redmond, Washington, headquarters achieved this eye-popping tax result.  Partly it was because the company had a one-time refund of $461 million from the IRS for previous overpayments and because of its over-estimation of tax rates in previous quarters. There may be increased sales of products to consumers overseas, though it is not clear from company disclosures how much of a factor this might be.  But Microsoft is straightforward about the core reason for its lower tax bill: It is increasingly channeling earnings from sales to customers throughout the world through the low-tax havens of Ireland, Puerto Rico and Singapore.  Microsoft’s pre-tax profits booked overseas nearly tripled over the past six years, to $19.2 billion in the fiscal year that just ended, from $6.8 billion in the year ended in June 2006, according to company filings. By contrast, its U.S. earnings have dropped, to $8.9 billion from $11.4 billion in the same period. Foreign earnings now make up 68 percent of overall income.  The change is fueling its shrinking tax bills. According to its 2010 annual report, by keeping a good chunk of foreign earnings away from the U.S., Microsoft has accumulated $29.5 billion overseas — and that is before the impact of its last financial year.  In theory, the company has saved $9.2 billion in U.S. federal taxes on that figure, though if it brought the entire $29.5 billion back home tomorrow its tax bill would be lower because of credits for foreign taxes paid and other U.S. deductions.  Microsoft’s effective worldwide tax rate fell to 17.5 percent in the last fiscal year, down from 25 percent the previous year and 31 percent in the year to June 30, 2006. The company said it expects to owe tax at an effective rate in the next year of between 19 percent and 22 percent.  Few companies, including Thomson Reuters, pay the standard U.S. corporate rate of 35 percent thanks to loopholes and deductions but the Microsoft tax rate is still at the low end when compared with other large technology companies.  In their last reported fiscal years, Google Inc’s (GOOG.O) effective tax rate was 21 percent, Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) 24 pct, and IBM’s (IBM.N) was 25 percent.  Concern about the use of tax-reducing measures now used by many major U.S. corporations has been a big issue for President Obama and the Democrats as they race to hammer out a deal with Republicans by August 2 that would allow the United States to avert imminent default on its debt.  Some Congressional leaders are calling for a “repatriation holiday” that would allow corporations to bring back money held offshore at a lower rate of 5.25 percent, similar to a one-off deal in 2005 through which corporations brought back $312 billion.  Nearly $1.2 trillion of accumulated U.S. corporate profits, are now held in overseas subsidiaries.  The U.S. government taxes U.S. businesses on income earned worldwide but allows them to defer taxes on the money until brought back to the U.S., so corporations like to keep the money abroad, particularly as they increase investment overseas. Critics argue the U.S. system also encourages businesses to move jobs overseas at a time of high unemployment — now at a 9.2 percent rate — in the U.S.  Obama and the Treasury Department oppose a “repatriation holiday” while Microsoft, along with other multinationals, including Apple, Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), backs the repatriation idea, through Win America, a Washington, D.C., lobbying group.

The group, which competes with market leaders Ericsson and China’s Huawei [HWT.UL], nevertheless confirmed its annual goals of outgrowing the market, hitting an operating margin of above 5 percent and being free cash flow positive.   The disappointing second quarter comes after Alcatel-Lucent started the year strongly by riding a wave of operator spending in the United States. [ID:nLDE7441QL]   It also comes amid increasing investor jitters about a possible second-half slowdown in the telecom gear sector, especially in the United States.

Alcatel-Lucent CEO Ben Verwaayen downplayed concerns of an United States slowdown, saying he expected sales there to continue to be strong in the second half of the year.    “We have a very broad product base in the United States and many customers there,” he said. “We are on track on our goals for the year and are growing where the market is growing.”   Revenue in the second quarter was up 2.4 percent to 3.9 billion euros ($5.6 billion) compared with a year earlier, and adjusted operating income was 108 million.   Revenue was largely in line with analysts’ average expectation of 4 billion euros, but adjusted operating profit was considerably below consensus of 145 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.        The company also posted a net profit of 43 million euros this quarter after a loss last year.   Alexander Peterc, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said the top-line results were a bit weak and adjusted operating profit well below consensus, despite strong sales in the United States and Asia.   “The targets for the year are still in reach,” said Peterc. “We are not in the danger zone yet, but the second half has to go well and the macroeconomic environment isn’t great.”    Alcatel-Lucent has been riding a wave of investments by U.S. operators in like AT&T and Verizon this year, boosting its results and leading some investors to bet that Verwaayen has gotten the company on the right track after a painful merger.   Before today’s results, Alcatel-Lucent’s shares were up around 55 percent this year, compares with Ericsson’s 10 percent rise.   At 9:13 GMT, shares in Alcatel-Lucent were down 9 percent to 3.07 euros per share, compared with an 1.7 percent drop in the European sector .SX8P.   Alcatel-Lucent has better margins in the U.S. market because it is effectively closed to low-cost Chinese vendors like Huawei and ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) who have been kept out of major operators’ networks over security concerns.   Sales in North America in the second quarter were up 4.4 percent to 1.55 billion euros.    In the second half, Alcatel-Lucent will likely be hurt by Verizon’s plan to dial back spending on its wireless network, but helped by AT&T’s plan to increase investments by a billion dollars and Sprint’s buildout, said analyst Alexander Peterc.   But even strong sales in the U.S. may not resolve Alcatel-Lucent’s long-standing problem of cash burn. The company saw free cash flow of negative 350 million in the second quarter, and negative 213 million in the first quarter.   Nevertheless, Chief Financial Officer Paul Tufano said the company remained “very committed” to its goal of reaching positive free cash flow goal for 2011.    “We made modest progress in reducing inventory and expect to accelerate that in second half,” he said. “We remain very focused on making that target.”   Alcatel-Lucent is mulling the sale of its enterprise business, which could bring in around $1 billion, but Verwaayen declined to comment on when a decision would be made.

28,CSCO,PRESS DIGEST - Wall Street Journal - July 28," July 28 (Reuters) - The following were the top stories in The Wall Street Journal on Thursday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.	   * Groupon Inc. has attracted scrutiny from regulators over a newfangled accounting metric it is using to market itself to investors ahead of its initial public offering, said a person familiar with the situation.	   * In the last decade, ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Jim Mulva achieved a feat with few equals in modern U.S. corporate history: creating a new oil major, almost from scratch. Now, as he prepares to retire next year, Mulva is presiding over the disintegration of his signature achievement-selling assets and splitting Conoco into two publicly traded companies, a move disclosed earlier this month and projected to be completed in the first half of 2012.	   * Juniper Networks Inc offered some new clues that the U.S. economy is stalling, warning of slowing sales growth that sent its stock plunging 21 percent in trading Wednesday. As a key player in the Internet networking business, Juniper and larger rival Cisco Systems Inc are regarded as bellwethers of how companies and governments invest in new technology and workers.	   * The debt stalemate in Washington is creating stress in a little-known but vital corner of the bond market, increasing the risk that banks, hedge funds and other investors will have to pay billions of dollars in additional costs if the U.S. defaults or is downgraded.	   * Miller, an oil-industry veteran from Pennsylvania, is one of a small band of pioneers seeking to replicate North America’s shale-gas boom in Europe. His company, Cuadrilla Resources, has imported a technology used to great effect in the U.S. to try to turn Blackpool, a seaside resort on the west coast of England, into a new Klondike for gas.	   * U.S. fuel economy standards would double by 2025 under a deal the White House announced Wednesday with auto makers and environmentalists. If upheld, the plan would lead to the biggest gains in fuel economy since government began setting mileage regulations in the 1970s and could lead to substantial changes to the cars and trucks most Americans drive.	   * The federal regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on Wednesday sued UBS AG , accusing the Swiss investment bank of costing the two mortgage giants at least $900 million by selling them shaky mortgage-backed securities during the housing market boom.	   * More small companies-already struggling with weak sales and tight lending-are being forced to rely on business credit cards to provide working capital. Many of these cards are subject to unannounced rate changes, unrestricted penalties and other terms that were banned from consumer cards in the wake of the financial crisis.

In China itself, surging blue collar wages and production costs, along with the inability of many firms to wrest higher prices from hard-bargaining global clients, has led to razor-thin margins, which some companies cannot survive on for long.	   After a 30 percent rise last year, growth in the global outsourced manufacturing industry is expected to slow to 11-12 percent this year on anaemic Western demand, surging wages and rising prices for base metals such as copper, research firm IHS iSuppli said in a note.

Even Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry , the world’s largest electronics contract manufacturer with around a third of the global market, has struggled.

33,CSCO,UPDATE 3-Foxconn to rely more on robots; could use 1 mln in 3 yrs," * Company to use 1 million robots within 3 years - newspaper   * Robots to replace workers on simple tasks   * Automation comes as labour costs rise in China   * Shares of listed units rise sharply   (Edits)	   By Lee Chyen Yee and Clare Jim	   HONG KONG/TAIPEI, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Taiwan’s Foxconn Technology Group, known for assembling Apple’s iPhones and iPads in China, plans to use more robots, with one report saying the company will use one million of them in the next three years, to cope with rising labour costs.	   Foxconn’s move highlights an increasing trend towards automation among Chinese companies as labour issues such as high-profile strikes and workers’ suicides plague firms in sectors from autos to technology.	   Contract manufacturers such as Foxconn, which also counts Dell , Hewlett-Packard and Nokia  among its clients, are moving parts of their manufacturing to inland Chinese cities or other emerging markets.	   They are also boosting research and development investments to lift their thin margins.	   “Workers’ wages are increasing so quickly that some companies can’t take it longer,” said Dan Bin, a fund manager at Shenzhen-based Eastern Bay Investment Management, which invests in technology and consumer-related shares in China and Hong Kong.	   “Automation is a general trend in many sectors in China, such as electronics. Of course some companies will consider moving their manufacturing overseas, but it’s easier said than done when the supply chain is here.”	   The China Business News on Monday quoted Foxconn   Chairman Terry Gou as saying the company planned to use 1 million robots within three years, up from about 10,000 robots in use now and an expected 300,000 next year.	   Foxconn, whose listed units include Hon Hai Precision  and Foxconn International Holdings Ltd , issued a statement later saying Gou told staff at its campus in Longhua, China, that he planned to move its more than 1 million employees up the value chain beyond basic manufacturing work.	   Foxconn, which has been plagued by a spate of workers’ suicides in its Chinese factories since last year, plans to use the robots for simple assembly line procedures, the statement quoted its chairman Gou as saying.	   Since last year, China has been struck by a series of labour-related issues, such as high-profile strikes and suicide cases at well-known companies as heady economic growth fuelled the need for wage increases.	   In southern China, auto and parts factories owned by Japan’s Honda Motor and Toyota Motor went on strike.	   “Rising salary costs should be the key reason why Foxconn is doing this. This year’s wage increase has been quite significant and I don’t expect the pace to slow down next year,” said C.K. Lu, a Taipei-based senior analyst at research firm Gartner.	   “If they don’t do this, they will have to move their factories elsewhere.”	   At Foxconn, a worker fell to his death last month at a manufacturing plant in southern China, local media reported.	   The worker’s death was the latest in a series of apparent suicides by young migrant workers at its factory complexes in the past two years. 	   Foxconn employs about 1.2 million workers, one million of which are based in mainland China, the China Business News said.	   “The use of automation is driven by Foxconn’s desire to move workers from more routine tasks to more value-added positions in manufacturing such as R&D, innovation and other areas that are equally important to the success of our operations,” Foxconn said.	   Foxconn plans to buy a set-top plant in Mexico from Cisco Systems and is looking into investing more in Brazil, where it is already making mobile phone handsets.	   It has bought LCD TV plants from Japan’s Sony Corp  in Mexico in 2009 and Slovakia in 2010 and is in cooperation talks with a number of top Japanese hi-tech firms, including Sharp , Canon and Hitachi .	   On Monday, Hon Hai Precision’s Taiwan shares rise 3.3 percent, while Foxconn’s cellphone maker unit Foxconn International’s Hong Kong shares ended up 4.3 percent.	   Shares of another of the group’s unit, Foxonn Technology Holdings Ltd , which mainly makes casings, jumped 6.8 percent.

The high-profile spate of hirings dealt a blow to Juniper, long considered one of Cisco’s more formidable foes. Cisco itself is grappling with a major overhaul of its own as it tries to revive flagging growth.   Shares in Juniper, which counts AT&T Inc (T.N), Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and Japan’s NTT DoCoMo (9437.T) among its customers, plunged more than 20 percent after it warned of weak third-quarter results and cuts in enterprise and public sector spending in the near term. [ID:nN1E76P240]   Juniper quickly downplayed the departures, saying its client relationships remained intact.   “Cisco’s actions reflect that Juniper continues to take share from the company,” spokesman David Shane said in an emailed statement. “We have a deep bench of sales talent and our customer relationships are not affected by the departure of a few employees.   Neal Oristano, who had headed Juniper’s Americas service-provider sales for the past 7 years, becomes Cisco’s global service-provider sales chief. Jim Labovites, who worked under Oristano, also joins the U.S. arm of that organization.   Four other Juniper executives — James Godson, Ray Testa, Tom Roberts and Dan Darrow — will also take up various positions within the same group, Cisco said in a statement.   “While we have fought hard against that team to earn our customers’ business, I have a very healthy respect for the type of growth they’ve delivered to Juniper’s service provider business,” Nick Adamo, Cisco’s global service-provider markets chief, to whom all six will report, said in a blogpost.

38,CSCO,"Cisco, networking companies deal with more bad news","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Wall Street underestimated the effect of cuts in government spending on the networking industry and may have to curtail its expectations again with growing fears of a global economic slowdown.  Cisco Systems, which since last year has warned that government spending cuts will include network equipment, reports its quarterly results on Wednesday. Investors expect a weak outlook after Juniper Networks and Brocade Communications Systems slashed their forecasts.  The companies’ shares have been punished in a big selloff for an industry touted as high-growth because of the advent of multimedia streaming, smartphones and demand from China.  Adding to concerns about the economy and government spending, debt ratings agency Standard & Poor’s downgraded the United States’ long-term credit rating on Friday, citing concerns about the nation’s budget deficits and climbing debt.  “If you’re an IT manager and you’re looking at your capital budget and you see all this craziness going on in the world right now, are you inclined to be little bit more conservative? I think the answer has to be yes,” said Jefferies analyst George Notter.  Cisco’s John Chambers, one of the most influential chief executives in Silicon Valley, warned investors a year ago of “unusual uncertainty” in the economy and he has continued to be cautious about public-sector spending.  Analysts have also blamed missteps by the world’s top manufacturer of routers and switches for the slowdown in its business, saying it was losing market share to rivals including Juniper and Hewlett-Packard. Cisco is overhauling itself and cutting jobs as it tries to revive growth.  But the warnings by Juniper and Brocade underscore how much broader economic issues plague the business.  “John Chambers has been citing slowdowns that weren’t showing up in other parts of the industry. So the issue of how much was Cisco-specific and how much was (sector) specific has been a raging debate. Now we’ve found out Cisco has some company in the slowdown,” said BGC analyst Colin Gillis.  Investors vaporized almost a third of Brocade’s stock value on Friday after the company cut its quarterly forecast because of cutbacks at federal agencies and softer-than-expected corporate IT spending. And late in July, Juniper saw $3 billion of its market capitalization vanish in a single session after it issued a bleak profit forecast.  High U.S. unemployment and the threat of financial crises in Europe have spurred caution among telecom carriers that once rushed to build out infrastructure in anticipation of a boom in bandwidth-gobbling Internet, smartphone and tablet use.  “The market is weakening,” said Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu. “Because of this environment, the service providers and corporations want to keep spending on a leash. The lead times are very short.”  A recent deal by U.S. legislators to reduce the federal budget means the U.S. government is also likely to buy less networking equipment. Cisco depends on government spending for about a fifth of its sales.  Wu said he was optimistic about the business’s long-term prospects as fast-growing adoption of smartphones and other mobile gadgets spurs demand for bigger and better networks and data centers.  Investors sitting on the fence will want to hear Chambers out on Wednesday. Cisco’s fiscal fourth quarter runs through July, later than many of its peers, offering investors a more updated look at the industry.  Its global scale and a clientele spanning businesses and government agencies had made it one of the technology sector’s bellwethers.  But it has its own issues, or in Chambers words, “lost its way” after spending too freely on consumer initiatives. In July, Cisco said it planned to cut 15 percent of its workforce and sell a set-top box factory in Mexico as part of an effort to slash annual expenses by $1 billion.  Its shares have slid 30 percent so far this year.  Cisco’s revenue is expected to be $10.976 billion for the July quarter and $10.994 billion for the current quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Investors vaporized almost a third of Brocade’s stock value on Friday after the company cut its quarterly forecast because of cutbacks at federal agencies and softer-than-expected corporate IT spending. And late in July, Juniper saw $3 billion of its market capitalization vanish in a single session after it issued a bleak profit forecast.   High U.S. unemployment and the threat of financial crises in Europe have spurred caution among telecom carriers that once rushed to build out infrastructure in anticipation of a boom in bandwidth-gobbling Internet, smartphone and tablet use.   “The market is weakening,” said Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu. “Because of this environment, the service providers and corporations want to keep spending on a leash. The lead times are very short.”   A recent deal by U.S. legislators to reduce the federal budget means the U.S. government is also likely to buy less networking equipment. Cisco depends on government spending for about a fifth of its sales.   Wu said he was optimistic about the business’s long-term prospects as fast-growing adoption of smartphones and other mobile gadgets spurs demand for bigger and better networks and data centers.   Investors sitting on the fence will want to hear Chambers out on Wednesday. Cisco’s fiscal fourth quarter runs through July, later than many of its peers, offering investors a more updated look at the industry.   Its global scale and a clientele spanning businesses and government agencies had made it one of the technology sector’s bellwethers.   But it has its own issues, or in Chambers words, “lost its way” after spending too freely on consumer initiatives. In July, Cisco said it planned to cut 15 percent of its workforce and sell a set-top box factory in Mexico as part of an effort to slash annual expenses by $1 billion. [ID:nL3E7IJ0JG]   Its shares have slid 30 percent so far this year.   Cisco’s revenue is expected to be $10.976 billion for the July quarter and $10.994 billion for the current quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  (Additional reporting by Sinead Carew.

41,CSCO,"UPDATE 5-Cisco surpasses low expectations, shares pop"," * Quarterly rev forecast in line, drives relief rally   * Chambers early comments mixed   * Shares swing north after hours  (Adds Q1 forecast and industry outlook, analyst’s comment)   By Noel Randewich   SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) forecast slim revenue growth this quarter, a pleasant surprise to investors bracing for a sharp pullback in global technology spending that sent its shares soaring 10 percent.   The world’s leader in Internet networking equipment predicted in-line sales growth of 1 to 4 percent this quarter after posting quarterly results on Wedensday that edged past Wall Street’s scaled-back expectations.   Analysts took that as an early sign that tough measures to return the Silicon Valley giant to growth — including layoffs and asset sales — were taking hold. Some feared Cisco would follow rivals Juniper Networks (JNPR.N) and Brocade BRCD.O in slashing results forecasts.   “The guidance was in-line — which was much better than feared,” said Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu.   “There were expectations that they would guide down like most of their smaller peers.”   Cisco shed about a third of its value in 2011, punished by flagging growth and the loss of market share to aggressive rivals like Juniper.   The erstwhile stock market darling, which depends on government spending for about a fifth of its revenue, said in July it would cut 15 percent of its workforce and sell a set-top box factory in Mexico as part of an effort to slash annual expenses by $1 billion. [ID:nL3E7IJ0JG]   CEO John Chambers, who in April famously said Cisco had lost its way, told analysts he foresaw “gradual improvement” in the business, while warning again of a challenges for global public sector spending in coming quarters.   That came after the company racked up better-than-expected sales, profit and margins in the fiscal fourth quarter.   Shares of Cisco rose as much as 10 percent in extended trade after closing down 2.3 percent on Nasdaq. They later backtracked and were up 8 percent at $14.81.   “They beat a low bar. A lot of it is coming from cost cutting, which we anticipated. In that sense it’s a relief,” said Joanna Makris of Mizuho Securities USA.    A look at how other technology and telecoms bellwethers have fared this earnings season: r.reuters.com/nuw62s  Cisco has warned since last year that government spending cuts would include network equipment, and that a deal last week to reduce the U.S. federal budget deficit could hurt the San Jose, California company’s business more. [ID:nN1E777190]   Investor sentiment also worsened after rivals Juniper Networks Inc and Brocade Communications Systems Inc slashed outlooks in recent weeks as the economic picture darkened, slamming their shares.   Its first-quarter projection translated to revenue of about $10.86 billion to more than $11 billion. Analysts on average had expected revenue of about $10.95 billion in the fiscal first quarter ending October.   They had expected fourth-quarter revenue of $10.97 billion from Cisco, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Gross margins came in at 62.7 percent, dipping from 63.9 percent in the fiscal third quarter but ahead of analysts’ projections for under 62 percent.   And net income slid 36.3 percent to $1.2 billion or 22 cents a share, from $1.9 billion or 33 cents a share a year earlier. Excluding certain items, it earned 40 cents share, just above the 38 cents expected on average.   “The real issue is, does he (Chambers) give a chilling outlook or is it just a conservative outlook? Have things grinded to a halt, or is the enterprise still spending?” asked Colin Gillis, BGC Partners analyst.

42,CSCO,Banks drag Wall Street lower as fear returns,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fear returned to Wall Street on Wednesday, sending the S&P 500 to another 4 percent decline, triggered by worries that Europe’s debt crisis could engulf French banks and spill onto the U.S. financial sector.  Trading was once again marked by sharp moves on heavy volume. For a fifth straight day, the Dow industrials fluctuated in a range of more than 400 points.  “What you’re seeing is a very short-term, direction-oriented market,” said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer of North Star Investment Management Corp in Chicago.  Worries about the strength of French lenders, including Societe Generale, triggered a selloff in European and U.S. banks. Rumors about SocGen’s financial health, which the bank denied, sent its shares tumbling 14.7 percent.  An index of European banks dropped 6.7 percent and the KBW index of U.S. bank stocks slid 4.9 percent as fear grew of a possible contagion of any French crisis. Bank of America Corp lost 10.9 percent to $6.77 and Goldman Sachs slid more than 10 percent to $110.34.  The Dow Jones industrial average lost 519.83 points, or 4.62 percent, to 10,719.94. The S&P 500 fell 51.77 points, or 4.42 percent, to 1,120.76. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 101.47 points, or 4.09 percent, to 2,381.05.  Wednesday’s drop came a day after stocks rallied on the Federal Reserve’s pledge to keep interest rates near zero for at least two more years.  Even after Tuesday’s snap-back rally, the S&P 500 is down almost 18 percent from its 2011 closing high set April 29.  The losses came against the backdrop of recent weak U.S. economic data, the United States losing its triple-A credit rating from Standard & Poor’s and the inability of lawmakers to address worries that another recession may be on the way.  About 15.1 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, almost double the year’s estimated daily average of 7.8 billion.  Volume once again spiked in the last hour of trading, and the market closed near its session lows. Of late, overleveraged investors with losses on their books have been forced to sell shares near the end of the day.  “Between 3 and 3:20 (p.m.) you have people getting margin calls, and on days like today there’s some nervousness about what those calls will look like,” said Andrew Frankel, co-president of Stuart Frankel & Co in New York, referring to the volatility of the final hour of trading.  Slides in the value of stocks may increase the cash needed in margin accounts, which can spark further selling.  Dow component Walt Disney Co dropped 9.1 percent to $31.54 a day after the entertainment company’s quarterly results failed to reassure investors that it could do well in a weak U.S. economy.

46,CSCO,"Cisco's Q4 beats Street view, focus on outlook","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc’s quarterly results edged past Wall Street’s scaled-back expectations as IT spending held up despite fears of a severe pullback, buoying its shares in extended trading.  The world’s largest networking equipment maker reported sales of $11.2 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, surpassing expectations for under $11 billion. Net income beat estimates as the industry bellwether — which is trying to rekindle growth after overspending on a spate of non-core businesses — cut costs.  Investors will now want to hear Chief Executive John Chambers’ outlook for the current quarter and his views on how an increasingly gloomy economic picture will impact the networking industry.  “They beat a low bar. A lot of it is coming from cost cutting, which we anticipated. In that sense it’s a relief,” said Joanna Makris of Mizuho Securities USA.

Stocks zigzagged on Tuesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve promised to hold interest rates low for at least two years, before the S&P 500 index rallied 5 percent into the close. But the Fed’s statement also underlined the struggling economy and was a reminder that markets would likely remain choppy in the near term. For details, see [ID:nN1E7780FW]   “At this point of time, investors’ heads are spinning,” said Oliver Pursche, president at Gary Goldberg Financial Services in Suffern, New York.   “We anticipate further volatility,” he said. “I even think we are going to retest the lows that were set on Monday.”   Even with Tuesday’s rally, the broad S&P 500 is down 14 percent from a peak at the end of April after falling precipitously over the last two weeks — a period that saw an escalating financial crisis in Europe, political gridlock in Washington, and a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating.   S&P 500 futures SPc1 lost 8.2 points and were below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 fell 103 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures NDc1 dropped 18 points.   An increase in bullish sentiment last week, a contrarian indicator, suggests stocks may have further to fall, according to a weekly survey by research group Investors Intelligence.

49,CSCO,Wall Street roars back but selling may return,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks shot up 4 percent on Thursday as bargain-hungry investors overcame the recent wave of fear that drove selling over the last two weeks.  Thursday’s rally marked the second bounce in a yo-yo week. After a sell-off that pushed the S&P 500 down as much as 17 percent since July 22, the market is showing some signs of regaining its footing.  “It’s a bungee cord market. We’ve fallen off of a small bridge, the bungee cord bounced us up, and oscillations will diminish, but we’re still bouncing around,” said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist at D.A. Davidson & Co., in Lake Oswego, Oregon.  Investors used results from Cisco and a slight dip in weekly U.S. jobless claims as the catalyst to snap up beaten-down stocks. Worries about the spread of the European debt crisis were also somewhat alleviated after news of a meeting between France’s Nicolas Sarkozy and Germany’s Angela Merkel set for Tuesday.  Financials outpaced other S&P 500 sectors after leading losses in the previous session. But bank borrowing costs were under some pressure overseas.  The CBOE Volatility Index, known as the VIX, shed 9.3 percent, though it remained near levels not seen in over a year. The day’s trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, was 12.99 billion — well above the year’s estimated daily average of 7.8 billion.  The Dow Jones industrial average surged 423.37 points, or 3.95 percent, to 11,143.31. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index shot up 51.88 points, or 4.63 percent, to 1,172.64. The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 111.63 points, or 4.69 percent, at 2,492.68.  “We’re seeing a net flow of buy orders from retail investors here, so they’re looking for bargains. I have not had anybody call me and say, ‘Here’s what I own. Tell me what I ought to sell,’ and I’ve seen that in other high-volatility periods,” Dickson said.  After the close, Nvidia Corp shares jumped 15.6 percent to $15.50 after the graphics chipmaker gave a quarterly revenue forecast that exceeded analysts’ average forecast.  While the major indexes showed strong gains on Thursday, the S&P 500 has fallen for 11 of the past 14 sessions.  Analysts said they still awaited a bottom in the correction that has taken the S&P 500 down 14 percent from its April 29 closing high.  “The trend is downward now. We’re having a big up day, but it’s been very volatile. We’ve been up against resistance for a little while in the 1,170 level in the S&P 500 ... our next level I believe is 1,188,” said Stephen J Guilfoyle, U.S. economist for Meridian Equity Partners and institutional sales trader on the NYSE floor.  One sign the market’s downturn may not be over is a measure of stocks with 52-week highs versus 52-week lows, according to Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist at Delta Global Asset Management in Boston.  “Some days need to pass before that indicator reverses,” which would then suggest a bottom, he said.  Among the day’s best sectors, the S&P financial index jumped 6.3 percent, while the semiconductor index gained 5.2 percent. Another top advancer was the Dow Jones Transportation Average, up 4.3 percent.  Retailers also provided support after Kohl’s Corp advanced 7.3 percent to $47.50 after the moderate-priced department store chain’s quarterly earnings beat estimates and it raised its full-year profit view. The S&P consumer discretionary index rose 4.5 percent.  Labor Department data showed new U.S. claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a four-month low last week, a dose of better news after a spate of soft economic data.  Cisco Systems Inc jumped 16 percent to $15.92 a day after it reported quarterly revenue and profits that topped scaled-back expectations.

Thursday’s rally marked the second bounce in a yo-yo week. After a sell-off that has pushed the S&P 500 down as much as 17 percent since July 22, the market is showing some signs of regaining its footing.   “It’s a bungee cord market. We’ve fallen off of a small bridge, the bungee cord bounced us up, and oscillations will diminish, but we’re stil bouncing around,” said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist, D.A. Davidson & Co. Lake Oswego, Oregon.   Investors used results from Cisco (CSCO.O) and a slight dip in weekly U.S. jobless claims as the catalyst to snap up beaten-down stocks. Worries about the spread of the European debt crisis were also somewhat alleviated after news of a meeting between France’s Nicolas Sarkozy and Germany’s Angela Merkel set for Tuesday.   Financials outpaced other S&P sectors after leading losses in the previous session, but analysts said they still awaited a bottom for the recent correction that has taken the S&P 500 down more than 14 percent from its April 29 highs.   However, bank borrowing costs were under some pressure overseas.

55,CSCO,Cisco bulls may underestimate tough road ahead,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc still faces tough challenges with tight public spending and fears of a new economic downturn, analysts warned, after the giant Silicon Valley company ended a year’s worth of disappointing sales forecasts.  Shares of Cisco surged over 16 percent on Thursday, a day after Chief Executive John Chambers delivered quarterly results suggesting that tough measures to return the company to health were paying off, impressing investors who had braced themselves for the worst.  “Cisco was left for dead,” said Gleacher & Co analyst Brian Marshall.  “Investors felt like the earth was salted for Cisco’s opportunity, that their core markets are mid-single digits businesses and ... that Cisco would forever be a one- to two-times GDP grower relegated to the status of an IBM (International Business Machines Corp or an HP (a Hewlett-Packard Co),” Marshall said. “That remains to be seen.”  Chambers, who in April famously warned that the world’s leader in Internet networking equipment had lost its way and a year ago spoke of “unusual uncertainty” in the economy, on Wednesday said he expects gradual improvement in the business.  He signaled that demand from governments and corporations for networking might not be as bad as had been feared.  The Street applauded the upbeat results and outlook, but some analysts questioned whether it was enough to justify such a large stock surge and said much of the jump was probably a reflection of recent broad market volatility.  Cisco’s shares, which had lost a third of their value since the beginning of 2011, were trading at $15.99.  Those analysts warned investors not to underestimate how much public spending budgets could be cut next year and said Cisco might need to prune more product lines and perhaps exit some more unprofitable businesses.  The one-time Wall Street darling, which depends on government spending for about a fifth of its revenue, said in July it would cut 15 percent of its workforce and sell a set-top box factory in Mexico as part of an effort to slash annual expenses by $1 billion.  “Its great that they’re tightening their belts and kind of taming the beast a bit, but there are some fundamental misalignments they still need to address.” Mizuho Securities analyst Joanna Makris said.  She said a budget flush as the U.S. federal government wraps up its fiscal year in September would help Cisco in the current quarter, but government spending next year is less clear.  Brokerage Stifel Nicolaus raised its rating on the stock to “buy” from “hold,” and said Cisco seemed to have left the worst behind, echoing many analysts’ opinions.  “Although the macro environment and public sector spending could continue to put pressure on switching and overall sales, the company is starting to see some stability in orders,” the brokerage said in a research note.  Cisco forecast current-quarter revenue up 1 to 4 percent, in line with expectations. Its fiscal fourth-quarter results were a bit above forecasts. Gross margins, though, came in at 62.7 percent, dipping from 63.9 percent in the fiscal third quarter.  “Gross margin is always a very important issue for a tech company and their gross margins continued to slide. Their topline growth is pretty anemic. And they just made major cost cuts, so we still don’t know their full impact on the total business,” said William Blair analyst Jason Ader.

61,CSCO,Berkowitz's Fairholme slashes U.S. stock holdings," NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Bruce Berkowitz’s Fairholme Capital Group roughly halved its U.S. stock holdings in the second quarter by moving some of its money into more concentrated bets like insurer American International Group (AIG.N), according to a regulatory filing.   The Miami-based money-management firm’s equity stake in AIG nearly doubled to about 103 million shares in the quarter ended June 30, Fairholme’s most recent 13-F filing shows.   However, Fairholme no longer held about 23 million in warrants in AIG, at the end of the second quarter. It is possible some of those warrants were converted into common stock in the period.   Berkowitz’s firm also added shares of Assured Guaranty (AGO.N), a new position in the second quarter.   Overall, Fairholme now has stakes in 20 U.S. listed companies, down from 28 companies at the end of the first quarter.   Some of the stocks Berkowitz’s firm eliminated from its portfolio include Cisco Systems (CSCO.O), Astrazeneca (ASTR.NS) and Bristol-Meyers Squibb, according to the filing.   The filing shows that Berkowitz, in the second quarter, had remained as bullish as ever on troubled lender Bank of America (BAC.N). As of June 30, the number of Bank of America shares owned by Fairholme stood at 99 million, up slightly from the end of the first quarter.   His position in Florida real estate concern St. Joe Co also was largely unchanged at 26.6 million.

Representative Kevin Brady said multinational corporations should be allowed to bring back into the country much of an estimated $1.5 trillion in overseas profits at a tax rate of 5.25 percent, rather than the 35 percent statutory rate.   Brady is sponsoring legislation that would allow such a repatriation holiday for one year, a step he said would pump money into the struggling economy.   “The top goal should be to reform this tax code, but that looks increasingly less likely this year. So we want to pull the trigger on repatriation this year in this economy when it will do the most good,” he said in an interview.   A number of large U.S. technology and pharmaceutical companies — from Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) to Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) — are engaged in a lobbying campaign for a repatriation holiday.   Brady is the fourth-ranking Republican on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. His bill so far is the main vehicle for the pro-repatriation holiday effort, though aides and lobbyists said other legislation may yet emerge.   The Obama administration has firmly opposed allowing a repatriation tax break independent of a broad-ranging corporate tax code reform package. Many Democrats in Congress are similarly opposed to legislation like Brady’s, which they see as a give-away to large businesses.   “Everyone knows comprehensive reform is the solution,” Brady said. “But finding partners in the White House and the Senate who will make the very difficult decisions it takes to both simplify and lower those tax rates, on both the business and the individual sides, that will be very difficult given the political environment.   “We hold out hope. We also know the clock is ticking.”   The U.S. tax code has not been reformed in 25 years. Since President Ronald Reagan closed many of its loopholes and raised corporate taxes, the code has become riddled with exemptions, deductions and exclusions for businesses and individuals.   Thanks to one of those loopholes, known as overseas income deferral, large corporations have accumulated hundreds of billions of dollars in profits overseas through various means. By not bringing them back into the country, the companies avoid paying the full U.S. corporate income tax on the funds.   With the economy in distress, these corporations are portraying a repatriation holiday as a form of economic stimulus and promising that it would create jobs.   Studies have shown that a similar tax holiday approved in 2004 with the backing of former President George W. Bush resulted in little job creation. Brady and others dispute those studies.   “The story from the earlier repatriation is very solid,” he said, adding that he was uncertain whether a new congressional “super committee” being formed to tackle spending and tax issues would deal with the repatriation holiday issue.   “I know everyone’s going to continue to push for full, comprehensive reform. At some point, leaders will have to make a call on whether to go forward with repatriation or not. My guess is it will be before the end of the year,” he said.

63,CSCO,Analysis: Company report pace frustrates accounting experts,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Author and lawyer Michael Young jokes about the days when it took more time to get some companies’ financial statements than it did for Columbus to discover America.  Alas, those days are still here.  In an age of lightning-fast stock trades and instant communications, yearly and quarterly financial reports seem stuck on an industrial-era pace that some say was obsolete decades ago.  “Financial reporting technology allows all sorts of possibilities about which we could not even fantasize back in the Great Depression when our periodic system was put in place,” said Young, a partner at law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher.  Young and other accounting experts have long called for a move to real-time, online reports in lieu of quarterly earnings statements that investors now use to decide whether to buy stocks.  Cheap computing power has made real-time reports more technically feasible, but advocates still struggle to draw wide support for the idea.  The world’s six biggest audit firms — Deloitte, Ernst & Young, PwC, KPMG, BDO and Grant Thornton — advocated speedier reporting in a November 2006 report, but acknowledge there are hurdles.  “There isn’t anything imminent out there that would change the financial reporting model that we have today to make it more of a real-time model,” said Tom Omberg, head of Deloitte & Touche’s financial accounting and reporting services. “A lot of issues would have to get worked out before that could become a reality.”  Yet others say real-time reporting is worth revisiting.  “Almost any company with rational management tracks its performance daily and makes critical business decisions on the basis of data and trends that should be distilled and published for public consumption,” said Harvey Pitt, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), for example, has perfected a “virtual close,” the ability to put together a complete set of financial statements in just a few hours. Free, open-source software has allowed even much smaller companies to construct dashboard-like digital displays that continuously track sales, orders and other key figures.  That kind of data could help make the stock market much more transparent, said Paul Miller, a University of Colorado accounting professor.  “If I’m an investor, why can’t I go on the Web and see what the Wal-Mart sales are today?” Miller asked.  Instead, investors have to wait to find out what happened months ago.  “It’s a constant state of incomplete information and the consequence of that incompleteness is discounted stock prices, which means a higher cost of capital,” he added.  The SEC has been shrinking the time between financial reports since 2002. The largest companies, which once had 45 days to file quarterly reports, now have just 40 days, while their deadline for annual reports has been trimmed to 60 from 90 days. Small companies can still take 90 days to file annual reports — still longer than Columbus’s 70-day voyage.  A big hurdle in speeding things up more is figuring out how to audit real-time figures or the systems that produce them.  “If you wanted to go to a more real-time report, for example, a voluntary disclosure that companies could make to their shareholders, I don’t see how it could feasibly be done with an auditor’s report,” said Scott Whisenant, an accounting professor at the Bauer College of Business in Houston.  Some companies fear that more frequent reports would keep investors too focused on short-term performance. Retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and Dollar General Corp (DG.N), which once reported monthly sales, have stopped that practice.  Eventually, some companies may embrace real-time disclosures to build more trust in the capital markets, said W. David Stephenson, a homeland security expert and author of Data Dynamite, a book about data sharing.  “I do think that quarterly reporting is going to become an artifact at some point and that it’s going to start with some companies — maybe banks — that have a particular credibility problem,” he said.  One change that may pave the way to more real-time reporting is an SEC requirement that companies tag their financial data with computer codes called XBRL, or extensible business reporting language, he said.  Those tags will help streamline financial reporting and allow auditors and regulators to check it more quickly.  “It would obviously be a headache for investors to try to process financial information on a daily basis, but what a real-time system would allow investors to do is step back and say to themselves: ‘What period of analysis for this particular company makes sense?’” said Young, the lawyer at Willkie Farr.  More real-time reporting might also result in smaller gyrations in a company’s share price because investors could adjust their expectations each day, he said.  “What we could do is get beyond the one-size-fits-all torture of having everything reported during earnings season,” he added.

64,CSCO,"HP, Dell hammered as tech-spending outlook darkens","BANGALORE/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell Inc fell on Wednesday as the outlook for U.S. and European corporate government technology spending dimmed.  Investors had hoped for a rebound in public and enterprise spending on hardware upgrades this year to offset stubborn consumer weakness, but it has yet to fully materialize.  Dell’s shares fell 10.6 percent a day after the world’s No. 2 PC maker slashed its full-year revenue forecast. Bigger rival HP, due to report results after Thursday’s close, slid more than 4 percent to $31.25.  Cisco Systems Inc, which relies heavily on government clients, slid 1.8 percent to $15.71.  “Investors are understandably cautious about whether the environment could now get worse,” RBC analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a client note.  “Like Cisco and other peers, Dell is seeing demand here pressured due to public expenditure reductions which are not expected to abate anytime soon.”  On Tuesday, Dell forecast fiscal 2012 revenue growth at 1-5 percent, down from 5-9 percent, and said weak government and corporate spending may not hold up in the face of flagging economic growth.  Wednesday’s sell-off came despite Dell reporting better-than-expected margins in the second quarter, as investors focused on the lowered outlook.  RBC lowered its price target to $17 from $20, but maintained its “sector perform” rating on the company’s stock.  HP and Dell, mindful of the low-margin business of cranking out personal computers and hardware, are venturing out of traditional comfort zones into enterprise solutions and services. They are also developing mobile devices like tablets to try and take on the likes of Apple Inc.  But major clients remain key: Dell gets three-fourths of its revenue from sales to large enterprises, while HP gets a little more than half from the same.  Continuing soft sales to consumers have troubled HP, which has a more diversified hardware and services portfolio, over the last several quarters.  In the second quarter, HP cut its profit forecast for the year, saying it needs to invest heavily on hiring and expanding its services division to recover from “missed opportunities” under previous Chief Executive Mark Hurd.  Still, Bank of America Merrill Lynch expects the low investor sentiment on Dell, its cheap valuation and possible gains from an enterprise refresh, will position the shares to outperform in 2011.

71,CSCO,Analysis: Outlook for tech spending getting darker,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Hopes are rapidly dwindling that there will be even modest growth in technology spending during the second half of 2011. And 2012 may be no better.  Underscoring how governments around the world are rapidly scaling back purchases to try and reduce swelling deficits, the Navy shocked technology executives last month by quietly announcing it planned to cut its IT budget by a whopping 25 percent over five years.  While most analysts do not expect other agencies to attempt such dramatic cuts, they say that the Navy’s plan is a clear indicator that governments have joined businesses in taking a more critical look at technology spending.  That latest bombshell, coupled with warnings from bellwether technology vendors from Dell Inc to Cisco Systems Inc, are prompting analysts to trim their forecasts and warn of threats to the bottom lines of major suppliers from IBM to Hewlett-Packard Co.  “They are putting more scrutiny on spending. They are looking at cutting back,” said Rebecca Wettemann, an analyst with technology research firm Nucleus Research.  It is unclear what might happen to budgets at other U.S. agencies as they wait for a congressional deficit super-committee to identify new spending cuts. The group is charged with finding at least $1.2 trillion in budget savings by November 23.  Meanwhile, European technology budgets are likely to contract as the region’s economy worsens.  “We could go into an economic recession and see tech spending decline,” said Forrester Research analyst Andrew Bartels.  While Bartels remains hopeful that global IT spending will grow in the second half, he warns of a “high probability” Europe will slip into a recession in the third or fourth quarter, causing tech spending there to drop from last year.  Gartner, the world’s biggest technology research firm, is planning to cut its forecasts for IT spending when it updates those numbers next month.  It now expects spending to rise about 3 percent at constant currency in the second half of this year, below its current forecast for 3.6 percent growth.  Gartner also projects that IT spending will grow about 3 percent next year, below the current forecast for 5 percent growth, said Gartner analyst Richard Gordon.  “We are still in the hangover of the global financial crisis and the subsequent recession,” he said.  Other experts on technology spending are even more pessimistic.  Two academics who advise big corporations on technology strategies said that some of the world’s biggest corporations could cut IT budgets before the end of the year. That could cause total technology spending to drop in both the fourth quarter and all of 2012.  Eric Johnson, director of the Center for Digital Strategies at the Tuck School of Business, said hardware makers in particular will be under pressure because companies are delaying upgrades of PCs and servers. Instead they are spending money on smaller, portable devices like Apple Inc’s iPad, which has a lower unit cost.  “There is a huge movement going on to less-expensive devices. It’s a tidal wave,” he said. “I call it the deflation of technology.”  One of the main victims of that trend is HP, which just killed the TouchPad tablet it created to challenge the iPad, cut earnings projections, and announced it is considering pulling out of the PC business, where it is the largest player.  “HP waited too long to get out of the PC business,” Johnson said.  Howard Anderson, a lecturer at MIT’s Sloan School of Business, said his contacts in the corporate world are cutting back on hardware purchases. But he expects Apple and makers of other hot mobile devices to fare better in coming months than most technology companies because consumers are so far willing to spend on the latest gadgets.  “If I work for a corporation, it’s ‘Guess what? Your laptop is going to last another year. Suck it up,’” he said. “But if I absolutely have to have the next iPad or iPhone, I’ll find a way to buy it.”  ",8242011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-technology-slowdown/analysis-outlook-for-tech-spending-getting-darker-idUSTRE77N7TY20110824

73,CSCO,Insight: Showdown looms on U.S. overseas profit tax break,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Backed by powerful companies spending millions of dollars, Washington lobbyists are fighting in the marble corridors of Congress for a tax break on $1.5 trillion in profits held overseas to escape the U.S. tax man.  When lawmakers return next month from summer break, powerful high-tech and pharmaceutical companies will step up their push for an overseas profit tax repatriation holiday and pose a test for President Barack Obama. (For a graphic please click on r.reuters.com/fuj43s)  The idea has been kicking around for months, gaining only limited traction, but supporters sense their moment may be near, with the economy sluggish and Obama searching for new ways to ignite business investment and create jobs.  A repatriation tax holiday offers just that, advocates say, although critics contend the proposal’s promises of economic stimulus are illusory and serve only to mask a tax break costing the United States $80 billion over 10 years.  The White House, so far, has stood firm against a holiday, refusing to consider it outside the context of making broad changes in the convoluted tax code.  That stance could be strained as the November 2012 elections near with 9.1 percent of Americans unemployed and Obama courting corporate support for his reelection campaign.  “As this economy continues to struggle, I think our case gets stronger every day,” said Republican Representative Kevin Brady, author of a repatriation tax holiday bill backed by 15 Republicans and eight Democrats in the House of Representatives.  “Lowering that tax rate for a year to bring those dollars home, people don’t understand why we’re not doing that. Some may view it as a tax break, but others just see these stranded profits that could do a lot of good things,” Brady said.  No Senate bill has emerged, but Democratic Senator Kay Hagan is considering one, her spokeswoman said.  “Repatriation is on the table,” said Chris Krueger, policy analyst at investment firm MF Global.  Like most analysts, however, he said a new 12-member “super committee” being formed to tackle the federal deficit likely will not embrace a tax holiday, as promoted by a corporate lobbying group called the WIN America campaign.  The main reason? The White House and other Democratic opponents want to use it as leverage as long as they can to gain concessions from corporations on other tax reform issues.  “Repatriation ... is an important bargaining lever - not one to be given away easily by lawmakers,” he said.  Congress still feels burned by the last repatriation tax holiday. Approved in 2004 with the backing of President George W. Bush, that tax break did little to boost the economy, despite promises of job-creating investment.  Democratic Representative Lloyd Doggett said another such corporate give-away would simply be a mistake.  “The tax holiday promoted by the WIN America coalition is a real loser for hardworking Americans,” Doggett told Reuters.  “It didn’t create jobs last time and ... multinational corporations have no intention of using this repatriation tax windfall to create jobs. A bargain tax rate on foreign profits, many hidden in tax havens, would be an incentive for job creation abroad and even more layoffs at home.”  The repatriation tax holiday fight opens a window into the game of writing tax law in Washington and the tightly knit group of politicians and lobbyists who play it.  * Duke Energy Corp CEO Jim Rogers, a Southerner with ties to Democrats, is a frequent public speaker for WIN America, advocating for the tax holiday. Rogers led a fund-raising committee to bring the 2012 Democratic National Convention to Charlotte, North Carolina, where Duke is based. The company guaranteed a $10 million line of credit for the event.  * On a more private level, lobbyists and aides said, Oracle President Safra Catz and Cisco Systems Inc CEO John Chambers — both leaders of California high-tech giants — have met lawmakers to talk up the WIN America cause. Besides Oracle and Cisco, two other WIN America supporters are Apple Inc and Google Inc. Employees of all four of these firms have been generous Obama supporters, altogether donating $1.3 million to his 2008 campaign, according to Sunlight, according to the Sunlight Foundation, a good government watchdog group.  * WIN America has hired dozens of former staffers of congressional tax writing panels, according to Sunlight.  Ex-Congressman Jim McCrery, once the top Republican on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, is lobbying for the group. So is Jeff Forbes, former chief of staff to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, a key player. Baucus played a central role in killing the last attempt to get a repatriation tax holiday approved. He stood firmly against an amendment offered in 2009 by fellow Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer. It failed in a 55-42 vote.  The stance taken by Baucus — a member of the new deficit “super committee” — will be crucial this time around for WIN America and its allies, said aides and lobbyists. A Senate Finance Committee aide said only that Baucus “is examining proposals in the context of comprehensive tax reform and the forthcoming deficit reduction efforts.”  Nearly everyone on both sides of the repatriation debate agrees that the tax code, especially the part of it dealing with overseas corporate profits, needs an overhaul.  “The way we tax our multinationals is broken,” said Duke Senior Vice President for Tax Keith Butler in an interview, adding that Duke’s corporate tax return is 10,000 pages long.  But like other executives backing WIN America, Butler said tax reform will take too long and repatriation is needed now.  “Repatriation would really boost and help the United States now ... We can’t wait the two or three years that tax reform might take to get these funds back in the U.S.,” he said.  The tale of the overseas profits at stake reaches around the world, from the Paranapanema River in southern Brazil where Duke has a string of hydroelectric dams to a prim office park in Dublin that is home to the Irish subsidiary of Oracle.  Foreign operations like these have generated, in legal ways, an estimated $1.5 trillion in overseas corporate income for U.S. corporations on which no U.S. corporate income tax is paid as long as the funds stay abroad.  The U.S. corporate income tax rate is 35 percent. Profits earned at home in the United States are taxed right away at that rate, though other corporate tax breaks frequently allow large companies to pay a much lower effective rate.  Income earned abroad is a different story. In most cases, taxes on these profits may be deferred. As a result, some global firms have an incentive to put as much income as they can in foreign subsidiaries located in low-tax countries.  When U.S. companies do repatriate overseas profits, they are taxed at the 35-percent rate, minus credits for taxes already paid to their foreign subsidiaries’ host countries.  On profits that are not repatriated, only the host-country tax must be paid and U.S. corporate income tax is avoided. The trouble is that, over the years, unrepatriated overseas profits pile up. And analysts say that is no accident.  Credit Suisse estimated in April that S&P 500 companies at the end of 2010 had $1.3 trillion overseas.  Perhaps encouraged by Bush’s 2004 repatriation holiday, companies may park profits intentionally abroad “with the hopes of a future tax holiday,” Credit Suisse analysts said.  Congressman Brady’s legislation proposes a tax holiday that would let companies repatriate their overseas profits at the bargain-basement tax rate of 5.25 percent, the same rate adopted under Bush’s 2004 program.  In 2004 and 2005, 843 corporations brought into the United States almost $362 billion from abroad, according to a 2008 Internal Revenue Service analysis.  Those repatriations “did not lead to an increase in domestic investment, employment or R&D — even for firms that lobbied for the tax holiday stating these intentions,” said a 2009 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research.  Most of the money brought back six years ago went to shareholder dividends and stock buybacks, NBER found.  Strictures on the use of the repatriated funds were written into the 2004 measure, but the NBER study showed that companies found ways to get around them.  Brady’s bill would penalize companies that cut their staffs after the repatriation holiday.  The Joint Committee on Taxation, a non-partisan congressional research arm, estimated that a tax holiday similar to Brady’s would initially boost U.S. tax revenues as profits entered the country, but would eventually cost taxpayers about $78.7 billion over the next decade.  Critics said the Brady measure would likely work no better than the 2004 law did at ensuring job-creating investment, and that it would only encourage “accumulate to repatriate” overseas tax strategies by U.S. corporations.

74,CSCO,Wall Street posts first weekly gain in more than a month,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street posted its first weekly gain in more than a month as Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke raised hopes for more stimulus for the economy at the U.S. central bank’s September meeting.  Initially stocks fell after Bernanke stopped short of describing detailed plans to strengthen the ailing economy. But the market turned higher, led by technology shares, as investors concluded the Fed was leaving the door open for action even though many traders believe it has limited power to pull the economy out of a rut.  The CBOE Volatility Index or VIX .VIX, Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” retreated after days of uncertainty on what Bernanke would say. The VIX slid 10.2 percent to 35.69, after earlier falling as much as 14 percent to a session low at 34.33.  “He didn’t give the market the green light for QE3. He also didn’t give the market the red light for QE3,” said Kevin Caron, market strategist at Stifel, Nicolaus in Florham Park, New Jersey, referring to a possible third round of quantitative easing.  “By implying that inflation is viewed as not a concern, it leaves the possibility for something down the road,” he said.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI ended up 134.72 points, or 1.21 percent, at 11,284.54. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 17.53 points, or 1.51 percent, at 1,176.80. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 60.22 points, or 2.49 percent, at 2,479.85.  For the week, the Dow rose 4.3 percent, the S&P gained 4.7 percent and the Nasdaq rose 5.9 percent.  Bernanke, speaking in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, said the central bank’s policy panel would meet for two days in September instead of the scheduled one-day meeting to discuss any more stimulus.  While expressing long-term optimism, Bernanke said the Fed found recent developments troubling and saw a low inflation as staying low.  Shares of property insurers were mixed after falling earlier in the week on worries that severe damage from Hurricane Irene would result in substantial claims.  Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) edged up 0.6 percent to $48.29 after earlier hitting a two-year low. Allstate (ALL.N) was up 0.1 percent at $24.45, having also hit a two-year low. Insurers typically fall before severe weather events and rally later.  Chubb Corp (CB.N) gained 1.2 percent to $59.38.  As Irene bore down on North Carolina, tens of thousands of people evacuated and East Coast cities, including New York, braced for a weekend hit from the powerful storm.  NYSE Euronext NYX.N said the New York Stock Exchange plans to open for trading as usual next week, but because of the possibility of flooding, a decision will not be made until Saturday or Sunday.  Technology stocks led the advance, with Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O) among the Dow’s top gainers.

81,CSCO,Dealtalk: Anti-trust shadow looms over European telco deals,"LONDON (Reuters) - The block on AT&T’s $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA is a grim reminder of the need to do anti-trust homework on deals in mature, slow growth telecoms markets and could put some European players off their takeover plans.  U.S. regulators said the combination of No.2 US wireless provider AT&T with Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile was anti-competitive and could cause wireless prices to rise because it would reduce the number of large players from four to three.  Bankers now fear that European operators may be less inclined to pursue larger consolidation in core markets like Germany and Britain because they may find it harder to convince their own regulators that a similar contraction would not harm consumers.  The problem is surmountable, bankers said, but will require companies and advisers to spend a lot more time on anti-trust angles as they prepare to launch bids and anticipate regulators’ final decisions.  “What’s happening (with AT&T) in the US is only going to make operators more hesitant to embark on consolidation in Europe,” said a banker, who advises European telecom companies, reacting to the setback for AT&T.  “It makes things a bit more difficult... I wanted to use the AT&T deal as a way to convince European operators that they should think bigger on mergers.”  Growth is sluggish in western Europe and large operators including Vodafone and France Telecom are keen to achieve economies of scale by making acquisitions to achieve a top three position in some markets.  At the same time, they are exiting other countries where they are an uncompetitive number four or five.  “We are moving to three-player markets in Europe. It will happen step by step. Mobile broadband is accelerating this trend because capex is increasing,” said Bengt Nordstrom, CEO of Swedish-based telecoms consultancy Northstream.  Vodafone said at the start of the week it was exploring a potential cooperation with Wind Hellas, Greece’s third biggest telecom company, a move that was seen previously as a precursor for in-market consolidation in Europe.  The company has already made $24 billion from a series of exits including China and France.  France Telecom is trying to sell Orange Switzerland after the country’s competition authorities last year blocked a deal that would have merged the unit with Sunrise to create the second largest player behind Swisscom.  “I think there were big questions over (Vodafone and Wind in) Greece before the DOJ ruling. I’m not sure those companies would be setting out to do something today,” a second banker said.  A deal between the companies was considered punchy even before the DOJ ruling because it would reduce the number of mobile player in Greece from three to two, potentially setting a precedent for Europe’s larger markets.  Anti-trust authorities in the US and Europe work together on merger cases when possible but there is no obligation for them to reach a common decision.  The appointment of Joaquin Almunia as European Competition Commissioner early last year has seen both sides seeking better co-ordination, however.  The regulators trumpeted their close cooperation in March last year when they both agreed to Cisco Systems $3.4 billion takeover of Tandberg, a Norwegian video-conferencing company, on the same day.  “When you have a global merger notified to both agencies, there you can have convergence in terms of regulatory stances and you can expect some coordination,” said antitrust lawyer Mario Todino at Gianni Origoni Grippo & Partners.  Cooperation does not automatically mean regulators will ultimately rule as one on the same case.  EU authorities angered their U.S. counterparts when they objected to Oracle’s bid to acquire Sun Microsystems in November 2009 despite U.S. clearance of the deal.  And in 2001, the Commission blocked GE’s takeover of Honeywell despite U.S. approval, resulting in then U.S. President George W. Bush expressing his concerns and Mario Monti, the European Competition Commissioner at the time, deploring political interference.

82,CSCO,How to play it: Potential winners on Obama's Jobs Act plan,"* THE ISSUE: President Barack Obama called on Congress late Thursday to pass a $447 billion package of spending initiatives and tax cuts to boost economic growth and generate jobs. Here are several investment ideas based on his proposals.  By Manuela Badawy  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Obama’s American Jobs Act, which he announced to a rare joint session of Congress late Thursday, includes proposals for a $175 billion one-year extension and expansion of the employee payroll tax holiday that would halve the tax rate to 3.1 percent in 2012 as well as a $65 billion tax break to encourage small businesses to hire more workers. The Act also features $50 billion in spending to upgrade highways, transit, rail and aviation infrastructure.  Wall Street stocks tumbled on Friday as the surprise resignation of a European Central Bank executive board member and skepticism over President Obama’s economic stimulus spending plans weighed on sentiment.  The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 233.93 points, or 2.07 percent, to 11,061.88. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 22.55 points, or 1.90 percent, to 1,163.35, while the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 36.24 points, or 1.43 percent, to 2,492.90.  Consumer discretionary stocks could be helped by the announced moves to help small business. The Obama push is expected to help families with combined incomes of $80,000, said Bernie Williams, vice president of discretionary money management for USAA.  Dollar Tree stores could gain if this stimulates hiring at this income level, added Brian Lazorishak, a portfolio manager at Chase Investment Counsel with $1 billion in assets under management. McDonald’s and Starbucks Corp. and other restaurants could benefit as well, Lazorishak said.  Small business service providers like Intuit, the maker of TurboTax and Quicken accounting software, and those related to staffing that are directly tied to employment are likely to get a boost.  “This financial crisis was a consumer-led recession, so anything that you can do to prop up the consumer and spending is good,” said Williams of USAA. The tax cut is a direct injection to consumers’ pockets.  “That money will get spent. It will get spent more in necessities, like the Targets of the world, staples companies,” said Williams, who has direct management of $4 billion from high net worth individuals. “They will have that stimulus this year and next year if that gets passed.”  Obama’s spending allotment included a healthy dose of funding for public infrastructure, an area of focus in the 2009 ‘stimulus bill,’ and a traditional area of focus for the current administration, J.P. Morgan noted in a report Friday.  The firm said beneficiaries could include aggregate-focused companies Marietta, Vulcan Materials and Eagle Materials and infrastructure-focused firms such as URS Corp., Jacobs Engineer and Fluor Corp.  Keith Wirtz, chief investment officer at Fifth Third Asset Management, with $18 billion in assets, added that capital investment in infrastructure has him bullish on shares of Caterpillar Inc., Fastenal Co. and Cummins Inc..  “Fastenal, for example, is a construction supplies company. It markets globally, experiencing a strong top-line, and is shareholder friendly via dividend growth rate. This fits into the whole infrastructure play,” he said.  Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois, shared Wirtz’s sentiments.  “Caterpillar, Navistar — the big earth-moving equipment and construction vehicles — would benefit on additional spending in construction,” Sampson said.  Government-funded projects including $30 billion to modernize at least 35,000 public schools and $27 billion for investment in the nation’s highway system is “significant” for the construction sector, said Robert Gardiner of Davy Research.  “The act in its current form would be a significant positive for CRH (highways and refurbishment projects) and Wolseley (refurbishment projects),” Gardiner said.  Overall, whatever the federal government does to help states will tend to help cash-stressed local governments, which could consequently help municipal bonds.  Munis should outperform in this environment, Morgan Stanley said in a report. But too much stimulus might boost interest rates. That would not be great news for fixed-income investments like munis, which lose value as rates go up, though the appetite for yield could negate that possibility.  Whether the Obama proposal will actually get passed in a gridlocked Congress remains a major issue. Early results from investors indicate skepticism.  Shares of Dollar Tree were down 1.12 percent while McDonald’s and Starbucks stocks were under more selling pressure in mid-day trading on Friday. McDonald’s fell 4.65 percent and Starbucks dropped 3.37 percent.

84,CSCO,Insight: Cisco suits on China rights abuses to test legal reach,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Two lawsuits by three Chinese dissidents and a human rights group accusing Cisco Systems Inc. of abetting imprisonment and torture could have far-reaching impact on how U.S. technology companies conduct business in authoritarian regimes.  The lawsuits filed in May and June target a second technology company for complicity in human rights abuses in China after Yahoo Inc. in 2007 paid to settle a case in which it was accused of aiding the prosecution of dissidents.  Both cases could provide answers to an evolving legal question: Can U.S. companies be held liable if foreign governments use their products for repression?  The first lawsuit, filed in May by the Human Rights Law Foundation in Washington in the Federal District Court in San Jose, California, accuses Cisco of designing products to help the Chinese government persecute members of China’s banned spiritual group, Falun Gong.  Last Friday, the rights group amended its original complaint, saying it had new evidence that Cisco customized its products specifically to enable the authorities to persecute members of Falun Gong, some of whom were alleged to have been tortured and killed by the Chinese authorities.  The second suit, filed in June in the U.S. District Court in Maryland, says the company was complicit in the arrests and detentions of political writers Du Daobin, Zhou Yuanzhi and Liu Xianbin.  The lawsuits are drawing broad attention from U.S. companies because these are important test cases of the Alien Tort Claims Act, a law dating back to 1789 that accommodates actions in U.S. courts to uphold international law.  “Undoubtedly this is going to be a big case because I think everyone is waiting for the Supreme Court to make a decision,” said Farzana Aslam, a law professor who teaches a course on business and human rights at the University of Hong Kong.  “The reason you’ve got the NGOs engaged is they want to push this issue on a broader platform — the issue of whether corporations should be held accountable for human rights violations.”  Marco Simons, legal director for environmental rights group Earth Rights International who has spent 10 years litigating cases against corporations under the Alien Tort Claims Act, said the lawsuits could test the courts on the standards for liability in aiding and abetting human rights abuses.  “These cases present what will likely be a fairly clear case of Cisco knowing that it is designing systems that would be used to persecute people,” Simons said. “But where the plaintiffs might have a harder time is showing that Cisco really intended to persecute people.  “That wouldn’t really be impossible to show,” he said. “But it’s much easier to show knowledge rather than purpose. These cases could be important for testing that distinction and standard.”  Cisco is the world’s biggest maker of Internet networking equipment. Both lawsuits name several Cisco executives, including Chief Executive John Chambers.  David Cook, Cisco’s communications director for Asia-Pacific, said the company “builds equipment to global standards which facilitate free exchange of information, and we sell the same equipment in China that we sell in other nations worldwide in strict compliance with US government regulations.”  “Cisco does not operate networks in China or elsewhere, nor does Cisco customize our products in any way that would facilitate censorship or repression,” Cook said in emailed comments.  But Daniel Ward, the lawyer representing the three dissidents, said that Cisco “built the entire backbone” of China’s Golden Shield Project, also known as the Great Firewall — the cloak of Internet security authorities use to censor the Internet and track opponents of the Chinese government.  He called the project the 21st-century version of the deadly crackdown on the Tiananmen Square democracy movement in 1989.  “You don’t have to drive tanks to fend away protesters, you just need to pick them off one by one before they have a chance to work on it,” Ward told Reuters. “And they are doing that with technology and software and infrastructure designed and created by Cisco.”  The lawsuit said Cisco “willingly and knowingly provided Chinese officials with technology and training to access private Internet communications, identify anonymous web log authors, prevent the broadcast and dissemination of peaceful speech, and otherwise aid and abet in the violation of...fundamental human rights.”  Both Du and Zhou told Reuters that Chinese security agents had told them during interrogations that they had monitored all their emails.  Du served a three-year prison term starting in June 2004 for “inciting subversion of state power” — a broad charge that China often uses to punish dissidents — while Liu is serving a 10-year sentence on the same charge starting late March. Zhou was detained in 2008 on the pretext of “revealing state secrets.”  Terri Marsh, a lawyer for the Human Rights Law Foundation, told Reuters that its new evidence includes a PowerPoint presentation from Cisco that describes a specific line of products “as the only product on the market capable of recognizing over 90 percent of Falun Gong pictures.”  “This directly implies that Cisco was involved in the final step of the customization — configuring its product to recognize and inspect for Falun Gong information,” Marsh said in emailed comments.  Marsh also said two Cisco employees were quoted as saying in an online Cisco Q&A in 2006 that a person should “use Cisco’s equipment” in response to a question on how a city-wide network can “guard against Falun Gong.”  Cisco’s Cook said that the company was currently reviewing the amended complaint.  “As we said in May when the lawsuit was filed, there is no basis for these allegations against Cisco, and we intend to vigorously defend against them,” he said.  In 2008, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Cisco denied allegations by a human rights activist who said the company had given Chinese authorities technical help in their efforts to censor the Internet.  U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS  While civil litigation cases under the act could take up to an average of 10 years, the suit against Cisco could be a major flashpoint in relations between Washington and Beijing, which have tussled on trade, Internet censorship, human rights and U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.  “It will be interesting to see politically what the U.S. does in relation to these cases,” Simons said. “Issues involving human rights abuses in China are very politically sensitive with the U.S. government.  “In many of the past cases, the U.S. government has intervened to tell the courts to dismiss the case or to express concerns about potential foreign policy problems with China,” he said, adding that most of these were under the Bush administration.  In 2002, the U.S. State Department urged dismissal of a lawsuit against Liu Qi, the Beijing mayor, for human rights abuses committed by Beijing police against Falun Gong practitioners, asking the courts to “be cautious when asked to sit in judgment on the acts of foreign officials taken within their own countries.”  “The Obama administration to my knowledge has not intervened in any Alien Tort cases to suggest that they should be dismissed,” Simons said. “A case like this could test that.”  The suits against Cisco raise a set of tough issues for Western technology companies that want to do business in China, which has the world’s largest number of Internet users.  Ward said his firm was lobbying the U.S. Congress about re-evaluating how American companies conduct their business in China. In February 2006, U.S. lawmakers lashed out at Google Inc., Yahoo Inc., Cisco and Microsoft Corp., because of the companies’ alleged complicity in human rights abuses by the Chinese government.  China treats political dissent as a crime and heavily filters the Internet to suppress it. Since February, it has waged a crackdown on dissent, detaining dozens of dissidents, including famed artist Ai Weiwei, mostly for writing articles critical of the government.  Microsoft’s search engine Bing filters out results in China relating to controversial subjects, such as political dissidents and Taiwan, to be able to operate in the country.  The Alien Tort Claims Act — passed to combat piracy not long after the United States was founded — has been used as the basis of litigation mostly against oil companies and mining firms. Only in recent years has the act been used to target technology firms by human rights groups, who say the companies are complicit in abuses when they help regimes intercept emails and block websites.  In 2009, a U.S. judge ruled that lawsuits seeking monetary damages can continue against five large companies including IBM, which is accused of aiding South Africa’s former apartheid system of racial segregation.  In 2007, Yahoo Inc settled a lawsuit alleging it aided China’s prosecution of several dissidents in a case that prompted criticism of the company for cooperating with an authoritarian government.  Yahoo was criticized by the U.S. Congress when it released to Chinese authorities information relating to the email account of Shi Tao, a Chinese journalist who was arrested in 2004. Shi was sentenced to 10 years in jail for revealing state secrets.  Du, 48, who was jailed for posting articles under a pseudonym on the Internet criticizing the Chinese Communist Party’s rule, said Western technology companies should not cooperate with a government that violates civil rights.  “This kind of cooperation hurts us as well as the companies’ business,” he said. “The publication of our articles are closely monitored and once they’re published, we will end up in jail.”  Du said he was interrogated by police in early August about the lawsuit, but added that the case was “not only for myself, but also for the freedom of every individual in China, to put an end forever to China’s ‘literary jail.’”  ",9092011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-cisco/insight-cisco-suits-on-china-rights-abuses-to-test-legal-reach-idUSTRE78809E20110909

86,CSCO,Chipmaker Broadcom to buy NetLogic for $3.7 billion,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chipmaker Broadcom Corp plans to buy NetLogic Microsystems Inc for about $3.7 billion to expand its lineup of chips used in wireless network equipment to take advantage of growing demand for mobile data services.  The $50-per-share deal, which represents a premium of 57 percent over NetLogic’s Friday close of $31.91 on the Nasdaq, sent NetLogic’s shares soaring 50 percent on Monday. But Broadcom shares were down 2.5 percent at $32.60 as some investors questioned the steep premium.  Broadcom Chief Executive Scott McGregor defended the premium, noting that NetLogic would bring faster profit and revenue growth and that the addition of the products to Broadcom’s lineup would double the size of the network equipment market it can go after to about $12 billion by 2015.  “Premier assets are going to cost more than a fixer-upper,” McGregor told Reuters. “They’re a decent growth company. They accelerate our revenue growth and increase our market opportunity.”  Broadcom already sells different types of chips to the same network equipment makers that use NetLogic products. Broadcom chips help direct traffic across networks while the NetLogic chips are used to examine the type of data on the network so that it can be processed more efficiently.  “It doesn’t bring us any new customers but it brings us new value for the customers we have,” McGregor said.  He said that Broadcom would continue to look for more acquisitions in the communications chip market.  It would cost a lot for Broadcom to build the NetLogic technology itself, Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree said.  “It’s a high premium but it’s a necessary premium. NetLogic has a huge amount potential,” Acree said. “They’ve developed a portfolio of products that’s unique and difficult for Broadcom to reproduce.”  Shares of NetLogic rival Cavium Inc were up 5 percent at $32.47 on Monday as some investors hoped Cavium could also attract a suitor. However, Acree said that a stronger NetLogic could make it more difficult for Cavium to compete.  The companies said the transaction has been approved by their respective boards and was expected to close in the first half of 2012.  Broadcom expects the deal to add 10 cents a share to earnings on an adjusted basis in 2012. It kept its forecast for third-quarter revenue of $1.9 billion to $2 billion, with product gross margins flat to slightly higher.  Broadcom said it expects to have around $4.2 billion in cash on hand by the end of third quarter, up from some $3.8 billion at the end of the second quarter.  In its latest quarterly report, NetLogic posted a 14.4 percent revenue increase to $98.7 million. Roughly 42 percent of revenue depends on network equipment sales in China.  NetLogic already sells chips to Cisco Systems Inc and Alcatel-Lucent and said in May that it expects Hewlett-Packard Co, Ericsson and ZTE to become major customers later this year as they increase spending on high-speed wireless technologies.  NetLogic shares were up 50.4 percent at $47.99 on Monday afternoon on the Nasdaq.

They accelerate our revenue growth and increase our market opportunity.”   Broadcom already sells different types of chips to the same network equipment makers that use NetLogic products. Broadcom chips help direct traffic across networks while the NetLogic chips are used to examine the type of data on the network so that it can be processed more efficiently.   “It doesn’t bring us any new customers but it brings us new value for the customers we have,” McGregor said.   He said that Broadcom would continue to look for more acquisitions in the communications chip market.   It would cost a lot for Broadcom to build the NetLogic technology itself, Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree said.   “It’s a high premium but it’s a necessary premium. NetLogic has a huge amount potential,” Acree said. “They’ve developed a portfolio of products that’s unique and difficult for Broadcom to reproduce.”   Shares of NetLogic rival Cavium Inc (CAVM.O) were up 5 percent at $32.47 on Monday as some investors hoped Cavium could also attract a suitor. However, Acree said that a stronger NetLogic could make it more difficult for Cavium to compete.   The companies said the transaction has been approved by their respective boards and was expected to close in the first half of 2012.   Broadcom expects the deal to add 10 cents a share to earnings on an adjusted basis in 2012. It kept its forecast for third-quarter revenue of $1.9 billion to $2 billion, with product gross margins flat to slightly higher.   Broadcom said it expects to have around $4.2 billion in cash on hand by the end of third quarter, up from some $3.8 billion at the end of the second quarter.   In its latest quarterly report, NetLogic posted a 14.4 percent revenue increase to $98.7 million. Roughly 42 percent of revenue depends on network equipment sales in China.   NetLogic already sells chips to Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) and Alcatel-Lucent ALUA.PA and said in May that it expects Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), Ericsson (ERICb.ST) and ZTE (000063.SZ) to become major customers later this year as they increase spending on high-speed wireless technologies.   NetLogic shares were up 50.4 percent at $47.99 on Monday afternoon on the Nasdaq.

88,CSCO,"Cisco slashes sales outlook, enters new era","SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc slashed its long-term forecasts, acknowledging an end to an era of scorching growth after cutting thousands of jobs in a sweeping four-month reorganization.  The reduction in projections had been expected from a company grappling with both nimbler rivals and a rickety global outlook for government and corporate tech spending. Yet investors pushed its shares 1.6 percent higher, relieved the overhaul was bearing fruit: reducing costs and setting Cisco on a path for slower but more stable growth.  CEO John Chambers in April launched a broad restructuring after declaring that the erstwhile Wall Street darling had lost its way. That included plans to reduce its workforce by about 15 percent — with nearly 13,000 taken off its payroll so far — and shutter its Flip video camera division.  Investors have turned cautiously optimistic at the pace with which the revamp has progressed. And on Tuesday, Chambers said customers he spoke to in the past 120 days had all pledged to either keep their spending with Cisco intact, or even increase it.  “Cisco was very upbeat. It sounds like their efforts in terms of streamlining the company and simplifying the structure are paying off and allowing the company to execute better at least in the near term,” Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu said.  Analysts generally applauded the speed with which Chambers has restructured the business in roughly 120 days.  Sources familiar with the situation told Reuters this week that the 62-year-old CEO is looking to end his 16-year run on a high note, with the company on firmer footing. They said speculation has centered around a succession by the likes of Silicon Valley veteran and Oracle president Mark Hurd once Cisco returns to stable growth.  “In terms of the board and the management team, we’re completely in sync,” Chambers said. “They asked me personally would I be willing to commit to another three years.”  Cisco — a bellwether for the networking industry because of its global, diverse clientele — shaved its long-term revenue growth target by roughly half to 5 percent to 7 percent from 12 to 17 percent previously. The new target was also below Cisco’s estimate for total market growth of 7 to 8 percent which raised eyebrows among some analysts.  But it forecast 2012 gross profit margins that were better than investors feared. Cisco also said earnings would grow at about 7 percent to 9 percent in the coming three years.  “Growing earnings faster than revenue is also a plus. This is Cisco’s new world,” said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis.  “Everybody knew the old targets were off the table. It’s not a surprise, it’s not as bad as it could have been.”  The company that once consistently clocked double-digit revenue growth is now comfortable with long-term single-digits. Analysts took heart however in a seeming confidence in its ability to protect margins against aggressively priced rivals.  Cisco’s forecast for a 2012 gross profit margin of 60 percent to 62 percent was marginally better than expected as some investors feared the number would dip below 60 percent. The company described its own forecast as “conservative.”  Rivals had undercut Cisco in past years, pressuring margins and chipping away at its market share. Analysts worry that efforts to ward off the competition might pressure margins.  Chambers declared war on Tuesday on rivals from Juniper Networks — which he said was at its most vulnerable — to China’s Huawei.  At Cisco’s annual analysts’ day, he vowed to battle Huawei on its home turf to bolster a global fight against the Chinese company, which he singled out as a “very tough” competitor.  Chambers also said he wants Cisco to generate 40 percent of its long-term growth from emerging markets versus 20 percent now. In the meantime, the executive said he was seeing positive signs from Cisco’s existing customers.  “I haven’t called on a customer with Cisco in the last 120 days who isn’t going to keep their spending with Cisco, or increase it,” Chambers told investors.  On Tuesday, Chambers said the company sees its total addressable markets — spanning everything from Internet routers to switching — growing some 7 percent to 8 percent annually on average in the next few years.  “In the last three years, there’s been limited EPS growth, but faster EPS growth is achievable,” said Auriga analyst Sandeep Shyamsukha. “We view more financial discipline and recent cost cuts as positive for shareholders.”  ",9132011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cisco/cisco-slashes-sales-outlook-enters-new-era-idUSTRE78C50K20110913

90,CSCO,Momentum grows for U.S. wireless spectrum bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Washington insiders have high hopes for legislation this year that would open up large swaths of spectrum to wireless companies desperate to meet the booming demand for data-heavy wireless devices.  Language giving the U.S. Federal Communications Commission authority to auction some airwaves currently held by TV broadcasters is popping up in bills in both chambers of Congress, as well as in President Barack Obama’s jobs plan.  Analysts say these incentive auctions, where some of the proceeds would go to the broadcasters giving up spectrum, are also likely to be part of the debate for the bipartisan congressional “super committee” tasked with slashing at least $1.2 trillion from the U.S. deficit over 10 years.  The Congressional Budget Office estimated auctions of TV spectrum would generate $24.5 billion, while Obama’s proposed jobs bill eyes some $28 billion in proceeds from the auctions.  “This is one of the rare instances where you see moving on an idea will actually generate revenues for the Treasury,” said Rhod Shaw, executive director of the High Tech Spectrum Coalition that includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Nokia Corp NOK1V.HE, Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) and Qualcomm Inc  (QCOM.O).  “The issue now becomes what is the final deal ... And I think there is a reason to believe this can actually get done.”  The need for a national, common communications system for first responders has added momentum to the debate.  First responders still cannot easily talk to emergency personnel outside of their division or unit a decade after airliners hijacked by al Qaeda operatives killed nearly 3,000 people.  “Shame on the Congress,” Representative Anna Eshoo, the top Democrat on the House Communications and Technology Subcommittee, told Reuters last week.  Auction proceeds not set aside for TV broadcasters giving up spectrum would help fund the construction and maintenance of a wireless public safety network. Any money left over after that would go toward reducing the U.S. budget deficit.  Although they failed to pass a bill before the symbolic September 11 date, Democrats say the momentum is there to get a bill signed this year.  Eshoo said she is hopeful her subcommittee is on the threshold of introducing bipartisan legislation for a nationwide broadband network for first responders.  Republicans are also keen to usher in improved communications capabilities for emergency personnel while generating revenue for deficit reduction.  “The nice thing is this discussion has not been should we do incentive auctions, it’s now how do we do incentive auctions,” said David Redl, counsel for the Republican-led House Energy and Commerce Committee.  Still, much of the talk about incentive auction authority is tied to the public safety network and lawmakers remain split on fundamental elements of its build-out.  Of particular contention is how to handle 10 megahertz of highly sought after airwaves called the D Block, which will provide the infrastructure for the network.  Generally, Democrats want to allocate the airwaves to public safety, while Republicans want to see it auctioned to a wireless company who would be required to give first responders priority access on its network during emergencies.  “It won’t be easy to come to a meeting-of-the-minds because you’re coming up on an election year,” said Medley Global Advisors analyst Jeffrey Silva.  But the revenue-generating potential of the auctions, coupled with the super committee’s need to find trillions of dollars in savings, left Silva believing there is a “decent chance” of passing public safety and incentive auction legislation this year.  “It’s a very powerful legislative vehicle for that legislation to ride on,” Silva added.

92,CSCO,Insight: Succession questions swirl around Cisco's Chambers,"(Reuters) - When John Chambers takes to the stage on Tuesday, many will be wondering if it is the last time the chief executive leads Cisco Systems Inc’s annual financial analyst conference.  After more than 16 years at the helm of the world’s largest network equipment maker, there is discussion both inside and outside Cisco that it is a matter of when — and not if — Chambers will cede the CEO job.  While Chambers, 62, still enjoys the support of the board and there is no formal CEO search under way, there is frustration in the company over the lack of a clear succession plan, according to people with knowledge of the situation.  Potential candidates have begun to lobby Cisco shareholders to build support, amid a general belief that the next leader will likely come from outside the company following the exodus of many senior executives in recent years.  The roster of possible CEO contenders being bandied about Silicon Valley include former Hewlett-Packard Co chief executive Mark Hurd and former Cisco executives Charles Giancarlo, Mike Volpi, Gary Daichendt and James Richardson.  Other industry executives who have also been mentioned as possible contenders for what would be one of technology’s most high-profile jobs include Juniper Networks Inc CEO Kevin Johnson, former McAfee CEO Dave DeWalt, and HP executive David Donatelli.  “The internal people at Cisco are having a massive war right now about potential succession,” said a source close to the company. “There is real tension about succession. Everybody knows it’s coming now.”  As for Chambers himself, he wants to end his tenure on a high note, which means he will not likely be stepping down until the company’s quarterly results are on firmer ground, said the source and another person close to the situation.  The first source said Chambers was looking for at least one strong quarter before he goes.  In February, Chambers spooked investors for the third time in as many quarters with a weak outlook, stoking concerns that the company had stretched itself too thin by making several large acquisitions in the consumer market.  Amid fears that Cisco has lost focus on its core business of making switchers and routers that direct Internet traffic, the company also faced intense competition from smaller rivals such as Juniper, Check Point Software Technologies, F5 Networks Inc and Riverbed Technology Inc.  In May, Cisco announced a corporate-wide reorganization after losing a number of top managerial talent, with Chambers admitting that the company has lost its way. In July, Cisco said it would cut 15 percent of its workforce, or 11,500 jobs.  In the run up to Tuesday’s analyst day, there is some renewed optimism on Wall Street that Cisco has moved past its worst quarters. Several analysts have upgraded their earnings estimates, with some noting that the customer franchise remains solid and complimented management’s speed at restructuring.  Cisco’s last set of quarterly results in August showed some stabilization of the business, though questions remained over long-term growth.  The stock has recovered a little since the results, though it is still down some 40 percent from a May 2010 high.  As Cisco has focused on cost cutting and on its core business, it is one of the few tech giants that has stayed out of — and some would say missed out on — the multibillion dollar mergers and acquisitions game this year.  “John’s wings have been clipped, mostly by the public market, not so much by the board,” said a former Cisco executive.  Still, the search for a successor would depend on Chambers’ willingness to step down. People who know him said Chambers would likely be more willing to relinquish the CEO reins if he could become chairman of the board, but that could put off potential successors who want autonomy.  “John very much likes being CEO of Cisco and it is not only what he has been doing for almost two decades, but I think it is the foundation of his political persona which I don’t think he wants to give up,” the former Cisco employee said.  Over the last few years Cisco has lost a number of key executives, including several who had been viewed as potential successors to Chambers.  Mike Volpi, who was in charge of service providers and routing, left in February 2007, followed by Charles Giancarlo, who was chief development officer. The following year, Jayshree Ullal, head of data center, switching and services, left.  In 2010, Cisco received another blow when high-profile executive Tony Bates was appointed the new CEO of Skype.  While Cisco’s executive bench still includes respected officials, such as Chief Strategy Officer Ned Hooper, the view from some people who follow the company is that the next CEO is more likely to come from outside.  “There doesn’t appear to be anyone within Cisco who is positioned to take over,” said a veteran tech banker.  Cisco has a succession plan but it has not been publicly disclosed, said two people familiar with the company.  Meanwhile, Cisco’s 12-member board have remained loyal to Chambers and his strategy. There is no “executive management move and search” underway, one of the people said.  As long as Chambers has the support of the board, it is difficult to predict when he might step down, but potential CEO candidates are trying to position themselves for a move in the next 12 to 18 months.  Several external candidates have reached out directly to some of Cisco’s shareholders, a majority of which are top U.S. institutional investors, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Mark Hurd is not one of the candidates lobbying for the support of Cisco’s investors, but a source familiar with the situation said third parties have made preliminary efforts to gauge Hurd’s interest in becoming Cisco’s CEO.  Hurd was credited with reviving HP by slashing costs and diversifying the technology giant through a string of high-profile acquisitions. He could bring that same tenacity and operational excellence to Cisco, supporters say.  But others questioned whether Hurd had the strategic vision to lead Cisco on its next phase of growth, and noted that he already had a good job working for Larry Ellison at Oracle Corp. Hurd is paid more than $70 million a year as Oracle’s co-president. Chambers earns about $17 million a year.  “Mark feels tremendous loyalty to Larry. He would have to get Larry’s permission if he were to do something like that and I am not even sure if he would want to approach Larry with it,” said a source close to Hurd.  Ellison hired Hurd last year after he quit HP following sexual harassment allegations made by a marketing contractor who worked for Hurd’s office from 2007 through 2009.  Hurd has little interest in charting out an exit strategy from Oracle, but an opportunity to lead tech bellwether Cisco would be worth considering for any executive, even if Chambers would remain as chairman, industry insiders said.  Cisco declined comment. The executives named in this story either declined to comment or could not be reached for comment.

Ellison hired Hurd last year after he quit HP following sexual harassment allegations made by a marketing contractor who worked for Hurd’s office from 2007 through 2009.   Hurd has little interest in charting out an exit strategy from Oracle, but an opportunity to lead tech bellwether Cisco would be worth considering for any executive, even if Chambers would remain as chairman, industry insiders said.   Cisco declined comment. The executives named in this story either declined to comment or could not be reached for comment.

Comments about possible new euro zone bonds to help ease the region’s debt crisis spurred early optimism, prompting an early rally in equities. However, those initial gains faded after an Austrian parliamentary panel failed to pass changes to a bailout fund, possibly delaying government approval until October.   The Dow fell as much as 1 percent, although officials said approval was not endangered.

Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and SanDisk Corp SNDK.O were the index’s top gainers, with Nvidia up 4.9 percent to $15.24 and SanDisk climbing 4 percent to $42.60.   Dell Inc DELL.O added 2.3 percent to $14.71 a day after its board authorized an additional $5 billion stock buyback program.

97,CSCO,Most Asian nations realizing Internet cannot be tamed,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - It’s not just dictators. Governments around the world, many of them popularly elected, have tried for years to control the Internet and social media, dismayed by their potential to incite violence, spread mischief and distribute pornography and dissent.  But in Asia, home to everything from free-wheeling democracies to totalitarian regimes and others in between, many governments are increasingly realizing that controlling online content, including dissent, just will not work.  Even China, which strongly regulates the Internet and is grappling with how to deal with the extremely popular microblogs read by hundreds of millions of its people, is highly unlikely to block them completely.  “Governments are committing quite a bit of resources and time to block websites and I think it’s a panic reaction,” says Phil Robertson, Bangkok-based deputy director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch.  “They have some temporary, immediate discouraging effect but over the longer term, they won’t be effective because people will still find a way to get the news they want to hear.  “Once people have been exposed to the Internet and see the power of getting information free to your computer, it’s a very addictive feeling of empowerment.”  That snowballing of sentiment has played out this year in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, where governments have been overthrown by movements bolstered by the Internet. The United States tried to block dissemination of the Wikileaks cables and British Prime Minister David Cameron threatened to temporarily censor social networking sites after riots last month.  Asia is also learning first-hand about the ubiquitous power of the wired world.  In India, authorities were taken aback last month when an anti-corruption campaign multiplied on Facebook, Twitter and other social networking sites and drew tens of thousands of people to protest sites.  But there were no signs the government tried in any way to crack down on the online crusade, even if it could have.  “At the rate in which it gained momentum, I don’t think the government actually had the time to ban the movement,” said Vijay Mukhi, a cyber-security expert.  Mukhi said the government did selectively block some sites, but added Internet users in a nation with millions of tech-savvy engineers and software developers could easily bypass controls.  “The Indian government doesn’t realize that blocking websites is a futile task because nowadays it has become so easy to find other means to get access to banned sites,” he said.  “They are just helping to popularize those particular sites and inviting more traffic.”  South Korea, the world’s most wired nation with 80 percent of households having access to the Internet, is one of two electoral democracies in the world to substantially block access to some sites, said a study on 37 countries this year by U.N.-funded watchdog Freedom House. The other is Turkey.  South Korea heavily filters online content involving North Korea, with which it is still technically at war. But its citizens continue to lobby the government for more access.  “No healthy democracy is possible where free speech is not tolerated,” said a letter earlier this month from the Electronic Frontier Foundation organization to the president.  “The expansive controls on online speech established in South Korea lack oversight and prevent citizens from accessing valuable expressive, historical, political and artistic online content,” the letter said.  Singapore blocks a symbolic list of 100 mostly pornographic sites but does not to bar any site for political content. And despite strict controls on open political discussion, it allowed freewheeling criticism of government policies in the run-up to general elections this year.  The ruling People’s Action Party easily won the election, but it scored its lowest ever percentage of the vote, and the opposition made historic gains.  Neighboring Malaysia pledged in 1996 not to impose controls on the Internet and was rewarded with investments from foreign technology companies such as Microsoft Corp and Cisco Systems.  The decision led to vibrant online political commentary. Analysts say the government had since quietly considered some form of filters on the debate, but decided against it.  “The government feels largely helpless in trying to manage online dissent because methods such as threatening to close down newspapers and targeting bloggers makes netizens angrier and more likely to lash out against the government,” said Ong Kian Ming, who teaches at UCSI University in Kuala Lumpur.  “Netizens have clearly been emboldened and it is hard to see how the government can try to turn this tide without reaping a lot of negative reaction,” said Ong.  Across much of Asia, the feeling is growing that imposing any sort of controls on online political debate backfires.  “Usually all it does is draw attention to the person and the message, who tend to be small players anyway,” said Cherian George, an associate professor at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University.  “The general pattern is that the blogger who gets censored becomes far more famous than he otherwise might be.  “The only situation where it might work in the short-term would be highly volatile, fast-moving situations.

99,CSCO,Tech start-up targets emerging corporate mobile mkt," HELSINKI, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Venture capital-backed telecom gear startup SpiderCloud Wireless aims to tap into the emerging market of small wireless networks which can be used inside offices, shopping centers and stadiums.	   Telecom operators around the world are struggling with a shortage of network capacity as the use of video on smartphones and tablets proliferates, and are seeking new solutions to the issue.	   Many of them have added new sites to manage the growing problem, but the technology just for a large base station can cost up to 40,000 euros ($55,000), while site and tower costs in towns could be much larger.	   By comparison a basic small cellsite costs as little as $100. Such sites can then by linked together with SpiderCloud’s technology, to be rolled out later on Monday,  replacing the need to buy additional large base stations.	   “We are seeing growing demand for ultra cheap, operator owned and managed small cell solutions for creating high speed mobile data coverage and capacity in enterprise environments,” said Pal Zarandy, a partner at Helsinki-based consultancy Rewheel, which advises operators on data strategy.	   Research firm Mobile Experts has forecast the market for such small cells to reach 7 million units in 2013 and grow to 15.5 million by 2016. 	   “There is a huge macro trend towards smaller cells,” said  Mike Gallagher, chief executive of SpiderCloud. “We can build a very big franchise here.”	   Analysts said the demand for solutions like SpiderCloud’s was growing, but warned it could still be a tough sell to large operators.	   “It would fit the job, but getting operators to buy in on it is still tough,” said Earl Lum, founder of research firm EJL Wireless.	   SpiderCloud said it was working with a few major operators already, but declined to give any names.	   CEO Gallagher is a former president of Flarion Technologies, which was sold to Qualcomm for $600 million in 2006, and has worked for several technology firms which have been sold over the years to bigger players like Nortel Networks.	   SpiderCloud is trying to find a niche in a market dominated by major firms like Ericsson (ERICb.ST), Nokia Siemens Networks  , Huawei and Alcatel-Lucent , but Gallagher said there was no plan for quick sale.   “It would be nice to take one public,” said Gallagher.

102,CSCO,"Oracle expects strong Q2, firms up tech outlook","(Reuters) - Oracle Corp forecast earnings for the current quarter that are higher than expected, as well as robust software sales, offering some reassurance to investors hoping that global technology spending is holding up.  Its shares rose 3 percent after it said new software sales, a gauge of future profit because they generate high-margin long-term service contracts, increased 17 percent in its first fiscal quarter, ended August 31. Analysts had expected 15 percent.  Oracle also forecast software sales growth for the current quarter in a range of 6 percent to 16 percent, which was much higher than the flat to 10 percent estimated by ThinkEquity analyst Brian Schwartz.  Executives also said they are confident of market share gains against rivals such as SAP in Europe, a region that along with the Middle East and Africa accounts for a third of its business but is grappling with a widening economic crisis.  “I’m certainly encouraged by that license revenue growth. In the near term that’s a very positive indicator,” Schwartz said, even as he noted that the company’s overall revenue forecast was lighter than expected.  Oracle forecast a 4 percent to 8 percent gain in revenue this quarter, translating into sales of $9 billion to $9.3 billion, slightly lagging forecasts of $9.36 billion.  It also forecast earnings before one-time items of 56 cents to 58 cents per share for the current quarter, compared with the 56 cents expected by Wall Street.  The outlook for worldwide technology spending darkened after warnings by major technology vendors from Dell Inc to Cisco Systems Inc. Governments are scaling back purchases to reduce deficits while corporations are tightening budgets to cope with an uncertain economic picture.  Oracle, which competes with SAP in selling software to corporations and public agencies, reports results a month before its rivals — giving investors a first peek at July and August this year — and is watched for the latest insights into industry trends.  A stronger-than-expected European performance — partly credited by executives to market share gains against arch foe SAP — helped boost sales last quarter.  However, Richard Davis, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, noted that the European countries in most trouble — Greece, Ireland and Spain — were not key markets anyway. “They’re doing well in the markets where they should be doing well,” he said.  The company, which is run by flamboyant Silicon Valley billionaire Larry Ellison, on Tuesday reported revenue of $8.37 billion for the fiscal first quarter. This is just a touch ahead of Wall Street’s estimate of $8.35 billion and up 11.6 percent from $7.50 billion in the year-ago period.  “We just had a solid quarter in Europe,” said President Mark Hurd. “I would be cautious that this may not be macro but maybe more Oracle-specific. We’re hiring in Europe.”  As well as software, Oracle sells server computers following its purchase of Sun Microsystems last year. Overall hardware sales — a weak spot in Oracle’s otherwise robust numbers — slipped 1 percent to $1.67 billion, lighter than expected as the company sacrificed sales for profitability.  The company said it expects another weak quarter for hardware and forecast sales in a range of flat to down 5 percent in the current quarter.  “The outlook seemed fine,” said Canaccord’s Davis. “They’ve done this three quarters now — slightly lower revenue growth and better margin growth. They’re doing the right thing. We’ll see how it plays out but for now they’re in good shape.”  Margins climbed to 54 percent from 48 percent in the previous quarter, reflecting a strategy of moving toward higher-end servers and relinquishing volume sales growth.  Net income rose to $1.84 billion, or 36 cents share, from $1.35 billion, or 27 cents a share, in the same quarter the year before.  Excluding unusual items, Oracle earned 48 cents per share compared with analysts’ expectations of 46 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

103,CSCO,"UPDATE 4-Oracle expects strong Q2, firms up tech outlook"," * Sees Q2 EPS ex-items of 56-58 cts, vs Street’s 56 cts   * Q1 software sales up 17 pct, hardware rev down 1 pct   * Q1 EPS ex-items 48 cts, vs 46 cts expected by Wall St   * Shares rise 3 percent after hours  (Adds executive’s comments)   By Sinead Carew and Edwin Chan   Sept 20 (Reuters) - Oracle Corp ORCL.O forecast earnings for the current quarter that are higher than expected, as well as robust software sales, offering some reassurance to investors hoping that global technology spending is holding up.   Its shares rose 3 percent after it said new software sales, a gauge of future profit because they generate high-margin long-term service contracts, increased 17 percent in its first fiscal quarter, ended Aug. 31. Analysts had expected 15 percent.   Oracle also forecast software sales growth for the current quarter in a range of 6 percent to 16 percent, which was much higher than the flat to 10 percent estimated by  ThinkEquity analyst Brian Schwartz.   Executives also said they are confident of market share gains against rivals such as SAP (SAPG.DE) in Europe, a region that along with the Middle East and Africa accounts for a third of its business but is grappling with a widening economic crisis.   “I’m certainly encouraged by that license revenue growth. In the near term that’s a very positive indicator,” Schwartz said, even as he noted that the company’s overall revenue forecast was lighter than expected.   Oracle forecast a 4 percent to 8 percent gain in revenue this quarter, translating into sales of $9 billion to $9.3 billion, slightly lagging forecasts of $9.36 billion.   It also forecast earnings before one-time items of 56 cents to 58 cents per share for the current quarter, compared with the 56 cents expected by Wall Street.   The outlook for worldwide technology spending darkened after warnings by major technology vendors from Dell Inc DELL.O to Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O). Governments are scaling back purchases to reduce deficits while corporations are tightening budgets to cope with an uncertain economic picture.   Oracle, which competes with SAP in selling software to corporations and public agencies, reports results a month before its rivals — giving investors a first peek at July and August this year — and is watched for the latest insights into industry trends.   A stronger-than-expected European performance — partly credited by executives to market share gains against arch foe SAP — helped boost sales last quarter.   However, Richard Davis, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity,  noted that the European countries in most trouble — Greece, Ireland and Spain — were not key markets anyway. “They’re doing well in the markets where they should be doing well,” he said.   The company, which is run by flamboyant Silicon Valley billionaire Larry Ellison, on Tuesday reported revenue of $8.37 billion for the fiscal first quarter. This is just a touch ahead of Wall Street’s estimate of $8.35 billion and up 11.6 percent from $7.50 billion in the year-ago period.   “We just had a solid quarter in Europe,” said President Mark Hurd. “I would be cautious that this may not be macro but maybe more Oracle-specific. We’re hiring in Europe.”   As well as software, Oracle sells server computers following its purchase of Sun Microsystems last year. Overall hardware sales — a weak spot in Oracle’s otherwise robust numbers — slipped 1 percent to $1.67 billion, lighter than expected as the company sacrificed sales for profitability.   The company said it expects another weak quarter for hardware and forecast sales in a range of flat to down 5 percent in the current quarter.   “The outlook seemed fine,” said Canaccord’s Davis. “They’ve done this three quarters now — slightly lower revenue growth and better margin growth. They’re doing the right thing. We’ll see how it plays out but for now they’re in good shape.”   Margins climbed to 54 percent from 48 percent in the previous quarter, reflecting a strategy of moving toward higher-end servers and relinquishing volume sales growth.   Net income rose to $1.84 billion, or 36 cents share, from $1.35 billion, or 27 cents a share, in the same quarter the year before.   Excluding unusual items, Oracle earned 48 cents per share compared with analysts’ expectations of 46 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   The company also announced a quarterly cash dividend of 6 cents per share to be paid Nov. 2.   Shares  of the world’s No. 3 software maker rose 3 percent to $29.25 in extended trading, after closing down 2.3 percent at $28.35 on the Nasdaq.

104,CSCO,COLUMN-Green indices muddy sustainable investing-Gerard Wynn," (Gerard Wynn is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own)	   By Gerard Wynn	   LONDON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Sustainability data can help spot winners in a future, greener economy, but only with active political lobbying to abolish fossil fuels subsidies, for example, as sagging equity markets revive talk of alternative investment approaches.  	   Environmental social and governance (ESG) data measure performance in areas like health and safety, labour rights, corruption and transparency on carbon emissions reporting. 	   ESG leaders can out-perform in equity markets, as related indices point to quick-witted, high-achieving companies. 	   The rapid response of Puma, Adidas and Nike to Greenpeace demands to halt discharge of toxins into Chinese rivers illustrated ESG awareness in leading companies. 	   Such companies want to be seen as green, but whether they are is more complicated.	   That uncertainty is reflected in broad ESG indices which may claim to be sustainable but use broad criteria which could please many but fail to capture anything precise. 	   The UK green group Forum for the Future and the investment arm of insurers Aviva PLC published a report this month which tried to capture what types of companies would flourish in a sustainable economy of 2040.	   Such companies may underperform now, given government policies and resource limits may still disadvantage them.	   The low-carbon sector, one narrow aspect of ESG, has underperformed oil and gas and wider benchmarks, see chart below. 	   Active lobbying must accompany sustainable investing: G20 governments pledged to abolish fossil fuel subsidies two years ago, but that promise is unfulfilled despite prodding by the International Energy Agency (IEA).	   The Aviva/Forum for the Future report pictured how five key sectors - food, health, energy, mobility and finance - should look in 30 years time, for example in resource efficiency and social justice. 	   	   Broad green indices apply sustainability criteria across a wide range of stocks, to catch a wide, investable mix. The approach can yield inconsistent results. 	   The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) has over the past nine years successfully pressed the world’s biggest companies to reveal environmental strategies by sending a questionnaire and publishing the answers.	   In its global 500 report last week, it suggested “a strong correlation” between returns on investment in a company’s shares and an index which measures corporate fulfilment of emissions targets.	   The top leaders in the index were Philips Electronics, BMW, Honda Motor Company, Tesco, Bank of America, Westpac Banking Corporation, Bayer, Cisco Systems, SAP and Sony Corporation. 	   Philips and Cisco are positioning in energy efficiency but it’s hard to explain all these low-carbon leaders. 	   Among automakers, BMW makes just two and Honda none of the 72 low carbon-emission models qualifying for zero road tax in Britain, according to the Vehicle Certification Agency. 	   The Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) identified three identical companies including Philips and BMW in its 19 “supersector leaders”, based on a broad questionnaire ranging from gender equality to remuneration transparency. 	   The DJSI has performed well compared with world stocks.	   How to make indices, or ESG data, deliver something more precise is the challenge.	   A sector-specific approach, for example focused on wind, solar or energy efficiency, runs the obvious problem of a less liquid group. HSBC has selected companies which make revenues from climate change-related themes, for a broader base.	   But sector approaches also risk losing broader sustainability themes such as corporate governance and social responsibility, and dropping ESG leaders. Governance in particular, the checks and balances of how a company is run, is key to performance. 	   Active investors argue that in sustainability, in particular, a discriminating, hands-on approach is needed, using ESG data and FTSE Group-type scoring to spot companies more likely to thrive in a sustainable world with tougher social governance and environmental laws.

107,CSCO,Poor nations urged to tap Web fast for growth," * Developing nations missing out on Web as growth driver   * Creation of infrastructure should be top priority   * High fees and taxes will deter undersea cable links    By Duncan Miriri	   NAIROBI, Sept 30 (Reuters) - With online business increasingly driving economic growth, developing nations’ top priority should be the infrastructure their citizens need to get connected, delegates at an Internet conference in Nairobi said this week.	   The Internet’s potential to raise living standards is under-exploited in the developing world, where just 21 percent of the population have access, compared with 69 percent in the developed world.	   In a study published earlier this year, consultancy Mckinsey found that the Internet accounted for 21 percent of economic growth in mature economies, and that almost $8 trillion changes hands through e-commerce each year.	   But regions such as Africa, lacking the broadband infrastructure mature economies enjoy, have an uphill struggle to encourage telecoms operators to invest in the mobile networks needed to bring the Internet to the masses — especially when the masses have little disposable income to repay their investment.	   “There is no way developing countries should sit back and wait, because online activities are driving offline activities,” said Joe Mucheru, head of Google in Sub-Saharan Africa.	   Participants at the United Nations-sponsored Internet Governance Forum said there was a need to expand infrastructure such as undersea cables and wireless networks for markets where the primary mode of connection to the Web is by mobile phone.	   Increased bandwidth capacity and increased competition will cut prices and allow more people to get connected, government officials and company executives attending the forum said.	   Some Western telecoms operators facing stagnation at home are prepared to make big bets on connecting developing nations; France Telecom , under the brand name Orange, is seeking to double its revenue in the Middle East and Africa to 7 billion euros ($9.5 billion) in the coming years.	   It is already present in Egypt, Tunisia, Senegal and Kenya, among other African countries. One of its present projects is the building of an undersea cable to improve Internet connectivity in west Africa.	   “We’ve prioritised spending on the undersea cables, since that will really be a vast improvement to what is currently available,” said Thierry Bonhomme, head of networks at France Telecom.	   Today, much of Africa’s Internet traffic is delivered via satellites, which have far less capacity and connectivity than the intercontinental cables that are slowly being built.	   In Nigeria, it costs $1,100 to buy capacity per megabyte on the Lagos to Abuja link — nearly double the $600 it costs to buy the same capacity on the much longer Lagos to London link, due to the lack of internal infrastructure once the signal reaches Africa.	   Executives of cable operators there have been lobbying the government to formulate forward-looking policies that can help cut the costs of moving capacity within the country.  	   Bitange Ndemo, the top official at Kenya’s ministry of communication, says the answer lies in the construction of a national fibre network to take capacity brought on submarine cables to homes and businesses.	   “I ask you to make (access) to this resource (high-speed Internet) a human rights issue,” Ndemo told participants at the meeting.	   “If access to broadband is declared a human rights issue, then governments will step in and invest so no human being is left behind.”	   The east African nation, whose approach to provision of communication infrastructure and industry-friendly regulations was promoted by delegates to the conference as a viable model for other developing nations, is in the process of putting up a next-generation LTE network — more advanced than most developed economies can boast — to be run by several firms.	   The mobile phone is the primary tool of access to the Internet in Africa, driving some handset makers such as Nokia  to incorporate Web functions into their latest low-priced models aimed at the continent. 	   In light of that, Robert Pepper, vice president for global technology policy at Cisco Systems , said African nations could increase access to the Web by switching off analogue television in favour of digital TV and using the spectrum used by TV stations for wireless Internet networks.	   Nations that impose steep taxes and levies on landing rights for firms that are building submarine cables connecting the continent with the outside world will miss out as the cable operators bypass such nations, delegates to the forum warned.	   “Traditionally, international telecom firms were seen as a source of foreign investment and international currencies. Now, if governments have high fees and taxes for cable landings, operators will just by-pass those countries,” said Cisco’s Pepper.

108,CSCO,Emerson unit head says IT executives wary of spending,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Economic troubles in the United States and Europe are making customers of Emerson Electric Co’s data center management business reluctant to make big purchases as the company prepares to launch a major new platform.  Steve Hassell, head of Avocent, part of Emerson’s network power segment, said on Monday that IT executives were reconsidering their short-term spending plans due to economic uncertainty and a deepening financial crisis in Europe.  “You have people that have needs that are just saying, ‘I want to wait and see,’” Hassell said. “There’s uncertainty out there due to a whole lot of different economic pieces and it’s making everything murky.”  Speaking to Reuters at Oracle’s annual OpenWorld conference in San Francisco, Hassell said about 10 major “early adopter” customers were using Emerson’s new Trellis platform, which manages demand and resources in data centers to improve their efficiency.  When Trellis is launched early next year, he said, customers can easily adopt portions of it gradually rather than the entire system all at once, making the transition less expensive.  “We’re going to be a substantial player in the DCIM (data center infrastructure management) market place,” Hassell said when asked about revenue targets for Trellis.  The outlook for worldwide technology spending has darkened in recent months, with warnings by major technology vendors from Dell Inc to Cisco Systems Inc. Governments are scaling back purchases to reduce deficits while corporations are tightening budgets to cope with an uncertain economic picture.  St. Louis-based Emerson in the last decade has transformed itself from an old-line maker of motors to a high-tech supplier of power and cooling systems for corporate computer centers.  Trellis is Emerson’s big bet in the small but growing data center infrastructure management market. The platform lets companies cut their energy bills and infrastructure spending, and better allocate staff at the giant server farms that manage everything from bank transactions to corporate payrolls.  The 2009 acquisition of Avocent, a maker of access and control systems, for $1.2 billion provided the technology Emerson needed to develop Trellis.

110,CSCO,Siemens Enterprise CEO says orders stabilizing,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Siemens Enterprise Communications Inc, a provider of communications equipment and software to corporations, is seeing demand stabilize after a severe collapse in orders earlier this year, according to the company’s chief executive officer.  The company, which generates about 70 percent of its revenue in Europe, saw customers take more than three times as long as usual to make purchasing decisions because of economic concerns, CEO Hamid Akhavan told Reuters.  The executive said some customers are taking more than 330 days to close big technology supply contracts compared with a more typical sales cycle of 90 days to 100 days.  “The fact there is so much back and forth shows people are very careful about how they spend,” he said, noting that contracts for more than $5 million were the slowest but that even $1 million contracts were taking up to eight months to close, about twice as long as in a normal economy.  Akhavan said the biggest drop in demand was in January this year, and since then the market has appeared to stabilize.  “I believe that the worst is behind us,” he said. “Businesses have held up for so long they can’t hold off any longer. People have to start renovating ... I just don’t see it getting any slower.”  The worst decline in sales was in southern Europe, with a 30 percent drop in revenue in Spain, while northern European markets were also hurting, according to Akhavan, who also noted a single-digit decline in sales in Germany and a decline of about 10 percent to 15 percent in the United Kingdom.  The company, which is 49 percent owned by Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) and 51 percent owned by private equity firm Gores Group, competes with companies like Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), privately held Avaya and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).  Siemens Enterprise generated roughly 2.2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in annual revenue for its fiscal year 2011, which ended in September. This was about 2-3 percent lower than 2010 revenue, excluding items such as divestitures, according to Akhavan.  However, the executive said he is happy with current staffing levels of about 11,000 people at his company and has no plans for layoffs despite the tough economic conditions.  Earlier this year the company told Reuters that a U.S. initial public offering was a potential strategic option for the company. But Akhavan said on Wednesday that Gores is in no rush for a public listing in a difficult market.  “There is absolutely no sense of urgency for an accelerated exit.” he said.  Akhavan said he would be interested in participating in mergers in the future but added that any deals would be aimed at improving the company’s customer base or expanding its sales force or distribution rather than adding new products.  “We’ve a very good portfolio. I don’t think we’d do it to enhance the portfolio,” he said.  ",10052011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-siemensenterprise/siemens-enterprise-ceo-says-orders-stabilizing-idUSTRE7944TE20111005
111,CSCO,Fitch slams proposed foreign profit tax break,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Giving corporations a tax break on their overseas profits likely would not boost the economy or jobs, said credit rating agency Fitch Inc on Thursday after two senators unveiled a tax “holiday” bill.  The Fitch statement echoed two other studies released on Tuesday that reached the same conclusion — a stark contrast with the picture painted by Republican Senator John McCain of the legislation he introduced with Democrat Kay Hagan.  The lawmakers appeared at a news conference to discuss their measure, which offers two possible reduced tax rates for repatriating, or bringing into the United States, earnings now stashed abroad avoiding the 35 percent corporate income tax.  Under the bipartisan Hagan-McCain bill, multinationals could repatriate foreign profits at an 8.75 percent tax rate or, if they boost hiring, at 5.25 percent. Corporations are sitting on an estimated $1.5 trillion in overseas profits. (For a Reuters Insider interview with Hagan: r.reuters.com/qem34s)  McCain said his bill would be offered as an amendment to President Barack Obama’s jobs package when that measure arrives in the Senate, if the Democratic Senate leadership does not explicitly include the tax provision in the jobs package.  The Obama administration reiterated its refusal to consider a foreign profit tax break on its own.  Citing past statements on the issue by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, a Treasury spokeswoman on Wednesday said, “We won’t consider tax relief for repatriated earnings outside the context of broader corporate tax reform.”  The Hagan-McCain bill is seen as having little chance of passage as a stand-alone item, but it could be an important bargaining chip as lawmakers and the administration grapple with deficit reduction, tax reform and job creation.  Though small and mid-sized firms have little stake in the matter, big multinationals keenly desire the overseas income tax break. It could be a valuable carrot for Democrats to dangle in seeking support for closing tax loopholes that would raise new revenues and clean up the tax code, analysts said.  Corporate lobbyists trying to spin the tax break as a form of stimulus took another blow from Fitch on Thursday, however.  “Proposed legislation to provide a temporary tax holiday for U.S. firms repatriating foreign earnings is unlikely, if passed, to support growth-oriented investment by U.S. firms,” said Fitch, a top global credit rater, in a statement.  “Fitch expects most firms benefiting from the proposed repatriation tax relief, notably large multinational companies in the technology and pharmaceutical sectors, to prioritize share repurchases at a time when cash balances are strong and capital spending plans are increasingly uncertain,” it said.  Multinationals have been pushing for months for the tax break, hoping to replay a similar Bush administration holiday.  In 2004-2005, in the first overseas corporate profit repatriation tax holiday, 843 corporations brought home $362 billion in overseas income at a 5.25 percent tax rate. Without the holiday, they would have had to pay 35 percent in tax.  As they are doing now, proponents of the tax break six years ago represented it as a boost to jobs and the economy, but numerous studies have raised doubts about this.  Reports released on Tuesday by two think tanks said the 2004-2005 tax break did little or nothing to boost the economy or create jobs, despite promises that it would, and said that another such tax break would likely have the same outcome, going to bonuses and dividends rather than new investments.  Spanning the ideological spectrum, one of the studies this week came from the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies; the other from the conservative Heritage Foundation.  The Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan research arm of Congress, has estimated that another tax holiday like the one in 2004-2005 would boost government revenues at first, but eventually cost taxpayers about $78.7 billion over 10 years.  Hagan-McCain would slap a penalty on corporations that repatriate profits from overseas and then cut payrolls. The penalty would be $75,000 per full-time position eliminated.  The 2004-2005 tax break had similar sanctions, but studies have shown that companies found ways to get around them.  Calling the bill “a critical step forward in the effort to jump-start our economic recovery,” WIN America campaign director Karen Olick said it would cause “upwards of $1 trillion” to be brought into the country by businesses.  WIN America is a coalition of companies — including high-tech giants Apple Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Oracle Corp and Microsoft Corp — that is lobbying Congress for the income tax break.  Similar legislation has already been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Kevin Brady, a House Republican.  McCain, a former presidential candidate who seldom takes a lead role in business and economic legislation, said his bill would pump between $50 billion and $80 billion of tax revenue into the U.S. Treasury and create 2 million jobs.  To get the extra-low tax rate of 5.25 percent, under the bill, companies would have to increase “qualified payroll” by 10 percent or more. Qualified payroll means all wages paid to employees that are subject to payroll tax, the senators said.

114,CSCO,Foreign profits tax break gets boost in US Senate,"   * Senators Hagan, McCain introduce dual-track legislation   * Multinationals would get tax break on overseas earnings   * Proposal likely to factor in deficit, tax reform debate   By Kevin Drawbaugh   WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Corporations seeking a tax break on overseas profits scored a win on Thursday in the U.S. Senate with the introduction of a bill offering two possible reduced tax rates for repatriating earnings from abroad.   Senators Kay Hagan and John McCain unveiled bipartisan legislation that would let multinationals bring foreign profits into the country at an 8.75 percent tax rate or, if they boost hiring, at 5.25 percent. The statutory rate is 35 percent.   McCain, a Republican, said the bill would be offered as an amendment to President Barack Obama’s jobs package when that measure arrives in the Senate, if Democratic Senate leadership does not on its own include the tax provision in the package.   The Hagan-McCain bill is seen as having little chance of passage on its own, but it could be an important bargaining chip as lawmakers and the Obama administration grapple with deficit reduction, tax reform and job creation.   Corporations that have been pushing for months for the tax break applauded the proposal, formally titled the Foreign Earnings Reinvestment Act 2011.   It would slap a penalty on corporations that repatriate profits from overseas and then cut payrolls. The penalty would be $75,000 per full-time position eliminated.   Calling the bill “a critical step forward in the effort to jump-start our economic recovery,” WIN America campaign director Karen Olick said it would cause “upwards of $1 trillion” to be brought into the country by businesses.   WIN America is a coalition of multinationals —  including high-tech giants Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), Oracle Corp ORCL.O and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) — lobbying Congress for a tax break like Hagan-McCain.   Similar legislation has already been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Kevin Brady, a House Republican. It has support from some Democrats. Hagan is a Democrat.   McCain said at a news conference he held with Hagan that their bill would pump between $50 billion and $80 billion of tax revenue into the U.S. Treasury and create 2 million jobs.

118,CSCO,Polycom plunges on competitor worries,"(Reuters) - Polycom Inc PLCM.O shares fell by more than a third on Thursday, a day after the videoconferencing company forecast dismal fourth-quarter sales in the face of slow corporate spending and increased competition from rivals like Cisco Systems (CSCO.O). Polycom, led by former Cisco sales chief and Tandberg CEO Andy Miller, has recently stumbled with competitive pressures and cautious customer spending, taking the shine off its stock. Polycom shares fell to $14.45 in heavy early-morning trading, making it the top loser on Nasdaq on Thursday. Excluding Thursday’s losses, they have fallen 29 percent since Polycom reported second-quarter results on July 21. “We believe the competitive environment has changed with Cisco (CSCO.O) executing better and (China’s) Huawei targeting the European market,” Piper Jaffray said in a research note and lowered his rating to “neutral” from “overweight.” Several other brokerages lowered their price targets on the stock. On Thursday morning, Cisco said it acquired privately-held BNI Video, a video back-office and content-delivery network analytics company, further entrenching itself in videoconferencing — a goal it has set for itself as it shakes off recent operational troubles. Polycom, which had primed itself to take advantage of Cisco’s problems and recently bought Hewlett Packard’s (HPQ.N) videoconferencing business, is facing investor scrutiny following partner and competitor Microsoft’s (MSFT.O) acquisition of Skype in May. The competition has also heated up with European rival Logitech LOGN.VX recently acquiring Italian firm Mirial to beef up its mobile video services and start-up Vidyo rolling out a low-cost product in June. “The window of opportunity that Polycom had to capture share has closed given Cisco’s improved execution, and we believe the videoconferencing market will be more competitive going forward,” Piper Jaffray said. The brokerage said the videoconferencing market appeared more discretionary than it had previously thought, and lowered its rating on Polycom’s stock to “neutral” from “overweight.” Polycom could not close some key transactions in the third quarter as customers took more time to finalize deals and it conceded its sales strategy needed improving. “The sales infrastructure is being repaired and mis-execution is likely to be a temporary issue, in our view,” Wedbush Securities said in a research note. Wedbush, which cut its price target on Polycom’s stock to $23 from $28, said management had reset the forecast bar at an achievable level, better reflecting the deteriorating IT spending environment. “We are disappointed in management’s inability to communicate these issues earlier, and we acknowledge this has become a “show me” story once again,” it said.

119,CSCO,Global cloud data traffic growing rapidly: Cisco,"(Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc said global cloud data traffic will grow at a compound annual rate of 66 percent between 2010 and 2015, as consumers and businesses seek untethered access to content and applications. By mid-decade more than a third of all data center traffic will be based in the cloud, which allows data to be stored and accessed remotely, Cisco said in its first annual Global Cloud Index published on Tuesday. Gobal data center traffic overall will increase four-fold, a 33 percent compound annual growth rate between 2010 and 2015, according to Cisco. That translates into data traffic of 4.8 zettabytes per year by 2015 or every man, woman and child watching a full length movie once a day for one year. “What was surprising is how much data is actually being moved, we started off with a zettabyte,” said Suraj Shetty, vice president of product and solutions marketing, referring to 2010 when annual data traffic worldwide was at 1.1 zettabyte, which equals a trillion gigabytes. “The evolution of cloud services is driven in large part by users’ expectations to access applications and content anytime, from anywhere, over any network and with any device,” Cisco said. Economic considerations were also a significant factor, Shetty said, because cloud-based data centers could support more virtual machines and workloads than traditional data centers making remote storage more cost-efficient. Cisco, which offers technology to build, deploy and use cloud services, expects that, by 2014, more than 50 percent of all workloads will be processed in the cloud. IT research firm Forrester has forecast the global cloud computing market will grow to $241 billion in 2020 from $41 billion this year. However, it will still take some time and investments in network expansion until networks around the world are ready to handle advanced cloud services. All regions can currently support some level of cloud services based on average download and upload speeds and the time it takes for information to pass through the network for business and consumer connections, Cisco said. “However, few regions’ average network characteristics are currently able to support the high-end advanced cloud apps,” Cisco added. Basic cloud applications include email, Web browsing or social networking, while advanced cloud services, which have higher network requirements, include advanced gaming and high definition video conferencing. For the forecast Cisco collected network data from 10 enterprise and Internet data centers for 12 months.

121,CSCO,Analysis: Cisco set on proving it can succeed in tablet market,"(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc is stepping up its push to sell its Cius tablet computers to corporate customers, defying skeptics who say the product is short of the sex appeal and brand recognition it would need to win over the workforce. In a sign of its confidence, Cisco says it will soon introduce a 4G version of the Cius, an upgrade to the 7-inch tablet computer that it began shipping to corporate customers in August. Cius, which plugs into a phone docking station, is built on Google Inc’s Android operating software. Whether Cisco’s confidence is misplaced remains to be seen. By most accounts, it faces a number of challenges when it comes to selling Cius, not the least of which is that few people seem familiar with the brand. Chuck Fontana, Cisco’s head of product management, acknowledged that “people hardly know it exists because you can’t get it at Best Buy, but this is not a device you get for your teenager.” Even with better brand recognition, there is a question of whether it has come too late to a market currently dominated by Apple Inc’s iPad, which is both bigger and lighter than the Cius. Still, Cisco, a network equipment maker, contends that Cius will appeal to corporations because of its advanced security options and features that allow customers to manage data or erase sensitive corporate documents remotely. Cisco can also point to a handful of other appealing details: The Cius offers advanced video conferencing and functions as a phone on-the-go, while giving users access to games and media. Cisco declined to say how many tablets it has sold so far but said about a thousand company customers have begun using Cius in the last three months. Among them, healthcare group Kaiser Permanente has been using Cius, and South African telecom company MTN is rolling it out to its workforce, Fontana said. For the new 4G version, Cisco has partnered with AT&T; Inc and next spring it plans to offer a Verizon Wireless enabled version and more models with different screen sizes. “You’re always late in tech,” said Fontana. “But this is really innovative.” There are doubts, however, that Cius can win over corporations in a world where employees increasingly want to bring a device of their choice to work. “We can see that Cisco believes enterprise communication is evolving toward tablets, but find it hard to believe that most people will end up using Cisco tablets for that purpose,” J.P. Morgan analyst Rod Hall said in a note. Carolina Milanesi of Gartner research agreed. “As an employee you want a tablet that was created as a tablet, one that’s sexy not one that’s coming from desk phones.” Traditionally, employees have expected to have little say when it comes to technology they use in the workplace. That is changing, according to research that shows the freedom to choose devices is becoming key factor in job satisfaction. Some 40 percent of college students and 45 percent of young professionals would choose a lower paying job if it allowed device flexibility, among other things, over a higher paying job, a recent study published by Cisco itself showed. Gartner’s Milanesi said that Cisco could potentially manage to corner a small part of the tablet market but that she was not sold on its approach. “We are not great believers in a tablet as a phone to take with you,” she said, adding that among the 58 million to 60 million tablets estimated to be shipped this year the Cius was “really a drop in the ocean”. Cisco isn’t the only one betting — rightly or wrongly — on demand for a business-specific tablet. Research in Motion Ltd. launched the Blackberry Playbook but has had disappointing sales. Hewlett Packard’s Slate and Dell Inc’s Latitude, both of which run Windows 7, are also entrants in the market. But they are geared more towards healthcare, education or retail workers who need a mobile device for charts or payments. Next year Microsoft Corp is expected to launch a tablet. “My concern with anyone targeting a niche market is that consumer tablets are going to be good enough to target any sector ... if you want to do anything in the enterprise you’re going to have to have a lot of pluses,” Milanesi said. It makes some sense for Cisco to try to succeed in the tablet market, Milanesi said, but sticking to the software route may be better. “We like most of Cisco’s other initiatives lately but find the continued development of tablets an unnecessary sideshow to the real business of protecting and growing the switching and routing businesses”. J.P. Morgan’s Hall said. ",12022011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cisco/analysis-cisco-set-on-proving-it-can-succeed-in-tablet-market-idUSTRE7B127I20111202
122,CSCO,JP Morgan upgrades Cisco to overweight;shares rise,"(Reuters) - Investment bank JPMorgan upgraded its recommendation for Cisco Systems to “overweight” and raised its price target for the network equipment maker on expectations of a rebound in public sector spending and improved margins in 2012. Cisco stock was up 3.4 percent to $18.65 in midday trading in New York on Tuesday. “Our proprietary analysis of 30 U.S. federal agency budgets implies that spending will increase in FY’12 after being down in FY’11 and may act as a tailwind for Cisco,” JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall said in a note. “As a result, we believe Cisco represents a relatively safe haven for communications equipment investors,” Hall added. JPMorgan raised its price target for Cisco shares to $21 from $19. The problems Cisco encountered in 2011 were a number of small issues that resulted in a year-on-year decline in gross margins, Hall said, adding that it was not likely to happen this year because those problems have been addressed by the company.

123,CSCO,Cisco shelves home telepresence amid company revamp,"(Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems has decided to pull the plug on umi, a home video conferencing system it once touted as a quality alternative to popular video chat service Skype — as it continues with its restructuring plans. The San Jose, California-based company kicked off a months-long overhaul last year that has included layoffs and asset sales. Cisco said in an email on Wednesday in response to blogs that it had decided to no longer sell Cisco umi hardware as a consumer offering. In April Cisco said it would shut down its popular Flip video camera division as part of a larger revamp. As of Wednesday afternoon, Cisco had yet to remove the product from its home product store, where interested customers were told only that the product was currently not available for shipment. Just a little more than two months ago, Cisco announced that the umi system would be available in Best Buy’s Magnolia Home Theaters in time for the holiday shopping season. “While we are ending the sale of umi, the umi service remains unchanged,” Cisco said, adding that existing customers will continue to be able to use the service to make calls to other umi subscribers or to Google video chat accounts. Some users worried what the decision would mean for them. “Let’s hope they make them Tandberg compatible. I have 7 units I use in a mental health agency for a variety of purposes,” a user by the name of umi Rumford said on Cisco’s umi chat forum, referring to Norwegian video-conferencing company Tandberg, a business acquired by Cisco in 2010. “The new year is only four days old, and already another consumer product from Cisco Systems has been put out to pasture: This time, it’s the consumer videoconferencing product umi,” that person also said. Cisco had launched the $599 umi home videoconference system in October 2010 as a high-quality rival to Skype and other low-cost providers, hoping to expand in the consumer market. Marthin De Beer, head of Cisco’s emerging technologies business group, said at the time umi’s quality made it different from others. “It is different, it’s a new class of product and you will see that the experience is transformational,” he said at the time of the launch. Cisco declined to give sales figures for the umi system. Videoconference start-up Vidyo, which unveiled a new technology in November that allowed its service to run using virtual servers, said the Cisco decision confirmed the trend in the industry away from hardware and toward software. “The only way to introduce new services is through solutions that work on devices people already own such as smart phones and tablets,” Vidyo Chief Executive Ofer Shapiro said. Rival Skype pointed to a blog on its site written at the launch of umi and said the blog was still valid. Skype said at the time that a $599 device could be “subject to obsoletism at the hands of mass-market options.” (Reporting By Nicola Leske in New York, additional reporting by Tarmo Virki in Helsinki; Editing by Steve Orlofsky) ",1042012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cisco-homevideo/cisco-shelves-home-telepresence-amid-company-revamp-idUSTRE80329C20120104
124,CSCO,Cisco seen reporting solid second quarter,"(Reuters) - A year after network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc unnerved investors with yet another weak quarterly outlook the company looks set to report a stable quarter buoyed in part by improving enterprise demand in the United States. Analysts on average expect Cisco to post earnings of 43 cents a share excluding items, up 16.2 percent, in the quarter that runs until end-January, on a revenue increase of almost 8 percent to $11.23 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For the current quarter analysts estimate earnings of 45 cents a share on revenue of $11.48 billion. Cisco is due to report its second quarter results after the bell on Wednesday, February 8. “We believe improving demand in the U.S. is driving a recovery in Cisco’s business with solid growth across U.S. enterprise and commercial offsetting weakness in Europe and parts of Asia such as India,” Natarajan Subrahmanyan, analyst at The Juda Group, wrote in a note. He added that “Cisco will outgrow its peers over the long-term, given enterprise networking is outgrowing overall IT spending.” Investors have been trying to gauge what IT budgets will look like in 2012, with mixed messages from companies in the past two months, and will be keen to hear Cisco’s take on the macroeconomic outlook. Some of Cisco’s smaller rivals such as Juniper Networks, Tellabs and Acme Paket had warned of weak capex spending while F5Network said it sees a boost in enterprise demand, thanks to a boom in data center consolidation. Cisco, which is active in data centers as well, appeared to have also seen solid enterprise demand that “tempered downbeat carrier capex,” Barclays said. According to Morgan Stanley analyst Ehud Gelblum, Cisco had also benefited from revenue from large routing contracts in China. In addition, Subrahmanyan said Cisco had been aggressive in pricing in the routing market, possibly resulting in some moderate gains in market share. Routers and switches, which direct Internet traffic, are core to Cisco’s business but the company has also focused on data centers, enabling and providing cloud computing technology and video platforms. “We expect Cisco to report relatively in-line results and guidance, causing it to remain the safe haven it has become since late last summer,” Gelblum said, but cautioned that some issues remained. While he expected Cisco to gradually lose share in the fixed line switching market where both Juniper and Hewlett-Packard Co remained aggressive, he anticipated that “Cisco can lose share gracefully and not miss numbers.” Cisco would likely lose some market share to Juniper in the data center market as well, Gelblum said.

The company, a sector bellwether because of its global scale and diverse client base, forecast 5 to 7 percent growth in fiscal third-quarter revenue. That translates into a sales outlook of $11.4 billion to $11.6 billion, matching or slightly exceeding Wall Street’s average forecast of $11.46 billion. Executives also forecast gross margins of 61.5 to 62 percent in the fiscal third quarter ending April. “Broadly speaking, people expected a good quarter. This is probably a little better than expected and the dividend is an added surprise,” said Mizuho Securities analyst Joanna Makris. Revenue rose 10.6 percent from the year-ago quarter to $11.5 billion. Analysts on average were expecting $11.23 billion. Net income grew to $2.2 billion, or 40 cents per share, from $1.5 billion, or 27 cents share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings were 47 cents per share, beating the average estimate of 43 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Cisco said on Wednesday it plans to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per common share, up 2 cents from the previous quarter. “Our operational focus continues to yield positive results - we hit our billion dollar expense reduction a quarter early,” Chief Executive John Chambers said in a statement on Wednesday. Cisco last year scaled back on consumer businesses and laid off thousands in a sweeping 4-month overhaul, aiming to cut expenses by $1 billion. Cisco’s core business is routers and switches, which direct Internet traffic, but the company has also focused on data centers, enabling and providing cloud computing technology and video platforms.

128,CSCO,Optimism springs eternal in Cisco shares ahead of results,"NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Cisco’s earnings have had a way of crushing the dreams of optimists in the last two years. Shares of the computer networking giant have often rallied ahead of its earnings report, sparking bullish sentiment among options players, only to fall sharply after the company fails to meet lofty expectations. There are fears this will happen again when the company reports results after the close of trading on Wednesday. The stock has been on a roll, rising more than 50 percent from a 52-week low to levels not seen in a year. “There is a lot of optimism from option traders heading into earnings,” said Joe Bell, senior equity analyst at Schaeffer’s Investor Research in Cincinnati. “If the results do not meet expectations, there may be a lot of downside.” The day after five of the last six earnings reports, Cisco Systems Inc shares have been hit hard. The stock fell 10 percent on August 12, 2010, 16 percent on November 11, 2010 and 14 percent on February 10, 2011, according to Reuters data. The one exception in the last six quarters was in August 2011, when the shares gained 16 percent the day after results. Wall Street expects Cisco to report a stable quarter, buoyed in part by improving enterprise demand in the United States. Cisco has outperformed its peers this year, rallying 11.7 percent, and options activity has been tilted to the bullish side. Heading into Wednesday’s earnings report, investors bought 3.61 calls for every put on three U.S. options exchanges as new positions over the past 10 trading sessions, according to Schaeffer’s data. That gauge clocked in higher than 79 percent of the readings taken during the past year. Sentiment in Cisco is among the most optimistic in the S&P; 1500 index, “so even a slight disappointment in earnings could whack the stock,” said Jason Goepfert, president of SentimenTrader.com in Minneapolis. Goepfert’s sentiment score for Cisco is at 84 percent. He views 80 percent as extremely optimistic and under 20 percent as extremely pessimistic. The score is derived by averaging seven measures of sentiment in each stock, which includes the put-and-call open interest and put-and-call volume over the past week. Other tech giants, such as Microsoft Corp and Apple Inc, have hit 52-week highs as market sentiment has improved. Goldman Sachs Group’s derivative strategists recommended that investors consider Cisco calls “to benefit from strong underlying fundamentals this quarter,” they said in a report on Wednesday. But a closer look at the options market suggests some worry. The put skew - a measure of the relative cost of bearish put options versus bullish call options - is elevated. That suggests that even though call activity is dominating, investors are spending more money to protect against a possible negative surprise. Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s, said there is “definitely a big skew currently, as puts are more expensive than calls by the widest margin since August 2011. There’s no doubt investors are paying up for puts in front of this earnings report, but what is interesting is we’ve also seen a good deal of call buying relative to put buying over the previous two weeks.” Expectations are for a post-earnings move of about 6 percent for Cisco shares, up or down, based on Tuesday’s activity of weekly options that expire on Friday. This is below the average 10 percent move for the past four quarters. Cisco shares were flat at $20.20 in morning trading on Wednesday. Option volume was double the average daily turnover on Tuesday, with about 152,000 calls and 60,000 puts traded, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.

131,CSCO,Cisco slips as fragile recovery fails to impress,"(Reuters) - Shares of Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) fell 3 percent, a day after the network equipment maker’s estimate-beating forecast failed to impress, suggesting investors may still be wary of its restructuring efforts paying off so early. The stock has seen a dramatic rise after it hit a nearly two-and-a-half-year low on Aug 9. Shares of the company, which competes with IBM (IBM.N) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) and with smaller firms like Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR.N), have surged 54 percent since then, excluding today’s losses. The market also shrugged off a hike in dividend, as comments on a possible pick-up in M&A; activity hit a sour note with investors unsure of Cisco’s recovery and competitive position. “The specter of potential M&A; adds an additional element of risk to the shares,” BMO Capital Markets said in a note, adding that overall growth still seemed unimpressive. Cisco’s comments about a weak southern Europe and an uncertain public sector business in India may also be worrying. The company, once a Wall Street darling, had been struggling with a business that had grown too big and unwieldy over the years, and issued bleak outlooks and profit warnings through several quarters. But Chief John Chambers, who led the company for 17 years, finally scaled back on consumer businesses and laid off thousands in a sweeping overhaul, aiming to cut expenses by $1 billion. “There were some pockets of concern, notably product GM, Europe, public sector and carrier spending. While none of these concerns are new, they continue to linger,” BMO Capital said. Shares of the company fell to $20.09 in heavy morning trading on the Nasdaq.

135,CSCO,More mobile devices than people by 2016: Cisco,"(Reuters) - Between 2011 and 2016 the amount of mobile data traffic will grow at a compound annual rate of 78 percent as the number of mobile devices connected to the Internet exceeds the number of people on Earth in four years’ time, according to a study by Cisco Systems Inc. The United Nations projects that world population will reach 7.3 billion by 2016. By that time, according to Cisco’s annual visual networking index forecast published on Tuesday, there will be more than 10 billion devices, generating global mobile data traffic of 10.8 exabytes per month. That translates into around 130 exabytes of mobile data per year which is equivalent to 33 billion DVDs or 813 quadrillion text messages, according to Cisco, whose core business is the routers and switches that manage Internet traffic. Most of the devices driving mobile data traffic will be smartphones, laptops and other portable gadgets. But machine-to-machine connections are gaining momentum and by 2016 are expected to reach 2 billion, Cisco said. Machine-to-machine connections (M2M) include GPS systems in cars, tracking systems in fleets and ships or meters to record energy consumption. Mobile data, especially video, puts a strain on wireless networks and while service providers are increasingly offloading mobile traffic to their fixed-line networks, the wireless industry has repeatedly said it needs additional spectrum to keep up with demand. Mary Brown, director of government affairs for Cisco, said she hopes the new data on mobile traffic acts as a reminder to the U.S. Congress that the Federal Communications Commission needs the authority to hold incentive auctions. An incentive auction is a process used by the FCC to compensate existing spectrum licensees for returning their licenses to make spectrum available for new uses like mobile broadband. The goal is to give broadcasters a financial incentive to return unused spectrum licenses so that the regulator can then auction off the spectrum to companies offering mobile data services. “We are going to start to see quality-of-service issues arising in major metropolitan areas if we don’t act to add more spectrum to these mobile networks,” Brown told Reuters. A 20-member panel of lawmakers, tasked with crafting a year-long extension to payroll tax cuts by the end of February, is mulling legislative language giving the FCC incentive auction authority. A portion of auction proceeds could be used as a source of revenue to help pay for tax cuts, and analysts and industry sources say inclusion in the payroll tax extenders bill is likely the best shot to pass spectrum legislation this year.

137,CSCO,Cisco appeals EU's approval of Microsoft/Skype deal,"(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc has challenged EU clearance of Microsoft Corp’s acquisition of Internet voice and video service Skype at Europe’s second highest court, saying the commission should have put tougher conditions on the deal. “Cisco does not oppose the merger, but believes the European Commission should have placed conditions that would ensure greater standards-based interoperability, to avoid any one company from being able to seek to control the future of video communications,” Cisco said on Wednesday. Cisco launched its appeal in the EU’s General Court in concert with Italian fixed-line and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) telephone provider Messagenet SpA, a Skype rival. Microsoft said it was confident the decision would stand up on appeal. “The European Commission conducted a thorough investigation of the acquisition, in which Cisco actively participated, and approved the deal in a 36-page decision without any conditions,” a spokesman said. The Luxembourg-based General Court generally backs the Commission in antitrust cases, but it has on occasion overturned decisions. Nevertheless, challenging the Commission’s decisions in EU courts is risky, with the last successful appeal dating back to 2002. “It is a huge uphill battle; there has only been one successful appeal by a third party against a merger cleared by the EU Commission, but if the companies can raise good arguments, it may stand a chance,” said an antitrust lawyer who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the case. The court, known then as the Court of First Instance, annulled in 2006 the Commission’s clearance of the 2004 merger between the Sony Music and BMG record labels after a challenge by Impala, an independent group of music producers. However, Europe’s highest court subsequently overturned the ruling. Cisco said it has asked for the court to speed up the process, which would still run to about a year. Cisco, whose core business is routers and switches that manage the Internet, is betting on future growth in video, which Chief Executive John Chambers has said will be the future of communication. Cisco argued that Microsoft’s plan to integrate Skype exclusively into its Lync Enterprise Communications Platform could lock-in businesses that want to reach Skype’s 700 million account holders to a Microsoft-only platform. “Imagine how difficult collaboration would be if you were limited to calling people who only use the same carrier or if your phone could only call certain brands and not others,” Cisco said. According to Cisco, interoperability between devices and systems is key to speeding up innovation, creating economic value and increasing choice for users. The video communications market is also very lucrative, with double-digit growth expected to continue through 2015, according to Infonetics research. Microsoft gained EU approval in October last year to buy Skype for $8.5 billion in its largest-ever acquisition. Investors initially questioned the wisdom of Microsoft’s acquisition, especially its high price tag, but have been warming up to the decision, thinking Microsoft would be making a smart move buying advanced communications technology it could put into its products, along with acquiring a ready base of users. Skype, which appointed ex-Cisco manager Tony Bates as its chief executive officer in 2010, popularized the VoIP method of using a computer as a telephone. It is the clear leader in the market, with 145 million users who sign in at least once a month. The European Commission has said it did not see any competition concerns arising from the deal because there were numerous players in the market, including Google Inc. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission cleared the deal in June. ",2152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cisco/cisco-appeals-eus-approval-of-microsoft-skype-deal-idUSTRE81E1P820120215

Nevertheless, challenging the Commission’s decisions in EU courts is risky, with the last successful appeal dating back to 2002. “It is a huge uphill battle; there has only been one successful appeal by a third party against a merger cleared by the EU Commission, but if the companies can raise good arguments, it may stand a chance,” said an antitrust lawyer who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the case. The court, known then as the Court of First Instance, annulled in 2006 the Commission’s clearance of the 2004 merger between the Sony Music and BMG record labels after a challenge by Impala, an independent group of music producers. However, Europe’s highest court subsequently overturned the ruling. Cisco said it has asked for the court to speed up the process, which would still run to about a year. Cisco, whose core business is routers and switches that manage the Internet, is betting on future growth in video, which Chief Executive John Chambers has said will be the future of communication. Cisco argued that Microsoft’s plan to integrate Skype exclusively into its Lync Enterprise Communications Platform could lock-in businesses that want to reach Skype’s 700 million account holders to a Microsoft-only platform. “Imagine how difficult collaboration would be if you were limited to calling people who only use the same carrier or if your phone could only call certain brands and not others,” Cisco said. According to Cisco, interoperability between devices and systems is key to speeding up innovation, creating economic value and increasing choice for users. The video communications market is also very lucrative, with  double-digit growth expected to continue through 2015, according to Infonetics research. Microsoft gained EU approval in October last year to buy Skype for $8.5 billion in its largest-ever acquisition. Investors initially questioned the wisdom of Microsoft’s acquisition, especially its high price tag, but have been warming up to the decision, thinking Microsoft would be making a smart move buying advanced communications technology it could put into its products, along with acquiring a ready base of users. Skype, which appointed ex-Cisco manager Tony Bates as its chief executive officer in 2010, popularized the VoIP method of using a computer as a telephone. It is the clear leader in the market, with 145 million users who sign in at least once a month. The European Commission has said it did not see any competition concerns arising from the deal because there were numerous players in the market, including Google Inc. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission cleared the deal in June. ",2152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/cisco/update-3-cisco-appeals-eus-okay-of-microsoft-skype-deal-idUSL2E8DFCQ720120215

140,CSCO,FEATURE-The battle's on for control of the video dial tone,"NEW YORK, Feb 29 (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc’s  attempt to convince a European court to impose tougher conditions on Microsoft Corp’s acquisition of Skype signals that technology companies are gearing up to battle for control of what some say is the next big thing: videoconferencing. As the networking giant scrambles to safeguard its market leadership and ownership of a technology that is crossing over from business into the consumer world, rival players like Polycom Inc and Citrix Systems Inc are devising their own user-friendly solutions. All will contend with Microsoft, which analysts say plans to integrate Skype into its products, potentially boosting the allure of its software and a future crop of Windows devices. The teleconferencing market is small, but its growing popularity among consumers and its widening use in mobile phones make this struggle — waged through courts, mergers and regulators — a crucial one. “Video is the new world ..., and you will see lots of acquisitions, lots of lawsuits, and those who are behind will use patent litigation,” said Krish Ramakrishnan, chief executive officer of videoconferencing service Blue Jeans Network. Research firm Infonetics forecast that video would be the top trend in telecoms. The global enterprise videoconferencing market will hit $5 billion in 2015 compared with $2.2 billion in 2010. Videoconferencing is on the brink of widespread adoption. New services and software are enabling a high-speed Internet connection and standard desktop computer, smartphone or tablet to provide quality similar to the expensive systems that were once confined to corporate boardrooms. In fact, free chat services such as Apple Inc’s  FaceTime, Skype and Google+ are slowly making video a part of everyday life for many users outside of the workplace. But one thing holding back its growth is that the technology is often proprietary. That makes many services incompatible with each other, so callers on Skype cannot hook up with people using Polycom, the No. 2 videoconferencing player, for example. Text messaging did not become ubiquitous — and create dependable revenue streams for operators — in the United States until the middle of the last decade, after mobile providers agreed to work together and allow people to send messages regardless of their carrier. On the surface, that’s Cisco’s main gripe with the Microsoft-Skype deal, which closed in October. Cisco argues that the deal will impede interoperability and that Microsoft will be able to lock in businesses that want to reach Skype’s 700 million account holders if it integrates the acquired technology exclusively into its Lync Communications Platform. Cisco Chief Executive Officer John Chambers said that when the company acquired Norway’s Tandberg in 2009, the EU approved the deal under the condition it stick to open standards. Now it wants to ensure Microsoft does the same. Most analysts and industry experts say Cisco fears it could lose its dominant position if Microsoft does a good job of absorbing Skype, which already allows a combination of business and consumer usage. Many companies, including computer consultancy Capgemini, already use Skype as an unofficial video tool, and millions of consumers worldwide take advantage of it. But industry observers also argue that given Microsoft’s less-than-stellar track record on innovation, Cisco can afford to sit back and relax. “I am surprised they are still pursuing regulatory relief and using interoperability as a fig leaf for it,” Ovum analyst Ian Jacobs said. “Cisco needs to let Microsoft do what it does best and stifle innovation of its own products.” Ex-Microsoft President Dick Brass once described how the company had developed a tablet PC as early as 2001, but it was doomed because of internal opposition. “Buying Skype was one of Microsoft’s most brilliant moves in a long time,” said Joseph Coyle, Capgemini’s North American head of technology. “They’ll pose a big challenge to Cisco unless they stumble.” Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said at the Goldman Sachs technology conference earlier this month that the company’s Lync platform appealed to enterprise, or business, customers, but can’t be used with someone outside a company’s firewall or with an incompatible system. Enter Skype. Klein said the company had been looking at ways to extend Skype through all of its offerings, from Lync to its Xbox videogame console. Whether Microsoft will prevail remains to be seen, but if industry experts are correct, videoconferencing companies will make more moves to elbow competitors out of the way. “Everyone is trying to create an island...and this (Cisco appeal) is more about slowing down the inevitable,” Ramakrishnan said, adding it was only a matter of time until the intersection between enterprise and consumer video forced vendors to work together. Microsoft itself recently filed a complaint with the European Commission against Motorola Mobility, which it said was trying to block its products that play video and connect wirelessly by charging too much for patents. Ovum’s Jacobs predicted more legal wrangles. “If the slow-moving service providers and technology companies cannot keep up with where the world will be in a year,” Jacobs said, “they will try to hold the world back so it will be where they are in a year.” But such “legal wrangling” will leave room for smaller companies offering videoconferencing for businesses, he added. Jacobs said he also expected some acquisitions as rivals jostle to fill niche areas in their video portfolios. Cisco has a vested interest in keeping rivals at bay. Its Tandberg purchase, which filled a crucial gap between its high-end TelePresence conferencing products and WebEx desktop video service, made the company the dominant player in the market. And it has the added benefit that video requires ample bandwidth as well as advanced network equipment, resulting in sales of routers and switches — the keys to managing Internet traffic and also Cisco’s bread and butter business. Now, Cisco is keen to find new networking functions and is betting heavily on video, which CEO Chambers predicted “will not only be the leading way we communicate, it’ll be the primary form of IT.” However, Cisco likes to be the one-stop shop for all of its customers’ needs, and it repeatedly touts the benefits of a single vendor strategy. It remains to be seen how Cisco will grapple with the new technologies and slew of rivals gearing up to take their slice of the video communications pie. It is still strong in the enterprise segment, but times are changing, analysts say. “We’ve been long-time WebEx users,” said Donald Tom, associate vice president of IT services at TCS Education System. But he noted that its three affiliated colleges and graduate schools recently switched to Citrix’s GoToMeeting HD Faces for video communications among their more than 5,000 students. “We found it easy to use,” he said. “The video is rock-solid. It really can change how we teach and learn.” Capgemini’s Coyle said the company had once had a lot of Cisco gear. “But we’re backing off,” he said. “Their biggest challenge will be around price point.” Bernardo de Albergaria, who heads Citrix’s online collaboration business, said users were looking for simpler solutions because the high cost of infrastructure and maintaining it. “Bring a laptop and a webcam, and you’re set,” he said. “Why do I need to buy a very complex solution now that there’s easy-to-use other stuff?” Others like Polycom choose to make their technology compatible with those of their competitors. Jim Kruger, Polycom’s senior vice president of solution marketing, described Cisco as “one vendor trying to do all, rip and replace everything and then take Cisco.” But like Cisco, Polycom is under pressure from companies such as Citrix and Vidyo, whose videoconferencing systems run on virtual servers, making dedicated gear and services unnecessary. In addition, young people moving into the workplace expect to bring their own mobile devices and have them work smoothly, with instant video and data access. “It is simply a matter of what the coexistence of multiple systems will look like, and who will dictate the terms of that coexistence,” Ovum’s Jacobs said. Cisco will fight hard to make sure it dictates those terms. “They have added a lot of management muscle (to video),” Mizuho Securities analyst Joanna Makris said. “They definitely do not want to lose this case.”",2292012,http://www.reuters.com/article/cisco-video/feature-the-battles-on-for-control-of-the-video-dial-tone-idUSL2E8DT1RS20120229
141,CSCO,"Arista Networks fends off buyers, looks at IPO","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Arista Networks, a company formed by Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) veterans that makes fast network switches used in high-frequency trading, has rebuffed takeover overtures from larger rivals and is instead having internal discussions to go public, possibly as soon as this year or early next. “We are profitable,” Chief Executive Officer Jayshree Ullal told Reuters, “and what we are doing is taking that cash and investing it back into the business and R&D; and sales and marketing.” The fast-growing company is considered one of the top-tier takeover targets in Silicon Valley, although it is not under pressure to sell because the founders are also the financial backers, sources close to the matter said. Ullal, who joined Arista in 2008 after more than 15 years in a number of senior roles at Cisco, said going public would help increase awareness of the company’s brand. Like Facebook Inc FB.N, she said, Arista’s shareholders will eventually exceed 500, the number a private company can have before it must start disclosing financial information to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Arista introduced its first networking products in 2008 and has doubled its revenue every year since, Ullal said. The Santa Clara, California, company counts Andy Bechtolsheim, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems and one of the first major investors in Google Inc (GOOG.O), among its venture capitalist founders. Arista is one of the first companies to build software around silicon from a third party such as Broadcom Corp BRCM.O. The result is a high-speed network switch that has found applications in high-frequency trading at exchanges such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Rivals Cisco and Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR.N) are following Arista into that sector. Last year Cisco launched its Nexus 3000 series, which was especially designed for the high-frequency trading market, and will release Jawbreaker, its next-generation switch later this year. Juniper also released a comparable application called QFX 3500. “Arista’s strategy makes a lot of sense,” said Morningstar Inc analyst Grady Burkett. “They don’t have to spend a lot of money on hardware development. They are attacking one very specific segment of the market. And they build software from the ground up.” Arista joins many other Silicon Valley companies looking at going public on the heels of Facebook’s $5 billion filing earlier this year. They include security software maker Palo Alto Networks, technology management software maker ServiceNow and human resources software provider Workday, sources familiar with the situation said previously. But unlike some of these other companies, Ullal said, Arista still has some work to do — including finding a chief financial officer — before it can go public. Arista will also look to expand its five-member board in the second half of 2012 or early 2013, around the timeframe for an IPO, she said. Bechtolsheim and David Cheriton, a computer science professor at Stanford, invested $100 million to start Arista in 2004. Bechtolsheim is the chairman of Arista, and Cheriton is its chief scientist, the person behind its Linux-based network operating system. Both Cheriton and Bechtolsheim spent several years at Cisco after the giant networking company acquired their companies in the 1990s. Chief Technology Officer Kenneth Duda spent almost three years as a software engineer at Cisco, and Arista recently hired a 15-year Cisco veteran, Christophe Metivier, as vice president of manufacturing. Ullal also appointed Dan Scheinman, who spent 18 years at Cisco, to Arista’s board in November. “Dan, like many members in the company, has a lot of Cisco DNA and remembers what it was like to scale the company and prepare the company for explosive growth in the 1990s,” Ullal said.

142,CSCO,SalesCrunch makes $1 bid for Cisco's WebEx,"(Reuters) - SalesCrunch, an Internet meeting platform, said it made an unsolicited bid to buy Cisco Systems Inc’s (CSCO.O) WebEx online videoconferencing unit for $1 plus a 15 percent stake in itself, a move interpreted by Cisco as a publicity stunt. SalesCrunch Chief Executive Officer Sean Black said on Tuesday that WebEx was not part of Cisco’s core business and that an integration with his company would allow for better features and pricing. “This is a cute publicity stunt from SalesCrunch, and we appreciate that they like our technology, but we have no intention of selling WebEx,” a Cisco spokesman said. Cisco bought WebEx in 2007 for $2.9 billion in its efforts to expand beyond its core business of routers and switches that direct Internet traffic. WebEx is part of Cisco’s package of communications products, in which video plays a major role. But Black said analysts had forecast further asset sales as Cisco moves to focus on its core market and that WebEx was likely to be next. Cisco decided to shut down its Flip video camera division last year rather than sell it as part of a major company reorganization. It had bought the video camera operation for $590 million in 2009 in an acquisition spree to build a stronger consumer business. “Although WebEx doesn’t fit into Cisco’s core business, it doesn’t have to suffer the same fate as Flip,” Black said in a statement. Early this year, Cisco also shut down its Umi home videoconferencing system, a service which it once touted as a quality alternative to popular video chat service Skype. “As part of an acquisition, SalesCrunch proposes to migrate the entire WebEx user base to its next-generation platform over the course of 12 months,” SalesCrunch said.

145,CSCO,Cisco pumps up video offering with $5 billion NDS buy,"(Reuters) - Cisco Systems made its first major acquisition in over two years with a deal to buy NDS, which develops pay TV software, for $5 billion, aiming to boost its presence in the video communications market. In its biggest acquisition since it bought Norway’s videoconferencing company Tandberg for $3.3 billion in 2009, Cisco said NDS was a strategic fit for its video system Videoscape, as NDS’ software allows cable and satellite TV companies to deliver encrypted content through televisions and other devices. Chief Executive John Chambers said Cisco first began looking at NDS about a year ago because of what customers were saying about the company. NDS technology is used by BSkyB and Sky Italia in Europe as well as customers such as Cablevision Systems Corp, Comcast Corp and Rogers Communications Inc in North America. NDS, which filed for a public listing in December, is 51 percent owned by private equity fund Permira and 49 percent by News Corp. Cisco, whose bread-and-butter business is routers and switches that manage Internet traffic, is keen to find new networking functions. The company is betting heavily on video, which Chambers likes to call “the new voice” and is one of its five growth pillars. “This is the right deal to do right now,” Chambers said on a call with analysts, as the way television programming and video are being consumed is changing. “It (video) will be pervasive, on every device,” he said. He said NDS’ flagship product, VideoGuard, which is installed on home TVs via smartcards integrated into set-top boxes, complements Cisco’s video offerings because it allows television operators to extend their pay-TV services to other media devices while ensuring that content cannot be hacked by non-paying customers. Chambers said there were more opportunities for acquisitions, but said any future buys would likely be smaller. Cisco said it would pay about $5 billion, including the assumption of debt and retention-based incentives, to acquire all of NDS, which Chambers said has less than $1 billion in total liabilities. Cisco’s other recent large acquisitions include online video platform WebEx for $2.9 billion in 2007 and digital cable set-top box unit Scientific Atlanta for $6.9 billion in 2005. The boards of Cisco and NDS have approved the acquisition, which is expected to close during the second half of 2012. The purchase price is about 35 percent higher than the value of NDS when it was delisted from Nasdaq in 2009. “While we view the price as rich for a company growing sales less than 10 percent year on year, we believe it addresses a large opportunity in enabling service providers to offer comprehensive digital media and integrated video offerings,” ISI analyst Brian Marshall said in a note. Cisco said the deal would add to earnings per share in the first year but Marshall said it was not clear how that would happen other than through job cuts. Chambers said he based his assumption on NDS’ double-digit growth and recurring revenue stream. The NDS acquisition is the largest in Israel after the $4.8 billion purchase of Chromatis by Lucent in 2000. Deals to acquire or merge Israeli and Israel-related tech companies were valued at $5.1 billion in all of 2011 — the second-highest amount in a decade — according to the Israel Venture Capital Research Center. News Corp acquired NDS in 1992 for $15 million. NDS went public in 1999 but was bought back a decade later by Permira and News Corp and turned into a private company. Analysts said it made sense for News Corp to sell its stake. “NDS Group is a non-strategic asset,” Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger said, adding that News Corp President and COO Chase Carey has said that the company should either monetize or add to the company’s equity stakes. “As a non-strategic equity investment, it makes sense to sell the equity stake in NDS completely’” Juenger said. “NDS’ customer portfolio will broaden Cisco’s presence into new segments of the service provider market,” Marthin de Beer, Cisco’s senior vice president of video, said in a company blog. “It will expand Cisco’s reach into emerging markets where NDS has a strong footprint with customers such as CCTV in China and Bharti and TataSky in India,” he added.

148,CSCO,Cisco to buy NDS for $5 bln -Israeli report,"TEL AVIV, March 15 (Reuters) - NDS, which develops software for multi-channel television networks, is in advanced talks to be acquired by Cisco Systems for $5 billion, Israel’s Calcalist financial newspaper reported on Thursday. Founded in Israel in 1988 and headquartered in London, NDS is 51 percent owned by the Permira private equity fund and 49 percent by News Corp. It maintains a large research and development centre in Jerusalem. Officials at NDS in Jerusalem could not immediately be reached for comment. The deal’s value is about 35 percent higher than NDS’s value when it was delisted from the stock exchange in 2009, Calcalist said. It is believed that negotiations between the parties set the backdrop for the retirement of chief executive Abe Peled in July. Peled, the Israeli who headed the company for 16 years, was named chairman of the company instead. NDS specialises in the development of interactive systems for secure delivery of entertainment and information to digital TVs, digital set-top boxes, PCs and mobile devices.

150,CSCO,Cisco to secure employees' personal devices,"(Reuters) - Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) is expanding its services to enable companies to manage and secure private mobile devices used by employees at work, aiming to benefit from the trend widely known as BYOD or Bring Your Own Device. While corporate IT departments have systems in place to ensure desktop security and to prevent data loss over the Internet or through emails, they are now facing the challenge of dealing with devices such as smartphones, tablets, USB drives or laptops that can open the door to malware or data loss. That’s where Cisco sees growth opportunities for its services, which it has expanded to enable businesses to provide control over individual access and security, beyond merely connecting outside devices to a company network, the company said on Tuesday. Allowing staff to use any device they choose is becoming a differentiator for companies seeking to hire young employees but it can become a nightmare for the IT department. According to a study by the Ponemon Institute published in February, organizations often do not know if and what kind of data is leaving their networks through non-secure mobile devices. “Fifty-nine percent of respondents report that employees circumvent or disengage security features, such as passwords and key locks, on corporate and personal mobile devices,” the study found. However, only 39 percent have the necessary security controls to address the risk, and only 45 percent have enforceable policies, the study also said. Cisco, which allows staff to use their own devices, said earlier this month that staff using personal devices at the company grew 52 percent in the past year to 50,538 from 33,354 in 2010, with iPhones dominating with around 21,000 devices being used by employees.

153,CSCO,"Cisco outlook underwhelms, economy fears persist","(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) forecast quarterly earnings below Wall Street’s expectations, accentuating concerns about global technology spending and the network equipment maker’s ability to weather persistent economic weakness. Shares in the company, which relies on government and corporate spending on Internet gear, slid more than 8 percent after hours, despite beating analysts’ third-quarter earnings estimates by a penny. The company, which Chief Executive John Chambers a year ago admitted had “lost its way” after several quarters of sub-par growth, forecast revenue growth of 2 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter. That translates into revenue of about $11.4 billion to almost $11.8 billion this quarter, lagging Wall Street’s average forecast of $12 billion. Cisco also estimated earnings of 44 to 46 cents a share, excluding items, in the fiscal fourth quarter ending in July. Wall Street analysts had on average expected 49 cents a share. Chambers acknowledged that it was it was “really hard to read” what would happen in the second half the year but added that customers have said their plans were to spend more in that period. “However, in the very next sentence they said we are waiting to see what happens in Europe and what happens with government policy,” Chambers said, adding that customers had grown more conservative. Recession in the euro zone is forecast to last until the third quarter before modest growth returns, a Reuters survey showed, but the median outlook masks a wide spread of opinion, with bears forecasting contraction out to late 2013. EUGDPQ Analysts warned that technology spending by enterprises and governments remained weak, with European and U.S. economies still on shaky ground. “There is definitely some macro impact. But Cisco is also facing tougher competition from rival HP,” said Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry. “HP hit bottom and they are on their way up. They have become smarter,” he said. “On the other hand, Cisco is suffering from stagnation. They are laying people off. How are you going to innovate and win if you are laying people off? Their remaining employees aren’t motivated to win.” Shares in Cisco, whose rivals include Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and Juniper Networks (JNPR.N), slid to $17.23 in extended trading from a close of $18.78 on Nasdaq. Analysts had counted on a solid quarter driven by U.S. enterprise and commercial demand, as well as gains in the router and switches markets, offsetting weakness in the public sector and Europe. Total third-quarter revenue rose 6.6 percent from the year-ago quarter to $11.59 billion, compared with a Street view of $11.58 billion, the company said on Wednesday. It posted a 5 percent jump in revenue from its core business of network switching in the same quarter. In its Europe, Middle East and Africa region, revenue rose just 4.6 percent, while U.S. revenue was up an even more anemic 3.2 percent from a year earlier. Earnings, excluding items, were 48 cents per share compared with the average estimate of 47 cents a share as compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “It’s not too shabby, considering the choppy environment we are in,” said Mark Sue, analyst at RBC Capital Market. “Still, the global macro storm clouds are gathering and it remains to be seen if Cisco can use its new-found execution prowess to navigate this difficult environment.” ",5092012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ciscosystems/cisco-outlook-underwhelms-economy-fears-persist-idUSBRE8481CZ20120509

156,CSCO,Cisco shares drop on tech spending worries,"(Reuters) - Shares of Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) slid more than 9 percent in early trading after the network equipment maker’s disappointing outlook exacerbated worries about government spending in the United States and Europe. Cisco’s shares — among the top percentage losers on the Nasdaq on Thursday morning — touched a low of $17.02 in their sharpest fall in more than a year. It was also the most traded stock on the exchange. Brokerages including BMO Capital Markets, Deutsche Bank, Nomura Equity Research, UBS and Mizuho Securities cut their price targets on the company’s shares. “Cisco’s results highlight a difficult IT spending environment but pockets of growth should appear in the second half of 2012 with a hopeful resumption of telco spending,” Piper Jaffray analyst Troy Jensen said in a research note. Jensen maintained his “neutral” rating on the stock, citing limited visibility into the company’s growth prospects, but lowered his price target by $1.00 to $20. According to Thomson Reuters StarMine, nine analysts rate Cisco stock a “strong buy,” 15 rate it a “buy,” 19 have a “hold” and only two rate it a “sell.” The mean price target on the stock is $22.58. Cisco said it was difficult to predict second-half performance. “We continue to see the impact of the areas of concern we have discussed for the last few quarters ... Europe and the global economy, India, and conservative IT spend as reflected in the commentary of our peers,” CEO John Chambers said on a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. Shares of rival network equipment maker Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR.N) were down 4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. Technology bellwethers such as IBM Corp (IBM.N), Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Oracle Corp ORCL.O have also made cautious comments about tech spending by governments and businesses. Chambers, Cisco’s legendary helmsman, said a year ago that the company — once a Wall-Street darling — had “lost its way,” as it struggled with a business that had grown too big and unwieldy over the years. On Wednesday, he said the continued pressure on government and business budgets was hurting sales of Cisco’s telepresence products — part of the video business that the company has picked as one of its new pillars of growth. A telepresence system is a suite of applications and products that enhances videoconferencing quality. Shares of videoconferencing rival Polycom Inc PLCM.O slipped nearly 5 percent to $12.06 on the Nasdaq.

Brokerages including BMO, Deutsche, Nomura, Piper Jaffray and Mizuho cut their price target on Cisco’s stock. Cisco reported higher-than-expected third-quarter earnings on Wednesday but said it was “really hard to read” what would happen in the second half of the year as customers were more cautious about Europe. The company, which relies on government and corporate spending on Internet gear, could be in for further estimate cuts if economic trends deteriorate further, said Nomura. Cisco’s comments will likely pressure stocks across the sector, analysts said. “The weak fourth-quarter guide is indicative of near-term macro-driven uncertainty in enterprise IT spending,” said Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Modoff. Cisco’s comments about its telepresence sales, which were hurt by spending cuts by governments as well as businesses, are also negative for videoconferencing company Polycom Inc , BMO Capital Markets analysts said. The tough spending environment will make it even more difficult for Polycom to fix its sales execution issues, said BMO analysts, who cut their price target on Cisco by $2 to $20. Last month, Polycom forecast second-quarter results that were below expectations after the first quarter was hurt by lower government spending.

158,CSCO,"Corrected: Analysis: Cisco spooks, but IT spending seen on mend","(Reuters) - As a cautious outlook from Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) pummels shares of the network equipment maker and its peers, it might be time to go bargain hunting. Even as Cisco warned that technology spending by companies could be hurt by concerns about Europe, analysts say there is room for optimism. Pointing to last year’s experience, some say tech spending may rebound in the second half, potentially boosting equipment makers shares again. Morgan Stanley is advising its clients to start making bets in anticipation of a pickup in tech spending. Morgan Stanley analyst Ehud Gelblum recommends F5 Networks Inc (FFIV.O) and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), in addition to Cisco. “In our sector upgrade last month, we called for this round of earnings to mark the last round of negative earnings revisions before an improvement in 2H,” Gelblum said. Research firm IDC forecast global spending on technology to grow 5.9 percent this year, after climbing 6.4 percent in 2011. “We still think we are not going to lurch into an economic downturn,” said IDC analyst Stephen Minton. That type of optimism kept Cisco’s cautious forecast from causing shares across the broad technology sector to tank, even as the company’s own shares fell more than 10 percent. The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index was flat as IBM (IBM.N) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) were little changed, while Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) rose 0.8 percent. Cisco’s smaller rivals were harder hit, with Juniper Networks (JNPR.N) and Riverbed Technology RVBD.O dropping 4.9 percent and 5.7 percent, respectively. Big software makers and services company sign long-term contracts that generate more predictable revenue streams than those of equipment companies like Cisco - although Cisco has been at pains to drive software revenue models too. Economists expect the Eurozone recession to last through the third quarter, before modest growth returns, a Reuters survey showed, but the median outlook masks a wide spread of opinion, with bears forecasting contraction out to late 2013. EUGDPQ IDC, however, forecast some growth in IT spending in Western Europe, 0.9 percent for the year, with the United States showing growth of 6.5 percent. To be sure, nobody is expecting 2012 to be a banner year for the technology sector, even in the United States, which has yet to suffer from the European flu. “Growth in the U.S. is not great but it is good enough,” Minton said. Paul Otellini, chief executive of No. 1 chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O), also struck a cautious tone on Thursday while answering questions at the company’s annual investor day. “This quarter is playing out as we thought. The enterprise is good, it’s not fantastic,” Otellini said. Intel shares were little changed at $27.24. Shares of EMC Corp EMC.N, the world’s biggest maker of corporate storage gear, were among the day’s worst performers among big technology companies. Like Cisco, EMC sells expensive hardware. In tough economic times, businesses and governments typically react by putting off equipment upgrades, and try to make what they have last longer before looking for deeper cuts. “Enterprises in North America have simply become frozen like deer in the headlights with respect to their networking spend,” Gelblum said in a note to clients. “All of Europe - from governments to enterprises to services providers - have cut back dramatically in their network deployment activity.” Traditionally, equipment makers get hit first as companies try to make infrastructure last longer. Computer makers HP and Dell Inc DELL.O have tried to offset that impact because they also sell software and services. IBM, for example, has focused on software and services, going so far to sell off its PC business, buy consultancy PriceWaterhouseCooper and acquire a string of software makers. For now, Cisco is valued at 9.4 times estimated 12-month forward earnings while Dell and HP are traded at 7.3 and 5.5 times, respectively, according to StarMine, which gives more weight to timelier forecasts and those from the historically most accurate analysts. Barclay analyst Jeff Kvaal added that despite Cisco’s “downbeat tone on IT spending and Europe,” he did not see signs that “support a pronounced market down tick.” Both Kvaal and Gelblum agree that even if the economy does worsen, Cisco may prove to be a safe haven. “We believe the large, integrated, global providers such as Cisco which provide more nuts-and-bolts networking equipment the best investments in our sector,” Gelblum said.

Among 600 IT and business executives questioned by Cisco’s consulting arm 95 percent said they support employees bringing and using personal devices in the workplace in some way, Cisco’s Internet Solutions Business group (ISBG) said on Wednesday. Corporate IT departments have been slow to embrace the trend dubbed ‘Bring your own device’ (BYOD) because of potential security risks.

That is equivalent to 110 exabytes per month by 2016, up from about 31 exabytes per month in 2011, Cisco said.

165,CSCO,Cisco sues TiVo over DVRs,"* Cisco seeks to void four TiVo patents * Cisco says its DVRs do not infringe TiVo patents * Patent litigation is key part of TiVo business strategy By Liana B. Baker and Jonathan Stempel June 1 (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc has filed a lawsuit to void four TiVo Inc patents related to digital video recorders, escalating a battle over who has the right to profit from sales of the popular machines. In a complaint filed on Wednesday, Cisco said TiVo has resisted granting a broad license to its technology because doing so would impede TiVo’s capacity to bring — and ultimately settle — lawsuits over its patents, a key source of revenue. Cisco sells DVRs through its Scientific Atlanta division to companies including AT&T; Inc, Time Warner Cable Inc  and Verizon Communications Inc. “Absent a declaration of invalidity and/or non-infringement, TiVo will continue to wrongfully allege that Cisco DVRs and Cisco’s customers infringe the TiVo patents, and thereby cause Cisco irreparable injury and damage,” Cisco said. Cisco sued in the federal court in its hometown of San Jose, California. It seeks a court order that voids the TiVo patents or declares that Cisco and its DVRs are not infringing them. A TiVo spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. TiVo sells its own set-top boxes and licenses technology to cable TV operators including Charter Communications Inc , DirecTV and Virgin Media Inc. Todd Mitchell, an analyst at Brean Murray who has a “buy” rating on TiVo, said a ruling in Cisco’s favor could be a significant setback for TiVo, given its reliance on patent litigation related to technology for recording television. “What you have is all the big guns aimed at TiVo. It’s a David vs. Goliath situation. Cisco has the ability to throw a lot of stuff at TiVo,” he said. Mitchell said Cisco likely already has a strong patent trove, which would be aided by its planned $5 billion acquisition of NDS Group Ltd, which makes Pay TV software. On Wednesday, TiVo posted a larger-than-expected quarterly loss of $20.8 million as operating costs more than doubled. Revenue rose 48 percent to $67.8 million. Cisco net sales totaled $11.59 billion in the quarter. TiVo is currently involved in patent litigation with Verizon and Google Inc’s Motorola Mobility business. In January, AT&T; agreed to pay TiVo at least $215 million plus monthly licensing fees to settle patent litigation. Dish Network Corp and EchoStar Corp in May 2011 agreed to pay TiVo $500 million to settle a similar case. In morning trading on the Nasdaq, TiVo shares were down 44 cents, or 5.2 percent, at $8.10, while Cisco shares were down 32 cents, or 2 percent, at $16.01. The case is Cisco Systems Inc v.

166,CSCO,Exclusive: Iranian cell-phone carrier obtained banned U.S. tech,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A fast-growing Iranian mobile-phone network managed to obtain sophisticated U.S. computer equipment despite sanctions that prohibit sales of American technology to Iran, interviews and documents show. MTN Irancell, a joint venture between MTN Group Ltd of South Africa and an Iranian government-controlled consortium, sourced equipment from Sun Microsystems Inc, Hewlett Packard Co and Cisco Systems Inc, the documents and interviews show. MTN owns 49% of the joint venture but provided the initial funding. The procurement - through a network of tech companies in Iran and the Middle East - offers further evidence of the limitations of U.S. economic sanctions. The sanctions are intended to curb Iran’s nuclear program, which Tehran maintains is peaceful. No U.S. company can sell goods or services to Iran unless it obtains special authorization, such as for humanitarian aid. But U.S. enforcement has focused on containing Iranian banks, terrorism, Iran’s oil industry, and individuals and companies that Western capitals believe are involved in Tehran’s nuclear development program. Reuters reported in March and April that ZTE Corp, a Chinese telecom-equipment maker, had sold or agreed to ship millions of dollars worth of U.S. hardware and software to Iran since 2010 despite a longtime U.S. sales ban on tech products to Iran. The buyers were Iran’s largest telecom carrier, Telecommunication Co of Iran, and a unit of the consortium that controls it. The U.S. Department of Commerce is investigating. People involved in Iran’s telecommunications industry say U.S. computer components remain widely available in Iran today. “There’s nothing you can get in the U.S. or Dubai that you can’t get in Iran,” Chris Kilowan, who was MTN’s top executive in Iran from 2004 to 2007, said in an interview. He said MTN’s parent company, MTN Group, was directly involved in procuring U.S. parts for MTN Irancell, which launched in 2006 and is now Iran’s second-largest mobile-phone operator. “All the procedures and processes around procurement were established by MTN,” he said. He said the company agreed to allow its Iranian partners and MTN Irancell to set up a local Iranian company with the “basic” purpose of evading sanctions on Iran. In a statement, Paul Norman, MTN Group’s chief corporate affairs officer, said: “To the best of our knowledge, MTN personnel, directly or indirectly, did not acquire or seek to acquire equipment for use in Irancell’s operations in a manner that was intended to avoid or circumvent U.S. sanctions. MTN is committed to compliance with U.S. sanctions, and is working with the U.S. government and its international legal counsel to remain compliant. MTN owns a non-controlling 49% share in Irancell.” Reuters provided MTN with the names of four current MTN Group executives believed to have knowledge of the procurement of U.S. parts by MTN Irancell. MTN declined to make any of them available for interviews. Kilowan is a central figure in a lawsuit, filed in Washington in March, against MTN by a rival telecommunications company, Turkcell. The Turkish telecom carrier has accused MTN of bribing an Iranian official and other alleged wrongdoing “to steal” from it the original license to launch the operation that became MTN Irancell. Kilowan has provided thousands of pages of documents to Turkcell. MTN denies the allegations and has called Kilowan “a disgruntled former employee” who is an unreliable witness. Kilowan’s claims regarding how MTN Irancell obtained U.S. parts for its network are not a subject of the lawsuit. The claims were supported in documents and numerous interviews conducted by Reuters. For example, Reuters reviewed an 89-page MTN Irancell document from 2008 that shows the telecom carrier was specifically interested in acquiring embargoed products. The document spells out the requirements of a managed-services contract it ultimately awarded to Huawei Technologies Co, China’s largest telecom-equipment maker. In a section on managing product-support agreements for third-party equipment, the MTN Irancell document states, “This should include embargo items.” The document also includes lists of network equipment, including Cisco routers, Sun servers and products from HP. Ross Gan, a spokesman for Huawei, said the company observes U.S. export laws and did not provide any equipment to MTN Irancell. “Based on our limited understanding, we are unaware of any embargoed components,” he said. He also said Huawei was “unaware” of the contract document that refers to “embargo items.” In interviews, the U.S. companies said they were not aware MTN Irancell had acquired their equipment. Two companies - Oracle Corp, which owns Sun, and Cisco - said they were investigating the matter. A spokesman for Cisco said: “Cisco complies with all US export laws and requires our business partners to expressly acknowledge that they too must abide by these laws. We have been unable to find any information suggesting that Cisco employees were aware of any sales of Cisco equipment to Iran. We continue to investigate this matter, as any violation of U.S. export controls is a very serious matter.” A spokeswoman for HP said its distribution contract terms prohibit sales into Iran. “Compliance with US and international trade law is a high priority for HP,” she said. Kilowan said MTN Irancell originally obtained Sun servers from an Iranian firm called Patsa Co. He said an official with Patsa approached him and said: “We know you’ll need these servers. We already have them in Iran.” Kilowan said the company delivered at least a half dozen of the servers about two weeks later in early 2006. The official at Patsa didn’t return a call and emails seeking comment. Patsa later won a contract to manage MTN Irancell’s data center, which contains customer information. Kilowan said an Iranian official at the telecom carrier said Patsa could only have the contract if it partnered with MTN’s Iranian partners - Sairan, which is believed to be controlled by Iran’s defense ministry, and Bonyad Mostazafan, which is believed to report directly to Iran’s supreme leader. Kilowan said the three companies then set up an Iranian firm called Arya Hamrah Samaneh Co with MTN’s approval. He said Arya Hamrah was used to “camouflage” purchases of embargoed equipment. Arya Hamrah’s website recently said the company was founded in 2006 and was “a leading technology services company.” According to archive.org, which archives websites, the company in 2007 listed only one customer under “Projects” - MTN Irancell - and stated it was involved in “procurement” for the telecom carrier’s data center. The section of the 2008 MTN Irancell contract document that refers to “embargo items” also states that the telecom carrier had a support contract with “Arya Hamra Systems” and that “it would be prudent for the selected vendor to use the same supplier.” The spokesman for Huawei, which won the contract, said his company “has never worked with Arya Hamrah Samaneh as part of the management service contract with MTN Irancell.” An Iranian familiar with Arya Hamrah said it was a “major partner and major supplier” of MTN Irancell and that it was able to procure equipment from Sun and HP without any problems, via Dubai. He declined to discuss Arya Hamrah’s ownership, saying it was “a secret.” Another person familiar with Arya Hamrah said one of its sources for Sun equipment for MTN Irancell was an Iranian firm called Fakour Co, with which Arya Hamrah sometimes competes. The home page of Fakour’s website, fakour.net, features the logo of Oracle, which owns Sun. The website also includes detailed information about Sun products including Sun marketing material. The site states: “For near twenty years, Fakour Co has been recognized for its innovation and leadership in bringing network computing products especially Sun Microsystems products and services to the country’s market.” A lengthy list of Fakour’s “main customers” for its “Fakour Sun Microsystems services department” includes Irancell, Arya Hamrah and Huawei. The list also includes 10 Iranian banks, Iran’s Ministry of Energy and numerous Iranian oil companies. U.S. trade sanctions specifically target some of the banks and other firms on the list. A manager at Fakour did not respond to a request for comment. Mahmoud Tadjallimehr, a former project manager at MTN Irancell, said in an interview he was present when the telecom carrier obtained more than 10 Cisco routers and numerous switches in 2007 to route communications traffic. Tadjallimehr worked at the time for Nokia Siemens Networks, but said Nokia-Siemens refrained from any involvement in obtaining embargoed equipment. He said a subcontractor called Shabakkat “did all the work to source the products.” Shabakkat is a telecom service provider based in Kuwait. At the time, it had a unit in Iran called Shabakkat Cellular that worked on the MTN Irancell project. Issaad Assoufi, who was country manager in Iran for Shabakkat Cellular, said in an interview that equipment was purchased from a local company in Iran and that his firm was not involved with bringing it into the country. He declined to identify the local company but said it was not Arya Hamrah, which he said his company had declined to do business with. “I don’t have anything to hide,” Assoufi said. “I didn’t do anything illegal.” Asked how the local Iranian company obtained Cisco products, he said: “How they got into the country, this is another story. I don’t have any idea and I don’t want to know.” ",6042012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-mtn-sanctions/exclusive-iranian-cell-phone-carrier-obtained-banned-u-s-tech-idUSBRE8530SO20120604
167,CSCO,TiVo countersues Cisco as DVR patent battle heats up,"(Reuters) - TiVo Inc countersued Cisco Systems Inc in a court over alleged infringement of four patents relating to digital video recorder (DVR) technology, days after Cisco filed a lawsuit against TiVo to void those same patents.

170,CSCO,NDS says Cisco deal on track despite allegations,"TEL AVIV, June 6 (Reuters) - Cisco’s $5 billion acquisition of pay-TV smartcard maker NDS is on track despite the emergence of new allegations since the deal was announced that NDS used illegal means to undermine competitors, NDS’s executive chairman told Reuters. “The due diligence was obviously over when we did the sale and purchase agreement,” Abe Peled said on the sidelines of a cyber security conference in Tel Aviv on Wednesday. Asked whether Cisco had sought variations in terms or indemnities, he answered: “There is no change since we announced the deal.” A BBC Panorama documentary broadcast in March, two weeks after News Corp and private equity firm Permira agreed to sell NDS to Cisco, alleged that NDS had hired a consultant to post the encryption codes of ITV Digital on his website. Widespread piracy after the online publication of the codes contributed to the 2002 collapse of ITV Digital, which was a key rival of Sky TV, the precursor to BSkyB, which is 39 percent owned by News Corp. “We are completely satisfied that there were no issues ever done by any NDS employees,” Peled said. He added that regulatory approval for the sale to Cisco was expected in the fall. NDS was faced with a $3 billion lawsuit in 2002 from Canal Plus, which had supplied the scrambling technology for ITV Digital and accused NDS of extracting the code from the cards and leaking it onto the Internet. Canal Plus dropped the action in 2003 when News Corp bought Italian satellite pay TV company Telepiu from Canal Plus’s then debt-stricken owner Vivendi. U.S. satellite TV provider EchoStar, which had tried to join the Canal Plus suit, then sued NDS in 2003 in a similar case. NDS was cleared of the main charges.",6062012,http://www.reuters.com/article/nds-cisco/nds-says-cisco-deal-on-track-despite-allegations-idUSL5E8H677N20120606

173,CSCO,Cisco gives CTO stronger role in exec shift,"(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc’s chief technology officer Padmasree Warrior is taking on the additional job of chief strategy officer but unlike her predecessor, Ned Hooper, she is not considered a contender to be CEO. Hooper, a 13-year Cisco veteran, oversaw the $3.4 billion deal for Norwegian video conferencing company Tandberg as well as the $5 billion acquisition of the pay-TV smartcard maker NDS, a deal which has not yet closed. Hooper will be leaving to form an independent investment company, Cisco said on Tuesday. He was considered a potential successor to John Chambers who had to announce job cuts and a major reorganization last year after several quarters of sub-par growth. However, Cisco has since reported three straight solid quarters, squelching any speculation about Chief Executive John Chambers stepping down. The polished and eloquent Warrior, who joined Cisco in 2007 after spending 23 years at Motorola, will remain CTO in addition to her new role. “This allows her to focus on what she does well,” Gartner analyst Andrew Butler said. “Like (CEO) Chambers, Warrior is great on stage, she is well regarded within the company and is seen as a steady hand on the wheel,” Butler said but added that she was not seen as a natural to succeed Chambers. However, that may be a blessing. A number of executives who have been touted as potential heirs to Chambers eventually gave up and left the company. Take Don Listwin, the No. 2 at Cisco after Chambers, who in 2000 quit his job after a decade at Cisco to sign on as CEO with Phone.com, a wireless Internet equipment startup. Analysts said at the time that Listwin was not prepared to wait it out for Chambers to leave. William Nuti, a ten-year veteran and head of Cisco’s U.S. business, left in 2002 to turn around Symbol Technologies and in 2005 succeeded Mark Hurd as CEO at NCR. Mike Volpi, another senior executive and key driver of Cisco’s acquisition strategy between 1994 and 2001, was seen as a rising star with CEO potential at Cisco but resigned in 2005. That move seemed to clear the path for Charles Giancarlo to succeed Chambers but Giancarlo abruptly called it quits two years later and moved on to join private equity firm Silver Lake. “Cisco needs an heir to the throne and you sense that this is a company that is looking to who that person could be,” Gartner’s Butler said. “The good news is that there is no rush to find one,” he added. Chambers, who will turn 63 this August, has been at the helm of the network equipment maker since 1995. Cisco also announced that Pankaj Patel will take over Cisco’s engineering organization, a job he used to share with Warrior. The networking equipment maker has been challenged by rivals such as Hewlett-Packard Co and Juniper Networks in recent quarters. The company set a major reorganization last year aimed at making the business leaner and more efficient. That also included a 15 percent cut in its work force. ISI group analyst Brian Marshall said the management changes was a continuation of that plan. “In our view, (Cisco) is continuing to streamline the organization and consolidating responsibility for engineering, technology vision and strategy with two executives rather than three previously,” Marshall said in a note. “While we favor stability in the leadership ranks, we do not believe these changes were motivated by new execution, competitive challenges or strategic shifts,” he added. Cisco’s shares closed down 0.7 percent at $16.82 on Tuesday. ",6262012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cisco/cisco-gives-cto-stronger-role-in-exec-shift-idUSBRE85P15X20120626

176,CSCO,Analysis: Cisco's loss is Palo Alto Networks' gain,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Cisco Systems Inc decided years ago to drop a network-security project known internally as “Apollo,” little did it know it had paved the way for a startup to blossom into a formidable competitor. That company, Palo Alto Networks, is one of the leaders today in the multibillion-dollar market for corporate Internet firewalls. Founded in 2005, Palo Alto Networks debuts next week in an initial public offering that could value the firm at more than $2 billion. Cisco and other deep-pocketed vendors may have misjudged how Internet use would balloon with the takeoff of social media, and with it, the need for sophisticated tools to safeguard private data and monitor suspicious activity, analysts say. Enter self-taught programmer and Palo Alto Networks founder Nir Zuk, whose penchant for pursuing new technologies culminates in 2012’s most anticipated market debut since Facebook Inc’s IPO in May. “We anticipate this will be one of the hottest tech IPOs of the year,” said ISI group analyst Brian Marshall. The company coined the term “next generation firewall” (NGFW) to describe its products, which among other things, lets companies tightly control access to Internet applications for specific users. An employee could connect with Facebook, for example, but not play games. Essentially, NGFW converges multiple security functions such as firewall, intrusion prevention systems and secure Web gateways on a single platform, Lazard Capital Markets said in a note earlier this week. “Overall, customers get for the first time, a view of the applications and data entering and leaving their networks, such as attachments and zip files,” Lazard said. Palo Alto Networks grew in direct proportion to social networking sites like Facebook, web-based tools like Google Inc’s Gmail and the use of Skype for communications. Its technology made it easier to monitor and secure traffic from social networking platforms than with traditional firewalls offered by Cisco, Check Point Software Technologies and Juniper Networks. “Juniper is rarely considered by customers looking for an NGFW,” research outfit Gartner, which refers to Palo Alto as a “disruptive influence,” said in a report. Palo Alto Networks’ success story illustrates how Cisco and Juniper dropped the ball, allowing an upstart to succeed on their turf. Cisco opted to scrap “Apollo” - which a former employee who worked on the project said would have been a “Palo Alto killer” - in favor of other traditional security features. Network security is now considered among its chief weaknesses, Gartner said. Around that time, Juniper executives were turning deaf ears to the entreaties of then-chief security technologist Nir Zuk. Zuk, who taught himself to write computer programs when he was 16, founded Palo Alto Networks after being frustrated by what he called a lack of innovation at Juniper Networks. He wanted to build a new type of firewall at Juniper but quit his job there in 2005 and persuaded venture capital firms Greylock Partners and Sequoia Capital to provide seed capital for his plans instead. The Israeli native has a history of forgoing the comforts of working for an established company. Recruited by his country’s military as a programmer and then by Check Point, Zuk helped develop the first commercial firewalls at the company. However, showing the entrepreneurial spirit and a distaste for corporate life that would influence his later decisions, Zuk left Check Point when it became too bureaucratic and co-founded security firm One Secure. “They (Check Point) were focusing on fixing bugs instead of developing new technologies, and I like to develop new technologies,” Zuk, now Palo Alto Networks’ Chief Technology Officer, told IT World in 2010. Zuk’s company was then acquired by NetScreen, a firewall vendor that was in turn bought by Juniper. With that transaction, innovation withered, according to Zuk. “When you start with a small company, everything is great and you can build a product, but then you get acquired by a bigger company, and it becomes too big, and you can’t do anything any more,” he told IT World. Now, his company leads the enterprise network firewall market, along with former employer Check Point. Zuk has said publicly he delights in “kicking Checkpoint’s butt” and “kicking Juniper’s butt.” Indeed, Zuk’s license plate for a while read CHKPKLR - “Check Point Killer.” That plate now sits in his office. “The product is fundamentally revolutionary,” said security expert, John Kindervag, at Forrester Research. “All of the big (security) vendors are afraid of Palo Alto. They built it from scratch and they did it in four years.” Rivals like Cisco, Check Point or Juniper Networks would beg to differ, arguing they offer similar products. “We will give them credit for exploiting a feature gap but I don’t lie awake at night worrying about them. We’ve nailed that now,” an executive at a larger rival firm said. Firewall and virtual private networks (VPN) are the biggest segments in enterprise security, with 31 percent of the total 2011 market of $18.2 billion, Lazard said, adding that the NGFW segment was growing significantly faster than the overall market growth of 9 percent. According to Gartner the firewall market, including NGFW, was worth $6.3 billion last year, compared with $5.9 billion in 2010 and $5.4 billion in 2009. “Palo Alto Networks is well positioned to gain share in the network security market and its business model lends itself to significant operating leverage as revenues continue to grow rapidly,” Morningstar said in a note. For the nine months ended April, the company reported net income for the first time of $5.3 million on revenue of $179.5 million, against a loss of $6.5 million on revenue of $78.4 million a year earlier. The successful public debut of IT software company ServiceNow on June 29 bodes well for investor interest in Palo Alto Networks’ road show, which kicked off this week. Despite Palo Alto Networks’ lofty valuation, expected to be as much as $2.4 billion, there are concerns, the most pertinent of which is how long it can sustain its technological edge. “PA’s technological uniqueness is unlikely to last for long, although sticky (or loyal) customers will enable the company to generate recurring revenues for a long time,” Morningstar said. A secondary concern relates to a patent lawsuit filed by Juniper that could potentially force Palo Alto Networks to pay damages for past sales and royalties for ongoing sales. In a December 2011 lawsuit, Juniper accused Palo Alto Networks - and in particular, Zuk - of infringing upon six patents, a claim Zuk’s company has said was “without merit.” A hearing is scheduled for November 11, 2013 and a trial date for February 24, 2014, according to SEC filings. “That lawsuit is a shadow hanging over them,” said IT-Harvest’s chief analyst Richard Stiennon.

188,CSCO,S&P; 500 extends rally to day five with slim gain,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Standard & Poor’s 500 extended its rally to a fifth day on Thursday, again eking out a tiny gain as lingering expectations for economic stimulus from central banks lent support to a market lacking new catalysts. While the S&P; 500 has chalked up three-month highs every day this week, the index has climbed only 0.6 percent over the past three sessions - an indication that investors aren’t prepared to make aggressive bets despite better-than-expected jobless claims and U.S. trade data. The Nasdaq outperformed the other two major U.S. stock indexes, led by Cisco Systems Inc after Goldman Sachs added the company to its conviction buy list and Piper Jaffray upgraded it to “overweight.” Cisco rose 3.2 percent to $17.70 and was the Dow’s biggest percentage gainer. Material stocks also advanced after James River Coal Co said the market for power-generating coal was showing signs of a recovery following massive industry-wide cutbacks in production. The stock surged 13 percent to $2.52 while peer company Arch Coal Inc jumped 7.1 percent to $7.42. An S&P; materials index rose 0.5 percent. The three major U.S. stock indexes seesawed throughout the morning, with the S&P; 500 mostly hovering above 1,400 in light trade as investors bet central banks would soon act to support a global recovery that has shown signs of stalling. “It’s almost eerie how flat the market has been. But while there’s a risk of our becoming overbought, I don’t see why we’d see a decline of any magnitude until we hear what central banks will do,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 10.45 points, or 0.08 percent, to 13,165.19 at the close. But the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index inched up 0.58 of a point, or 0.04 percent, to 1,402.80. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 7.39 points, or 0.25 percent, to close at 3,018.64. Markets held on despite a raft of weak Chinese economic data. Annual growth in factory output slowed to its lowest in more than three years in July while annual consumer price inflation hit a 30-month low. “This news is disappointing, but it only emboldens investors that we’ll be rescued by central banks somewhere,” said Luschini, who helps oversee $54 billion in assets. Data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell last week while the U.S. trade deficit in June was the smallest in 1-1/2 years, hopeful signs for the struggling economy. Beauty products maker Elizabeth Arden forecast 2013 profit above estimates on stronger sales and its shares jumped 13 percent to $44.02. Of the 445 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported second-quarter earnings through Thursday morning, 68 percent have reported earnings above analysts’ expectations, in line with the average over the last four quarters.

There is a decent possibility of a QE3 that is slowly and steadily pushing the market higher.” The Dow Jones industrial average was up 5.07 points, or 0.04 percent, at 13,180.71.

192,CSCO,"Cisco's fourth quarter won't sparkle, but will deliver","(Reuters) - Cisco Systems fourth quarter results may not renew the spark in Wall Street’s fading love affair with the network equipment maker, but for those investors looking for a steady and predictable relationship the company is unlikely to disappoint. “The fourth quarter is typically Cisco’s strongest, but it is only expected to be flat quarter-on-quarter,” Tim Long, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note. “That said, Cisco has executed much better of late and is doing a solid job of managing what is within its control.” Analysts on average expect earnings per share of 45 cents and revenue of $11.61 billion when Cisco reports its fiscal fourth quarter on Wednesday. Cisco, founded in 1984, has delivered on its promises ever since it launched a major restructuring program just over a year ago that included job cuts and cost savings aimed at making the company leaner and more efficient. The San-Jose, California based company spooked investors three months ago, however, when Chief Executive John Chambers cautioned that macroeconomic conditions in Europe could hurt technology spending. Some analysts said at the time that tech spending may rebound in the second half of the year as it did last year. Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Modoff said recent signs were showing that enterprise IT spending in the United States was stabilizing and that IT spending among Fortune 100 companies was improving modestly. “We note that large telcos such as Verizon Business and AT&T; are in the process of meaningfully scaling out their Cloud services infrastructures, an attractive near-term growth opportunity for Cisco’s data center equipment sales,” Modoff said. Ehud Gelblum, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said that accelerating demand from service providers primarily in North America in the second half of 2012 would likely offset slower orders in enterprise, Cisco’s exposure to Europe and flat public sector spending. In its fiscal 2013 outlook, Cisco is expected to remain cautious on Europe and federal spending, though that will likely be factored into expectations and the stock valuation, analysts said. Cisco’s shares have gained almost 26 percent over the last 12 months, but is down 2.1 percent year-to date. They closed trading Friday at $17.47. The company’s shares trade at 9.2 times estimated 12-months forward earnings, which is a discount to smaller rival Juniper Networks, whose shares are valued at 20 times, according to equity research firm StarMine, which gives more weight to estimates from analysts with a better track record. Most analysts shrugged off Cisco’s competitive threats from technological developments such as software defined networking (SDN), an area where VMware recently made a major acquisition, in the near-term. “Longer term, while the competitive threat from SDN seems real and could potentially undermine some of Cisco’s core businesses, it is still a long way from being broadly deployed across networks,” BMO’s Long said. VMware said last month it would acquire privately held Nicira Inc for $1.05 billion. Nicira sells software that lets customers create virtual networks that can operate independently of underlying physical networks in what is called software-defined networking. “We believe the common perception that VMW’s acquisition of SDN upstart Nicira signals eventual commoditization of Ethernet switches is grossly misguided,” Gelblum said.

193,CSCO,"Cisco still pessimistic on Europe, raises dividend","(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc offered little hope that dire economic conditions in Europe would come to an end any time soon but pleased investors with a 75 percent dividend hike as the company posted quarterly results that beat estimates. The world’s largest network equipment maker had spooked investors three months ago, when Chief Executive John Chambers cautioned that macroeconomic conditions in Europe could hurt technology spending but now analysts expect Chambers to remain cautious. Chambers said on a call with analysts that Europe would stay challenging over the next several quarters. “That’s probably going to get tougher before it gets better and that might last for a good little while,” Chambers said, adding that public spending in the United States and Europe would remain weak. As a result, Chambers said, “many of our customers continue to anticipate a challenging next 12 months on a global basis and therefore these CEOs will remain conservative both in their IT expenditures but also in their hiring.” Factoring that in, Cisco expects revenue growth, excluding items and its acquisition of TV software developer NDS, to range from 2 to 4 percent while earnings per share are seen up 5 to 0 percent at 45 to 47 cents, in line with analysts’ expectations. The San Jose, California-based company also said its dividend will rise to 14 cents per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and that it plans to return a minimum of 50 percent of free cash flow annually through dividends and share repurchases. Analysts welcomed the dividend hike but some wondered how revenue growth could be improved. “It’s a significant increase and now they’ve got a real yield,” BGC analyst Colin Gillis said about the dividend, adding that he estimated the yield was at 3.2 percent versus 1.8 percent previously. JMP Securities analyst Erik Suppiger said that while investors are happy that the spending cuts are boosting Cisco’s profits, revenue growth is essential to the networking giant’s long-term success. “Ultimately the company needs to generate some acceleration in revenue growth,” Suppiger said. He added that it remains to be seen whether Chambers can get revenue growing again if he continues to cut spending, particularly sales and marketing. Cisco kicked of a major restructuring program last year that included plans to slash about 15 percent of its work force and cut expenses by about $1 billion. Last month it announced it would cut another 1,300 jobs across the company. Cisco’s fourth-quarter results beat estimates, thanks to cost savings and a continuing restructuring program. Quarterly net income, excluding items, was $2.5 billion or 47 cents per share, compared with analysts’ average estimate of 45 cents a share as compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 4 percent from the year-ago quarter to $11.7 billion, compared with a Street view of $11.61 billion. Cisco shares rose 5 percent to $18.23 after closing up 1 percent at $17.35 on Nasdaq.

The Nasdaq outperformed the market after Cisco shares jumped nearly 10 percent and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) shares hit a new closing high of $636.34, while broad gains across most S&P; 500 sectors offset a gloom from Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N). The day’s gain was the first significant move since a 2 percent gain on Aug 3. Since then, the S&P; 500 has been moving mostly higher, but in a slow motion. “I think the biggest plus today is the fact that people realize that we are now really in an upward trend. We faced resistance but for over a week, we moved higher slowly without a significant pullback. That is what’s pulling people in, although volume remains low,” said Frank Gretz, market analyst at Wellington Shields & Co in New York. “Some say we are climbing the ‘wall of worry.’ I think we are climbing the wall of low expectations. Because nobody is expecting anything good, it is easy to move up on any news.” Merkel said ECB chief Mario Draghi’s vow to do all that is necessary to defend the euro is in line with what European leaders have been saying. Some traders took that as a sign Germany may be drawing nearer to backing purchases of sovereign bonds of troubled European nations such as Spain. Facebook Inc (FB.O) fell to a new low of $19.69 as shares hit the market after the expiration of a lockup period, which had prevented sales by some insiders. The stock ended down 6.3 percent at $19.87. Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) rose 9.6 percent to $19.02 after the company said it would hike its dividend 75 percent after surprisingly strong results late Wednesday. The dividend increase countered a gloomy outlook from Cicso on the debt crisis and recession in Europe. But gains were capped as Wal-Mart shed 3.1 percent to $72.15. The world’s largest retailer posted a bigger-than-expected jump in quarterly profit but forecast full-year earnings that could fall short of Wall Street expectations. Thomson Reuters data shows that of the 468 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported earnings through Thursday morning, 68 percent beat analysts’ expectations, about the same rate as over the past four quarters. Earnings were the bigger driver given the economic data was largely in line with forecasts. The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits edged higher last week although the gauge of a longer trend fell close to a four-year low, indicating a slowly healing jobs market.

Investors were heartened by comments from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said ECB President Mario Draghi’s declarations last month to do whatever was necessary to save the euro were “completely in line” with the approach taken by European leaders. Draghi was criticized within Germany in the wake of those comments. Merkel’s remarks raised the prospect the European Central Bank might soon buy the sovereign debt of Spain, Italy and other debt-laden euro zone members whose high borrowing costs could become crippling. Her comments sent 10-year Spanish bond  yields to a one-month low of 6.55 percent. “Anything from the German quarter that expresses some support is very positive for stocks, peripheral debt and other risky assets. That means the ECB would not be thwarted with its efforts,” said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at Prudential Fixed Income in Newark, New Jersey. On the economic front, a small, unexpected rise in U.S. jobless claims and a surprise drop in housing starts renewed expectations the Federal Reserve would engage in a third round of large-scale bond purchases, dubbed QE3, to help the sluggish economy. That initially spurred investor appetite for safe-haven U.S. and German government bonds. A report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve also signaled business contraction in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region in August, though it was milder than in July. The initial rebound in Treasuries and Bunds markets faded with benchmark U.S. yields approaching their 200-day moving average, a bearish market signal. Other markets held in recent ranges as traders await possible action from U.S., European and Chinese central bankers. “We are still pricing in QE3,” said Ellis Phifer, senior market analyst at Raymond James in Memphis, Tennessee. “If the numbers are bad, stimulus will be closer.” Oil prices flirted with their highest levels since early May on worries about possible supply disruption from tension in the Middle East and a sharp drop in U.S. inventories. Gold prices hovered above $1,600 an ounce on hopes of central bank stimulus, but somewhat encouraging U.S. economic data pared expectations any such moves might happen soon. On Wall Street, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index managed to hold above 1,400, close to a four-year high. Analysts said stocks will likely stay around current levels through options expiration on Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 85.33 points, or 0.65 percent, at 13,250.11. The S&P; 500 ended up 9.98 points, or 0.71 percent, at 1,415.51. The Nasdaq Composite Index finished up 31.46 points, or 1.04 percent, at 3,062.39. Among key stock movers, Cisco Systems rose 9.6 percent to $19.02 a share after the world’s largest network equipment maker reported better-than-expected results and raised its dividend. “Cisco shed some light on the future. It shows a bit more optimism,” said Lawrence Creatura, co-portfolio manager of the Federated Clover Small Value Fund in Rochester, New York. Developments at several top U.S. companies, however, kept a lid on gains. Wal-Mart Stores, the world’s No. 1 retailer, said its full-year results may miss Wall Street expectations as growth slows in international markets. Its stock fell 3.1 percent to $72.15. Shares of Facebook, the world’s biggest Internet social network, lost 6 percent as a lockup period that prevented some insider sales came to an end. They last traded at $19.87, slightly more than half the $38 IPO price. Still, the overall U.S. stock market showed resilience, lifting the global MSCI index by 0.76 percent to 325.18, a level last seen on May 4. Top European shares erased early losses, closing up 0.33 percent at 1,104.37. In the currency market, the dollar turned lower against most major currencies after the latest data on U.S. jobless claims and home construction. The dollar index was 0.32 percent lower at 82.38. Merkel’s remarks stemmed the euro’s recent slide against the greenback, boosting it 0.57 percent to $1.2358. The accelerated gains in stocks and the euro came at the expense of bonds. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were down 6/32  in price, yielding 1.838 percent, just shy of a three-month high of 1.862 percent hit earlier, according to Reuters data. The 10-year yield came within a basis point of its 200-day moving average. If the 200-day average were breached, the 10-year yield could test support in the 2 percent area, analysts said.

202,CSCO,"Cisco jumps on dividend hike, props up network gear makers","(Reuters) - Shares of Cisco Systems Inc jumped 9 percent on Thursday as a dividend hike and share buyback plan overshadowed comments that business conditions in Europe would not improve anytime soon for the network equipment maker. Cisco joins a league of technology companies such as Apple Inc, Intel Corp, Dell Inc and Hewlett Packard Co that have been returning more cash to shareholders over the past few quarters. The company’s shares, which have recovered some of their losses after they fell 11 percent on weak third-quarter results in May, rose to $18.93 in early trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday. The stock used to trade above $80 before the dotcom collapse but have traded at over $25 as recently April 2010 before its CEO John Chambers admitted that the company had “lost its way,” as it struggled with a big and unwieldy business. Several brokerages, including Barclays Capital, Citi Investment Research and Raymond James, raised their price targets on the stock. The mean price target on the company’s shares is $21.01, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Shares of rival network equipment maker Juniper Networks Inc rose 3.4 percent to $19.07 on the New York Stock Exchange, while those of other companies in the sector including F5 Networks Inc, Riverbed Technology Inc and Aruba Networks Inc all rose on the Nasdaq. Cisco said on Wednesday it will raise its quarterly dividend by 75 percent to 14 cents per share after reporting fourth-quarter revenue largely in line with analysts’ estimates. It also said it bought back $1.8 billion worth of shares in the quarter. “The 75 percent increase in dividend and commitment to return at least 50 percent of free cash flow in dividend and buybacks was not expected given high offshore cash balance and should be rightly viewed as sign of overall confidence on part of Cisco,” said Citi Investment Research analyst Kevin Dennean. Barclays and BMO Capital Markets both raised their price targets on the stock by $1 to $22. Citi raised its price target by $2 to $21. BMO analyst Tim Long said he expects the buybacks to continue, but at a slower pace than in the fourth quarter. Robert W. Baird & Co analyst Jayson Noland said though the stock will react favorably now, shares will not move up too much anytime soon given the weak economy. Noland, a five star-rated analyst for the accuracy of his earnings estimates on Cisco according to StarMine, raised his price target by $2 to $21. A faltering U.S. recovery and weakness in Europe have hit network equipment makers over the past year as their biggest customers — telecom service providers — cut spending and delayed purchases of new equipment. Cisco seemed to have little hope on Wednesday that the dire economic conditions in Europe would come to an end any time soon but said it expects spending at customer AT&T; Inc to increase in the second half of 2012. Analysts believe the growth in the company’s U.S. business will offset the weakness in Europe over the next several quarters. Revenue from the Americas rose 7 percent in the fourth quarter. “There are clear signs of a turnaround in the U.S. business across verticals, and this more than offset the continued weakness in Europe,” BMO’s Long wrote in a note to clients.

The S&P; 500 was on course to hit a four-month closing high in the first significant market move in over a week. Traders are looking for a convincing break above the index’s 1,400 level where the market stalled after a 2 percent rally on Aug. 3. Merkel said ECB chief Mario Draghi’s vow to do all that is necessary to defend euro is in line with what European leaders have been saying. Some traders took that as sign Germany may be drawing nearer to backing purchases of sovereign bonds of troubled European nations such as Spain. “The decline in Spanish yields off of that has been a big boon to the market,” said Michael James, senior trader at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles. “There certainly doesn’t seem to be that much interest from longs in selling any strength and that is continuing to frustrate the shorts,” he said. “As the market continues working higher we could see another squeeze.” The yield on the Spanish 10-year bond fell to 6.57 percent, hitting it lowest level in month. Cisco Systems Inc rose 8.6 percent after the company said it would hike its dividend 75 percent after surprisingly strong results late Wednesday. The dividend increase countered a gloomy outlook from Cicso on the debt crisis and recession in Europe. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 67.80 points, or 0.52 percent, to 13,232.58.

Gains were capped as Wal-Mart shed 3.2 percent to $72.08. The world’s largest retailer posted a bigger-than-expected jump in quarterly profit but forecast full-year earnings that could fall short of Wall Street expectations. Wal-Mart traditionally marks the end of the U.S. earnings season. Thomson Reuters data shows that of the 468 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported earnings through Thursday morning, 68 percent beat analysts’ expectations, about the same rate as over the past four quarters. Earnings were the bigger driver given the economic data was largely in line with forecasts. The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits edged higher last week although a longer trend fell close to a four-year low, indicating a slowly healing jobs market. But housing starts unexpectedly dropped 1.1 percent last month as the industry continues to have trouble finding its footing despite some recent signs of life in the sector.

206,CSCO,"Analysis: Cisco, EMC partnership turning into rivalry","(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc, the world’s biggest network equipment maker, and EMC Corp, the leading data storage company, are increasingly encroaching on each other’s turfs, in a sign their long partnership may be unraveling. Cisco and EMC have for years collaborated on designing, marketing and cross-selling their products, choosing to go after corporate customers as allies instead of competitors. In 2009, they set up the VCE joint venture as a one-stop shop for data centers, bundling Cisco’s networking equipment and servers with EMC’s storage gear and software from EMC’s VMware Inc subsidiary. VCE has yet to turn a profit after three years, and relations between Cisco and EMC show signs of fraying, according to people familiar with the companies, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Cisco has had internal discussions in the past year about making its own move into the storage market by acquiring one of EMC’s competitors, according to one source. EMC has also considered partnering with or buying Cisco’s smaller networking rivals, other sources said. And in July, when EMC’s VMWare announced plans to buy network technology start-up Nicira, Cisco was taken aback. Cisco had been eyeing Nicira as well and thought it had sealed a $750 million deal for the private company before VMware unexpectedly swooped in, people familiar with that deal said. “There’s no growth to speak of in the technology market. The only way they can grow is to grab share by stepping on somebody else’s toes,” said Fred Hickey, editor of The High-Tech Strategist newsletter, which is widely read by investors. When asked for comment, representatives for Cisco and EMC said they were committed to their partnership. They declined to confirm or deny if they had plans to acquire or partner with other technology companies. “EMC and Cisco remain partners and will continue to shape the future of the data center through a broad relationship spanning many strategic areas,” said a Cisco spokesman. “EMC is thoroughly committed to the strength and longevity of our Cisco partnership,” said an EMC spokesman. Officials with VMware did not respond to a request for comment. EMC owns 80 percent of VMware, while Cisco has a small 5 percent stake. As corporations cut back on IT spending in a weak global economy, experts said technology companies realized that they need to have comprehensive product offerings to drive growth. Companies are increasingly looking to buy their technology in bundles in what is known as converged infrastructure, rather than purchasing items a la carte to assemble themselves. That has led to a wave of mergers and acquisitions, such as Hewlett-Packard Co’s expansion in networking with its purchase of 3Com and Dell Inc’s move into storage through its purchase of EqualLogic. Cisco and EMC have long had an amicable relationship, with EMC CEO Joe Tucci, 65, and Cisco CEO John Chambers, 63, sharing a personal friendship that dated back more than 20 years to when they worked at the now defunct Wang Laboratories. So when Chambers was asked on a conference call how VMware’s acquisition of Nicira would affect Cisco, his unusually sharp tone raised the eyebrows of analysts. Chambers said the partnership with EMC has been strong, but he also made clear that Cisco would not shy from competition. “We are going to be an open player, and we’ve shown in the marketplace when we compete, we can be really, really tough,” Chambers said. The increasing competition between Cisco and EMC raises questions about the future of their loss-making joint venture VCE, which stands for Virtual Computing Environment and last month named Cisco veteran Praveen Akkiraju as its CEO. He told Reuters that he has begun to outline a strategy to guide the venture over the next two to three years that includes new products with intellectual property that VCE will develop on its own. “We are a hyper growth company with tremendous opportunity requiring a lot more structure and focus,” he said. EMC and Cisco have invested about $870 million in VCE, and own 58 percent and 35 percent stakes, respectively. VMware and Intel Corp are also minor investors in VCE. VMware and Intel did not return calls seeking comment. Cisco and EMC have become less interested in VCE because they have come to believe that they need to develop their own products, rather than rely on the partnership, said Kaushik Roy, principal with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, a large venture capital firm. Roy said that in the future customers will want to buy their technology from a single company rather than a joint venture that sells equipment from several manufacturers. EMC, whose market value of $55 billion is nearly half that of Cisco’s $103 billion, has already started to strike out on its own. Earlier in August, EMC forged a partnership with hardware maker Lenovo Group Ltd, pushing it into the server market. But it was VMware’s Nicira deal that really hit home, according to sources. They said Cisco had initially offered about $600 million for the startup founded in 2007, and believed it had completed negotiations when the two parties signed a term sheet in July valuing Nicira at about $750 million. On July 23, Nicira announced it was selling itself to VMware for double the price. It was not clear if VMWare knew it was bidding against Cisco. Several technology bankers, executives and analysts said EMC separately could consider partnering with or acquiring networking technology from Cisco’s competitors, including privately held Arista Networks, Brocade Communications Systems Inc and Juniper Networks Inc. All the companies have business ties with EMC. A spokeswoman for Arista said it is building an independent company and does not comment on M&A; speculation. Brocade and Juniper declined to comment. A source familiar with the matter said there are no active M&A; discussions between Juniper and EMC. For its part, Cisco is also reaching out to EMC rivals. The networking company recently signed a deal to bundle flash storage from Fusion-io Inc with Cisco servers. Fusion-io has a similar deal with storage firm NetApp Inc, a fierce rival of EMC. “Why is Cisco using Fusion-io when it has this JV with EMC?” said Maynard Um, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. “Connect the dots — you have Cisco servers, networking, with Fusion-io and they work with NetApp boxes.” Technology bankers and industry executives speculated that if Cisco wanted to make a big move into storage, NetApp would be a good fit. They said Cisco might also consider Citrix Systems Inc or Red Hat Inc, which compete with VMware in selling virtualization software that boosts the efficiency of servers. NetApp, Citrix and Red Hat declined to comment. ",8232012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-emc-cisco/analysis-cisco-emc-partnership-turning-into-rivalry-idUSBRE87M11J20120823
207,CSCO,Ciena forecast weak as carriers delay projects; shares fall,"(Reuters) - Network equipment maker Ciena Corp CIEN.O posted a higher-than-expected quarterly loss and forecast fourth-quarter revenue below estimates as customers delayed orders, sending its shares down 12 percent in premarket trading. Ciena’s soft outlook dragged down shares of other network gear companies, days after Cisco System Inc’s (CSCO.O) surprise dividend hike came as a relief to investors in a sector hit by slowing technology spending. A faltering U.S. recovery and weakness in Europe has hurt network equipment makers as their biggest customers, telecom service providers, cut spending and delay purchase of new equipment. “We are experiencing the effects of ongoing macroeconomic challenges and slower than expected roll-outs of new design wins,” CEO Gary Smith said on Thursday. Europe continued to be the company’s weakest market and had deteriorated during the third quarter, Smith said on a conference call with analysts. He added that though North America had held steady, customers were exercising more caution. Ciena, which makes optical switches used by telecom carriers such as AT&T; Inc (T.N) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) to manage load on their networks, had said earlier this year it expected business to improve in the later half of 2012. Net loss narrowed to $29.8 million, or 30 cents per share, in the third quarter, from $31.5 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company posted a loss of 4 cents per share, compared with analysts’ expectation of a 2 cents per share loss, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 9 percent to $474.1 million, in line with estimates, but gross margin slipped about 4 percentage points. The company forecast fourth-quarter revenue between $455 million and $480 million. Analysts expected revenue of $499.7 million. Shares of the company, which closed at $16.72 on the Nasdaq on Wednesday, fell to $14.84 in trading before the bell. Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR.N) shares fell 2 percent, while Cisco (CSCO.O) was down about 1 percent in premarket trading.

208,CSCO,Cisco CEO: Next US president must take page from Clinton's book,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc CEO John Chambers, a supporter of Mitt Romney, says the country’s next head of state should take his cues from former President Bill Clinton, regardless of who emerges as the victor in November’s election. “There’s a lot to learn from President Clinton. It kills me as a strong Republican saying it, but he was the most effective president during my lifetime,” Chambers told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday. Chambers said Clinton worked with businesses to generate jobs and growth in real income for families, while taking the budget from a deficit to a surplus. “And when business got out of line, he smacked them,” Chambers said. Some technology industry leaders view President Barack Obama as anti-business because of uncertainty blamed on the Dodd-Frank financial regulation reform and healthcare overhaul. Obama was the darling of the technology world during his campaign in 2008, but Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, a former private equity executive, has made inroads in Silicon Valley. “The business community is very comfortable with Romney,” Chambers said. But no matter who won, the challenges remained the same. “If we don’t deal with the fiscal cliff and don’t deal with predictability on taxes for both citizens and business, with the rest of the world in a struggling state, this is really bad for us,” he added. The “fiscal cliff” refers to the impact of around $500 billion in expiring tax cuts and automatic spending reductions set for 2013 as a result of successive failures by Congress to agree on some orderly alternative method of reducing budget deficits. Asked if he would consider accepting a political appointment himself, Chambers said he had been asked by previous administrations but turned them down. “I don’t enjoy politics,” he said. “I like to get things done and I like Republicans and Democrats, and that doesn’t always work well.” About his own future at Cisco, where he has been in charge for almost 18 years, Chambers repeated he would not be in that role in two to four years and that the company had a few candidates as potential successors. “We have always had a hit-by-the-bus scenario that’s Gary Moore for me,” Chambers said, speaking of Cisco’s Chief Operating Officer. Cisco wanted any transition to be as smooth as possible and there were around 10 candidates who were potential candidates. “When we evolve the CEO you shouldn’t even notice it is happening,” Chambers said. “We have a next generation of leaders at multiple levels. We have three to five at the first wave and probably four to five in the second.” He said the company made a point of moving executives around to ensure they were not “kept in silos,” citing Edzard Overbeek as an example. Overbeek was head of Cisco’s sales in the Asia Pacific region, but was recently named senior vice president for global.

Cisco itself is more likely to look for growth outside the United States however, Chambers said. “We will see growth in the U.S. and we will selectively acquire in the U.S. but we prefer to use our global opportunity.” Cisco this year acquired UK-based TV software developer NDS for $5 billion, its biggest deal since its $3.3 billion purchase of Norwegian conferencing company Tandberg in 2009. Asked about potential acquisitions in data storage, Chambers said it was not a high priority as Cisco intended to keep its  partnership with leading data storage company EMC even if the two were not as close as they used to be due to plans by EMC unit VMware to buy network technology start-up Nicira. “EMC will be my best partner but not as strong as before because of the Nicira acquisition where we are going to compete in terms of direction.” Chambers admitted that it may be too late for Cisco to enter the data storage segment on its own. “Storage is an evolution and I think we are much better off partnering with leaders like EMC and Netapp than doing it all ourselves and I think that market has probably moved in terms of opportunity.”",9262012,http://www.reuters.com/article/cisco-election/update-1-cisco-ceo-next-us-president-must-take-page-from-clintons-book-idUSL1E8KPQV920120926
213,CSCO,Cisco taps two execs in CEO race,"(Reuters) - Networking equipment company Cisco Systems is expanding the roles of two executives it has identified as possible successors to long-serving Chief Executive John Chambers. Chambers, who took the helm at Cisco in 1995 and turned the small company into a multi-billion dollar operation, has said he aims to step down in two to four years. Cisco appears to be taking a cue from other large U.S. firms like media giant Disney that are seeking a smooth CEO transition by tapping possible heirs years in advance. Cisco said on Thursday that Chief Operating Officer Gary Moore, 63, will also assume the role of president overseeing end-to-end operations and aligning all businesses with Cisco’s long-term strategy. Moore was named Cisco’s COO in February 2011. Rob Lloyd, 56, who has led the company’s global operations since April 2009, will assume responsibility for Cisco’s development and sales units, the company said. “You’re seeing both of those leaders taking a major step forward in terms of their responsibilities and expectations and you will see me staying focused on strategy,” Chambers told Reuters on Thursday. “Our goal is to make this transition not just at my level very smooth. The way you do that is to move people around functionally and to give them more responsibility and then see how they do,” Chambers said. Chambers is one of the longest serving CEO’s in the tech industry and the question of who will succeed him has come up in the past, especially when executives considered potential heirs left Cisco. Analyst Zeus Kerravala of ZKresearch said both Lloyd and Moore were well respected. “Gary Moore is an excellent operational person...and Cisco runs more efficiently than before he took on the role while Rob Lloyd has a very good feel for how Cisco operates globally,” Kerravala said. He added that Moore may have somewhat of an advantage because he spent a lot of time with Cisco’s customer advocacy group. “That experience will serve him well,” Kerravala said. Last year speculation over Chambers swirled after he famously admitted Cisco had lost its way and kicked off a restructuring program. “I am now asking Gary and Rob to do what I spend a lot of my time on which is taking key emerging countries and building a lasting relationship at all levels at the government leaders, business leaders, corporate social responsibility, etc,” Chambers said. “Last week Gary was in Turkey and Rob was in Brazil, no accident there,” Chambers quipped.

217,CSCO,Cisco boosts virtual networking with vCider acquisition,"Oct 4 (Reuters) - Networking equipment company Cisco Systems Inc said on Thursday it has acquired virtual networking company vCider to defend itself from competitors in the cloud computing business. VCider, a privately held company founded in 2010, specializes in offering products that let organizations create virtual private networks and link data centers. Cisco, which plans to integrate vCider into its cloud computing unit, did not disclose financial terms. Cisco has been sounding out potential acquisitions in the virtualized networking market for some time but in July lost out to joint-venture partner VMware Iv, which bought technology start-up Nicira for 1.05 billion. Nicira like vCider is focused on software defined networking (SDN), a technology that some analysts see as a threat to Cisco’s core business. “In our view, Cisco’s dominant share in switching puts it most at risk from SDN adoption,” ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall said in a research note. “The acquisition helps Cicsco add software/virtualization expertise. We also see it in part as a response to VMware’s acquisition of Nicira,” Marshall added. Cisco and VMware’s parent company EMC Corp in 2009 set up a joint venture as a one-stop shop for data centers, bundling Cisco’s networking equipment and servers with EMC’s storage gear and software from VMware.

218,CSCO,Exclusive: Cisco cuts ties to China's ZTE after Iran probe,"LONDON (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc. has ended a longstanding sales partnership with ZTE Corp after an internal investigation into allegations that the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker sold Cisco networking gear to Iran. Cisco’s probe followed stories by Reuters in March and April that documented how Shenzhen, China-based ZTE had sold banned computer equipment from Cisco and other U.S. companies to Iran’s largest telecom firm. ZTE also agreed last year to ship millions of dollars worth of additional U.S. tech products, including Cisco switches, to a unit of the consortium that controls the telecom firm. The stories sparked internal probes by the companies involved, as well as investigations by the U.S. Commerce Department, a congressional committee, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ZTE’s general counsel at its Texas-based subsidiary alleged that the parent company plotted a cover-up, including possibly shredding documents, after the first Reuters story broke. The FBI has launched a criminal probe into the allegations. The U.S. House of Representatives’ Intelligence Committee said in a draft of a report to be released Monday that ZTE and fellow Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd should be shut out of the U.S. market because potential Chinese state influence on them poses a security threat. Both companies deny the allegation. David Dai Shu, a ZTE spokesman, said of Cisco’s decision to cut ties: “ZTE is highly concerned with the matter and is communicating with Cisco. At the same time, ZTE is actively cooperating with the U.S. government about the probe to Iran. We believe it will be properly addressed.” In a recent interview, John Chambers, Cisco’s chief executive, declined to discuss the results of the company’s investigation of ZTE’s sales to Iran. But he said Cisco doesn’t “tolerate any direct or indirect” sales of its equipment to embargoed countries such as Iran. “And when that occurs, we step up and deal with it very firmly. So I think you can assume that you will not see that happen again.” Cisco and ZTE partnered for the past seven years in a relationship that was at times rocky, according to a former Cisco executive with knowledge of the matter. ZTE described the initial partnership as an effort to develop business opportunities in China and Asia Pacific, excluding Japan. The partnership expanded about five years ago when Cisco began viewing ZTE as a means to combat Huawei, the world’s second-biggest maker of telecoms equipment by revenue after Sweden’s Ericsson. Huawei had been beating out Cisco in emerging markets by offering significantly cheaper products. Part of Cisco’s strategy, the former Cisco executive said, was “we would license technology to ZTE and they would produce equipment locally, and we could therefore have a range of equipment in the marketplace that would be cost-competitive with Huawei.” ZTE was “reasonably successful” in reselling Cisco products inside China, where it was well entrenched in the marketplace, the former executive said. But the plan to develop projects jointly, and offer them in markets such as Africa, floundered. The two companies couldn’t get their teams to collaborate and clashed over the U.S. market, this person said. “ZTE wanted to bring things to market in the U.S. with our help. We really didn’t want them to do that,” the former executive said. By 2010, the partnership had basically ended, although ZTE continued as an authorized distributor and reseller of Cisco products, according to a person familiar with the matter. The ZTE spokesman did not comment on its relationship with Cisco. ZTE has continued to do business in Iran where American-made tech products long have been subject to U.S. sanctions. A parts list dated July 2011 for an equipment contract between ZTE and Telecommunication Co of Iran (TCI) included several Cisco switches. ZTE later agreed to sell five Cisco switches to a unit of the consortium that controls TCI, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. After the Reuters report in March, ZTE, China’s second largest telecom equipment maker, said it would “curtail” its business with Iran. Ashley Kyle Yablon, ZTE’s Texas-based general counsel, gave the FBI an affidavit in May in which he alleged the company had plotted to cover up the Iran sales. The affidavit became public in July. ZTE recently placed Yablon on administrative leave, according to his attorney, Tom Mills.

219,CSCO,Polycom seeks edge over rivals with new videoconferencing product,"Oct 8 (Reuters) - Polycom, which competes with Cisco in videoconferencing, hopes to move ahead of the pack with its new cloud-based product in a market it says will be worth $12 billion by 2015. Videoconferencing is on the brink of widespread adoption as technology moves from expensive and complex boardroom products to technology that allows video communication on desktops, smartphones and tablets, and vendors are scrambling for their piece of the pie. “Video is becoming more and more mission-critical, but it has not been taken up massively because of interoperability issues and inconsistent user experiences,” said Sudhakar Ramakrishna, president of Products and Services at Polycom. Polycom said on Monday that its RealPresence CloudAXIS Suite addresses those problems because it will let customers add anyone on Skype, Facebook, Google Talk and other business video applications to their video conferences from a browser via a hyperlink. The product will be available to service providers and large businesses by the end of the first quarter, but Polycom will be running limited trial runs in the current quarter, the company said. Polycom has been at pains to fend off larger rival Cisco, which dominates the videoconferencing market with its Telepresence virtual conference rooms, and competitors that offer free technology such as Microsoft’s Skype, Google and Apple’s face time. The success of the cloud-based product is vital to Polycom, which still generates most of its revenue from hardware-based systems as it shifts to a software-based model while rivals muscle in on its turf. That transition is expected to impact earnings over the next 12 to 18 months, analysts have said. At the same time, rivals such as privately held companies Blue Jeans Networks, Vidyo and Avaya as well as business software maker Citrix are making inroads with their own technologies. However, Forrester Research analyst Philipp Karcher said Polycom’s product was impressive even if it was not the game changer Polycom claimed it is. “It is an evolution,” Karcher said, adding that there was a lot of interest in browser-based video conferencing but that Cisco “is also moving very aggressively into the web browser paradigm with WebEx and WebEx.” Polycom’s announcement may also be a preemptive move to make itself more independent of Microsoft, which is a key user of Polycom products in its Lync corporate video, email and messaging product. It is still unclear how Microsoft will incorporate Skype, but Polycom has acknowledged in its annual report the risk that its products could be replaced by Skype. Mizuho Securities analyst Joanna Makris has said an integration of Skype into Lync would mean “game over” for Polycom. Polycom’s Ramakrishna said the product announcement did not change the company’s relationship with Microsoft, which was “a key strategic partner.”",10082012,http://www.reuters.com/article/polycom-videoconferencing/polycom-seeks-edge-over-rivals-with-new-videoconferencing-product-idUSL1E8L801G20121008

Huawei, the world’s second-largest maker of routers, has repeatedly said Cisco’s claims were unjustified as the Chinese company had received the disputed source code form a third party. The company, along with ZTE Corp,, is the focus of a U.S. House Intelligence Committee report that said Beijing could use equipment made by the two companies to engage in espionage and endanger vital systems. The panel said U.S. companies should stop doing business with Huawei and ZTE, and the committee chairman urged that Canadian companies do the same. Australia, for its part, has banned Huawei from helping build its national broadband network. Cisco said it was now releasing parts of an expert’s report in a blog by Mark Chandler, general counsel at Cisco, “so the world could learn what really happened.” In the segments released it said that “the exactness of the comments and spacing not only indicate that Huawei has access to the Cisco code but that the Cisco code was electronically copied and inserted into (Huawei’s code).” The case between the two companies was eventually dropped. Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers has said that Huawei does not always play by the rules. Earlier this year, Cisco Executive Vice President Rob Lloyd said, “We clearly know that our customers view innovation from Cisco and they don’t see the same from Huawei.

That’s not the forte of Huawei.” In the blog post on Thursday Cisco took pains to make it clear that it did not have a dispute with the Chinese government but rather that it was at odds with a business rival. “We respect the efforts the Chinese government is making to increase intellectual property protection,” the post said. “Rather, this dispute involved a very simple claim that one company used the other’s trade secrets and copyrighted materials without permission.” Cisco has been doing business in China since 1994.

226,CSCO,"Cisco to meet quarterly target, disappoint on outlook","(Reuters) - Tech investors hoping for good news may have to look further than Cisco Systems Inc’s (CSCO.O) quarterly report as analysts expect Chief Executive John Chambers to be pessimistic in his forecast for the coming year. Cisco, which is expected to meet estimates when it reports its first-quarter results on Tuesday, is seen as harbinger in terms of spending on information technology because of its global reach and customers across all sectors. Chambers has been warning since April that businesses are reluctant to spend and that conditions will get worse before they get better. Most analysts expect him to stay conservative given continued financial weakness in Europe and a drop in U.S. federal spending as concerns mount over the so-called fiscal cliff, which refers to a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts that loom at the end of the year and may tip the economy into recession. JP Morgan analyst Rod Hall said he has changed his investment recommendation on Cisco to neutral from overweight in light of weak corporate and government spending as well as the continued economic pressure in Europe, but also in regard to longer term risks. “To be clear, we’re not making a call on (fiscal quarter)FQ1’13, but do believe FQ2’13 guidance is likely to disappoint and expect 2013 to be a tough year as macro pressures persist,” he said. Hall also said he anticipated that Cisco could face some risks by 2014 from technological developments such as software defined networking (SDN). SDN lets customers create virtual networks that can operate independently of underlying physical networks, which may pose a threat to Cisco’s network dominance. BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long said that in light of a cautious outlook BMO has reduced its 2013 earnings per share outlook to $1.94 from $1.96 and lowered its sales outlook for Cisco to revenue of $48.9 billion from $49.2 billion. “October results should at least meet expectations, though guidance is likely more at risk,” Long said in a note. Analysts, on average, expect Cisco to post EPS of 46 cents and revenue of $11.79 billion in the quarter that runs until end-October, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Wedbush analyst Rohit Chopra said Cisco has proven it can ride out tough times. “Despite the macroeconomic environment, we believe Cisco is well positioned given its track record in navigating challenging environments, its broad portfolio of products, and continued actions to control its cost structure ahead of its rivals,” Chopra said. “We advise long-term investors looking for a well-capitalized company that can weather an uncertain spending environment to own the stock.” Cisco shares were up slightly at $16.90 on Monday. The stock has lost around 10 percent in the past month and is down 7 percent year-to-date.

However, he added that “we see signs of improvement in the U.S. in enterprise, service provider and commercial.” Still, Chamber said, it was too early to speak of a trend “though we are continuing to see what we like.” Cisco said it expects earnings per share, excluding items, of 47 cents to 48 cents in its fiscal second quarter, which runs until the end of January. A year earlier it reported EPS of 47 cents. It also said it sees revenue growth in a range of 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent, compared with 11.6 percent growth in the second quarter of 2012. Chambers said he would give a long-term outlook at the company’s financial analyst day next month. Analysts had been expecting a cautious outlook. “Considering the sluggish macro environment it’s good that they are expecting growth at all,” said ZK Research analyst Zeus Kerravala. He added that Cisco has been “pretty accurate” at predicting economic conditions. In its first quarter, which ran until the end of October, Cisco surprised analysts with a solid beat, due to cost cuts and the company’s broad product range. First-quarter net income, excluding items, rose 10.6 percent to $2.6 billion, or 48 cents per share, compared with analysts’ average estimate of 46 cents a share as compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The product allows customers to change via software the networks and data centers that they access, avoiding upgrades to expensive and proprietary hardware, and could threaten the core business of networking equipment makers such as Cisco Systems Inc. Although the nascent SDN market is still small, its growth potential has spurred heavy interest in acquiring startups, especially since VMware bought Nicira in July for around $1 billion. “This is a very big change in how we build networks,” said Big Switch co-founder Guido Appenzeller, who started the company with former Cisco product manager Kyle Forster in March 2010. The startup is backed by ex-Cisco executive Mike Volpi through Index Ventures as well as Goldman Sachs, Khosla Ventures and Redpoint Ventures. The company said its partners include Arista Networks, Broadcom Corp, Citrix Systems Inc, Dell Inc , Juniper Networks Inc and Microsoft Corp . Interest in the SDN sector has been heating up. “There are currently 20 to 25 venture-funded SDN companies and a lot of noise in the market,” said Brian Marshall, an analyst at ISI group. Startup Midokura launched its MidoNet software platform in the United States last month and Embrane, founded in December 2011 by Dante Malagrino, another ex-Cisco manager, has launched Heleos. Startup Vyatta was bought by Brocade Communications Systems Inc earlier this month. “We do believe that SDN is here to stay and will eventually cause substantial shifts in the networking market, beginning in the data center,” said JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall. “We don’t see SDN as a real earnings risk until late 2014. However, we believe the technology is here to stay and expect the hype cycle to increase in 2013 as numerous trials deploy,” Hall added.

231,CSCO,"Cisco to meet quarterly target, disappointment expected on outlook","(Reuters) - Tech investors hoping for good news may have to look further than Cisco Systems Inc’s (CSCO.O) quarterly report as analysts expect Chief Executive John Chambers to be pessimistic in his forecast for the coming year. Cisco, which is expected to meet estimates when it reports its first-quarter results on Tuesday, is seen as harbinger in terms of spending on information technology because of its global reach and customers across all sectors. Chambers has been warning since April that businesses are reluctant to spend and that conditions will get worse before they get better. Most analysts expect him to stay conservative given continued financial weakness in Europe and a drop in U.S. federal spending as concerns mount over the so-called fiscal cliff, which refers to a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts that loom at the end of the year and may tip the economy into recession. JP Morgan analyst Rod Hall said he has changed his investment recommendation on Cisco to neutral from overweight in light of weak corporate and government spending as well as the continued economic pressure in Europe, but also in regard to longer term risks. “To be clear, we’re not making a call on (fiscal quarter)FQ1’13, but do believe FQ2’13 guidance is likely to disappoint and expect 2013 to be a tough year as macro pressures persist,” he said. Hall also said he anticipated that Cisco could face some risks by 2014 from technological developments such as software defined networking (SDN). SDN lets customers create virtual networks that can operate independently of underlying physical networks, which may pose a threat to Cisco’s network dominance. BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long said that in light of a cautious outlook BMO has reduced its 2013 earnings per share outlook to $1.94 from $1.96 and lowered its sales outlook for Cisco to revenue of $48.9 billion from $49.2 billion. “October results should at least meet expectations, though guidance is likely more at risk,” Long said in a note. Analysts, on average, expect Cisco to post EPS of 46 cents and revenue of $11.79 billion in the quarter that runs until end-October, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Wedbush analyst Rohit Chopra said Cisco has proven it can ride out tough times. “Despite the macroeconomic environment, we believe Cisco is well positioned given its track record in navigating challenging environments, its broad portfolio of products, and continued actions to control its cost structure ahead of its rivals,” Chopra said. “We advise long-term investors looking for a well-capitalized company that can weather an uncertain spending environment to own the stock.” Cisco shares were up slightly at $16.90 on Monday. The stock has lost around 10 percent in the past month and is down 7 percent year-to-date.

232,CSCO,"Wall Street drops on deficit, Middle East concerns","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks slid on Wednesday with declines accelerating after President Barack Obama set up a drawn-out fight over the fiscal cliff when he stuck to his pledge to raise taxes on the wealthy, and as violence increased in the Middle East. Obama, in his first press conference since re-election, held to his position that marginal tax rates will have to rise to tackle the nation’s deficits. With talks over solving the U.S. “fiscal cliff” in early stages, investors are reacting to the uncertainty by shedding positions. “I think we will have a last-minute cliffhanger solution,” said Michael Cheah, portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management in Jersey City, New Jersey, about a deal to avoid the so-called cliff. “In the meantime, the market is going to get punched every day.” Without a deal, a series of mandated tax hikes and spending cuts will start to take effect early next year that could push the U.S. economy into a recession. Taxes on capital gains and dividends could rise as part of the negotiations, pushing investors to sell this year and pay lower taxes on their gains. Adding to the selling pressure, Israel launched a major offensive against Palestinian militants in Gaza, killing the military commander of Hamas in an air strike and threatening an invasion of the enclave. Egypt said it recalled its ambassador from Israel in response. “We know Europe’s in trouble, China’s slowing down ... and now you’ve got the Middle East flaring up again. It’s all hitting at once, and obviously, the market is taking a ‘sell first, ask questions later’ approach,” said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati. Industrial shares led the decline, dragged lower in part by a 1 percent spike in crude prices after the Israeli offensive on Gaza. The S&P; industrial sector index .GSPI fell 2.5 percent. Wall Street had opened higher after Dow component Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) reported first-quarter earnings and revenue late Tuesday that beat expectations, driving its stock up 4.8 percent to $17.66. But the positive momentum was short-lived. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 185.23 points, or 1.45 percent, to 12,570.95 at the close. The S&P; 500 .SPX dropped 19.04 points, or 1.39 percent, to 1,355.49. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC lost 37.08 points, or 1.29 percent, to 2,846.81. Both the Dow industrials and the Nasdaq ended at their lowest levels since late June. The S&P; 500 has fallen 5.1 percent in the six sessions since election night. Wednesday marked the benchmark index’s lowest close since July 25. The Russell 2000  tumbled 2 percent. The Dow Jones Transportation average .DJT slid 2.6 percent. FedEx Corp (FDX.N) shares dropped 3.7 percent to $87.12. Bank of America (BAC.N) shares lost 3.6 percent to $8.99. In contrast, Facebook (FB.O) shares jumped 12.6 percent to $22.36 as investors were relieved that expiring trading restrictions on a huge block of shares did not trigger an immediate wave of insider selling. Teen clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co (ANF.N) jumped 34.4 percent to $41.92 after the company reported unexpectedly improved third-quarter results and a full-year outlook that exceeded Wall Street’s forecasts. About 7.53 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, more than the daily average so far this year of about 6.51 billion shares. On the NYSE, decliners outnumbered advancers by a ratio of almost 9 to 1. On the Nasdaq, about four stocks fell for every one that rose.

Wall Street had opened higher after Dow component Cisco Systems Inc reported first-quarter earnings and revenue late Tuesday that beat expectations, driving its shares up 5.8 percent to $17.83. But the positive momentum was short-lived. “Again today, the market started off hoping for an optimistic tone out of Washington on the ‘fiscal cliff’ issue, which spurred a move higher. But then, we got nothing and gains basically fizzled out. We are probably going to have many more days like this,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab’s Center for Financial Research. “It’s been very hard recently to be optimistic about anything and to have a real buying interest.” The S&P; 500 has fallen 3.8 percent over the past five trading days. The index closed below its 200-day moving average for a fourth day in a row on Tuesday, a technical indicator that suggests recent declines could gain momentum. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 83.26 points, or 0.65 percent, at 12,672.92. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 7.61 points, or 0.55 percent, at 1,366.92. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 10.90 points, or 0.38 percent, at 2,872.99. “Under this scenario, there is near-term downside risk to 1,330-1,350 (on the S&P; 500), the index’s lower trend channel extended from its June low,” said Ari Wald, an analyst at PrinceRidge Group, in New York. Despite Cisco’s gains Wednesday, the broader technology sector has been weak lately, dropping almost 10 percent over the past two months on earnings disappointments from Google  and others. It was the worst-performing sector on Tuesday. In earnings news, Abercrombie & Fitch Co soared 27.8 percent to $39.85 after reporting a steep rise in its quarterly profit and a full-year forecast that beat analysts’ estimates. Staples Inc rose 1.8 percent to $11.46 after posting earnings that beat expectations. Abercrombie, Cisco and Staples ranked as the S&P; 500’s top three percentage gainers. But broader trading will likely be partially dictated by macroeconomic issues as investors grapple with the impact of Europe’s debt crisis and the U.S. “fiscal cliff” - a series of  mandated tax hikes and spending cuts that start to take effect next year. Analysts say serious fiscal negotiations are still weeks away, but Congress’ failure to reach a deal could tip the world’s largest economy into recession. Retail sales fell 0.3 percent in October, hurt by the impact of Superstorm Sandy in the U.S. Northeast. The drop was slightly more than expected, but stocks barely reacted to the data. The overall U.S. Producer Price Index fell 0.2 percent in October, contrary to economists’ consensus forecast for a gain of 0.2 percent. A separate piece of data showed U.S. business inventories rose more than expected in September but stocks excluding automobiles were flat for a second month, which could prompt economists to lower their estimates for third-quarter growth. The FTSEurofirst-300 index of European shares lost 1 percent as Greece’s unresolved crisis raised questions about the region’s potential for economic growth, while anti-austerity strikes across southern Europe added to concerns that fiscal reforms would be politically difficult to implement.",11142012,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-usa-stocks/us-stocks-wall-st-slips-on-angst-about-fiscal-cliff-and-europe-idUSL1E8ME70E20121114

245,CSCO,Cisco to buy cloud-networking start-up Meraki for $1.2 billion,"(Reuters) - Networking equipment company Cisco Systems Inc said it will buy privately held cloud networking company Meraki for $1.2 billion in cash as part of its cloud and networking strategy. Cisco said the acquisition of Meraki, which was founded in 2006 by members of MIT’s Laboratory for Computer Science, is expected to close in the second quarter of Cisco’s 2013 fiscal year and is subject to regulatory approval. Cisco’s second quarter runs until the end of January. Meraki - funded by Sequoia Capital and Google Inc - offers Wi-Fi technology, switching, security and mobile device management from the cloud with a focus on mid-sized businesses. “This is a very logical move for Cisco,” said ZK research analyst Zeus Kerravala. He said the deal will allow Cisco to offer alternative solutions to traditional Wi-Fi deployment models like smaller competitors, such as Aruba Networks and Ruckus Wireless, which debuted on Friday. “Cisco didn’t really have anything to counter that before,” Kerravala noted. Meraki’s Chief Executive Sanjit Biswas said in a letter to employees posted on the company website that Cisco had approached the company several weeks ago.

246,CSCO,UPDATE 1-Cisco to buy cloud-networking start-up Meraki for $1.2 bln,"By Nicola Leske Nov 18 (Reuters) - Networking equipment company Cisco Systems Inc said it will buy privately held cloud networking company Meraki for $1.2 billion in cash as part of its cloud and networking strategy. Cisco said the acquisition of Meraki, which was founded in 2006 by members of MIT’s Laboratory for Computer Science, is expected to close in the second quarter of Cisco’s 2013 fiscal year and is subject to regulatory approval. Cisco’s second quarter runs until the end of January. Meraki - funded by Sequoia Capital and Google Inc - offers Wi-Fi technology, switching, security and mobile device management from the cloud with a focus on mid-sized businesses. “This is a very logical move for Cisco,” said ZK research analyst Zeus Kerravala. He said the deal will allow Cisco to offer alternative solutions to traditional Wi-Fi deployment models like smaller competitors, such as Aruba Networks and Ruckus Wireless , which debuted on Friday. “Cisco didn’t really have anything to counter that before,” Kerravala noted. Meraki’s Chief Executive Sanjit Biswas said in a letter to employees posted on the company website that Cisco had approached the company several weeks ago. The company’s founders had at first rejected the offer in favor of continuing Meraki’s strategy aimed at an initial public listing. “After several weeks of consideration, we decided late last week that joining Cisco was the right path for Meraki,” Biswas said.

253,CSCO,XxCORRECTED-INSIGHT-Lawyers gain from 'say-on-pay' suits targeting US firms,"(Corrects 14th paragraph to show Cisco lawsuit has not been dismissed) By Nate Raymond NEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Since the Dodd-Frank law gave shareholders a say in executive pay in 2010, c ourts have routinely rebuffed efforts by shareholders to force companies to heed their voice. Now, lawyers have found a new way to bring lawsuits over executive pay, resulting in a handful of legal settlements. But the settlements to date have produced no changes in executive compensation and no money for investors. In fact, the main financial beneficiary so far has been a small New York law firm that brought the bulk of the cases. The law firm, Faruqi & Faruqi, said the settlements benefit shareholders by giving them the information they need to make investment decisions, but it declined to comment on monetary details. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires companies listed in the United States to hold shareholder votes at least every three years on the compensation of top executives. These “say-on-pay” votes are advisory and nonbinding. While most of them pass, a few fail, sometimes resulting in shareholder lawsuits against company directors. Of the 12 such cases that have been decided by courts, 11 have been dismissed, according to a report by the law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman. The lawsuits filed by Faruqi & Faruqi, however, are brought  before votes are even taken and do not challenge compensation packages directly. Instead, the lawsuits accuse companies of failing to give shareholders enough information on compensation plans to make informed votes. This can either be executive compensation, which is subject to the advisory votes, or employee share plans, which require shareholder approval. In both cases, the lawsuits seek to prevent votes from going forward at annual shareholder meetings. Some 20 public companies including Microsoft Corp, H&R; Block Inc and Clorox Co have been hit with these lawsuits in the past year, according the report by Pillsbury and court records. Pillsbury usually represents companies that are defending themselves against shareholder lawsuits. It is not representing any defendants in the current wave of cases. At least six of the new cases have resulted in settlements in which the companies have agreed to give shareholders more information on the pay of their executives or on the employee share plans. The settlements have also resulted in fees of up to $625,000 for the lawyers who brought the cases. Juan Monteverde, the partner at Faruqi who is leading these lawsuits, said his firm was providing shareholders with information to protect their investments, even if there was no monetary award. “The settlements confer a benefit to shareholders by providing adequate disclosure necessary to make decisions on important issues,” Monteverde said. The extra information sought has included such things as the  data the company reviewed in determining executive compensation and analyses showing the effect on shareholders of increasing the number of shares in a stock plan. Lawyers from defense firms, however, have taken note that while settlements have provided additional disclosures and legal fees for Faruqi, they have netted no cash for shareholders. “It’s a shakedown for a quick buck,” said Boris Feldman, a lawyer at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati who is defending a case against cancer radiation company Accuray Inc. Mark Chandler, the general counsel of Cisco Systems Inc , w hich is facing one of the lawsuits, s aid the practice is a “new cottage industry for plaintiffs’ lawyers.” Cisco makes sure its proxy disclosures are thorough, he said. Monteverde, the partner at Faruqi, declined to comment on the criticism. The new strategy mirrors lawsuits in which shareholders have been able to delay mergers and acquisitions by bringing lawsuits accusing company directors of trying to sell companies at an unfair price. Settlements quickly follow and, as in the new say-on-pay lawsuits, the accords usually involve more disclosures from the company, no cash for the class and fees for the lawyers. Many of the M&A; lawsuits are brought in Delaware, a major venue for business litigation, where judges have become increasingly critical of settlements in which attorneys get paid but plaintiffs receive more information but no cash. The compensation lawsuits, however, were filed not in Delaware but in the states where target companies are headquartered. Judges have given the cases a mixed reaction. In an early victory for Faruqi, Superior Court Judge James Kleinberg in Santa Clara, California, on April 10 blocked a vote at networking equipment manufacturer Brocade Communications Systems Inc scheduled for two days later. Brocade was seeking to increase the number of shares available under its stock plan. The plaintiff alleged the company failed to disclose details and misrepresented how the increase would dilute investors’ holdings. Kleinberg said the plaintiff had shown a “substantial likelihood” of success in establishing the company did not disclose material information about a proposed increase in shares granted under the incentive plan. “Denial of the proposed injunction would forever preclude the Brocade shareholders from casting a fully-informed vote on a proposal that could have dilutive effects on their shares, and after-the-fact damages calculations would be speculative and ineffective,” he wrote. Instead of delaying the annual vote, Brocade reached a settlement on April 11 in which it disclosed more details about its stock incentive plan while paying $625,000 in fees to the plaintiffs’ lawyers, which were led by Faruqi. John Noh, a spokesman for Brocade, declined to comment. The plaintiffs in all of Faruqi’s cases were individual investors. One plaintiff, Natalie Gordon, is named in three of the lawsuits. The lawsuits gave no details about Gordon or the other plaintiffs, except to say that they are investors in the companies. Gordon could not be located for comment. The one case that was not brought by Faruqi was filed on behalf of an institutional investor, the St. Louis Police Retirement System, against blood analytics company Abaxis Inc . In that case, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on Oct. 23 determined the plaintiff would likely succeed in establishing that the company failed to reference material information on its equity incentive plan in its proxy statement and blocked a shareholder meeting from going ahead. “The law requires that when a board of directors seeks a shareholder vote, the board must fully and fairly disclose all material information regarding the matters on which votes are sought,” said Eric Zagar, a lawyer at Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check who represented the plaintiff. A spokesman for Abaxis did not respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit is ongoing. At least five companies have reached settlements rather than fight an injunction demand, according to Pillsbury’s report. Most recently, WebMD Health Corp agreed on Nov. 15 to a disclosure-only settlement that would pay investors nothing but award Faruqi at least $250,000. As part of the settlement, WebMD provided supplemental disclosures to investors that detailed the “guiding philosophy” of the board’s compensation committee and more details on why it had approved an increase in the number of shares available under a stock plan. Representatives of WebMD and the other companies that settled - Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc, NeoStem Inc and Applied Minerals Inc - did not respond to requests for comment. Other companies, though, have fought on and recently some judges have sided with them. At least five times, judges have denied injunction requests, the Pillsbury report said. In a case involving Clorox, Superior Court Judge Wynne Carvill in Alameda County, California, rejected an injunction request on Nov. 13. While noting the “public controversy surrounding executive compensation,” Carvill said there was “no risk of any interim, much less irreparable harm” if a say-on-pay vote went forward. “This is not a merger or takeover case that would require the court after a trial on the merits to ‘unscramble the eggs’ if plaintiff were to prevail,” Carvill wrote. Kathryn Caulfield, a spokeswoman for Clorox, said the company was “pleased with the ruling.” A day later, New York state Supreme Court Justice Thomas Whelan in Suffolk County rejected a similar injunction request in a case involving Globecomm Systems Inc. Jonathan Wagner, a lawyer at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel who represents Globecomm, said courts recognize that the information the plaintiffs are seeking is not material. The plaintiffs are trying to turn the rules for disclosure in compensation proposals “upside down,” he said. Elsewhere in New York, state Supreme Court Justice Vito DeStefano in Nassau County on Nov. 16 rejected an attempt to get an injunction in an investor lawsuit against Hain Celestial Group Inc. The chance of shareholders being irreparably harmed by letting the say-on-pay v ote go forward was “purely speculative given the advisory nature of the vote,” DeStefano wrote. A spokesman for Hain Celestial did not respond to a request for comment. Not all of the cases make it to a decision or settlement. In some cases, Faruqi dropped lawsuits before a judge could rule on the injunction request and without a settlement. Last week, Faruqi withdrew a lawsuit against Microsoft. The company said in a statement that the lawsuit was “meritless” and that it was “confident that courts will continue to recognize these cases don’t serve the best interests of shareholders.” Despite the recent defense wins, few lawyers believe they’ve seen the last of this kind of lawsuit. Faruqi last week issued a news release saying it was investigating the directors of Greenbrier Companies Inc  over their conduct in seeking shareholders’ approval of an amendment to its stock incentive plan. Jack Isselmann, a spokesman for Greenbrier, said the company believed the investigation “is without merit.” Sarah Good, who co-authored Pillsbury’s report, said there was little companies could do to avoid being hit with these lawsuits. “Where the plaintiffs securities bar sees that they will get a return on their investment, they’re going to keep filing them,” she said.

254,CSCO,Cisco bets on software and services for mid-term growth,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cisco Systems laid out its mid-term growth strategy on Friday, betting on increased demand for software, services and security as it strives to become the world’s leading information technology company. Cisco, whose business roots in routers and switches that move Internet traffic still generate about 50 percent of its revenue, has been steadily expanding its other offerings including data centers, network security and video conferencing. In five years Cisco plans to double revenue from software, which is currently at $6 billion, Chief Executive John Chambers said at the company’s annual analyst day in New York, saying the growth will be mostly organic but will include some acquisitions. Chambers is banking on Cisco’s expertise in networking, which he says enables developments such as cloud computing, data centers and applications and eventually the concept of the “Internet of things,” which foresees the connection of everything from traffic lights to medical devices to the power grid. Chambers and Cisco’s chief financial officer, Frank Calderoni, reiterated the company’s target of 5-7 percent compound annual revenue growth in three to five years. Revenue was $46.1 billion in 2012. ZK Research analyst Zeus Kerravala said Cisco has a “good shot” at becoming a broad IT company, but it hardly offered any surprises, especially in light of the revenue outlook. “I think it makes them a boring company because the number is easily achievable, but in this macro it’s better than what HP or Dell are putting their shareholders through,” he said, referring to HP’s accounting scandal and Dell’s struggles with a declining PC market. “The big question for Cisco shareholders is can they keep their margins,” Kerravala said, but added that “the threat of margins has been out there for several years and they have always managed to weather the storm.” Cisco said its operating margin will remain in the high 20s. In 2012 was 28 percent. Shares of Cisco were down 1.1 percent at $19.27 near midday. Calderoni said he expects Cisco’s cloud and unified data center business to post 20-26 percent compound annual growth in that time frame. In 2012 revenue was $1 billion. In mobility he said the compound growth rate will be 14-17 percent. The business in 2012 had revenue of $3 billion. “Our wireless growth has been significant,” Calderoni said, adding that Cisco had benefited from the growing demand for WiFi and small cells that help offload traffic from networks. In security, Calderoni said, the growth rate will be 5-7 percent in three to five years. Cisco, which has seen rivals take market share in the security business, generated $1 billion in revenue in that division in 2012. On growth in emerging markets, Chambers said the company has done well in the top five emerging markets but has work to do in others. “The challenge was the No. 6 through 20,” Chambers said. Its emerging markets business generated $9 billion revenue in 2012. In three to five years that will grow at a 7-13 percent compound annual rate, Calderoni said. Lastly, Calderoni said, Cisco is aiming for 6-9 percent compound annual growth rate in its video business, which generated $8 billion this year.

262,CSCO,REFILE-DEALTALK-Cisco eager to regain ground as network security leader,"* Cisco keen to buy network security company - sources * Tried Palo Alto Networks, could not agree value - sources * Only a few good acquisition targets available By Nicola Leske and Nadia Damouni NEW YORK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - After failing to land a big acquisition in the security space last year and suffering a steady decline in market share, Cisco Systems Chief Executive John Chambers is determined to turn around his company’s lagging security business - whatever the cost. The growing expectation, from Silicon Valley to Wall Street, is that Chambers will not be able to do it with its SecureX product range, and needs to go back to the deal table to boost the business with an acquisition in the coming months. In December, Chambers said he had granted Chris Young - Cisco’s first executive for security at a senior vice president level - a “blank check” for the next two to three years to hire and acquire as he sees fit to overhaul Cisco’s security business and spark a rebound. Cisco has lost around 10 percent of its market share in network security over the past five years to smaller, more innovative rivals such as Juniper Networks Inc, Checkpoint Systems Inc, and Palo Alto Networks Inc . The network equipment company fell behind in web applications, social media and video streaming that call for more complex security protection than traditional firewalls provide. Mike Rothman, analyst and president at security research and advisory firm Securosis, said Cisco was “years behind in terms of a lot of capabilities” and that Young “better get his M&A; people in order”. Cisco is aware of the deficiency and has been actively looking for acquisitions to beef up its network security offerings for some time, three sources familiar with the matter said. However, there are only a handful of top picks - such as Palo Alto Networks, FireEye, Sourcefire, Fortinet  and Barracuda Networks - and Cisco already struck out with at least one before Chambers’ “blank check” strategy. Cisco tried snapping up Palo Alto Networks before the company went public in July 2012, but they could not agree on a deal valuation, two of the sources said. “They tried and they were billions of dollars apart on value,” one of the sources said. The skyrocketing valuations of startups such as Palo Alto Networks or human resources software provider Workday  have been out of reach for large tech companies looking to buy over the past 12 months. Cisco and Palo Alto Networks declined to comment. Cisco has a track record of acquiring companies - almost 160 since 1993 - to grow its businesses, most recently in software, video and wireless. Its last security purchase however dates back to 2009, when it acquired ScanSafe.  But finding an affordable target now is easier said than done because good assets come with a large price tag. “Palo Alto Networks and FireEye are the big prizes and it is hard to justify 7-, 8-, 9-times revenues to your shareholders,” the second person said. Palo Alto Networks, for example, now has a market capitalization of $3.46 billion. And FireEye’s new CEO, industry veteran David DeWalt, is considering an initial public offering this year. Rothman pointed out that SonicWall would also have been a target for Cisco but it was bought by Dell last year. One of the sources said Cisco would also be looking at Fortinet and privately held Barracuda Networks. Sourcefire and Fortinet declined to comment. Barracuda Networks was not immediately available for comment. Cisco’s security troubles stem from its failure to keep up with new ways of hacking that target web applications, said Jonathan Ho, an analyst at William Blair. Instead of adapting, Cisco was “resting on laurels” with legacy products in a rapidly changing market, Ho said. Chambers, asked about the company’s security offerings, has said that Cisco has the products needed to provide corporations with security for their networks, data centers and mobile devices. Security technologies help protect Cisco routers, switches, servers and other equipment and add to Cisco’s strategy of being a one stop shop for corporate IT needs. SecureX - introduced in February 2011 - will allow firewalls, switches, routers and other products to provide protection based on users identity as well as applications and devices, Cisco has said. Frank Calderoni, Cisco’s Chief Financial Officer, promised shareholders in December that the networking company would achieve a compound annual growth rate in security of 5 to 7 percent in three to five years. “Security is a perennial gold mine opportunity in the tech market,” said Frank Gens, senior analyst at research firm IDC, who added that the opportunity was growing due to increasing usage of mobile devices and hackers developing ever more sophisticated skills.

263,CSCO,Cisco eager to regain ground as network security leader,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - After failing to land a big acquisition in the security space last year and suffering a steady decline in market share, Cisco Systems Chief Executive John Chambers is determined to turn around his company’s lagging security business - whatever the cost. The growing expectation, from Silicon Valley to Wall Street, is that Chambers will not be able to do it with its SecureX product range, and needs to go back to the deal table to boost the business with an acquisition in the coming months. In December, Chambers said he had granted Chris Young - Cisco’s first executive for security at a senior vice president level - a “blank check” for the next two to three years to hire and acquire as he sees fit to overhaul Cisco’s security business and spark a rebound. Cisco has lost around 10 percent of its market share in network security over the past five years to smaller, more innovative rivals such as Juniper Networks Inc, Checkpoint Systems Inc, and Palo Alto Networks Inc. The network equipment company fell behind in web applications, social media and video streaming that call for more complex security protection than traditional firewalls provide. Mike Rothman, analyst and president at security research and advisory firm Securosis, said Cisco was “years behind in terms of a lot of capabilities” and that Young “better get his M&A; people in order”. Cisco is aware of the deficiency and has been actively looking for acquisitions to beef up its network security offerings for some time, three sources familiar with the matter said. However, there are only a handful of top picks - such as Palo Alto Networks, FireEye, Sourcefire, Fortinet and Barracuda Networks - and Cisco already struck out with at least one before Chambers’ “blank check” strategy. Cisco tried snapping up Palo Alto Networks before the company went public in July 2012, but they could not agree on a deal valuation, two of the sources said. “They tried and they were billions of dollars apart on value,” one of the sources said. The skyrocketing valuations of startups such as Palo Alto Networks or human resources software provider Workday have been out of reach for large tech companies looking to buy over the past 12 months. Cisco and Palo Alto Networks declined to comment. Cisco has a track record of acquiring companies - almost 160 since 1993 - to grow its businesses, most recently in software, video and wireless. Its last security purchase however dates back to 2009, when it acquired ScanSafe. But finding an affordable target now is easier said than done because good assets come with a large price tag. “Palo Alto Networks and FireEye are the big prizes and it is hard to justify 7-, 8-, 9-times revenues to your shareholders,” the second person said. Palo Alto Networks, for example, now has a market capitalization of $3.46 billion. And FireEye’s new CEO, industry veteran David DeWalt, is considering an initial public offering this year. Rothman pointed out that SonicWall would also have been a target for Cisco but it was bought by Dell last year. One of the sources said Cisco would also be looking at Fortinet and privately held Barracuda Networks. Sourcefire and Fortinet declined to comment. Barracuda Networks was not immediately available for comment. Cisco’s security troubles stem from its failure to keep up with new ways of hacking that target web applications, said Jonathan Ho, an analyst at William Blair. Instead of adapting, Cisco was “resting on laurels” with legacy products in a rapidly changing market, Ho said. Chambers, asked about the company’s security offerings, has said that Cisco has the products needed to provide corporations with security for their networks, data centers and mobile devices. Security technologies help protect Cisco routers, switches, servers and other equipment and add to Cisco’s strategy of being a one stop shop for corporate IT needs. SecureX - introduced in February 2011 - will allow firewalls, switches, routers and other products to provide protection based on users identity as well as applications and devices, Cisco has said. Frank Calderoni, Cisco’s Chief Financial Officer, promised shareholders in December that the networking company would achieve a compound annual growth rate in security of 5 to 7 percent in three to five years. “Security is a perennial gold mine opportunity in the tech market,” said Frank Gens, senior analyst at research firm IDC, who added that the opportunity was growing due to increasing usage of mobile devices and hackers developing ever more sophisticated skills. According to IDC spending on tech security will translate into 7.8 percent revenue growth for vendors this year. But some analysts have been critical of Cisco arguing it has had no specific SecureX products to show and suggested they are merely bundling existing security products under a new name. Jefferies analyst Aaron Schwartz said Cisco’s SecureX strategy would take years to build out to deliver what Cisco promised it could do, and would likely require additional acquisitions.

269,CSCO,Cisco sells home networking business to Belkin,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc is selling its home networking business to Belkin, the networking giant’s latest move to exit the consumer business. The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the deal, which Belkin said on Thursday is expected to close in March. With the sale, Cisco sheds one of the last remaining pieces of its consumer business, following the shutdown of the Flip video camera business in 2011. Earlier this month, Cisco said it would shutter its Umi online video-conferencing service. “Their direct consumer business had all but gone away. This was the next shoe to fall,” said ZK Research analyst Zeus Kerravala. “They made a commitment to investors that they were going to focus on their core areas,” said Kerravala, who noted that the profit margins for the home networking business were lower than those for Cisco’s other businesses. The deal comes 10 years after Cisco entered the home networking business with its $500 million stock acquisition of the Linksys Group in March 2003. Belkin, a privately held company that makes smartphone accessories and home networking products, said it would continue to maintain the Linksys brand, and that it would have a roughly 30 percent share of the U.S. home and small business networking market after the deal. Cisco does not break out financial results for the home networking business. The Cisco business unit that includes the home networking business, as well as other networking and “emerging” technology products, had revenue of $220 million in the most recent quarter, down roughly 12 percent year on year.

273,CSCO,"Europe, data caps curb growth of world mobile data traffic - Cisco","Feb 6 (Reuters) - Europe’s economic slowdown and the introduction of caps on mobile data usage have slightly damped growth of mobile data traffic despite more mobile users, devices and machine-to-machine connections, according to Cisco Systems . “The projected 2012 to 2017 global mobile data traffic increase represents a compound annual growth rate of 66 percent,” according to Cisco’s annual visual networking index forecast published on Tuesday. A year ago, Cisco forecast that between 2011 and 2016 the amount of mobile data traffic would grow at a compound annual rate of 78 percent. “It’s been a little slower, in particular, in Western Europe. You can’t underestimate the economic downturn,” said Arielle Sumits, senior manager of marketing at Cisco. In addition, Cisco’s director of service provider marketing, Thomas Barnett, said caps on data usage have had an impact on mobile data traffic as well. “Three years ago the top 1 percent were generating 50 percent of traffic, today that’s only 16 percent,” he said. Carriers began retreating from flat-rate tariffs in an effort to curb unlimited data and ease the strain on overloaded networks. Nevertheless, by 2017 global mobile data traffic will reach an annual run rate of 134 exabytes per year, the study said. An exabyte is a unit of information and 134 million exabytes are equivalent to 30 trillion images sent via Instagram for example or 10 images daily from each person on earth for an entire year. That translates into 11.2 exabytes per month by 2017 compared with 0.9 exabytes per month in 2012. The Middle East and Africa will see the highest growth rate of data traffic with an annual rate of 77 percent, but almost half of the world’s mobile traffic will come from the Asia Pacific region by 2017. Most of the growth will be generated by smartphones, tablets and laptops but machine-to-machine traffic will rise to 5 percent by 2017, while basic handsets will account for the remaining 2 percent of global mobile data traffic. Machine-to-machine connections include anything from GPS systems in cars to medical applications. By 2017 there will by 5.3 million mobile users compared with 4.3 million in 2012 and more than 10 billion mobile-ready devices and connections, Cisco said.

Chambers comments on economic development are generally watched closely because Cisco is considered a sector bellwether due to its global scale and diverse client base. Cisco’s shares lost 2.4 percent in after-hours trading to $20.63. For its fiscal second quarter that ended Jan. 26, Cisco reported revenue rose 5 percent to $12.1 billion versus a year ago. Analysts, on average, were expecting $12.06 billion, as compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Income, excluding items, rose 6.2 percent to $2.7 billion, or 51 cents per share, 3 cents above analysts’ average estimate of 48 cents a share. The company said it expects revenue in its fiscal third quarter, which runs until the end of April, to grow 4 percent to  percent compared with a year ago.

280,CSCO,Startup Embrane wins Peer1 SDN contract over Cisco and Juniper,"(Reuters) - Virtual networking company Embrane has won hosting company Peer1 as a customer for its Heleos product, beating out larger vendors such as Cisco Systems Inc and Juniper Networks Inc. Embrane is one of a number of startups in an emerging and rapidly growing technology segment that has become known as software-defined networking (SDN). SDN products allow businesses to reduce the amount of networking gear in data centers by replacing much of their functionality with software that is centralized in one or more servers. “Juniper and Cisco did not have a viable SDN solution that was truly heterogeneous, truly cross vendor,” said Greg Rusu, general manager of Peer1’s cloud hosting service, Zunicore. Rusu said the company looked at offerings last summer and liked that Embrane’s product was compatible with any underlying hardware. Juniper said the industry and company strategy had evolved significantly since it discussed SDN with Peer1 almost nine months ago. A Cisco spokesman declined to comment, but noted the company had introduced a number of new products earlier this month as part of its SDN architecture. The SDN market is still considered nascent, but is expected to grow to $3.7 billion by 2016 from an estimated $360 million this year, according to research firm IDC. The technology has been in the spotlight ever since VMware Inc bought SDN startup Nicira in August for $1.26 billion. Heleos was unveiled in 2011 and has been used in trials by a number of companies. Peer1, which counts Internet telephony company Vonage and blogging platform Wordpress among its clients, is one of the first large customers to buy the product. IT services company SunGard will be using Heleos as well, Embrane said. Heleos allows users to create virtual appliances such as firewalls in a matter of seconds instead of days or weeks. “Network services can be up and running in less than two minutes and capacity can be scaled up or down in less than a minute,” Embrane Chief Executive Dante Malagrino said. “We provide the kind of agility at the network level that people expect from computing.” Embrane was founded in 2009 by Malagrino and Marco Di Benedetto, who were part of the founding team of Cisco spin-off Andiamo Systems, a maker of network data storage equipment.

Though weakness in Europe has persisted over recent quarters, underwhelming economic growth data from the region and from Japan, which could impact global growth and U.S. corporate profits, may spur profit-taking in U.S. equities. The French and German economies shrank more than expected in the fourth quarter of 2012, and a 0.6 percent contraction in the euro zone was the steepest for the bloc since the first quarter of 2009. Japan’s GDP shrank 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter, crushing expectations of a modest return to growth and adding weight to the new government’s push for radical policy steps to revive growth. The S&P; 500 is up 6.6 percent so far this year, though a dearth of fresh incentives has kept trading thin over the past few sessions. “We’ve had a real absence of news in the marketplace and any bit of information that suggests the recovery is not underway is probably being given more significance that it might have,” said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. He said that following a mild climb on the S&P; 500, traders were “cashing in a little bit.” Shrinking European economies translated to a 5-percent drop in revenue from the region for Cisco Systems, which reported its results Wednesday. The company’s shares fell 1.6 percent in premarket trading. S&P; 500 futures fell 4 points and were below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures fell 62 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 11 points. H.J. Heinz Co shares jumped 20 percent in premarket trading after it said that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway  and 3G Capital will buy the company for $72.50 a share, or $28 billion including debt. American Airlines and US Airways Group said they plan to merge in a deal that will form the world’s biggest air carrier, with an equity valuation of about $11 billion. US Airways shares rose 1.3 percent in premarket trading. Nvidia shares fell 1.5 percent in premarket trading after the chip maker’s revenue outlook missed expectations on Wednesday, pointing to a slowing PC industry and slower production of tablets using its chips. On the other hand, shares of the world’s largest chip gear maker Applied Materials rose Wednesday after the closing bell following a better-than-expected earnings report and outlook.

285,CSCO,UPDATE 3-Cisco results beat Street; CEO sees challenge in Europe,"* Cisco results beat street amid signs of improvement * But CEO says outlook mixed, Europe still a challenge * Shares down 1.7 percent after hours By Nicola Leske Feb 13 (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc’s quarterly results topped Wall Street views on Wednesday amid early signs tech spending was on the mend, but CEO John Chambers warned the picture was mixed and parts of Europe remained challenging. The company’s shares were down 1.7 pct in after hours trading after Cisco reported that revenue growth in Europe - which accounts for a quarter of its business - was down 5 percent. Revenue in the Americas was up 9 percent and was 8.3 percent higher in the Asia-Pacific region. Chambers pointed out that business in Germany and Northern Europe was beginning to give reason for cautious optimism, but Southern Europe remained tough in economic terms. “We are seeing early signs of stabilization in government spending and also in probably a little bit over two thirds of Europe,” CEO John Chambers told analysts on a conference call after the results were announced. “But I want to watch that for at least another quarter before I get really excited about it.” Chambers comments on economic development are generally watched closely because Cisco is considered a sector bellwether due to its global scale and diverse client base. For the current quarter, which runs until the end of April, Cisco expects revenue to grow 4 percent to 6 percent compared with a year ago. It forecast earnings per share, excluding items, in a range of 48 cents to 50 cents, in line with average analyst expectations of 49 cents. JPM Securities analyst Erik Suppiger said revenue was a particular focus for investors. “People are pretty confident about Cisco’s ability to cut costs and maintain gross margins,” Suppiger said. “The metric people don’t have as much confidence in is revenue,” he said. “There was upside to consensus in the second quarter, but it was fairly modest.” Suppiger said Cisco’s stock had been trading higher before the results and investors had been hoping for more comments on recovery. “He certainly said positive things about the federal sector and positive signs in Europe, but there is not a lot of tangible evidence that we have turned the corner,” Suppiger said. For its fiscal second quarter that ended on Jan. 26, Cisco reported that revenue rose 5 percent to $12.1 billion versus a year ago. Analysts, on average, were expecting $12.06 billion, as compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Income, excluding items, rose 6.2 percent to $2.7 billion, or 51 cents per share, 3 cents above analysts’ average estimate of 48 cents a share. Chief Financial Officer Frank Calderoni said demand for equipment to enable data centers and cloud computing were the main drivers in Cisco’s results, as well as demand for infrastructure for wireless networks, mobility and service provider video. Cisco’s core business is routers and switches, which direct Internet traffic, but the company has begun to focus on data centers, enabling and providing cloud computing technology and video platforms, as well in its goal to become the No. 1 Information Technology company. Its data center business showed 65 percent growth compared with the previous year, while its wireless business and service provider video offerings grew 27 percent and 20 percent, respectively. “They did say they got a benefit from taxes,” Shaw Wu, an analyst at Sterne Agee, said of the second quarter result. “When you (take) that out, it’s 50 cents. That still beat by 2 cents.”",2142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/cisco-results/update-3-cisco-results-beat-street-ceo-sees-challenge-in-europe-idUSL1N0BDICN20130214
286,CSCO,Anti-patent troll bill faces questions in U.S. hearing,"WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - Lawmakers asked on Thursday whether a bill aimed at stopping abusive patent litigation that costs companies millions of dollars each year could end up hurting legitimate companies whose inventions have been infringed. Cisco Systems Inc, Apple Inc, Google Inc  and other tech powerhouses have been pushing for legislation that would reduce the number of times each year that they are sued for infringement by a “non-practicing entity,” a company that licenses patents as its business. Representative Peter DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat, introduced legislation last month aimed at hurting what critics call “patent trolls” by allowing judges to force such firms to pay the legal fees of companies they unsuccessfully sue. One supporter of that bill is Cisco, which pays $50 million a year to fight 50 lawsuits filed by companies that do not make or sell anything, testified Mark Chandler, general counsel for Cisco Systems. Cisco has been further aggravated by lawsuits filed against non-tech companies, like coffee shops, which bought and installed Cisco’s Wi-Fi routers. However, the prospect of a bill that required the non-practicing entity to pay legal bills if they lose an infringement lawsuit worried several lawmakers, including Representative John Conyers, a Michigan Democrat. “We have a measure before us that the plaintiff pays and the defendant who might be an alleged patent infringer pays nothing. This is disturbing,” he said. “To the extent the bill was designed to protect against meritless claims of patent infringement I suspect that the tools to deal with this already exist,” he said. DeFazio’s legislation allows a judge to decide whether the non-practicing entity should bear the defendant’s costs if the defendant wins. Plaintiffs would automatically be exempted if the original inventor was on the complaint, if the company filing the complaint used it or if a university filed the lawsuit. Non-practicing entities sued 5,570 defendants in 2011, twice as many as in 2009, Chandler said, citing RPX Research Patent Litigation Data. Unlike previous years when patent lawsuits focused almost exclusively on manufacturers, retailers, restaurants and other companies that have websites or provide Wi-Fi have been hit, including department store operator JC Penney Co. The chain’s General Counsel Janet Dhillon said that it faced no patent cases four years ago but had since been accused of infringing patents that cover drop-down menus on a website, activating a gift card, Web browsing on a mobile phones and putting a purchase in an electronic shopping cart, among others. “The cost to defend these suits is why we have to settle so many,” she said. The result is that patent litigation now accounts for about half of the chain’s total litigation, and JC Penney is now reluctant to buy technology from smaller companies that could not defend it if an infringement lawsuit were filed, she said.",3142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/patent-congress/anti-patent-troll-bill-faces-questions-in-u-s-hearing-idUSL1N0C65IG20130314

The jury also found that Cisco violated two XpertUniverse patents, and awarded an additional $34,000 in damages on those claims. Cisco, the world’s largest manufacturer of networking equipment, said it would appeal if the judge leaves the jury verdict intact. “We are surprised and extremely disappointed with the jury’s verdict,” Cisco said in an emailed statement after the verdict was delivered in a Delaware federal court. XpertUniverse claimed in the lawsuit that San Jose, California-based Cisco’s “Expert on Demand” software platform was based on software that XpertUniverse developed. XpertUniverse said Cisco violated a non-disclosure agreement it had signed and filed for patents on technology developed by XpertUniverse. It said the companies had entered a relationship in which Cisco would distribute technology XpertUniverse had developed to efficiently match customers with call center experts. XpertUniverse said that the companies signed the non-disclosure agreement before it showed Cisco “every aspect of its intellectual property.” Cisco approached XpertUniverse in 2004 and the companies worked together until 2007, when Cisco severed the relationship, XpertUniverse said in its lawsuit. The next year, Cisco announced it was launching “Expert on Demand.” XpertUniverse filed its lawsuit in 2009. In a court filing this week, Cisco told U.S. District Judge Richard Andrews in Wilmington that “no evidence exists from which the jury could find in favor of XU on either its fraudulent concealment or patent claims.” XpertUniverse attorney Charles Cantine of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP said the company was “obviously very happy” with the verdict.

291,CSCO,"Cisco, IBM and others team up on new technology project","April 8 (Reuters) - Cisco Systems, IBM and Citrix have joined forces with other tech companies in a consortium to kickstart the corporate market for software-defined networking (SDN), aimed at making network management easier and cheaper. Other members of the development platform called OpenDaylight include Juniper Networks, VMware, Microsoft, Red Hat, Intel and Brocade  as well as privately held Big Switch Networks and Arista Networks. Each member will contribute technology such as code to the project in an effort to share the costs of basic research and development, and enable products from different vendors to work together, the companies said on Monday. However, vendors will still be able to customize their offerings to differentiate themselves from rivals. The SDN market is still considered nascent, but is expected to grow to $3.7 billion by 2016 from an estimated $360 million this year, according to research firm IDC. The first code from OpenDaylight is expected to be released in the third quarter of this year. “It will be interesting to see how it works in practice. There was some skepticism on our part on the networking industry getting together because they never got together before,” said Brad Casemore, a veteran networking analyst at IDC, in Toronto. SDN products let businesses reduce the amount of networking gear in data centers by replacing much of their function with software that is centralized in one or more servers. The technology has been in the spotlight ever since VMware bought SDN startup Nicira in August last year for $1.26 billion.

293,CSCO,"Cisco profit beats Street, shares rise on outlook","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc posted a higher than expected quarterly profit and said current-quarter revenue could increase, giving some relief to investors who had worried it was being hurt by weak technology spending. Cisco shares rose about 8 percent after Chief Executive John Chambers said the company was seeing some good signs in the United States and that other parts of the world are “encouraging.” “We are managing the business to account for a continued slow steady recovery on a global basis,” Chambers said. Chambers’ commentary is closely watched by investors as Cisco is seen as a strong indicator for the general health of the technology industry because of its broad customer base. Cisco forecast current-quarter earnings per share of 50 to 52 cents, excluding unusual items, in line with Wall Street expectations. It said revenue would grow in a range of 4 to 7 percent from the year-ago quarter. This implies revenue of about $12.16 billion to $12.5 billion, compared with analysts’ expectations for $12.47 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. RBC Capital analyst Mark Sue said the outlook was much better than expected since several Cisco rivals had much lower forecasts for the current quarter. “All things considered the guidance was actually decent. The commentary was encouraging considering the mixed environment we’re in,” Sue said. Recent signs of weakness from companies including Juniper Networks and International Business Machines Corp made investors worry that Cisco would follow suit, due to sluggish spending by customers such as the U.S. government. “They seem to be bucking the trend and that’s encouraging, said Sue. While Chambers said revenue from the U.S. federal government was down 3 percent in the quarter due to spending cutbacks, this was offset by increased state and local government spending which boosted overall U.S. public sector revenue by 5 percent. About 20 percent of Cisco’s revenue comes from public sector clients around the world, Chief Financial Officer Frank Calderoni said in an interview. Calderoni said Cisco is seeing “a slow and steady recovery” in its global business with signs of economic strength in places such as the United States and weakness in areas including Southern Europe and some Asian countries. “We had a stronger performance in two areas: the Americas, with primary good performance in the United States, and the emerging countries around the world,” he said. Profit for the fiscal third quarter ended on April 27 grew to $2.5 billion, or 46 cents per share, from $2.17 billion, or 40 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Excluding unusual items, earnings per share came in at 51 cents compared with Wall Street expectations for 49 cents according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose more than 5 percent to $12.2 billion from $11.6 billion and compared with Wall Street expectations for $12.18 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Mark McKechnie, an analyst at Evercore was impressed with Cisco’s gross margin of 63 percent, above the company’s target of 61 to 62 percent. “It will be interesting to see if they can raise the guidance on margins, McKechnie said. Cisco forecast fourth-quarter gross margins of 61 to 62 percent, matching the prior quarter’s estimate. Cisco shares rose to $23 in extended trading after closing at $21.21 on Nasdaq.

Cisco forecast current-quarter earnings per share of 50 to 52 cents, excluding unusual items, in line with Wall Street expectations. It said revenue would grow in a range of 4 to 7 percent from the year-ago quarter. This implies revenue of about $12.16 billion to $12.5 billion, compared with analysts’ expectations for $12.47 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. RBC Capital analyst Mark Sue said the outlook was much better than expected since several Cisco rivals had much lower forecasts for the current quarter. “All things considered the guidance was actually decent. The commentary was encouraging considering the mixed environment we’re in,” Sue said. Recent signs of weakness from companies including Juniper Networks and International Business Machines Corp  made investors worry that Cisco would follow suit, due to sluggish spending by customers such as the U.S. government. “They seem to be bucking the trend and that’s encouraging, said Sue. While Chambers said revenue from the U.S. federal government was down 3 percent in the quarter due to spending cutbacks, this was offset by increased state and local government spending which boosted overall U.S. public sector revenue by 5 percent. About 20 percent of Cisco’s revenue comes from public sector clients around the world, Chief Financial Officer Frank Calderoni said in an interview. Calderoni said Cisco is seeing “a slow and steady recovery” in its global business with signs of economic strength in places such as the United States and weakness in areas including Southern Europe and some Asian countries. “We had a stronger performance in two areas: the Americas, with primary good performance in the United States, and the emerging countries around the world,” he said. Profit for the fiscal third quarter ended on April 27 grew to $2.5 billion, or 46 cents per share, from $2.17 billion, or 40 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Excluding unusual items, earnings per share came in at 51 cents compared with Wall Street expectations for 49 cents according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose more than 5 percent to $12.2 billion from $11.6 billion and compared with Wall Street expectations for $12.18 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Mark McKechnie, an analyst at Evercore was impressed with Cisco’s gross margin of 63 percent, above the company’s target of 61 to 62 percent. “It will be interesting to see if they can raise the guidance on margins, McKechnie said. Cisco forecast fourth-quarter gross margins of 61 to 62 percent, matching the prior quarter’s estimate. Cisco shares rose to $23 in extended trading after closing at $21.21 on Nasdaq.

297,CSCO,Aruba Networks sees weak fourth quarter as Cisco competition intensifies,"(Reuters) - Network equipment maker Aruba Networks Inc ARUN.O forecast fourth-quarter results well below Wall Street expectations hurt by rising competition from Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), sending its shares down 17 percent after the bell. Aruba expects fourth-quarter adjusted profit of 10 cents to 12 cents per share, on revenue of $148 million to $150 million. Analysts were looking for adjusted earnings of 17 cents per share, on revenue of $157.1 million. “As the macro environment remains uncertain, we expect to see a heightened level of competition and bundling strategy from our largest competitor,” Chief Executive Dominic Orr said on a post-earnings call with analysts. He said the competition resulted in a lot of deals “slipping out” of April. Aruba will find it difficult to compete with the much larger Cisco’s bundling of its wireless offering with multiple other products such as routers and data centers, Mizuho Securities USA analyst Joanna Makris said. “Cisco is getting more aggressive, and ... that’s causing discounting pressure,” Makris told Reuters. The analyst said she believes this was not just a one-quarter problem, but a longer-term issue. Cisco posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, and said current-quarter revenue could increase, giving some relief to investors who had worried it was being hurt by weak technology spending. Aruba also reported a net loss of $20.2 million, or 18 cents per share, for its third quarter ended April 30, compared with a profit of $6 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 11 cents per share. Revenue rose about 12 pct to $147.1 million. Analysts on average had expected adjusted earnings of 12 cents per share, on revenue of $145.4 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Aruba shares, which have fallen more than 20 percent over the last three months, were trading down 17 percent in after-hours trading. They closed at $17.61 on the Nasdaq.

299,CSCO,Cisco challenges Microsoft buy of Skype in EU court,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc, the world’s leading network equipment maker, will try to convince Europe’s second highest court on Wednesday that it should overturn the EU’s approval of Microsoft’s purchase of Skype. If Cisco wins the challenge at the Luxembourg-based general court, the European Commission would have to annul its decision, which allowed Microsoft to buy the Internet video and voice company without having to make any concessions. Cisco, which is appealing together with Italian fixed-line and Internet telephone provider Messagenet SpA, will argue that the Commission made several “manifest errors” in assessing the $8.5 billion Microsoft-Skype deal. It is expected to argue that the combined company’s dominant share in the communications market gave it the ability and the incentive to refuse to provide data that would allow rivals to work with the merged firm’s products. The last time a company successfully challenged a Commission merger-approval decision at the court was in 2002 in a case involving the Sony Music and BMG record labels. In the vast majority of cases, the court rules with the Commission. A decision by the EU’s general court can be appealed to the European Court of Justice, the EU’s highest court. Cisco’s challenge is one of four court cases against the European Commission’s rulings in merger cases. Deutsche Boerse last year filed an appeal against the Commission’s rejection of its merger with NYSE Euronext while UPS has take action against a regulatory veto of its proposed TNT buy. Ryanair has similarly said it will fight the Commission’s veto of its plan to buy Aer Lingus.

300,CSCO,"COLUMN - Tech, prosperity and peace on West Bank","By David Rohde RAMALLAH, West Bank, May 31 (Reuters) - At first glance, it is a tech utopian’s dream. For the last two years, several dozen Palestinian entrepreneurs have been getting training from Israeli high tech experts courtesy of the American firm Cisco Systems. The sessions feature no talk of politics. Instead, Israelis coach Palestinians on the latest trends in software development processes, best practices and branding. “From my own perspective, it was a very successful training,” said Saeed Zeidan, chief executive officer of a small Palestinian startup. “We managed to improve our services.” The training sessions are an example of privately funded economic initiatives that President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have praised in recent trips here. In his March visit , Obama lauded Cisco’s efforts. In a landmark speech in Washington last week, where he tried to redefine the “war on terror,” Obama said it was vital for the United States to help countries in the region “modernize economies, upgrade education and encourage entrepreneurship.” Three days later, Kerry unveiled a plan to create $4 billion in private-sector investment in the West Bank and Gaza, the largest economic initiative in the Palestinian territories since the 1993 Oslo accords. He called it a “new model” for economic development in the region. “We need to partner with the private sector,” Kerry said, “because it is clear that most governments don’t have the money. And in certain places the private sector actually has a greater ability to move things faster than government does.” Cisco’s efforts began five years ago. Encouraged by U.S. and Palestinian officials, the company’s CEO, John Chambers, visited Ramallah in 2008. Since then, Cisco has invested $15 million in Palestinian tech startups and training programs. “It opened the door for Palestinian software companies to do business with international corporations,” said Gai Hetzroni, an Israeli Cisco executive who manages the program. Dozens of other Israel-based companies have followed Cisco’s example and hired Palestinian firms for outsourcing work. Palestinian firms now also work for Hewlett-Packard, Alcatel-Lucent and other American and European tech giants. Today, 250 Palestinian information and technology companies produce 6.1 percent of Palestinian economic activity, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz recently reported. PalTel, a large Palestinian telecommunications company, skews the figures, but the tech sector is now larger than the historically dominant agricultural sector. Ali Taha, another Palestinian participant in the program, said receiving Cisco training helped to boost Palestinian firms’ reputation in the tech world - as it has for his own company, Art Technologies. Taha  said one potential overseas customer was shocked to hear that such business existed on the West Bank. “When someone told them there is a company that can do this, they said, ‘Is there Internet in Palestine?’ “ Taha recalled, laughing. “They could not believe we could do it.” In his speech Sunday, Kerry said, “Foreign direct investment - private investment, leveraged investment, visionary investment - has the ability to be able to change the world.” Success in Palestinian territories, he argued, could serve as an example for countries across the region. Researchers working with Quarter representative Tony Blair and international business leaders have identified “stunning” opportunities for private investment in tourism, light manufacturing and construction, Kerry said. Home building alone, he estimated, could mean jobs for 100,000 Palestinians. “These experts,” Kerry said, “believe that we can increase the Palestinian GDP [gross domestic product] by as much as 50 percent over three years  Their most optimistic estimates foresee enough new jobs to cut unemployment by nearly two-thirds - to 8 percent, down from 21 percent today - and to increase the median annual wage along with it, by as much as 40 percent.” This week, however, Kerry’s optimism ran into the realities of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Palestinians’ reactions to his proposal were generally positive, but the history of failed past initiatives loomed large. Many Palestinians - including participants in Cisco’s program - cautioned that economic investment was not a substitute for the creation of a Palestinian state. They have been complaining for years that Israeli restrictions on the movement of people and goods in the West Bank strangle the local economy. Taha, the Palestinian entrepreneur, recalled that foreign economic investment had poured into the West Bank after the 1993 Oslo accords. But the Western high-tech company that employed him in Ramallah closed its office here after a 2001 Israeli military incursion. () “Investment and economy cannot survive together with unstable political situations,” Taha said. “Economic investments are a waste of money and effort if they are not executed in parallel with a politically permanent solution.” Kerry’s economic proposals are positive. Corporations that now have record profits and unprecedented global reach are being asked to make a contribution. They can and should do so. To Kerry’s credit, he has repeatedly stated that his economic initiative is no substitute for a political settlement. His effort is laudable. But he faces a long road ahead. Palestinians remain eager to unilaterally seek official recognition at the United Nations. Israelis, meanwhile, are increasingly focused on their own domestic issues, not peace with the Palestinians. Economic proposals involving private companies involve little political risk. Reaching a peace settlement, however, means Israeli, Palestinian and American officials must take enormous risks. Peace is not possible in the Middle East on the political cheap. ",6012013,http://www.reuters.com/article/rohde-westbank/column-tech-prosperity-and-peace-on-west-bank-idUSL2N0EC25E20130601

But TiVo shares fell 20 percent in premarket trading as the settlement disappointed shareholders expecting a bigger payout. The shares rose 8 percent on Thursday after Motorola Mobility said it reached an out-of-court settlement with TiVo. Motorola did not disclose details of the agreement. Motorola had accused TiVo in February 2011 of infringing its patents for digital video recorders. TiVo filed a counterclaim in March last year. TiVo will enter into patent licensing arrangements with Arris Group Inc, Cisco and Google as part of the settlement, TiVo said. TiVo, which will recognize a portion of the payment as past damages during the current quarter and the remainder over time, said all pending litigation would be dismissed. The company also said it would double its stock buyback plan to $200 million and extend it for two years until Aug. 29, 2015. The patent trial was scheduled to begin on Monday. TiVo has turned to litigation to generate revenue from licensing fees as it struggles with competition from low-cost rivals. It settled a patent litigation with Verizon Communications Inc for $250.4 million in September.

302,CSCO,Cisco to invest in Israeli venture capital funds,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Cisco Systems will invest $15 million in Israeli venture capital funds as part of a broader plan to expand its operations in Israel and outside the United States, the company said on Wednesday. The investment will be made in funds that support integration of Israelis and Arabs and the development of innovative security technologies. Cisco, which last year bought Israeli pay-TV smartcard maker NDS for $5 billion, also said it would establish a development centre in Israel that will sponsor research on cyber security and analyze security in the financial, health and industrial sectors. Cisco is building a network of consulting services to assist and provide answers to security needs, and is recruiting 100 strategic workers in Israel. It already has 2,000 employees in Israel. “No country has start-ups like Israel does and I go where the start-ups are,” Chief Executive John Chambers told a news conference during a trip to Israel. Israel “will be the first country in the world to go end-to-end digital,” he said, noting it will be boosted by an ambitious project to build a super-fast fibre optics network. A group led by Sweden’s Viaeuropa was chosen to build the network along with state-run utility Israel Electric Corp using Cisco’s technology. Cisco said the project, which will cost billions of shekels, is expected to be completed in 7-10 years but Chambers said he was pushing for full deployment in 18-36 months. Cisco, he said, is financing $140 million of the project. Global tech spending remains positive, Chamber said, with the United States and most of Europe showing improvement in recent quarters. Emerging markets, particularly India, have turned the corner. “If the U.S. and China don’t lead us out of this slowdown, no matter how effective we are in other parts of the world, you won’t see the global economy coming around,” he said. Chambers, though, said it would continue to invest mostly outside of the United States due to the U.S.’s high taxes.

304,CSCO,S&P; retreats after eight days of gains as Coca-Cola drags,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P; 500 snapped its eight-day winning streak on Tuesday after disappointing sales from Coca-Cola, while investors turned cautious on the day before the Federal Reserve chairman’s congressional testimony. The market’s pullback came a day after both the Dow and the S&P; 500 ended at record closing highs for the third consecutive session. Tuesday’s volume was below average at 5.5 billion shares traded on exchanges, but above Monday’s 4.91 billion, which was the lightest of any full trading day this year. Eight of the 10 S&P; 500 industry sector indexes declined, with materials shares among the day’s worst performers. Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) was the biggest drag in terms of points on the S&P; 500 after the world’s largest soft drinks maker reported weaker-than-expected second-quarter sales, which it blamed on economic malaise and unusually cold and wet weather. The stock, which was the Dow’s biggest percentage loser, fell 1.9 percent to $40.23. “I think you’re going to see a lot of companies that are coming in just barely meeting their earnings expectations and again reporting reduced revenues, and I think that’s the crux of the problem with our economy,” said Brian Amidei, managing director at HighTower Advisors in Palm Desert, California. Investors are eager to hear Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke’s testimony about monetary policy on Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee. His comments will be closely analyzed for signs of when the central bank may start reducing its stimulus efforts. Bernanke’s comments in late May, which raised the prospect of trimming the Fed’s $85 billion in monthly stimulus, triggered a brief selloff and interrupted this year’s rally. The S&P; 500 is still up 17.5 percent since December 31. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI slipped 32.41 points, or 0.21 percent, to end at 15,451.85. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX declined 6.24 points, or 0.37 percent, to finish at 1,676.26. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC fell 8.99 points, or 0.25 percent, to close at 3,598.50. The day’s economic data showed that U.S. consumer prices picked up in June. The overall U.S. Consumer Price Index increased 0.5 percent, the largest gain since February, after inching up 0.1 percent in May. U.S. homebuilder confidence rose in July to its strongest level in 7-1/2 years. Financial stocks, which started the day as outperformers, also dropped despite strong earnings from Goldman Sachs (GS.N). The S&P; financial sector index .SPSY fell 0.4 percent. Goldman Sachs reported quarterly profit doubled as the bank made more money trading bonds before an interest-rate spike hit markets in June. But Goldman’s stock slid 1.7 percent to $160.24 as investors fretted that the results could not be easily repeated. In other earnings reports, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) shares were flat at $90.40 after the Dow component reported higher-than-expected second-quarter earnings. Strong sales of prescription drugs and medical devices more than offset anemic growth of its consumer products, Johnson & Johnson said. Analysts expect S&P; 500 companies’ second-quarter earnings to have grown 3 percent from a year earlier, with revenue up 1.5 percent, data from Thomson Reuters showed. Shares of Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) sank 14.3 percent to $109.05 after Goldman Sachs Group Inc set a new price target far below the stock’s current trading price. After the bell, shares of Yahoo YHOO.O slipped 2.7 percent to $26.15 following the release of its results. In Tuesday’s regular session, Yahoo shares fell 1.7 percent to $26.88. The day’s volume was well below the average daily closing volume for the year of about 6.4 billion shares on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the NYSE MKT. Decliners outpaced advancers on the New York Stock Exchange by a ratio of nearly 2 to 1. On the Nasdaq, about 14 stocks fell for every 11 that rose.

Vivendi said it had entered into exclusive talks to sell its majority stake in Maroc Telecom to Etisalat for 4.2 billion euros ($5.54 billion) in cash. ** Bank holding company PacWest Bancorp said it would buy commercial bank CapitalSource Inc for about $2.29 billion in cash and stock to expand its presence in southern California. ** Cisco Systems Inc said it plans to purchase cybersecurity company Sourcefire Inc for $2.7 billion, a deal that should spark more acquisitions in the industry as large vendors seek to profit from growing demand for IT security. ** Diageo Plc, the world’s biggest spirits group, has taken a controlling stake in China’s white spirits company Shuijingfang, investing further in a key market that has shown signs of slowing. The British group said it had acquired a holding company, which would increase its ownership of the Shanghai-listed firm from 21 percent to 39.7 percent in a deal worth 233 million pounds ($358 million). ** Activist hedge fund Third Point LLC reached an agreement to sell two-thirds of its stake in Yahoo Inc back to the company, pocketing a tidy profit and relinquishing three seats on the board of a company trying to effect a tricky turnaround. ** Burger chain Wendy’s Co said it would sell 425 company-operated  restaurants to franchisees. By the end of 2014, Wendy’s will own 15 percent of its restaurants, down from 22 percent prior to the sales. ** Starbucks Corp and Danone SA said they will sell a co-branded yogurt through Starbucks cafes and in grocery stores as yogurt makers and food companies battle for market share in the $7 billion U.S. market. Financial terms were not disclosed. ** Private Greek business group Copelouzos has offered to team up with Russian Railways to make a bid for Greece’s railway monopoly Trainose in a planned privatization tender, according to a report by Russian news agency Prime. ** Chinese state-controlled firm AVIC is to buy the commercial business of German aircraft engine maker Thielert , banking on a surge in demand for diesel plane engines in China and other emerging markets. AVIC and Thielert, which filed for insolvency more than five years ago, did not provide financial details of the deal. ** Swiss machinery manufacturer Sulzer AG said that it was planning to sell its Sulzer Metco division, mainly active in the automotive and aviation industries, to concentrate on oil and gas, power and water markets, areas where the firm sees more promising growth. ** Ryanair Holdings Plc said it was prepared to sell its stake in rival Aer Lingus Group Plc to appease a UK anti-competition probe, a move analysts said was an apparent gambit to avoid a forced sell-down. Europe’s biggest budget airline said in a statement it would unconditionally sell its 29 percent shareholding to an EU airline that makes an offer to buy out Aer Lingus. ** The sale of Austrian refrigeration manufacturer AHT Cooling, owned by Quadriga Capital, has attracted interest from a clutch of bidders, with private equity firms Bridgepoint and EQT having made it through to the second round, banking sources said. ** A longtime ally of Igor Sechin, Rosneft’s chief executive, may leave the state-controlled company to buy possible oil exploration, production or refining assets by himself, Kommersant daily reported, citing sources. ** Spanish builder Dragados said that it has launched a bid for the remaining 34 percent stake in its Polish subsidiary Pol-Aqua. ** Sweden said that a thorough analysis was needed to decide whether to bring in external ownership to troubled power group Vattenfall’s new central European division. ** DuPont is exploring the sale of its once-lucrative performance chemicals unit, turning its back on the unpredictable paint business to focus on its thriving food and agriculture products. ** The chairman of the world’s second-largest mobile operator Vodafone said the group would seriously consider any offer for its stake in its U.S. joint venture Verizon Wireless but that there was nothing new to announce.

306,CSCO,"Cisco to buy Sourcefire, more network security deals seen","(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc said on Tuesday it plans to purchase cybersecurity company Sourcefire Inc for $2.7 billion, a deal that analysts say should spark more acquisitions in the industry as large vendors seek to profit from growing demand for IT security. Cisco, which has been seeking targets to boost its network security business, said it will pay $76 per share in cash for Sourcefire, a premium of 28.6 percent over its closing price on Monday of $59.08. “We looked broadly at all the major players ... Sourcefire fit perfectly,” Cisco’s business development chief Hilton Romanski said in an interview. Cisco has made it a priority to improve its security and is pushing to offer multiple security capabilities in hardware, software and cloud. Sourcefire is strong in intrusion detection and protection appliances, which is one of the higher growth segments within security. Sourcefire shares rose 27.8 percent to $75.51 in afternoon trading while Cisco stock was down 0.3 percent at $25.64. Analysts said the valuation may be high but the deal made sense for Cisco, which has lost market share in network security to small, innovative rivals such as Juniper Networks Inc, Check Point Software Technologies, and Palo Alto Networks Inc. Cisco wants to be the top player in security and shed its reputation of lagging in that area, company security head Chris Young told analysts on a conference call. “We will not rest until we are the number one security partner for our customers, hands down,” Young said. More acquisitions should be on the way in the tech security sector, which Research firm IDC has said spending this year should generate 7.8 percent revenue growth for vendors. “We view this morning’s news as ‘game changing’ for the cyber security space as we expect a surge of consolidation to take place over the next 12 to 18 months,” Daniel Ives, a tech analyst with FBR Capital Markets, said in a research note. He added that larger technology players such as IBM, Juniper, Symantec, and EMC could look to acquire smaller security players to help drive growth given the high priority security has in IT spending. Brian White, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets, said Dell and Hewlett Packard could also be seeking to expand their security offerings, and the Sourcefire acquisition could be the beginning of more transactions. Potential targets are smaller, more nimble companies that provide up-to-date network security to combat advanced hacking attacks. Security protection needs have grown more complex with the proliferation of web applications, social media and video streaming. Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet as well as privately held FireEye and Barracuda Networks are considered top picks. FBR’s Ives said Fortinet could be worth around $39 a share for example. Fortinet shares rose 5.5 percent to $21.57 in afternoon trading. Cisco said it will integrate Sourcefire, based in Columbia, Maryland, into its security business. Sourcefire founder and Chief Technology Officer Martin Roesch and other top executives will join Cisco’s security group. BMO analyst Tim Long said adding Sourcefire gives Cisco’s business about 20 percent more scale and improves the cloud security offering. “We see this acquisition turning Cisco’s security business from low single-digit growth to mid high-single-digit growth,” Long said. Cisco said the deal should close during the second half of this year, and it expects the acquisition to be slightly dilutive to non-GAAP earnings in fiscal year 2014. Young did not rule out further acquisitions because cyber security threats were constantly changing and adversaries were well-funded. “As the landscape changes we will respond, organically and non-organically,” Young said. Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers said in December that Young had a “blank check” to overhaul the business. RBC Capital Market analyst Mark Sue said in terms of acquisition targets “product, platform, channel integration will be important for Cisco, which has yet to be the customer’s first choice for security”. Centerview Partners advised Cisco on the deal. Sourcefire hired Qatalyst partners, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Penney shares spike on report sales improving in Aug * Cisco’s comment on growth outlook after close hurts tech shares * Indexes: Dow off 0.7 pct; S&P; off 0.5 pct; Nasdaq off 0.4 pct By Angela Moon NEW YORK, Aug 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday, with the Dow industrials posting the worst day since late June, as investors speculated when the Federal Reserve might begin to reduce its ultra-loose monetary policy, which has helped propel stocks to record highs. Trading volume has been low as the earnings season winds down and economic indicators present a mixed view, complicating predictions of the Fed’s next policy action. The Fed has been buying $85 billion in bonds each month to keep interest rates low. Some analysts expect the Fed to start tapering bond purchases as early as September if data shows the economy is improving. Wednesday’s decline accelerated in the final hour of trading after a top Fed official said the U.S. central bank, which meets again in September, should have more evidence about the economy and inflation before it can make a decision. “There is a growing consensus that individual data points  don’t really matter at this point and that the Fed has made up its mind to have completed the bond purchases by the middle of next year,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at  Miller Tabak & Co in New York. Retail stocks were among the day’s top decliners after Macy’s Inc department store reported an unexpected decline in sales and blamed hesitation by consumers to spend on non-essential items. Shares of Macy’s fell 4.5 percent to $46.33. Rival Nordstrom Inc lost 1.1 percent to $59.54. But shares of retailer J.C. Penney Co Inc jumped late in the session on high volume - 37 percent of trading in Penney’s stock came in the last 10 minutes. The stock ended up 3.4 percent at $13.11. The New York Post said on Twitter that same-store sales are positive so far this month, citing sources. Apple was another stand-out as the stock extended gains for a second day, ending up 1.8 percent at $498.50 after topping $500 a share. On Tuesday, investor Carl Icahn, using Twitter, said that he has a large position in Apple.  Hedge fund filings with regulators also showed that Leon Cooperman’s Omega Advisors took a stake in Apple. After the closing bell, shares of Cisco Systems Inc  fell more than 9 percent to $23.97. The network equipment marker said it would cut 4,000 jobs, or 5 percent of its work force.  Chief Executive John Chambers said the company aims to reduce costs and refocus on areas of growth in the face of uncertain demand for its networking equipment. The bleak outlook from Cisco weighed on other tech companies, like competitor Juniper Networks Inc, which fell 4 percent to $20.25 in extended trade. Hewlett-Packard  fell 1.3 percent to $26.83 and Ciena lost 2.1 percent to $22.02. The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 113.35 points, or 0.73 percent, at 15,337.66. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was down 8.77 points, or 0.52 percent, at 1,685.39. The Nasdaq Composite Index  fell 15.17 points, or 0.41 percent, at 3,669.27. The S&P; 500, which has fallen six out of the past eight  sessions, is down about 0.4 percent so far this week but for the year is up 18 percent. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the central bank needs to gather more evidence that the economy is improving and inflation heading higher before deciding to taper its bond buying. In economic news, U.S. producer prices were flat in July, below expectations for a 0.3 percent increase. As the death toll in Egypt worsened, the Market Vectors Egypt Index ETF fell 3.3 percent to $44.61.

Consumer and technology stocks were among the biggest decliners after Wal-Mart Stores’ shares fell on a surprise decline in quarterly same-store sales and Cisco Systems  shares dropped one day after the network equipment maker announced it was cutting 4,000 jobs. “Yes, we are down significantly but this is not a panic sell-off considering how much we have rallied so far this year,”  said J.J. Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. He added that although the CBOE Volatility Index , a gauge of investor anxiety, spiked for the day, the measure was still below 15. Adding to the sell-off, data showed consumer prices rose broadly in July and new claims for jobless benefits last week  fell near a six-year low, factors which could draw the Federal Reserve closer toward trimming its $85 billion monthly bond-buying program to stimulate economic growth. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 225.47 points, or 1.47 percent, at 15,112.19. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was down 24.07 points, or 1.43 percent, at 1,661.32. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was down 63.16 points, or 1.72 percent, at 3,606.12. The CBOE Volatility index VIX rose nearly 12 percent to 14.55. The S&P; 500’s 1.4 percent drop was the biggest since a 2.5 percent fall on June 20. So far this week, the index was down about 1.8 percent. Wal-Mart shares fell 2.6 percent to $74.41 after the world’s largest retailer reported a surprise decline in same-store sales and missed revenue estimates for a fifth consecutive quarter. The company also lowered its revenue and profit forecasts for the year. “The Wal-Mart earnings report is as big a macro indicator as (gross domestic product data),” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group in New York. “It shows that (consumer spending) isn’t that strong yet - inflation is rising, wages are not, unemployment is still pretty high and that’s not a recipe for a strong retail environment.” The technology sector was the biggest laggard on the S&P; 500, heavily weighed down by Cisco, which fell 7.1 percent to $24.51 as brokerages cut price targets on the stock. Shares of smaller rivals Ciena Corp and F5 Networks  were also down. Ciena fell 5.7 percent to $21.22 while F5 Network slipped 3.5 percent to $89.23.

Data showed consumer prices rose broadly in July and new claims for jobless benefits fell to a near six-year low last week, factors which could draw the Fed closer toward trimming its $85-billion monthly bond-buying program. Those stimulus measures have kept interest rates low and buoyed equity markets this year, but on Thursday, U.S. Treasury yields hit two-year highs. Higher rates raise borrowing costs for consumers and companies and reduce the attractiveness of equities relative to higher-yielding bonds. “The speed at which bond yields have increased has caught investors off-guard,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG in New York. Wal-Mart shares fell 2.3 percent to $74.63 after the discount retailer posted disappointing same-store sales and missed revenue estimates for a fifth consecutive quarter.

319,CSCO,"Cisco cutting 4,000 jobs, CEO sees slow progress","(Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc is cutting 4,000 jobs, or 5 percent of its workforce, as it makes a fresh attempt to reduce costs and refocus on growth areas in the face of uncertain demand for its networking equipment. Shares of the world’s biggest network equipment maker fell more than 9 percent after hours, their biggest drop in more than a year if reflected on Nasdaq on Thursday. A lukewarm revenue forecast dashed expectations that Cisco could overcome muted demand for tech infrastructure. Its shares had been up more than 50 percent in the past 12 months. Cisco has been whittling away at its workforce and selling off consumer businesses such as home networking, in a turnaround begun in 2010, when it started losing ground to nimbler rivals like Juniper Networks and Palo Alto Networks. The company that once specialized in providing the backbone of the Internet now sees software and equipment for datacenters and corporate cloud networking as its keys to growth. But Wednesday’s results suggest the pace of expansion has been slower than anticipated, analysts said. “The environment in terms of our business is improving slightly but nowhere near the pace that we want,” said Chief Executive John Chambers on a conference call following quarterly earnings. “We have to very quickly reallocate the resources.” Cisco said last month it plans to buy cyber security company Sourcefire Inc for $2.7 billion. The company has made it a priority to improve security across its hardware, software and cloud products. Chambers also said the current business environment was underperforming his expectations. Despite strength in the United States, weakness in Asia and mixed results from Europe continued to dog its business. The Cisco CEO’s take on the global corporate technology environment is closely watched by investors, as Cisco is regarded a strong indicator of the general health of the technology industry because of its broad customer base. Shares of Microsoft Corp, Oracle Corp, IBM and Hewlett-Packard Co all fell slightly after hours. Cisco forecast 3 percent to 5 percent revenue growth this quarter, toward the low end of expectations, as it continues to grapple with an uncertain global IT spending environment. Executives also forecast on Wednesday earnings-per-share of 50 cents to 51 cents in its fiscal current quarter. Earlier, Cisco reported fiscal fourth-quarter revenue in line with Wall Street expectations. The company’s forecast for current-quarter revenue growth translated into a range of $12.2 billion to $12.5 billion. Analysts on average had expected $12.5 billion. “You had a tough set-up with higher expectations going in,” said Mark McKechnie, an analyst at Evercore, who said last quarter’s relatively strong earnings and financial forecasts had raised optimism among investors. “Chambers’ commentary was a bit more muted; he’s talking about a slower recovery but inconsistency across geographies.” Cisco had a net profit of $2.3 billion, or 42 cents per share, in the fourth quarter. That compared with a profit of $1.9 billion, or 36 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose 6 percent to $12.4 billion, matching analysts’ expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding some items, the company reported profit of 52 cents per share, which was a penny better than analysts’ average estimate.

321,CSCO,"UPDATE 1-Chipmaker Nvidia hires CFO, ends two-year search","SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Nvidia  said on Monday it had appointed a former Cisco and Microsoft executive as its new chief financial officer, ending a search of more than two years after its previous CFO left. Colette Kress, who has worked in the technology industry for 24 years, replaces interim CFO Karen Burns, who stepped in after Nvidia’s previous CFO David White left in May 2011 for personal reasons. The appointment of a new CFO was seen as unlikely to mark any major changes at Nvidia, which is expanding into tablets and smartphones as its core business of selling graphics chips for personal computers faces pressure. “When you have a very strong CEO, as Nvidia does, the strategy and direction very clearly comes from the corner office, so a CFO change is not indicative of an inflection point in the direction of the company,” said RBC Capital analyst Doug Freedman. Nvidia Chief Executive and co-founder Jen-Hsun Huang said in a statement that Kress, who most recently was senior vice president and chief financial officer at Cisco’s Business Technology and Operations Finance organization, would help the company extend into visual computing, mobile and cloud computing. Burns will return to her previous job as Nvidia’s controller, company spokesman Robert Sherbin said in an email. “We were waiting until we found the right fit. In the meantime, our interim CFO was doing a great job, which gave us time to hold off until we found the right individual,” Sherbin said. Shares of Nvidia edged up to $15.83 in extended trade after closing up 0.06 percent at $15.81.",9162013,http://www.reuters.com/article/nvidia-cfo/update-1-chipmaker-nvidia-hires-cfo-ends-two-year-search-idUSL2N0HC1UK20130916

A visitor could check in at a hotel without having to line-up at a front desk by simply signing in via the Facebook application on a smartphone, Cisco said. The company also demonstrated how it might work at a hospital as Chief Executive Officer John Chambers gave a speech at the Interop technology conference in New York. Chambers said retailers could deliver tailored promotions or information to consumers who check in through Facebook when they arrive at a store. Cisco said some customers of its Connected Mobile Experience  Wi-Fi technology are currently testing the system. While Cisco is looking to sell network equipment, Facebook appears to be following arch-rival Google Inc in  collecting data on the shopping and Web browsing habits of  customers so it can offer targeted ads. Earlier this year, Google announced plans to bring free wireless Internet access to 7,000 Starbucks Corp cafes across the United States. As part of their deal, Google will also help develop a version of the Starbucks Digital Network available to customers, putting it in a strong position to offer targeted advertising and promote the music and other media it sells.",10022013,http://www.reuters.com/article/cisco-facebook/cisco-and-facebook-collaborating-to-offer-free-public-wi-fi-idUSL1N0HS14A20131002
325,CSCO,"Exclusive: Cisco, Google, SAP discussing BlackBerry bids - sources","NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd, on the block as its smartphone business struggles, is in talks with Cisco Systems, Google Inc and SAP about selling them all or parts of itself, several sources close to the matter said. Such a deal would be an alternative to the preliminary agreement reached weeks ago with a group, led by BlackBerry’s biggest shareholder, Fairfax Financial Holdings, to take the company private for about $4.7 billion, a bid which has faced some skepticism because of financing questions. The company, based in Waterloo, Ontario, has asked for preliminary expressions of interest from potential strategic buyers, which also include Intel Corp and Asian companies LG and Samsung, by early next week. It is unclear which parties will bid, if any. But the potential technology buyers have been especially interested in BlackBerry’s secure server network and patent portfolio, although doubts about the assets’ value remain an issue, the sources said. Google, Intel, Cisco, LG and SAP declined to comment. Samsung was not immediately available for comment. Possible bidders are proceeding with caution given the uncertainty around BlackBerry, which last month reported a quarterly loss of nearly $1 billion after taking a writedown on unsold Z10 phones. The value of BlackBerry’s patent portfolio and licensing agreements is likely to halve in the next 18 months, a company filing from this week shows, potentially limiting its attractiveness. According to analysts, BlackBerry’s assets include a shrinking yet well-regarded services business that powers its security-focused messaging system, worth $3 billion to $4.5 billion; a collection of patents that could be worth $2 billion to $3 billion; and $3.1 billion in cash and investments. Adding to the company’s woes, it’s likely to burn through almost $2 billion of its cash pile in the next year and a half, Bernstein analyst Pierre Ferragu wrote on Thursday after studying the filing. Private equity firms that have showed interest in BlackBerry - which also include Cerberus Capital Management - have asked the company and its advisers to provide additional financial details about its various business segments, two of the sources said. That process could take another few weeks, as BlackBerry focuses on taking bids from industry peers, the sources said. In August, the company said it was weighing its options, which could include an outright sale, after Reuters first reported BlackBerry’s board was warming up to the possibility of going private. At that time, it formed a five-member special committee chaired by board director Timothy Dattels. Other members include Chairman Barbara Stymiest, Chief Executive Thorsten Heins, Richard Lynch and Bert Nordberg. A spokesman for BlackBerry said in an emailed statement to Reuters: “The special committee, with the assistance of BlackBerry’s independent financial and legal advisors, is conducting a robust and thorough review of strategic alternatives.” He declined to provide further comment. JPMorgan Chase & Co and RBC Capital Markets are advising BlackBerry. The board is being advised by Perella Weinberg Partners, the sources said. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Torys LLP are providing legal advice.

328,CSCO,Exclusive: Motorola looking to exit wireless LAN business - sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Motorola Solutions Inc is exploring the sale of its underperforming wireless LAN business, which has grappled with declining share in a market dominated by rivals such as Cisco Systems Inc, people familiar with the matter said. An exit from the wireless LAN market would come as Motorola, the provider of data communications and telecommunications equipment, seeks to focus on its core government and public safety division. Motorola Solutions, which succeeded Motorola Inc following the spin-off of the mobile phones business into Motorola Mobility in 2011, provides communication services for the U.S. government and other enterprise customers. Motorola Mobility was later sold to Google Inc for $12.5 billion. The wireless local area network unit, which is under Motorola Solutions’ enterprise division, has struggled amid competition from top players including Aruba Networks Inc and Hewlett-Packard Co, as well as smaller players such as Ubiquiti Networks Inc. “It’s a tough market. It’s being squeezed from the top by Cisco and from the bottom by Ubiquiti,” said one of the people familiar with the matter, adding that the talks are at an early stage. The people asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. Motorola declined to comment. The Motorola unit’s revenues declined by a mid-single digit percentage point in the second quarter, following a massive 30 percent decline in the first quarter. The business had $216.7 million in 2012 revenues, roughly 8 percent of the $2.71 billion enterprise business. The global enterprise wireless LAN business is expected to be a $4 billion market for 2013, according to research firm Dell’Oro group. Cisco is the market leader, with nearly 55 percent of the market segment revenue, followed by Aruba at just over 12 percent. The value of Motorola’s wireless LAN business could not be determined. Motorola Solutions, which has a market value of just over $16 billion, dominates the two-way radio market with its land-mobile-radio systems and public-safety products, and the U.S. government is its largest customer. The company’s government business brought in nearly 70 percent of its total revenue last year. The attempt to shed the wireless LAN unit follows other divestitures Motorola Solutions has undertaken since 2011. The company sold its wireless network assets to Nokia Siemens Networks for $975 million in 2011, and later that year sold small broadband networks units to buyout firm Vector Capital for an undisclosed sum. Motorola Solutions cut its revenue forecast in July for the second time in three months because of declines in its enterprise business. Earlier this year, the company’s chief executive said that revenue declines in the wireless LAN business were due to a “failure to execute” rather than market forces, and said the company had not done a “good enough job” selling wireless LAN products as part of its managed service offering, rather than as stand alone products. “We have consistently lost share in WLAN and we just haven’t executed that well. Now it is a little bit more embryonic in terms of our strategic change from product to managed services but we’ve got to do a better job,” Chief Executive Greg Brown told analysts in April. Meanwhile, Motorola Solutions is offering a voluntary buyout program to select employees in North America, or less than 20 percent of the company’s global workforce, a spokesperson for the company said on Friday.

330,CSCO,"Cisco buys out start-up Insieme, unveils its products","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc, looking to protect its core business from new competition, has bought out the remainder of its majority-owned data center technology start-up, Insieme, in a deal that could cost up to $863 million. Cisco, which already owned 85 percent of Insieme, said it closed the deal with its employees, and the final price would be tied to sales targets for which it did not reveal details. It also unveiled Insieme’s first products, which are Cisco’s answer to software defined networking (SDN) technology, a growing trend among its rivals in developing software with features that are typically found in high-end network hardware. Because SDN technology can run on cheaper hardware than Cisco’s expensive routers and switches, the network hardware leader had to find a way to protect its equipment sales. Chief Executive John Chambers, who discussed the products at a New York event, said Cisco’s approach could save customers money and create a multibillion-dollar dollar business. He told customers and technology partners that Insieme products would, “reset the stage for IT for the next decade.” Rivals who have been gaining attention because of SDN include privately held Arista Networks, as well as VMware Inc, which created waves when it bought SDN start-up Nicira in 2012 for just over $1 billion. Juniper Networks Inc and Hewlett-Packard Co are also Cisco competitors in the sector. Insieme was launched in early 2012 with a $100 million investment from Cisco, followed by a $35 million round of funding in November 2012. The start-up, which has 286 employees, was founded and is run by longtime Cisco engineers Prem Jain, Mario Mazzola and Luca Cafiero, and is now the third start-up they have created that has been folded back into Cisco. The products include the Nexus 9000 family of network switches, which is ready to be shipped to customers, and a software controller called the Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC), which will be available for sale in the first half of 2014. The controller was designed to centralize data center management for everything from network, storage and computing equipment to applications and security, and make rolling out new software or making changes to existing applications much easier. JP Morgan analyst Rod Hall said that, while Cisco’s technology looks “solid,” aggressive pricing could, “make it tough for the company to grow earnings in coming years.” RBC analyst Mark Sue said Cisco is trying to “turn the world around by making its system more flexible,” which could be good news for its customers, but bad news for the industry overall. But HP, which sells server computers that run SDN technology, responded to the news by criticizing Cisco’s strategy. Dave Larson, HP’s networking chief technology officer, said Cisco’s offering, “locks customers into a proprietary Cisco network.” Cisco says that, by combining central management with its own hardware, customers could see total cost-of-ownership savings of 75 percent, compared with software-only management systems. Cisco also announced partnerships with key data center technology providers, including Microsoft Corp, IBM Corp and EMC Corp.

Insieme was launched in early 2012 with a $100 million investment from Cisco, followed by a $35 million round of funding in November 2012. The start-up, which has 286 employees, was founded and is run by longtime Cisco engineers Prem Jain, Mario Mazzola and Luca Cafiero, and is now the third start-up they have created that has been folded back into Cisco. The products include the Nexus 9000 family of network switches, which is ready to be shipped to customers, and a software controller called the Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC), which will be available for sale in the first half of 2014. The controller was designed to centralize data center management for everything from network, storage and computing equipment to applications and security, and make rolling out new software or making changes to existing applications much easier. JP Morgan analyst Rod Hall said that, while Cisco’s technology looks “solid,” aggressive pricing could, “make it tough for the company to grow earnings in coming years.” RBC analyst Mark Sue said Cisco is trying to “turn the world around by making its system more flexible,” which could be good news for its customers, but bad news for the industry overall. But HP, which sells server computers that run SDN technology, responded to the news by criticizing Cisco’s strategy. Dave Larson, HP’s networking chief technology officer, said Cisco’s offering, “locks customers into a proprietary Cisco network.” Cisco says that, by combining central management with its own hardware, customers could see total cost-of-ownership savings of 75 percent, compared with software-only management systems.

335,CSCO,Exclusive: Cisco rival Arista Networks picks banks for IPO - sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Arista Networks, a maker of network switches that competes with much bigger rival Cisco Systems Inc, has selected banks to lead a proposed initial public offering for next year, according to people familiar with the matter. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc and Credit Suisse Group will lead the offering that is at an early stage of planning, the people said on Tuesday, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. Representatives for Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Arista, Citigroup and Credit Suisse declined to comment. The Santa Clara-based company could have a valuation of around $2.5 billion, according to some industry analysts who attended a presentation the company made in September. Arista’s 2013 revenue is likely to exceed $300 million, ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall said. Arista is one of several high-profile technology companies gearing up for an IPO, on the heels of a successful debut by Twitter Inc last week, which raised more than $1.8 billion for the microblogging company. Reuters reported on Friday that fast-growing data storage company Box has selected Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Chase & Co to lead a proposed IPO that could raise around $500 million. Arista was started in 2004 by German-born Andy Bechtolsheim and Canadian native David Cheriton, a University of Stanford computer science professor, with $100 million in funding. The company introduced its first products, used in high frequency trading, in 2008. It has also gained traction with new uses for its products such as cloud computing, big data and software defined networking. It partners with major technology companies including VMware Inc, Microsoft Corp, SAP AG as well as Palo Alto Networks Inc, Riverbed Technology Inc, Splunk Inc and F5 Networks Inc. Both Bechtolsheim and Cheriton have a history of launching successful companies, and are known to have a knack for smart investments - they were the initial investors in Google. Bechtolsheim co-founded Sun Microsystems in 1982. It was bought by Oracle in 2010. Cheriton and Bechtolsheim also founded switching technology company Granite Systems, which was acquired by Cisco in 1996. They also started server-technology firm Kealia, which was bought by Sun Microsystems in 2004. Both men worked with Cisco for some years. It was Cisco they looked to when they needed a chief executive for Arista, and they attracted Jayshree Ullal - a 15-year Cisco veteran who was responsible for data center switching and services. All of Arista’s senior management, with the exception of its chief financial officer and its senior vice president of global sales operations, consists of former Cisco employees. Long-time Cisco veterans, Charlie Giancarlo and Dan Scheinman, also sit on the company’s board.

336,CSCO,"Cisco warns of big second quarter revenue drop, shares fall","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc warned that its revenue would decline between 8 percent and 10 percent in its second fiscal quarter, sending its shares down almost 10 percent in late trade. Chief Executive John Chambers blamed weak demand in emerging markets such as China, saying companies there have become more hesitant to buy Cisco products due because of political repercussions from leaks about the United States spying on foreign governments. Chambers said that in other countries, where the political impact was nominal, Cisco is seeing a slowdown in decision making due to macro economic issues there. The executive also cited a big decline in revenue from set-top box sales as the company walked away from less profitable contracts in that market. He said Cisco’s orders fell dramatically toward the end of the first quarter because of big declines in many of its most important emerging market countries. “The last two weeks of the last quarter was really tough,” Chambers told analysts on Cisco’s conference call after the results were released. Cisco also said revenue for the first quarter rose less than expected due to weak demand in emerging markets such as China and the recent U.S. government shutdown’s chilling effect on business spending. Cisco shares fell to $21.60 in late trade after the company released financial targets that analysts said “floored” them. The stock closed at $23.99 on Nasdaq and had already fallen 9 percent since its last quarterly report in August. Cisco said revenue grew only 2 percent to $12.09 billion in its fiscal first quarter ended October 26, from $11.88 billion in the year-ago quarter, below analysts’ average estimate of $12.34 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company itself had forecast growth of 3 percent to 5 percent in the quarter. Chambers told analysts on the company’s conference call that while the partial U.S. federal government shutdown directly cut a smaller than expected $50 million off Cisco’s revenue it also dampened demand from nongovernment customers. Chambers said the shutdown “exasperated the lack of confidence among business leaders we had highlighted over the past few quarters.” Cisco also said its board had authorized up to $15 billion in additional repurchases of its common stock. Cisco’s profit dropped to $2 billion, or 37 cents per share from $2.09 billion, or 39 cents per share. Excluding unusual items the company earned 53 cents per share compared with Wall Street expectations of 51 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

339,CSCO,Juniper appoints Barclays executive Shaygan Kheradpir CEO,"(Reuters) - Network gear maker Juniper Networks Inc named Barclays Plc’s chief operations and technology officer, Shaygan Kheradpir, as successor to Chief Executive Kevin Johnson. Kheradpir joined Barclays in January 2011. Before that, he was executive vice president and chief information and technical officer at Verizon Communications Inc. Analysts said Kheradpir’s appointment indicates Juniper is likely to focus more on software-based networking and services. “We expect Mr. Kheradpir to sharpen Juniper’s focus in Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) given investor skepticism around the company’s strategy in this area,” Wedbush Securities analysts wrote in a note. Some of the world’s biggest technology companies, such as Cisco Systems Inc, Oracle Corp and Microsoft Corp have been investing in SDN, a technology that allows users to substitute some of the most complex hardware functions in server switches with software. Juniper acquired SDN firm Contrail Systems for $176 million in December. NFV separates network functions like caching from hardware appliances so they can run in software. Kheradpir was instrumental in several key initiatives at Verizon such as FiOS, interactive TV, high-speed data and carrier-grade VoIP, UBS analyst Amitabh Passi said. Verizon’s fiber optic service (FiOS) bundles television, Internet and telephony services. Kheradpir will take up his new job on January 1, Juniper said on Wednesday.

343,CSCO,"Spy scandal weighs on U.S. tech firms in China, Cisco takes hit","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S. technology companies including Cisco Systems Inc, International Business Machines Corp and Microsoft Corp may face new challenges selling their goods and services in China as fallout from the U.S. spying scandal starts to take a toll. Cisco shares tumbled 11 percent on Thursday, a day after it warned that revenue could drop as much as 10 percent this quarter, and continue to contract through the middle of next year, in part due to a backlash in China after revelations about U.S. government surveillance programs. “All the big U.S. IT companies are concerned,” said Jim Lewis, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, who is an expert on China and technology. “But so far Cisco is bearing the brunt of it.” Lewis said Beijing may be targeting Cisco in particular as retaliation for Washington’s refusal to buy goods from China’s Huawei Technologies Co, a telecommunications equipment maker that the United States claims is a threat to its national security because of links to the Chinese military. Cisco’s much smaller network equipment rival Juniper Networks said on Thursday that it was not seeing an impact from leaks by former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden about U.S. spying. “The Snowden effect is not real,” Juniper Chief Marketing Officer Brad Brooks said. “Our business continues to grow in Asia Pac as well as China. As we look at that business there we’ve not seen those types of conversations from our customers.” Snowden’s revelations provoked a storm in the Chinese media and added urgency to Beijing’s efforts to use its market power to create indigenous software and hardware, analysts and business executives say. “The U.S. government isn’t doing any favors for Cisco,” said Evercore Partners analyst Mark McKechnie. Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers said on a conference call that Cisco and its peers face “challenging political dynamics” in China. IBM last month reported a 22 percent drop in China revenue, leading to a 4 percent decline in its third-quarter profit. Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge attributed the company’s problems to the “process surrounding China’s development of a broad-based economic reform plan,” which caused delays in purchases. Microsoft executives singled out China as the company’s weakest performing area in the world during the September quarter in an October 24 earnings call. “The macro conditions in China, which I think are consistent with what some of the other companies have reported as well, have been challenging,” said Chris Suh, Microsoft’s general manager for investor relations. Company officials could not be reached for comment. Beijing has long mistrusted foreign technology companies, and those concerns have been exacerbated since Snowden first revealed the existence of the NSA’s clandestine data mining program in June. “This is all about China using its own technology, and China building leading technology companies,” said James McGregor, chairman for Greater China at consultancy APCO Worldwide. Although Beijing has not prohibited state firms from purchasing Western-made technology services and equipment, the government has sent a clear message to choose Chinese-made equipment first, China-based executives say. “While a formal document hasn’t been issued, in the future we will try to buy IT equipment from domestic brands, such as Lenovo,” said a person familiar with technology purchases at one of China’s four big state-owned banks. “The government’s signal is pretty clear - they want to rely less on U.S. products, such as IOE (IBM, Oracle and EMC Corp),” said a former China-based telecommunications executive. Oracle officials could not be reached. Representatives with EMC and IBM declined to comment. In August, the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s top economic planning body, published a statement setting cyber-security standards for financial institutions, cloud computing and big data, information system secrecy management and industrial controls. Four domestic software and hardware makers, including China National Software & Service Co, announced this month they have received a “top-tier” rating from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. China National Software’s share price has gained nearly 250 percent since the Snowden revelations. “We hope and demand that relevant foreign companies respect China’s laws,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said on Thursday, when asked about Cisco’s woes. “At the same time, as the Chinese government we of course have an obligation, a responsibility, to protect the country’s security.” Snowden’s revelations have reverberated in other big emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico and India. Cisco CFO Frank Calderoni said China was where the company was most affected by a political backlash, but noted that it was difficult to quantify how much of its revenue shortfall was due to politics versus macroeconomic trends. To be sure, the impact of any Snowden scandal backlash is unlikely to hit all U.S. tech firms equally. Cisco is perhaps most vulnerable, experts said, because it competes with two well-established Chinese telecommunications equipment providers: Huawei and ZTE. Chinese companies are less competitive in producing semiconductors and database software, which means that any fallout from the scandal will have less impact on U.S. firms in those areas. “Everyone is feeling the heat from the NSA revelations,” said a former employee at a major multinational technology firm. The important point, however, was that companies like IBM don’t have competitors for their high-end equipment, the expert added. “If they don’t buy from IBM they can’t buy from anyone else.” ",11142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-cisco/spy-scandal-weighs-on-u-s-tech-firms-in-china-cisco-takes-hit-idUSBRE9AD0J420131114

Cisco also said on Wednesday that some customers, particularly in China, were hesitating to buy its equipment because of the scandal arising from the leaking of secret U.S. government documents by Edward Snowden, a former contractor at the National Security Agency. “The Snowden effect is not real,” Brooks said. “Our business continues to grow in Asia Pac as well as China. As we look at that business there we’ve not seen those types of conversations from our customers.” ",11142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/juniper-outlook/juniper-4th-qtr-outlook-unchanged-seeing-no-snowden-effect-exec-idUSWEN00BKE20131114

352,CSCO,Cisco shares drop 13 percent after revenue warning,"(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc’s shares fell as much as 13 percent on Thursday after the network equipment maker forecast a steep drop in revenue for the current quarter, prompting at least 17 brokerages to cut price targets on its stock and two to downgrade their ratings. Cisco said on Wednesday it expected an 8-10 percent drop in revenue in the current quarter after lower sales to telecom and cable service providers and in emerging markets hurt its results in the quarter ended October 26. Analysts cut their price targets on Cisco’s stock by as much as $6 to a low of $20. Cisco shares were trading at $21.00 in late morning trading on the Nasdaq. About 140 million shares had traded by 11:13 a.m. ET. Goldman Sachs was among the brokerages that cut its target price, to $25 from $30. Goldman also removed the stock from its Conviction List of top picks, citing “reduced confidence in the near-term trajectory”, but Goldman analysts maintained their “buy” rating. Cisco’s revenue warning comes after former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden exposed widespread surveillance by the National Security Agency through internet data, much of which is transmitted via Cisco’s equipment. Cisco’s chief financial officer, Frank Calderoni, told analysts the company had been affected by a political backlash in China, but said it was difficult to quantify how much of its revenue shortfall was a result of this. In a note titled “An outlook to make even mom look twice”, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Sue said the China issue might linger for a while. Sue cut his price target on the stock to $22 from $24, maintaining a rating of “outperform”. “While our checks noted emerging markets weakness, we were clearly wrong on magnitude of the order weakness,” Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Modoff said in a note. Modoff downgraded Cisco’s stock to “hold” from “buy”, and cut his price target to $25 from $28. Analysts said Cisco faced stiff competition from companies such as Aruba Networks Inc, Alcatel-Lucent SA, Brocade Communications Systems Inc, Ciena Corp, F5 Networks Inc, Riverbed Technology Inc and Juniper Networks Inc. However, shares of these companies also fell on Thursday, along with those of optical component makers JDS Uniphase Corp and Finisar Corp, which supply Cisco. Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha said Cisco looked increasingly vulnerable to technological innovations and competitive pressures. Garcha cut his price target to $20.

353,CSCO,"Spy scandal weighs on U.S. tech firms in China, Cisco takes hit","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S. technology companies including Cisco Systems Inc, International Business Machines Corp and Microsoft Corp may face new challenges selling their goods and services in China as fallout from the U.S. spying scandal starts to take a toll. Cisco shares tumbled 11 percent on Thursday, a day after it warned that revenue could drop as much as 10 percent this quarter, and continue to contract through the middle of next year, in part due to a backlash in China after revelations about U.S. government surveillance programs. “All the big U.S. IT companies are concerned,” said Jim Lewis, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, who is an expert on China and technology. “But so far Cisco is bearing the brunt of it.” Lewis said Beijing may be targeting Cisco in particular as retaliation for Washington’s refusal to buy goods from China’s Huawei Technologies Co, a telecommunications equipment maker that the United States claims is a threat to its national security because of links to the Chinese military. Cisco’s much smaller network equipment rival Juniper Networks said on Thursday that it was not seeing an impact from leaks by former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden about U.S. spying. “The Snowden effect is not real,” Juniper Chief Marketing Officer Brad Brooks said. “Our business continues to grow in Asia Pac as well as China. As we look at that business there we’ve not seen those types of conversations from our customers.” Snowden’s revelations provoked a storm in the Chinese media and added urgency to Beijing’s efforts to use its market power to create indigenous software and hardware, analysts and business executives say. “The U.S. government isn’t doing any favors for Cisco,” said Evercore Partners analyst Mark McKechnie. Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers said on a conference call that Cisco and its peers face “challenging political dynamics” in China. IBM last month reported a 22 percent drop in China revenue, leading to a 4 percent decline in its third-quarter profit. Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge attributed the company’s problems to the “process surrounding China’s development of a broad-based economic reform plan,” which caused delays in purchases. Microsoft executives singled out China as the company’s weakest performing area in the world during the September quarter in an October 24 earnings call. “The macro conditions in China, which I think are consistent with what some of the other companies have reported as well, have been challenging,” said Chris Suh, Microsoft’s general manager for investor relations. Company officials could not be reached for comment. Beijing has long mistrusted foreign technology companies, and those concerns have been exacerbated since Snowden first revealed the existence of the NSA’s clandestine data mining program in June. “This is all about China using its own technology, and China building leading technology companies,” said James McGregor, chairman for Greater China at consultancy APCO Worldwide. Although Beijing has not prohibited state firms from purchasing Western-made technology services and equipment, the government has sent a clear message to choose Chinese-made equipment first, China-based executives say. “While a formal document hasn’t been issued, in the future we will try to buy IT equipment from domestic brands, such as Lenovo,” said a person familiar with technology purchases at one of China’s four big state-owned banks. “The government’s signal is pretty clear - they want to rely less on U.S. products, such as IOE (IBM, Oracle and EMC Corp),” said a former China-based telecommunications executive. Oracle officials could not be reached. Representatives with EMC and IBM declined to comment. In August, the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s top economic planning body, published a statement setting cyber-security standards for financial institutions, cloud computing and big data, information system secrecy management and industrial controls. Four domestic software and hardware makers, including China National Software & Service Co, announced this month they have received a “top-tier” rating from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. China National Software’s share price has gained nearly 250 percent since the Snowden revelations. “We hope and demand that relevant foreign companies respect China’s laws,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said on Thursday, when asked about Cisco’s woes. “At the same time, as the Chinese government we of course have an obligation, a responsibility, to protect the country’s security.” Snowden’s revelations have reverberated in other big emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico and India. Cisco CFO Frank Calderoni said China was where the company was most affected by a political backlash, but noted that it was difficult to quantify how much of its revenue shortfall was due to politics versus macroeconomic trends. To be sure, the impact of any Snowden scandal backlash is unlikely to hit all U.S. tech firms equally. Cisco is perhaps most vulnerable, experts said, because it competes with two well-established Chinese telecommunications equipment providers: Huawei and ZTE. Chinese companies are less competitive in producing semiconductors and database software, which means that any fallout from the scandal will have less impact on U.S. firms in those areas. “Everyone is feeling the heat from the NSA revelations,” said a former employee at a major multinational technology firm. The important point, however, was that companies like IBM don’t have competitors for their high-end equipment, the expert added. “If they don’t buy from IBM they can’t buy from anyone else.” ",11152013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-cisco/spy-scandal-weighs-on-u-s-tech-firms-in-china-cisco-takes-hit-idUSBRE9AD0J420131115
354,CSCO,"Insight: For Cisco and Huawei, a bruising rivalry reaches stalemate","(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc and Huawei Technologies Co, two of the world’s largest communications equipment makers, have been slugging it out for a decade now - in court, in emerging markets, in the lobbies of government and even on blogs. The past year suggests they’ve ground to an expensive stalemate, raising questions about their futures on each other’s lucrative home turf. Earlier this month Cisco CEO John Chambers admitted in an earnings call that political dynamics were stymieing his company’s long march into Huawei’s backyard. Asked whether the recent U.S. spying scandal was affecting overseas business, Chambers said it was having an impact, particularly in China, which is Cisco’s biggest emerging market country but represents less than 5 percent of its total revenue. Huawei has also admitted something of a defeat in the United State for carrier equipment, which accounts for more than 70 percent of its global revenues. “We are not interested in the U.S. market anymore,” Eric Xu, one of Huawei’s rotating CEOs, said in April. “Generally speaking, it’s not a market that we pay much attention to.” The rivalry reflects how intertwined the communications industry has become with growing concerns about security - and the challenges two communications giants face in building a genuinely global presence in an interconnected world where no major market can be ignored. It wasn’t always like this. Cisco, dominant in building the hardware that links computers and networks since the early 1990s, took little notice of Huawei until it suspected that the Chinese upstart was reverse-engineering its products. It sued the company in 2003 for patent infringement, only settling after Huawei agreed to make changes to its equipment. The wounds are still raw: last year the two sides again aired their grievances against the other, each claiming victory in the original suit. California-based Cisco, former executives said, refused to take Huawei seriously despite warnings that they were making headway in emerging markets with cheaper equipment. “For years San Jose pooh-poohed Huawei until it started hurting in post-2008,” said one former executive. When Cisco did respond, it was by partnering with ZTE Corp, Huawei’s local rival, but that relationship went sour and was formally disbanded in 2012. In the meantime Shenzhen-based Huawei made headway not only into the low-end routers and switches business, but was also eating into Cisco’s home terrain of higher end equipment. “When a competitor’s gear gets good enough, not as good or as secure, then a lot of customers were prepared to go with that,” said another former Cisco executive. For Chambers, the holy grail had long been China. He said in an interview with Reuters last year that he had been visiting the country for 25 years. To a group of Asian journalists visiting Cisco’s headquarters in June 2005 he said: “If I wasn’t American, I would be Chinese,” according to a Xinhua news agency report. In late 2007 he flew to Beijing to pledge $16 billion worth of investments in China over the next 5 years during which time, Chambers said, Cisco’s manufacturing in China would double. By 2009 it had invested in more than 50 Chinese companies. A Cisco s But there has been little to show for it. Cisco’s share of the carrier business - selling switches and routers to service providers - has remained steady in Europe at around 40 percent and has risen in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America in recent years, but has fallen in Asia, according to data from Ovum, a research consultancy. In China it fell from 19 percent in the second quarter of 2010 to 12 percent in the same quarter this year. One former executive who used to travel overseas with Chambers said he would argue in vain with the CEO about the dangers of overinvesting in China, saying his expectations were too ambitious. “John thought he could get more out of it than even a sober assessment at the time suggested couldn’t be done,” he said. For sure, many Western companies have found China harder going than they’d anticipated, but Cisco’s poor performance in China stands in contrast to Huawei’s growing market share. In equipment for service providers, for example, Huawei’s revenues grew by 84 percent between the second quarter of 2010 and this year, against Cisco’s 2.5 percent, according to Ovum data. While Cisco’s market share shrank, Huawei’s grew from 56 percent to 64 percent. And things aren’t likely to get better any time soon. In the wake of Edward Snowden’s revelations about the extent of U.S. National Security Agency electronic spying programs aimed at China, among other countries, some Chinese media have questioned Cisco’s credibility. “Although the company has issued statements saying that it is not involved in monitoring citizens or government communications in China or anywhere else, recent events mean that it may be quite a long time before we can trust Cisco again,” wrote the Beijing-based Global Times on June 20. One Beijing-based source in the technology industry who declined to be identified because of the subject’s sensitivity said China’s desire to eliminate any dependence on foreign technology wasn’t new, but that the NSA revelations had fostered a new sense of urgency. “I’m not sure the government has fundamentally changed course, but they now have the wind at their backs,” he said. Cisco’s woes in China are in some ways a mirror image of what Huawei has been enduring in the United States - albeit more openly. Last year the U.S. House Intelligence Committee released a report urging U.S. telecommunications companies not to do business with Huawei and ZTE because it said potential Chinese state influence on the companies posed a security threat. Both Chinese companies have denied that they have links to the Chinese government. Huawei has spent heavily on lobbying lawmakers and other U.S. officials: $1.2 million in 2012, more than double what it spent in each of the previous four years, according to Senate lobbying records. Snowden’s revelations, however, have offered the company a chance to turn the spotlight back on its rival. While Huawei has for the most part avoided linking Cisco to the NSA allegations, its security chief John Suffolk asked rhetorically on his blog whether “all other Governments ban American technology companies, especially Cisco and Juniper given their position in critical infrastructures?” When Cisco’s spokesperson John Earnhardt posted a denial of any involvement in government monitoring to the blog, Suffolk replied that Cisco should not be surprised if customers and governments “now pose questions about American tech vendors who hold a position where they have the means of contributing to NSA’s strategic arsenal of tools and techniques to exfiltrate data on their targets”. Cisco declined to comment directly on Suffolk’s remarks. Huawei confirmed the blog was written by Suffolk. Since then both sides have said little about the other. Suffolk declined to be interviewed about his comments, and a Huawei white paper on cyber security published in October made no direct reference to Snowden or the NSA. Indeed, some argue it’s in neither company’s interest to prolong discussions that link their industry to their respective government’s eavesdropping efforts. Both sides have distanced themselves from any calls to have the other’s equipment banned on security grounds. Huawei spokesperson Scott Sykes said in response to emailed questions that “Huawei advocates transnational, fair and open competition.” Cisco denies lobbying Congress against Huawei on security issues, and has not “provided any government agency access to our networks”. And neither is there any concrete evidence that either company has added backdoors in their equipment to allow governments access. This, said Jim Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, was deliberate in the case of U.S. companies. As an official at the Department of Commerce, Lewis helped the Clinton administration adopt a policy of not requesting companies to install backdoors. In any case, Lewis said, the United States and at least three other countries had the expertise to eavesdrop with or without a backdoor. “If they want to get into your traffic, they are going to get in into your traffic.” Felix Lindner, CEO of Berlin-based Recurity Labs, a respected expert on both Cisco and Huawei security, says both companies’ equipment contained software that was so poorly written it left them vulnerable to hacking. “In terms of product security they are very much on a par with each other.” Both companies say they take security seriously. Huawei’s Sykes said that “our experts immediately start investigations into potential problems and should there be any security risk we will provide a solution as soon as possible”. Cisco has pointed to security as a commercial advantage in its sale pitches. An internal Cisco sales document obtained by Reuters dated June 2013 highlighted security flaws in Huawei’s low-end routers uncovered by Lindner. The document said: “Huawei also has demonstrated lack of process to communicate and manage such security vulnerabilities.” Whatever the truth, concerns over security and their perceived government links have hobbled both companies in the other’s homeland. For now, Huawei has focused in the U.S. on its handset and enterprise business. And Cisco spokesperson Earnhardt said that despite the poor results “we remain firm in our commitment to China.” Doing anything else, said Naresh Singh, a principal analyst at IT consultancy Gartner, was not an option: “Cisco will have to address China because it’s a very large market, and it’s growing.” ",11222013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cisco-huawei-insight/insight-for-cisco-and-huawei-a-bruising-rivalry-reaches-stalemate-idUSBRE9AL0NO20131122

This, said Jim Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, was deliberate in the case of U.S. companies. As an official at the Department of Commerce, Lewis helped the Clinton administration adopt a policy of not requesting companies to install backdoors. In any case, Lewis said, the United States and at least three other countries had the expertise to eavesdrop with or without a backdoor. “If they want to get into your traffic, they are going to get in into your traffic.” Felix Lindner, CEO of Berlin-based Recurity Labs, a respected expert on both Cisco and Huawei security, says both companies’ equipment contained software that was so poorly written it left them vulnerable to hacking. “In terms of product security they are very much on a par with each other.” Both companies say they take security seriously. Huawei’s Sykes said that “our experts immediately start investigations into potential problems and should there be any security risk we will provide a solution as soon as possible”. Cisco has pointed to security as a commercial advantage in its sale pitches. An internal Cisco sales document obtained by Reuters dated June 2013 highlighted security flaws in Huawei’s low-end routers uncovered by Lindner. The document said: “Huawei also has demonstrated lack of process to communicate and manage such security vulnerabilities.” Whatever the truth, concerns over security and their perceived government links have hobbled both companies in the other’s homeland. For now, Huawei has focused in the U.S. on its handset and enterprise business. And Cisco spokesperson Earnhardt said that despite the poor results “we remain firm in our commitment to China.” Doing anything else, said Naresh Singh, a principal analyst at IT consultancy Gartner, was not an option: “Cisco will have to address China because it’s a very large market, and it’s growing.”   (Additional reporting by Alina Selyukh, Steve Stecklow, Lee Chyenyee, Michael Martina and Paul Carsten)",11222013,http://www.reuters.com/article/cisco-huawei/insight-for-cisco-and-huawei-a-bruising-rivalry-reaches-stalemate-idUSL4N0J61N620131122

357,CSCO,UPDATE 2-HP shares jump on turnaround hopes; margins a concern,"(Adds analyst comment, details on forecast, background and byline) By Poornima Gupta and Neha Alawadhi Nov 27 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co shares soared near their 52-week high on Wednesday after investors saw signs a turnaround plan was gaining traction, but Wall Street worried the improvement was coming at the expense of margins. HP shares jumped nearly 10 percent to $27.56 in afternoon trading, after at least one brokerage raised its rating on the PC maker’s shares and another nine raised their price targets. Expectations had been low for HP’s fourth quarter following a disappointing third quarter and after rivals IBM and Cisco Systems Inc reported poor results. But HP surprised on Tuesday, reporting stronger-than-expected revenue due to growth in its enterprise group, which supplies servers, storage and networking products to corporations. “HP appears to continue to struggle with improving its margins and share together, despite substantial cost cuts - particular in its enterprise business - and we worry about profitless prosperity,” Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a note to clients. Chief Executive Meg Whitman said Tuesday the company needed to improve margins, even as HP’s enterprise sales rose 2 percent compared with a year earlier and 12 percent versus the previous quarter. The cause for concern was that its key operating margin slipped to 9 percent in the quarter from 10.4 percent a year earlier, reflecting aggressive pricing and discounts on products as it competes with rivals like Dell Inc and Lenovo Group Ltd . Brian Alexander, an analyst with Raymond James, said the quarterly results showed “HP is still trying to strike a balance between growth and profitability.” Whitman, who took the helm a little more than a year ago, is trying to put HP back on the growth path though layoffs and focusing on businesses with longer-term potential, such as enterprise and remote computing services. “HP is cutting costs and headcount, but we believe challenges remain structural, with the company still tuned to selling high volumes of relatively low value-add products/services, likely keeping margins under pressure,” Evercore analyst Rob Cihra said in a note. Overall revenue for the fourth quarter was $29.1 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $27.9 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. HP maintained its full-year earnings forecast, which J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Mark Moskowitz said was “more than plenty good after Cisco’s big disappointment.” Moskowitz, who raised his price target to $30 from $29, said HP’s comments on PCs, printing and the enterprise group could suggest a potential bottoming in the company’s model, which could attract value-based and long-term investors. The company, which has been moving away from a declining PC industry, reported a smaller-than-expected drop in PC sales. “In short, HP didn’t guide down for 2014 and that is quite positive so far versus many in ‘old tech,’” Barclays analyst Ben Reitzes said in a research note. He raised his price target to $28 from $26. Some analysts were concerned a slowdown in China would hurt HP. Cisco had warned of weakness in China, while IBM’s sales in China declined in the latest quarter. But Reitzes said HP seemed to be managing volatility in emerging markets far better than its peers, noting revenue in the Asia Pacific region grew 4 percent in the quarter. Growth in the region was helped by a contract to supply laptops to the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, which BMO Capital Markets valued at about $450 million. HP has not disclosed its value. Still, Evercore’s Cihra raised his rating to “equal-weight” from “underweight,” citing an improving balance sheet and a moderation in the decline of its PC and printer businesses. Evercore raised its price target to $25 from $20. Among the nine other firms raising price targets, three increased to $30. Credit Suisse was the biggest mover, with an increase to $30 from $25. HP shares hit a 12-month high of $27.77 on Aug. 2. The stock hit its 12-month low of $12.22 in November last year.

358,CSCO,UPDATE 4-HP enterprise sales pickup stirs turnaround hopes,"(Adds comments on China business in paragraphs 14-18) By Poornima Gupta SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co  beat revenue forecasts as sales growth in its enterprise group inspired cautious optimism about the company’s turnaround plan, and its shares rallied more than 7 percent. Revenue from the sprawling enterprise group, which Chief Executive Meg Whitman is focused on expanding as personal computer sales crumble globally, climbed 2 percent, aided by a 10 percent rise in server sales and 3 percent growth of the networking business. Wall Street had low expectations for HP following a disappointing third-quarter performance, and after rivals such as International Business Machines Corp and Cisco Systems Inc had reported poor results. The pickup in enterprise hardware revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter - coming after a 9 percent slide in sales from the same division in the previous three months - helped shore up confidence in Whitman’s turnaround effort. “I saw better-than-expected performance out of the enterprise group, which we expected to be weak given the results from peers such as IBM and Cisco,” said Edward Jones technology analyst Bill Kreher. “There is some hope, given that the company was able to jump over what was admittedly a pretty low hurdle.” He cautioned, though, that any signs of a turnaround will remain uneven. But the company’s operating margins eroded. Non-GAAP operating margin slipped to 9 percent in the quarter from 10.4 percent a year earlier, reflecting aggressive competition from rivals such as Dell Inc and Lenovo Inc. Whitman, who took the helm of the world’s largest PC maker more than a year ago, is trying to wean the Silicon Valley icon off sales of personal computers. Last month, she told Wall Street she expects revenue to stabilize in 2014, with some areas of growth for the company. With the help of job cuts and expansion into markets and areas with longer-term potential such as enterprise computing services, the CEO is trying to revive growth. Shares in HP climbed above $27 in extended trading, from a close of $25.09 on the New York Stock Exchange. Revenue fell across most of HP’s business divisions except the enterprise group, whose sales edged up to $7.6 billion. Sales from HP’s largest, PC-focused unit slipped 2 percent to $8.58 billion while the printing division’s sales dipped 1 percent to $6.04 billion. In August, Whitman replaced the head of its enterprise group Dave Donatelli with Bill Veghte who had joined HP from Microsoft. At the time, she primarily blamed poor execution by the division for a disappointing fiscal third-quarter result. On Tuesday, Whitman sounded a more upbeat note for HP’s second-largest division by sales. “We have more to do on the margins but we are happy,” Whitman said in an interview. “We had a good quarter in networking, particularly in China and in Europe.” HP faced an aggressive pricing environment and a tough global economy but there were “some bright spots in Asia and in some of our emerging markets,” she added. The company’s performance in China is in stark contrast to the warning of weakness in the region from rival Cisco and  sales declines for IBM. Although Whitman said some of HP’s other businesses didn’t perform as well there as networking and noted the Chinese economy remained uncertain, she added that HP’s renewed focus on the region will help mitigate some of the softness there. HP recently appointed telecommunications veteran Robert Mao as chairman for its China region. Overall, the company posted revenue of $29.1 billion, beating the $27.9 billion expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Non-GAAP net earnings fell 14 percent to $2 billion in the quarter or $1.01 per share, versus the $1.00 analysts had expected on average. Looking forward, HP said it expects non-GAAP earnings per share of 82 to 86 cents for its fiscal first quarter, with the top end coming in slightly higher than 85 cents expected by Wall Street analysts.

359,CSCO,Cisco loses court challenge to Microsoft's takeover of Skype,"LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Microsoft fended off a challenge to its $8.5 billion takeover of messaging service Skype as Europe’s second-highest court ruled against claims by rival Cisco that the 2011 deal would harm competition. The decision on Wednesday means Microsoft can continue to market Skype’s video calls to consumers and businesses without making any concessions to Cisco or others offering similar products. Cisco’s concern about the Skype deal stems from the fact it sells more expensive hardware to help companies with video conferencing, while Microsoft’s alternative, based on Skype, can do much the same via a computer equipped with a webcam. Cisco, the world’s top network equipment maker, said at a hearing in May that Microsoft’s acquisition of Skype, the largest Internet video and voice messaging provider, created a monopoly. Cisco said the European Commission was wrong to approve the deal without demanding concessions from Microsoft. The Luxembourg-based General Court said Cisco had failed to show that the takeover would harm competition. “Microsoft’s acquisition of Skype is compatible with the (European Union’s) internal market. The merger does not restrict competition either on the consumer video communications market or on the business video communications market,” the judges said. The court said Cisco’s large share of the enterprise communications market and the existence of other rivals prevent Microsoft from impeding competition in this sector. Cisco, which filed its challenge together with Italian fixed-line and Internet telephone provider and Skype rival Messagenet SpA, originally said it would not appeal to the EU Court of Justice, Europe’s highest. But it later withdrew that comment. To defend itself against Microsoft, Cisco had pushed for a common set of technology standards in video conferencing to make sure that products offered by different firms work together. It had hoped to get backing from the EU case to ensure such “inter-operability” of video calls. “We are hopeful that in the interest of customers and consumers, Microsoft and others in the industry will join us and continue to rally around this ideal and work together to achieve an open, interoperable video community,” said a spokeswoman. “We have no comment about an appeal.” Consumers and companies have been switching to cheaper Internet-based voice and video services such as Skype, Viber, Google Talk and WhatsApp. A third of the world’s voice calls are now made on Skype, with more than 280 million users spending more than 100 minutes monthly, Microsoft Chief Operating Officer Kevin Turner said in March. Both the Commission and Microsoft welcomed the court ruling. “Today’s judgment by the EU General Court confirms that the Commission was correct in its assessment that the acquisition of Skype by Microsoft would not significantly impede effective competition in the European Economic Area,” the EU antitrust regulator said. The last successful court challenge to a Commission merger-approval decision was in 2002 in a case involving the Sony Music and BMG record labels. The case is T-79/12 Cisco Systems and Messagenet SpA v Commission.

361,CSCO,Analysis: Some Cisco investors urge an exit from set-top box unit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc Chief Executive John Chambers is facing growing pressure from investors to exit its television set-top box business, where revenue has been plummeting and profit margins trail the rest of the company. The problem is that there are few obvious buyers for the unit - the former Scientific Atlanta that Cisco bought for $6.9 billion in 2005 - so Chambers might have no choice but to close the business, analysts said. Cisco stunned the market on November 13 by warning that revenue would fall as much as 10 percent this quarter and keep declining for several quarters. It blamed everything from emerging economy weakness and political backlash in China to company-specific problems, such as market share losses in network equipment and declining sales in set-top boxes. Investors are hoping Chambers gives a clear break-down of the individual impact of all these problems at Cisco’s Financial Analysts Conference on Thursday. But for many, the ailing set-top box business has emerged as a particular sore spot. Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold said it could represent as much as a third of Cisco’s roughly $1 billion revenue miss for its current quarter. The unit, which generates roughly 5 percent of total revenue, had a 20 percent decline in sales in Cisco’s first fiscal quarter ended in October. And Chambers has warned that the decline in this business would continue for “a number of quarters,” but did not say when it might improve. With such a bleak outlook, it might be time for the company to move on from the “past its prime” set-top box business, said Peter Karazeris, an analyst at Thrivent Asset Management, which holds 4 million Cisco shares among its $82 billion in managed assets. “I’d like to see more definitive action there,” said Karazeris, who sees a strategy change as a potential boost for the stock at a time when Cisco investors have little to look forward to. “I think this is diluting the attention.” However, Karazeris said it is not clear how exactly Cisco should move on from the business, whether it could find a buyer or should just shut it down. Since its November warning, Cisco shares have fallen more than 11 percent compared with a 2 percent increase in the Nasdaq composite index. The shares of smaller network equipment rival Juniper have risen almost 12 percent in the same period. Cisco bought Scientific Atlanta to enter the business of set-top boxes, which are connected to TV sets to receive and unscramble digital signals, and can also support services such as video on demand. But this past February, Cisco said it had started to forgo sales of less profitable set-top boxes and was instead seeking higher margin business from video service providers. At best, traditional set-top boxes offer roughly half the gross profit margins Cisco seeks to maintain company wide. Cisco has said so far that it will keep offering set-top boxes to big customers who want a whole package of products and services, but it will focus primarily on supporting so-called cloud-based video services. Cloud-based services, which can include mobile video access and digital video recording, rely on high-end equipment on the operator’s network rather than the set-top boxes inside consumer homes. But such services are nascent, so it is unclear when they will bear fruit. In the meantime, Cisco has let sales dwindle at the set-top box business, which has $2.6 billion in annual revenue, as it instead favors products that can help achieve its target non-GAAP gross margins of 61 percent to 62 percent. Since set-top boxes only generate profit margins in a range of 25 percent to 30 percent, according to Needham & Co analyst Richard Valera, there might be no way for Cisco to keep selling these products if it is to maintain its goals. “The only way for them to fix it is to effectively walk away from that business,” said Valera, who sees no chance of an uptick in set-top box margins, which he says are “fundamentally incompatible with the business model they want.” Valera said Cisco’s biggest rival Arris Group Inc would be unlikely to have the capacity to buy the business as it spent $2.35 billion buying Motorola’s set-top box business from Google Inc in April. If Cisco’s unit were to command a valuation that was similar to the Motorola deal, it would fetch just $1.8 billion, well below the 2005 Scientific Atlanta purchase price. Arris led the global market in 2012 followed closely by Cisco, then U.K.-based Pace Plc and Echostar Corp ahead of South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, according to data from market research firm IHS. One person familiar with Cisco said set-top boxes are not a core business for the company, and noted that Cisco has shown a willingness to step away from businesses that did not fit in with its bigger strategy in the past. The person cited its 2011 shutdown of its Flip video camera business, acquired just two years earlier for $590 million. Some investors still hope Cisco can turn around the set-top business, but they want answers sooner rather than later. “They’ve been kicking the can down the road on that one,” said Scott Rodes, an analyst at investment firm Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel Inc. He wants more details about Cisco’s prospects in cloud services and its intentions for the existing business. His firm holds about 4.79 million Cisco shares. Peter Tuz, President at Chase Investment Counsel Corp, which has under 10,000 shares of Cisco in its $520 million assets under management, said “traditional set top boxes will be challenged going forward” as consumers switch to online video. Tuz added that Cisco should put the unit, “on a fairly short leash, give it another year or so, then take action if it is determined it can’t grow or produce decent returns going forward.” ",12112013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cisco-settopboxes-analysis/analysis-some-cisco-investors-urge-an-exit-from-set-top-box-unit-idUSBRE9BA0G020131211

364,CSCO,"Cisco cuts long-term revenue, earnings targets","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc on Thursday cut its longer-term earnings and revenue growth targets due to problems in emerging markets, conservative customer spending and stalling growth in its core business of network equipment, the latest in a drumbeat of bleak developments at the Silicon Valley company. The company’s shares fell as much as 3 percent to a seven-month low after it cut its three- to five-year revenue growth target to a range of 3 percent to 6 percent at its analysts’ meeting. Its previous range was 5 percent to 7 percent. Cisco, which issued a warning on November 13 that revenue would decline in the current and coming quarters, also reduced its target for earnings-per-share growth to a range of 5 percent to 7 percent for the same period from its previous target of 7 percent to 9 percent. Chief Financial Officer Frank Calderoni said revenue in Cisco’s core network equipment business would be flat to up 1 percent in the same time frame. He promised higher growth in areas such as software, services and security products. BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim long said that while Cisco was seeing exciting growth in some areas, he saw the slump in growth in its core router and switch market as a “big disappointment.” ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall said Cisco’s new targets were more realistic given the challenges it is facing. In response to analyst worries about how much of Cisco’s troubles were specific to the company as opposed to industry-wide, Chief Executive John Chambers said Cisco tends to suffer from macro issues ahead of rivals. “We are the canary in the coal mine,” Chambers said, noting that the company often sees problems two to three quarters ahead of peers. But Chambers told reporters that it also means Cisco benefits from improving economies more quickly than other companies. Chambers said he was beginning to see the U.S. market recover but cited challenges in emerging-market economies such as Russia and Brazil. “If the U.S. does well we’ll pull the rest of the world out of this,” he told reporters after the meeting. While emerging markets were “extremely challenged” right now, Chambers said, he expects Cisco to grow in those regions, when they recover, by 6 percent to 10 percent. For the U.S. market, Chambers cited strong growth prospects in the enterprise market, as its sales pipeline for big deals of between $1 million to $5 million in that segment is up 20 percent or more. Enterprise customers account for about 23 percent of Cisco’s overall revenue. Cisco stunned the market last month by warning that revenue would fall as much as 10 percent this quarter and could keep declining for several quarters. The company blamed factors from emerging-economy weakness and political backlash in China to company-specific problems, such as market-share losses in network equipment and declining sales of set-top boxes. Chambers said it would take some time for the company to work out its issues in China, but he said Cisco would compete in China for the long term. Aside from emerging markets, Cisco’s biggest problem in the quarter ended in October was a 13 percent decline in sales to service providers, which represent about 31 percent of overall revenue. Chambers said the drop in demand from service providers included a 6 percent decline in sales of set-top boxes, a 2 percent decline relating to its launch of new products and a 2 percent decline due to a loss of market share in equipment used at the edge of operator networks. Some investors were hoping Cisco would provide a detailed plan on Thursday for the future of its set-top box business where it has decided to forgo some sales of less-profitable products. Some people are hoping it exits that market. But Rob Lloyd, president of development and sales, said the company is “not getting out of set-top boxes.” The executive said that while the business is putting pressure on revenue, the company wants to keep those products so they can provide them to bigger customers as it tries to switch focus to other products for video service providers. However Lloyd told reporters that the switch in focus from set-top boxes to more profitable products would be a “multi-year transition for Cisco” involving more revenue declines. He did not say when Cisco’s video business would return to growth. Cisco shares closed down 1.8 percent at $20.51 on the Nasdaq, up from an earlier low at $20.26. The shares closed at $24 the day before Cisco’s November 13 revenue warning.

366,CSCO,"Cisco resurgence in China to require time, patience: CEO Chambers","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Chief Executive John Chambers said on Thursday that the network equipment company is preparing for a long battle to improve its business in China, one that will not be won “in a quarter or two.” The company’s revenue in China fell by 18 percent in the quarter ended in October, a major contributor to a 21 percent decline in the company’s top five emerging markets. Cisco said on November 13 that a backlash against U.S. government spying in China contributed to its declining revenue, after a former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden exposed widespread surveillance - in particular through Internet data, much of which is transmitted via Cisco equipment. It said that the spying scandal, which involved multiple countries, was not a significant issue for Cisco outside of China. Chambers said Cisco is “in China for the long run,” but he was reluctant to offer much detail on how the company plans to improve its business in the country, where China-based rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd has been gaining a lot of ground. “You have to be very patient and you have to work the issues through and you have to keep the conversations that you have at all levels confidential because otherwise you won’t have any more,” Chambers told reporters after the company’s financial analyst conference in New York. Chambers repeated a previous comment he had made in China, that he would love to be Chinese if he were not American. He was also quick to distance himself from any collaboration with the U.S. government to win back business in China. “We’re not asking help from any government leaders,” he said. Instead Cisco head of sales Chuck Robbins will travel to China every quarter and Chambers himself as well as Rob Lloyd, president of development and sales, will take turns visiting China to help improve relationships. Chambers also said Owen Chang, Cisco’s chief executive of greater China, has the patience needed to help improve the company’s business there. Cisco’s efforts in China “will be a series of quiet moves,” rather than something that would be quickly noticeable, said Chambers. He said that “the Chinese send messages very subtly. Who sits beside who at a table, who you meet when you go to China, who you don’t meet ... And do you do joint ventures or not, what key market opportunities do you have.” “It’s a slowly evolving area. Its an area I’m personally very comfortable with,” he said. “I’ve been there 28 years so I know the culture and the leaders.” Chambers said it would be in the best interests of the United States and China for their companies in technology and other sectors to work together. “In many ways I think our countries have goals that are more aligned than adversarial,” he said. However, Cisco has had a bitter rivalry with China’s Huawei for years, starting with a patent-infringement lawsuit brought by Cisco about a decade ago. Chambers would not say if he thought Cisco’s difficulties in China came in retaliation after the U.S. government effectively banned the sale of Huawei’s equipment here last year. “I think there is a focus on China national pride and using indigenous innovation and their own technology companies. I think it’s more along that line. Huawei has done a good job marketing over there,” Chambers said.

372,CSCO,Germany should ban U.S. contracting companies passing data to NSA: report,"BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. contracting companies such as Cisco, which manages much of the German armed forces’ data, should be contractually barred from passing sensitive information to the U.S. security services, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives was quoted saying. German news magazine Focus on Saturday cited Hans-Peter Uhl, parliamentary spokesman on interior policy for the conservatives, as saying Cisco needed to be required by contract not to pass sensitive material to the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). He said the German government wanted to monitor U.S. contracting companies more closely in future. A spokeswoman for the German government declined to comment on the Focus magazine report. Reports earlier this year that the NSA had tapped phones and emails in Europe, including Merkel’s mobile phone, caused outrage in Germany, where memories remain of eavesdropping by the Stasi secret police during communist rule in East Germany. U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday tried to strike a middle ground on questions about surveillance practices by the NSA, saying some checks were needed on the system but “we can’t unilaterally disarm.” ",12212013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-spying/germany-should-ban-u-s-contracting-companies-passing-data-to-nsa-report-idUSBRE9BK07P20131221

374,CSCO,"Hedge fund Elliott offers to buy Riverbed, higher bid expected","(Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp offered to buy Riverbed Technology Inc for about $3.08 billion in cash, a move analysts said was likely to trigger higher bids for the network equipment maker. Riverbed shares rose as much as 14 percent to $20.29 on Wednesday, above Elliott’s offer price of $19 per share. Elliott, run by Paul Singer, is known for publicly agitating for a sale or a board shakeup in companies in which it invests, pushing stock prices higher. “With Riverbed shares currently trading above the $19 offer price, we believe it represents the first step in this ‘game of high stakes poker’, and that ultimately Elliott’s activism will lead to higher shareholder value for investors,” FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note. Elliott has in the past pushed for a sale of technology companies such as Compuware Corp, BMC Software Inc, NetApp Inc, Novell Inc and Blue Coat Systems Inc. Elliott affiliates said in November that Riverbed was significantly undervalued and should consider a strategic review. Gabelli & Co analyst Hendi Susanto said the offer was below his valuation of $25 per share for Riverbed, based on 14 times 2014 earnings. The offer represents a 6 percent premium to Riverbed’s Tuesday close, but is 26 percent higher than the stock’s price before Elliott disclosed a total stake of 10.4 percent in the company in November. The hedge fund said it could raise its offer if it was allowed access to Riverbed’s books. Elliott also has a “go shop” provision in its offer, allowing Riverbed’s board to solicit competing bids. “I don’t think Riverbed’s management currently wants to sell and this could push the deal higher in my opinion,” FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi told Reuters. Riverbed confirmed that it has received a proposal from Elliott and said its board would review the offer taking into account the company’s current plan and growth initiatives. Bloomberg reported in November that Riverbed was working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc on a potential sale. Riverbed has attracted interest from a number of private equity firms, said a source familiar with the matter. The company has been struggling with the integration of Opnet, a maker of software to manage traffic on networks that it acquired in 2012. Through the acquisition, Riverbed aimed to counter a slowdown in its main wide area network optimization business. The rise in Riverbed shares since Elliott’s November statement has factored in the possibility of a deal, Seyrafi said.

376,CSCO,UPDATE 2-Riverbed's rejection of offer puts focus on turnaround,"(Adds details, analysts’ comments; updates shares) By Neha Alawadhi and Lehar Maan Jan 15 (Reuters) - Riverbed Technology Inc rejected hedge fund Elliott Management Corp’s $3.08 billion offer, increasing pressure on the network gear maker to deliver on its turnaround plans. Riverbed said the offer did not reflect its success in turning around its business. Shares of Riverbed, which also raised its fourth-quarter forecast above analysts’ expectations, rose to $20.02, above Elliott’s offer of $19 per share. “Riverbed will continue to try to go it alone and execute on its strategy, but Elliott may increase its bid to a point that Riverbed finds acceptable,” FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi told Reuters. Riverbed’s revenue missed analysts’ estimates in the first three quarters of 2013 as the company struggles to integrate Opnet, a maker of software to manage traffic on networks, which it bought in 2012. The company had hoped the acquisition would help counter a slowdown in its main wide-area network optimization business. Riverbed’s shares have been languishing in the $20 range since late 2011. Elliott declined to comment. “We now see private equity getting involved in the process and possibly putting another bid in,” said FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives, who values Riverbed in the “mid-$20s”. Analysts have said potential bidders could include larger rivals Cisco Systems Inc and F5 Networks Inc. F5 shares were up 3.6 percent at $97.92 in midday trading on the Nasdaq on Wednesday. Elliott, run by Paul Singer, first disclosed a 9 percent stake in Riverbed in November, and offered to buy the company last week. The hedge fund holds a total stake of 10.4 percent in the company. Riverbed forecast first-quarter revenue of $262 million-$268 million, above analysts’ average expectation of $258.5 million. It estimated fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 30-31 cents per share on revenue of $284 million to $285 million. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 26 cents per share on revenue of $273.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

378,CSCO,"UPDATE 3-China's Huawei profit jumps on smartphones, US asks Hua-who?","* Operating profit at 28.6 bln to 29.4 bln yuan vs 2012’s audited 19.96 bln yuan * 2013 revenue 238 bln to 240 bln yuan, up 8 percent, boosted by smartphones * Lack of U.S. brand recognition hampers handset growth * Delay on 4G network construction revenue cuts into growth By Paul Carsten BEIJING, Jan 15 (Reuters) - China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, known more for its telecom networking prowess than its razor-thin smartphones, is starting to see success in its consumer electronics business, though the key U.S. market remains elusive. Huawei became the world’s third-biggest smartphone manufacturer last year, mainly due to a fast-growing Chinese market. That is helping cushion the impact of a global slowdown in network equipment spending, which caused the company to miss its revenue growth target last year. Consumer devices will also help Huawei buy some time before 4G network upgrades in China lead to more orders for telecom equipment. Huawei’s smartphone ventures, like its domestic rivals ZTE Corp  and Lenovo Group Ltd, have so far focused on selling low- and mid-priced handsets in emerging markets. The companies have yet to gain a foothold in the high-end segment of developed markets - such as the United States - that offer wider margins. Huawei’s name is virtually unknown - and unpronounceable - in the U.S., the second-biggest smartphone market, where lawmakers have flagged Chinese telecommunications equipment as potential security risks. “Huawei in an ideal world would love to be in the U.S. but it’s probably better for them to be seen as eyeing up the market than be seen as begging,” said Duncan Clark, chairman of Beijing-based tech advisory BDA. “They can probably succeed in the U.S. in this world of consumer electronics, where consumers, not carriers, can choose what to buy.” Consumer devices accounted for 23 percent of Huawei’s overall revenue last year, up from 22 percent in 2012. That helped lift total unaudited revenue to 238 billion yuan to 240 billion yuan ($39.73 billion), Chief Financial Officer Cathy Meng told a press briefing on Wednesday. Unaudited revenue grew 8 percent, compared with a target of 10 percent annual growth for the next five years, starting in 2013. Unaudited operating profit rose to 28.6 billion yuan to 29.4 billion yuan, the company said. That compared with an audited 2012 operating profit of 19.96 billion yuan - an increase of 43.3 percent. The company put the leap in operating profit down to changes in internal management and reducing operating costs. Huawei will release audited results in March or April, including net profit which should not be largely different from operating profit, the company said. Huawei had a 5.1 percent share of the global smartphone market in October-December, a distant third behind Samsung Electronics Co Ltd with 35.2 percent and Apple Inc  with 13.4 percent, according to Strategy Analytics. “Huawei had some ambivalence to smartphones, at one point thinking of selling off the unit, but they made a conscious decision to embrace it,” said BDA’s Clark. “It’s been a lower-margin business than other areas but the end-to-end vision, it’s going to be part of the future.” Huawei aspires to challenge Samsung and Apple and in the United States but it has virtually no brand recognition there beyond its association with espionage, and has only a smattering of low-key tie-ups with U.S. carriers through which most consumers buy their phones. The Shenzhen-based maker has sought to change that by splashing out on a prime location at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. It has no such issues in its home market which contributed around 50 percent of growth last year in its consumer devices business, a company spokesman said. Sales are also strong in Europe, according to the company, where the European Commission is poised to launch an investigation into anti-competitive behaviour by Chinese producers of telecoms equipment. Its consumer electronics business grew 13.2 percent year-on-year based on Reuters calculations. “The handset business is quite profitable and operating above expectations,” said Huang Leping, a Hong Kong-based technology analyst with Nomura. Huawei targeted smartphone shipments of 60 million units last year. The company said actual shipments reached 52 million units, which Huang called “quite a good result.” Huawei is the world’s second-biggest telecom equipment maker after Sweden’s Ericsson, and is known for aggressively gaining sales by edging out rivals such as Cisco Systems Inc, Alcatel-Lucent SA, Nokia Siemens Networks. Its carrier network business booked 70 percent of unaudited revenue for 2013 but only grew 4.1 percent according to Reuters calculations, despite China and a slew of other countries contracting Huawei to help build fourth-generation mobile networks. The company has also suffered by being excluded from building networks in the U.S. and Australia because of fears it is linked to the Chinese government - allegations it denies. The company has come under scrutiny in Britain over cyber security issues. The carrier business group’s growth rate “was not as pretty as the two other groups, but the base number is very big,” Chief Financial Officer Cathy Meng told a press briefing. But analysts say 4G deployment in China hasn’t been as fast as expected, so revenue from the network roll-out destined for Huawei and cross-town competitor ZTE will not be seen until the first half of this year. “For 4G, they have a delay on revenue in China,” said Nomura’s Huang. “Deployment was slower than expected, so there is revenue postponed until the first half of this year, particularly some short-term delays on China Mobile’s deployment speed.” The rest of Huawei’s revenue, or 7 percent, comes from its enterprise segment, which makes telecommunications devices for businesses and institutions, and which is not profitable, according to Meng. Addressing the company’s woes over cyber-security issues in the U.S. and elsewhere, Meng said it is “all decided by the market.” “We have seen no incidents on networks due to security problems,” Meng said. “A lot of reports say Huawei equipment has more vulnerabilities or is more easily breached. These reports are groundless.” ",1152014,http://www.reuters.com/article/huawei-results/update-3-chinas-huawei-profit-jumps-on-smartphones-us-asks-hua-who-idUSL3N0KO2NK20140115
379,CSCO,UPDATE 1-Mexico draws over $7 bln in foreign investment at Davos,"By Martinne Geller and Dmitry Zhdannikov DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Pepsico, Nestle and Cisco on Friday announced major investments that together totaled more than $7 billion in Mexico, where the government has pushed through a series of economic reforms that aim to boost foreign investment and growth. Mexico has embraced free trade policies in recent decades, and has drawn growing investment interest after President Enrique Pena Nieto made a landmark reform drive in his first year in office, pushing major telecommunications, energy, banking and tax legislation through a divided Congress. “It is very encouraging to see the enthusiasm that has been awoken by our country due to the structural changes that are happening,” Pena Nieto said at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. Pepsico said it would spend $5 billion in Mexico over five years to strengthen its food and beverage business, adding it planned to expand its production capacity by adding new manufacturing lines and expand delivery routes. The company said the investment was expected to create 4,000 new jobs. The Pepsico investment comes despite a new levy on soft drinks and junk foods included in Pena Nieto’s tax overhaul. Nestle said it planned to invest $1 billion in Mexico over five years, building two new factories and expanding a third in its sixth-biggest market. The world’s No. 1 food maker said it would build an infant nutrition factory in Jalisco and a pet-food factory in Guanajuato, as well as expanding an existing cereal factory. The investment would create 700 direct jobs, Nestle said. The Mexican factories will produce goods for the wider region. For example, about 40 percent of the output from the baby food factory will be exported to Latin America and the Caribbean. In the third major investment announcement at Davos, Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc said it would direct $1.35 billion into Mexican manufacturing operations and a support center this year. Pena Nieto has said that foreign direct investment (FDI) in Mexico totaled $28 billion during the first 9 months of 2013. FDI was boosted last year by the Belgian-based beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev’s acquisition of Grupo Modelo , which went through at the end of May and brought in about $13 billion. Separately, Mexican state-run company Pemex will sign a cooperation memorandum with Russia’s No.2 oil producer Lukoil  on Friday, Pemex chief executive Emilio Lozoya told Reuters, as the country is opening up its energy sector in a move to boost production. Lozoya said that Pemex and Lukoil would share information on the deep water and shale deposits that Mexico currently lacks the expertise to tap. The planned cooperation between Lukoil and Pemex comes after Pena Nieto last month signed a bill into law that ended the country’s 75-year-old oil and gas monopoly. Under the legislation, which is still being mapped out, foreign companies will be able to enter the sector as Pemex is seeking to bring in expertise and boost efficiency. “There are dozens of new players who now come and look at the opportunities that are opening up in Mexico,” Pemex CEO Lozoya said. Lozoya said he met with various companies in Davos that expressed interest in exploration and production projects in Mexico as well as refining, petrochemicals and transportation businesses that are now open to private investment. As a private company, Lukoil is struggling to get large new deposits in Russia, including offshore, and is actively pursuing a foreign expansion to maintain its production levels.",1242014,http://www.reuters.com/article/davos-mexico/update-1-mexico-draws-over-7-bln-in-foreign-investment-at-davos-idUSL2N0KY0YX20140124
380,CSCO,Obama urges Congress to pass anti-patent troll bill,"WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama called for Congress to pass legislation aimed at reining in what many companies complain are proliferating and frivolous patent infringement lawsuits. Tech companies have long complained about the lawsuits, often filed by companies derisively called “patent trolls,” but retailers, coffee shops, banks and others have since been accused of infringement and joined the ranks of those lobbying lawmakers for protection. The president announced a blueprint for reducing the number of lawsuits in June and reiterated support for the effort on Tuesday night. “And let’s pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation, not costly, needless litigation,” said Obama in his State of the Union address. There are a range of bills before Congress on the matter but two are seen as having the best chance of becoming law. The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Dec. 5 to approve a bill sponsored by Robert Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican, that encourages judges hearing patent cases to award fees to the winner of an infringement lawsuit. The bill also requires companies filing infringement lawsuits to detail which patent is infringed - something that does not now reliably happen. Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has sponsored similar legislation. Differences between the House and Senate bills would need to be ironed out before patent legislation could become law. Technology companies largely support the proposed measures, including Cisco Systems Inc, Apple Inc, International Business Machines Corp, Google Inc  and other powerhouses. The Association for Competitive Technology, which represents small tech companies, also backs the legislation. But others worry that the proposed legislation could hurt small companies whose patents are genuinely infringed. They fear the measure would tip the judicial balance in favor of defendants in patent infringement lawsuits.",1292014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-obama-patent/obama-urges-congress-to-pass-anti-patent-troll-bill-idUSL2N0L225Z20140129

384,CSCO,U.S. mobile data traffic to jump nearly eight-fold by 2018: Cisco,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The volume of data crossing U.S. mobile networks will grow almost eight-fold by 2018, and demand for Internet-connected devices will also skyrocket, according to a report released on Wednesday that poses questions about U.S. spectrum policy. U.S. consumers will download and upload more data on their smartphones in 2018 than they did on their laptops in 2013, according to a forecast by Cisco Systems Inc. Americans will continue to lead the world as earlier and faster converts to new smart devices and networks, the Cisco report said. “It’s more people, more connections, faster speeds on the networks and then more rich content, which in this case is video, video, video,” Robert Pepper, Cisco’s vice president for global technology policy, told Reuters. Cisco, one of the leading makers of networking equipment, studies the use and speed of devices, connections and data for an annual forecast of mobile data traffic trends. U.S. wireless networks will continue to experience a steep increase in so-called machine-to-machine communications, as Americans seek the convenience of devices that talk to each other and the Internet, like remotely operated thermostats or smart anti-theft sensors, according to Cisco’s forecast. Internet-linked devices will keep spreading at a fast clip, with some 271 million connections between gadgets and the Internet forecast for 2018 - an eight-fold jump from 35 million in 2013 that is driven by the predicted boom in wearable devices like activity-tracking wristband Fitbit, Pepper said. By 2018, Cisco predicts that U.S. mobile data traffic will reach 2.7 exabytes a month - equal to the amount of data stored on some 675 million DVDs. In 2013, less than half an exabyte of data crossed U.S. networks on average per month. The findings contribute to the growing concerns in the telecommunications industry that demand for data will soon far exceed the networks’ capacity, and connection speeds will slow. Though some have argued that technological advancements may prevent the crisis, wireless companies say they need more airwaves to evade the spectrum crunch. “If we don’t add more spectrum in the long term, what it means for cellular networks is congestion, particularly in the peak hours and particularly in urban areas,” said Mary Brown, Cisco’s director of government affairs. The Federal Communications Commission is stepping up its work to reshuffle ownership of airwaves, including efforts to clear large slices of frequencies controlled by government agencies for use by private companies and consumers. Cisco also forecast that U.S. carriers will increasingly rely on WiFi connections to automatically divert data traffic, nearly two-thirds of it by 2018. “Even as networks get more and more powerful, they’re certainly continuing to add to the amount of traffic that’s traveling over both cellular and WiFi networks,” Brown said. “We’re going to need more than just technological improvements to satisfy those demand curves. We’re going to need more spectrum.” ",2052014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-spectrum-cisco/u-s-mobile-data-traffic-to-jump-nearly-eight-fold-by-2018-cisco-idUSBREA140VY20140205

By 2018, Cisco predicts that U.S. mobile data traffic will reach 2.7 exabytes a month - equal to the amount of data stored on some 675 million DVDs. In 2013, less than half an exabyte of data crossed U.S. networks on average per month. The findings contribute to the growing concerns in the telecommunications industry that demand for data will soon far exceed the networks’ capacity, and connection speeds will slow. Though some have argued that technological advancements may prevent the crisis, wireless companies say they need more airwaves to evade the spectrum crunch. “If we don’t add more spectrum in the long term, what it means for cellular networks is congestion, particularly in the peak hours and particularly in urban areas,” said Mary Brown, Cisco’s director of government affairs. The Federal Communications Commission is stepping up its work to reshuffle ownership of airwaves, including efforts to clear large slices of frequencies controlled by government agencies for use by private companies and consumers. Cisco also forecast that U.S. carriers will increasingly rely on WiFi connections to automatically divert data traffic, nearly two-thirds of it by 2018. “Even as networks get more and more powerful, they’re certainly continuing to add to the amount of traffic that’s traveling over both cellular and WiFi networks,” Brown said. “We’re going to need more than just technological improvements to satisfy those demand curves. We’re going to need more spectrum.”",2052014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-spectrum-cisco/u-s-mobile-data-traffic-to-jump-nearly-8-fold-by-2018-cisco-idUSL2N0L81PB20140205
386,CSCO,"FireEye takes on Cisco, Palo Alto with new cyber product","(Reuters) - Cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc plans to take on Cisco Systems Inc and Palo Alto Networks Inc in selling intrusion prevention systems, which help companies detect cyber threats that breach their firewalls. FireEye said on Monday it wants to start selling the new products by the middle of this year, adding to its existing technology that helps protect computers from infection by tainted messages and malicious websites. The intrusion prevention systems (IPS) market totaled nearly $1.9 billion in 2012, according to market research firm IDC. That is nearly 10 times the size of the market for specialized threat analysis and protection technology, for which FireEye is best known. “They are really working to broaden their addressable market,” said John Grady, an analyst with IDC who was briefed by FireEye on the new IPS technology. Besides Cisco and Palo Alto Networks, other players in the IPS market include Intel Corp and Trend Micro Inc, according to Grady. FireEye has been aggressively expanding since it went public last year in one of the hottest U.S. stock market debuts. Its shares have nearly quadrupled since September 2013 and jumped 8.65 percent to close at $78.85 on Monday on the Nasdaq. In December, FireEye purchased cyber forensics and security software firm Mandiant Corp for about $1 billion. The company is best known for uncovering a Chinese military unit believed to be behind a series of hacking attacks on U.S. companies. Entering the IPS market is part of FireEye Chief Executive Dave DeWalt’s strategy of developing a technology platform that customers can use to run a variety of products to protect their networks from cyber attacks. When he was named CEO in November 2012, FireEye’s technology was well regarded by industry analysts, but many described it as a provider of a niche product that companies needed to bolt on to software and equipment from bigger security firms. Adding new product lines could help the company achieve profitability. FireEye has reported large losses over the past year as DeWalt spent heavily to build a global sales force to market its products. “They continue to add more notches on their product belt,” said FBR analyst Daniel Ives. “Combined with Mandiant, they’re front and center to really be one of the main consolidators in terms of overall (security) spending, to gain more of a share of the overall budgets.” FireEye posted an operating loss of $111 million in the first nine months of last year, though revenue more than doubled from a year earlier to $104 million. In addition to the IPS product, FireEye also plans to unveil tools to analyze security events and describe how it has incorporated Mandiant’s threat detection software into its platform, according to a company spokesman. When asked if other acquisitions are in the works, DeWalt said by email that the company would “be opportunistic with future acquisitions as the need arises.” ",2102014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fireye-product/fireeye-takes-on-cisco-palo-alto-with-new-cyber-product-idUSBREA191WB20140210

389,CSCO,Cisco predicts third-quarter revenue fall in line with Wall Street view,"(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) on Wednesday forecast a 6 to 8 percent revenue slide this quarter, roughly in line with Wall Street expectations, as the network gear maker struggles with sluggish emerging markets like China. The outlook marks another severe decline in sales for the former high-flying tech company, which has blamed its poor run on a boycott of U.S. equipment after revelations of American spying efforts globally. Cisco’s outlook for the fiscal third quarter ending April translates to a forecast for revenue of between $11.2 billion and $11.5 billion, versus the $11.3 billion analysts expect on average. Shares in the company slipped 4.3 percent to $21.89 in extended trade, from a $22.85 close on the Nasdaq. In the second quarter, revenue from routers and switching equipment, which together make up slightly more than half of the company’s overall revenue, both contracted more than 10 percent. The company reported revenue of $11.2 billion in its second fiscal quarter, down from $12.1 billion a year earlier. Wall Street on average expected Cisco to report of $11.03 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Asia Pacific sales fell 4 percent to $1.8 billion in the fiscal second quarter ended January. But revenue in the Americas led declines, with a 9 percent fall in the quarter. “They put a pretty low bar for the second quarter. They reached their numbers on the reset. It shows the environment has stabilized,” said Zeus Kerravalla at ZK research. Cisco reported non-GAAP earnings of 47 cents per share in the second quarter, a penny better than the 46 cents expected. “The strong quarter is usually the fourth quarter and they have some product transitions to go through. I am curious to see how emerging markets did,” Kerravalla said.

The Nasdaq rose for a fifth straight session, boosted by strong results at TripAdvisor, while the Dow felt the pressure from P&G; and ended the day slightly lower. The S&P; 500 gained 3.9 percent over the past four sessions, its best four-day performance in 13 months. The move put it about 1.6 percent below its record closing high of 1,848.38 set on Jan. 15. “There isn’t a big discount to the market since valuations remain at or approaching fair value, but we don’t see it as overly expensive since earnings are growing steadily,” said Eric Teal, chief investment officer of First Citizens Bancshares in Raleigh, North Carolina. “We’re seeing a better tone in the market after a rough start to the month.” The recent advance came after Wall Street’s sharpest drop in more than a year, with a selloff triggered by turmoil in emerging markets. Those issues still play into markets, with Procter & Gamble saying its lower full-year earnings and sales outlook was related to the devaluation of currencies in various developing markets. Shares of P&G; lost 1.7 percent to close at $77.49. “Stocks that are closely tied to consumer spending patterns will see some volatility ahead,” said Teal, who helps oversee $3.5 billion in assets. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 30.83 points, or 0.19 percent, to end at 15,963.94. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost just 0.49 of a point, or 0.03 percent, to finish at 1,819.26. The Nasdaq Composite Index  gained 10.24 points, or 0.24 percent, to close at 4,201.29. In other earnings news, TripAdvisor Inc was the S&P; 500’s biggest percentage gainer, climbing 7.2 percent to $90.27 a day after the travel website company reported revenue that beat expectations. Owens Corning shares jumped 8.7 percent to $43.20 after the building products maker reported adjusted fourth-quarter profits that more than tripled, driven by a rebound in the U.S. housing market. Of 365 companies in the S&P; 500 that had reported earnings through Wednesday morning, 67.7 percent have beaten profit expectations, above the long-term average of 63 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. More than 66 percent have beaten revenue forecasts, above the historical average of 61 percent. Still, there are signs of weakness, with 4.8 companies warning about their first-quarter results for every one with positive guidance, according to Thomson Reuters data. After the market closed, Cisco Systems Inc shares fell 4.2 percent to $21.88 after the network equipment maker reported a drop in revenue, though the decline was less than expected. Whole Foods Market Inc shares lost 6.4 percent to $51.90 after the largest U.S. natural and organic grocery chain cut its full-year sales and profit view. NetApp Inc  shares fell 3.7 percent in extended-hours trading following the company’s release of quarterly results after the market closed. Amazon.com Inc fell 3.5 percent to $349.25 after UBS downgraded the stock of the world’s largest online retailer to “neutral,” while the shares of both Lorillard Inc and Intuit Inc slumped after their results. Shares of tobacco company Lorillard fell 5 percent to $47.47. The stock of mobile payment company Intuit dropped 4.1 percent to $69.72.

394,CSCO,Cisco results to reflect sales slump; investors brace for more bad news,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors who were shocked by Cisco Systems Inc’s dire financial outlook in its last quarterly earnings report are bracing for more bad news when the network equipment maker reports results on Wednesday. Cisco warned on November 13 that revenue would decline as much as 10 percent in its second fiscal quarter ended in January and that it would not resume growth for several quarters. It blamed weak demand in emerging markets and from service provider customers as well as a backlash against U.S. government spying in China. Now, investors may face more gloomy predictions when the company reports fiscal second-quarter results after the market closes on Wednesday, according to analysts. “Expectations are pretty low. I think the company is not going to be upbeat,” said Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold. “They’ll meet expectations on earnings, they’ll tell us the environment is tough and that they’re working to restore their growth.” Leopold said that some investors had hoped that the company was being overly cautious when it issued its bleak financial targets in November. But with few signs of improvement from the broader market, Leopold said that any hopes of a quick turnaround have faded. “That seemingly conservative guidance seems pretty appropriate,” said Leopold, citing broader concerns about weakness in emerging markets and weak reports from other companies with exposure there. International Business Machines Corp, another U.S. technology bellwether with emerging markets exposure, missed its revenue expectations for the fourth quarter in a row in January, citing weakness in markets such as China. Wall Street on average expects Cisco to report earnings per share of 37 cents on revenue of $11.027 billion for its fiscal second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian Marshall said Cisco’s woes could reach a trough in its fiscal third quarter but added that its “outlook remains uncertain.” “We expect emerging market demand to remain challenged in the near-term and the service provider weakness appears to be more of a Cisco-specific issue,” White said. The average analyst estimate is for fiscal third quarter revenue of $11.34 billion, which represents a slight sequential increase but a big decline from the year-ago revenue of $12.2 billion. Cisco shares, which closed at $24 on November 13 ahead of the company’s warning, fell almost 16 percent to $20.24 by mid-December, when Cisco also cut its long-term growth targets. The stock has gradually improved and closed at $22.71 on Tuesday. But this is likely because of investors’ long-term hopes rather than any illusions about a quick turnaround. “Anybody who’s been buying here is certainly going to be patient,” Leopold said.

395,CSCO,Wall St. closes higher; Nasdaq up for sixth straight day,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks closed higher on Thursday, with the Nasdaq rising for a sixth straight day, as investors looked past disappointing data on consumer spending, chalking the weakness up to weather instead of weaker fundamentals. The Nasdaq is up about 5.7 percent over the past six sessions, its best six-day advance since December 2011. Both the Dow and S&P; 500 rose for the fifth session out of the last six. Indexes opened lower but gained throughout the session, although Cisco Systems (CSCO.O), which sank after warning about a slump in revenue, limited the Dow’s advance. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week while January retail sales fell and December retail sales were revised lower. “Investors have restored some enthusiasm for equities that was lost in the first few weeks of the year, and with weather seeming to be such a factor, they’re able to shrug this off,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. Dow component Cisco fell 2.5 percent to $22.27 as one of the biggest drags on all three major U.S. indexes. The network-gear maker forecast a 6 to 8 percent drop in revenue in the current quarter. “Cisco has been having problems with competition, so I don’t view that as indicative of tech in the aggregate or consumer spending,” said Luschini, who helps oversee $63 billion in assets. “This is company-specific, which is allowing other tech to shrug off that outlook.” The S&P; tech sector .SPLRCT rose 0.9 percent, boosted by Facebook Inc (FB.O) and SanDisk Corp SNDK.O. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 63.65 points, or 0.40 percent, at 16,027.59. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 10.57 points, or 0.58 percent, at 1,829.83. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 39.38 points, or 0.94 percent, at 4,240.67. Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) said it would buy Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N for $45.2 billion in an all-stock deal that combines the two largest U.S. cable operators. Time Warner Cable shares rose 7 percent to $144.81 while Comcast shed 4.1 percent to $52.97. Shares of Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O), which had also pursued Time Warner Cable, fell 6.3 percent to $128.91.

405,CSCO,UPDATE 2-Cisco launches US$8bn bond deal,"By Danielle Robinson NEW YORK, Feb 24 (IFR) - Cisco Systems has launched an US$8 billion seven-tranche jumbo bond issue after being deluged with more than US$21 billion of orders for its first debt transaction in three years. The deal, led by Barclays, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan, is the biggest investment-grade bond of the year so far, and the second largest offering from a technology company, behind Apple’s US$17bn deal in 2013. Investors jumped at the chance to buy the bond, whose  proceeds will take out US$3.75bn of Cisco notes coming due this year. Cisco, which has suffered lacklustre earnings in recent quarters, was also generous with spread, especially for the short-dated maturities. “This deal looked particularly attractive at the front end,” said one investor who took part in the deal. “I’d say you are getting about 5-10bp of new issue concession for the three and five-year tranches, so I think there will be a good bid on the break.” The seven-tranche issue includes US$850 million of 18-month floating rate notes, launched at three-month Libor plus 5bp; US$2.4 billion of three-year fixed rate notes at Treasuries plus 40bp; US$1 billion of three-year floaters at three-month Libor plus 28bp; US$1.75 billion of five-year fixed rate securities at Treasuries plus 60bp; US$500 million of five-year floaters at three-month plus 50bp; US$500 million of seven-year notes at Treasuries plus 75bp and US$1 billion of 10-year securities at Treasuries plus 90bp. That compares with initial price thoughts of Libor plus 5-7bp on the 18-month FRN, T+45bp area on the three-year fixed, 3mL+33bp area on the three-year FRN, T+70bp area on the five-year fixed, 3mL+60bp area on the five-year FRN, T+95bp area on the seven-year fixed and T+105bp area on the 10-year fixed. Cisco, rated A1/AA-, is also expected to use the proceeds to beef up cash levels as it continues its aggressive program of returning capital to shareholders this year, including the repurchase of common stock and the payment of cash dividends. Citigroup, HSBC, and Wells Fargo are passives on the deal. Cisco spent US$4bn in its second fiscal quarter ending January 25 to buy back shares.",2242014,http://www.reuters.com/article/cisco-systems-bond/update-2-cisco-launches-us8bn-bond-deal-idUSL6N0LT2QP20140224

411,CSCO,U.S. tech giants' offshore cash piles earn interest from govt-report,"LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - Four of the biggest U.S. technology groups collectively hold an estimated $124 billion in U.S. Treasury debt, much of it offshore, earning them tax-free interest, the UK’s Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ) said on Thursday. The finding means Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp , Google Inc and Cisco Systems Inc  hold a large proportion of the $254.9 billion held in their foreign subsidiaries in U.S. Treasuries, according to securities filings reviewed by the London-based BIJ, a not-for-profit news organisation. Bringing the money home would trigger a tax bill, so the companies keep it offshore, partly to fund foreign expansion but also, executives say, to avoid a tax hit. Democratic party Senator Carl Levin, who has campaigned for years against tax avoidance, was quoted saying by the BIJ that if U.S. corporations invested offshore funds in U.S. government debt, this income should face U.S. taxes. “Those funds ought to be treated as having been repatriated and subject to U.S. tax,” Levin said. Corporations including Apple have lobbied for changes so they would not have to pay U.S. tax on income earned outside the United States and brought home. Many other countries, including Britain, only tax income earned within their borders, though some international companies have been accused of reducing their bill via sophisticated offshore accounting arrangements. Some U.S. companies say a “territorial” type of tax system would avoid double taxation and ensure all businesses compete on equal terms. Tax campaigners say it would encourage companies to shift profits overseas. Google said it responded to tax incentives offered by governments while following tax rules in every country where it operates. The other companies declined comment, but have previously said they pay all the tax they should.",3132014,http://www.reuters.com/article/tech-taxes/u-s-tech-giants-offshore-cash-piles-earn-interest-from-govt-report-idUSL6N0M939F20140313

Cisco said it will spend the amount to build data centers to help run the new service called Cisco Cloud Services. Cisco, which mainly deals in networking hardware, wants to take advantage of companies’ desire to rent computing services rather than buying and maintaining their own machines. The company said it plans to deliver the service with and through partners including Australian telecom service provider Telstra, tech distributor Ingram Micro Inc, and Indian IT company Wipro Ltd. “Customers, providers and channel partners ... want to rapidly deploy valuable enterprise-class cloud experiences for key customers — all while mitigating the risk of capital investment,” Rob Lloyd, Cisco’s president of development and sales, said in a statement. Cisco’s plans were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

422,CSCO,REFILE-Juniper Networks eyes sale of mobile security unit Pulse -sources,"(Fixes company’s name in fourth paragraph to Juniper from Jupiter.) By Nicola Leske and Greg Roumeliotis April 14 (Reuters) - Juniper Networks Inc, the network gear maker under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management Corp to restructure, is exploring a sale of its mobile security unit Junos Pulse, according to people familiar with the matter. The move follows an extensive review of Juniper’s enterprise businesses and could signal a willingness by the Sunnyvale, California-based company to shed more non-core assets, in line with recent calls by some of its activist shareholders. Juniper, the No 2 gear maker after Cisco Systems Inc , has hired investment bank UBS AG to help find a buyer for Junos Pulse, the people said. Junos Pulse offers a range of mobile security infrastructure products aimed at protecting corporate-owned mobile devices. Juniper has not sent detailed financial information on Junos Pulse to interested parties yet, but some of the sources said any deal will likely value Junos Pulse in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Juniper declined to comment while UBS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Juniper, which has a market capitalization of $11.5 billion, carried out a review of its enterprise-focused networking assets last year following an attempt in 2012 to shed some assets that handle networking for enterprise clients, Reuters reported at the time. Following the appointment of a new chief executive, ex-Barclays Chief Operations and Technology Officer Shaygan Kheradpir in January, a number of activist investors began buying shares in the company, sensing an opportunity to push for change. Elliot Management, as well as activist peer Jana Partners LLC, have since argued for the need to cut costs, streamline product offerings and return money to shareholders. In response, Juniper has laid out an operational plan that includes a stock buyback and dividend program. On April 2, it also said it would cut its global workforce by 6 percent. The company, founded by electrical engineer and computer scientist Pradeep Sindhu in 1996, has lost more than half its market value since peaking at $23.8 billion in 2011, as it suffered from reduced capital expenditure from its clients and failed to gain traction in the enterprise space.

435,CSCO,INSIGHT-From Russia with concern: Cisco's audits raised red flags about resellers,"(Updating with background on Cisco) By Marina Lopes and Aruna Viswanatha NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, May 14 (Reuters) - In a series of audits in 2009, Cisco Systems Inc found that much of the business between resellers of its products and a Russian state-owned telecommunications company, Svyazinvest, could not be verified because it was either “misrepresented” or documents were withheld by the resellers, according to an executive summary of the audits reviewed by Reuters. The June 2009 report on the audits, other internal Cisco documents, and interviews with two sources familiar with the situation, raise questions about whether the company knew what was happening to telecom equipment sales going through its resellers in Russia, as well as whether discounts were passed on to customers as planned. Cisco, like many Western companies, often relies on local resellers, or distributors, to sell its products in such countries. San Jose, California-based Cisco is currently conducting an investigation into allegations of possible violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The allegations concerned Cisco’s operations in Russia and certain of the Commonwealth of Independent States, and some resellers of its products, the company said in a filing on Feb. 20, without elaborating further. Cisco, which is one of the world’s largest telecom equipment companies, has not said whether the probe concerns one or both of the main parts of the law - the anti-bribery or the accounting provisions. Under the former, it is prohibited for American companies and persons to make corrupt payments to officials of foreign governments or state-controlled companies. Under the accounting provisions, companies must keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. “It’s is an ongoing investigation and we’re putting a lot of resources into making sure it is done right,” said Mark Chandler, Cisco’s general counsel, in a statement to Reuters. “We’re fully cooperating with and sharing the results with the SEC and the Justice Department. The outcome of the investigation isn’t determinable, but we don’t expect it to have any adverse material impact on Cisco.” Cisco, which has hired the law firm WilmerHale to do the internal probe, declined to be more specific about the investigation or to comment on the audits summary and other documents. A source familiar with the matter said that the DOJ and the SEC are carrying out their own investigations into Cisco’s behavior to see if it breached the FCPA. Often U.S. authorities will ask a company to carry out an internal investigation and determine any possible penalties based on the levels of thoroughness of the probe and the amount of cooperation they receive. According to a March 30 article on the online news website Buzzfeed.com, a whistleblower went to the SEC with the allegations last year. Whistleblowers can be eligible to receive up to 30 percent of fines a company pays to the DOJ and the SEC for FCPA breaches. The June 2009 audits summary shows that Cisco was having trouble knowing what happened to the product it was selling. Out of $23 million in sales bookings for Cisco’s telecom equipment destined for Svyazinvest during 2008-2009 that were examined in the audits, only $5 million, or 22 percent, “are likely to be ok,” the summary said. Those sales to Svyazinvest - which is now part of state-controlled Rostelecom - went through a company called Compulink. An opinion on almost two thirds of these bookings, or $14.7 million, “could not be rendered due to partner refusal to provide supporting documentation,” the summary said. Those sales were handled by a reseller called Step Logic Companies. And another $3.1 million, or 13 percent, through two firms - AKOM and Stins Coman  - were described as “misrepresented.” Some Stins Coman documents were classified as “falsified” in an accompanying table in the summary. A Rostelecom spokesman said that “we have not heard about such facts” and declined further comment. A Compulink spokeswoman said Cisco does not carry out audits of the company, while Stins Coman spokesperson Ida Gill said it has not had any contracts with Svyazinvest. Step Logic denied withholding audit documents from Cisco, according to Inna Ozerova, the firm’s marketing director. AKOM could not be located for comment. The summary of the audits and other documents do not allege that inappropriate payments were made. It is unclear whether the inability to verify the sales are part of the FCPA investigations by either the authorities or Cisco. The purpose of the audits was to increase the level of assurance about the “integrity” of orders that went through the resellers and the “appropriateness” of a 68 percent discount provided by Cisco on the sales the resellers reported they had made to Svyazinvest, according to the summary. The report does not reach a conclusion on what happened to the discount and whether it was allocated as Cisco wanted. A separate report of a meeting in February 2008 shows that after various costs - including tax and a margin for the reseller - Svyazinvest should have received 56 percentage points of the 68 percent discount, though that document said there was “a lack of clarity” about the final price it paid. One of the sources familiar with the transactions says that Svyazinvest appears to have paid full price for at least some Cisco equipment, raising questions about whether resellers offered or applied the discount. Three legal and compliance experts who have been briefed on the audits summary say one key question that Cisco is likely to  be trying to answer is where the 68 percent went. They said the other critical issue concerns the company’s records and controls. “The first thing it would trigger in my mind is ‘we have to know where our money is.’ We have people in our distribution system who are not giving us reports, and we have money in our transactions that does not seem to be visible to us,”  said Stephen Clayton, an attorney who was head of anti-corruption compliance at server maker Sun Microsystems before it was bought by Oracle Corp in 2010. “The most critical part of the FCPA is not bribery, it is that you are required by U.S. law as a public company to have accurate books and records and to have an adequate system of corporate controls,” Clayton added. In a guide to the FCPA published in November 2012, the SEC and the DOJ said that “unreasonably large discounts to third-party distributors” is a common red flag that might indicate there could be a violation of the law. “If people are unwilling to turn over documents or the ones they turn over on their face have been falsified, it raises numerous questions,” said Peter Bible, the chief risk officer at U.S. accounting firm EisnerAmper, and a former chief accountant at General Motors. Bible, who spent time in Russia when GM was setting up a joint venture about 10 years ago, said that documentation problems were common there. The summary contains a series of actions that it said were agreed to by Cisco’s Russia leadership team, including issuing warnings to some staff involved in the Svyazinvest business, terminating “Cisco partner status” for at least one reseller, and tightening controls. Bible said this seemed to signal that Cisco was at the time taking the correct steps to sort out the problem. Based on the summary, “they didn’t just sweep it under the rug,” he said. It is unclear whether Cisco followed through on all the actions outlined in the document. Cisco declined to comment. The size of the discount offered to the resellers does not seem to have been extraordinary for Russia. Another document reviewed by Reuters reported a “Customer/Key Partner” as saying that Cisco rivals, Juniper Networks and China’s Huawei Technologies Co offered higher discounts to distributors - 75 percent in Juniper’s case and 75-83 percent for Huawei.

436,CSCO,INSIGHT-From Russia with concern: Cisco's audits raised red flags about resellers,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, May 14 (Reuters) - In a series of audits in 2009, Cisco Systems Inc found that much of the business between resellers of its products and a Russian state-owned telecommunications company, Svyazinvest, could not be verified because it was either “misrepresented” or documents were withheld by the resellers, according to an executive summary of the audits reviewed by Reuters. The June 2009 report on the audits, other internal Cisco documents, and interviews with two sources familiar with the situation, raise questions about whether the company knew what was happening to telecom equipment sales going through its resellers in Russia, as well as whether discounts were passed on to customers as planned. Cisco, like many Western companies, often relies on local resellers, or distributors, to sell its products in such countries. Cisco is currently conducting an investigation into allegations of possible violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The allegations concerned Cisco’s operations in Russia and certain of the Commonwealth of Independent States, and some resellers of its products, the company said in a filing on Feb. 20, without elaborating further. Cisco has not said whether the probe concerns one or both of the main parts of the law - the anti-bribery or the accounting provisions. Under the former, it is prohibited for American companies and persons to make corrupt payments to officials of foreign governments or state-controlled companies. Under the accounting provisions, companies must keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. “It’s is an ongoing investigation and we’re putting a lot of resources into making sure it is done right,” said Mark Chandler, Cisco’s general counsel, in a statement to Reuters. “We’re fully cooperating with and sharing the results with the SEC and the Justice Department. The outcome of the investigation isn’t determinable, but we don’t expect it to have any adverse material impact on Cisco.” Cisco, which has hired the law firm WilmerHale to do the internal probe, declined to be more specific about the investigation or to comment on the audits summary and other documents. A source familiar with the matter said that the DOJ and the SEC are carrying out their own investigations into Cisco’s behavior to see if it breached the FCPA. Often U.S. authorities will ask a company to carry out an internal investigation and determine any possible penalties based on the levels of thoroughness of the probe and the amount of cooperation they receive. According to a March 30 article on the online news website Buzzfeed.com, a whistleblower went to the SEC with the allegations last year. Whistleblowers can be eligible to receive up to 30 percent of fines a company pays to the DOJ and the SEC for FCPA breaches. The June 2009 audits summary shows that Cisco was having trouble knowing what happened to the product it was selling. Out of $23 million in sales bookings for Cisco’s telecom equipment destined for Svyazinvest during 2008-2009 that were examined in the audits, only $5 million, or 22 percent, “are likely to be ok,” the summary said. Those sales to Svyazinvest - which is now part of state-controlled Rostelecom - went through a company called Compulink. An opinion on almost two thirds of these bookings, or $14.7 million, “could not be rendered due to partner refusal to provide supporting documentation,” the summary said. Those sales were handled by a reseller called Step Logic Companies. And another $3.1 million, or 13 percent, through two firms - AKOM and Stins Coman  - were described as “misrepresented.” Some Stins Coman documents were classified as “falsified” in an accompanying table in the summary. A Rostelecom spokesman said that “we have not heard about such facts” and declined further comment. A Compulink spokeswoman said Cisco does not carry out audits of the company, while Stins Coman spokesperson Ida Gill said it has not had any contracts with Svyazinvest. Step Logic denied withholding audit documents from Cisco, according to Inna Ozerova, the firm’s marketing director. AKOM could not be located for comment. The summary of the audits and other documents do not allege that inappropriate payments were made. It is unclear whether the inability to verify the sales are part of the FCPA investigations by either the authorities or Cisco. The purpose of the audits was to increase the level of assurance about the “integrity” of orders that went through the resellers and the “appropriateness” of a 68 percent discount provided by Cisco on the sales the resellers reported they had made to Svyazinvest, according to the summary. The report does not reach a conclusion on what happened to the discount and whether it was allocated as Cisco wanted. A separate report of a meeting in February 2008 shows that after various costs - including tax and a margin for the reseller - Svyazinvest should have received 56 percentage points of the 68 percent discount, though that document said there was “a lack of clarity” about the final price it paid. One of the sources familiar with the transactions says that Svyazinvest appears to have paid full price for at least some Cisco equipment, raising questions about whether resellers offered or applied the discount. Three legal and compliance experts who have been briefed on the audits summary say one key question that Cisco is likely to  be trying to answer is where the 68 percent went. They said the other critical issue concerns the company’s records and controls. “The first thing it would trigger in my mind is ‘we have to know where our money is.’ We have people in our distribution system who are not giving us reports, and we have money in our transactions that does not seem to be visible to us,”  said Stephen Clayton, an attorney who was head of anti-corruption compliance at server maker Sun Microsystems before it was bought by Oracle Corp in 2010. “The most critical part of the FCPA is not bribery, it is that you are required by U.S. law as a public company to have accurate books and records and to have an adequate system of corporate controls,” Clayton added. In a guide to the FCPA published in November 2012, the SEC and the DOJ said that “unreasonably large discounts to third-party distributors” is a common red flag that might indicate there could be a violation of the law. “If people are unwilling to turn over documents or the ones they turn over on their face have been falsified, it raises numerous questions,” said Peter Bible, the chief risk officer at U.S. accounting firm EisnerAmper, and a former chief accountant at General Motors. Bible, who spent time in Russia when GM was setting up a joint venture about 10 years ago, said that documentation problems were common there. The summary contains a series of actions that it said were agreed to by Cisco’s Russia leadership team, including issuing warnings to some staff involved in the Svyazinvest business, terminating “Cisco partner status” for at least one reseller, and tightening controls. Bible said this seemed to signal that Cisco was at the time taking the correct steps to sort out the problem. Based on the summary, “they didn’t just sweep it under the rug,” he said. It is unclear whether Cisco followed through on all the actions outlined in the document. Cisco declined to comment. The size of the discount offered to the resellers does not seem to have been extraordinary for Russia. Another document reviewed by Reuters reported a “Customer/Key Partner” as saying that Cisco rivals, Juniper Networks and China’s Huawei Technologies Co offered higher discounts to distributors - 75 percent in Juniper’s case and 75-83 percent for Huawei. In August 2013, Juniper said that the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC were conducting investigations into possible violations by the company of the FCPA, though it did not mention any specific countries. In a statement to Reuters, Juniper said it didn’t comment on reseller prices or the terms it gave them. “We cannot comment on the specifics of the SEC’s investigation, however, we are cooperating with the investigation.” Huawei declined to comment and said it does not disclose details about commercial arrangements.

At least 18 brokerages raised their price targets on the company’s stock, with Cowen & Co raising it to $30. Cisco’s shares rose to an eight-month high of $24.69 in early trade on Thursday. Chief Executive John Chambers said on Wednesday that the company’s book-to-bill ratio, the proportion of orders received to units shipped and billed, was “comfortably above one,” indicating strong demand. “A surprising reversal in product orders suggests the worst is now behind Cisco,” Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brent Bracelin wrote in a post-earnings note to clients. “The biggest surprise was the rebound in Europe,” he said. Cisco’s key server business has grappled with competition from the so-called software-defined networks, which offer software that can run on cheaper hardware. However, recently the company is gaining some traction in that battle due to its Nexus 9000 switches, which can adapt to flows in workloads brought on by cloud computing and big data. Sterne Agee analyst Alex Kurtz said a 7 percent growth in U.S. orders highlighted the company’s ability to execute in the data center market and helped the company gain market share for the 17th consecutive quarter. Cisco’ shares were up 6.8 percent at $24.39 in midday trading on the Nasdaq. The stock gained 8 percent over the last year to Wednesday’s close.

444,CSCO,"China state media calls for 'severe punishment' for Google, Apple, U.S. tech firms","BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese state media lashed out at Google Inc GOOGL.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O and other U.S. technology companies on Wednesday, calling on Beijing “to punish severely the pawns” of the U.S. government for monitoring China and stealing secrets. U.S. companies such as Yahoo Inc YHOO.O, Cisco Systems Inc CSCO.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Facebook Inc FB.O threaten the cyber-security of China and its Internet users, said the People’s Daily on its microblog, in comments echoed on the front page of the English-language China Daily. It is not clear what sparked this latest round of vitriol, nor what information the U.S. firms are alleged to have stolen. But Chinese media have repeatedly attacked American tech companies for aiding the U.S. government’s cyber espionage since U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden revealed widespread spying programs including PRISM. Under PRISM, the NSA seized data from companies such as Google and Apple, according to revelations made by Snowden a year ago. Chinese state-owned firms have since begun dispensing with the services of U.S. companies such as IBM Corp IBM.N, Oracle Corp ORCL.N and Cisco in favor of domestic technology. As a result, Snowden’s revelations may cost U.S. companies billions of dollars, analysts say. “U.S. companies including Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc. are all coordinating with the PRISM program to monitor China,” the People’s Daily said on its official microblog. “To resist the naked Internet hegemony, we will draw up international regulations, and strengthen technology safeguards, but we will also severely punish the pawns of the villain. The priority is strengthening penalties and punishments, and for anyone who steals our information, even though they are far away, we shall punish them!” it said. Google has already had problems in China this week. On Monday, a China censorship watchdog said Google services were being disrupted ahead of Wednesday’s 25th anniversary of the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. (Full Story) “We cannot say this more clearly - the (U.S.) government does not have access to Google servers - not directly, or via a back door, or a so-called drop box,” said Google Chief Legal Officer David Drummond in an emailed statement on Wednesday. “We provide user data to governments only in accordance with the law.” Microsoft declined to provide immediate comment. Facebook, Yahoo and Cisco were not immediately available when Reuters sought comment. All of them have previously denied participating in sweeping surveillance efforts. Apple on Wednesday referred to its previous statements on the matter. “Much of what has been said isn’t true. There is no back door. The government doesn’t have access to our servers. They would have to cart us out in a box for that,” Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in an April interview with ABC Television. Facebook is currently blocked by Chinese censors but said last month it may open a sales office in China to provide more support to local advertisers who use the website to reach customers overseas. (Full Story) In December, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Yahoo and other Internet companies issued an open letter to U.S. President Barack Obama and Congress to reform and introduce restrictions on surveillance activities.

Just last month, central government offices were banned from installing Windows 8, Microsoft’s latest operating system, on new computers.

The indictment sparked outrage in China and added urgency to Beijing’s efforts to promote the development of local information technology (IT) companies. Chinese media called the United States “a high-level hooligan” and officials accused Washington of applying “double standards” on issues of cyber spying. After the charges were announced, China said it will investigate providers of important IT products and services to protect “national security” and “economic and social development.” (Full Story) ",6042014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-usa-tech/china-state-media-calls-for-severe-punishment-for-google-apple-u-s-tech-firms-idUSKBN0EF0CA20140604

Baucus’ remarks come as commercial ties between the world’s two largest economies have been strained over cyber espionage charges and revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden of U.S. spying. In May, Washington indicted five Chinese military officers for hacking U.S. companies, prompting Beijing to suspend a Sino-U.S. working group on cyber issues. It adamantly denies the charges. Such behaviour is criminal and runs counter to China’s World Trade Organization commitments, Baucus told business leaders at an American Chamber of Commerce in China luncheon two weeks ahead of annual high-level bilateral talks in Beijing. “Cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets by state actors in China has emerged as a major threat to our economic, and thus, national security,” Baucus said. “We won’t sit idly by when a crime is committed in the real world. So why should we when it happens in cyber space?” he said. “We will continue to use diplomatic and legal means to make clear that this type of behaviour must stop.” Tensions over cyber security rose in late 2012 after Washington banned Chinese communications equipment makers Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE Corp from building U.S. telecoms infrastructure. Beijing responded by pressuring big state-owned firms to stop buying U.S.-made hardware, emphasising security risks following Snowden’s revelations, people in the industry said. U.S. equipment and software providers such as IBM Corp  and Cisco Systems Inc have already seen their China sales drop after the Snowden leaks. Like a string of ambassadors before him, Baucus, a former Montana senator who arrived in Beijing in March, has made it his immediate priority to boost the two countries’ commercial and economic links. He has stressed that stronger economic ties will help resolve a host of thorny political and security challenges. Baucus said a bilateral investment treaty would help China rebalance its economy by opening up its service industries to more foreign investment and that moving forward negotiations would be among his top priorities as ambassador. “I believe that the U.S.-China bilateral investment treaty ... today could do for China’s investment regime what the WTO accession did 15 years ago,” Baucus said. The investment treaty talks, which were launched in 2008, will likely be at the centre of the Strategic & Economic Dialogue that will bring U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew to Beijing in July. Disputes over cyber security topped the agenda at last year’s meeting, initiated in 2008 to help manage a relationship that is growing more complex with China’s emergence as major economic and military power. However, the annual talks have yielded few substantive agreements. Lew has said he will push China to speed up economic reforms and do more to allow markets to determine the value of its yuan currency. Washington’s aim for the investment treaty is to loosen Beijing’s restrictions in key sectors from service industries to agriculture, and ensure that foreign companies receive treatment equal to Chinese private and state-owned enterprises. China heavily restricts dozens of industries and U.S. firms have long complained they are forced to meet unfair burdens such as ownership caps and are pressured to transfer technology in exchange for market access.

448,CSCO,"UPDATE 1-Symantec, Kaspersky downplay Beijing effort to exclude products","(Adds Kaspersky and analysts’ comments) By Soham Chatterjee and Jim Finkle Aug 4 (Reuters) - U.S. security software maker Symantec Corp  and Russia’s Kaspersky Lab downplayed a move by Beijing to exclude them from a list of anti-virus vendors whose products are approved for sale to central government agencies in China. The People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party, said on its English Twitter feed on Sunday that the government’s procurement agency has excluded Symantec and Kaspersky from a list of security software suppliers. Kaspersky confirmed on Monday that authorities in Beijing had moved to restrict government purchases of software from non-Chinese companies. “Chinese Central Government Procurement Center temporarily rescinded its endorsements of all foreign security providers,” Kaspersky spokeswoman Susan Rivera said. “However, this restriction only applies to national-level institutions whose funding comes from the central government procurement budget, and does not include regional governments or large enterprises.” Symantec said in a statement that the list referred to in Chinese media reports only affected some types of products. “It is important to note that this list is only for certain types of procurement and Symantec products are not banned by the Chinese government,” the statement said.  “We are investigating this report and will continue to bid for and win government projects in China.” Shares of Symantec closed up 1.7 percent at $23.56 on the Nasdaq on Monday. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.72 percent. The People’s Daily also tweeted that it had approved the use of five Chinese anti-virus software vendors: Qihoo 360 Technology Co, Venustech, CAJinchen, Beijing Jiangmin and Rising. FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said he sees the development becoming a more contentious issue over the coming months. “It’s another headwind for the company as Symantec already faces numerous challenges to show growth again. China remains a headache situation for Symantec as well as other U.S. tech providers across the board.” Ives said. Symantec said last month it was in talks with Chinese authorities following reports that China had banned use of one of its products, data loss prevention software. Sunday’s report is the latest sign that Beijing is intent on promoting use of domestic information technology amid concerns about U.S. spying and the indictment of five Chinese military officers on cyber espionage charges. Still, Eric Johnson, dean of the business school at Vanderbilt University and an expert on cyber security issues, said the Chinese government’s move is only a “symbolic one” and will have “little meaningful impact” on Symantec. Chinese technology corporations like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE Corp have grown into sophisticated global conglomerates in past years, and some analysts speculate that Beijing is promoting its local industry standard-bearers on its own home turf at the expense of U.S. corporations. Chinese state media have lashed out at Google Inc, Apple Inc and other U.S. technology companies, calling on Beijing “to punish severely the pawns” of the U.S. government for monitoring China and stealing secrets. U.S. tech companies such as Microsoft Corp and Qualcomm Inc have recently faced anti-trust investigations, while IBM Corp and Cisco Systems Inc  have reported declining sales in China.

449,CSCO,"Cisco to cut another 6,000 jobs as forecast falls flat","(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) forecast tepid current-quarter results and said it plans to cut another 6,000 jobs, as the network equipment maker works through a transition toward a new cycle of high-end switches and routers. The latest round of layoffs is at least the third workforce reduction in about as many years for a company once synonymous with the Internet boom, but which has lately struggled to sustain growth. The company announced in August 2013 that it would cut 4,000 jobs. And in 2011, it said it planned to reduce its workforce by more than 11,000. Shares in the company slipped 0.95 percent to $24.96 in extended trading, from a $25.20 close on the Nasdaq.  “The market doesn’t wait for anyone. We are going to lead it, period,” Chief Executive Officer John Chambers told analysts on a conference call. “The ability to do that requires some tough decisions. We will manage our costs aggressively and drive efficiencies.”  Chambers partly blamed the cuts on the uncertainty in global demand. In emerging markets, where the company faces sluggish sales and increased competition, Cisco saw continued challenges. China product orders fell 23 percent, and Brazil had 13 percent declines.  “Unfortunately, as we look out, we don’t see emerging markets growth returning for several quarters and believe it could get worse,” said Chambers. Total product orders rose 1 percent, with 2 percent growth in both the Americas and Europe, the Middle East and Africa, offset by a 7 percent decline in Asia and Pacific.  “The mixed quarter has become the norm for Cisco,” said  Zeus Kerravalla at ZK research. “As the market transitions, your staff has to transition. I see a lot of what they are doing as a reallocation and I think it is the right thing for the company.”  Cisco’s high-end routers and switches declined 7 percent and 4 percent year-over-year, respectively, as customers were slow to order a new series of products. Its data center revenues rose 30 percent, and security sector revenues rose 29 percent.  Security revenue was boosted by the acquisition of SourceFire, a cyber security firm Cisco acquired in October 2013.  Cisco also forecast earnings per share of between 51 cents and 53 cents for its current, fiscal first quarter. It predicted flat to 1 percent growth in revenue for the period. Cisco posted a smaller-than-expected 0.5 percent dip in fiscal fourth-quarter revenue to $12.4 billion. Wall Street on average had expected $12.1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That beat the company’s previous guidance for a decline in revenue of between 1 percent and 3 percent for the quarter.  Cisco reported a net profit of $2.8 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, flat from the year-ago quarter and adjusted earnings of 55 cents per share. That exceeded the consensus forecast of 53 cents.

452,CSCO,Cisco to take $700 million in restructuring charges for layoffs,"(Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc said on Thursday its plan to slash 6,000 jobs will result in restructuring charges of $700 million in cash in the year ending July 2015.   The latest round of layoffs, announced on Wednesday, is at least the fourth workforce reduction in about as many years for a company once synonymous with the Internet boom and could spark a shakeup in management, analysts said.  Shares in Cisco, still the world’s largest networking equipment maker, were down 2.7 percent at $24.52 on the Nasdaq. Cisco has failed to sustain growth in its high-end switches and routers business and is grappling with competition from so-called software-defined networks (SDN) which offer software that can run on cheap hardware.  The company will recognize $250 million to $350 million of the charges in the first quarter, it said in a regulatory filing. John Chambers, Cisco’s veteran chief executive, blamed the cuts on global uncertainty and said he will use the savings to reinvest in profitable sectors like cloud computing and security. While the company has cut over 17,000 in the past four years, acquisitions have helped its headcount grow to around 74,000 from 71,000 in 2011, according to Cisco’s regulatory  filings.  “He is right-sizing Cisco and trying to get some strategic changes put in place. In the interim he has got to maintain his margins,” said Ken Dulaney, analyst at Gartner.  The cuts could put pressure on 64-year-old Chambers to retire. The CEO has led the company for nearly 20 years and in 2012 said he would look to retire in two to four years. But Chambers is unlikely to leave before he is ready. According to Dulaney, Cisco’s board is loyal to Chambers, who joined the company as senior vice president in 1991 and helped it grow into a $128 billion operation, one of the most valuable tech companies in the world. Still the announcement, which made Cisco the biggest decliner on the S&P; 500 on Thursday, could cause a shake up at the company.  “A lot of his software investments have not panned out. He has got to get back to his core business and do greater things. That will happen if he gets new management under him,” said Dulaney.  Cisco is also battling sluggish sales and increased competition in emerging markets. The company’s rivals include Juniper Networks Inc and China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL]. Cisco said on Wednesday that sales fell 23 percent in China and 13 percent in Brazil in the fourth quarter ended July 26. The company also reported flat profit for the fourth quarter and forecast tepid first-quarter profit and revenue.

Addressing Russian ministers and members of parliament in Crimea, Putin said Russia would stand up for itself but not at the cost of confrontation with the outside world, a conciliatory note after months of tough rhetoric over the crisis in Ukraine. Trading has largely been driven by uncertainty over the conflict between Russia and Ukraine of late, with many traders concerned about the potential fallout of any dramatic escalation. “The situation in Ukraine will only become a problem if it gets much worse, and right now it doesn’t seem like that’s going to be the case, which is helping the market hang in there,” said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago. “That said, Europe remains a really big problem and it is another signal that global GDP isn’t picking up.” The latest data out of Europe showed the euro zone’s economy ground to a halt in the second quarter, with Germany - the largest euro zone economy - unexpectedly contracting in the quarter.

459,CSCO,Cisco to take $700 mln in restructuring charges in 2015,"Aug 14 (Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc  said it would take restructuring charges of $700 million in cash in the year ending July 2015 related to its plan to cut 6,000 jobs. The latest round of layoffs is at least the third workforce reduction in about as many years for a company once synonymous with the Internet boom. The company has failed to sustain growth in its high-end switches and routers business. Cisco said $250-$350 million of the charges would be recognized in the first quarter. The company on Wednesday reported flat profit for the fourth quarter ended July 26 and forecast tepid first-quarter profit and revenue.

460,CSCO,"Tech, equipment makers join U.S. 'net neutrality' debate","LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Regulating internet providers more like public utility companies could hurt the Internet and the U.S. economy, more than two dozen network technology and equipment makers have told U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker. Thirty-three companies including Cisco Systems Inc, Intel Corp and International Business Machines Corp joined the chorus of citizens, activists, lawmakers and companies debating how the U.S. government should regulate Internet service providers (ISPs). Other companies signing a letter to Pritzker published on Tuesday included Alcatel Lucent SA, Ericsson, Nokia Oyj’s network arm NSN, Panasonic Corp of North America and CommScope Holding Co Inc. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is considering so-called “net neutrality” rules that would determine how ISPs such as Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc manage web traffic on their networks. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has proposed rules that would allow ISPs to charge content companies to ensure their websites or applications load smoothly and quickly, as long as such deals are deemed “commercially reasonable.”  Critics, including popular video streaming service Netflix Corp and numerous advocacy groups, argue the plan would threaten less deep-pocketed content providers by potentially relegating them to “slow lanes” on the web. Instead, they call on the FCC to reclassify broadband as a telecommunication service rather than the less-regulated information service it is now, saying the move would give more power to the FCC to stop potential violators of net neutrality. ISPs and Republicans, both in Congress and at the FCC, have rejected the idea.  On Tuesday, 33 telecom network and tech makers, who are members of the Telecommunications Industry Association and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association and who depend on ISPs for business, spoke out against the reclassification idea as well. “A sudden shift from the existing light-touch approach – which has been an unqualified success and the basis for billions of dollars in investments – to the prescriptive regime of Title II would be extremely disruptive to the broadband marketplace,” they wrote, referring to the legal authority the FCC would use to reclassify ISPs. Experts have disagreed on whether or how reclassification would adequately prevent pay-for-priority deals.  Wheeler has not proposed reclassification as the solution, but has not taken it off the table as a potential option. FCC is collecting public comment on the tentatively proposed rules until Sept. 15 and will hold several public workshops on various aspects of the regulations in the following weeks. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy will hold a hearing on the issue of net neutrality on Sept. 17.

461,CSCO,"For U.S. tech firms, China entices in spite of tight state control","TIANJIN, CHINA Sept 12 (Reuters) - The sheer size of the Chinese market is so alluring to Western companies that even pro-internet freedom firms like CloudFlare may have to put moral outrage to the side in their pursuit of new business. San Francisco-based CloudFlare has a policy of providing cyber-defence services for all, based on a belief that the internet should be free, decentralised and open. Its clients have included groups that the U.S. government regards as terrorist organisations. Those values may now have to be shelved when it comes to entering China, where state control of the internet is among the world’s tightest. CloudFlare is looking for a Chinese partner and aims to be in the country by 2015, said co-founder Michelle Zatlyn on the sidelines of a World Economic Forum meeting in the northern city of Tianjin this week. “As we think about international expansion it’s vital that we get China,” said Zatlyn of CloudFlare’s second-largest market by user traffic. “There are rules and regulation which operate within the country. As a U.S. company we absolutely have to follow those, and we’re okay with that.” The operating environment in China may be even tougher now. U.S. businesses have complained about Chinese protectionism, and American tech firms have repeatedly come under fire from the state since last year’s U.S. National Security Agency cyber espionage revelations. Microsoft Corp and Qualcomm Inc are being investigated for anti-trust violations, while IBM Corp, Intel Corp and Cisco Systems Inc have seen sales in China plummet in recent quarters. CloudFlare is joining a long list of companies, from firms that have seen little or no success in China like Yahoo Inc , eBay Inc, Google Inc and Facebook Inc  to recent entrants like LinkedIn Corp, for whom China’s pull as the world’s largest internet market by population has been too strong to resist. CloudFlare is hoping to learn from the lessons of the U.S. tech sector’s fallen soldiers in China. One of these came at the World Economic Forum, where Lu Wei, the director of China’s State Internet Information Office, said Facebook will be unable to access China any time soon, according to state media. “You have to play a slightly long game if you’re a Western multi-national company in China,” said Mark Spelman, a managing director at Accenture PLC. “It’s very important to think about which Chinese partners you should be working with, and organisations need to think very  carefully about what business model you need in China - it might not be the same as in other countries,” he cautioned.

Baker NEW YORK, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Cisco Chief Executive Officer John Chambers on Wednesday said the networking company was not among the potential suitors for data storage products maker EMC Corp, which the Wall Street Journal has said is exploring options that include a sale. Chambers, speaking at a Wall Street Journal breakfast, said he usually avoided commenting on potential deals but would make an exception in this case. Cisco typically gets “the opportunity for almost every move in the industry” in terms of potential deals, he added. “If Joe and I were going to do something here we would have done it a year or two ago,” he said, referring to EMC CEO Joe Tucci, who is expected to retire in February. EMC has held merger talks with Hewlett-Packard Co  that have since ended and are unlikely to resume, according to people familiar with the matter. No talks are under way between EMC and any other big technology companies with the firepower to make a sizeable acquisition, including Oracle Corp, Dell Inc  and Cisco, the people said. People with knowledge of the approaches say Elliott Management, an activist investor in EMC, has spoken to various technology companies, including Dell, Cisco and Oracle, to discuss various options, including a sale. The people said those companies were not interested in those options at this time. EMC, which has a market capitalization of nearly $61 billion, has rebuffed pressure from Elliott to spin off software maker VMware Inc, a person familiar with the situation told Reuters earlier this month. Shares of EMC were down 0.6 percent at $29.66 in late-morning trading, while Cisco rose 0.7 percent to $24.88.

466,CSCO,UPDATE 1-Palo Alto Networks unexpectedly gets low score on firewall test,"(Adds comment from NSS, analysts. Palo Alto declined comment) By Jim Finkle BOSTON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Palo Alto Networks Inc’s  flagship next-generation security firewall ranks as the least effective in a new test of such equipment by NSS Labs, results that surprised some analysts because the product is widely considered an industry leader. NSS, which reviews technology products for Fortune 500 companies, gave Palo Alto’s firewall a “caution” rating in a survey released to clients Tuesday. It had rated the product “recommended” in its last survey, released in February 2013. NSS recommended rival firewalls from Check Point Software Technologies Ltd, Cisco Systems Inc, Dell Inc , Fortinet Inc, Intel Corp’s McAfee division and WatchGuard. A Palo Alto Networks representative declined comment. NSS Chief Executive Officer Vikram Phatak said that Palo Alto had issued two major revisions to its firewall operating system since the last test. “They broke something in the process,” he said. NSS marked down Palo Alto heavily for failing key tests that determine how easily hackers could evade a firewall’s security, Phatak said. “They have a fundamental problem in how they are handling TCP/IP traffic, which is the foundation of the Internet,” he said. Greg Young, an analyst with Gartner which closely follows the next-generation firewall market, said he was surprised by the results. “Generally NSS stuff has been pretty good, but I need more information to help me understand this one,” he said. “I have a lot of questions about the placement. They are really sort of divergent from where we placed the products.” The findings come in the wake of a controversial report released by NSS in April that said FireEye Inc’s breach detection system did not work as well as products from rivals including Cisco and Trend Micro. FireEye disputed those claims but shares in the company that went public in one of last year’s hottest IPO dropped significantly in the weeks after the report’s publication. Securosis analyst Mike Rothman, who advises businesses in selecting firewalls, said that buyers often review NSS surveys when picking products. Yet he said laboratory tests may not be as relevant as they used to be because security has become extremely complex, making it difficult for a test like the one released this week by NSS to be a good indicator of how a product will work for any particular company. “As security has gotten a lot more complicated, it is not as easy to set up a generic test bed and have the results replicated in the real world,” he said. Rothman said that businesses need to come up with a “short list” of several products that look like they will meet their needs, and then ask the manufacturers to lend them the equipment for a trial. “You’ve got to test them out in your environment,” he said. NSS also gave “neutral” ratings to firewall models from Barracuda Networks Inc, Cisco and Sophos Cyberoam.

Intercloud will also allow companies to direct data traffic through specific clouds and data centers.

475,CSCO,"Weak telecom spending, emerging markets weigh on Cisco forecast","(Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc forecast current-quarter profit below analysts’ average estimate, weighed down by capital budget cuts at telecom service providers and weak sales in emerging markets. Cisco’s shares reversed course in extended trading following the forecast and fell 1 percent.

483,CSCO,UPDATE 1-U.S. Supreme Court agrees to hear Cisco patent infringement case,"(Adds details, background) By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to review a patent infringement case involving Cisco Systems Inc that could have broad impact on companies’ ability to defend themselves from similar litigation. The court said it will consider an earlier ruling by an appeals court that threw out a $64-million patent infringement verdict won by Commil USA, LLC against Cisco. The justices will hear patent holder Commil’s appeal over whether the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was correct to throw out the verdict and order a new trial. The case concerns a patent held by Commil on a way to improve the implementation of a wireless network where multiple access points are needed. Commil sued Cisco for patent infringement and induced patent infringement based on the network equipment maker’s use of similar technology. In April 2011 a jury awarded Commil almost $63.8 million in damages. A judge subsequently added $10.3 million in interest. In June 2013, the appeals court ordered a retrial, concluding that Cisco should be allowed to mount a defense to the induced infringement claim on the basis that it had a good faith belief that the Commil patent was invalid when it sold its products to customers. A 2010 jury had concluded the patent was valid. In a brief filed at the invitation of the high court, the U.S. government warned that companies accused of inducing patent infringement are likely to raise the “good faith” defense in most cases, if not all of them. The brief court order noted that Justice Stephen Breyer will not participate in the case. A ruling is due by the end of June. The case is Commil v. Cisco, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 13-896. Separately on Friday, Cisco filed two lawsuits against Arista Networks Inc, accusing the smaller rival of copying its networking technologies.    (Reporting by Lawrence Hurley.

488,CSCO,Internet firms push to be left out of EU cybersecurity law,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Internet companies like Cisco (CSCO.O) and Google (GOOGL.O) are seeking to be excluded from a new EU cybersecurity law that would force them to adopt tough security measures and report serious security breaches to national authorities. The so-called Network and Information Security directive is due to be finalised in talks between the European Parliament, the European Commission and member states over the coming weeks. EU lawmakers want the law to cover only sectors that they consider critical, such as energy, transport and finance.  But the Commission - the EU executive - and some countries, such as Germany and France, are pushing to include cloud providers, social networks, search engines and e-commerce platforms because of their widespread use by people and businesses. Internet companies are firmly opposed to such a move, which would incur extra compliance costs. “Online services such as e-commerce sites, search and social networks are useful but not critical. This legislation should focus on truly critical infrastructure only,” said James Waterworth, vice-president for Europe of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a lobbying group which includes Facebook (FB.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google. Such firms agree with lawmakers who say their inclusion would lead to duplicate incident reporting - for example when a bank using a cloud-computing provider suffers a security breach.  “We are implicated anyway with critical sectors as customers,” said Chris Gow, senior manager of government affairs at network equipment maker Cisco. Currently there is no pan-European law and only telecoms operators are subject to the incident-reporting requirements. The European Parliament also wants all companies within a sector to fall under the new law’s scope - but member states want the flexibility to pick and choose within sectors.

490,CSCO,Israel's Team8 attracts investment for cyber security firms,"* Raises $18 mln in initial funding round * Alcatel-Lucent, Cisco join as strategic partners * Firm led by veterans of Israeli military intelligence unit * Aims to build up to build up to 6 cyber security companies By Steven Scheer TEL AVIV, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Team8, an Israeli venture capital fund focused on the cyber-security industry, said on Tuesday it had raised $18 million in its first round of funding, including investment from Alcatel-Lucent and Cisco . Also participating in the round were Bessemer Venture Partners, Marker LLC and Innovation Endeavors, which was founded by Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt. Led by veterans of the Israeli army’s 8200 intelligence and electronic espionage unit, Team8 aims to develop cyber-security companies that offer more in-depth protection than the usual defence against hacking attempts by generic malware. Bessemer partner David Cowan said that could set them apart from the legions of security start-ups in Silicon Valley. “When you are being targeted by human-driven campaigns you need a much deeper skill set in cyber operations that you won’t find in Silicon Valley and is nearly impossible to find outside of criminal organisations and governments,” he told Reuters. Team8’s approach is “not going to be quick or cheap” since there is no silver bullet to solve the problem, he said. Team8 co-founder Nadav Zafrir, who spent 25 years at 8200 and 10 years running the unit, said he aims to build four to six companies in the next few years — each focusing on a specific domain such as cloud computing, industrial firms and enterprises. He described 2014 as a turning point for cyber security in the wake of attacks on retailer Target — in which up to 70 million customers had their personal information compromised - and Sony, and that a new approach was critical. To that end, Israel’s government has made cyber security a priority, in the hope of building on the country’s military-grade technology and innovation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu allocated 2 billion shekels ($515 million) in 2012 to set up a cyber security agency within his office and there are a range of venture funds based in southern Israel, where the army is moving its headquarters. Zafrir told Reuters the firms to be created would have to stay one step ahead of hackers, whom he divided into three segments: hard-core cyber criminals whose motivation was to make money through stolen credit cards and other financial information, state-sponsored attackers, and ideologists who hack for a cause. “If we don’t find cost-effective and efficient next generation solutions that will keep enterprises and industrial plants safe, there is a true challenge to prosperity to the global economy,” he said.

491,CSCO,Robust switching sales power strong quarter for Cisco,"(Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) reported stronger-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit as demand for switching equipment and routers helped to make up for weak spending by the company’s traditional telecom customers. Cisco, whose shares were up 5.6 percent in extended trading on Wednesday, has been trying to make a transition toward a new cycle of high-end switches and routers. The switching business, which makes products that handle traffic at large internet data centers, brought in about 39 percent of Cisco’s total hardware revenue in 2014, while the router business accounted for about 21.2 percent. “They are seeing very robust switching sales,” Needham & Co analyst Alex Henderson told Reuters, adding that this was good news for others in the sector such as Infoblox Inc BLOX.N, Gigamon Inc GIMO.N and F5 Networks Inc (FFIV.O). Revenue from Cisco’s hardware business rose 7.8 percent to $9.08 billion in the company’s second quarter ended Jan. 24.  Revenue from services, which includes the company’s software and cloud offerings, rose 4.6 percent to $2.86 billion. Subscriptions generate more predictable recurring revenue than hardware sales. The services business is also less likely to suffer from sudden shifts in demand. “They may have the worst in the rear view right now,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Scott Thompson. The quarter showed the best balance of growth across all of the company’s geographies, products and segments, Chief Executive John Chambers said in a statement. Cisco, which raised its quarterly dividend by 2 cents to 21 cents, said its net profit rose to $2.4 billion, or 46 cents per share, in the quarter from $1.43 billion, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier.   Total revenue rose 7 percent to $11.94 billion. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 53 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 51 cents per share on revenue of $11.8 billion. Cisco forecast an adjusted profit of 51-53 cents per share for the current quarter, in line with analysts’ estimates. The company also forecast revenue growth of 3-5 percent.

The switching business, which makes products that handle traffic at large internet data centers, brought in about 39 percent of Cisco’s total hardware revenue in 2014, while the router business accounted for about 21.2 percent. “They are seeing very robust switching sales,” Needham & Co analyst Alex Henderson told Reuters, adding that this was good news for others in the sector such as Infoblox Inc BLOX.N, Gigamon Inc GIMO.N and F5 Networks Inc (FFIV.O). Revenue from Cisco’s hardware business rose 7.8 percent to $9.08 billion in the company’s second quarter ended Jan. 24.  Revenue from services, which includes the company’s software and cloud offerings, rose 4.6 percent to $2.86 billion. Subscriptions generate more predictable recurring revenue than hardware sales. The services business is also less likely to suffer from sudden shifts in demand. “They may have the worst in the rear view right now,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Scott Thompson. The quarter showed the best balance of growth across all of the company’s geographies, products and segments, Chief Executive John Chambers said in a statement. Cisco, which raised its quarterly dividend by 2 cents to 21 cents, said its net profit rose to $2.4 billion, or 46 cents per share, in the quarter from $1.43 billion, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier.   Total revenue rose 7 percent to $11.94 billion. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 53 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 51 cents per share on revenue of $11.8 billion. Cisco forecast an adjusted profit of 51-53 cents per share for the current quarter, in line with analysts’ estimates. Kramer added that while Cisco has made progress in the second quarter, the company will continue to be affected by headwinds from emerging markets and telecom service providers.  The company also forecast revenue growth of 3-5 percent. Cisco’s shares closed at $26.93 on the Nasdaq.

The Nasdaq composite index oscillated around the 5,000 milestone after hitting it in the morning for the first time since March 27, 2000, at the height of the dot.com bubble. It was boosted by chipmakers NXP Semiconductors NV, Intel Corp as well as network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc after two big deal announcements. Shares of chipmaker NXP rose 17 percent to $99.35 after it agreed to buy smaller peer Freescale Semiconductor Ltd  to create a company valued over $40 billion. Freescale rose 11.7 percent to $40.34. Hewlett-Packard Co said it would buy Wi-Fi gear maker Aruba Networks Inc for about $2.7 billion, the biggest deal for the world’s No. 2 PC maker since 2011. Rival Cisco rose as much as 2.7 percent to $30.31. “Today we’re getting the big boost because of the M&A; deals,” said Douglas Depietro, managing director at Evercore ISI in New York. “Going forward for the rest of the week, you may see a little pause because people are waiting for the economic data release Friday, because that may give an indication what the Fed’s going to do about interest rates.” U.S. consumer spending fell for a second month in January, with lower gasoline prices dampening inflation pressure while personal income fell just short of expectations, showing a rise of 0.3 percent. Separate gauges of manufacturing were conflicting, as financial data firm Markit’s final U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index hit a four-month high while a reading from the Institute for Supply Management fell to its lowest in 13 months. Construction spending also softened, falling at a 1.1 percent annual rate, below expectations calling for a 0.3 percent increase in January. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 124.27 points, or 0.69 percent, to 18,256.97, the S&P; 500 gained 9.84 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,114.34 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 35.38 points, or 0.71 percent, to 4,998.91. “Money is continuing to pour into the (equities) market because of low interest rates, and although stocks are somewhat expensive they’re not overly expensive,” said Stephen Massocca, chief investment officer at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. Lumber Liquidators plunged 22.3 percent to $40.28 after a news report said its products failed to meet safety standards, allegations the hardwood flooring retailer denied. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,698 to 1,344, for a 1.26-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,692 issues rose and 1,032 fell, for a 1.64-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.

507,CSCO,UPDATE 3-HP to buy Wi-Fi gear maker Aruba Networks for $2.7 bln,"* All-cash offer of $24.67/shr * HP’s biggest deal since Autonomy purchase in 2011 * Aruba shares fall 1.45 pct; HP marginally down   (Adds analysts’ comments, details) By Abhirup Roy March 2 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co said it would buy Wi-Fi network gear maker Aruba Networks Inc for about $2.7 billion, the biggest deal for the world’s No. 2 PC maker since its botched acquisition of Britain’s Autonomy Plc in 2011. HP has had a dismal record for big acquisitions, having written off multibillion-dollar acquisitions of Autonomy and technology outsourcing provider EDS, which it bought in 2008. The purchase of Aruba would help HP boost its share in the wireless local area network (WLAN) market as more companies allow employees to access work systems through their wireless devices. “I think it will add a layer of high-growth revenue to the mix in a way it helps HP reach its goal of growing faster,” Atlantic Equities analyst Josep Bori told Reuters. HP is way behind market leader Cisco Systems Inc in the networking business, and the Aruba acquisition would help it to gain a little more market share, he said. HP has a 4-5 percent share of the enterprise WLAN market, compared with Aruba’s 10-13 percent, FBN Capital Markets analyst Shebly Seyrafi estimated in a note dated Feb. 27. The WLAN market is estimated to grow 40 percent to about $13 billion in 2019, according to market research firm Dell'Oro Group. (bit.ly/1F1eToD) HP, which has struggled to adapt to mobile and online computing, plans to separate its computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations this year. Aruba sells Wi-Fi gear to a wide range of clients including California State University and Dalian Wanda Group, which controls China’s biggest property developer and largest cinema chain. The purchase will also help HP better compete for E-Rate - the largest U.S. educational technology subsidy program - which helps connect schools and public libraries to high-speed Internet, JMP Securities analyst Erik Suppiger said. In December, the Federal Communications Commission voted to raise funding for the E-Rate program by $1.5 billion to $3.9 billion. The all-cash offer of $24.67 per share is a premium of 34.4 percent to Aruba’s close on Feb. 24, the day before Bloomberg reported about a possible deal. Aruba shares fell 1.6 percent to $24.41 in afternoon trading on Monday. The stock had risen about 40 percent since the Bloomberg report. HP shares were down marginally at $34.76. HP’s cash pile stood at $12.9 billion at the end of January. Evercore Partners and Catalyst Partners served as financial advisers to Aruba.

508,CSCO,Ericsson joins with Intel to help telecoms firms get in the cloud,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - Telecom equipment maker Ericsson and chipmaker Intel have agreed a partnership deal to help network operator customers build datacenters, putting them on a more competitive footing against big, cloud-based Internet firms such as Google, Facebook and Amazon. “We will build datacenter equipment which will actually have the same performance as many of the big cloud providers are doing for themselves,” Ericsson’s chief executive, Hans Vestberg, told a news conference at the Mobile World Congress telecoms trade show in Barcelona on Monday. Ericsson, the world’s leading maker of mobile network equipment, said it will help its global base of major telecoms companies to shift to cloud computing using Intel datacenter designs to compete more actively with Web rivals. No financial terms of the partnership were disclosed. Over the past decade Web-based services like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft have stopped buying finished computers, storage devices and network components and instead developed their own systems in-house to create massive, low-cost datacenters in the cloud to serve billions of users. Ericsson’s partnership with Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, puts it in a crowded market for providing bespoke datacenters, where it will also be competing with a range of technology suppliers including Cisco and IBM.  The Swedish company’s plan is to focus initially on equipping big telecom operators rather than competing for new corporate customers in other industries, its CEO said. Telecom operators are rushing to build datacenters in the cloud to slash the cost of hardware spending within their networks, improve the range of services they offer subscribers and to obtain the Web-wide reach of the big Internet companies. “The difference is that we are going to provide it to the market,” Vestberg said. “This is predominately to see that we give a competitive edge for our customers, the carriers.” The move builds on a number of smaller cloud software company acquisitions made by Ericsson over the past year.

510,CSCO,Cisco veteran Robbins to take over as CEO from Chambers,"(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc Chief Executive John Chambers will step down in July after 20 years at the helm of the network equipment maker, a symbol of the dot.com stock boom 15 years ago now struggling to boost its bottom line in the era of cloud computing. Company veteran Chuck Robbins, 49, will take over as CEO. The 65-year-old Chambers, one of the longest-serving leaders of a Silicon Valley company and also company chairman, will become executive chairman, the company said on Monday. Wall Street analysts said a change was expected and could signal a refocusing of Cisco, which acquired dozens of companies under Chambers but has failed to make great headway outside its core networking business.  “In many cases where the CEO has been very acquisitive, the next guy pares down and refocuses the company, and that is what I would be expecting with this change,” said Kim Forrest, an analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.  Robbins did not immediately indicate where that focus would be. “Over the next 90 days, I (would) actually like to listen,” he told reporters on a conference call. “The market is moving too rapidly for any one individual to think they have all the answers.” Shares of Cisco, based in San Jose, California with about 70,000 staff, were up 0.4 percent at $29.24 on Nasdaq. The company became a stock market sensation at the height of the technology boom in March 2000 when its market value passed $600 billion, based on the company’s diluted share count at the time, and briefly topped that of Microsoft Corp.  Chambers never managed to revive those glory days despite forays into consumer electronics and other areas. Cisco’s market value is now about $150 billion, and its annual operating profit is around where it was five years ago. It is expected to post sales of $49 billion this year.  Cisco said the timing of the announcement was not related to its quarterly earnings report, scheduled for May 13, and it did not alter its financial outlook. Chambers, a prominent Republican backer who was a co-chair for Senator John McCain’s 2008 bid for president, did not indicate any plans to go into politics. “I will probably support people (for) political office but probably not get involved myself,” he told reporters. Chambers said he started thinking about retiring as CEO about three years ago. He seemed relaxed and joked with longtime colleague Robbins during the call. “Chuck is just an execution machine,” said Chambers, using business jargon for someone who gets things done. Robbins joined Cisco in 1997 and became a board member on Friday. His latest role has been senior vice president of worldwide operations, running global sales for the company. Analysts hope Robbins’ elevation will mean a renewed focus on sales. “We like that Cisco is appointing someone as CEO that has a strong sales background, and we expect the employee base to be very supportive of the appointment,” said Tim Long, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Cisco has been looking for a new CEO for the past 16 months,  board member Roderick McGeary wrote in a company blog post detailing the hiring process. (bit.ly/1JLIPup) Some industry watchers were surprised at the choice. Rob Lloyd, Cisco’s director of development and sales, was more visible to investors, JMP Securities analyst Erik Suppiger said in an interview.  Chambers declined to name other potential candidates, or whether any such as Lloyd would stay at the company. Lloyd did not immediately return a request for comment.  Chambers is the second high-profile U.S. technology executive to step aside from the top job in the past eight months. In September, database software maker Oracle Corp’s CEO, Larry Ellison, announced his plan to become executive chairman.

514,CSCO,Cisco looks to salesman Robbins for tech leadership,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - Chuck Robbins, the veteran salesman chosen by Cisco Systems Inc to succeed legendary CEO John Chambers, must prove he has the technical knowledge to chart a new course and lead the network equipment maker into the new world of cloud-based computing.  Cisco, like tech stalwarts Hewlett-Packard Co and IBM, is trying to branch out from its core business into software, security and datacenters to capitalize on the explosion of remote computing.  “He’s going to run the company well as a caretaker, he’s got good business acumen, said Glenn O’Donnell, an analyst at tech research firm Forrester “The question is whether he has vision.  I don’t think anybody yet knows the answer.”  Cisco is the clear market leader in selling network equipment to companies, controlling about half of a $38 billion global market, more than four times the total of the next two rivals combined, HP and China’s Huawei, according to Gartner. The company is now trying to break away from being type-cast as just a network equipment supplier, laying its bets on what it calls the “Internet of Everything”, basically the recognition that soon almost every person, device, or sensor will feed data into a network. Cisco aims to play a role in analyzing and channeling that traffic in as many places as possible.  “They are making all this noise about the ‘Internet of Everything’. That’s a nice ambitious vision, but how can Cisco capitalize on that, and win in that marketplace?,” asked O’Donnell. Robbins, 49, gave no clear indication of his strategy during a conference call with reporters on Monday, saying he would rather listen to customers and shareholders for the next 90 days before laying out his plan. The CEO-in-waiting, who takes over in late July, made his name at Cisco building relationships with the legion of companies that actually sell Cisco’s products to large businesses, making up about 80 percent of Cisco’s $49 billion in expected revenue this fiscal year.  That makes Robbins, who holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics with a concentration in computer science from the University of North Carolina, a consummate salesman, like his predecessor. Chambers and Robbins, who joked together on a conference call earlier on Monday, are “cut of the same cloth”, said Tim Zimmerman, an analyst at Gartner. “He’s very sales focused, similar to John, and understands the voice of the customer,” he added.

515,CSCO,Cisco set to boost Internet speed for cable companies,"(Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc is set to launch a converged cable access platform, enabling cable operators offer download speeds of one gigabit a second or more. Cisco’s new cBR-8 system, to be unveiled on Tuesday, comes at a time when its rivals such as Arris Group Inc and Casa Systems Inc have started a new class of equipment that can deliver both video programing and broadband access to subscribers. The new system will “enable cable operators to achieve savings that could exceed 40 percent of capital and operating expenses over five years,” Cisco said in a statement. The news was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal. (on.wsj.com/1KIlA2f) Google Inc has been offering download speeds of one gigabit a second or more in some U.S. cities through fiberoptic networks.  By comparison, most U.S. cable users get peak speeds of less than 50 megabits, though services offering rates of up to 150 megabits are available in some areas, according to the Journal.

516,CSCO,Cisco veteran Robbins to take over as CEO from Chambers,"(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc Chief Executive John Chambers will step down in July after 20 years at the helm of the network equipment maker, a symbol of the dot.com stock boom 15 years ago now struggling to boost its bottom line in the era of cloud computing. Company veteran Chuck Robbins, 49, will take over as CEO. The 65-year-old Chambers, one of the longest-serving leaders of a Silicon Valley company and also company chairman, will become executive chairman, the company said on Monday. Wall Street analysts said a change was expected and could signal a refocusing of Cisco, which acquired dozens of companies under Chambers but has failed to make great headway outside its core networking business.  “In many cases where the CEO has been very acquisitive, the next guy pares down and refocuses the company, and that is what I would be expecting with this change,” said Kim Forrest, an analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.  Robbins did not immediately indicate where that focus would be. “Over the next 90 days, I (would) actually like to listen,” he told reporters on a conference call. “The market is moving too rapidly for any one individual to think they have all the answers.” Shares of Cisco, based in San Jose, California with about 70,000 staff, were up 0.4 percent at $29.24 on Nasdaq. The company became a stock market sensation at the height of the technology boom in March 2000 when its market value passed $600 billion, based on the company’s diluted share count at the time, and briefly topped that of Microsoft Corp.  Chambers never managed to revive those glory days despite forays into consumer electronics and other areas. Cisco’s market value is now about $150 billion, and its annual operating profit is around where it was five years ago. It is expected to post sales of $49 billion this year.  Cisco said the timing of the announcement was not related to its quarterly earnings report, scheduled for May 13, and it did not alter its financial outlook. Chambers, a prominent Republican backer who was a co-chair for Senator John McCain’s 2008 bid for president, did not indicate any plans to go into politics. “I will probably support people (for) political office but probably not get involved myself,” he told reporters. Chambers said he started thinking about retiring as CEO about three years ago. He seemed relaxed and joked with longtime colleague Robbins during the call. “Chuck is just an execution machine,” said Chambers, using business jargon for someone who gets things done. Robbins joined Cisco in 1997 and became a board member on Friday. His latest role has been senior vice president of worldwide operations, running global sales for the company. Analysts hope Robbins’ elevation will mean a renewed focus on sales. “We like that Cisco is appointing someone as CEO that has a strong sales background, and we expect the employee base to be very supportive of the appointment,” said Tim Long, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Cisco has been looking for a new CEO for the past 16 months,  board member Roderick McGeary wrote in a company blog post detailing the hiring process. (bit.ly/1JLIPup) Some industry watchers were surprised at the choice. Rob Lloyd, Cisco’s director of development and sales, was more visible to investors, JMP Securities analyst Erik Suppiger said in an interview.  Chambers declined to name other potential candidates, or whether any such as Lloyd would stay at the company. Lloyd did not immediately return a request for comment.  Chambers is the second high-profile U.S. technology executive to step aside from the top job in the past eight months. In September, database software maker Oracle Corp’s CEO, Larry Ellison, announced his plan to become executive chairman. Chambers has increased Cisco sales to about $48 billion from $1.2 billion since he became CEO in 1995.

517,CSCO,Cisco looks to salesman Robbins for tech leadership,"SEATTLE, May 4 (Reuters) - Chuck Robbins, the veteran salesman chosen by Cisco Systems Inc to succeed legendary CEO John Chambers, must prove he has the technical knowledge to chart a new course and lead the network equipment maker into the new world of cloud-based computing. Cisco, like tech stalwarts Hewlett-Packard Co and IBM, is trying to branch out from its core business into software, security and datacenters to capitalize on the explosion of remote computing. “He’s going to run the company well as a caretaker, he’s got good business acumen, said Glenn O’Donnell, an analyst at tech research firm Forrester “The question is whether he has vision.  I don’t think anybody yet knows the answer.” Cisco is the clear market leader in selling network equipment to companies, controlling about half of a $38 billion global market, more than four times the total of the next two rivals combined, HP and China’s Huawei, according to Gartner. The company is now trying to break away from being type-cast as just a network equipment supplier, laying its bets on what it calls the “Internet of Everything”, basically the recognition that soon almost every person, device, or sensor will feed data into a network. Cisco aims to play a role in analyzing and channeling that traffic in as many places as possible. “They are making all this noise about the ‘Internet of Everything’. That’s a nice ambitious vision, but how can Cisco capitalize on that, and win in that marketplace?,” asked O’Donnell. Robbins, 49, gave no clear indication of his strategy during a conference call with reporters on Monday, saying he would rather listen to customers and shareholders for the next 90 days before laying out his plan. The CEO-in-waiting, who takes over in late July, made his name at Cisco building relationships with the legion of companies that actually sell Cisco’s products to large businesses, making up about 80 percent of Cisco’s $49 billion in expected revenue this fiscal year. That makes Robbins, who holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics with a concentration in computer science from the University of North Carolina, a consummate salesman, like his predecessor. Chambers and Robbins, who joked together on a conference call earlier on Monday, are “cut of the same cloth”, said Tim Zimmerman, an analyst at Gartner. “He’s very sales focused, similar to John, and understands the voice of the customer,” he added. Cisco needs a leader to take the big picture and dismantle the “silo” approach to selling many, sometimes competing, products to clients, said Zimmerman. “Is he the right person? Time will always tell.” Some Wall Street analysts voiced reservations that Robbins had the deep knowledge of technology necessary to succeed. “While we like Chuck Robbins individually, we believe investors would benefit more from technology leadership at the company given the disruptive changes we believe are coming to networking,” said Rod Hall, an analyst at JP Morgan.

Cisco, the world’s biggest maker of switching equipment and routers that run the Internet, announced the investment plans following high-level meetings between top executives and Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang and other government agency leaders. A statement issued by the Silicon Valley company provided the broad outlines of how it planned to invest but did not detail any specific spending or timelines for doing so. It said in a statement it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with China’s state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission, to expand investment. This will be used to fund innovation, equity investment, research and development and job creation, Cisco said. It also signed an MoU with the Association of Universities (Colleges) of Applied Science (AUAS) to advance technical training of information and communications engineers.  The company said it will invest in a four-year network engineer training program with 100 universities and colleges of applied science recommended by AUAS. Cisco is looking to capitalize on initiatives promoted by the Chinese government including “China Manufacturing 2025”,  “Internet+” and its strategy to deliver more services as cloud-based Internet services. The move comes as pressure has grown on foreign technology firms in the world’s biggest Internet market as Beijing has moved to promote domestic technology suppliers it says are needed to protect state secrets and data.

534,CSCO,GM to test Cisco technology for sharing road safety spectrum,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co plans to begin testing new Cisco Systems Inc technology that could allow “talking” cars to share radio communication bands with roadside Wi-Fi devices, a GM executive told U.S. lawmakers. The technology could hold out the promise of allowing Wi-Fi devices to share the same radio band as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) safety systems without causing interference, he said in written testimony posted to a House oversight committee website on Wednesday. The automaker intends to deploy V2V technology in its 2017 Cadillac CTS sedans. “We are very optimistic about a sharing proposal from Cisco that would operate on a ‘listen, detect and vacate’ basis,” said Harry Lightsey, executive director of GM’s Global Connected Customer Experience unit. “We have engaged with Cisco and plan to begin testing their technology as soon as possible.” GM submitted the testimony to the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade ahead of a Thursday hearing on V2V technology. V2V technology would allow cars to talk to each other and avoid collisions, using the 5.9 GHz radio spectrum to share information about their relative positions, speeds, headings and braking status and warning drivers of possible risks. Safety regulators believe the technology could provide warnings in 80 percent of car accidents involving more than one vehicle.    But e-commerce companies have pressed for a share of the same spectrum for roadside Wi-Fi services, a prospect that some in the auto industry say could interfere with V2V systems and prevent them from operating properly.   Barry Einsig, Cisco’s global transportation executive, who is also scheduled to testify before the panel, said in his written testimony that the company’s “The Internet of Everything” envisions a communications network connecting cars and other vehicles with each other and roadside entities including police and other emergency responders. “Once vehicle-to-vehicle communications are widely installed in cars and light trucks as a safety measure, the private sector and our public sector partners, will respond swiftly to bring the full set of ... benefits to American consumers,” he said in the testimony. U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in May that auto regulators would propose a rule by year-end requiring V2V-technology in vehicles. He also said his department would complete a preliminary test plan to determine whether the V2V spectrum can be shared with other entities.

The technology could hold out the promise of allowing Wi-Fi devices to share the same radio band as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) safety systems without causing interference, he said in written testimony posted to a House oversight committee website on Wednesday. The automaker intends to deploy V2V technology in its 2017 Cadillac CTS sedans. “We are very optimistic about a sharing proposal from Cisco that would operate on a ‘listen, detect and vacate’ basis,” said Harry Lightsey, executive director of GM’s Global Connected Customer Experience unit. “We have engaged with Cisco and plan to begin testing their technology as soon as possible.” GM submitted the testimony to the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade ahead of a Thursday hearing on V2V technology. V2V technology would allow cars to talk to each other and avoid collisions, using the 5.9 GHz radio spectrum to share information about their relative positions, speeds, headings and braking status and warning drivers of possible risks. Safety regulators believe the technology could provide warnings in 80 percent of car accidents involving more than one vehicle. But e-commerce companies have pressed for a share of the same spectrum for roadside Wi-Fi services, a prospect that some in the auto industry say could interfere with V2V systems and prevent them from operating properly. Barry Einsig, Cisco’s global transportation executive, who is also scheduled to testify before the panel, said in his written testimony that the company’s “The Internet of Everything” envisions a communications network connecting cars and other vehicles with each other and roadside entities including police and other emergency responders. “Once vehicle-to-vehicle communications are widely installed in cars and light trucks as a safety measure, the private sector and our public sector partners, will respond swiftly to bring the full set of ... benefits to American consumers,” he said in the testimony. U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in May that auto regulators would propose a rule by year-end requiring V2V-technology in vehicles. He also said his department would complete a preliminary test plan to determine whether the V2V spectrum can be shared with other entities.

536,CSCO,Cisco to buy OpenDNS for $635 million to boost security business,"(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) said on Tuesday it would buy OpenDNS, a privately held cloud-based security firm, for $635 million, the latest move to boost its security business as cyber attacks increase in number and sophistication. Cisco has been buying a number of security companies, which has made its relatively tiny security business one of its fastest growing areas in the past two years.

The acquisition of OpenDNS is Cisco’s first after it said in May that veteran sales executive Chuck Robbins would replace John Chambers as CEO in July. “M&A; will continue to be an important part of what we do,” said Hilton Romanski, Cisco’s chief technology & strategy officer, adding that the M&A; strategy of being an active investor and potential acquirer will continue under Robbins.  The company, whose security business is known for its firewalls, expanded into intrusion detection and prevention systems with the $2.7 billion acquisition of Sourcefire in 2013. “We’re going to continue to focus on deals that allow us to complement what we’ve done with Sourcefire in the area of intrusion prevention and we’ll continue to look at malware and other key verticals inside the security domain,” Romanski said in an interview.

543,CSCO,BlackBerry names Cisco veteran as new global head of sales,"TORONTO (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd named Carl Wiese as head of global sales on Monday, an appointment that comes at a critical juncture for the smartphone industry pioneer, which needs to spur top-line growth in order for its turnaround efforts to succeed. Wiese has spent the past 12 years at Cisco Systems, first heading advanced technology sales and later its collaboration-product sales efforts. Those teams focus on aspects such as security and web conferencing, areas that BlackBerry is trying to expand within.   At BlackBerry, Wiese replaces John Sims, who had been with the company for 18 months. BlackBerry said Wiese, who has previously worked with Apple Inc, Avaya, Lucent and Texas Instruments, will be responsible for driving its go-to-market strategy and global sales efforts. “Carl has extensive experience in enterprise software and emerging technology solutions, which will be instrumental as BlackBerry moves toward stabilizing revenue,” BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen said in a statement.  The move comes less than three weeks after BlackBerry posted weaker-than-expected sales growth from its software business in the first quarter. Chen, who set a software revenue target of $500 million for the current fiscal year, has built his turnaround plan around a software growth strategy, hoping sales from device-management software and fledgling areas like the Internet of Things can replace BlackBerry’s traditional service fee structure and falling revenue from smartphone sales. Chen indicated last month that he remains comfortable with the $500 million revenue target, and noted that some of that growth is set to come from acquisitions.   Although quarterly software revenue more than doubled year-over-year, much of the growth came from two patent cross-licensing deals. This spooked many investors, who disappointed by the weaker-than-expected core software growth, sent shares in BlackBerry tumbling to a 13-month low on the Nasdaq last week. Ontario-based BlackBerry also backed away from a separate $100 million target for revenue from its BlackBerry Messenger service. Some analysts have long been skeptical about the viability of BlackBerry’s software revenue targets.  When Chen went over the company’s sales targets at an analysts’ event in San Francisco last November and received pushback from some analysts, he laughed and said if targets are not met, he would still be around next year, but some of his team might not. BlackBerry declined to comment on whether Sims’ departure was tied to weaker-than-expected software revenue growth.  BlackBerry is also widely expected to debut a new Android-based smartphone this year in an attempt to boost its hardware sales.

548,CSCO,France's Technicolor to buy Cisco's set-top box business,"PARIS (Reuters) - French media and entertainment technology group Technicolor (TCH.PA) will buy Cisco System’s (CSCO.O) home video equipment business for 550 million euros ($602 million), it said on Thursday, sending its shares to a five-year high. The cash-and-stock deal is part of Technicolor’s efforts to expand in the thriving home video market and boost profitability.  It will create the world No. 2 in customer premises equipment (CPE) - phone gear, cable and satellite TV set-top boxes, routers and switches - with total sales of 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) and a 15 percent market share. That compares with 25 percent that will be held by U.S. network gear maker Arris Group (ARRS.O) and British set-box maker Pace PIC.L when they complete a merger. “Video is what is driving traffic today,” Technicolor CEO Frederic Rose told a conference call. “All this is fueling a massive demand for customer premises television equipment.” By 0614 EDT Technicolor shares were up 19 percent, trading near 7.5 euros, their highest level in five years. “This deal makes sense as Technicolor needed to increase its size especially after the ongoing Pace/Arris deal,” said one Paris-based trader. He said Technicolor was buying Cisco’s business for four times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Rose acknowledged that talks between Technicolor and Cisco accelerated after the Arris-Pace deal was announced in April. The transaction will also boost Technicolor’s footprint in North America, the biggest CPE market in the world. The combined company will make 57 percent of its sales in North America. It will double annual revenue at its Connected Home division, give it 290 million set-top boxes installed in over 100 countries, and generate annual savings of over 100 million euros from 2018, the company said. Rose said he did not expect any large-scale restructuring as the two companies had complementary products. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 or in the first quarter of 2016. After completion, Technicolor said its Connected Home division should reach adjusted EBITDA in excess of 200 million euros by the end of 2016, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8-9 percent by 2017. The deal will also boost earnings per share by a double-digit percentage at a group level as of 2016, Technicolor said.  Under the terms of the deal, Cisco will receive about 413 million euros in cash and about 137 million euros in newly issued Technicolor shares, subject to certain adjustments provided for in the agreement. The 413 million euro cash portion will be financed through cash on hand and fully underwritten new debt.

It will create the world No. 2 in customer premises equipment (CPE) - phone gear, cable and satellite TV set-top boxes, routers and switches - with total sales of 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) and a 15 percent market share. That compares with 25 percent that will be held by U.S. network gear maker Arris Group and British set-box maker Pace when they complete a merger. “Video is what is driving traffic today,” Technicolor CEO Frederic Rose told a conference call. “All this is fueling a massive demand for customer premises television equipment.” By 1014 GMT Technicolor shares were up 19 percent, trading near 7.5 euros, their highest level in five years. “This deal makes sense as Technicolor needed to increase its size especially after the ongoing Pace/Arris deal,” said one Paris-based trader. He said Technicolor was buying Cisco’s business for four times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA). Rose acknowledged that talks between Technicolor and Cisco accelerated after the Arris-Pace deal was announced in April. The transaction will also boost Technicolor’s footprint in North America, the biggest CPE market in the world. The combined company will make 57 percent of its sales in North America. It will double annual revenue at its Connected Home division, give it 290 million set-top boxes installed in over 100 countries, and generate annual savings of over 100 million euros from 2018, the company said. Rose said he did not expect any large-scale restructuring as the two companies had complementary products. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 or in the first quarter of 2016. After completion, Technicolor said its Connected Home division should reach adjusted EBITDA in excess of 200 million euros by the end of 2016, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8-9 percent by 2017. The deal will also boost earnings per share by a double-digit percentage at a group level as of 2016, Technicolor said. Under the terms of the deal, Cisco will receive about 413 million euros in cash and about 137 million euros in newly issued Technicolor shares, subject to certain adjustments provided for in the agreement. The 413 million euro cash portion will be financed through cash on hand and fully underwritten new debt.

The deal will also translate into double-digit earnings per share accretion at group level starting in the first full year after closing, it said.

554,CSCO,Internet firms to be subject to new cybersecurity rules in EU,"(Reuters) - Internet firms such as Cisco, Google  and Amazon will be subject to a new EU cybersecurity law forcing them to adopt tough security measures and possibly report serious breaches to national authorities, according to a document seen by Reuters. The so-called Network and Information Security Directive has been stuck in talks between member states and EU lawmakers  because of disagreements over whether to include digital platforms such as search engines, social networks, e-commerce sites and cloud computing providers. Members of the European Parliament want the law to only cover sectors they consider critical, such as energy, transport and finance. But after months of negotiations, digital platforms will now fall under the law’s remit, albeit with less onerous security obligations, according to the document, which did not provide details of the obligations. The paper from Luxembourg, which holds the rotating European Union presidency, suggests adopting a lighter approach for digital service platforms which typically do not have direct links to physical infrastructure such as, for example, a nuclear power company. Any firm meeting the law’s definition of a digital service platform — which is still under discussion — would automatically be covered to avoid member states taking different approaches and causing fragmentation across the 28-nation EU. A cloud computing provider or any other digital firm providing a service for an infrastructure operator would be subject to the same rules applying to that operator, according to the document, which could still change in discussions after the summer. Internet firms will also be subject to notification requirements in cases of security breaches, although there is no agreement yet on whether these should be mandatory or voluntary. The paper asks member states to express their preferences at a meeting in September, after which drafting of a full legal text will start. Firms in the digital sphere oppose being included in the law’s scope. “We’re pleased to see digital service platforms subject to a different regime but we’re disappointed at the lack of recognition that it is the use of cloud that determines the security risk not the service itself,” said Chris Gow, Senior Manager, Government Affairs at Cisco. The European Commission — the EU executive — and some member states reckon that because of the widespread use of Internet services and the number of businesses that rely on the web they should also be subject to security rules and reporting requirements.

557,CSCO,Strong U.S. sales help Cisco beat estimates,"(Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit as strong demand for its products in the United States more than offset weakness elsewhere. Shares of Cisco, considered a bellwether for the performance of the broader network gear industry, rose nearly 4 percent in extended trading on Wednesday. The company is the market leader in selling network equipment to businesses, controlling about half of the $38 billion global market and overshadowing rivals Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd HWT.UL, according to market research firm Gartner. Cisco’s latest results also underscore an ongoing recovery in sales of the company’s switches and routers, which were hit by a slowdown in spending by telecom carriers, its traditional customers, in the second half of 2014. Needham & Co analyst Alex Henderson said the 7 percent rise in revenue in the Americas was a “laudable performance.” The region accounted for 61 percent of total sales in the fourth quarter. “I think for the entire market - and Cisco is a microcosm of it - the international markets are the key issue.” Cisco said revenue from other geographies declined marginally. The company has also been investing in new products and services such as data analytics software, security and cloud-management tools. Cisco said in June it would buy cloud-based security firm OpenDNS for $635 million. The company also said revenue from telecom providers rose 2 percent in the quarter but added that it did not expect an increase in capital spending by its traditional customers. “Cisco’s best years are ahead of us,” Chuck Robbins said on the post-earnings conference call, his first as Cisco’s chief executive. Robbins took over from veteran John Chambers in July. The company forecast revenue growth of 2-4 percent for the first quarter, which translates to $12.49 billion-$12.73 billion. It forecast adjusted earnings per share of 55 cents-57 cents. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $12.55 billion on a profit of 56 cents per share. For the fourth quarter, the company earned 59 cents per share on an adjusted basis, while revenue rose nearly 4 percent to $12.84 billion. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 56 cents per share on revenue of $12.65 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Up to Wednesday’s close of $27.90, shares had fallen nearly 5 percent since the company last reported results in May.

559,CSCO,US STOCKS-Wall St ends near flat after late-day rally,"* Energy shares rally after sharp selloff; Apple also rebounds * Financials weigh as China news clouds U.S. rate hike timing * Alibaba falls to record low as revenue growth slows * Indexes: Dow flat, S&P; up 0.1 pct, Nasdaq up 0.2 pct   (New throughout, updates prices and market activity to add Cisco up after the bell) By Caroline Valetkevitch Aug 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rebounded in afternoon trading on Wednesday to end little changed as energy shares and Apple bounced back, offseting continued concerns about a slowdown in China. The S&P; energy index climbed 1.9 percent, the S&P; 500’s biggest positive, as investors grabbed energy companies shares, encouraged by a bounce up in oil prices from six-year lows hit the previous session. Energy companies have reeled in recent weeks on concerns about China, a top consumer of energy and commodities. Apple, for which China is a key market, also reversed course after falling more than 3 percent earlier to its lowest since January. It ended up 1.5 percent at $115.24 and was the biggest positive factor for all three major indexes. Stocks had tumbled early in the session after China’s currency hit a four-year low, its second session of decline. The Dow moved nearly 300 points from its low of the day to its high before closing flat. The S&P; 500 briefly dipped into negative territory for the year during the session, and traded below its 200-day moving average, before bouncing back. The S&P; 500 ended above that technical support level and up for the year so far. “China is a huge wild card both in terms of the rate at which it’s slowing but also how the leadership is handling it,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T; Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. “The reversal today is bullish ... at least in the short term.” Among sectors, financial shares declined the most, with the S&P; financial index down 0.8 percent. China’s currency move has created more uncertainty over how soon the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, analysts said. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.33 points to 17,402.51, the S&P; 500 gained 1.98 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,086.05 and the Nasdaq Composite added 7.60 points, or 0.15 percent, to 5,044.39. The CBOE Volatility index, a measure of the premium traders are willing to pay for protection against a drop in the S&P; 500, also reversed course. It jumped as much as 18.7 percent to 16.28, its highest in a month, before ending down 0.7 percent. Alibaba was down 5.1 percent at $73.38 after hitting an all-time low of $71.03 after revenue growth slowed at China’s biggest e-commerce company. Yahoo , which has a 15 percent stake in Alibaba, fell 4.3 percent to $34.49. Macy’s fell 5.1 percent to $64.11 after it also reported weak quarterly sales. After the bell, shares of Cisco Systems rose 3.7 percent. Results of the network equipment maker beat estimates as demand recovered for its switching equipment and routers. During the session, NYSE decliners outnumbered advancers by 1.02-to-1; on the Nasdaq, 1,564 issues fell and 1,229 advanced. The S&P; 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and 19 lows; the Nasdaq recorded 30 new highs and 120 lows.

Cisco rallied 3.9 percent to $28.99, set for its best day since February, and gave the biggest boost to the Nasdaq and the S&P; 500. U.S. retail sales rose in July, while the trend of weekly jobless claims pointed to a tightening job market. The S&P; consumer discretionary index rose 1.2 percent, the most among the major 10 S&P; sectors, though the data supported the view the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates as early as September. Limiting gains was a decline in energy shares as U.S. crude oil prices slid to a six-and-a-half year low. The S&P; energy index was down 1.3 percent. Stocks had rebounded to end near flat on Wednesday after two days of worries over a devaluation of the yuan and a slowdown in China pressured stocks earlier in the week. Though China said its economic fundamentals provided “strong support” for the yuan, sources told Reuters that some within the government were pushing for the yuan to go even lower. “Yesterday I think they turned it on a little bit of bargain hunting in beaten-down sectors like energy and industrials, and today it seems like they ... have shrugged off the Chinese devaluation.

The S&P; financial index rose 0.6 percent, after falling in the previous two session on speculation that the Fed would wait until December to raise rates after China devalued the yuan on Tuesday.

Lead investors in the fund are Bank of Montreal,  Cisco Systems and the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS), parent of OMERS Ventures. The funding comes almost four years after OMERS Ventures raised C$210 million in its first round. Investments in the Canadian technology industry have been gathering momentum in recent months, driven by a steady stream of funding and capital-raising. Canadian venture capital investments soared to C$1.19 billion in the first half of 2015, a 33 percent increase from the first half of last year and the strongest first half since 2002, according to data from Thomson Reuters. “This second fund validates the opportunities that OMERS and our partners, Cisco and BMO, see in the Canadian innovation landscape,” OMERS Ventures Chief Executive John Ruffolo said. The initial public offering of Canadian e-commerce company Shopify Inc in May was one of the highlights in the Canadian market this year. OMERS Ventures invested in Shopify before its IPO and was one of the big winners from the offering. Shopify’s shares were priced at $17 in the United States in May and have doubled in value since then. “We are very bullish on the Canadian technology sector,” said David Wismer, managing director at BMO Capital Markets. “(The) second fund is an important example of more capital being made available to help grow Canadian technology companies.” BMO led Kinaxis in an initial public offering last year and has also advised Hootsuite and Real Matters in their funding rounds.

577,CSCO,UPDATE 2-Cisco router break-ins bypass cyber defences,"(Adds comments by FireEye CEO, possible involvement of a national agency; refiled to modify this advisory) By Eric Auchard FRANKFURT, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Security researchers say they have uncovered clandestine attacks across three continents on the routers that direct traffic around the Internet, potentially allowing suspected cyberspies to harvest vast amounts of data while going undetected. In the attacks, a highly sophisticated form of malicious software, dubbed SYNful Knock, has been implanted in routers made by Cisco, the world’s top supplier, U.S. security research firm FireEye said on Tuesday. Routers are attractive to hackers because they operate outside the perimeter of firewalls, anti-virus, behavioural detection software and other security tools that organisations  use to safeguard data traffic. Until now, they were considered vulnerable to sustained denial-of-service attacks using barrages of millions of packets of data, but not outright takeover. “If you own (seize control of) the router, you own the data of all the companies and government organisations that sit behind that router,” FireEye Chief Executive Dave DeWalt told Reuters of his company’s discovery. “This is the ultimate spying tool, the ultimate corporate espionage tool, the ultimate cybercrime tool,” DeWalt said. The attacks have hit multiple industries and government agencies, he said. Cisco confirmed it had alerted customers to the attacks in August and said they were not due to any vulnerability in its own software. Instead, the attackers stole valid network administration credentials from targeted organisations or managed to gain for themselves physical access to the routers. “We’ve shared guidance on how customers can harden their network, and prevent, detect and remediate this type of attack,” Cisco said in a statement. Altogether FireEye's computer forensic arm Mandiant has so far found 14 instances of the router implants in India, Mexico, Philippines and Ukraine, the company said in a blog post at bit.ly/1ObMm7u.  It added that this may be just the tip of the iceberg in terms of yet-to-be-discovered attacks. Because the attacks actually replace the basic software controlling the routers, infections persist when devices are shut off and restarted.

584,CSCO,Cisco security researchers disable big distributor of 'ransomware',"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc said it had managed to disrupt the spread of one of the most pernicious systems for infecting Internet users with malicious software such as so-called ransomware, which demands payment for decrypting users’ data. The investigators from Cisco’s Talos security unit were looking at the Angler Exploit Kit, which analysts at several companies say has been the most effective of several kits at capturing control of personal computers in the past year, infecting up to 40 percent of those it targeted. They found that about half of computers infected with Angler were connecting to servers at a hosting provider in Dallas, which had been hired by criminals with stolen credit cards. The provider, Limestone Networks, pulled the plug on the servers and turned over data that helped show how Angler worked. The research effort, aided by carrier Level 3 Communications, allowed Cisco to copy the authentication protocols the Angler criminals use to interact with their prey. Knowing these protocols will allow security companies to cut off infected computers. “It’s going to be really damaging to the attacker’s network,” Talos manager Craig Williams told Reuters ahead of the release of the report. Cisco said that since Limestone pulled the plug on the servers, new Angler infections had fallen off dramatically. Limestone’s client relations manager told Reuters his company had unwittingly helped the spread of Angler before the Cisco investigation. Often sold in clandestine Internet forums or in one-to-one deals, exploit kits combine many small programs that take advantage of flaws in Web browsers and other common pieces of software. Buyers of those kits must also arrange a way to reach their targets, typically by sending spoof emails, hacking into websites or distributing malicious advertisements. Once they win control of a target’s computer, exploit kit buyers can install whatever they want, including so-called ransomware. This includes a number of branded programs, also sold online, that encrypt users’ computer files and demand payment to release them. Talos estimated that if three percent of infected users paid the ransom averaging $300, the criminals that had used the Limestone servers to spread Angler could have made about $30 million a year.

590,CSCO,Cyber security stocks get filip from Talk hack attack,"* Cybersecurity “ISPY” ETF up 3 pct since launch * Issue in spotlight after attack on TalkTalk * Certain stocks have outperformed after TalkTalk hack By Sudip Kar-Gupta LONDON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The hacking scandal at broadband provider TalkTalk has heightened interest in stocks and companies dealing in cyber security, with some fund managers betting on more growth in the sector. British police said on Friday that they had arrested a second teenager in connection with the breach at TalkTalk, which may have led to the theft of personal data from among the company’s more than 4 million customers. TalkTalk was not the first such incident, but traders and investors said it should re-ignite interest in companies offering protection against hack attacks. Market research firm Gartner has estimated that global spending on IT security is set to increase 8.2 percent in 2015 to $77 billion. Corporations around the world will spend $101 billion on information security in 2018, Gartner says. That has caught the attention of financial markets. The ISPY  exchange-traded-fund, which lets investors hold a basket of cyber security stocks - such as Cisco Systems  and Sophos Group - has risen around 3 percent . “As cyber crime continues to grow, governments and companies are prioritising cyber security as an essential investment. This is a sector we can expect to dominate headlines and corporate budgets,” said Kris Monaco, the head of ISE ETF Ventures. Others focussed on some relatively small British stocks whose shares have risen, in contrast to those of TalkTalk whose stock has fallen 6 percent in the last week. Falanx Group has climbed 15 percent over that same period. NCC Group and Corero Network Security  - an offshoot of the former Corero software business - have risen 3 percent. Corero’s products include software that protects against attacks on Internet sites and domain addresses. NCC has similar services, including one to test how vulnerable a company is to “phishing” - where internal emails are hacked by someone posing as an employee or outside contact - while Falanx has services monitoring clients’ computer infrastructure for signs of suspicious activity. John Blamire, a former British Army officer who is chief executive at Falanx, said customer interest had risen since the attack on TalkTalk. “Incidents such as the one at TalkTalk actively brings attention to organisations such as ours,” he said. To be sure, stocks such as these would carry the usual risks associated with “small cap” stocks with a relatively small market valuation - less liquidity, which can then make them more prone to a slump and harder to sell than bigger stocks. Nevertheless, they have attracted some big-name investment houses, with Liontrust Asset Management holding a near 10 percent stake in NCC while Blackrock Investment Management has a near 3 percent holding in Corero. Both Liontrust and Blackrock declined to comment on those holdings. Mark Slater, chief investment officer at Slater Investments, holds around 3 million NCC shares in his company’s portfolio, and he expected NCC and others to continue to grow. “The nature of the Internet makes it open to attack. These problems are not going to go away.”   (Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Lionel Laurent, Larry King)",10302015,http://www.reuters.com/article/talktalk-cyberattack-stocks/cyber-security-stocks-get-filip-from-talk-hack-attack-idUSL8N12U2NU20151030

Ericsson, whose like-for-like sales are down 7 percent so far this year and were roughly flat over the previous three years, said the partnership means new areas of revenue as it will boost its addressable market, mainly in professional services, software and the resale of Cisco products. “We are the wireless No. 1 in the world,” Ericsson Chief Executive Hans Vestberg told Reuters. “Cisco is by far the No. 1 in the world when it comes to IP routers. Together we can create innovative solutions.” The companies said in a statement they would together offer routing, data center, networking, cloud, mobility, management and control, and global services capabilities. “The strategic partnership will be a key driver of growth and value for the next decade, with each company benefiting from incremental revenue in calendar year 2016 and expected to ramp (up) to $1 billion or more for each by 2018,” they said. Ericsson expects full-year cost synergies of 1 billion Swedish crowns ($115 million) in 2018 due to the partnership and said it would continue to explore further joint business opportunities with Cisco.

Ericsson, whose like-for-like sales are down 7 percent so far this year and were roughly flat over the previous three years, said the partnership means new areas of revenue as it will boost its addressable market, mainly in professional services, software and the resale of Cisco products. “We are the wireless No. 1 in the world,” Ericsson Chief Executive Hans Vestberg told Reuters. “Cisco is by far the No. 1 in the world when it comes to IP routers. Together we can create innovative solutions.” The companies said in a statement they would together offer routing, data centre, networking, cloud, mobility, management and control, and global services capabilities. “The strategic partnership will be a key driver of growth and value for the next decade, with each company benefiting from incremental revenue in calendar year 2016 and expected to ramp (up) to $1 billion or more for each by 2018,” they said. Ericsson expects full-year cost synergies of 1 billion Swedish crowns ($115 million) in 2018 due to the partnership and said it would continue to explore further joint business opportunities with Cisco.

596,CSCO,"Ericsson cuts market growth view, looks beyond networks","STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Ericsson (ERICb.ST), the world’s biggest mobile network equipment maker, pared back its market growth forecast on Tuesday, but said it could expand beyond its mainstay networks business, aided by a new deal with data network supplier Cisco. The Swedish company said it expected growth in the overall markets in which it competes to average 2-4 percent per year between 2014 and 2018, down from its previous estimate, issued a year ago, for 3-5 percent growth in 2013-2017. Ericsson has been struggling this year as sales have fallen 7 percent on a like-for-like basis and were roughly flat over the previous three years, raising questions over its growth prospects in its highly competitive markets. “The strategy is clear, we want to be improving the core areas – profitability, and of course having growth there as well,” Chief Executive Hans Vestberg told investors at Ericsson’s annual capital markets day meeting. “We are not yet where we are satisfied,” he said. For its mainstay networks unit, which accounts for roughly half of sales, Ericsson said it saw on average 1-3 percent annual market growth, and 3-5 percent for telecom services, while support solutions offered to network operators, still a tiny part of its business, were seen growing 7-9 percent. Ericsson said sales in the areas targeted for growth were 45 billion Swedish crowns ($5.2 billion) in the year through Sept. 30, up from 35 billion in the year-ago period, and repeated it sees market growth of 10 percent a year in those areas. It was the first time Ericsson has disclosed sales figures for new growth areas where it has been investing heavily, responding to calls from investors to be more transparent.

Executives at both Cisco and Ericsson said in an on-stage interview that they expected “at least” $1 billion a-piece during the first phase of the partnership announced this week, but that they had bigger ambitions for the years to come. Mounting a spirited defense of the deal with investors at the Morgan Stanley TMT conference, Cisco Executive Chairman John Chambers and Ericsson CEO Hans Vestberg said the projected revenue boost only covers their partnership’s first two years. “We have much higher ambitions,” Vestberg said, referring to revenue targets. “If we do this right, there are other opportunities as well,” Ericsson’s CEO said of further sales growth ahead. The deal calls for each company to resell the other’s products, expand the range of services they provide while working to merge mobile and fixed-line networks, they said. The first stage of the partnership will focus largely on providing equipment and services for telecom network operators aiming to upgrade their existing networks to the cloud, they said. A second stage will involve selling to corporate enterprises, and a third stage will cover the wider world of network-connected devices in cars, industry, retail and agriculture. Responding to a fund manager who questioned how big any partnership might be to either company, Chambers said $1 billion in fresh sales would expand Cisco revenues by just 2 percent and add 3 percent to Ericsson’s top line, but these targets have little incremental expense, boosting the profit ratios of both.  “If you are asking if we do Phase 1 right, is there incremental upside? The answer is yes,” Chambers said, adding that the two were being cautious in their predictions.

601,CSCO,Cisco second-quarter forecast misses on order slowdown,"(Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc’s (CSCO.O) forecast adjusted profit and revenue growth for the second quarter below analysts’ estimates, citing a slowdown in order growth and weakness in its enterprise business outside the United States. Shares of Cisco, considered a bellwether for the performance of the broader network gear industry, fell 5 percent to $26.41 in extended trading on Thursday. A strong dollar hurt demand for Cisco’s enterprise products in Asia-Pacific, Canada and Latin America, said Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins, who succeeded long-time CEO John Chambers in July. “Our guidance reflects lower-than-expected order growth in the first quarter, driven largely by the uncertainty of the macro environment and currency impacts,” Robbins added. Cisco said it expected adjusted profit of 53-55 cents and revenue to be flat to up 2 percent, which translates into $11.94 billion-$12.17 billion. Analysts were expecting a profit of 56 cents on revenue of $12.55 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Needham & Co analyst Alex Henderson attributed Cisco’s disappointing forecast to its exposure to emerging markets. “It has a much higher percentage exposure to those emerging markets than most companies,” Henderson said. Cisco is beefing up its enterprise and wireless security businesses to counter lower spending by telecom carriers, its traditional customers, and nimbler rivals who are quickly grabbing market share through their software-focused networking products. In August, Cisco teamed up with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to improve the performance of iPads and iPhones on its network. More recently, the company partnered with Ericsson (ERICb.ST) to make next generation networks that should generate additional revenues of $1 billion for each company by 2018. For the first quarter, the company reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit. Revenue rose 3.6 percent to $12.68 billion, while analysts were expecting $12.65 billion. Net income rose 33 percent to $2.43 billion, or 48 cents per share, in the first quarter ended Oct. 24.

The three indexes are on track to close the week down more than 3 percent, snapping a run of ending higher for six weeks in a row. Dow component Cisco fell 6.4 percent to $26.05 after it gave a weak forecast, citing a slowdown in orders and weak spending outside the United States. The stock was the second-biggest drag on the S&P; and the Nasdaq and pulled down the stock of tech heavyweights such as Oracle and Microsoft. Retailers were hit by disappointing reports from department store chains. Nordstrom lowered its full-year forecast on Thursday, spooking investors who were already jittery after Macy’s cut its forecast on Wednesday. Added to that, data showed U.S. retail sales rose less than expected in October, suggesting a slowdown in consumer spending. “It seems like, from a technicals perspective, it’s time for a little bit of a breather, and ... we’re seeing some data points that support that,” said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners in Washington DC. The weak retail data on Friday likely disappointed investors who were expecting retail consumption to offset the weakness in industrials and energy stocks, Bailey said. Consumer stocks have been a bright spot this year as weak commodity prices, fears of a global slowdown and the anticipation of a U.S. rate hike have hit most stocks, especially those of materials, energy and industrial companies.

Privately held Acano’s products includes gateways as well as video and audio bridging technology that allows customers to connect video systems from vendors across multiple platforms. Cisco has been beefing up its enterprise and wireless security businesses to counter lower spending by telecom carriers, its traditional customers, and stiff competition from nimbler rivals. The company said on Friday said Acano’s employees will receive additional retention-based incentives. London-based Acano team will join Cisco’s collaboration technology business, which grew 17 percent in the first quarter of 2016. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter, Cisco said. Cisco’s shares were up 0.29 percent in premarket trading on Friday.

Cisco and its lawyers from Kirkland & Ellis were correct in arguing that the lower court judge wrongly calculated the damages figure by not excluding the value the patent accrued by being declared a standard essential patent, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit unanimously ruled on Thursday.

613,CSCO,Cisco chairman promises 'win-win' deal with China over network control,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Cisco’s (CSCO.O) executive chairman on Monday declined to say whether it would cede to China’s demands to be able to control equipment deployed in the world’s largest internet market, instead pledging to find a “win-win” solution.  The world’s top maker of switching equipment and routers that run the Internet has a bet big on China, announcing in June it would invest more than $10 billion in the country along with local business partners. Cisco’s commitment comes despite unease among foreign business groups over a China national security law adopted in July demanding all key network infrastructure and information systems be “secure and controllable”. “We will find a way to make it a win-win situation,” executive chairman John Chambers told Reuters on the sidelines of a news conference in Dubai.  Foreign firms warn China’s new law is vaguely worded and could require technology firms to manufacture products in China or release source code to inspectors, thereby exposing intellectual property. “We give our source code to no one,” Chambers told the conference when asked if Cisco would give China a written promise that it would comply with government demands, declining to directly answer the question.  “We spent three years winning the trust of the Chinese government and if you watch most American companies, their businesses in China is down dramatically, so was ours for several years. Do you know how much we grew in China last quarter? Forty percent.” Foreign technology firms have been increasingly squeezed out of China, the world’s biggest Internet market, as Beijing seeks to promote domestic technology suppliers it says are needed to protect state secrets and data. Earlier this year, a Reuters analysis found Cisco was among U.S. technology firms that had been dropped from state procurement lists in recent years. “There are legitimate needs of all government in terms of the issues of terrorism and national security,” added Chambers.  “I think you have to disclose when you’re gathering information on people and if you do it right on a trust basis, even with some of the countries of the world that might surprise you, you can find a true partnership basis.” ",12072015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cisco-systems-china-lawmaking/cisco-chairman-promises-win-win-deal-with-china-over-network-control-idUSKBN0TQ2CI20151207

620,CSCO,Cisco reviews code after Juniper breach; more scrutiny expected,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Networking equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc said on Monday it has launched a product review to look for tampering after rival Juniper Networks Inc’s disclosure it found code in firewall software that made in vulnerable to cyber attacks.  Juniper warned customers on Thursday that it had uncovered “unauthorized code” in its firewall software, saying it could be exploited to allow an attacker to unscramble encrypted communications that travel through the security devices. That prompted the code review by Cisco. Security experts said they expect other technology companies to conduct similar investigations after last week’s unprecedented news from Juniper.  It was the first time a major technology firm discovered the addition of an unauthorized ‘back door,” or code that could be exploited to facilitate cyber attacks, according to security experts.  “I can’t imagine there is a major vendor that isn’t doing a major code audit now,” said HD Moore, chief research officer with Rapid7 Inc.  Technology companies regularly audit their code for bugs, including “back doors” that attackers could leverage to launch cyber attacks on customer networks.  But Moore said that such reviews focus on “back doors” that are unintentionally created, not ones inserted without the manufacturer’s knowledge.  “The challenge is that nobody has been looking for this in the past,” said Moore, an expert in software vulnerabilities. “If you know you are looking for a malicious backdoor, you have a much better chance of finding something.” Cryptologist Bruce Schneier said that technology companies should have long been looking for unauthorized code, but that many ignored the problem since the reviews boost expenses. “The fundamental problem is that the market doesn’t reward the things we want like secure code. Nobody wants to pay for it,” he said. Cisco said on its blog that the testing will include code reviews by engineers with deep networking and cryptography experience as well as penetration testing, a process where technicians attempt to attack products to find bugs the way malicious hackers might seek to exploit them.  Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it was investigating how the Juniper “back door” might impact government networks. “As we routinely do when such vulnerabilities are brought to light, we are assessing the potential impact, if any, on federal networks, and will take any appropriate mitigation measures in close coordination with interagency partners,” said agency spokesman S.Y. Lee.  ",12212015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-juniper-networks-cyberattack-cisco-sy/cisco-reviews-code-after-juniper-breach-more-scrutiny-expected-idUSKBN0U42FQ20151221

624,CSCO,Cisco wins U.S. patent dispute over wifi technology,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc did not infringe a patent holding company’s wifi technology, a U.S. appeals court ruled on Monday, reversing a near $64-million judgment against the networking equipment maker in the long-running patent dispute.  After eight years of litigation that also included a trip to the U.S. Supreme Court, the decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said Cisco was not liable for directly infringing or inducing others to infringe a patent held by Commil USA LLC on a way to help spread wireless signals over a large area, where multiple access points are needed. Cisco General Counsel Mark Chandler said the company was gratified by the ruling. “The patent never had anything to do with our products and the millions of dollars spent defending this unmeritorious suit are a travesty,” he said in an emailed statement.  Representatives for Commil could not be reached on Monday. Texas-based Commil USA sued Cisco in 2007, shortly after buying the patent from an Israeli company, Commil Ltd, according to court documents. Cisco has called it a non-practicing entity, referring to a company that primarily makes money by licensing patents instead of making products. In 2011, a federal jury in Texas found that Cisco induced infringement by encouraging its customers to use Cisco products that infringe Commil’s patent. The jury awarded Commil almost $63.8 million in damages. A judge subsequently added $10.3 million in interest. In 2013, the Washington, D.C.-based Federal Circuit, the nation’s top appeals court specializing in patent issues, ordered a new trial, saying that Cisco should have been able to mount a defense based on its “good faith belief” that Commil’s patent was invalid.  The Supreme Court in May said that defense was not legitimate, throwing out the ruling and sending the case back to the Federal Circuit.  A three-judge Federal Circuit panel on Monday again ruled in favor of San Jose, California-based Cisco.

Here the Swedish company faces tough competition from Finnish network equipment maker Nokia and Franco-American Alcatel-Lucent which are poised to drive higher sales growth and improve profit margins by merging early in 2016. Ericsson’s strategy has been to steer clear of larger acquisitions, instead partnering with data network giant Cisco Systems Inc to jointly sell products. Analysts worry that the combined Nokia-Alcatel Lucent will prove a more attractive supplier to telecom operators as it will be stronger in fixed-line data communications. Ericsson, whose fourth quarter capped a second year of falling like-for-like sales, declining by 5 percent in 2015 after a 2 percent drop in 2014, managed to cut operating expenses by 12 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, mostly in research and development. It said it was on track to save 9 billion crowns ($1.1 billion) annually by 2017 and flagged there could be more cuts.” Our preparedness is much higher if we need to do more,” Ericsson CEO Hans Vestberg told a conference call, without providing specific targets. “I think we will see some tough years ahead, and they should be happy with zero growth,” said Inge Heydorn, a fund manager at Sentat Asset Management who has no position in Ericsson. With no growth in sight for its core business and no firm targets for more savings, Ericsson shares had fallen 5.5 percent by 1127 GMT (6:27 a.m. ET) after a strong performance in the past few days. Ericsson said sales of network equipment in China had picked up, while networks sales in its biggest market North America were stable. Finance chief Jan Frykhammar said North America would not come back to 2014 levels, a year of big investments in new networks, at least not in the short term.  Operating profit was 11.0 billion crowns compared to 6.3 billion a year ago and above a mean forecast of 10.6 billion in a Reuters poll of analysts.     Sales and profits were lifted by a one-off payment from Apple Inc after the companies settled litigation last month and signed a patent license agreement.

Commil USA LLC said last month’s decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit clearing Cisco of infringement should have been made years ago when the case was first up at the court, “thereby mooting the Supreme Court appeal and avoiding the expenditure of vast time and resources of both parties and the Supreme Court.” It made the statement in a petition Wednesday by its attorney Leslie Payne of Heim Payne & Chorush asking the Federal Circuit to rehear the case en banc.

630,CSCO,Cisco to pay $1.4 bln for Internet of Things firm Jasper,"Feb 3 (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc said on Wednesday it was buying Jasper Technologies Inc, a startup that connects devices like cars and medical devices to the Internet, for $1.4 billion in cash and equity awards, its largest acquisition since 2013. Legacy technology companies like Cisco have been trying to find paths for growth while new technology developments, such as the rise of cloud computing, threaten their core businesses. The so called Internet of Things, the area Jasper specializes in, offers Cisco a chance to offer cutting-edge technology to its current customers such as telecommunications companies. Jasper connects devices like cars, jet engines and pacemakers to the Internet and also makes a software platform that helps monitor these devices once they are online. Rob Salvagno, Cisco’s vice president of corporate development, said in an interview that the Internet of Things has been a priority for the company for the past few years. “We’ve been keeping an eye on this market and what we noticed was that Jasper represented a unique asset. We believe they are the largest Internet of Things service platform of scale today,” he said. Cisco, which has acquired dozens of smaller companies over the years, is shifting its business towards high-end switches and routers and investing in new products such as data analytics software and cloud-based tools for data centers. This was the largest deal for Cisco since it acquired security company Sourcefire for $2.7 billion in 2013. Jasper had been planning an initial public offering and had banks to help it prepare. Its investors such as Singapore’s Temasek, Sequoia Capital and Benchmark Capital, will now get a chance to cash out without having to brave the rocky equity markets which have seen no technology IPOs this year. Jasper’s chief executive Jahangir Mohammed will stay on with Cisco and run a new Internet of Things Software Business Unit once the deal closes in the third quarter. In March 2015, another big legacy company, IBM, said it would invest $3 billion over the next four years to help companies track the data from sensor-equipped devices and smartphones. IBM calls its initiative the IoT Foundation. Other competitors in the space include GE and Microsoft.   (Reporting by Liana B.

636,CSCO,"Earnings bolster Cisco, but raise concerns for broader IT spending","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Networking giant Cisco Systems Inc reported it is weathering a global slowdown in information-technology spending, but signs potential customers are putting some projects on hold exacerbated concerns about broader IT growth. Cisco shares rose 10 percent on Thursday, bucking the overall market after it set a profit target in line with Wall Street expectations despite the weaker spending it noted around the world by businesses. The company also cut targets three months ago, moderating Wall Street expectations. Cisco Chief Executive Chuck Robbins on Wednesday told analysts that customers in January “paused a bit” as they evaluated the economy. Spending on key projects continued while more optional ones were put on hold. Analysts took that as a bad sign for some technology companies. “This was really a litmus test for all of IT spending,” said Sun Trust analyst Inder Singh about Cisco’s comments. “When they speak, and they talk about a slowdown, and a deceleration, usually it affects the broader market.” Cisco’s guidance was “prescient in terms of affecting other companies,” he added. Cisco reported weakness in data centers and switching. Some analysts saw potential trouble for other data-center products such as networking, servers, storage, and virtualization.  Shares in storage company EMC were down 1 percent on Thursday. Shares of IBM, which makes servers and sells other related services, were down 2 percent. HP Enterprises, which sells server products, fell 5 percent in a generally weak market.  Conversely, Cisco said demand for security and next-generation data centers, which rely more heavily on software than traditional data centers, withstood the downturn. Shares of Arista Networks, which makes next-generation data center switches, showed slight gains Thursday. The company reports earnings next week. One believer in next-generation data centers, insurance company Assured Guaranty, has upgraded its facilities by replacing separate components with all-in-one hardware and software from Westborough, Mass.-based SimpliVity. The new system includes components from Cisco.  “The busywork is gone,” said Jason Elizaitis, Assured’s director of IT operations, who said the system also cost 50 percent less to buy than replacing the previous one. Still, such business remains a relatively small part of the overall IT market.  Global IT spending is slated to rise 1.7 percent this year, but Gartner analyst Richard Gordon says the research firm may revisit that estimate.  “I would not be surprised to see our forecast for IT spending growth decline in our next update due to increased macroeconomic concerns, geopolitical worries and market volatility creating negative business sentiment,” he said, adding he wasn’t expecting a “dramatic slowdown” due to the essential nature of technology spending.  Many chief information officers are likely searching for ways to save money short term that will not get in the way of overall long-term planning, said Ralph Loura, formerly chief information officer at HP. But that tactic might change. “Once the pressures on cost persist for an extended time or are a significant enough inflection point,” he said, “then you revisit core strategy.” ",2112016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cisco-systems-results-impact-analysis/earnings-bolster-cisco-but-raise-concerns-for-broader-it-spending-idUSKCN0VK2EB
637,CSCO,Cisco inks cloud sales deal with Pivotal,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) has struck a deal with Pivotal Software Inc to offer each other’s products in the cloud arena, a sign the giant network company is looking to work with others as it tries to build its presence in one of the fastest-growing areas of computing. The agreement, to be announced later on Tuesday, means the two companies will jointly sell Pivotal Cloud Foundry, which helps developers build and run software on the cloud, and Cisco’s Metapod, a service that lets companies make their data centers more cloud-friendly.  Pivotal’s service helps companies deploy a free, but hard-to-use open-source technology also called Cloud Foundry, much as the free operating system known as Linux generally requires services of a consultant like Red Hat Inc. RHN.N  Pivotal Cloud Foundry competes with services such as IBM’s (IBM.N) Bluemix and HP Enterprise’s (HPE.N) Helion, while Mirantis competes with Metapod. The so-called cloud has become a broad term for quick delivery of data over the Internet, often by sharing computing resources with other companies.  As growth has slowed in Cisco’s main business of switches and routers, in part due to customers turning to technology that relies more on software than hardware, it has looked for business in new areas such as the cloud, often through acquisitions.  It is unclear if Cisco will be able to expand its newer cloud-based offerings at a strong enough rate to make up for weaknesses in its core business.

641,CSCO,Apple's fight with U.S. could speed development of government-proof devices,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The legal showdown between Apple Inc and U.S. law enforcement over encryption, no matter the outcome, will likely accelerate tech company efforts to engineer safeguards against government intrusion, tech industry executives say. Already, an emerging industry is marketing super-secure phones and mobile applications. An Apple executive said the company will strengthen its encryption if it wins its court battle with the federal government, which last week secured a court order requiring Apple engineers to help extract data from a phone associated with the mass shootings in San Bernardino. The executive spoke on condition of anonymity. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment publicly. If Apple loses the court case, the legal precedent could give the U.S. government broad authority to order companies to assist in breaking into encrypted products. But even a government victory could have unintended consequences for law enforcement, potentially prompting a wave of investment by U.S. tech companies in security systems that even their own engineers can’t access, said Jonathan Zittrain, co-founder of Harvard University’s Berkman Center for Internet & Society. “A success for the government in this case may further spur Apple and others to develop devices that the makers aren’t privileged to crack,” he said. The fast-growing online storage provider Box has already made it a priority to give customers sole custody of data, said  Joel De la Garza, chief information security officer at the company. The intent is to make it impossible for the company to access its customers’ data - even under a government order, he said. “Our goal is to achieve a `zero-knowledge’ state” for the company, he said, “where our customers have total control over their data.” It’s unclear whether Apple can - or would even want to - make smartphones the company can’t access. Two Apple employees familiar with the company’s security strategy said the company had no such plans. One immediate beneficiary of the government’s case against Apple is the niche industry, based mostly overseas, that has sprung up to design apps and phones to thwart snooping by governments, business rivals and criminals. In the more than two years since former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden revealed widespread spying via U.S. companies, a handful of companies have released secure phones with names such as BlackPhone, RedPhone or Priv that trumpet security as a prime selling point. Phones such as Boeing Co’s Black target government customers. Blackberry markets the Priv, an Android device, to corporate clients seeking more security. Others include Silent Circle, with launched its Blackphone 2 late last year, and Turing Robotic Industries, whose Turing Phone is due in April. Many more apps, such as Signal and Wickr, encrypt calls or texts messages. Those businesses could surge if the Apple fight drags on. “That’s going to happen,” said Chris Wysopal, cofounder and chief technology officer of software security company Veracode. “People will go out of the country, and there will be a market.” U.S. law enforcement officials have long fought for new laws to maintain access to private information that is harder to capture as people move to digital devices from traditional phone lines - which by law must be tappable. Most recently, the tech industry has fought off numerous efforts to get encryption legislation through Congress, including an attempt last year that died after President Obama declined to support it. FBI Director James Comey has been particularly outspoken in arguing that law enforcement efforts are hobbled by encryption, which he calls a safe haven for terrorists. The FBI did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Other law enforcement officials have said the tech industry fears are exaggerated, or in Apple’s case, even a marketing ploy. Apple, Google, Facebook and other companies also have accelerated efforts to implement encryption in the wake of Snowden’s disclosures about U.S. spying - including a program called Prism that culled private data from some of the largest U.S. tech companies. The revelations prompted companies to fight the perception that they were arms of the government and dented the overseas sales of companies including Cisco and IBM, as countries such as China shunned U.S. products. Apple’s iPhones now have longer passcodes tied to underlying encryption, making them far harder to hack. Facebook’s WhatsApp and others have adopted protocols under which they don’t have the means to unlock user communications. The fight between Apple and the government could give such security efforts a new urgency. It could also undermine trust in automated software updates, which have until now been viewed as one of the best ways to fix security flaws. Because U.S. prosecutors asked Apple to employ a software update as a means to break into the phone tied to the San Bernardino shootings, users now worry that updates could compromise the security of their devices, said Orion Hindawi, chief executive of security firm Tanium. “You are going to see a lot of people who thought auto-update was attractive backing away from that,” he said.

643,CSCO,Apple's fight with U.S. could speed development of government-proof devices,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The legal showdown between Apple Inc (AAPL.O)and U.S. law enforcement over encryption, no matter the outcome, will likely accelerate tech company efforts to engineer safeguards against government intrusion, tech industry executives say. Already, an emerging industry is marketing super-secure phones and mobile applications.  An Apple executive said the company will strengthen its encryption if it wins its court battle with the federal government, which last week secured a court order requiring Apple engineers to help extract data from a phone associated with the mass shootings in San Bernardino.  The executive spoke on condition of anonymity. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment publicly. If Apple loses the court case, the legal precedent could give the U.S. government broad authority to order companies to assist in breaking into encrypted products.  But even a government victory could have unintended consequences for law enforcement, potentially prompting a wave of investment by U.S. tech companies in security systems that even their own engineers can’t access, said Jonathan Zittrain, co-founder of Harvard University’s Berkman Center for Internet & Society. “A success for the government in this case may further spur Apple and others to develop devices that the makers aren’t privileged to crack,” he said. The fast-growing online storage provider Box has already made it a priority to give customers sole custody of data, said  Joel De la Garza, chief information security officer at the company. The intent is to make it impossible for the company to access its customers’ data - even under a government order, he said. “Our goal is to achieve a `zero-knowledge’ state” for the company, he said, “where our customers have total control over their data.” It’s unclear whether Apple can - or would even want to - make smartphones the company can’t access. Two Apple employees familiar with the company’s security strategy said the company had no such plans.  One immediate beneficiary of the government’s case against Apple is the niche industry, based mostly overseas, that has sprung up to design apps and phones to thwart snooping by governments, business rivals and criminals. In the more than two years since former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden revealed widespread spying via U.S. companies, a handful of companies have released secure phones with names such as BlackPhone, RedPhone or Priv that trumpet security as a prime selling point. Phones such as Boeing Co’s(BA.N) Black target government customers. Blackberry(BB.TO) markets the Priv, an Android device, to corporate clients seeking more security. Others include Silent Circle, with launched its Blackphone 2 late last year, and Turing Robotic Industries, whose Turing Phone is due in April. Many more apps, such as Signal and Wickr, encrypt calls or texts messages. Those businesses could surge if the Apple fight drags on. “That’s going to happen,” said Chris Wysopal, cofounder and chief technology officer of software security company Veracode. “People will go out of the country, and there will be a market.” U.S. law enforcement officials have long fought for new laws to maintain access to private information that is harder to capture as people move to digital devices from traditional phone lines - which by law must be tappable. Most recently, the tech industry has fought off numerous efforts to get encryption legislation through Congress, including an attempt last year that died after President Obama declined to support it. FBI Director James Comey has been particularly outspoken in arguing that law enforcement efforts are hobbled by encryption, which he calls a safe haven for terrorists.   The FBI did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Other law enforcement officials have said the tech industry fears are exaggerated, or in Apple’s case, even a marketing ploy.  Apple, Google, Facebook and other companies also have accelerated efforts to implement encryption in the wake of Snowden’s disclosures about U.S. spying - including a program called Prism that culled private data from some of the largest U.S. tech companies.  The revelations prompted companies to fight the perception that they were arms of the government and dented the overseas sales of companies including Cisco (CSCO.O)and IBM(IBM.N), as countries such as China shunned U.S. products. Apple’s iPhones now have longer passcodes tied to underlying encryption, making them far harder to hack.

656,CSCO,Cisco's forecast tops Wall Street estimates; shares rise,"(Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc reported better-than-expected results and gave an upbeat forecast for the current quarter, sending its shares up about 7 percent in extended trading. The company has been beefing up its wireless security and datacenter businesses to offset the impact of sluggish spending by telecom carriers and enterprises on its main business of making network switches and routers. Results in the latest reported quarter were mainly driven by a 17 percent jump in sales in its security business, which offers firewall protection as well as intrusion detection and prevention systems. “Security is and will remain one of our absolute highest priorities,” Chief Executive Chuck Robbins said on a post-earnings conference call on Wednesday. Revenue in the company’s collaboration unit, which sells IP phones, rose 10 percent in the third quarter ended April 30. Sales in the data center business, which makes servers, rose 1 percent. The company’s legacy switches and routers business is still by far its largest, accounting for nearly 60 percent of total revenue. Sales in the switching unit fell 3 percent, while router sales fell 5 percent, painting a grim picture of corporate technology spending. “Security and Collaboration were definitely the bright spot. But I am really concerned about the switching and routing business. They are the company’s biggest and important units,” Needham Co analyst Alex Henderson said. Cisco said it expects an adjusted profit of 59-61 cents per share and revenue to range from flat to up 3 percent. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 58 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. On revenue, analysts had projected a 3 percent decline. Henderson said the outlook seemed cautious. “What they are basically saying is they do not see any significant improvement in economic slowdown.” The company’s net profit fell to $2.35 billion, or 46 cents per share, in the third quarter, from $2.44 billion, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier.

664,CSCO,"Supreme Court's Alito sells oil company shares, documents show","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito sold his shares in Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) worth up to $250,000 that had prompted him to step aside from cases involving the oil company, financial disclosure forms released on Wednesday showed. Justice Clarence Thomas received a bronze bust of 19th century slavery abolitionist and writer Frederick Douglass from a wealthy Dallas real estate developer, and other justices took expensive overseas trips during 2015, the documents stated. Justices periodically recuse themselves from cases in which they might have a financial conflict of interest, such as when they own shares in a company involved in a case before the  court. Alito recused himself from a 2008 case in which the court cut the punitive damages imposed against Exxon Mobil for the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill off Alaska from $2.5 billion to about $500 million.  In the court’s current term, Alito recused himself in an electricity markets regulation case, likely due to his ownership of shares in auto parts maker Johnson Controls Inc, which was involved in the dispute. Alito also stepped aside in a Puerto Rico debt-restructuring law case because of his investments in funds with assets in Puerto Rico municipal bonds. The bronze Douglass bust, estimated to be worth $6,500, was given to Thomas by businessman Harlan Crow, a contributor to conservative causes and a friend of the justice. Justice Elena Kagan also received an expensive gift: a signed copy of a book by one of her predecessors on the court, Justice Felix Frankfurter, who died in 1965. It was given to her by the University of Chicago Law School, where she once worked. The documents showed that Alito, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Stephen Breyer continue to hold stocks in various companies. Alito also sold stocks in Target Corp and Sysco Corp, among others. Breyer sold Johnson Controls Inc and some of his IBM Corp shares.  The forms provide indications as to why justices recused themselves in certain cases. Breyer, for example, did not participate in a patent case involving Cisco Systems Inc, presumably because he owns shares in the company. Roberts’ form showed he had not sold shares in Microsoft Corp worth between $250,000 and $500,000 by the end of 2015. In January, he participated when the court agreed to hear a class action case involving the company, suggesting he has since sold those shares. Breyer, whose latest book was published last year, earned just over $120,000 via book royalties and a payment from his publisher.

Justice Clarence Thomas received a bronze bust of 19th century slavery abolitionist and writer Frederick Douglass from a wealthy Dallas real estate developer, and other justices took expensive overseas trips during 2015, the documents stated. Justices periodically recuse themselves from cases in which they might have a financial conflict of interest, such as when they own shares in a company involved in a case before the  court. Alito recused himself from a 2008 case in which the court cut the punitive damages imposed against Exxon Mobil for the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill off Alaska from $2.5 billion to about $500 million.  In the court’s current term, Alito recused himself in an electricity markets regulation case, likely due to his ownership of shares in auto parts maker Johnson Controls Inc, which was involved in the dispute. Alito also stepped aside in a Puerto Rico debt-restructuring law case because of his investments in funds with assets in Puerto Rico municipal bonds. The bronze Douglass bust, estimated to be worth $6,500, was given to Thomas by businessman Harlan Crow, a contributor to conservative causes and a friend of the justice. Justice Elena Kagan also received an expensive gift: a signed copy of a book by one of her predecessors on the court, Justice Felix Frankfurter, who died in 1965. It was given to her by the University of Chicago Law School, where she once worked. The documents showed that Alito, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Stephen Breyer continue to hold stocks in various companies. Alito also sold stocks in Target Corp and Sysco Corp, among others. Breyer sold Johnson Controls Inc and some of his IBM Corp shares.  The forms provide indications as to why justices recused themselves in certain cases. Breyer, for example, did not participate in a patent case involving Cisco Systems Inc, presumably because he owns shares in the company. Roberts’ form showed he had not sold shares in Microsoft Corp worth between $250,000 and $500,000 by the end of 2015. In January, he participated when the court agreed to hear a class action case involving the company, suggesting he has since sold those shares. Breyer, whose latest book was published last year, earned just over $120,000 via book royalties and a payment from his publisher.

666,CSCO,"Arista infringes Cisco networking patents, U.S. trade agency rules","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc won a key victory in a sprawling legal battle with rival Arista Networks Inc on Thursday after the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled Arista infringed three of Cisco’s patents with its ethernet switches used in computer data centers and servers. The trade commission upheld a finding of infringement by a U.S. trade judge in February. The ITC, which investigates complaints of violations of U.S. intellectual property, also recommended an import ban against Arista’s products that infringe the patents. The ITC’s ruling must now be reviewed by the U.S. Trade Representative, who can approve or disapprove of the commission’s orders. Arista was down more than 3 percent to $71.50 in after-hours trading, while Cisco was unchanged. Cisco’s patents relate to managing and securing communications networks. The company filed its trade complaint in December, 2014, seeking a ban on Arista’s switches. The ruling, if approved, could lead to the exclusion of Arista’s 7000 series of switches, which generate most of the company’s product revenue, according to regulatory filings. Arista, however, has said it redesigned the software in its switches to address the ITC’s findings. Cisco says Arista has not presented its purported redesigns to the ITC. “This marks the end of Arista’s ability to mislead its shareholders and customers about the infringing nature of their products,” Cisco senior vice president Mark Chandler said in a statement. Arista said it intends to comply with the orders. The company’s senior vice president Marc Taxay said in a statement that Cisco was using litigation to preserve its market share. “If allowed to succeed, Cisco’s scheme would have a chilling effect on innovation. While we will defend our rights in these actions, our primary focus remains on the continued supply of products to our customers.” The trade action is one front in a fierce legal battle between Cisco and Arista, which was formed by former Cisco employees. Cisco has a second trade-related investigation pending, and a judge is scheduled to release findings in that case in August. The companies, both based in California, have also sued each other in federal court in San Jose. Arista has requested the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office review the validity of several Cisco patents. Companies frequently turn to the ITC to win an import ban and to district court to win damages.

Thales generates 500 million euros ($550 million) annually in the cybersecurity business, notably in data protection thanks to the acquisition in March of Vormetric for 375 million euros.

675,CSCO,"Big tech may halt earnings recession, if it delivers Q3 numbers","NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Technology heavyweights might be all that keeps the U.S. earnings recession from extending into a fifth quarter in September if they hit the higher estimates Wall Street is calling for.  A bright spot in generally dour second-quarter results reported so far, technology is the only sector showing improved third-quarter analyst expectations, mostly because of strong scorecards recently from Facebook Inc (FB.O), Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O) and others. Analysts’ third-quarter expectations for all other sectors have been deteriorating since last year on worries about slower global growth and the strength of the U.S. dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data, though profit growth still is expected in consumer discretionary, materials and other sectors. Earnings across the S&P; 500 are now seen growing just 0.2 percent in the third quarter over the same quarter a year ago, down from an estimate of 2 percent growth a month ago. Technology profits, which this year have been the biggest contributor to S&P; 500 earnings after financials, are now seen growing 3.1 percent in the third quarter, up from the 2.4 percent growth predicted a month ago.  Without the contribution of leaders like Alphabet and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), for example, the entire index might show another quarter of slowing profit growth. Investors have been predicting that S&P; 500 aggregate earnings would start to grow again in the third quarter of this year after starting to shrink in the third quarter of 2015. The second quarter, mostly over, is on track to show a 2.4 percent decline.  Wall Street has been banking on fatter corporate profits to justify pricey valuations following a recent rally that has propelled the S&P; 500 to record highs. Part of the reason for strength in the tech sector may be related to the weight of just a few larger players. In 2015, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft, Alphabet, IBM (IBM.N) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) pulled in combined earnings of $125 billion, equivalent to over half of all profits in the sector, according to a Thomson Reuters analysis. “They have just become such powerful, dominant market players that they don’t face quite the pressures of other companies,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.  “In the case of Facebook and Google, they continue to just steal share, advertising share, from traditional sources. So they are truly shifting the pie towards them,” he said. All those companies beat Wall Street’s earnings expectations for the June quarter, except for Cisco, which is expected to report its quarterly results on Aug. 17. Its earnings per share beat expectations in at least the past eight quarters, according to Thomson Reuters data. Tech’s improving outlook has been noted on Wall Street, where the tech-heavy Nasdaq has risen 12 percent since its June 27 post-Brexit referendum low. “Tech looks attractive,” said Kristina Hooper, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors. “Technology offers better values, especially when you factor in growth estimates.” ",8032016,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-results-tech/big-tech-may-halt-earnings-recession-if-it-delivers-q3-numbers-idUSL1N1AJ120

677,CSCO,"Cisco to cut 5,500 jobs in shift from switches to software","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc said it would cut nearly 7 percent of its workforce, posting charges of up to $400 million in its first quarter, as the world’s largest networking gear maker shifts focus from its legacy hardware towards higher-margin software. The gradual move to fast-growing sectors such as security, the Internet of Things and the cloud is a response to sluggish demand for Cisco’s traditional lineup of switches and routers from telecom carriers and enterprise customers, amid intense competition from companies such as Huawei and Juniper Networks Inc. Savings from up to 5,500 job cuts would be reinvested into key growth areas, Cisco said. “We think this is partly an effort by (CEO) Chuck Robbins to put a stake in the ground and send a message that this is going to be a leaner, meaner Cisco that is focused on driving software and recurring revenue business,” said Guggenheim Securities analyst Ryan Hutchinson. Revenue at the company’s routers business fell 6 percent in the fourth-quarter ended July 30, while switching unit revenue was up 2 percent. Orders from service providers fell 5 percent, while revenue in emerging markets fell 6 percent, Cisco said. Cisco projected flat revenue in the first quarter and gave an earnings forecast that was shy of analysts’ estimates, saying it expected adjusted earnings of 58 cents to 60 cents per share, versus Wall Street estimates of 60 cents. “We’re uncertain how to model any improvement in those two (segments) in particular going forward,” Robbins told analysts on a call, speaking of service providers and emerging markets.  Robbins, who took over from John Chambers in July last year, has been steering Cisco toward more software and subscription-based services. Security, which Robbins said was the top priority of all its customers, posted a revenue gain of 16 percent in the quarter.  Gross and operating margins also improved in the fourth quarter, reflecting cost savings, Cisco said. “It’s part of what we’re driving in our shift to software,” said Chief Financial Officer Kelly Kramer. “Those businesses have great margins and it’s part of the overall transition.” Cisco, which is also betting on acquisitions to fast-track growth, has made 10 acquisitions since Robbins began as CEO, according to FactSet StreetAccount data, from Internet-of-Things startup Jasper Technologies to cloud security provider CloudLock. Shares of the company were down 1.4 percent in after-hours trade to $30.30. The shares had gained 13.2 percent this year through Wednesday’s close, compared with the 6.8 percent increase in the broader S&P; 500 index.     Cisco’s fourth-quarter net profit rose to $2.81 billion, or 56 cents per share, from $2.32 billion, or 45 cents, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 63 cents per share. Revenue fell 1.6 percent to $12.64 billion.  Analysts on average had expected a profit of 60 cents and revenue of $12.58 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Cisco, which expects to start laying off employees from the first quarter, said it will take a charge of about $325 million to $400 million in the quarter. On the whole, the company expects a pretax charge of $700 million. Hutchinson said it was “relatively unlikely” there would be more job cuts until the end of the fiscal year, barring unforeseen macroeconomic events.

687,CSCO,"U.S. Trade Rep approves import ban on Arista devices, says rival Cisco","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Trade Representative has upheld an import ban on Arista Networks Inc’s ethernet switches following a federal commission’s finding in June that the company’s products infringed patents owned by rival Cisco Systems Inc, Cisco said. The decision by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), which investigates purported violations of U.S. intellectual property, stemmed from a complaint Cisco filed in December 2014 about the switches, which are used in computer data centers and servers. In a blog post on the company’s website on Monday, Cisco general counsel Mark Chandler said the import ban was to start on Tuesday. Representatives for the USTR could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday. The ITC said Arista infringed three Cisco patents relating to managing and securing communications networks. The ruling excludes the import of Arista’s network devices, including its 7000 series of switches, which generates most of that company’s product revenue, according to regulatory filings. It also prevents the sale of domestic supplies of the imported products. In a statement on Tuesday, Arista’s general counsel, Marc Taxay, said the company has redesigned the software in its switches and believes it is in “full compliance” with the ITC’s orders. “Our primary focus remains the continued supply of non-infringing products to our customers,” he said. Arista also said it would appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Cisco’s Chandler, in his blog post, said that “it appears Cisco’s proprietary technology is still being used.” He said Arista has not received approval from the ITC for the redesigned products.

Toronto-based Barrick said it planned to spend around $100 million between now and the end of 2017 working with Cisco to embed technology in various parts of its operations to deliver better, faster and safer mining. Mining sector players have long lamented the lack of technological innovation in the industry although some miners such as Dundee Precious Metals (DPM.TO) have started using wireless technology and software platforms to track underground operations in real time. “Barrick of three years ago is going to be very, very different indeed going forward,” Barrick Chief Operating Officer Richard Williams said in an interview.  “We think actually that all mining companies will have to do the same if they are going to remain in existence,” he said. The technology project is the latest move by Barrick Chairman John Thornton to transform the miner into a profitable, low-cost producer after cost-blow outs, overpriced acquisitions and a weak gold price knocked 80 percent off its share price between 2010 and late-2015.   Williams said the technology initiative will help Barrick meet its target of reducing its all-in sustaining costs to below $700 per ounce of gold by 2019.   Barrick’s Cortez gold mine in Nevada will be the first operation where it will roll out new technology. Early projects there include using technology to predict maintenance in its fleet of haul trucks to reduce down time, said Michelle Ash, Barrick’s senior vice president of transformation and innovation. The company also plans to set up a central data repository where any Barrick employee can access any piece of data across any site. “At the moment it sometimes takes us weeks to compile as all our data is in silos and you have to access to that particular silo, and we have hundreds of them,” Ash said in an interview. Barrick said the technological shift will help it reduce its environmental impact and allow it to be more transparent with indigenous communities, local governments and non-governmental organizations.

705,CSCO,UPDATE 3-Ericsson crisis deepens as profits plunge 94 pct,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The crisis at Ericsson (ERICb.ST) deepened on Wednesday when the world’s biggest maker of mobile network equipment reported a 94 percent plunge in quarterly operating profit and tumbling sales. The Swedish company is struggling with a drop in spending by telecoms companies, with new 5G technology still years away, and stiff competition from Finland’s Nokia and China’s Huawei. Its shares dropped more than 15 percent to an eight year low in early trading after it missed analysts’ forecasts for a fifth straight quarter and said it saw no sign of a quick upturn. Having been slower to cut costs than recently merged rivals Nokia and Alcatel, Ericsson ousted Hans Vestberg as chief executive in July. It has since announced plans to axe thousands of jobs, but analysts said third-quarter results showed the challenges facing the firm as it looks for a new leader. “Now the market is pressuring them for transformation and clarifying what they are, and what they need to do,” said Gartner analyst Sylvain Fabre. “It’s a case of being a little more clear of what they want to do when they grow up.” Acting CEO Jan Frykhammar was confident Ericsson could fight back, noting it had faced a similar situation in 2007-2009 when it was waiting for demand for 4G technology to kick in.  “This is absolutely not the beginning of the end for Ericsson,” he said on a call with analysts and media. Ericsson said third-quarter operating income plunged to 300 million Swedish crowns ($34.8 million) from 5.1 billion crowns a year ago, including restructuring charges of 1.3 billion crowns. Sales dropped 14 percent to 51.1 billion crowns, including an almost 20 percent drop in its core networks division.  Analysts’ mean forecasts were for operating income of 4.3 billion crowns and sales of 53.6 billion. Ericsson said sales fell most in markets with weakening economies such as Brazil, Russia and the Middle East. Sales in Europe were hit by the completion of mobile broadband projects in 2015. Frykhammar said current market trends were expected to continue in the short term, suggesting two to three quarters. Mikael Rautanen, an analyst at Inderes Equity Research, said the results did not bode well for Nokia (NOKIA.HE), whose shares fell more than 4 percent on Wednesday. But he added the Finnish firm was less dependent on mobile broadband demand than Ericsson as its merger with Alcatel gave it a bigger fixed-line network business. With Ericsson struggling and its stock sliding, speculation has resurfaced it could be a bid target for Cisco Systems (CSCO.O), the world’s biggest supplier of data network gear.  The two firms struck a sales partnership last year, but some analysts say this has yet to produce meaningful results and there are few benefits that would justify Cisco paying a premium for Ericsson shares. “We would rarely rule out speculated consolidation but feel it is unlikely,” UBS analysts said, adding there was a lack of overlap between the two businesses and Cisco’s prized 30 percent operating profit margin would only be dragged lower by Ericsson. At 1030 GMT, Ericsson’s shares were down 17.3 percent at 51.10 crowns, after trading as low as 50.50 crowns. The stock has fallen around 36 percent this year.  “Unless Ericsson can provide a solid explanation to why the gross margin should rebound during early parts of 2017 and why the market should pick up ... we see clear risk that the share will come down sub 50 crowns as estimates will have to come down heavily and (the) dividend likely will have to be cut,” SEB analysts said.

719,CSCO,U.S. trade judge rules Arista infringes more Cisco network patents,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Arista Networks Inc used rival Cisco Systems Inc’s network device technology in its ethernet switches without permission, a U.S. trade judge ruled on Friday, handing Cisco yet another win in a sprawling legal battle over patents between the two companies. The judge, MaryJoan McNamara of the U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington, said that Arista had infringed two patents owned by Cisco. The ruling, which must be reviewed by the full commission over the next few months, could lead to an order banning the import of Arista’s products into the United States.  Cisco filed the complaint at the ITC in December 2014, alleging that Arista was infringing six of its patents, which relate to improving the speed and performance of networked computers and devices.  The products accused of infringement include Arista’s 7000 series of switches, which generate most of that company’s revenues.  In a statement, Arista general counsel Marc Taxay said the company looks forward to presenting its case to the full commission. “We...strongly believe that our products do not infringe any of the patents under investigation,” he said.  Cisco’s general counsel, Mark Chandler, said, “Our goal has always been to protect technological innovation, and stop Arista from using our patented technology.” Friday’s ruling comes after the ITC in June, in a separate case, ordered an import ban on Arista’s products that infringed several other Cisco patents.  The U.S. Trade Representative allowed that order to go ahead in August, but U.S. customs officials last month ruled that Arista could resume imports of its redesigned switches because they were not within the scope of the ban.  Arista was trading down less than 1 percent to $93.75 after hours on Friday. Cisco’s stock was unchanged. The companies are also sparring in a trial that is currently underway in federal court in California, where both are based.  Arista is defending against claims of copyright and patent infringement brought by Cisco. The trial is expected to wrap up next week.   Companies frequently turn to the ITC to win an import ban and to district court to win damages. The case at the U.S. International Trade Commission is 337-945.

720,CSCO,U.S. jury sides with Arista over Cisco in copyright battle,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. jury on Wednesday handed Arista Networks Inc a major win in a wide-ranging legal battle against Cisco Systems Inc, ruling that Arista owed no damages over Cisco’s claims of copyright infringement. The jurors in federal court in San Jose, California also found that Arista did not infringe a Cisco patent. The verdict is the latest in sprawling litigation between San Jose-based Cisco, a major networking equipment company, and Santa Clara, California-based Arista, a fast-growing rival. The companies compete fiercely to sell ethernet switches to connect computers, servers and other devices, forming networks. Cisco had been seeking roughly $335 million in damages over Arista copyright infringement of its user interfaces. In a statement, Cisco said it respectfully disagreed with the verdict and was determining its options for post-trial motions and appeal. Arista said the outcome “represents an important victory not only for Arista but for the entire industry.” Arista shares closed up about 3 percent while Cisco shares declined 0.4 percent. Cisco is fighting to preserve its position as a dominant market player, and to brush off a rival founded by former top Cisco executives. Arista’s annual revenue has jumped 43 percent since 2014, the year it went public, to $837 million at the end of 2015.  During a two-week trial in a San Jose courtroom, Cisco argued that Arista “slavishly copied” its command line interfaces (CLI) - one- or two-word commands for operating its network switches - and that Arista’s switches and routers infringe one of its patents for user interface technology. Arista denied infringing Cisco’s intellectual property. The jury found that Arista infringed some of Cisco’s copyrights. However, jurors also said Arista proved that external factors, other than Cisco’s creativity, dictated the design of Cisco’s content.  That legal defense, known as “scenes a faire,” meant Arista owed no damages to Cisco.  The lawsuit is one of two Cisco filed in 2014 in San Jose that together accused Arista of infringing on 14 of its networking patents and related copyrights. Cisco had also filed twin complaints at the U.S. International Trade Commission, which handed the networking giant a victory in June in one of the cases. The commission said Arista’s ethernet switches, which carry data traffic, infringed three of Cisco’s patents. Last week, an ITC judge again sided with Cisco by ruling Arista had infringed two other Cisco patents. That decision must be reviewed by the full commission over the next few months.

725,CSCO,REFILE-Cisco AppDynamics deal seeks to boost ratio of software revenue," (This January 25 story was refiled to correct misspelling in headline) By Stephen Nellis (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc’s decision to acquire software startup AppDynamics for $3.7 billion, nearly double the private-market valuation, reflects Cisco’s struggles in building its software business, according to company financial reports and internal documents. The push by Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins to boost the share of revenues from software stalled in the most recent quarter. Executives on its earnings call said 29 percent of Cisco’s $12.4 billion in fiscal first quarter revenues came from recurring software and services. That was barely up from 28 percent in the previous quarter, which was only a slight increase from 25 percent a year earlier. One of Cisco’s key product lines is dramatically underperforming that software revenue ratio, according to an internal document reviewed by Reuters. Cisco’s N9000 switch uses a mix of hardware and software to route information to data centers. Cisco paid $863 million in 2013 for the technology from a startup named Insieme, hoping to boost software revenue in its networking division. But the document showed that as of the end of fiscal 2016 year last summer, Cisco had $888 million in contracts for N9000 switches, which does include a software component, but only $89 million in connected contracts for the so-called Application Centric Infrastructure software product designed to be sold alongside it. Those numbers suggest a software-to-hardware revenue ratio of about 10 percent, below Cisco’s overall average. A company spokesman would not comment on unreleased financial figures or say what percentage of switch revenue comes from software. While the N9000 switch will be a small part of Cisco’s revenue, the lagging software component could help explain why Cisco was eager to pay a premium for AppDynamics. Cisco spokesman Jim Brady noted that in its most recent quarter, the amount of deferred revenue attributable to recurring software sales grew 48 percent, an indicator that software revenue will grow. “As we continue to evolve our business toward a more software-centric, recurring revenue model, we are very pleased with our incremental growth in this area,” Brady said. “We feel the acquisition of AppDynamics ... will also accelerate our transition toward software-based solutions that deliver predictable and recurring revenue.” AppDynamics, whose software helps monitor how fast apps run on servers, had been valued at $1.9 billion in its most recent round of private financing. Cisco swooped in with an all-cash offer for nearly double its valuation just as it was about to go public as AppDynamics Inc.

726,CSCO,Cisco pays fantastical price to capture unicorn,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Cisco Systems is chasing a fairy tale. The networking giant’s core switch and router businesses face tough times. Buying software firm AppDynamics for $3.7 billion offers some respite from hardware woes. But the company is paying well over the odds to add a bit of excitement to its story. Cisco’s revenue has stagnated over the past several years. Switches and routing account for more than 45 percent of sales, and demand for these is tepid. Virtual networking software reduces enterprises’ need for high-end hardware. Chinese gear makers compete fiercely on the cheap end. The company, under Chief Executive Chuck Robbins, has tried to compensate by growing its software operations. AppDynamics fits the bill. The company’s software allows enterprises to monitor and manage the performance of applications. It’s a fast-growing business, and better yet, most revenue comes in the form of sticky subscriptions. That’s the sort of combination investors love. The problem is the price. Cisco snatched the firm up literally on the eve of its IPO. At the top of the indicated range, the company’s market value would have been a bit above $2 billion, including outstanding equity grants. The stock might have priced above that range and popped once it floated, considering the paucity of tech listings over the past year. But Cisco paid a substantial premium to prevent this possibility – handing a big payday to AppDynamics and advisor Qatalyst. AppDynamics is losing money - $95 million over the nine months ending Oct. 31 - and burning cash, albeit at a slower rate. So let’s look at the price as a multiple of revenue. The outfit had about $200 million in revenue over the past 12 months and is growing around 50 percent annually. Assuming it can maintain that pace, Cisco is paying some 12 times estimated revenue. Relic, a similar software firm that’s growing about as fast, is valued at roughly five times estimated revenue. It will take several years of rapid growth and improving margins for Cisco to earn a decent return on its unicorn purchase. Such a happy ending would be magical, but looks improbable.",1252017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-appdynamics-m-a-breakingviews/cisco-pays-fantastical-price-to-capture-unicorn-idUSKBN1592ML
727,CSCO,Cisco to buy AppDynamics for $3.7 billion in growth push,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) said on Tuesday that it agreed to buy U.S. business software company AppDynamics Inc for about $3.7 billion, making one of its largest deals of recent years as it searches for growth beyond its core networking business. Legacy technology players like Cisco have been trying to shift their strategy to stay ahead of technology developments, such as the rise of cloud computing, that could otherwise threaten their core businesses.  Cisco’s announcement comes a week after Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE.N) said it would buy cloud startup SimpliVity for $650 million in cash. President Donald Trump’s plan to incentivize U.S. companies to repatriate their overseas cash could spur a new wave of dealmaking for large tech companies like Cisco, analysts say.   Rob Salvagno, Cisco’s vice president of corporate development, said in an interview that the acquisition fits Cisco’s long-term direction and its transition toward software. AppDynamics makes software that manages and analyzes applications and it has about 2,000 paying customers, including NASDAQ Inc, Nike Inc and its new owner, Cisco.  Cisco swooped in to buy AppDynamics the day before the San Franciso-based firm was planning to price its long-planned IPO. The company has been on its road show with investors.  “The fact that they were in their IPO process represented a window where we needed to make a decision,” Cisco’s Salvagno said. The $3.7 billion offer from Cisco is nearly double the $1.9 billion valuation AppDynamics received in its last financing round in November 2015. Cisco’s offer comes out to roughly $26 per share, higher than the estimated $12 to $14 per share range it was planning. “Cisco made an offer that people felt was compelling,” said Ravi Mhatre, a board member at AppDynamics from LightSpeed Venture Partners. RBC analyst Mitch Steves said in a research note that while the price for AppDynamics “appears to be high,” he views more software revenue as a positive for Cisco. AppDynamics will become part of Cisco’s Internet of Things and Applications Unit, reporting to Rowan Trollope. Cisco’s last large acquisition, Jasper, is also part of that unit.  It is Cisco’s largest acquisition since it bought security company Sourcefire for $2.7 billion in 2013.  Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Qatalyst advised AppDynamics while Fenwick & West was Cisco’s legal adviser. The deal, which is a mix of cash and equity, is expected to close by April.

Cisco’s announcement comes a week after Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE.N) said it would buy cloud startup SimpliVity for $650 million in cash. President Donald Trump’s plan to incentivize U.S. companies to repatriate their overseas cash could spur a new wave of dealmaking for large tech companies like Cisco, analysts say.   Rob Salvagno, Cisco’s vice president of corporate development, said in an interview that the acquisition fits Cisco’s long-term direction and its transition toward software. AppDynamics makes software that manages and analyzes applications and it has about 2,000 paying customers, including NASDAQ Inc, Nike Inc and its new owner, Cisco.  Cisco swooped in to buy AppDynamics the day before the San Franciso-based firm was planning to price its long-planned IPO. The company has been on its road show with investors.  “The fact that they were in their IPO process represented a window where we needed to make a decision,” Cisco’s Salvagno said. The $3.7 billion offer from Cisco is nearly double the $1.9 billion valuation AppDynamics received in its last financing round in November 2015. Cisco’s offer comes out to roughly $26 per share, higher than the estimated $12 to $14 per share range it was planning. “Cisco made an offer that people felt was compelling,” said Ravi Mhatre, a board member at AppDynamics from LightSpeed Venture Partners. RBC analyst Mitch Steves said in a research note that while the price for AppDynamics “appears to be high,” he views more software revenue as a positive for Cisco. AppDynamics will become part of Cisco’s Internet of Things and Applications Unit, reporting to Rowan Trollope. Cisco’s last large acquisition, Jasper, is also part of that unit.  It is Cisco’s largest acquisition since it bought security company Sourcefire for $2.7 billion in 2013.  Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Qatalyst advised AppDynamics while Fenwick & West was Cisco’s legal adviser. The deal, which is a mix of cash and equity, is expected to close by April.

731,CSCO,Cisco AppDynamics deal seeks to boost ratio of software revenue," (This January 25 story was refiled to correct misspelling in headline) By Stephen Nellis (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc’s decision to acquire software startup AppDynamics for $3.7 billion, nearly double the private-market valuation, reflects Cisco’s struggles in building its software business, according to company financial reports and internal documents. The push by Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins to boost the share of revenues from software stalled in the most recent quarter. Executives on its earnings call said 29 percent of Cisco’s $12.4 billion in fiscal first quarter revenues came from recurring software and services. That was barely up from 28 percent in the previous quarter, which was only a slight increase from 25 percent a year earlier. One of Cisco’s key product lines is dramatically underperforming that software revenue ratio, according to an internal document reviewed by Reuters. Cisco’s N9000 switch uses a mix of hardware and software to route information to data centers. Cisco paid $863 million in 2013 for the technology from a startup named Insieme, hoping to boost software revenue in its networking division. But the document showed that as of the end of fiscal 2016 year last summer, Cisco had $888 million in contracts for N9000 switches, which does include a software component, but only $89 million in connected contracts for the so-called Application Centric Infrastructure software product designed to be sold alongside it. Those numbers suggest a software-to-hardware revenue ratio of about 10 percent, below Cisco’s overall average. A company spokesman would not comment on unreleased financial figures or say what percentage of switch revenue comes from software. While the N9000 switch will be a small part of Cisco’s revenue, the lagging software component could help explain why Cisco was eager to pay a premium for AppDynamics. Cisco spokesman Jim Brady noted that in its most recent quarter, the amount of deferred revenue attributable to recurring software sales grew 48 percent, an indicator that software revenue will grow. “As we continue to evolve our business toward a more software-centric, recurring revenue model, we are very pleased with our incremental growth in this area,” Brady said. “We feel the acquisition of AppDynamics ... will also accelerate our transition toward software-based solutions that deliver predictable and recurring revenue.” AppDynamics, whose software helps monitor how fast apps run on servers, had been valued at $1.9 billion in its most recent round of private financing. Cisco swooped in with an all-cash offer for nearly double its valuation just as it was about to go public as AppDynamics Inc.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.2 percent at 374.20 points by 0930 GMT after setting an intra-day high of 375.42 points, the highest level since early December 2015. Germany’s DAX was up 0.3 percent after hitting levels not seen since April 2015. Telefonica Deutschland was one of the best-performing stocks, up 5.8 percent and set for its best day in four months after it reported better than expected core profit for the fourth quarter and raised its target for synergies from its acquisition of E-Plus. ThyssenKrupp was also a top gainer, up 5.4 percent at a 19-month high after the German industrials and steel company said it had sold its Brazilian steel mill to Ternium , ending five years of unsuccessful efforts by the German company to exit Latin America’s largest economy. Fresenius Medical added to the strong German stock performance, up 3.8 percent after the healthcare group said 2016 sales rose 5 percent, adding that it has targeted double-digit annual gains by 2020. The disposal price, 1.26 billion euros ($1.33 billion), was above UBS analysts’ estimates. “For us, it is an important step forward to clean up ThyssenKrupp’s comprehensive business portfolio and reduces earnings volatility going forward,” wrote analysts in a note. British events and marketing company UBM was up 5 percent, the second best-performing European stock, after reporting a 19.2 percent rise in profits for 2016. Shares in French insurance company Scor hit a 14-month high, up 5.6 percent after it raised its dividend and said it planned share buybacks due to a 5.4 percent increase in premiums. Ericsson was up 3.7 percent, extending Tuesday’s gains on speculation that U.S. telecomms giant Cisco could buy the Swedish tech company, and on a positive note from Haitong Research, which initiated a ‘buy’ rating on the stock, saying catalysts over the next two years could cause Ericsson’s share price to double. Lloyds, the second largest British listed bank to post earnings this week, was a top gainer, up 3.3 percent after impressing investors with profits rising to a ten-year high. Italy’s blue-chip index underperformed its European peers, down 0.5 percent as asset manager Banca Mediolanum  fell 4.3 percent after Kepler Cheuvreux cut its target price on the stock on concern over a possible fall in 2018 fees. The shares plunged on Tuesday after the CEO flagged the risk. Peers Azimut and Banco BPM were among top European fallers, down 3.2 to 3.7 percent. Indivior was an outlier in generally buoyant markets. The British pharmaceuticals company was down 13.4 percent, the top European faller, after its results.

738,CSCO,A scramble at Cisco exposes uncomfortable truths about U.S. cyber defense,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - When WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange disclosed earlier this month that his anti-secrecy group had obtained CIA tools for hacking into technology products made by U.S. companies, security engineers at Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) swung into action.  The Wikileaks documents described how the Central Intelligence Agency had learned more than a year ago how to exploit flaws in Cisco’s widely used Internet switches, which direct electronic traffic, to enable eavesdropping. Senior Cisco managers immediately reassigned staff from other projects to figure out how the CIA hacking tricks worked, so they could help customers patch their systems and prevent criminal hackers or spies from using the same methods, three employees told Reuters on condition of anonymity. The Cisco engineers worked around the clock for days to analyze the means of attack, create fixes, and craft a stopgap warning about a security risk affecting more than 300 different products, said the employees, who had direct knowledge of the effort.  That a major U.S. company had to rely on WikiLeaks to learn about security problems well-known to U.S. intelligence agencies underscores concerns expressed by dozens of current and former U.S. intelligence and security officials about the government’s approach to cybersecurity. That policy overwhelmingly emphasizes offensive cyber-security capabilities over defensive measures, these people told Reuters, even as an increasing number of U.S. organizations have been hit by hacks attributed to foreign governments. Larry Pfeiffer, a former senior director of the White House Situation Room in the Obama administration, said now that others were catching up to the United States in their cyber capabilities, “maybe it is time to take a pause and fully consider the ramifications of what we’re doing.” U.S. intelligence agencies blamed Russia for the hack of the  Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election. Nation-states are also believed to be behind the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment and the 2015 breach of the U.S. Government’s Office of Personnel Management.  CIA spokeswoman Heather Fritz Horniak declined to comment on the Cisco case, but said it was the agency’s “job to be innovative, cutting-edge, and the first line of defense in protecting this country from enemies abroad.” The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the CIA and NSA, referred questions to the White House, which declined to comment. Across the federal government, about 90 percent of all spending on cyber programs is dedicated to offensive efforts, including penetrating the computer systems of adversaries, listening to communications and developing the means to disable or degrade infrastructure, senior intelligence officials told Reuters. President Donald Trump’s budget proposal would put about $1.5 billion into cyber-security defense at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Private industry and the military also spend money to protect themselves. But the secret part of the U.S. intelligence budget alone totaled about $50 billion annually as of 2013, documents leaked by NSA contractor Edward Snowden show. Just 8 percent of that figure went toward “enhanced cyber security,” while 72 percent was dedicated to collecting strategic intelligence and fighting violent extremism.   Departing NSA Deputy Director Rick Ledgett confirmed in an interview that 90 percent of government cyber spending was on offensive efforts and agreed it was lopsided. “It’s actually something we’re trying to address” with more appropriations in the military budget, Ledgett said. “As the cyber threat rises, the need for more and better cyber defense and information assurance is increasing as well.” The long-standing emphasis on offense stems in part from the  mission of the NSA, which has the most advanced cyber capabilities of any U.S. agency. It is responsible for the collection of intelligence overseas and also for helping defend government systems. It mainly aids U.S. companies indirectly, by assisting other agencies. “I absolutely think we should be placing significantly more effort on the defense, particularly in light of where we are with exponential growth in threats and capabilities and intentions,” said Debora Plunkett, who headed the NSA’s defensive mission from 2010 to 2014. How big a role the government should play in defending the private sector remains a matter of debate. Former military and intelligence leaders such as ex-NSA Director Keith Alexander and former Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter say that U.S. companies and other institutions cannot be solely responsible for defending themselves against the likes of Russia, China, North Korea and Iran. For tech companies, the government’s approach is frustrating, executives and engineers say. Sophisticated hacking campaigns typically rely on flaws in computer products. When the NSA or CIA find such flaws, under current policies they often choose to keep them for offensive attacks, rather than tell the companies.  In the case of Cisco, the company said the CIA did not inform the company after the agency learned late last year that information about the hacking tools had been leaked. “Cisco remains steadfast in the position that we should be notified of all vulnerabilities if they are found, so we can fix them and notify customers,” said company spokeswoman Yvonne Malmgren. A recent reorganization at the NSA, known as NSA21, eliminated the branch that was explicitly responsible for defense, the Information Assurance Directorate (IAD), the largest cyber-defense workforce in the government. Its mission has now been combined with the dominant force in the agency, signals intelligence, in a broad operations division. Top NSA officials, including director Mike Rogers, argue that it is better to have offensive and defensive specialists working side by side. Other NSA and White House veterans contend that perfect defense is impossible and therefore more resources should be poured into penetrating enemy networks - both to head off attacks and to determine their origin.  Curtis Dukes, the last head of IAD, said in an interview after retiring last month that he feared defense would get even less attention in a structure where it does not have a leader with a direct line to the NSA director. “It’s incumbent on the NSA to say, ‘This is an important mission’,” Dukes said. “That has not occurred.”   ",3302017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-defense/a-scramble-at-cisco-exposes-uncomfortable-truths-about-u-s-cyber-defense-idUSKBN17013U

745,CSCO,UPDATE 3-Gigamon shares jump as activist investor Elliott takes stake,"(Reuters) - Shares in network software company Gigamon Inc jumped as much as 20 percent on Monday after activist investor Elliott Management reported a 15.3 percent stake and said it would speak to management about undergoing a “strategic review process.” Elliott said in a regulatory filing that Gigamon shares are significantly undervalued and it intends to encourage the company to explore options including a potential sale, according to the filing. (bit.ly/2qhlQ7H) Gigamon makes software installed in large data centers that helps the flow of traffic and prevents bottlenecks. Some of its competitors have been acquired in recent months, such as Ixia, which Keysight Technologies Inc announced in January it would buy for $1.6 billion. Gigamon, based in Santa Clara, California, went public in 2013. Elliott Management, a hedge fund led by Paul Singer, now Gigamon’s top shareholder, said it may also suggest potential changes in the company’s operations and management, among other possible moves. Paul Hooper has been Gigamon’s chief executive since 2012. A smaller hedge fund called Foglamp Capital, said in a statement provided to Reuters that the ""strategic review process that Elliott Management has recommended should unlock significant value."" Foglamp managing partner Wasif Khan said that Gigamon made up 15 percent of its fund. (bit.ly/2pohy9Q) Other test and measurement companies and networking switch companies such as Cisco Systems Inc could be potential buyers for Gigamon, as well as private equity firms, according to Stifel analyst Patrick Newton. Private equity firms targeted Ixia when it was in sales talks, Newton added in a research note. Cisco could not immediately be reached for comment.  Gigamon is latest addition to a long list of enterprise technology companies that Elliott has pushed to explore a sale. Many companies it has targeted such as Mentor Graphics, Lifelock Inc and Qlik Technologies have ended up being acquired by strategic or private equity buyers.  Elliott’s broad range of investments across the tech industry is overseen by portfolio manager Jesse Cohn, who also leads its private equity investing arm, Evergreen. Two weeks ago, Gigamon reported a loss of $2.23 million for the first quarter, compared with profit of $2.97 million a year earlier. Gigamon stock had fallen about 23 percent this year through last Friday. On Monday, shares jumped $6.20, or 17.7 percent, to close at $41.20.

747,CSCO,"US STOCKS-Wall St rises with help from technology, financial, energy stocks","(Reuters) - The S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq notched record closing highs on Monday, powered by demand for technology stocks after a global cyber attack and by rising oil prices. Oil rose to the highest level in more than three weeks after top exporters Saudi Arabia and Russia said supply cuts needed to last into 2018, a step toward extending an OPEC-led deal to support prices for longer than originally agreed. The rising oil prices and housing data drove optimism about the economy and helped make financial stocks .SPSY the second biggest driver for the S&P; 500, behind the technology sector .SPLRCT.  “The oil markets are acting well and that’s helping,” said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York, who also cited the strong corporate earnings season.  About 75 percent of S&P; 500 companies that have reported quarterly results so far have beaten Wall Street expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. While data for New York state’s manufacturing sector was weaker than expected, U.S. homebuilder sentiment gave investors some confidence in the economy. “We need that because there’s been a tug-of-war in this market as to whether this economy is peaking,” Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey, said, referring to the housing sentiment.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 85.33 points, or 0.41 percent, to 20,981.94, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 11.42 points, or 0.48 percent, to 2,402.32 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 28.44 points, or 0.46 percent, to 6,149.67.    Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) were the biggest drivers for the S&P; 500 after prominent analysts upgraded their ratings on the stocks. Shares of cyber security firms jumped on expectations that they would benefit from greater spending after the global “ransomware” attack that began spreading across the globe on Friday. Shares of Fireye (FEYE.O) rose 7.5 percent, and Symantec (SYMC.O) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW.N) both gained around 3 percent. The 2.3 percent rise in Cisco was driven in party by its security technology business. Nine of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors closed higher, with the materials index .SPLRCM leading the percentage gainers. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.04-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P; 500 posted 46 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 144 new highs and 53 new lows.

748,CSCO,"US STOCKS-Wall St hit records as technology, energy stocks rise","* Oil prices hit a more than three-week high * Cisco provides biggest boost to Nasdaq * Indexes up: Dow 0.37 pct, S&P; 0.39 pct, Nasdaq 0.37 pct (Updates to late afternoon, adds commentary, changes bylines) By Sinead Carew May 15 (Reuters) - Wall Street indexes were trading higher on Monday and the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq hit records as a global cyber attack boosted technology stocks and a rise in oil prices lifted energy stocks. Oil hit its highest in more than three weeks after top exporters Saudi Arabia and Russia said supply cuts needed to last into 2018, a step towards extending an OPEC-led deal to support prices for longer than originally agreed. “Stronger energy prices today is certainly affecting the energy sector. Otherwise, earnings continue to be good and that’s giving investors confidence,” said Bryant Evans, investment advisor and portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management, in Champaign, Illinois. About 75 percent of S&P; 500 companies that have reported results so far have beaten Wall Street expectations according to Thomson Reuters data. At 2:46 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 77.88 points, or 0.37 percent, to 20,974.49, the S&P; 500 had gained 9.44 points, or 0.39 percent, to 2,400.34 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 22.90 points, or 0.37 percent, to 6,144.13. Johnson & Johnson and Cisco Systems were the biggest boosts for the S&P; 500 after those stocks were upgraded by prominent analysts. Shares of cyber security firms jumped with Fireye rising 8 percent and Symantec and Palo Alto Networks both gaining 3 percent. The 2.7 percent rise in Cisco shares was also at least partly thanks to its security technology business. Nine of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were higher, with the materials index leading the percentage gainers. Shares of oil majors Exxon and Chevron helped boost the S&P; energy index, which was on track to close higher after two sessions of declines. Some investors however were surprised by the lack of market concern about a successful missile test by North Korea and a cyber attack that disrupted operations at car factories, hospitals, shops and schools. Also the New York Federal Reserve said on Monday its barometer on business activity in New York state unexpectedly fell in May, putting it into negative territory for the first time since October. “(The market) hasn’t been impacted by the cyber attack, no one is getting nervous about North Korea, no one is getting nervous about the lack of reforms in D.C., no one is getting nervous about the horrendous Empire State number this morning. It seems to be completely disconnected from everything,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.95-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.95-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P; 500 posted 44 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 133 new highs and 48 new lows.

749,CSCO,"UPDATE 2-Cisco revenue forecast disappoints; says to cut 1,100 more jobs","(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) forecast current-quarter revenue that widely missed analysts’ estimates and said it would cut 1,100 more jobs, as the world’s largest networking gear maker steps up efforts to transform into a software-focused company. Shares of the Dow component fell 8.2 percent to $31.05 in after-market trading on Wednesday. The stock had closed down 1.4 percent in regular trading, compared with the 1.78 percent slump in the index .DJI. Cisco, which announced in August that it would slash 5,500 jobs, said the new cuts would result in $150 million in additional pretax charges. The company said on Wednesday it expected revenue for its fourth quarter to fall between 4-6 percent from a year earlier, implying a range of $11.88 billion-$12.13 billion.  Analysts on average had expected revenue of $12.51 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Cisco said orders in its public sector business, which includes sales to federal, state and local governments, fell 4 percent in the third quarter ended April 29.  “It’s a pretty significant stall right now with the lack of budget visibility,” Chief Executive Chuck Robbins said on an earnings call. Democrats and Republicans agreed earlier this month to provide around $1 trillion to keep the federal government funded through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.  However, divisions between the parties are likely to flare up again when the White House unveils President Donald Trump’s first full budget for the 2018 fiscal year on Tuesday.  “So, you’ve got some pretty large pieces of (the) business under duress,” Needham & Co analyst Alex Henderson said. “Some of it is probably around the lack of a budget agreement on extending the debt limits until fairly late in the quarter, some of it could be related to timing of programs - it’s hard to pin that down.” Demand for Cisco’s routers remained weak in the latest quarter, contributing to the company’s sixth straight decline in revenue. Revenue in its closely-watched security business, which offers firewall protection and breach detection systems, rose 9 percent to $527 million, but missed analysts’ estimate of $545.5 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet Street Account. The security business is set to benefit from a likely jump in spending by companies and governments following the recent global “ransomware” attack, according to some analysts. Cisco, like other legacy technology players, is shifting its focus to high-growth areas such as security, the Internet of Things and cloud computing, amid intense competition from companies such as Huawei and Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR.N). The company said it expected an adjusted profit of 60 cents-62 cents per share for the current quarter. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 62 cents.  The company’s net income rose to $2.52 billion, or 50 cents per share, in the third quarter ended April 29 from $2.35 billion, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 60 cents per share. Revenue fell 0.5 percent to $11.94 billion.

755,CSCO,Arista wins round in Cisco patent fight over network technology,"(Reuters) - Arista Networks Inc won a ruling on Thursday in its legal battle with Cisco Systems Inc over networking device technology, setting the stage for Arista to undo a U.S. agency’s order blocking importation of some of its products. Arista had asked the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to review the validity of a patent it granted to Cisco relating to network device security. The Patent Office sided with Arista on Thursday, invalidating key claims in the patent. A week earlier, the Patent Office invalidated claims in a different Cisco patent on a way to improve processing in network devices. San Jose, California-based Cisco and Arista are fierce competitors in the multibillion-dollar market for ethernet switches that connect computers and servers. Last month, the U.S. International Trade Commission concluded that Arista’s switches had infringed the Cisco patents and said it would issue an order banning Arista from importing the infringing products into the United States. Arista general counsel Marc Taxay said on Thursday that the company “will now seek complete suspension” of the ITC’s import ban, which is slated to go into effect in July. Cisco did not immediately return a request for comment. Thursday’s ruling is the latest development in a years-long legal battle between Cisco and Arista. Cisco brought multiple lawsuits against Arista in 2014, alleging it has a “culture of copying” Cisco’s intellectual property. Arista has denied the allegations and accused Cisco of a smear campaign. The ITC ruled last year that Arista had infringed three other Cisco patents relating to managing and securing communications networks. Arista redesigned its switches, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in April that the company could resume importing its redesigned products. Shares of Santa Clara, California-based Arista closed at $148.52 on Thursday, up 0.7 percent, after dropping below $145 a share earlier in the day.

760,CSCO,Cisco adds subscription services to its core networking business,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc’s (CSCO.O) core networking business on Tuesday took its first step into the market of subscription services, announcing a suite of new security and automation tools for big businesses. This new “intuitive network” represents a major change in how Cisco generates revenue from its flagship business. The San Jose company has been dependent on the sales of networking equipment that routes traffic on the internet. Moving forward, Cisco hopes its clients will subscribe to the new networking services, creating a recurring stream of monthly revenue. “We have, over the last two years, had an increasing focus on our software and subscription business,” Cisco Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins told Reuters. “For this transition to software and subscription to really become material over time we needed to find a way to bring subscription value to the core networking.” Altogether, the new services are intended to help enterprises run more intelligent networks with automation features and data analytics. Key among the new services is the capability to detect malware, alerting administrators of an intrusion and potentially quarantining affected devices. Robbins emphasized that these services work only when integrated with Cisco’s hardware equipment. The announcements come one day after key tech leaders met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington. The meeting included the likes of Apple Inc (AAPL.O) CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) CEO Satya Nadella and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) CEO Jeff Bezos. Robbins was originally scheduled to attend but pulled out to focus on the product launch. Robbins said he was excited by the Trump administration’s pro-business stances with tax reform in particular.  “We’ve heard a lot over the last 48 hours about their commitment to tax reform, which is incredibly important to Cisco,” Robbins said. “That’s the No. 1 thing that we would like to see accomplished.” ",6202017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cisco-systems-services/cisco-adds-subscription-services-to-its-core-networking-business-idUSKBN19B34E

Sharing a stage with Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins at a Cisco event in Las Vegas, Cook said the combination of gear from the two companies was more secure than the use of competing technology, such as the Android mobile operating system made by Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google. “The thinking we share here is that if your enterprise or company is using Cisco and Apple, the combination of these should make that (cyber-security) insurance cost significantly less,” Cook said. “This is something we’re going to spend some energy on. You should reap that benefit.” Cisco gave few details about the effort, saying in a company blog post the two companies were “collaborating with insurance industry heavyweights ... to offer more robust policies to our customers.” Cisco said it will create systems that allow for continuous security monitoring and for insurers to double-check that the systems are set up as intended. Cisco, a networking company that has increasingly moved into cyber security in recent years, highlighted several other joint efforts with Apple. It rolled out a new security app for iPhones meant to protect against so-called phishing attacks - an email with a malicious link sent under the guise of being legitimate. Cook also said the “fast lane” that Cisco had created in 2015 to speed up Internet connections for iPhones on Cisco routers and switches has been expanded to Mac computers. Long known for its consumer devices, Apple has embraced business users in recent years, adding additional security features to its iPhones and iPads. In 2015, Cook said Apple was generating at least $25 billion a year in revenue selling to businesses.

767,CSCO,Arista loses bid to lift import ban in Cisco battle,"(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Thursday dealt Arista Networks Inc a loss in its technology dispute with Cisco Systems Inc and refused to set aside an order blocking importation of some of Arista’s network switches. The U.S. International Trade Commission refused to rescind its May 4 ruling that found Arista’s switches infringed two Cisco patents and banned Arista from importing the infringing products into the United States.

771,CSCO,Tech companies ramp up NAFTA lobbying on eve of trade talks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Technology companies, such as Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Cisco Systems (CSCO.O)  have ramped up lobbying ahead of talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, looking to avoid any future restrictions on cloud storage and to promote an international pact to eliminate technology goods tariffs.  U.S., Mexican and Canadian negotiators are due to start talks on the 23-year old trade pact on Wednesday. Farming and transportation groups have traditionally dominated lobbying on NAFTA, but technology lobbyists are helping lead the recent surge in efforts to influence Washington, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. Tech companies and trade organizations disclosed they had 48 arrangements with lobby groups that discussed NAFTA with administration officials or lawmakers in the second quarter, up from 17 groups in the first quarter and one group at the end of 2016, according to the data. “It’s both defensive and offensive,” Devi Keller, director of global policy for the Semiconductor Industry Association, said of the industry’s position on the new talks. “There is an opportunity for expansion.” The industry now has almost as many lobby groups representing its views on NAFTA as the transport sector, which includes automakers. That sector had 52 lobbying groups discussing the trade pact with government officials between April and June. Agriculture still dominates the NAFTA lobbying effort with 86 arrangements with lobbying groups. While the auto and farm lobbies are seeking to preserve cross-border supply chains and to retain access to markets in Mexico and Canada, the tech sector wants a revamped NAFTA to help it grow future business. President Donald Trump has blamed NAFTA for the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs and threatened to withdraw from the pact unless it can be reworked in the United States’ favor. Tech firms want a ban on any future government requirements that providers of services, such as cloud computing store data in a particular country. They also seek a commitment by NAFTA members to join a broader international pact to eliminate all tariffs on a broad range of information technology goods, including computers, smartphones, semiconductors and medical devices. Today, the United States and Canada already subscribe to the broader tech agreement but Mexico does not. While tech goods are already face no tariffs under NAFTA and industry representatives said there are no data flow restrictions in the region hampering trade, U.S. firms want an updated NAFTA to help them access other markets by serving as a tech template for future trade pacts.  Tech industry associations have sent letters to the Trump administration asking negotiators to prioritize free flows of data and low tariffs as well as global cybersecurity standards, and have met with staff at the U.S. Trade Representative. “We’re fairly confident the issues we identified will be addressed in the negotiations,” said Ed Brzytwa, director of global policy at the Information Technology Industry Council. It remains unclear, however, how prominently tech concerns will feature at NAFTA talks given Trump’s focus on manufacturing.  The CRP, a nonprofit group that advocates for government transparency, includes media and publishing firms in the technology sector, but the overwhelming majority of the sector’s disclosures on NAFTA came from hardware, software and digital services firms.  The CRP’s database incorporates disclosures to both the Senate and the House of Representatives and includes both in-house lobbyists and external lobbying firms.  Cisco Systems, a networking hardware company, had as many as 10 lobbyists working on NAFTA issues. On a lobby disclosure form reviewed by Reuters, Cisco Systems listed NAFTA and government procurement as the trade issues handled by its lobbyists. Microsoft, which counts cloud computing and software as core businesses, had as many as 13 lobbyists working on NAFTA, according to the CRP database.  The disclosure forms filed by Microsoft do not make clear whether all 13 lobbied on NAFTA, which is listed along with several other trade-related issues and cloud computing.  Amazon, a major cloud services provider and internet retailer, also cited NAFTA as well as “customs procedures” in its lobbying disclosure. The Trump administration has proposed easing customs barriers for online purchases.   Cisco Systems and Amazon declined to comment for this story while Microsoft representatives did not respond to a request for comment.

772,CSCO,"UPDATE 3-Cisco's security business revenue misses estimates, shares drop","(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc’s (CSCO.O) quarterly revenue in its closely-watched security business missed analysts’ estimates, raising concerns about the world’s largest networking gear maker’s efforts to transform into a software-focused company. The company’s shares fell about 2.5 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday. With its traditional business of making switches and routers struggling, Cisco, like other legacy technology firms, has been focusing on high-growth areas such as security, the Internet of Things and cloud computing. The security business, which offers firewall protection and breach detection systems, has been Cisco’s fastest growing, until the last two quarter. Revenue growth at the business slowed to 3 percent in the latest fiscal fourth quarter from 16 percent a year earlier period and 9 percent in the previous quarter. “The business was affected due to orders in Q3 in the UK being slowed due to the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to the pound,” Chief Financial Officer Kelly Kramer told Reuters in an interview.  Chief Executive Chuck Robbins, the architect of Cisco’s transition, said he had “zero concerns” about the security business, while Kramer forecast an uptick in revenue in the upcoming quarter. Analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said the next two quarters would indicate the health of the security business. “I’m not concerned yet with Cisco’s security numbers as many of their security innovations are linked to other businesses like switching,” he said. Cisco’s switches and routers businesses – easily its two biggest – have been struggling due to sluggish demand from telecom carriers and enterprise customers. Revenue in each of the two businesses fell 9 percent in the quarter, missing analysts’ expectations, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet. While security business revenue of $558 million fell short of analysts estimates of $580.5 million, according to FactSet, Cisco’s overall revenue was supported by its data center business and wireless business, which is now its fastest growing. Cisco’s overall revenue fell for the seventh straight quarter, but the near 4 percent decline to $12.13 billion was in line analysts’ estimates of $12.1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 61 cents per share, matching analysts’ estimates. Cisco expects revenue to fall 1 percent to 3 percent in the current fiscal first quarter. That was in line with Wall Street’s expectations, as was Cisco’s adjusted earnings forecast. Up to Wednesday’s close, Cisco’s shares had risen nearly 7 percent this year.

784,CSCO,MessageBird in biggest early-stage funding for European software firm,"AMSTERDAM/LONDON (Reuters) - Dutch start-up messaging company MessageBird has landed $60 million in first-round funding, the largest ever early-stage venture capital investment into a European software company. MessageBird helps 15,000 organizations send messages or communicate with customers via chat, voice or video. Clients range from companies such as Uber, SAP and Heineken, to governments and semi-public organizations that use it for emergency messages and medical appointment notifications. The Amsterdam-based firm competes in the fast-growing cloud-based messaging market with more than a dozen firms, including Twilio, Blackberry, Nexmo and Urban Airship.  The unusually large first round fundraising is due to the company having had almost no outside investment since it was founded in 2011, which forced it to be profitable from the start. It expects to generate revenue of $100 million in 2017. “We have been growing about 100 percent a year for a couple of years now,” Robert Vis, MessageBird’s 33-year-old founder and chief executive, said in an interview. “We are always looking at how to sustain that”. The so-called “Series A” funding round of $60 million was led by Accel Partners of Silicon Valley and joined by Atomico, a top European venture firm, along with seed stage investor Y-Combinator. Messaging software makers face mounting competition including from broad-based cloud services providers such as Microsoft, Cisco, and Amazon, which earlier this year introduced its Connect embedded telephone services at prices one analyst estimated at about 40 percent lower than Twilio’s.  What sets MessageBird apart is that it has forged deals and built interfaces with 220 telecom carriers worldwide, making it the only similar platform running on telecoms carrier-grade infrastructure rather than over the internet. This allows it to speed delivery and guarantee quality of messages at lower costs. “Until MessageBird, no one in the space had successfully built the relationships and technology at scale to directly (connect into) telecommunications carriers around the world,” said Atomico Partner Hiro Tamura, who will join the company’s board. Its services can reach billions of mobile phones, it said. MessageBird said it planned to use the funding to accelerate hiring and target new customers and small acquisitions in the United States, Europe and Asia.  With 75 employees, up from 25 in 2015, MessageBird generates more than $1 million in revenue per employee, “something of a magic number for us,” Vis said. Vis said the funding would also raise its profile and bolster its balance sheet, both of which will reassure high-value potential customers such as banks of its staying power. Despite having many of the business and financial metrics that have led rivals such as Twilio to stock market flotations, Vis said he has no intention to seek an IPO “for years to come.” ",10032017,http://www.reuters.com/article/europe-venturecapital-messagebird/messagebird-in-biggest-early-stage-funding-for-european-software-firm-idUSL8N1MD2DM

788,CSCO,UPDATE 3-Cisco buys BroadSoft for $1.71 bln in software push,"(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) will buy software company BroadSoft Inc BSFT.O for $1.71 billion, it said on Monday, in a deal that boosts Cisco’s collaboration tools and helps the company diversify its offerings away from switching and routing.  Shares in BroadSoft, which specializes in software used by major cable and telecommunications networks, rose 1.35 percent after Cisco offered $55 per share for the company, giving shareholders a premium of 2 percent to last Friday’s closing share price.  The offer price is more than 25 percent higher than where BroadSoft shares were trading before Reuters reported on Aug. 30 that the company was exploring a potential sale. The purchase gives Cisco a stronger foothold in selling products to big telecom firms which can then provide integrated mobile, video, voice and other forms of electronic communications to their small and medium-size business customers.  Rob Salvagno, Cisco’s vice president of corporate development, said in an interview that BroadSoft’s products, which are delivered over the cloud, or the Internet, will improve Cisco’s collaboration portfolio. Cisco’s current products in that unit such as WebEx, are based on premise, which means they are installed on devices.  Cisco shares also rose about 1 percent. “This is a smart acquisition that gives Cisco more firepower to sell into its massive installed base over the coming years,” said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at research firm GBH Insights. The deal, valued at $1.9 billion including debt, is expected to close during the first quarter of 2018, the companies said in a statement.  After the deal, BroadSoft employees will join Cisco’s unified communications technology group. Cisco, like other large technology companies, has been focusing on high-growth areas such as security, the Internet of Things and cloud computing. BroadSoft provides software and services that enable mobile, fixed-line and cable service providers to offer so-called unified communications over their internet protocol networks. BroadSoft has historically sold its products to large telecommunications companies such as Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T; Inc (T.N), which then resell the software to their business customers. Cisco and BroadSoft share a lot of customers, Salvagno added. The BroadSoft deal is Cisco’s second major acquisition this year following a $3.7 billion deal for privately held AppDynamics Inc in March. “With BroadSoft, Cisco will be able to cover a wider swath of the market,” Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White wrote in a note. Jefferies and Qatalyst Partners advised BroadSoft on the deal while Bank of America (BAC.N) advised Cisco.

Third-quarter earnings season is also in focus, with 37 percent of S&P; 500 companies set to report during the week. Corporate earnings have got off to a strong start, with nearly three quarter of the 88 S&P; companies beating profit expectations. “Investors are being cheered on by the global markets after the Japanese election,” said Peter Cardillo, Chief Market Economist at First Standard Financial in New York. “The strength continues based on the prospect of fiscal reform and good earnings.” Wall Street closed at record highs on Friday after the Senate passed a budget resolution, lifting hopes that President Donald Trump’s tax plans may move forward. The top Senate Republican and the White House budget director said on Sunday they hoped for action on the new tax package by the end of the year, while keeping their options open on how to pay for sweeping tax cuts. Investors are also keen to know who will take over from Janet Yellen as the next Federal Reserve chief after her term expires in February. Trump said he would make his choice to lead the Fed soon and was still considering at least three people: Fed Governor Jerome Powell, Stanford University economist John Taylor and Yellen.

Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 10 points, or 0.16 percent, on volume of 26,232 contracts. Hasbro dipped 4.6 percent in premarket trading after the toymaker’s forecast for the holiday season fell below estimates as Toys’R’Us bankruptcy began to hurt its operations. Shares of Mattel fell 2 percent. T-Mobile gained 1.39 percent after the No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier’s profit topped estimates on subscription growth. Telecom software company Broadsoft jumped about 17 percent after Cisco agreed to buy it in a deal valued at about $1.9 billion including debt. Cisco shares were up 0.5 percent.

793,CSCO,CORRECTED-Cisco nears deal to acquire BroadSoft -source,"(Corrects to show share price closed at $53.90, not $54.90, in paragraph 7) By Liana B. Baker SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc , the world’s largest networking gear manufacturer, is nearing a deal to buy U.S. telecommunications software firm BroadSoft Inc for close to $2 billion, a person familiar with the matter said on Sunday. The deal, which comes after Reuters first reported in August that BroadSoft was exploring a sale, would allow Cisco to further diversify away from its stagnating switches and routers business by giving it a stronger foothold in selling unified communications software to big telecommunications firms. If deal negotiations are completed successfully, Cisco’s agreement to buy BroadSoft could be announced as early as Monday, the source said, asking not to be identified because the deal discussions are confidential. Cisco declined to comment. BroadSoft did not immediately return a request for comment. Bloomberg News reported earlier on Sunday that Cisco was close to a deal to acquire BroadSoft. With its traditional business of making switches and routers seeing revenue declines, Cisco, like other legacy technology firms, has been focusing on high-growth areas such as security, the Internet of Things and cloud computing. The BroadSoft deal would be Cisco’s second major acquisition this year following the $3.7 billion acquisition of privately-held AppDynamics Inc in March. BroadSoft shares had closed at $53.90 on Friday, giving the company a market capitalization of $1.67 billion. Based in Gaithersburg, Maryland, BroadSoft provides software and services that enable mobile, fixed-line and cable service providers to offer unified communications over their internet protocol networks. BroadSoft has historically sold its products to large telecommunications companies such as Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T; Inc, which then resell the software to their business customers. BroadSoft has recently tried to revamp its business model to sell directly to these customers, a move that risks its relationships with its telecommunications partners, according to a Barclays Plc research report. New York-based hedge fund P2 Capital Partners LLC owned a 4.6 percent stake in BroadSoft as of the end of June, according to Thomson Reuters data. P2 has often behaved as an activist shareholder and has even offered to buy companies in which it has invested. Another BroadSoft shareholder with a history of acquisitions is buyout firm KKR & Co LP, which is BroadSoft’s 13th-largest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. (Reporting by Liana B.

794,CSCO,Cisco buys BroadSoft for $1.71 billion in software push,"(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) will buy software company BroadSoft Inc BSFT.O for $1.71 billion, it said on Monday, in a deal that boosts Cisco’s collaboration tools and helps the company diversify its offerings away from switching and routing.  Shares in BroadSoft, which specializes in software used by major cable and telecommunications networks, rose 1.35 percent after Cisco offered $55 per share for the company, giving shareholders a premium of 2 percent to last Friday’s closing share price.  The offer price is more than 25 percent higher than where BroadSoft shares were trading before Reuters reported on Aug. 30 that the company was exploring a potential sale. The purchase gives Cisco a stronger foothold in selling products to big telecom firms which can then provide integrated mobile, video, voice and other forms of electronic communications to their small and medium-size business customers.  Rob Salvagno, Cisco’s vice president of corporate development, said in an interview that BroadSoft’s products, which are delivered over the cloud, or the Internet, will improve Cisco’s collaboration portfolio. Cisco’s current products in that unit such as WebEx, are based on premise, which means they are installed on devices.  Cisco shares also rose about 1 percent. “This is a smart acquisition that gives Cisco more firepower to sell into its massive installed base over the coming years,” said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at research firm GBH Insights. The deal, valued at $1.9 billion including debt, is expected to close during the first quarter of 2018, the companies said in a statement.  After the deal, BroadSoft employees will join Cisco’s unified communications technology group. Cisco, like other large technology companies, has been focusing on high-growth areas such as security, the Internet of Things and cloud computing. BroadSoft provides software and services that enable mobile, fixed-line and cable service providers to offer so-called unified communications over their internet protocol networks. BroadSoft has historically sold its products to large telecommunications companies such as Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T; Inc (T.N), which then resell the software to their business customers. Cisco and BroadSoft share a lot of customers, Salvagno added. The BroadSoft deal is Cisco’s second major acquisition this year following a $3.7 billion deal for privately held AppDynamics Inc in March. “With BroadSoft, Cisco will be able to cover a wider swath of the market,” Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White wrote in a note. Jefferies and Qatalyst Partners advised BroadSoft on the deal while Bank of America (BAC.N) advised Cisco.

799,CSCO,Cisco profit beats on strength in security business,"(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, driven by gains from its newer businesses such as security, which more than offset declines in its traditional switches and routers business. This shows the technology leader has begun to turn a corner as it shifts focus from hardware to software and recurring subscriptions, several analysts said. “Cisco has been shifting its business model toward subscriptions, especially in the faster-growing segments like security,” said Tim Green, analyst with the Motley Fool. “That effort may be starting to bear fruit.” The world’s largest network gear maker forecast second-quarter adjusted profit of 58 cents to 60 cents per share, largely above analysts’ estimate of 58 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Cisco forecast a revenue increase of 1 to 3 percent for its second quarter, which would end a streak of eight quarters of year-to-year decline. “The forecast is better than feared and speaks to a company that has started to turn the corner,” said Daniel Ives at research firm GBH Insights.  The company’s shares rose more than 5 percent to $35.95 in after-hours trading. “Cisco has been shifting its business model toward subscriptions, especially in the faster-growing segments like security,” said Tim Green, analyst with the Motley Fool. “That effort may be starting to bear fruit.” Revenue from Cisco’s security business, which offers firewall protection and breach detection systems, rose 8 percent to $585 million. “We’ve been in a multi-year journey selling software and subscriptions against the threat intelligence and the malware intelligence that we have. And I think that’s what’s continuing to pay off,” Chief Executive Charles Robbins said on a post-earnings call. Cisco is focusing on high-growth areas such as security, Internet of Things and cloud computing like other legacy technology companies. “If the new services add revenue next year, they will seem very cheap, and the dividend makes them a great add for a conservative portfolio,” said Phil Davis, CEO of PhilStockWorld.com, an investment advisory service. Recurring revenue from Cisco’s subscription businesses accounted for 32 percent of total revenue in the first quarter, up 3 points year-to-year. The company also reported deferred revenue of $18.6 billion, up 10 percent year-to-year, as a result of Cisco’s new focus on software and services, Green said. Net income rose to $2.39 billion, or 48 cents per share, from $2.32 billion, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 61 cents per share. Revenue fell 1.7 percent to $12.14 billion. Analysts on average had expected Cisco to report a profit of 60 cents per share on revenue of $12.11 billion.

Wal-Mart (WMT.N) surged as much as 11 percent to a record high of $99.68 after reporting its strongest U.S. revenue growth since 2009 and soaring online sales. It ended up 10.9 percent at $99.62. Cisco (CSCO.O) touched $36.67, its highest since February 2001, a day after quarterly profit beat expectations driven by gains from its newer businesses such as security, which more than offset declines in its traditional switches and routers.

Republicans can lose no more than two Senate votes and at least two GOP senators have already spoken against the Senate version of the bill. “The tax plan isn’t a foregone conclusion but it passed the lowest hurdle in the House,” Battle said, adding that the Senate vote will be a higher bar and “the reconciliation will be the real measure, if it happens.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 187.08 points, or 0.8 percent, to 23,458.36, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 21.02 points, or 0.82 percent, to 2,585.64 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 87.08 points, or 1.3 percent, to 6,793.29.

Shares of the world’s largest retailer jumped 4.42 percent in premarket trading after the company reported better-than-expected sales, driven by hurricane-related purchases and soaring online sales. Cisco shares surged 6.36 percent after reporting upbeat results on strength in security business. “One of the most remarkable stories of this year is Wal-Mart and they are again proving that with their results today,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in Boston. The S&P; 500 recorded its biggest percentage decline in more than 2 months on Wednesday as energy stocks dropped on sliding crude prices and concerns over the passage of a tax revamp after two Republican senators were critical of the proposal weighed. The Republican-controlled U.S. Congress was approaching a major test on Thursday of its ability to overhaul the federal tax code, as lawmakers prepared for their first full-scale vote on sweeping tax legislation. Upbeat data on Wednesday added to expectations the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates again next month as well as multiple times next year. At 8:34 a.m. ET (1234 GMT), Dow e-minis were up 68 points, or 0.29 percent, with 29,947 contracts changing hands. S&P; 500 e-minis were up 7.75 points, or 0.3 percent, with 208,483 contracts traded.

810,CSCO,GLOBAL MARKETS-Europe's longest stocks sell-off of the year abates,"* European stocks snap longest losing streak in a year * Dollar gains as investors price in more U.S. rate hikes * Futures tip higher openings for Wall Street * CISCO and Wal-Mart results help mood * Nikkei rallies on bargain-hunting after 6-day losing streak * Peso bounces back from latest NAFTA nose-dive * Graphic: World FX rates in 2017 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Marc Jones LONDON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Investors tentatively returned to world stock markets looking  for bargains on Thursday, after Europe’s longest losing streak of the year and the worst run since March for the top global indices. After five consecutive daily losses on the MSCI index of world stocks and seven straight falls in Europe, there was a bounce of sorts. Benchmark indices in Tokyo, Shanghai and Hong Kong and Seoul all rallied overnight, London, Frankfurt and Paris were up as much as 0.6 percent and futures prices pointed to Wall Street starting percent higher. Cyclical stocks which had driven the recent sell-off made a comeback in both Europe and Asia while upbeat earnings from Wal-Mart and Cisco cheered U.S. traders ahead of the New York open. There was some relief too that oil prices had pulled out of what had been a near 5 percent drop and that upbeat U.S. data on Wednesday had helped the dollar halt the euro’s sharp recent rise. “After five or six days of steady selling you have got people coming back in looking for bargains,” said CMC Markets senior analyst Michael Hewson. “I think it’s temporary though. We haven’t had a significant sell off this year and the fact of the matter is that equity markets have done so much better than anyone dared to envisage.” Bond markets, meanwhile, were seeing a broad rise in yields after the mostly upbeat U.S. data had added to expectations the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates again next month, as well as multiple times next year. Two-year Treasury yields crept to fresh nine-year peaks in European trading, though significantly the U.S. yield curve remained pretty much at its flattest in a decade. European yields nudged higher too but the standout there was a fall in the premium investors demand to hold French debt over German peers to its lowest in 2-1/2 years, and almost to record lows, on optimism about reforms under Emmanuel Macron. With Macron “you have a path towards real reform (in the euro zone),” said the chief investment officer of Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager, Pascal Blanque. “And it’s gaining credibility.” On a more global basis he added however that the firm was in the process of “risk rotation and risk reduction” and that it was expecting a “bumpy” year next year for equity markets. The liveliest moves in Asia had come in Japan, where the Nikkei turned around early losses to surge 1.5 percent as investors returned after a six-day losing streak there. There were 0.6-0.8 percent gains for Shanghai and Hong Kong and Seoul, while Australian stocks added 0.2 percent as data showed the country’s unemployment rate at its lowest since early 2013. Wall Street EMini futures for the S&P; 500 also pointed to a rebound in U.S. markets later. All the major indices had dropped on Wednesday with the energy sector suffering a four-day decline of 4 percent, its weakest such period in 14 months. Investor concern over the progress of a massive U.S. tax reform plan showed no sign of abating as two Republican lawmakers on Wednesday criticised the Senate’s latest proposal. U.S. President Donald Trump hit back, tweeting: “Tax cuts are getting close!” “If we look at what the markets are focusing on, it’s still very much the tax cut debates in the U.S., and how much progress there’s going to be on this front,” said Mitul Kotecha, head of Asia macro strategy for Barclays in Singapore. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was slightly higher on the day at 93.828 having hit four- and five-week lows against the yen and euro. The euro was down around 20 ticks at $1.170, retreating from a one-month top of $1.1860 on Wednesday. Doubts that the latest round of talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement will make much headway in the face of tough U.S. demands remained though Mexico’s peso bounced off an eight-month low it had hit to the previous day. In commodity markets, gold edged down 0.1 percent to $1,278.26 an ounce. It reached $1,289.09 overnight, its highest since Oct. 20. Oil prices also began to wilt again after the U.S. government reported an unexpected increase in crude and gasoline stockpiles. They had also lost ground this week on the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) outlook for slower growth in global crude demand. U.S. crude slipped 18 cents to $55.16 a barrel. Brent crude futures were 34 cents lower at $61.53. ",11162017,http://www.reuters.com/article/global-markets/global-markets-europes-longest-stocks-sell-off-of-the-year-abates-idUSL8N1NM4NU
811,CSCO,"Wall Street rallies powered by Cisco, Walmart; House tax vote supports","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street’s main indexes rose sharply on Thursday boosted by earnings-related gains in Wal-Mart and Cisco, while a tax bill expected to boost corporate earnings passed its first, if smallest, hurdle. Wal-Mart (WMT.N) surged as much as 11 percent to a record high of $99.68 after reporting its strongest U.S. revenue growth since 2009 and soaring online sales. It ended up 10.9 percent at $99.62. Cisco (CSCO.O) touched $36.67, its highest since February 2001, a day after quarterly profit beat expectations driven by gains from its newer businesses such as security, which more than offset declines in its traditional switches and routers. Its profit forecast also came in above estimates. Cisco shares closed up 5.2 percent at $35.88. “There was good news on old line companies Cisco and Walmart adapting to the new economy,” said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago, citing reasons for the market’s advance. The U.S. House of Representatives voted largely along party lines to pass a tax overhaul expected to be a boost to stock prices if it becomes law, but the legislative battle now shifts to the Senate, where the Republican majority is much slimmer. Republicans can lose no more than two Senate votes and at least two GOP senators have already spoken against the Senate version of the bill. “The tax plan isn’t a foregone conclusion but it passed the lowest hurdle in the House,” Battle said, adding that the Senate vote will be a higher bar and “the reconciliation will be the real measure, if it happens.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 187.08 points, or 0.8 percent, to 23,458.36, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 21.02 points, or 0.82 percent, to 2,585.64 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 87.08 points, or 1.3 percent, to 6,793.29. The S&P; and the Dow posted their largest daily percentage gains in more than two months. The CBOE Volatility index .VIX, the cost of protection against a sudden drop on the S&P; 500, posted its first decline in six days. It dropped 1.4 points to end at 11.76. Barnes & Noble (BKS.N) shares jumped 7.6 percent to $7.10 even after the book seller said a deal proposed by an activist investor to take it private was not “bona fide” and doubted the required funds could be raised. Folgers coffee maker J M Smucker (SJM.N) rose 9.5 percent to $116.65 as its sales and profit topped analysts’ forecasts. Viacom (VIAB.O) shares fell 3.7 percent to end at $23.69 after the MTV owner said it expected high single-digit declines in revenue from U.S. cable TV operators and online distributors in the first half of 2018. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.26-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P; 500 posted 42 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 115 new highs and 36 new lows. About 6.31 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.81 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. It was among the weakest volume sessions in the past three weeks.

IOTA clarified that the error was due to the fact that it co-founded the Trusted IoT Alliance with Cisco.) IOTA, an open-source blockchain network, has teamed up with some of the biggest global corporate names led by Microsoft, Volkswagen and Samsung Group to launch what is aimed to be a secure marketplace for data, IOTA co-founder David Sønstebø said on Tuesday. Blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions that underpinned the first crypto-currency bitcoin. It has gained worldwide prominence due to its perceived usefulness in recording and keeping track of assets across all industries. “The data marketplace is a completely separate project that simply utilizes the underlying IOTA protocol,” said Sønstebø in emailed responses to Reuters. IOTA is headquartered in Berlin. The project aims to create a market for data that companies can buy and sell. IOTA said more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are generated daily and are increasing exponentially on a monthly basis. However, more than 99 percent of this data is wasted and lost to the void because there is currently no ability for owners to sell or share this data in a secure fashion. “Any kind of data can be monetized,” Sønstebø said. “If you have a weather station collecting wind, temperature, humidity, and barometric data, for instance, you can sell that to an entity that is doing climatic research.” As soon as data is put onto IOTA’s decentralized ledger, it is distributed to countless nodes or the computers that connect to the blockchain network, ensuring that it is impossible to tamper with the data, Sønstebø said. Each of IOTA’s partners on the marketplace project will provide data within their sector. “The goal is to enable a very diverse and open data marketplace...which incentivizes a free flow of data between entities,” Sønstebø said. The IOTA network has been live since 2016, the IOTA co-founder said, in an earlier interview with Reuters. It did a crowdfunding event in 2015, so that people could support the project, raising more than 1,300 bitcoins, he said. “IOTA is kind of the first distributed ledger that goes beyond the blockchain,” Sønstebø said.  “We got rid of the blocks and we got rid of the chains, which has resulted in getting rid of the major pain points or limitations of the blockchain such as fees, scalability, and centralization.” ",12072017,http://www.reuters.com/article/blockchain-iota/corrected-blockchain-network-iota-teams-up-with-microsoft-others-on-data-marketplace-idUSL1N1NX1T7

819,CSCO,U.S. tax overhaul may drain $2 trillion from foreign projects -UN,"GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax reform could bring almost $2 trillion back to the United States as U.S. firms repatriate cash piles from foreign affiliates, a U.N. report said on Monday. Ending the incentive to hoard cash overseas could produce a stimulus effect in the United States, and Trump has credited the tax reform with spurring a $350 billion investment plan by Apple. (AAPL.O) “Now is the perfect time to bring your business, your jobs, and your investments to the United States of America,” Trump told the World Economic Forum in Davos last month.   The reform ends a system whereby companies defer tax on foreign earnings until the funds are repatriated. Instead it treats those earnings as if they were being repatriated, with an 8 percent tax on non-cash assets and a 15.5 percent tax on cash. “This measure is widely expected to have the most significant and immediate effect on global investment patterns,” said the report by the U.N. trade and development agency UNCTAD. Big firms had long awaited such a tax break, having last received one in the 2005 U.S. Homeland Investment Act, which brought $300 billion back from abroad, the report said. Since then, U.S. overseas retained earnings have grown to $3.2 trillion, half of U.S.-owned foreign direct investment, with about $2 trillion in cash. Unlike in 2005, companies are not required to actually repatriate the funds.  The biggest overseas cash hoarders are in the tech sector, with Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, Alphabet and Oracle holding $530 billion, a quarter of the total, the report said. Other major cash holders are in pharmaceuticals and engineering. Almost 40 percent of the funds are located in the United Kingdom or its Caribbean offshore territories such as the British Virgin Islands, UNCTAD said, citing data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  Even if the money was not invested in tangible assets, its withdrawal could still have a macroeconomic impact, said Richard Bolwijn, UNCTAD’s head of investment research. “It’s still a part of... the external sources of finance helping to make up for savings shortfalls in developing countries,” he said.   Much of the impact depends on how other countries react, and there is still uncertainty as the details of the tax bill are clarified, and some concerns that the U.S. reforms could violate tax treaties and trade rules, the UNCTAD report said.

820,CSCO,"Apple, Cisco team up with insurance companies to offer cyber policy discounts","(Reuters) - Apple Inc and Cisco Systems Inc have teamed up with insurer Allianz SE to offer discounts on cyber insurance to businesses that primarily use equipment from both technology companies, they said on Monday. The arrangement, which also includes insurance broker Aon Plc, will help businesses fortify their cyber security defenses and make them eligible to score more favorable terms for cyber coverage, such as lower or no deductibles, along with support services in the event of attack, the companies said. “The key here is a holistic approach to cyber,” Jason Hogg, chief executive officer of Aon Cyber Solutions, which helped develop the product, said in an interview.  The offering helps to streamline cyber security for businesses, which Hogg said are often addressed in a “siloed manner,” with everyone from technology staff to legal departments playing separate roles. Cyber coverage is a mounting concern for companies worldwide as hackers increasingly take aim at their technology systems. Cyber crime insurance, once a little-known product, has gained traction as hacks involving large companies such as Equifax Inc and Target Corp have become more costly and commonplace. U.S. cyber security premiums totaled $1.35 billion in 2016, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. That is a sliver of the $244.9 billion in total premiums for U.S. commercial line insurers, but a growing market in which insurers are trying to distinguish themselves. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in June that his company and Cisco were collaborating to get cyber insurance discounts for businesses using their products. He said the combination of gear from the two companies was more secure than competing technology.  Long known for its consumer devices, Apple has embraced business users in recent years, adding additional security features to its iPhones and iPads. In 2015, Cook said Apple was generating at least $25 billion a year in sales to businesses. The new offering begins with a cyber security evaluation by Aon, the companies said. Businesses using Cisco Ransomware Defense malware-blocking software and certain Apple devices can then apply for special cyber insurance through the specialty lines unit of Allianz SE, the companies said. Policyholders that are victims of a cyber attack will receive support services from either Cisco or Aon, the companies said.

822,CSCO,Cisco tops estimates as turnaround takes center stage,"(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc reported its first rise in quarterly revenue in more than two years and forecast upbeat current-quarter profit, as the network gear maker’s years-long efforts to transform into a software-focused company begins to pay off. Shares of the Dow component, which also benefited from growth in its switching business, jumped 7.1 percent to $45.09 in after-market trading on Wednesday. Cisco raised its buyback program by $25 billion, taking the total to about $31 billion.  The company said it plans to bring back $67 billion of funds held overseas in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 by taking advantage of the recent changes to the U.S. tax laws. However, the new tax laws led to an $11.1 billion charge, pushing the company to post a loss for the second quarter.  Faced with sluggish demand for its traditional switches and routers business from telecom carriers, Cisco has been moving to a software- and subscription-focused model. “We are clearly seeing the results of the strategy we’ve articulated over the last 10 quarters,” Chief Executive Chuck Robbins said on a post-earnings call. Revenue from its infrastructure platforms category, which includes switching, routing and data center businesses, rose 2 percent to $6.7 billion. The company is also betting on subscription services for a recurring stream of revenue. “I’m most impressed at the growth in software subscriptions as Cisco five years ago was primarily about hardware,” said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. Cisco has also doubled down on M&As; to build up its software business. Since Robbins took charge in July 2015, the company has acquired Internet-of-Things firm Jasper Technologies, software makers Broadsoft and AppDynamics Inc, among others. The Broadsoft acquisition, which closed earlier this month, helped boost Cisco’s third-quarter adjusted profit. The company forecast adjusted profit between 64 cents and 66 cents per share, above analysts’ estimate of 63 cents. Cisco posted a net loss of $8.8 billion, or $1.78 per share, in the second quarter ended Jan. 27, compared with a profit of $2.3 billion, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 63 cents per share. Revenue rose 2.7 percent to $11.9 billion.

827,CSCO,"U.S. stock volatility shock wanes, VIX futures signal smoother sailing","NEW YORK, Feb 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks may have recovered only about half the ground lost in the recent selloff, but traders in the derivatives market are fast dialing down their fears of more ructions. The CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term volatility in the S&P; 500 , while not quite back to where it was before last week’s slump in equities, has retreated sharply from the high of 50.3 hit on Feb. 5. The index was last up 0.34 points at 19.6 on Thursday. “Fear has come down dramatically but certainly not the level of complacency seen pre-correction,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. The VIX futures curve, a snapshot of prices of futures contracts on the volatility index across different expirations, also painted a less fearful picture. The curve moved into backwardation over the last two weeks, meaning investors were paying more for near-term insurance than for contracts that would protect them farther out in time. That rare situation highlighted the extreme level of fear of further near-term losses for U.S. stocks. On Wednesday the backwardation had reached its most extreme level since Aug. 11, 2011, when rating agency Standard & Poor’s downgraded the United States’ credit rating. With Wednesday’s expiry of February VIX futures, the curve was approaching its more typical contango, where investors pay more for farther out contracts than for near-term contracts. “Any time the front-month contracts expire, you immediately see a big adjustment in the curve,” said Frederick. VIX futures imply investors expect the VIX to remain in the 15 to 18 range over the next few months, he said. U.S. stocks were little changed on Thursday, after four straight days of gains for the S&P; 500. Blue-chips Apple Inc and Cisco Systems rose as investors shrugged off fears of rising inflation and hunted for bargains.

Oil prices fell more than 1 percent as worries of rising U.S. production outweighed a weak dollar. The S&P; 500 energy index was down nearly 2 percent. At 11:33 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 percent at 24,943.93 and the S&P; 500 rose 0.21 percent to 2,704.22. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 percent to 7,179.58, helped by gains for Apple and Cisco. Apple rose 1.6 percent after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway made the iPhone maker its top investment. Cisco gained 3.3 percent on upbeat results and forecast. Wall Street shrugged off fears of rising inflation and higher interest rates to open more than half a percent higher on Thursday, putting the markets on course for their fifth straight day of gains. Data showed U.S. producer prices rose 0.4 percent in January, but only matched economists’ estimates and likely helped further ease fears of inflation uptick. “We’re continuing to see a bounce back, a recovery from the recent pullback. Everyone sold in the anticipation of the world ending and when it does not end, all of a sudden people decide to move back in,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer of Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Massachusetts. “We’ve shaken out a lot of people who are worried. Many of the sellers have already sold and consequently there are lot of more buyers and fewer sellers in the market.” Seven of the 11 major S&P; sectors were up, led by gains in technology and industrials. The S&P; 500 has now surged about 5 percent since last Thursday, but is still 5.5 percent below its record high on Jan. 26. U.S. Treasury yields slipped on Thursday after sizable gains in recent sessions, as investors took a breather from selling bonds. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields fell to 2.8876 after hitting a more than four-year peak of 2.944 percent. The CBOE Volatility index, also known as Wall Street’s ‘fear gauge’, rose to a session high of 19.85 points, but was well off the 50-point peak it touched last week. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,398 to 1,381. On the Nasdaq, 1,460 issues rose and 1,306 fell.

Cisco shares jumped nearly 5 percent after the network gear maker posted upbeat results and forecast, while Apple rose 1.2 percent after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway made the iPhone maker its top investment. The duo, along with strong gains in industrials, pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.75 percent to 25,079.59. The S&P; 500 gained 0.51 percent to trade at 2,712.32 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.47 percent to 7,177.39. “A lot of investors are looking for opportunities or pull backs to put money to work, there’s still a lot of cash out there looking for something to do,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. “I think we’re back to ‘buy the dips’ mentality here.” A Labor Department report showed U.S. producer prices rose 0.4 percent in January, but only matched economists’ estimates and likely helped further ease fears that inflation was picking up faster than expected. That comes a day after strong January consumer prices data raised fears of inflation and faster interest rate hikes. A report showed an unexpected fall in retails sales last month. But after a dip, the market closed higher Wednesday. “ ... The ability of the markets to spit out bad news in terms of the higher inflation, weaker sales is a pretty strong sign,” Brown said. The S&P; 500 has now surged about 5 percent since last Thursday, but is still 5.5 percent below its record high on Jan. 26. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields hit a new four-year high of 2.9040 percent on strengthening expectations of a rate hike in March. But while yields have been on the uptick since the CPI data, they have not come at the cost of stocks. A further boost to markets came from a continued fall in a key measure of near-term volatility. The CBOE Volatility index was at about 18-point mark on Thursday, well off the 50-point peak touched last week. Also underpinning many investors’ confidence is the view that the U.S. economy remains on strong footing as well as the expected boost of tax cuts on corporate profits. Among the 11 major S&P; sectors, the energy index and the telecoms index were in the red, falling 0.54 percent and 0.25 percent, respectively. TripAdvisor gained about 14 percent after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,856 to 716. On the Nasdaq, 1,541 issues rose and 799 fell.

830,CSCO,Cisco shares scale 18-year highs on return of revenue growth,"(Reuters) - Shares in Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) were set to open at their highest in 18 years on Thursday after quarterly earnings suggested a years-long effort to turn the network gear maker around was finally bearing fruit. Shares of the world’s biggest producer of vital data connectors like routers and switches were up 7.7 percent at $45.53 in premarket trading. They have risen 30 percent in the past 12 months. At least 12 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, with the highest now Deutsche Bank analysts’ $55 a share. The company’s quarterly revenue rose 2.7 percent to $11.9 billion, the first rise in more than two years. It also forecast an upbeat current quarter. “Cisco’s print and the guidance are important milestones – they may change investor perceptions about the company as a ‘melting ice cube’,” Jefferies analyst George Notter said. Cisco has been trying to reimagine itself as a software company with a focus on subscriptions after struggling with waning demand in its traditional business of selling the routers and switches which direct Internet traffic.  “(A) return to growth (is) no longer on the horizon; it has arrived - fueled by broad-based improvement across product, customer and regional markets and in both macro and company-specific execution,” Cowen and Co analyst Paul Silverstein said.    The company has benefited from the growth in smartphones, tablets and Internet of Things gadgets, the shift into cloud services that demand more connections between servers, and the rise of security threats. Cisco started its transition toward a subscription and software-focused model nearly three years ago when long-time company executive Chuck Robbins took over as CEO. It now gets a third of its revenue from recurring offers and more than half of software revenue from subscriptions. Out of 29 analysts covering the stock, 20 have a “buy” or higher rating and nine have a “hold.” No one rates the stock a “sell.”       “We have consistently argued that Cisco is a ‘rerating’ story with an accelerating mix shift to stickier and higher margin software and subscriptions portfolio,” Deutsche Bank analyst Vijay Bhagavath said. At Wednesday’s close, Cisco’s market value was $208.08 billion, still just a third of the $619 billion it was worth at the peak of the dotcom boom in 2000.

834,CSCO,Smartsheet hires banks to prepare for IPO -sources,"(Reuters) - Smartsheet Inc, a U.S. vendor of software used by corporate employees to collaborate on projects, has hired investment banks for an initial public offering (IPO) that could value it at about $1 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. Smartsheet is one of several startups looking to take market share from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) in workplace productivity tools. Others, such as Slack and Atlassian Corp Plc (TEAM.O), as well as major technology companies, including Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), and Facebook Inc (FB.O) have been releasing similar products. Smartsheet has hired investment banks Morgan Stanley (MS.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Jefferies LLC as IPO underwriters, the sources said. Smartsheet has also registered its IPO confidentially with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the sources added. The company could make this registration public as early as Monday as it gears up for its IPO, which could come in the next three months, according to the sources. Like many technology companies tapping the stock market, Smartsheet is not yet profitable, one of the sources said. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Smartsheet, JPMorgan and Jefferies declined to comment, while Morgan Stanley did not respond to a request for comment. Smartsheet’s IPO preparations come as stock market investors show growing appetite for companies in the enterprise technology sector. Atlassian’s shares have risen 164 percent since the company’s $465 million IPO in December 2015. Dropbox Inc (DBX.O), another U.S. software company that sells its tools to large companies, saw its shares trade up 35 percent at its stock market debut on Friday, the biggest IPO in the technology sector in more than a year. Founded in 2005, Smartsheet is based in Bellevue, Washington and counts Cisco and Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) among its customers. Cisco uses Smartsheet to help manage and track its projects’ budgets and timelines, according to Smartsheet’s website. Smartsheet has raised more than $120 million from investors that include Insight Venture Partners, Summit Partners, Madrona Venture Group and Sutter Hill Ventures. It said last year that it would exceed $100 million in annual recurring revenue by the end of 2017, and that its revenue had increased by more than 60 percent year-over-year for the past five years.  Smartsheet’s latest private fundraising round was in May 2017, when it said it had amassed $52.1 million from investors.

842,CSCO,Permira to buy back Cisco's pay-TV software business,"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Private equity firm Permira [PERM.UL] said on Tuesday it is buying back Cisco System’s (CSCO.O) video software unit, six years after it sold the business to Cisco for $5 billion. Permira said a subsidiary had agreed to buy the UK-based unit, which it will turn into a new, rebranded company focused on developing video software for the pay-TV industry. It named video industry veteran Abe Peled as chairman of the business. A source familiar with the deal said Permira was paying $1 billion for the unit, confirming a report in Israeli news website Calcalist. Peled declined to comment on the price tag. Peled, who has been advising Permira for the past six years, was CEO of the business, then called NDS, when it was sold by Permira and News Corp to Cisco in 2012. The company’s customers include Sky TV in the UK, AT&T;’s DirecTV, Vodafone in Germany and China’s state satellite TV. However, it is operating in a highly competitive environment as companies like Netflix, Hulu, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc’s prime video have all been investing heavily to strengthen content. NDS, established in 1988 in Israel, is now based in the UK and has about 3,500 employees, including about 700 at its research and development center in Israel. Peled told Reuters by phone that the business is profitable but would not disclose details. The transaction fits in well with Permira’s strategy, he said, noting the private equity firm has multiple investments in pay-TV and technology. “They see opportunity for creating value through innovation and growth,” Peled said. Streaming piracy is another problem for the industry and Peled noted that Israel’s expertise in cybersecurity could help the company further develop solutions. Peled said more than 50 percent of major pay-TV operators in the world are customers of the video software unit, with its software installed in over 300 million end-user devices. Cisco senior vice president Yvette Kanouff said in a blog that Cisco’s strategy is focused on areas such as networking, cloud, security and data. Peled could not say what exit strategy Permira will choose for the business. “You focus on the company doing well and creating value and when the time comes the exit strategy will present itself, whether it’s an IPO or another private equity firm or a strategic acquisition,” he said.
