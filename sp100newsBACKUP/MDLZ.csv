4,MDLZ,"Kraft, Mondelez stand by 2013 forecasts","(Reuters) - Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O and Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) both stood by their full-year 2013 forecasts on Wednesday in their first earnings reports as standalone companies following last month’s breakup. Kraft, home to brands like Oscar Mayer lunch meat and Maxwell House coffee, said it was working to better tailor its product portfolio to a weak economy in North America, the only region in which it now operates. Mondelez, a geographically diverse snack company with brands like Cadbury chocolate and Trident gum, said it had “short-term executional” issues in Brazil and Russia that hurt sales in the quarter. After taking steps to address them, Mondelez said it expects them to be resolved by the end of the year. Mondelez derives some 45 percent of sales from developing markets, and saw a 6.6 percent hit from foreign exchange rates. Kraft is focused on slower-growing North America, and sees earnings growth limited by the spending power of U.S. consumers who face stubbornly high unemployment and slow economic growth. In the weakened economy, Kraft said it must drive sales volume with more advertising and a greater range of products and prices, in what it calls a “good, better, best” strategy. “You have to be able to offer price points and innovation in all segments,” said Kraft Chief Executive Tony Vernon on a conference call. He said specific areas needing improvement were Maxwell House coffee, Planters nuts and Jell-O. “The economic environment has not improved and that creates a burning platform for Kraft, our customers and our industry,” Vernon said. Shares of Mondelez were down 1 percent at $26 in after-hours trade. Shares of Kraft, which reported results on Wednesday morning, closed down 0.3 percent at $44.57 on the Nasdaq. After adjustments related to the separation, Mondelez reported third-quarter earnings of 37 cents per share and revenue of $8.3 billion, which was down 5 percent and slightly short of analysts’ estimate of $8.66 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “As we expected, our top-line growth this quarter was modest,” said Irene Rosenfeld, Mondelez’s chief executive. Excluding the impact of currency exchange rates, revenue would have risen 1.5 percent. Kraft said net income rose to $470 million, or 79 cents per share, from $417 million, or 70 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 3 percent to $4.61 billion. Most of the increase came from volume gains and selling a more expensive mix of products, with a smaller contribution from price increases. The company affirmed its 2013 outlook, calling for earnings of $2.60 per share and revenue growth in line with the rest of the North American food and beverage market. Mondelez also stood by its forecast, which calls for earnings of $1.50 to $1.55 per share and revenue growth at the low end of a 5 to 7 percent range. Kraft said revenue in the current, fourth quarter would be flat to down due to a comparison with the year-earlier period when retailers increased orders in advance of a price increase.

After taking steps to address them, Mondelez said it expects the issues to be resolved by the end of the year. “Our revenue growth hit a bit of a speed bump in the third quarter,” said Mondelez Chief Financial Officer Dave Brearton. “But we fully expect it to rebound in (the fourth quarter) to mid-single-digit (growth).” Mondelez said that in Brazil gum category sales slowed to about half their prior rate, but the company failed to slow its shipments in time, leading to retailers getting overstocked and reducing future orders. The company then pulled back on its marketing for biscuits, which ended up hurting sales in that category as well. “Essentially, they robbed Peter to pay Paul,” said Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld. “I would suggest that was a mistake, in hindsight, and we have since restored marketing support to previous levels.” In Russia, the company did not lower prices on coffee and chocolate as fast as some competitors did after raising them to offset higher commodity costs.

10,MDLZ,UPDATE 1-India investigating Cadbury local unit in tax case,"* India beefing up tax enforcement to bolster coffers * Junior minister says case involves about 2 bln rupees * Second case to involve Cadbury arising from Kraft deal By Rajesh Kumar Singh NEW DELHI, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Authorities in India are investigating the local unit of chocolate maker Cadbury over allegations the company may have evaded as much as 2 billion rupees ($36.29 million) in taxes, a junior finance minister said on Thursday, as the country beefs up its efforts to increase revenues to contain a widening fiscal deficit. “Two cases of tax evasion by Cadbury India Ltd have been detected by the Directorate General of Central Excise Intelligence during the years 2009-10 to 2012-13, up to 31st October, 2012,” the minister, S.S. Palanimanickam, told parliament in a written reply to questions from lawmakers. This is the second time in as many years Cadbury has run into trouble with Indian authorities. Last year, an investigation was launched to determine whether Kraft Foods Inc  needed to pay taxes arising from its $19 billion takeover of Cadbury. That probe is ongoing. The latest of the two cases against Cadbury’s India unit, which is controlled by Mondelez International Inc, involves alleged evasion of central excise duty, or factory gate tax at a company facility in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh. The Economic Times newspaper carried a Press Trust of India report earlier this month that Cadbury had “wrongfully” claimed an area-based tax exemption for its unit in Himachal Pradesh. That report said the amount involved about 1 billion rupees. A spokesman for Cadbury India said the company was “fully cooperating” with authorities. “Since the investigation currently is underway, it will be inappropriate on our part to discuss the details at this time,” the spokesman said in an emailed statement. Tax officials were not immediately available for comment. Kraft Foods Inc last month spun off its North American grocery business as Kraft Foods Group.

17,MDLZ,UPDATE 3-Oreo maker Mondelez results weaker-than-expected; shares fall,"By Martinne Geller Feb 13 (Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc  reported weaker-than-expected revenue for the second time in its two quarters as an independent company, and its shares fell 3.7 percent in afterhours trade. The company, which makes Trident gum, Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate, saw revenue rise 3.7 percent excluding any impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other things. That is slightly weaker than its forecast calling for mid-single-digit growth, which the company said would have been at least 4 percent. Mondelez stood by its forecast for 2013 revenue growth at the low end of the 5 percent to 7 percent range, but at least one Wall Street analyst questioned whether Mondelez can achieve it. “The organic growth has now fallen short of street expectations for two consecutive quarters,” said JP Morgan analyst Ken Goldman on a conference call, noting that growth potential is the main reason for investing in Mondelez stock. “Right now, there is a little lack of confidence that (Mondelez) will get to that 5 percent number, right or wrong,” Goldman told company executives. Late last year, Kraft Foods Group spun off from its parent company, taking away brands like Maxwell House, Kraft and Oscar Mayer from the snacks business, renamed Mondelez. While the new Kraft is a high-margin, North American business with mature brands, Mondelez was seen as more of a growth company, given its large exposure to emerging markets and snacks. For the fourth quarter, Mondelez cited a sales interruption in Canada related to the separation of its businesses and ongoing weakness in the gum segment. In the third quarter, the company blamed “short-term executional” issues in Brazil and Russia, that it said have since improved. The gum business has struggled for some time, due to market share losses and weakness in the overall category as young people, key buyers of gum, have been hit hard by unemployment. “Frankly, I’m disappointed that gum remains a challenge,” Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld said on the conference call. “At only 9 percent of our total revenue, we do not need an immediate turnaround in gum to achieve our 2013 revenue guidance or our long-term targets.” She said the company is working on improving its market share. Fixing the category will take more time, she said. Aside from those things, Rosenfeld told Reuters she felt very good about the results, saying that performance in developing markets had rebounded as predicted. “Overall, it was a sound quarter,” Rosenfeld said, adding that she remains as convinced of the benefits of splitting up the company, if not more so, than she was last year. The company raised its forecast for 2013 operating earnings to a range of $1.52 to $1.57 per share, due to currency. It earlier forecast $1.50 to $1.55 per share. Revenue growth will be more modest in the first half of the year and accelerate in the back half, the company said. Net profit for the fourth quarter was $534 million, or 30 cents per share, down from $830 million, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings were 36 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 38 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 1.9 percent to $9.50 billion. Analysts expected $9.69 billion. “We had thought Mondelez had the potential to disappoint on the top line, related to the turnaround efforts in the gum segment and the fact that tastes in snack preferences vary around the world,” said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. “We hadn’t been as aggressive as the market.” Lash said she believes the fair value of Mondelez shares is around $24. The shares closed at $27.75 on Wednesday on the Nasdaq, up 9 percent this year. They fell to $26.76 in afterhours trading.",2142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/mondelez-results/update-3-oreo-maker-mondelez-results-weaker-than-expected-shares-fall-idUSL1N0BDI3X20130214
18,MDLZ,Kraft Foods revenue hurt by Oscar Mayer share loss,"(Reuters) - Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O said on Friday it expects to report a 10.7 percent decline in fourth-quarter revenue, saying it failed to adequately tailor some products, particularly its Oscar Mayer lunch meat, to meet consumer demand for lower-priced foods. The news from Kraft comes on the heels of disappointing results from Mondelez International (MDLZ.O), which used to be combined with Kraft before the companies split late last year. “We definitely stubbed our toe this quarter,” Chief Executive Tony Vernon told analysts on a conference call. He said sales were hurt after rivals launched lower-priced items that Kraft did not match. As an example, Vernon cited the differing performances of its Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and its Oscar Mayer lunch meat. After a “formidable entry from a significant industry player” in the packaged macaroni and cheese business, Kraft stepped up with bonus packages, promotions, new products and increased advertising. It saw macaroni and cheese sales grow 11 percent. On the other hand, Vernon said, the company’s Oscar Mayer lunch meat brand stood by and watched as it experienced a “major share loss in the fourth quarter” to a new value-priced offering from a competitor. “In hindsight I regret not responding on cold cuts exactly the way we responded on mac & cheese,” Vernon said. Kraft said it now expects full-year 2013 earnings of about $2.75 per share, up from a previous forecast of $2.60 per share. The company expects fourth-quarter earnings of about 15 cents per share, including a one-time, non-cash charge of about 24 cents for post-employment benefits, 14 cents of restructuring charges, and a charge of 4 cents related to hedging activities. The company plans to issue final 2012 results by March 29. Shares were up 0.3 percent in morning trading.

20,MDLZ,Cadbury used nonexistent factory to avoid India taxes: WSJ,"(Reuters) - Cadbury Plc, now part of Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), used a nonexistent factory in India to avoid about $46 million in taxes, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing a report by the Indian tax authorities. Cadbury's Indian unit manipulated invoices and other documents to get an exemption from taxes available to companies that began production in new plants in the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh by March 31, 2010, the Journal said.

23,MDLZ,"Mondelez, PepsiCo shares up after report of Peltz stake","(Reuters) - Shares in top U.S. packaged food companies Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) and PepsiCo Inc PEP.N jumped on Friday on speculation that they could merge, after a report that activist investor Nelson Peltz has taken stakes in each. Citing sources familiar with the matter, Britain’s Daily Telegraph reported that Peltz had spent $2 billion on shares of the companies through his investment vehicle, Trian Fund Management. The paper speculated that Peltz could then push for a merger of the two companies. The often speculated-upon marriage between PepsiCo and Mondelez would bring together salty snacks like Doritos and Tostitos with sweets like Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies. The resulting behemoth would have more than $100 billion in revenue and $20 billion of operating earnings per year. A deal would also reunite Mondelez Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld with Frito-Lay, which she ran for two years before taking the reins at Kraft in 2006. A spokeswoman for Trian declined to comment on the report. Spokesmen for PepsiCo and Mondelez declined to comment on “rumor or speculation” regarding any Trian stake, though both indicated the companies were happy with where they were now. “We’re satisfied with the portfolio where it stands today,” said a Mondelez spokesman. “We are making strong progress in our strategy to deliver long-term growth and create shareholder value,” said a PepsiCo spokesman. “We do not see the need for any large scale M&A.;” Mondelez shares rose $1.17, or 4 percent, to $29.73 on the Nasdaq, while PepsiCo shares rose $2.49, or 3.3 percent, to $78.64 on the New York Stock Exchange. Through Thursday’s close, PepsiCo shares have increased 11 percent this year, following a transition year in 2012 that saw it reinvest heavily in its brands. The company is under less pressure than it was a year ago when shares were stagnant, but at least one shareholder welcomed the news. “Anything that creates some urgency among PepsiCo’s top management to maximize per share value is a very good thing,” said Robert Sanborn, whose Chicago-based hedge fund Sanborn Kilcollin Partners owned roughly 220,000 PepsiCo shares at the end of 2012. Nelson Peltz is no stranger to the food industry, or to PepsiCo and Mondelez in particular. “Mr. Peltz’s influence, for example, was a major reason for the spinoff of Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS.N) from Cadbury, Kraft’s purchase of Cadbury and Kraft’s breakup into Kraft Foods Group KRFT.O and Mondelez,” said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Christopher Growe. Peltz is also a shareholder and board member of H.J. Heinz HNZ.N, which just agreed to be bought by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N). He has also been active at Wendy’s (WEN.O) and Family Dollar Inc FDO.N. “Both of those sides should worry because he’s a force,” said an industry executive who did not want to be identified discussing Peltz. “We’ve already seen it before.” Consumer Edge Research analyst Bill Pecoriello said last month before PepsiCo’s fourth-quarter earnings report that the odds of a “significant transformational transaction” over the next one to three years was high. A potential transformation could include the separation of PepsiCo’s drink business and the acquisition of more attractive food businesses, Pecoriello said. “We see Mondelez as representative of the attributes that would enhance Pepsi’s portfolio with Danone (DANO.PA) a much lower probability given the French government’s protectionist policy,” Pecoriello wrote. General Mills Inc (GIS.N) was less attractive, he said. Trian reported a stake in PepsiCo in late 2011, a time when there was a lot of market speculation over whether the maker of Tropicana juice, Frito-Lay snacks and Quaker oatmeal was worth more broken up or together. Its share price had been stagnant for about five years and its North American drink business was losing share to that of Coca-Cola (KO.N). He later sold off the stake.

28,MDLZ,"UPDATE 2-Nelson Peltz reports stakes in Mondelez, PepsiCo; shares up","(Adds comments from analyst, investor, reported value of current stake) April 19 (Reuters) - Nelson Peltz, the billionaire behind some of the most important deals in the global food industry, has acquired stakes in Mondelez International Inc and PepsiCo Inc, a regulatory filing on Friday showed. The filing revived speculation that the activist investor would push to merge the snack giants as he did with Mondelez predecessors Kraft Foods and Cadbury. The news sent shares of Mondelez and PepsiCo higher. The often speculated-upon marriage between PepsiCo and Mondelez would bring together salty snacks like Doritos and Tostitos with sweets like Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies. The resulting behemoth would have more than $100 billion in revenue and $20 billion of operating earnings. As of Dec. 31, Peltz’s Trian Fund Management LP owned 3.93 million shares of PepsiCo and 19.4 million shares of Mondelez, according to the filing. Based on Thursday’s closing prices, the value of the combined holdings would be $903.9 million. But Trian has since increased its holdings, according to the Wall Street Journal. Citing people familiar with the matter, the paper said on Friday that the stakes were worth $2.7 billion. PepsiCo said on Friday that it has held meetings with Trian in recent weeks “to discuss and consider their ideas and initiatives.” “Trian is a respected investor, and we look forward to continuing constructive discussions with them,” the company said in a statement. It did not comment on the nature of the ideas or discussions. A Trian spokeswoman declined to comment. Mondelez declined to comment on the Trian stake, but said it was focused on “leveraging its advantaged category mix, leading market positions and strong geographic footprint.” Shares of Mondelez, which used to be part of Kraft Foods until last year, closed up 5.3 percent at $31.69 on the Nasdaq, while PepsiCo closed up 1.9 percent at $82.77 on the New York Stock Exchange. In Friday’s filing, which represented Trian’s holdings at the end of last year, it said it had 19.4 million shares of Mondelez, representing a 1.09 percent stake, and about 3.9 million shares, or 0.25 percent, of PepsiCo. “We don’t know anything specific about what Mr. Peltz is up to ... but he has a history of helping value to rise to the surface, which we’re a big fan of,” said Kevin Dreyer, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. Gabelli, based in Rye, New York, owns shares of both companies among its $36 billion in assets under management. Peltz’s influence was key in the spinoff of Dr Pepper Snapple Group from Cadbury, Kraft’s purchase of Cadbury, and the subsequent breakup of Kraft into Mondelez and Kraft Foods Group Inc. He is also a board member at H.J Heinz, which just agreed to be bought by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway  and has been active at Wendy’s and Family Dollar Stores Inc. PepsiCo undertook a big initiative last year to turn around its business, especially its North American drinks business which has lost market share to that of Coca-Cola.

29,MDLZ,Mondelez raises earnings outlook on tax benefit,"(Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) posted quarterly earnings on Tuesday that were slightly better than expected and raised its full-year earnings forecast due to a benefit from a tax item. The newly independent maker of Cadbury chocolates and Oreo cookies said net income was $568 million, or 32 cents per share, in the first quarter. That was down from $813 million, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier, before the company separated from Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O. Excluding items, earnings were 34 cents per share. On that basis, analysts on average were expecting 33 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose nearly 1 percent to $8.74 billion. That topped Wall Street’s estimate of $8.68 billion, the first time the company beat revenue estimates since it became a standalone snacks company late last year. Still, revenue growth was below the company’s long-term target, and Chief Executive Officer Irene Rosenfeld said Mondelez is “certainly not satisfied with that.” Mondelez is using its profits to reinvest in emerging markets and to boost brand-building, production capacity and distribution. “You’ll begin to see the payoff of these investments more clearly as revenue growth accelerates in the second half,” Rosenfeld told analysts. The performance of Mondelez is of particular interest this quarter, given the recent revelation that Trian Fund Management has taken stakes in Mondelez and PepsiCo Inc PEP.N.

33,MDLZ,Oreo maker Mondelez raises earnings outlook on tax benefit,"(Reuters) - Packaged foods maker Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) posted slightly better-than-expected quarterly results on Tuesday and raised its full-year earnings forecast due to a benefit from a tax item, but said it was keeping some of that benefit in reserve to guard against future market volatility. Quarterly revenue beat Wall Street estimates for the first time since Mondelez separated last year from Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O and took with it snacks like Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate and the international business of Maxwell House coffee. Still, revenue growth was below the company’s long-term target, hurt by lower coffee prices, capacity constraints and the continued struggle of its gum business, and Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld said she was “clearly not satisfied.” Mondelez is seeking growth by reinvesting in emerging markets - where it gets 40 percent of its revenue - and by boosting brand-building, production capacity and distribution. Mondelez shares fell 21 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $31.20 in after-hours trade. Through Tuesday’s close they have gained 4 percent since last month when Trian Fund Management reported stakes in Mondelez and PepsiCo Inc PEP.N. That prompted speculation that Trian’s Nelson Peltz would push them to merge given his role in Kraft’s purchase of Cadbury and subsequent breakup. In an interview on Tuesday, Rosenfeld declined to comment on Peltz or any other shareholder, which, as of December 31, also included Southeastern Asset Management and Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management. Ackman is leading campaigns involving J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) and Herbalife (HLF.N), while Southeastern is talking about teaming up with Carl Icahn to nominate directors at Dell DELL.O, according to the Wall Street Journal. “We certainly listen to all of our shareholders,” Rosenfeld told Reuters, without saying whether she has recently met with any of them. Weighing on the top line was coffee prices, which Mondelez lowered after a decline in the cost of the raw commodity, and production capacity constraints in India that prevented it from meeting the full demand for its chocolates. In addition, revenue for gum, which includes brands like Trident and Stride, fell at a “high teens” percentage rate in developed markets, the company said. But after pruning slower-selling gum products and refocusing on more successful products, the company is seeing “green shoots” in its U.S. gum business, Rosenfeld said. In April, it gained 2 percentage points of market share, she said. In the first quarter, net income was $568 million, or 32 cents per share. That was down from $813 million, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier, before the company spun off its stable of mature North American grocery brands into Kraft Foods. Excluding items, earnings were 34 cents per share, topping analysts’ average estimate by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose nearly 1 percent to $8.74 billion, north of Wall Street’s estimate of $8.68 billion. Organic revenue, which strips out the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other one-time issues, rose 3.8 percent in the quarter, below the company’s long-term target of 5 to 7 percent growth. Mondelez stood by its 2013 goal for revenue growth at the low end of its long-term growth target, and raised its earnings goal to $1.55 to $1.60 per share from a prior forecast of $1.52 to $1.57 per share. The 3 cent increase is due to a 7 cent-per-share tax benefit. The company said it was holding the other half of the benefit “in reserve ... since it’s still early in the year and considering the volatility in many of our markets.” ",5082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mondelez-results/oreo-maker-mondelez-raises-earnings-outlook-on-tax-benefit-idUSBRE9460ZU20130508

Still, revenue growth was below the company’s long-term target, hurt by lower coffee prices, capacity constraints and the continued struggle of its gum business, and Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld said she was “clearly not satisfied.” Mondelez is seeking growth by reinvesting in emerging markets - where it gets 40 percent of its revenue - and by boosting brand-building, production capacity and distribution. Mondelez shares fell 21 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $31.20 in after-hours trade. Through Tuesday’s close they have gained 4 percent since last month when Trian Fund Management reported stakes in Mondelez and PepsiCo Inc. That prompted speculation that Trian’s Nelson Peltz would push them to merge given his role in Kraft’s purchase of Cadbury and subsequent breakup. In an interview on Tuesday, Rosenfeld declined to comment on Peltz or any other shareholder, which, as of Dec. 31, also included Southeastern Asset Management and Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management. Ackman is leading campaigns involving J.C. Penney Co Inc  and Herbalife, while Southeastern is talking about teaming up with Carl Icahn to nominate directors at Dell , according to the Wall Street Journal. “We certainly listen to all of our shareholders,” Rosenfeld told Reuters, without saying whether she has recently met with any of them. Weighing on the top line was coffee prices, which Mondelez lowered after a decline in the cost of the raw commodity, and production capacity constraints in India that prevented it from meeting the full demand for its chocolates. In addition, revenue for gum, which includes brands like Trident and Stride, fell at a “high teens” percentage rate in developed markets, the company said. But after pruning slower-selling gum products and refocusing on more successful products, the company is seeing “green shoots” in its U.S. gum business, Rosenfeld said. In April, it gained 2 percentage points of market share, she said. In the first quarter, net income was $568 million, or 32 cents per share. That was down from $813 million, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier, before the company spun off its stable of mature North American grocery brands into Kraft Foods. Excluding items, earnings were 34 cents per share, topping analysts’ average estimate by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose nearly 1 percent to $8.74 billion, north of Wall Street’s estimate of $8.68 billion. Organic revenue, which strips out the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other one-time issues, rose 3.8 percent in the quarter, below the company’s long-term target of 5 to 7 percent growth. Mondelez stood by its 2013 goal for revenue growth at the low end of its long-term growth target, and raised its earnings goal to $1.55 to $1.60 per share from a prior forecast of $1.52 to $1.57 per share. The 3 cent increase is due to a 7 cent-per-share tax benefit. The company said it was holding the other half of the benefit “in reserve ... since it’s still early in the year and considering the volatility in many of our markets.”",5082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/mondelez-results/update-3-oreo-maker-mondelez-raises-earnings-outlook-on-tax-benefit-idUSL2N0DO29X20130508
35,MDLZ,Mondelez to take on Nespresso with own-brand coffee pods,"* Mondelez looking to tap premium coffee market * Nestle global leader in coffee, Mondelez No.2 * Mondelez forecasts $1 bln sales for Tassimo machine By Silke Koltrowitz and Emma Thomasson ZURICH, June 11 (Reuters) - Mondelez International, the world’s second-biggest coffee producer, is going head to head with Nestle by launching capsules compatible with its rival’s Nespresso system to steal a share of the premium coffee market. The capsules will be sold under the Jacobs and Carte Noire brands in Germany, France, Austria and Switzerland in the second half of the year - the biggest challenge yet for the $4.4 billion Nespresso brand that has sued many copycat rivals. “We see a very healthy coffee market where people like to pay more for a cup of coffee and are becoming increasingly demanding on the quality and variety of their coffee,” Roland Weening, Mondelez vice president for coffee marketing, told Reuters. “We’ll see very strong growth coming out of this particular launch.” Weening said that sales of portioned coffee pods have been growing by close to 20 percent in western Europe in recent years and could represent a third of the coffee market by 2016. Global sales of coffee pods were worth $8 billion in 2012, with $5.1 billion in western Europe, Euromonitor research shows. The snacks powerhouse carved out of Kraft Foods Inc  last year makes Cadbury’s chocolate and Oreo cookies, but 17 percent of its turnover comes from coffee and powdered drinks. Nespresso has been Nestle’s fastest-growing brand in recent years, with its recipe for success based on relatively cheap machines and costly coffee capsules, available only online or in exclusive boutiques, prompting rivals to launch cheaper copycat pods through traditional retailers. Weening said that he expects the new capsules to be competitively priced, without giving details, and that they could be launched in other markets at a later stage. Nestle has sued rivals including Ethical Coffee Co and Swiss supermarket chain Denner, but so far it has failed to obtain a definite sales ban on their products. Mondelez appears unfazed by the possibility of a legal challenge. It has done its homework on the legal implications of the launch and is ready to face any queries, Weening said. The new operation should not compromise the company’s ambitions for its own Tassimo beverage system, Weening said. Tassimo, which brews brew tea, hot chocolate and milky coffees, is expected to join the group’s billion-dollar brands soon. “Tassimo is doing very well ... it’s a profitable business,” Weening said, adding that it is the fastest-growing single-serve system in Europe, with sales up 30 percent in the first quarter. The Tassimo machine completes with Nestle’s Dolce Gusto drinks maker, D.E. Master Blenders’ Senseo and the Keurig brewer made by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc . Nor does Weening see economic weakness throughout Europe as an obstacle to success, saying that it has pushed people to drink more coffee at home. “Greece has been one of our most successful markets in Tassimo and we continue to see good growth in single-serve in Spain - and that is actually the effect of recession,” he said. Nestle said in March that its Dolce Gusto brand, launched in 2006, was about to break even and sales would soon hit 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.06 billion).

37,MDLZ,UPDATE 2-Trian's Peltz says PepsiCo should buy Mondelez,"By Martinne Geller NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - Activist shareholder Nelson Peltz said on Wednesday he wants PepsiCo Inc to buy Mondelez International Inc for around $35 a share in a deal that would be worth $62.46 billion and create a snack food powerhouse selling everything from chocolate to chips. Peltz said in a 59-page presentation published on Wednesday on Trian’s website that PepsiCo was at a “strategic crossroads” and the status quo was “unsustainable”. Peltz has played a role in some of the food industry’s biggest deals. Speaking on Wednesday at a conference that was broadcast on CNBC, Peltz said PepsiCo “doesn’t love the deal”. He also said he plans to meet with Mondelez Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld in the coming weeks. PepsiCo, maker of Frito-Lay snacks and Gatorade sports drink, has repeatedly said it sees no need for large-scale mergers. Although Trian disagrees with PepsiCo’s rationale, it said it understands that a company cannot be compelled to complete a transformational merger. “We hope they will reconsider their position,” Trian said in a statement. If PepsiCo does not pursue that deal, it must separate its snacks business from its drinks business, Trian said. A PepsiCo spokesman said the company is confident in its ability to deliver longterm shareholder value as an integrated food and beverage company. PepsiCo has already said publicly that it was weighing structural options for its North American beverage business but does not plan to discuss it until early next year. Mondelez “regularly engages in meaningful conversations with its shareholders and looks forward to meeting with Trian to learn about their perspectives in more detail,” according to a spokesman. Trian said the combination of PepsiCo and Mondelez would create substantial cost savings and would benefit both companies’ shareholders. Trian estimates the merger could lead to an implied value of $175 per share for PepsiCo and $72 per share for Mondelez by the end of 2015. Davenport & Co analyst Ann Gurkin said revenue would increase if Frito-Lay snacks were sold through Mondelez’s international distribution network. PepsiCo shares were up 1.5 percent at $85.24 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Mondelez shares rose 2.1 percent to $30.50 on the Nasdaq. The news came after sources told Reuters that a timeframe agreed upon between PepsiCo and Peltz to privately address the activist investor’s suggestions for improving shareholder returns may be closing.",7172013,http://www.reuters.com/article/pepsico-peltz/update-2-trians-peltz-says-pepsico-should-buy-mondelez-idUSL1N0FN1VS20130717

40,MDLZ,BlackRock support for PepsiCo may stymie Peltz call for Mondelez merger,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) said on Thursday it opposes Nelson Peltz’s proposal that PepsiCo Inc PEP.N buy Mondelez International (MDLZ.O) and shed its beverage business, signaling that the activist investor’s proposal could fall flat with fellow investors. “At the moment, I would disagree with him,” Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, said in an interview on CNBC. “I question how it would add long-term value.” Peltz, a PepsiCo shareholder, said on Wednesday he wants PepsiCo to buy the maker of Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate for at least $62 billion and spin off PepsiCo’s beverage business - either globally or just in the Americas or North America. PepsiCo has said repeatedly that it sees no need for large deals or splitting off its global drinks business, which includes its name-sake soft drink, Tropicana juice and Gatorade. Fink said BlackRock currently owns 5 percent of PepsiCo. Peltz’s Trian Fund Management has a stake of about $1.3 billion, or less than 1 percent, in PepsiCo, which boasts a market capitalization of more than $131 billion. With such a small stake, Peltz would have to persuade large institutional shareholders to help him bring PepsiCo to the negotiating table, said Henry Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Quality Investing, which owns just under 1 million PepsiCo shares. “I don’t think I’d bet against him,” Smith said. Trian declined to comment. Peltz, who was involved in the breakups of Cadbury Schweppes and Kraft Foods, said his cause may be helped by the fact that 37 of the top 40 PepsiCo shareholders also own Mondelez. It may be easier to woo Mondelez shareholders, said Sandy Villere III, a portfolio manager at Villere & Co, which owns Mondelez shares. “You can have your cake and eat it too,” he said, referring to the growth prospects of Mondelez on its own and any future upside from a deal. PepsiCo may be forced to move toward one of Peltz’s options if he can generate institutional support, said Smith. “But that’s not going to happen in the next few months. That’s a multiple-quarter time frame,” Smith said. PepsiCo shares closed up 1.8 percent at $86.80 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. They have gained 21 percent during the past year, as the company has made progress streamlining its business and improving its performance. Mondelez shares closed up 0.3 percent at $30.58, still well below the $35 to $38 per share price Peltz indicated for an acquisition - a sign that Barclays analyst Andrew Lazar took to mean investors remain skeptical that a deal will be consummated. “Not that many people on the buy side really believe that there’s a ton here. Many on the sell side would love to be involved in such a transaction, but not that many believe it’s going to happen,” said James Tierney, chief investment officer at WP Stewart, which used to own PepsiCo shares. Adding PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay snacks to the large international network Mondelez uses to sell Cadbury chocolates and Oreo cookies is part of the rationale for the deal, along with cost savings and the greater focus that would come from being just a snack company, following separation of the drinks business. But J.P. Morgan analyst John Faucher said the market may not have enough faith in PepsiCo management to pull off such a big deal at this point. Last year was a transition year during which PepsiCo cut thousands of jobs, pruned its portfolio and increased its marketing to reignite growth amid investor frustration at a stagnant stock price and a North American drink business that was losing ground to Coca-Cola Co (KO.N). PepsiCo’s business has improved, but analysts say the company still has more to do. “With neither company operating at full speed at this point, we think adding in massive integration would only exacerbate their problems,” Faucher said, adding that he is skeptical of any deal that involves combining store delivery networks, since disruptions can hurt sales. Of the strategic options laid out in Peltz’s analysis, the one that seems the most likely to occur is the spin-off of the North American beverage business, because the company is already considering options for it. PepsiCo has said repeatedly that it would update the market on that business in early 2014. Coca-Cola has already begun to refranchise some of its U.S. bottler system and analysts have long said they expect similar moves from PepsiCo.

Free cash flow (FCF) in 2013 and 2014 will be constrained by heightened capex  and cash restructuring payments. Capex will increase to 5% of sales from  approximately 4% to support emerging markets growth and restructuring  efficiencies associated with the 2012-2014 program. This restructuring program  has $716 million of charges remaining as of June 30, 2013. A small amount of  incremental debt is anticipated in order to complete the share repurchases as  planned, given the near-term cash flow constraints. However, Fitch does not  anticipate that total debt will vary materially from the company's current $18.1  billion level. If earnings weakness or debt financed acquisitions occur, Fitch  would expect the company to pull back on share repurchases. If not, it would  signal a change in financial policy and a negative rating action is likely. Mondelez is one of the largest global packaged food companies and maintains  substantial scale to compete effectively despite losing the diversification from  its former $19 billion North American Grocery business which was spun off Oct.  1, 2012. Fitch's expectation is that the company's approximately 40% of sales  from geographically diversified emerging markets will help Mondelez generate  faster growth than prior to the spinoff. Partially offsetting the stronger  growth prospects are significant exposure to mature markets in developed Europe  (35%) and North America (20%), lower margins than its global peers, higher  foreign exchange volatility and the discretionary nature of the snack category.  Mondelez's ratings reflect its prominent size and scale within the global  packaged foods industry, its leading market share positions in most of its  categories, and many strong brand equities. The company's business profile,  capital structure, financial strategies and expectations for growing FCF  generation support its ratings. The company should generate substantial and  increasing FCF over the longer term with a moderate dividend payout. The  company's top FCF priorities include reinvesting in its business, tack-on  acquisitions, primarily in developing markets, and returning cash to  shareholders.  Mondelez has reduced debt to $18.1 billion as of June 30, 2013 with recent debt  reduction, which was anticipated at the time of the spinoff. Total debt to  EBITDA was 3.7x and EBITDA to interest was 3.1x for the latest 12 month (LTM)  period ending June 30, 2013. Excluding spin-off and restructuring charges in  sg&a;, total debt to EBITDA was approximately 3.3x. Although leverage is  currently high for the rating category, leverage should improve moderately over  the next 18-24 months with a stronger top line, margin improvement and EBITDA  growth.  Mondelez's top line has been weaker than its long term currency neutral target  of 5-7% due to several short-term issues, such as separating the historical  Kraft Foods business in Canada, capacity constraints in India and the  pass-through of lower coffee prices. These issues are expected to dissipate in  the second half of 2013. The company has generated strong growth in chocolate  and biscuits partially offset by prolonged weakness in gum, primarily in  developed markets.  Mondelez's ample liquidity is expected to consist of its $2.5 billion cash  balance at June 30, 2013, as well as its undrawn $4.5 billion four-year senior  unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in April 2015. Mondelez is expected  to continue to have ample room under its minimum total shareholders' equity  covenant of at least $24.6 billion. The company has substantial debt maturities,  with approximately 40% of its debt due in the next five years. Upcoming debt  maturities include $1.8 billion notes due in October 2013, which it plans to  fund with a combination of cash and the issuance of CP. Beyond 2013, the company  has $1 billion notes due in 2014, $1.1 billion due in 2015, and $1.8 billion due  in 2016. Rating Sensitivities:  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include:  --Substantial and growing FCF generation, along with leverage (total debt to  operating EBITDA) consistently in the mid-2x range and maintenance of  conservative financial policies, such as refraining from a high dividend payout  and not using leverage for share repurchases;  --Consistently achieving the high end of the company's revenue and earnings  guidance.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action or Negative Outlook include:  --If earnings or cash flow falter significantly or financial policies become  more aggressive, such that leverage is consistently in the low to mid 3.0x range  with no plan to reduce leverage; --If the company consistently fails to achieve its long term revenue and  earnings guidance.

48,MDLZ,"UPDATE 3-Buffett's Berkshire buys Suncor, Dish as stock bet grows","* Berkshire adds to Wells Fargo, GM; slashes Kraft, Mondelez * Some investments kept confidential * Suncor shares rise after Berkshire reveals stake By Jonathan Stempel and Tanya Agrawal Aug 15 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc   reported new stakes in Suncor Energy Inc and Dish Network Corp as the company run by Warren Buffett added billions of dollars of stock investments. The changes were disclosed in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing made public on Thursday, which detailed $89 billion of Berkshire equity investments, mostly listed on U.S. exchanges, as of June 30. U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter, and the disclosures can offer a window into their strategies for buying and selling stocks. Berkshire took a 17.8 million-share stake in Calgary-based Suncor, which is Canada’s biggest oil and gas producer and has a large presence in the Alberta oil sands. That stake was valued at $524 million at the end of the second quarter. It also reported a small, 547,312-share stake in Dish, the satellite TV company run by billionaire Charlie Ergen, valued at $23.3 million on June 30. Suncor spokeswoman Kelli Stevens declined to comment, saying the company does not typically discuss individual investors’ holdings. Dish spokesman Bob Toevs also declined to comment. Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire discloses sizable new investments because investors try to copy Buffett, the world’s fourth-richest person according to Forbes magazine. In afternoon trading, Suncor shares were up 68 cents, or 2 percent, at C$34.47. Dish shares were down 29 cents at $44.47. David McColl, a Morningstar Inc equity analyst in Chicago, said a shortage of pipelines has forced Suncor and rivals to move more products by rail, but that Suncor has indicated an ability to address this problem in the next one to five years. “Suncor is one of the most heavily undervalued Canadian integrated oil producers,” he said. “It is no surprise that a value investor like Berkshire Hathaway would view it as a phenomenal investment opportunity.” Berkshire has benefited this year from Buffett’s preference for investments in businesses and stocks over fixed income, which has been under pressure from rising interest rates. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company’s book value per share, Buffett’s preferred measure of growth, grew 7.6 percent from January to June. Its largest stock holding, Wells Fargo & Co, grew 1.1 percent in the second quarter to 463.1 million shares, equal to a $19.1 billion stake in the fourth-largest U.S. bank. Berkshire spent $4.64 billion on stocks in the quarter.    While Buffett has said he makes Berkshire’s largest investments, some investments are made by portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who oversee several billion dollars each. Thursday’s filing did not say who bought what, but said that some holdings were reported confidentially to the SEC. Buffett sometimes gets SEC permission to amass big positions quietly so he need not worry about copycat investors. One of Berkshire’s top holdings, a $13 billion stake in International Business Machines Corp, was built in this manner. Earlier this month, Berkshire said it ended June with $101.9 billion of equity securities overall. Its top four holdings - Wells Fargo, Coca-Cola Co, IBM and American Express Co  - were worth more than $59 billion as of June 30. Berkshire also owns more than 80 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, utilities, chemicals, apparel and food. In recent months, it bought half of ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co and made several smaller acquisitions. On Wednesday, its HomeServices of America Inc unit, the second-largest U.S. full-service residential real estate brokerage, said it bought real estate service companies Prudential Fox & Roach and Trident Group for undisclosed prices. During the quarter, Berkshire added to stakes in Bank of New York Mellon Corp, automaker General Motors Co, oilfield equipment provider National Oilwell Varco Inc, US Bancorp and Verisign Inc, which assigns Internet protocol addresses. The GM share stake grew 60 percent. Berkshire slashed its stakes in food companies Kraft Foods Group Inc and Mondelez International Inc by 88 percent and 92 percent, respectively, and shed its stake in newspaper and broadcasting company Gannett Co. It also reported lower stakes in drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc and credit rating company Moody’s Corp. The SEC filing was to have been made public on Wednesday, but the release was delayed by a glitch in the regulator’s filing system. An assistant to Buffett said Berkshire submitted the filing prior to Wednesday’s deadline. In afternoon trading, Berkshire’s Class A shares were down 1.2 percent at $172,711, and its Class B shares were down 1.3 percent at $115.08.",8152013,http://www.reuters.com/article/hedgefunds-13f-berkshirehathaway-buffett/update-3-buffetts-berkshire-buys-suncor-dish-as-stock-bet-grows-idUSL4N0GG2LA20130815

50,MDLZ,Mondelez profit jumps 57 percent as sales rise in emerging markets,"(Reuters) - Packaged food company Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) reported a 57 percent jump in quarterly profit due to double-digit sales growth in Russia, Brazil and India. Mondelez, which makes Cadbury chocolates, Oreo cookies and Trident gum, however, cut its forecast for full-year net revenue growth, citing weak biscuit sales in China and lower coffee prices. Net income rose to $1.02 billion, or 57 cents per share, in the third quarter ended September 30, from $652 million, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 41 cents per share. Organic net revenue, which strips out the impact of acquisitions and other items, rose 5.3 percent.

52,MDLZ,Starbucks says $2.76 billion Kraft split was necessary,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp on Wednesday said breaking up with Kraft was hard to do, but worth the high price, after an arbitrator ruled it must pay a whopping $2.76 billion for ending the companies’ grocery coffee partnership early. The world’s biggest coffee chain will restate results for the latest quarter to show an operating loss and issue debt following the bigger-than-expected award. The payment resolves a three-year spat between the two U.S. brand titans and illustrates how costly it can be to sever a contract. “It’s difficult when a decision like this goes against you. But it is a one-time charge in a single moment in time, and now it’s behind us,” Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz said on a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. Starbucks has been posting strong revenue and profit gains despite the lackluster U.S. economy, and Schultz said the split cleared the way for the chain to significantly expand packaged coffee product sales in the grocery aisle. It “was, without question, the right strategic decision for Starbucks, our brand and our shareholders,” Schultz said. Starbucks shares closed up 1.1 percent at $81.46, after several analysts said the company’s long-term growth prospects remained promising. Kraft Foods Inc split into two companies in October 2012, Kraft Foods Group Inc and Mondelez International Inc. Under an agreement between those two companies, Mondelez will receive all proceeds from the resolution of the Starbucks-Kraft dispute. Shares of Mondelez, which makes Cadbury chocolates, Oreo cookies and Trident gum, , gained 2.7 percent to close at $33.31. An arbitrator ruled on Tuesday that Starbucks must pay $2.23 billion in damages plus $527 million for interest and legal fees for terminating its retail packaged coffee sales, marketing and distribution agreement with Kraft at least three years early. Restated results for Starbucks’ fourth quarter ended on September 29 would show a net loss of $1.64 per share, the company said on Wednesday. The Seattle-based company previously reported a fourth-quarter profit of 63 cents per share. Starbucks said it had enough cash on hand and available borrowing capacity to fund the payment, which was bigger than Wall Street expected. The company will issue $750 million in new debt in the next three months, Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead said on the analyst call. Starbucks also said it would not change its investments as a result of the ruling and repeated its forecast for fiscal 2014 earnings. Kraft began marketing and distributing bags of Starbucks coffee in grocery stores in September 1998, but Starbucks ended the contract in March 2011, giving the business to privately held Acosta Inc. The deal was set to expire in March 2014. But if it was not terminated by either party, it would renew automatically for successive 10-year terms. Schultz first alerted Kraft to his unhappiness with the partnership in January 2010. The company accused Kraft of multiple material breaches of contract, including mismanaging the brand, and in August 2010 proposed a payment of $750 million to end the deal. Kraft rejected that offer, denied any breach and said that if Starbucks wanted out, it must pay a fair value for its share of the business that brought in annual revenue of $500 million. Kraft said fair payment would be closer to $3 billion. Based on the rules of binding arbitration, Starbucks cannot appeal the decision. The date of the payment to Mondelez has not yet been determined, Alstead said.

65,MDLZ,"Peltz to join Mondelez board, ends push for PepsiCo deal","(Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), maker of Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies, on Tuesday added activist investor Nelson Peltz to its board in a compromise agreement that ends his campaign to have PepsiCo Inc PEP.N take over the company. Analysts now expect the influential investor to separately lobby each company to improve their results. Last year, Peltz urged Mondelez to sell itself to the beverage and snacks giant, but PepsiCo balked at such a deal. Trian is Mondelez’s fourth-largest shareholder, with a 2.3 percent stake, according to Thomson Reuters data. Trian also owns 0.8 percent of PepsiCo. Peltz last summer said PepsiCo was at a “strategic crossroads” due to changing consumer tastes and the rising importance of emerging markets, and outlined two scenarios for improving results. Plan A was to merge PepsiCo with Mondelez to create a larger company with one of the most valuable brand portfolios in the world. Plan B called for Pepsi to split its snacks and beverages businesses - which would allow each to focus on operational improvements. “Given that Pepsi’s not interested in Plan A, we are encouraging them to pursue Plan B,” Anne Tarbell, a spokeswoman for Peltz’s Trian Fund Management, told Reuters. Peltz, 71, also has pushed Mondelez - whose performance has fallen short of investor expectations since it was split from Kraft in October 2012 - to manage its costs better, saying it could double earnings per share by doing so. Peltz has been instrumental in numerous food and beverages mergers and divestitures at companies he believed were underperforming - including a series of deals that led to the creation of Mondelez. Mondelez shares fell as much as 3.7 percent in morning trade on Tuesday as hopes for a deal with PepsiCo evaporated. The shares were down 0.8 percent at $34.42 in afternoon trade on the Nasdaq, while PepsiCo shares were up 0.8 percent at $82.98 on the New York Stock Exchange. “While this may have been disappointing for some investors, we see this as a very amicable outcome that now allows the management team and board (at Mondelez) to focus on running the business,” Bernstein Research analyst Alexia Howard wrote in a note. Adding Peltz to the Mondelez board increased its size to 12, with 11 directors independent. The move also eliminated the risk of an expensive and lengthy proxy battle, J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said in a note. Peltz helped orchestrate the 2008 spinoff of Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS.N) from Cadbury, Kraft’s purchase of Cadbury, and the subsequent breakup of Kraft into Mondelez and Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O. In addition to Mondelez and PepsiCo, Peltz’s New York-based hedge fund’s top five holdings include Wendy’s Co (WEN.O), Family Dollar Stores Inc FDO.N and Ingersoll-Rand Plc (IR.N).

70,MDLZ,"Mondelez profit disappoints, shares fall","(Reuters) - Cadbury chocolate seller Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) on Wednesday reported quarterly profit that fell short of Wall Street estimates amid weak global demand for packaged food and vowed to do better in 2014. Shares in Mondelez, which also makes Oreo cookies and Trident gum, fell 3 percent to $32.20 in extended trading after the company noted significant softness in its cookie business in China. Deerfield, Illinois-based Mondelez said fourth-quarter net earnings totaled $1.7 billion, or $1 per share, including a 91-cent gain from the resolution of arbitration over Kraft’s grocery coffee sales battle with Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O). Adjusted earnings for the latest quarter were 42 cents per share, including a two-cent-per-share hit from currency translation. Analysts, on average, expected a profit of 44 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue was down 0.1 percent to $9.49 billion, but organic net revenue, which strips out the impact of acquisitions and other items, rose 2.5 percent. Its gum business performed well, but its China business took a hit as distributors there reduced biscuit, or cookie, inventory Mondelez on Wednesday said its organic revenue growth rate would be “at or above our category growth rate,” which it forecast at about 4 percent in 2014. “We’re disappointed that our results were below what we and our shareholders originally expected,” Mondelez Chairwoman and Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld said in a statement. “We’re committed to improving results in 2014 and beyond.” Mondelez, which was spun off from Kraft in 2012, has estimated full-year earnings of $1.78 to $1.78 per share.

73,MDLZ,"Mondelez, D.E Master Blenders to merge coffee businesses","(Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) and competitor D.E Master Blenders 1753 are merging their coffee businesses in a deal aimed at taking on market leader Nestle SA The merger announced on Wednesday will marry Mondelez’s grocery coffee brands such as Carte Noire and Gevalia with D.E Master Blenders’ L’OR, Pilao and Senseo brands. The new company will be a joint venture controlled by D.E Master Blenders’ parent JAB Holding Co. Mondelez, whose shares were up nearly 8 percent in midday trading, said it would receive about $5 billion and a 49 percent stake in the new combined company. The company, to be called Jacobs Douwe Egberts, will be run by the current management of D.E Master Blenders, and will be based in the Netherlands. The deal clears the way for Mondelez to focus on its snacks business, best known for Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies, and is the latest move by JAB to raise its profile in the global coffee market. With annual revenue of more than $7 billion, the new company will be the world’s No. 1 pure-play coffee company, though still significantly smaller than the coffee business owned by Nestle. The new company will focus on the grocery and home-brewing side of the global coffee business, D.E Master Blenders Chairman Bart Becht told Reuters. Becht, who is also JAB’s chief executive, will be chairman of the new company. Pierre Laubies, chief executive of D.E Master Blenders, will become CEO of the combined company “It’s a story of cross-fertilization,” said Becht, adding that the merger opens opportunities to introduce the Senseo home coffee brewer to new markets and allows the new company to expand in the instant coffee arena. JAB, a holding company controlled by Germany’s billionaire Reimann family, bought the owner of Douwe Egberts coffee last year in a 7.5 billion euro ($10.4 billion) deal. It also bought U.S. coffee chains Caribou Coffee and Peet’s Coffee & Tea in 2012 for $340 million and $1 billion, respectively. Caribou and Peet’s, which compete with Starbucks (SBUX.O) and Dunkin Brands Group (DNKN.O), are not part of the new company. Neither is Mondelez’s coffee business in France, though JAB has made a binding offer for that business. Mondelez, which also reported a stronger-than-expected first-quarter profit on Wednesday, separately announced a $3.5 billion restructuring program designed to cut costs, boost margins and address the main complaint of activist investor Nelson Peltz, who was recently named to the company’s board. Wall Street analysts who cover Mondelez called the coffee merger “strategic” and “elegant” in client notes. They said it should remove Mondelez’s coffee business, which accounts for about 11 percent of its global sales and which has had to grapple with volatile green coffee prices, from its operating results in a way that bolsters earnings. Mondelez said it would use a majority of the $5 billion proceeds to expand its $2 billion share buyback program, and the remainder to pay down debt. The deal is expected to close in 2015, subject to regulatory approvals. After that, Mondelez expects snacks to account for about 85 percent of net revenue, compared with 75 percent currently, Mondelez Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld said on a conference call. The deal is expected to add to adjusted earnings in the first year after completion, Mondelez said. D.E Master Blenders was advised by Lazard, BDT, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, while JAB was advised by Bank of America and Morgan Stanley. Mondelez was advised by Perella Weinberg Partners and Centerview Partners.

The Dow and the S&P; 500 moved into positive territory after Yellen said the U.S. economy was still in need of lots of support, given the “considerable slack” in the labor market in remarks to the congressional Joint Economic Committee. Yellen’s comments enabled investors to shift attention to what may be an easing of the tensions in Ukraine, as Russian President Vladimir Putin called on pro-Moscow separatists in Ukraine to postpone a vote on secession just five days before it was to be held. But the Nasdaq remained under pressure as stocks such as Amazon.com Inc, down 2.6 percent at $289.55; Facebook Inc, down 2.8 percent at $56.91; and Google Inc , down 1.6 percent at $514.31, all weighed heavily on the index. The Nasdaq has dropped more than 2 percent over the past two sessions. “Janet Yellen didn’t say anything new in her testimony. She continues to talk about how they are data dependent, how they can change on a dime, but she didn’t say rates are going up any time soon, which is exactly what people expected,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. “Coupled with the fact that technically the market found some support, then (investors) started concentrating on what Putin said,” Polcari added. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 92.48 points or 0.56 percent, to 16,493.50. The S&P; 500 gained 3.53 points or 0.19 percent, to 1,871.25. The Nasdaq Composite  dropped 42.892 points or 1.05 percent, to 4,037.867. Whole Foods Market Inc also contributed to the Nasdaq’s decline as the organic grocer’s stock tumbled 19 percent to $38.82. The stock was the biggest drag on both the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes a day after Whole Foods posted second-quarter results and cut its 2014 outlook.

78,MDLZ,RLPC-Banks prepare $10 bln loan for Dutch Master Blenders,"LONDON, May 13 (Reuters) - Banks have lined up around 7.5 billion euros ($10.32 billion) of loans to refinance debt in Dutch coffee and tea company DE Master Blenders 1753 and back its merger with the coffee business of Mondelez International , banking sources said on Tuesday. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley are leading the financing which is expected to launch for syndication to other banks and institutional investors in the coming weeks, the banking sources said. As part of the merger, Mondelez will receive around $5 billion in cash, as well as a 49 percent equity stake in the new company, which will be called Jacobs Douwe Egberts. The $5 billion of cash is expected to be in the form of a leveraged loan denominated in euros and dollars. It will form part of a larger financing package as Master Blenders refinances a 3.3 billion euro loan put in place last year to back a 7.5 billion euro acquisition by Joh A Benckiser, the banking sources said. The 3.3 billion euro leveraged loan was arranged by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Rabobank and Morgan Stanley and comprised a 1.25 billion euro Term Loan A, a 300 million euro revolver; a 1 billion euro institutional Term Loan B2, all paying initial margins of 350bp over Euribor; along with a 750 million euro Term Loan B1 paying 375bp. The new loan is also expected to include around 500 million euros of a undrawn facilities.

79,MDLZ,RLPC-Loan market set to profit from Master Blenders' jumbo deal,"LONDON, May 16 (Reuters) - Dutch coffee and tea company DE Master Blenders’ 7.5 billion euro ($10.29 billion) loan to refinance a hugely successful deal in 2013 and raise new money to back its merger with the coffee business of Mondelez International will soak up a lot of excess liquidity in the market, banking sources said. The all-loan financing will be the largest leveraged loan issued by a European borrower since the 9 billion pound ($15.12 billion) financing backing the Alliance Boots buyout by KKR in 2008, providing a boost to Europe’s leveraged loan market which has been plagued by a lack of M&A; in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. “Banks and investors are crying out for more event-driven activity and the market feels ripe for more M&A.; The Master Blenders deal is exactly what the loan market needs,” an investor said. As part of the merger, Mondelez will receive around $5 billion in cash, as well as a 49 percent equity stake in the new company, which will be called Jacobs Douwe Egberts. The M&A; is expected to close in 2015. The $5 billion of cash is expected to be in the form of a leveraged loan denominated in euros and dollars and will form part of a larger financing package as Master Blenders refinances a 3.3 billion euro loan put in place last year to back a 7.5 billion euro acquisition by Joh A Benckiser. The new loan is also expected to include around 500 million euros of undrawn facilities. JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley are leading the financing, which is expected to launch for syndication to other banks and institutional investors in the coming weeks. The borrower is opting for an all-loan deal, shunning the bond market to take advantage of the more flexible, private and cheaper loan product. “A loan can be prepaid at par as there aren’t any non-call features. It is also a private instrument which means the borrower doesn’t have to blast information about the company across the world,” a second investor said. A bond would require financial statements that reflect the combined businesses so the company would need to take out an expensive bridge loan before it could be in the position to issue bonds. Bonds also go into escrow and require the borrower to pay a full margin straight away, whereas loans are cheaper as they allow a borrower to pay a ticking fee. The loan market has the capacity for such a large financing but the deal will need to be priced correctly in terms of interest margins and ticking fees if it is to tap all the liquidity needed during primary syndication and maintain a good level in secondary. Loans in Dutch cable company Ziggo traded lower on the secondary markets as it paid a margin of 300bp, tighter than the other deals by the same owner Liberty Global. It is also still paying a ticking fee. “Bankers need to be cognisant of pricing as a lot of investors will earmark a substantial amount of cash for the Master Blenders deal which will not fund for quite a long time. Lenders need to be compensated,” the first investor said. A third investor added: “Ziggo was a delayed process where the deal got done but the loan traded off because it wasn’t funding and people were not being compensated. In Europe, a lack of attractive ticking fees is a problem especially in Master Blenders’ case if investors have to wait until 2015.” In order to keep a large number of existing banks in the deal and attract new banks, the deal is expected to be covenant-loose and retain leveraged and interest covenants, as opposed to being covenant-lite. French cable company Numericable lost a lot of liquidity when a number of banks couldn’t cashless roll into its new covenant-lite loans that backed its acquisition of Vivendi’s telecom unit SFR and refinanced existing debt. Only a limited number of CLOs that invested in Master Blenders’ 3.3 billion euro loan last year will be past reinvestment period but the company is still considering allowing lenders to cashless roll into the refinanced loans via an amendment. If a cashless roll were to occur, there could be different pricing for the refinanced money and new money. “The US market has softened in recent weeks and pricing has widened by 50bp-75bp as a result. Master Blenders could pay around 350bp with a 75bp floor,” a banker said. The 2013 3.3 billion euro leveraged loan comprised a 1.25 billion euro TLA, a 300 million euro revolver; a 1 billion euro institutional TLB2, all paying initial margins of 350bp over Euribor, along with a 750 million TLB1 paying 375bp.

84,MDLZ,RLPC-Master Blenders' 7.6 bln euro acquisition loan prices,"LONDON, June 11 (Reuters) - A 7.6 billion euro-equivalent ($10.35 billion) loan that finances Dutch coffee and tea company DE Master Blenders’ merger with the coffee business of Mondelez International and refinances existing debt was priced on Wednesday, bankers said. The deal is the largest leveraged loan to be issued by a European company since the 9 billion pounds ($15.11 billion) buyout financing which backed the buyout of Alliance Boots by private equity firm KKR in 2008. Banks and funds are lining up to back Master Blenders’ deal, which is led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley, and is expected to boost Europe’s leveraged loan market which has seen thin M&A; activity in 2014. Mondelez and Master Blenders announced in May that they would combine their coffee businesses into a new company called Jacobs Douwe Egberts (JDE), based in the Netherlands. The financing includes a 500 million euro, five-year revolving credit and a 2.9 billion euro, five-year term loan A, both of which pay 300 basis points (bps) over Euribor. These tranches, which are known as ‘pro-rata tranches’ are among the largest seen in Europe, sources said. They will refinance a 3.3 billion euro leveraged loan, which backed Joh A Benckiser’s (JAB) 7.5 billion euro acquisition of Master Blenders in 2013. Banks were asked to commit 225 million euros to the revolving credit and term loan A, which are both already oversubscribed. “JAB has a lot of relationship banks. The fund community is less known to them, which is why they wanted such a large pro-rata piece. It has gone extremely well,” a banker said. A 3 billion euro, seven-year term loan B, and a 1.2 billion euro, seven-year dollar-denominated term loan B are also included which both pay 325 bps with a 75 bps Euribor/Libor floor, which guarantees minimum returns for investors. The term loan B is being raised from fund investors that will be offered a ‘ticking fee’ until the acquisition closes in 2015, which will give some income before the M&A; deal completes. As part of the merger, Mondelez will receive around $5 billion in cash, as well as a 49 percent equity stake in JDE. The financing was shown to investors in London on Wednesday and will be shown to US investors on Friday, sources said. Master Blenders was not immediately available to comment.

85,MDLZ,Competing halal standards leave food industry with indigestion,"KUALA LUMPUR, June 16 (Reuters) - The storm of bad publicity that hit confectioner Cadbury in Malaysia after its chocolates tested positive for traces of pork highlights the costly, religious minefield food companies must navigate as they rush to tap the surging $1 trillion global halal market. One of the biggest headaches for corporations like Mondelez International, Nestle and Unilever PLC  is the lack of a unified standard for what exactly is halal, or permissible under Islamic law, despite years of efforts by Muslim authorities to come up with a global benchmark. As a result, global food firms face higher production costs as they must comply with a mix of national processing standards that can vary widely even within the same country. Failing to navigate these differences leaves companies exposed to the risk of using ingredients permissible under one standard but not another. “Obviously it’s not good to have so many standards. It’s confusing,” said Jamil Bidin, the chief executive of Halal Industry Development Corporation, an agency linked to Malaysia’s government. Muslim-majority Malaysia is regarded by many Muslim countries as a global leader in halal food processing due to its established certification experience and developed industry. Islam requires practicing Muslims to consume halal products, and, at its most basic, that means foods and drinks that do not contain any alcohol or pork. To be deemed halal, livestock must be slaughtered as the name of Allah is invoked. Big food firms have been ramping up their investment and expertise in halal, eyeing a fast-growing Muslim population that is forecast to add a billion people by 2050 with rising education and income levels. The market to process, produce and distribute halal food and drinks will grow into a $1.6 trillion industry by 2018 from about $1 trillion in 2012, according to DinarStandard, a research firm specialising in Muslim markets. But industry executives say the lack of global or regional benchmarks is stunting the industry’s potential at a time when countries such as Japan and Australia are jumping on the halal bandwagon to cater to a rising number of Muslim travellers. “We welcome efforts to ensure consistency in halal certification and would support a global standard, or perhaps wider regional standards, to help simplify the landscape,” a spokesman for Cadbury’s parent firm Mondelez said. Halal standards are emotive topics in Muslim countries, as Cadbury’s recent problems in Malaysia showed. Several Muslim consumer groups called for a boycott of all Cadbury and Mondelez products after the health ministry said it had detected traces of pig DNA in Dairy Milk chocolates. The news generated an online furore and prompted several rounds of testing by authorities from neighbouring Indonesia, home to the world’s biggest Muslim population, to Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam. Further testing by Malaysia’s Islamic affairs agency, the country’s sole official halal certifier, however, showed that the initial tests had not been definitive and the chocolate was actually halal. But the incident has sparked a heated debate among Islamic scholars in Malaysia over whether substances derived from pork such as gelatin can be considered halal. “We expect there wouldn’t be a repeat of such an incident as this could ruin the halal industry, in Malaysia especially,” said Othman Yusoff, chairman of the halal committee of the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers. Domestic politics and vested interests have also proved to be a stumbling block so far. The 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which calls itself the collective voice of the Muslim world, is trying to draft global halal guidelines with the backing of Dubai, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. But that movement, the Standards and Metrology Institute for the Islamic Countries (SMIIC), does not include Malaysia and Indonesia - home to large halal-certification centres. “What is critical is that there is interoperability among standards, and transparency,” said Rafi-uddin Shikoh, chief executive of New York-based consultants DinarStandard. “An exporter intending to export food from Sudan should know and deliver easily the halal certification requirements from almost any market they feel they can grow in.” Defining what exactly constitutes halal is an issue of hot debate among Islamic scholars, which makes agreeing on a global standard difficult. For example, more conservative interpretations hold that each animal must be slaughtered by a hand-held knife. Britain has two main halal certification boards with conflicting stances on whether animals can be stunned before slaughter. The kingdom of Brunei, which has a strict interpretation of Islamic rules, sends auditors to neighbouring Malaysian factories to check imports for halal-worthiness. Another factor complicating the search for a single standard is the intense rivalry between countries for a slice of the industry. U.S. cereal maker Kellogg Co. and chocolate maker Hershey Co., for example, are building halal-compliant plants in Malaysia, with investments of $130 million and $250 million respectively. Dubai is setting up testing and certification centres to profit from the halal business. Malaysia has been pushing its own standards, as has Turkey. “It’s silos,” said Darhim Hashim, the director of the International Halal Integrity Alliance, which is working with the OIC to create common standards. He said one way forward would be for the Gulf countries, Malaysia and Indonesia to agree minimum standards. “I think naturally the rest would follow - those are the key markets, the most regulated import markets.”   (Additional reporting by Lisa Baertlein in LOS ANGELES and Martinne Geller in LONDON; Editing by Miral Fahmy)",6152014,http://www.reuters.com/article/food-halal/competing-halal-standards-leave-food-industry-with-indigestion-idUSL1N0ON07U20140615
86,MDLZ,RLPC-Lenders pushback on Master Blenders' 7.6 bln euro loan,"LONDON, June 19 (Reuters) - Lenders have asked to change the terms of a 7.6 billion euro ($10.36 billion)-equivalent loan that finances Dutch coffee and tea company DE Master Blenders’  merger with the coffee business of Mondelez International and refinances existing debt, banking sources said on Thursday. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley are leading the financing and are in discussions with institutional investors, which are concerned over the prospect of not earning any fees for the first year and inability to remain invested in the existing loan, under the new deal’s structure. The deal includes a 2.9 billion euro term loan A (TLA) and 500 million euro revolving credit, both paying 300 basis points (bps) and a 4.2 billion euro-equivalent dual-currency term loan B (TLB), paying 325bps with a 75bps floor. The pro rata tranches will refinance a 3.3 billion euro leveraged loan, which backed Joh A Benckiser’s 7.5 billion euro acquisition of Master Blenders in 2013. Institutional investors are pushing back as they have not been offered a cashless roll on the TLB, as it will be made up of new money to fund the merger.  A refinancing usually triggers a repayment and reinvestment of money but a cashless roll allows investors to go into a refinanced deal without being repaid first. Since a number of CLOs that invested in last year’s financing are now past their reinvestment period, they will not be able to reinvest the cash in any new deals once repaid. “For CLOs past reinvestment period, the loan is getting repaid which means managers lose assets under management, fees and equity investors lose yield,” a banking source said. Some lenders want an institutional carve out on the TLA to enable a cashless roll. One of the sources said a 200 million euro TLA institutional carve out would be large enough to satisfy demand. An advantage to the TLA is that it is due to fund in the next couple of weeks whereas the TLB is not due to fund until the acquisition closes in 2015. “Banks find it far easier to sit on an unfunded commitment than a fund. It is perplexing they have chosen to do it this way round, especially as the company needs to tap a lot of liquidity” a second banking source said. Other lenders want an improvement to a ticking fee. As the TLB will not fund until the acquisition closes in 2015 a ticking fee has been offered and is expected to pay nothing for the first 60 days, 50 percent of the margin between 61 and 90 days, the full margin during 91-330 days, and the full margin plus the floor after 330 days. As it stands the ticking fee will not pay anything out for a year and will accrue instead. It could also be put into escrow. Some investors feel it is too long to be committed to a deal without receiving cash. Investors also worry that if the M&A; does not go ahead, they will be left with nothing. “The funds are being asked to buy something that does not fund for a year, which isn’t good for equity distributions for the first year of a CLO.  If the M&A; does not happen, the investors will not be in a good position after being repaid by the TLA and earning nothing on the ticking fee. What has been proposed is leaving funds too exposed and it is risky,” the first banking source said. A decision and any changes to the deal are likely to emerge in the coming days once US investors have also had time to digest the information. The original issue discount is expected to be around 99-99.5. Mondelez and Master Blenders announced in May that they would combine their coffee businesses into a new company called Jacobs Douwe Egberts (JDE), based in the Netherlands. As part of the merger, Mondelez will receive around $5 billion in cash, as well as a 49 percent equity stake in JDE. [ID: nL3N0NT3UP] Master Blenders declined to comment.

87,MDLZ,UPDATE 1-Chocolate maker Barry Callebaut sales volume growth slows in first nine months,"* Nine-month sales volumes rise 2.4 pct on stand-alone basis * Barry blames low cocoa price, profitability focus on slowdown * Confirms mid-term targets   (Adds CFO quotes, details) By Caroline Copley ZURICH, July 3 (Reuters) - Barry Callebaut, the world’s biggest chocolate maker, said on Thursday sales volumes growth slowed to 2.4 percent in the nine months to the end of May. The Zurich-based company, which makes chocolate for Nestle , Unilever  and Mondelez  among others, is benefiting from a trend among big food groups to outsource chocolate production. But a lull in outsourcing deals in recent months and a focus on profitability in Western Europe has kept volume growth at Barry Callebaut below that of levels seen in earlier years. Low cocoa powder prices also discouraged aggressive expansion of production. “As we continue to focus on increasing our product margins, we concentrated on selective growth in developed markets,” Chief Executive Juergen Steinemann said in a statement. On a stand-alone basis, nine-month sales volumes rose 2.4 percent. This was below the group’s mid-term target of 6-8 percent per year, and slower than the 3.1 percent achieved in the first half of the year. Including the cocoa business acquired from Petra Foods  at the end of 2012 and consolidated since July 2013, sales volumes grew 15.8 percent. Chief Financial Officer Victor Balli attributed the slower stand-alone volume growth to the company’s reluctance to push cocoa powder volumes given the relatively low price levels and a focus on profitability in Western Europe. “Another reason why we slowed down a bit was also because we didn’t implement larger outsourcing deals in the last months, but we have a few upcoming which we will now implement,” Balli said in an interview, adding the outsourcing pipelines look “very attractive”. On top of industrial production, Barry Callebaut also supplies restaurants, bakeries and catering services with ‘gourmet’ chocolate products, a high-margin business that grew 6.9 percent in the first nine months of the financial year. Balli said the gourmet business and emerging markets, where volumes surged 63 percent, would continue to drive growth. In Western Europe, volumes slipped 0.2 percent as the company focused on improving product margins. Barry Callebaut confirmed its mid-term targets for 6-8 percent average volume growth per year and to restore profitability to pre-acquisition levels by 2015/16.

89,MDLZ,Mondelez to separate cheese & grocery business in Europe,"(Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc, maker of Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies, said it would create a “stand-alone” European cheese and grocery business to focus on its fast-growing snacks business, including biscuits, gum and candy. Mondelez shares were up 1.3 percent at $38.49 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. The company has been increasing its focus on its portfolio of snack foods and refreshments, which includes 53 brands that each generated annual revenues of $100 million or more in 2013. “Given the impact of the coffee transaction on our European operations, we’ve decided to create a predominantly stand-alone cheese and grocery category in Europe,” Mondelez spokesman Mike Mitchell said in an e-mail. Mondelez and rival D.E Master Blenders 1753 said in May they would merge their coffee businesses in a deal aimed at taking on market leader Nestle SA. A stand-alone cheese and grocery category would likely have a dedicated sales team to focus on selling products exclusively, rather than a full array of products across categories, Mitchell said. The segment would be managed independently. The European cheese and grocery business’ president will report to the president of Mondelez Europe. The company expects its European business to be 90 percent snacking-focused after the coffee deal with Master Blenders, Mitchell said.

90,MDLZ,UPDATE 1-Mondelez to separate cheese & grocery business in Europe,"(Updates source, adds comments from spokesman, shares, details) By Devika  Krishna Kumar July 11 (Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc, maker of Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies, said it would create a “stand-alone” European cheese and grocery business to focus on its fast-growing snacks business, including biscuits, gum and candy. Mondelez shares were up 1.3 percent at $38.49 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. The company has been increasing its focus on its portfolio of snack foods and refreshments, which includes 53 brands that each generated annual revenues of $100 million or more in 2013. “Given the impact of the coffee transaction on our European operations, we’ve decided to create a predominantly stand-alone cheese and grocery category in Europe,” Mondelez spokesman Mike Mitchell said in an e-mail. Mondelez and rival D.E Master Blenders 1753 said in May they would merge their coffee businesses in a deal aimed at taking on market leader Nestle SA. A stand-alone cheese and grocery category would likely have a dedicated sales team to focus on selling products exclusively, rather than a full array of products across categories, Mitchell said. The segment would be managed independently. The European cheese and grocery business’ president will report to the president of Mondelez Europe. The company expects its European business to be 90 percent snacking-focused after the coffee deal with Master Blenders, Mitchell said. The cheese and grocery segment accounted for about 10 percent of European sales for the quarter ended March 31.

95,MDLZ,Mondelez cuts sales target after price hike backlash,"(Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), the maker of Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies, cut its 2014 sales target on Wednesday after price hikes to cover commodity costs sparked a backlash by consumers and retailers in some European markets.  Mondelez also reported higher net income in the second quarter, topping Wall Street estimates. Mondelez said higher cocoa and dairy prices this year prompted the price increases to customers, especially in places like Venezuela and Argentina with high inflation.  Since competitors have been slow to follow, the company said, some retailers have stopped selling Mondelez products altogether. “While we anticipated that this would be disruptive in the short term, it has been even more challenging than we expected,” Irene Rosenfeld, chairman and chief executive officer, said on the quarterly earnings conference call. She added that she expected the impact to be temporary as competitors catch up with price hikes and the gap closes. The company said it was reducing its 2014 net organic revenue growth target to a range of 2 percent to 2.5 percent. In May, it forecast growth of about 3 percent. Organic revenue excludes changes in foreign currency, takeovers and acquisitions.   “In Europe, some large retailers reacted badly to the price increases, and temporarily removed products from the shelves,” Alexia Howard, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said in a research note. “It sounds as though this is now behind them and so we believe this was a temporary hit to sales this quarter.” Mondelez shares were down 0.7 percent at $35.71.  Organic revenue in emerging markets rose 4.7 percent, below company forecasts. Sales in developed markets, like Europe, were down 1.2 percent. “Some customers, especially in Europe, most notably in France, have reacted quite severely to our price increases,” Rosenfeld said.  Mondelez isn’t the only company to feel the pain from raising prices. Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O, spun off from Mondelez in 2012, said in July its second-quarter revenue barely rose as price hikes hurt customer demand.  Other chocolate makers like Hershey Co (HSY.N) and Mars Chocolate North America, the maker of M&M;’s and Snickers and a subsidiary of Mars Inc, have raised prices for the first time in three years due to the higher costs of cocoa and in particular cocoa butter. Cocoa futures prices have soared more than 30 percent in the past year and hit three-year highs this week.  Higher dairy costs have also played a role in the increase in chocolate prices. Net income at Mondelez increased to $622 million, or 36 cents per share, from $601 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier.  Revenue declined 1.8 percent to $8.4 billion. Organic revenue was up 1.2 percent.  Bernstein’s Howard said organic sales growth was “particularly disappointing,” given that the Easter holiday, which typically boosts growth, came out in the second quarter this year.  Organic sales in North America rose 2.7 percent on share gains in biscuits and candy. Excluding the effects from recalculating assets in Venezuela and other items, earnings were 40 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected 39 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

98,MDLZ,"Asia Cocoa-Butter offered above $8,000/T; chocolate makers stay away","* Butter ratios hold near strongest level since December * Powder prices unchanged, may fall to attract buyers By Lewa Pardomuan SINGAPORE, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Chocolate makers stayed away from the physical market this week as Asian cocoa butter ratios held near their highest since December, dealers said on Wednesday, while grinders could cut powder prices to lure buyers. Cocoa processing in Asia has risen in the past two years as more companies set up grinding facilities in Indonesia to secure bean supply. Although demand for butter has generally been steady, grinders are struggling to sell cocoa powder. About 40 percent of cocoa that is ground ends up as powder, another 40 percent as butter and the rest as paste and cocoa liquor. Butter gives chocolate its melt-in-the-mouth texture, while powder is used in cakes, ice cream, biscuits and drinks. Cocoa butter ratios, an indicator of demand, were unchanged from last week at 2.40 to 2.45 times London futures <0#LCC:>.  Butter prices are calculated by multiplying London and New York bean futures by the ratio, with the values currently at between $8,000 and $8,200 a tonne. Butter prices stood at about $6,800 a tonne in January. “Trading has frozen and nothing has moved. It’s about time that Asia slowed down. Grinders with old cake stocks will probably be selling their powder cheaply,” said a dealer in Indonesia. “It’s better for you to do it, rather than not moving the product at all.” When processing beans, grinders initially get cocoa cakes, which they press into powder. Grinders often refrain from turning cakes into powder when demand is weak. Powder prices were unchanged at between $1,500 and $2,100 a tonne, but dealers said it was unlikely buyers would chase powder at prices above $2,000 because of ample stocks. Grinders do not reveal the size of their powder stocks. London cocoa futures <0#LCC:> have gained more than 17 percent this year on expectations demand will outstrip supply in the current 2013/14 crop year. [SOF/L[ Cocoa bean prices have risen sharply this year due to speculative buying, causing chocolate makers such as Nestle , Mondelez International, Mars Chocolate North America and Hershey Co to raise chocolate prices in recent months.

99,MDLZ,Tough time to sell Ukraine president's 'mouthwatering' candy empire,"LONDON (Reuters) - A chance to buy the candy empire of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko is the kind of opportunity in a fast-growing market that would normally have multinational confectioners - like Nestle or Cadbury’s parent Mondelez - drooling at the prospect.  But despite owning factories in four countries and making $1.2 billion in annual sales, Ukraine’s “chocolate king” may have a hard time finding a buyer for his company, now that its founder is the leader of a country at war. “It’s all academic given the political situation at the moment,” said a financial source closely following the situation.  “But at its core it makes your mouth water.” After years of combining his career as a billionaire candy boss with posts in successive governments, Poroshenko promised when he was elected in May to sell Roshen, the confectionary empire named for the middle two syllables of his surname. He has since hired advisors Rothschild and local firm Investment Capital Ukraine to drum up investor interest. On paper, there is a lot to tempt investors. Eastern Europe is a region with a sweet tooth, accounting for 12.8 percent of global candy sales despite a much smaller share of the world’s population. Roshen is the region’s second biggest locally-owned producer, ranked 18 in the world by net sales according to the Candy Industry Top 100. Apart from its main factories in Ukraine, it has plants in EU members Lithuania and Hungary as well as in Russia. In a region where tastes are still dominated by local habits, its decorative assortment boxes with names like “Kiev Evening” and “Royal Dessert” hold their own against global chocolate brands. Although it could be broken up into parts, an asking price that insiders say is likely to be around $1.5 billion means the company is probably too big to be swallowed whole by domestic players in Ukraine. That would seem to make it a perfect target for firms like Switzerland’s Nestle or Mondelez, the U.S. snack and confectionary business split off from Kraft that includes Britain’s Cadbury. Both are investing in the region and not shy about acquiring local brands. Nestle has looked at buying other confectionary businesses in Ukraine, the sources said, while Mondelez announced in April it is spending $110 million to open its fifth factory in Russia next year. But finding a buyer for a company associated with a war-time leader is no simple matter. Until last year, Russia accounted for about a fifth of Roshen’s sales. But Moscow banned imports of Roshen’s Ukrainian chocolates to Russia last year, officially on health and safety grounds, and shut its Russian factories in March in a criminal case that Kiev says is politically motivated. Since July, Russia has banned all Ukrainian chocolates. Kiev says Russian forces have supported pro-Russian separatists in the east of Ukraine in a conflict which has killed more than 3,000 people, although a ceasefire has been in place for a week. Moscow annexed Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula in March and President Vladimir Putin now calls eastern Ukraine “New Russia”, although he denies involvement in the war. Those close to the effort to sell Roshen say the company’s prospectus is being shopped despite the conflict. “Contact has been made with prospective buyers but it’s very preliminary,” said one of the sources, who declined to be identified as the process is private. “This is a big and complex situation and any sale is not going to happen in a few weeks. Don’t expect anything imminent.”  Financial sources closely following the deal said that given the tense political situation, any sales process is likely going to be complicated because commercial or strategic logic won’t apply. Large international players are unlikely to table bids before the conflict is clearly over, they said. Roshen did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. ICU could not be reached. Rothschild declined to comment beyond confirming that it had been hired.  Roshen would be attractive to confectionary companies in the low-to-mid-market chocolate range who are keen on expanding in emerging markets and willing to navigate political interference.  Mars, the world’s biggest chocolatier, is unlikely to be interested because it only markets its own brands. But in addition to Nestle and Mondelez, interested parties could include Korean firm Lotte which entered the region in 2010 with the purchase of Poland’s Wedel from Kraft Foods, and Turkish food manufacturer Ulker.

102,MDLZ,Variety is key in Mondelez coffee growth strategy,"LONDON (Reuters) - Offering an array of hot and cold single-serve drinks is central to the growth strategy of Mondelez International Inc’s (MDLZ.O) European coffee business, which will soon merge with D.E Master Blenders 1753. With regulatory approval expected in coming months, the merged business, to be called Jacobs Douwe Egberts, will continue to invest heavily in a single-serve coffee business able to compete better with Nestle’s NESN.VX market-leading brands Nespresso and Dolce Gusto, said Roland Weening, president of coffee for Mondelez Europe. “We already have over 90 drinks and we believe there is a market for more. Watch this space,” Weening told Reuters. Mondelez’s Tassimo system sells portions of Jacobs coffee, Milka hot chocolate and Twinings tea that can be served hot or cold, while D.E Master Blenders’ Senseo system sells L’Or Espresso cups compatible with Nespresso machines.  Coffee in single-serve packs for use with at-home brewing machines is a global retail market worth $10.8 billion, according to Euromonitor International. About 61 percent of that market is in western Europe, where Nestle has a 41-percent share. The merged businesses of Mondelez and D.E Master Blenders would have a near 25-percent share in western Europe. Worldwide, the retail market grew 22 percent last year, much faster than traditional coffee or bottled drinks, as it appeals to well-heeled consumers who like the convenience of fast, barista-style espressos and lattes at home. Weening is bullish on machines that serve hot and cold drinks, but is not yet convinced of the opportunity for carbonated soft drinks, which is being pursued by rival Keurig Green Mountain GMCR.O with Coca-Cola (KO.N).  It is “something that others are looking at but we don’t see that yet as a significant development,” he said, declining to say whether the company would engage in a similar partnership.  “I’m not speculating on any of the potential things we might do in the future, but of course it is a growing market with a lot of opportunities ... so we clearly want to continue to take advantage of all opportunities out there,” he said. “Who knows what the future may bring? “To have a multi-beverage system as we have with Tassimo, that is able to do different drinks — hot, cold, etc — is where I think in the future, the game will be,” he said.  Mondelez, which also sells Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies, increased spending on Tassimo by 40 percent last year, in marketing, research and development, and production capacity. Spending is on track for a similar rise this year, Weening said, and the brand should remain “a top priority” next year.  While the Tassimo machine and its compatible packs are positioned at the higher end of the market, with some drinks costing as much as $0.50 per cup, Weening said Senseo was cheaper, and therefore did not overlap too much.

103,MDLZ,Mondelez plans $90 mln biscuit plant in Bahrain,"ABU DHABI, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Packaged food company Mondelez International is planning to build a $90 million biscuit plant in Bahrain to reduce costs and meet growing demand for its biscuits, the U.S. company said on Wednesday. The maker of Oreo, Ritz and Cadbury chocolate aims to start full commercial production in early 2016, operating four manufacturing lines with an initial capacity of 90,000 tons annually. “This investment in Bahrain is part of our ongoing supply-chain reinvention plan,” Daniel Myers, Mondelez International Executive Vice President, Integrated Supply Chain, said in a statement. “We’re implementing several such initiatives around the world to capitalize on growing demand, while also reducing costs and improving productivity,” he said. The company expects to deliver $3 billion in gross-productivity savings, $1.5 billion in net savings and $1 billion in incremental cash over the next three years to help it improve its operating-income margin, the statement said. The new plant will create about 300 jobs, the company said. Mondelez has already invested more than $75 million in a Kraft Cheese and Tang-powdered beverage plant in Bahrain. Mondelez, formerly Kraft Foods, has operated in the Middle East for more than a century from its regional base Dubai.

104,MDLZ,Surging U.S. sugar price to boost food company costs -trade group,"NEW YORK, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Food manufacturers such as Mondelez International and J.M. Smucker Co.  will face billions of dollars of additional costs this year due to soaring sugar prices, according to estimates from a sugar buyers group. U.S. sugar prices have surged 40 percent since the U.S. sugar industry initiated a trade case with Mexico. That will cost food manufacturers an additional $2.4 billion in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, according to a Thursday report from the Sweetener Users Association. The U.S. Commerce Department in August made a preliminary decision to impose countervailing, or anti-subsidy, duties on sugar from Mexico in response to allegations from the U.S. sugar industry that Mexican mills were dumping cheap, subsidized sugar into the U.S. market. Domestic prices for refined sugar have jumped about 7.6 cents a lb since the cases were filed, translated to an additional $837 million in sugar costs for food manufacturers, said Tom Earley, a food policy consultant at Agralytica in Virginia and author of the report. Industry pressure and tensions have mounted ahead of the Friday deadline for the Department’s initial determination on potential dumping duties, which would be added to anti-subsidy duties of up to 17.01 percent. The costs could grow from there, depending on the size of any the antidumping duties, Earley said on a conference call regarding the report. “We have the decision coming up on dumping duties. Those would clearly push up prices,” he said. Domestic sugar prices hit multi-year lows last year on surging output in Mexico and the United States. Mexico’s sugar mills have had unfettered access to the U.S. market since the 2008 implementation of NAFTA in the sugar market. While the Sweetener Users Association does not identify its members, the trade case has meant a jump in prices and supply uncertainty for sugar buyers that include candy makers like Hershey Co. and Mars Inc. Though data is not yet publicly available, the U.S. Agriculture Department has estimated that Mexican sugar imports plunged to about 28,300 tons in September after the U.S. government began collecting the first round of duties. That was down by two-thirds from the previous month and by more than 80 percent from September 2013.

106,MDLZ,Kraft Foods profit falls as price hikes hit sales,"(Reuters) - Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O said quarterly profit fell nearly 11 percent as price hikes, designed to offset higher commodity costs, hit demand for its popular products such as Velveeta cheese and Jell-O desserts. Kraft’s shares were down 1.8 percent at $55.87 in after-hours trading. The company, which also makes Oscar Mayer meats and Kool-Aid beverages, said gross margin fell to 29.3 percent in the third quarter ended Sept. 27, from 33.8 percent a year earlier.  The company said sales growth at its cheese foods business, which makes up 21 percent of total revenue, was slower than that of the U.S. cheese market as it raised prices to counter “an unrelenting dairy cost environment”. Kraft has been raising prices on more than half its products. At the same time, it has been offering discounts to boost sales at its meals and desserts business, where revenue fell 6.7 percent as consumers increasingly reach for healthier, organic food over desserts and processed items. Rival General Mills Inc (GIS.N) reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit last month on weak demand for its packaged foods and beverages such as Green Giant canned and frozen vegetables and Progresso soup. General Mills CEO Ken Powell told Reuters at the time that sales of non-durable goods, which include food and beverage items, have been flat to down for the industry.  Kraft’s net income fell to $446 million, or 74 cents per share, in the third quarter, from $500 million, or 83 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue edged up 0.1 percent to $4.40 billion. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 74 cents per share on revenue of $4.47 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

107,MDLZ,UPDATE 3-Mondelez raises full-year profit outlook despite decline in third quarter,"(Updates share price, adds background, CEO comments) By Anjali Athavaley Nov 5 (Reuters) - Snacks maker Mondelez International Inc  raised its full-year forecast on Wednesday and topped analysts’ expectations even as it reported an 11 percent drop in quarterly profit on weak sales in Europe. Mondelez, the maker of Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate, raised its full-year 2014 earnings outlook to $1.82 to $1.87 per share, adjusted for items like currency. Previously, the company forecast $1.73 to $1.78 per share. Shares rose 6 percent to $37.10 in midday trading on Wednesday. Like other companies in the food industry, Mondelez has faced sluggish markets in some of its key categories. The company reported a string of disappointing quarterly results since it split from Kraft Foods Group in 2012, and investors have called on Mondelez to respond to tepid demand and changing consumer tastes by cutting costs. “The biggest impact we’re seeing on our business is our consumer remains very value conscious around the world,” said Chief Executive Officer Irene Rosenfeld in an interview. She added that “in this challenging market, we have been quite focused on what we can control, and that has been to drive productivity and cost reduction.” Earlier this year, Rosenfeld said Mondelez had retained the consulting firm Accenture to implement a zero-based budgeting system, where business units need to justify all costs each year. She said in the interview that the new system is “helping folks to plan budgets at a more granular level,” thereby reducing overhead costs and boosting margins. Net income totaled $899 million, or 53 cents a share, for the third quarter, down from $1.01 billion, or 56 cents a share. Earnings per share, when adjusted for items like acquisitions, was 50 cents per share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters were expecting 39 cents a share. Overall revenue during the quarter declined 2 percent to $8.3 billion. Adjusted for the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, sales rose 3 percent during the period but were down 2 percent in Europe as some retailers in France stopped carrying Mondelez’s products. In August, Mondelez said that price hikes that it had implemented to cover commodity costs had sparked a backlash from retailers in some European markets. Rosenfeld said on the company’s third-quarter earnings call that by the end of the quarter, most of the disputes with retailers had been resolved.

111,MDLZ,Mondelez to buy 80 pct of Vietnam's Kinh Do Corp's snack business,"NEW YORK, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc  said on Tuesday it will pay $370 million to buy an 80 percent stake in Vietnamese company Kinh Do Corp’s snack business. Mondelez, based in Deerfield, Illinois, already has a small presence in Vietnam selling some of its Oreo, Ritz and Cadbury products. Mondelez will acquire two Kinh Do manufacturing facilities, as well as Kinh Do’s distribution network. The deal will allow Mondelez to build scale. Kinh Do is Vietnam’s biggest confectionary producer and makes products such as Cosy biscuits and Solite soft cakes. Vietnam has a growing middle class, and 60 percent of the population is under 30 years old, presenting an opportunity to attract younger generations to Mondelez products. “It’s a perfect fit for our Asian growth strategy,” Tim Cofer, president of the Asia Pacific business, said in an interview. Mondelez has an option to buy the remaining shares of Kinh Do’s snack business a year after the completion of the initial deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015. Mondelez split from Kraft Foods Group Inc in 2012 and stumbled out of the gate as an independent company with a string of disappointing quarterly results that led the company to undertake several cost-cutting initiatives. “The opportunity to continue to invest in high growth emerging markets in the core categories where we compete is fundamental to our growth strategy,” Cofer said. Mondelez has struggled in the Asia Pacific region. Sales there when adjusted for currency are down 3 percent year-to-date, mainly because of weakness in demand for biscuits in China and the company’s own missteps in that market. Cofer expects business in China to turn around. In the most recent quarter ended Sept. 30, China was up in the high single digits, partly driven by the company’s new thin Oreos, which have been a success with young adult females, he said.

113,MDLZ,"For billionaire Warren Buffett, P&G;'s tide has crested","NEW YORK, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co., one of Warren Buffett’s top portfolio holdings, is about to lose the billionaire’s influential backing at a time when it appears the company’s own fortunes have peaked. Thursday’s agreement by Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  to turn over the $4.7 billion in shares it owns in the world’s largest consumer products company in exchange for P&G;’s Duracell battery business comes one day after P&G; shares hit a life-time high. “He is basically cashing in at a 52-week high,” said Doug Kass, who runs hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management in Palm Beach, Florida. “He is stating in transaction that Duracell is inexpensive and P&G; stock is expensive. And accomplishing this all in tax-efficient transaction.” Buffett’s transaction provides an exit from an investment he began making a quarter century ago, and on which he had already been dialing back. Under the deal, P&G; will infuse about $1.8 billion of cash into Duracell before the expected closing in the second half of 2015. Berkshire became one of P&G;’s biggest shareholders as a result of Buffett’s investment in Gillette Co. P&G; bought Gillette in 2005 in a $57 billion deal that Buffett supported. Berkshire held more than 101 million P&G; shares in 2007 and cut the stake several times since then as the consumer-goods company faltered under previous Chief Executive Officer Bob McDonald. Berkshire had fewer than 53 million shares as of June 30. Although P&G; shares hit a life-time high of $89.88 on Wednesday, they have underperformed the market. Since its market bottom in March 2009, P&G; has doubled in price. That pales next to the 147 percent gain in P&G;’s peer sector, the S&P; consumer staples index, and the tripling in value of the wider S&P; 500. And P&G; shares are expensive. They are trading at roughly 20 times forward earnings compared with a peer median of 18.7 times, and 16.5 times cash flow versus a peer median of 14.2. That means P&G; is more expensive than half its peers in arguably one of the market’s priciest sectors. The forward price-to-earnings multiple for the entire S&P; 500 is about 16, according to Thomson Reuters data. To be sure, P&G;’s 3.7 price-to-book ratio is cheap relative to the 5.3 median for its peers. Buffett favors measuring Berkshire’s own worth using growth in book value per share, instead of the stock price. In recent years, Berkshire has shed most of its multi-billion-dollar stakes in oil company ConocoPhillips  and Kraft Foods Inc, the latter of which has since split into two companies. Buffett was unhappy with Kraft’s decision in 2010 to buy the British confectionery company Cadbury.

116,MDLZ,UPDATE 1-Kraft to raise K-Cup coffee prices for first time,"(Adds milestone to paragraph 1, details, background) NEW YORK, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Kraft Foods Inc, the maker of Maxwell House coffee, said on Wednesday it will raise prices on most of its U.S. single-serve coffees for the first time, extending its price increases to a more lucrative market. Kraft will raise the price of its Maxwell House, Gevalia, McCafe and Yuban K-Cup portion packs by about 9 percent, effective Dec. 28, due to sustained price increases in associated raw material markets, a company spokeswoman said in an email. This comes after the large U.S. roaster raised prices on its Maxwell House and Yuban roast and ground coffee brands by about 10 percent in June, its first increase in three years, and its premium Gevalia brand by around 7 percent the following month. Other major U.S. roasters also raised their roast and ground prices around that time, but single-serve was excluded. On Nov. 3, Keurig Green Mountain Inc, the maker of single-serve K-Cups, raised its portion pack prices. Single-serve coffee pods carry significantly larger profit margins than roast and ground coffee sold in traditional canisters. Arabica coffee futures prices have been extremely volatile in 2014 and reached the highest level in more than 2-1/2 years in October at $2.29 per lb, after a drought in top grower Brazil was followed by a dry period during the critical flowering period. Its price is currently around 45 percent higher from the end of 2013, marking the biggest gains by far on the 19-market Thomson Reuters CoreCommodity CRB Index.

125,MDLZ,Velveeta revives as young and poor shop dollar stores for groceries,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Anielle Troyan, a call center worker in New York, shops at discount retailers such as Family Dollar for items like soap and detergent as well as groceries like Kraft macaroni and cheese and small-sized condiments. It’s “expensive to cook for one,” she said. “I’m 25, I’m poor, I’m usually going to buy what’s cheapest.”  Customers like Troyan are one reason why Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O reversed course after considering stopping the sale of single-serve packages of Velveeta cheese sauce, which wasn’t moving in traditional grocery stores. After another look at the numbers, Kraft found that shoppers on tight budgets at dollar stores were gobbling up Velveeta sauce in the affordable small size, and the food got a new lease on life. The fall and rise of Velveeta shows how companies such as Kraft, General Mills Inc (GIS.N) and Campbell Soup Co (CPB.N) are following shoppers into dollar stores, which carry a host of private label and brand name products, typically priced between $1 and $10. As an improving U.S. economy still leaves some middle class customers tumbling towards the poverty line, food companies are searching for growth where lower income consumers shop.  “We’re in the business of feeding all American families, and that’s where consumers are going,” said Tom Lopez, vice president of growth channels at Kraft. Packaged food sales were flat in 2014 as people increasingly avoided the brands typically found in the center aisles of grocery stores in favor of the fresher food found on the perimeter. But in other types of stores, such as dollar, drug and club, sales are growing faster than grocery store sales, prompting companies to expand distribution. Dollar stores flourished during the recession and remain in the spotlight: Family Dollar shareholders in January approved the sale of the company to Dollar Tree Inc (DLTR.O) for about $8.5 billion in cash and stock and rejected a $9.1 billion all-cash offer from Dollar General, citing antitrust concerns.  An aging population is also driving the push by packaged food companies into dollar stores. General Mills says it’s seeing more baby boomers at dollar stores looking for smaller quantities, so it expanded its snack offerings there to include the Fiber One brand. Sales in dollar and drug stores rose 8 percent last year, company officials said.   At Kraft, sales at club, dollar and drug stores also rose 8 percent in the first three quarters of 2014, four to five times faster than sales in all channels. Improving distribution to dollar stores could help Kraft reinvigorate sales in the United States, where it has struggled with flat sales growth and higher commodity costs. Since its split with Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) in 2012, the majority of Kraft’s business comes from sales of North America grocery items.  “They have been for a very long period of time this kind of staple of the middle class,” said Robert Passikoff, president at Brand Keys, a brand consultancy in New York. “That doesn’t really seem to be the case anymore. If people are not flocking to those brands, you need to be able to look for other audiences and other distribution points.” Since its spin-off from Mondelez, Kraft has appointed a 13-person team to focus on untraditional sales channels. Sales to dollar stores saw double digit percentage growth in 2014 from the prior year. The strategy faces some challenges. Even with an improving economy and low gas prices, low income consumers remain cautious about their spending. “While on paper, it appears that the economy is improving, the low to middle income consumer who is our core customer continues to look for ways to manage her budget as she works to prioritize her spending and she trusts that we are on her side to help her stretch her budget,” said Dollar General’s chief executive Rick Dreiling on the company’s earnings conference call in December. Kraft operates an in-house kitchen, where it tests recipes that it hopes will appeal to budget conscious consumers and tries to figure out how families stock their pantries, said Robin Ross, director of Kraft Kitchens.  “There is no room for waste,” she said. “There is no room to choose products and recipes that won’t go over well in our families. We know that in some of these households there might be higher propensity to buy canned foods or vegetables because there is more of a guarantee that those products won’t go bad before it’s time for use.”  Shrinking package sizes allows Kraft to reach higher profit margins on products, though it won’t sell as many as it would in a larger store. For instance, a 12-ounce package of Velveeta Shells & Cheese cost $2.50 at the a Dollar Tree store in New York City. Meanwhile, a 2.4 ounce cup cost $1.25. That’s 21 cents an ounce versus 52 cents an ounce.  Not all brands work well in dollar stores, company officials said. Many health and wellness brands can’t compete on price in the channel, and food makers point out other limitations for more premium products. A Campbell Soup spokeswoman says, for instance, that most stores have limited refrigeration space, which is needed for many of its Bolthouse Farms products.  Industry watchers expect more fresh products to eventually be available at dollar stores. “When you look at natural, organic, gluten-free foods, these are products that are demanded across all income classes,” said Peter Keith, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. “It is important for the dollar stores to shift some of the mix to those items. That’s where the broader population in the U.S. is moving.” ",2052015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kraft-dollarstores-insight/velveeta-revives-as-young-and-poor-shop-dollar-stores-for-groceries-idUSKBN0L91DE20150205
126,MDLZ,"Mondelez beats profit forecast, sees higher margin in 2015","(Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), the maker of Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies, reported a better-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit and said it expects cost cuts to boost its full-year adjusted operating margin in 2015.  The company on Wednesday said it expects the margin to be about 14 percent in the year ending Dec. 31, up from 12.9 percent in 2014.  “This should be good enough, we think,” said JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman in a note. “2015 guidance (including EPS, organic sales and margins) came in roughly as we anticipated.” Since its split from Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O in 2012, Mondelez has focused on margin expansion as the company, like others in the food industry, faces sluggish growth in developed markets and volatility in emerging ones. It has cut costs and implemented zero-based budgeting, which requires managers to justify every cost for each new period.     The company’s shares were up 1.7 percent to $36.42 in early afternoon trading. Still, Mondelez faced questions about weakness in key markets. Net revenue in Europe, Mondelez’s biggest market by sales, fell 6.7 pct.  The company said on its earnings conference call that competitors have still been slow to catch up to the price increases it implemented to cover higher commodity costs in the region.  “The reality is a number of our multinational competitors have just lagged a little bit in pricing response, and that has put some pressure on the business,” Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld said. Mondelez said it expects organic net revenue to grow at least 2 percent in 2015, helped by a decision to focus on its snacks business, which it has done by hiving off its coffee and other businesses. The company, which gets over 80 percent of its revenue outside the United States, said a strengthening dollar would hit revenue growth by about 11 percentage points and adjusted profit by about 30 cents per share. Net revenue fell about 7 percent to $8.83 billion in the fourth quarter and missed analysts’ average estimate of $8.88 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 2.9 percent on an organic basis, Mondelez said. Net income attributable to the company fell nearly 72 percent to $500 million, or 29 cents per share. Excluding costs related to restructuring and a merger of the company’s coffee business with D.E. Master Blenders, Mondelez earned 47 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 43 cents.

130,MDLZ,"Kraft Foods shakes up leadership, reports quarterly loss","(Reuters) - Kraft Foods Group Inc said on Thursday that its chief financial officer would leave her role and two other senior executives would depart from the company, marking the first major changes at the maker of Velveeta cheese and Oscar Mayer meats since its board chairman took over as chief executive in December.  Kraft said the shakeup, which includes the creation of a “vice president of growth initiatives”, was aimed at accelerating the pace of change at the company. In December, the company announced that its chairman John Cahill would replace  Chief Executive Tony Vernon who stepped down. In his first earnings conference call since he took over as CEO, Cahill said, “It’s clear that our world has changed and our consumers have changed, but our company has not changed enough.” Cahill declined to give specifics on his strategy until the second quarter of the year but said the company would focus on developing products based on consumer insights and spend on more efficient advertising. The company has been battling sluggish demand for its older brands in the United States, where many consumers want fresher foods with higher quality ingredients. As part of the change, Chief Financial Officer Teri List-Stoll will be leaving her role effective Feb. 28. Chief Marketing Officer Deanie Elsner and Chuck Davis, executive vice president of research and development and quality and innovation, will leave the company. Jane Hilk, president of the enhancers and snack nuts division, has been appointed interim chief marketing officer. Kraft said the finance division would report to Cahill until a CFO was appointed. List-Stoll, who joined Kraft in September 2013, will stay on as a senior adviser to ensure a smooth transition. “Three people after this guy has been on the job 50 plus days seems like an awful quick, swift move,” said Brian Yarbrough, analyst at Edward Jones. “But I think his whole point is they’re not innovating fast enough, and they’re not coming out with the right type of marketing.” Analysts said investors also will be watching Cahill’s approach to Kraft’s portfolio regarding potential acquisitions and divestitures.  “We have wonderful brands but they are not all created equal,” Cahill said. “At the end of the day our brands are phenomenal brands as they are, and so, our first and foremost focus will be on making them work.”  When asked about his approach on cost-cutting, Cahill said, “As I see it today, there remains plenty of opportunity to take costs out without jeopardizing in any way our top line.” Kraft’s shares were down 1.9 percent at $64.90 in extended trading on Thursday.

Combining Mondelez International’s coffee business with its Netherlands-based rival would create the world’s second-biggest coffee company after Nestle. European Union antitrust regulators said earlier on Monday they had extended their review of the proposed tie-up until June 1 because they were unhappy with the solutions offered so far by the two companies. The merger would significantly reduce competition for roast and ground coffee in France, Denmark and Latvia, as well as for filter pads in France and Austria, EU antitrust regulators have said. “We are proposing a new remedy package,” Mondelez and D.E. Master Blenders 1753 said in a joint statement in response to the competition enforcer’s concerns. The new option was the sale of the “Carte Noir brand for all coffee formats across the European economic area, including the divestment of the brand in-home Roast & Ground, filter pads and Nespresso compatible capsules businesses”, the companies said, adding that it replaced a previous offer to sell the L’Or and Grande Mere brands. Italy’s Lavazza had offered more than 600 million euros  ($680 million) for L’Or and Grande Mere together and was raising cash for the acquisition, hoping for a positive response from the EU antitrust body. The Italian coffee maker will evaluate “any future opportunity as the transaction (between Mondelez International and D.E. Master Blender) develops”, Lavazza said in a statement without elaborating.

His last day was Friday and has been replaced by Udo Kagerbauer, who is based in Switzerland and was named director for global cocoa commodity price risk management at Mondelez, he said. “I expect to continue in commodities,” said Amoye, who was based in New Jersey. He declined to say what his plans are or which company he may be joining. A Mondelez spokesman declined to comment on the moves, citing the Illinois-based company’s policy not to discuss personnel changes. Amoye joined British chocolate maker Cadbury in 2009 as vice president of global commodities. Cadbury would later be bought by Kraft Foods Group Inc, Mondelez’s former parent. Almost 18 months later, he became senior director of global commodities for coffee and cocoa when Cadbury was bought by Kraft in 2010. Following Kraft’s decision to spin off its snacks and chocolate business, creating Mondelez in September 2012, he became senior director for global commodities sourcing and risk, managing the global cocoa and cocoa products teams. Earlier in his career, he had been a cocoa trader for 20 years at London-based commodities trader ED&F; Man. Mondelez was the second-largest chocolate company in the world in 2014, according to data from the International Cocoa Organization, with sales of $14.4 billion, trailing Mars at $18.5 billion. His departure comes at a critical time for the cocoa industry as chocolate makers such as Hershey Co hiked retail prices due to the soaring cost of cocoa beans and dairy, hurting sales. Competition among merchants and bean processors is also intensifying after a series of deal making. Last year, Archer Daniels Midland Co sold its cocoa and chocolate operations to Olam International Limited  and Cargill Inc, respectively, and in January, Noble Group Ltd decided to wind down its cocoa operations.

136,MDLZ,"U.S. CFTC sues Kraft, Mondelez over alleged wheat price manipulation","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Wednesday charged Kraft Foods Group Inc and Mondelez International Inc with manipulation of prices of wheat used in products such as Oreo and Chips Ahoy cookies. The regulator alleged that Kraft and Mondelez bought $90 million of wheat futures, or a six-month supply, but never intended to take delivery of the grain. The two then earned more than $5.4 million in profits as a result of market shifts in reaction to the enormous position, the CFTC said in its complaint. “A market participant who is not happy with cash prices available to it may not resort to manipulative trading strategies in an attempt to artificially lower that price,” CFTC enforcement head Aitan Goelman said in a statement.  The regulator said it was seeking a permanent injunction from future violations by the two companies, as well as disgorgement and civil monetary penalties. Kraft said it did not expect the matter to have a financially material impact and that Mondelez International would predominantly bear the costs of the matter. The complaint focused primarily on trading that occurred before the two companies split in 2012, Kraft said. Mondelez declined to comment. It has said in a previous regulatory filing that it was being investigated by the CFTC, and that it would seek to resolve the matter prior to any formal action being taken. It said at the time it expected to predominantly bear the cost of the probe, but that this would not have a material effect on results. The CFTC said that the companies had also violated speculative position limits, and that they had engaged in numerous noncompetitive trades in wheat.

140,MDLZ,Kraft Foods emails lay out plan to depress U.S. wheat prices -CFTC,"CHICAGO, April 2 (Reuters) - Emails between former senior executives at Kraft Foods, including its chief financial officer and a top procurement director, are among the evidence in a U.S. lawsuit accusing the company and Mondelez International of manipulating wheat prices. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Wednesday accused Kraft Foods Group and Mondelez  of making massive bets in Chicago’s futures markets in late 2011 as part of a plot to drive down the physical price for wheat they used to make products ranging from Oreos to Ritz crackers. Kraft, which spun off its snacks business into Mondelez in 2012, said Mondelez would bear most of the costs of the case. Mondelez declined to comment. The CFTC filed the manipulation charges partly using power derived from the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul. The agency in 2013 used the provision in obtaining a $100 million settlement against JPMorgan Chase & Co for its “London Whale” trades. Dry weather around the world was pushing up wheat prices when the U.S. regulator alleges Kraft and Mondelez devised a plan to manipulate markets to save millions of dollars buying the grain. At the time, Kraft was one the country’s top users of a type of “soft” wheat used to make cookies and crackers and consumed about 30 million bushels a year, which represents about 7 percent of last year’s crop, the CFTC said. The company was not eager to pay up for physical wheat, according to the lawsuit. Instead, Kraft made a dramatic change to its buying practices by entering contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade for $90 million of wheat futures representing a six-month supply, the regulator said. Company executives wanted to “induce sellers to believe” Kraft planned to take delivery of loads of wheat, when the company never intended to take delivery, according to the CFTC. An October 2011 email to Kraft’s former CFO and other senior executives from the company’s senior director of global procurement laid out the plan to depress prices, according to the agency, which included a snippet in the lawsuit. Another email from the procurement officer six weeks later confirmed the strategy was working, the CFTC said. The lawsuit did not name the executives. Kraft was in line to save $7 million on the commercial cost of wheat and make up to $3 million from moves in the futures market “if all goes according to plan”, the second email said, according to a portion contained in the lawsuit. Typically, Kraft had bought most of its wheat directly from farmers or dealers on the physical market, and aimed to keep a two month’s supply in its inventory, the lawsuit said. The company had never before owned 15 million bushels, which was three times its storage capacity, according to the CFTC. Kraft, as a hedger, is supposed to use futures to offset the risk of a position in the physical market and to enter trades in ways that are not disruptive to the marketplace. But U.S. regulators say Kraft impacted the futures market and caused physical prices in Toledo, Ohio, where the company grinds 90 percent of the wheat it buys into flour, to drop 5 percent during the first week of December 2011. Kraft earned more than $5.4 million by manipulating the markets, according to the CFTC. CME Group Inc, which owns the Chicago Board of Trade, declined to comment. Scott Irwin, an economist at the University of Illinois, said the relatively small profit for Kraft made the regulator’s manipulation charges seem strange. “If you’re going to manipulate the market, I would think that they would do it in a bigger way than that,” he said. The case is U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Kraft Foods Group Inc and Mondelez Global LLC, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 15-cv-02881.

141,MDLZ,Indian taxman demands $88 million from Cadbury in tax dispute,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s tax office has demanded about 5.5 billion rupees ($88 million) from the local arm of chocolate maker Cadbury, now Mondelez International Inc, in a dispute over a factory in the foothills of the Himalayas, government officials said. India, under pressure to reduce its budget deficit, has sought to boost fiscal revenue, not least by pursuing billions of dollars in unpaid tax claims against large multinationals in recent years. But it has also vowed to step back from what critics call “tax terrorism” after high profile cases, such as bumper claims against Vodafone Group Plc, threatened to tarnish its reputation. India’s tax authorities began investigating Cadbury in 2011, accusing it of misusing an exemption provision in the hill state of Himachal Pradesh that allowed a “tax holiday” scheme. Tax authorities said Cadbury’s new unit in the region was not operational at the end of March 2010, when the holiday ended, and was therefore not eligible. They said it began commercial operations months later. Tax authorities in Himachal Pradesh said Mondelez India had been asked for about 5.5 billion rupees, a sum which includes payments dating back from 2010 onwards and a fine. Media reports on Monday put the fine at around 2.3 billion rupees. Mondelez India disputed the charge and said in a statement that it had correctly claimed an exemption to the excise duty, adding that its factory has been working since 2009. “The issue is one of interpretation, and it will be inappropriate on our part to discuss the details externally at this time since the matter is sub-judice and in the legal domain,” the company said in a statement.

U.S.-based Mondelez in February proposed the sale of Carte Noire to soothe European competition concerns about a merger of its own coffee business with Netherlands-based D.E. Master Blenders 1753. It was not immediately clear how much Carte Noire, one of France’s best-selling premium coffee brands, might be worth. Sources told Reuters Lavazza had offered more than 600 million euros ($639.4 million) for the smaller L’Or and Grand Mere brands Mondelez had initially proposed selling before the EU rejected that plan. Lavazza switched its sights to Carte Noire to grow outside its home turf. “We are officially in (the race) and there is a chance that some investment funds may present a rival bid,” Giuseppe Lavazza said on the sidelines of an event in Paris. “Negotiations will likely finish by the end of June,” Lavazza added. The final closing of the deal would then depend on regulatory clearance by the European Commission.  Lavazza, which was granted exclusive rights to consider buying Carte Noire, will have four weeks from a yet to be announced date to look at the books before other suitors are admitted to its data room, a source close to the company said.

146,MDLZ,"Kraft, Mondelēz wheat price manipulation hurt traders: U.S. lawsuit","(Reuters) - Kraft Foods Group Inc and Mondelēz International Inc are being sued in a proposed class action on behalf of wheat futures and options traders for allegedly manipulating the grain’s price.     The lawsuit was filed on Thursday by futures trader Richard Dennis in the federal court in Chicago, eight days after the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued both companies. In that case, the CFTC alleged that the former Kraft Foods Inc in late 2011 bought $90 million of wheat futures despite never intending to take possession of the grain. The regulator said it did this to depress prices in the cash wheat market, where sellers might believe the companies needed less wheat, and inflate futures prices. Kraft’s strategy led to more than $5.4 million of illegal gains, the CFTC said. In Thursday’s complaint, Dennis raised similar claims, and accused Kraft and Mondelēz of manipulating prices of cash wheat and wheat futures contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade from 2003 to January 2014, boosting revenue and trading profit. “While these illicit profits benefited defendants’ bottom line, they caused harm to class members who transacted in CBOT wheat futures contracts at artificial prices,” Dennis said. Kraft had no immediate comment. Mondelēz spokeswoman Valérie Moens declined to comment. Both companies have indicated that Mondelēz would bear most costs of the CFTC case, and that the outcome would not be material to either’s results. A lawyer for Dennis did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment. The companies are defendants in both lawsuits because the alleged suspicious trades occurred before Kraft Foods Inc in 2012 split in two. Mondelēz now houses snack foods such as Oreos, Wheat Thins and Ritz crackers, while Kraft sells its namesake cheese products, Oscar Mayer deli meats and Maxwell House coffee. Last month, Kraft agreed to sell itself to H.J. Heinz Co, which is owned by Brazilian firm 3G Capital and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. The case is Dennis v.

148,MDLZ,REFILE-Kraft case to test Dodd-Frank muscle,"(Adds ampersand to law firm name) By Mike Kentz NEW YORK, April 13 (IFR) - Allegations of fraud and manipulative trading by Kraft Foods in derivatives markets are garnering attention beyond the fact that a household food and beverage-maker has been thrust into a regulatory doghouse normally reserved for the world’s largest banks. The case could also affect the rest of the US corporate market as the CFTC seeks to expand the definition of manipulation in derivatives markets by using a new enforcement tool provided by Dodd-Frank regulations for the first time since the law’s passage. “If Kraft is found guilty it will significantly expand the ability of the CFTC to prosecute firms transacting in large size in derivatives markets,” said Robert Zwirb, former CFTC lawyer and consulting attorney at Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft. “The CFTC’s use of Rule 180.1 has yet to be tested, and with Kraft’s apparent intention to litigate this matter, we may soon find out just how powerful a tool the provision will be.” CFTC Rule 180.1 allows the agency to allege and prosecute fraud and manipulation in derivatives markets without having to prove that the firm in question intended to be fraudulent or manipulative. The agency only has to prove the firm acted in a reckless manner. Kraft is being pursued for breaches of a number of rules, including 180.2 - a well-worn anti-manipulation provision - and others. But it is the first test of the new 180.1 rule that makes this case stand out. At issue in the case is a set of large orders placed by Kraft in the wheat futures market in November 2011 that were later stopped just prior to delivery. The firm bought US$93.5m of futures contracts set to deliver wheat in December, well over the firm’s storage capacity of US$50m of wheat, which was 80% full at the time, according to the CFTC complaint. Kraft later stopped the order prior to delivery and bought wheat in the cash market. During that time, cash prices declined and the spread between December and March futures narrowed, netting the company a US$5.4m profit, according to the CFTC. The play could be construed as a basic arbitrage strategy - futures and cash prices were dislocated at the initiation of the strategy but upon convergence the firm adjusted its position in the interest of good business. But lawyers say the firm has some explaining to do based on the sheer size of the position. The futures order would have delivered 15m bushels of wheat and constituted 87% of open interest in the wheat futures market at one point. “Kraft has some difficult facts to contend with  in 35 years of practicing in this area, including at the CFTC, I have never seen a situation in which a trader held 87% of the open interest in the spot month contract,” said one commodity derivatives lawyer. Kraft is yet to respond, so lawyers can only guess what the defense will be. Kraft and Mondelez International, a spin-off entity included in the complaint, have said in reports they plan to “vigorously litigate this matter”. The Kraft case will be the first time use of the provision reaches court. The CFTC cited Rule 180.1 in its enforcement action against JPMorgan for its London Whale transgressions, but the bank settled out of court. The widened standard is a product of agency complaints that former enforcement standards around manipulation were too weak, since proving intent is a difficult standard to meet. “In my opinion Kraft/Mondelez may be guilty of something, but I don’t think the transgressions fit under the new provisions,” said another former CFTC lawyer. The finding in the case will be key for US corporates that use futures markets in large size for hedging product sales or feedstock purchases - as was the case for Kraft in connection with wheat. US corporates have fought against being roped into a proposed tightening of limits on the size of speculative positions a firm can take in commodity derivatives markets - another rule Kraft is alleged to have violated. As such, the case is likely to take on increasing importance for US corporates as they continue to deal with Dodd-Frank-driven changes to derivatives markets. “The case has implications for all end-users that hedge risks in futures markets because it underscores that the requirements of the commodities laws, and the need for strong compliance procedures, are not limited to the likes of banks and trading firms who we typically view as being regulated by the CFTC,” said Melvin Brosterman, partner in the litigation practice at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan. “If Kraft can be charged, so can any end-user.” A version of this story will appear in the April 11 edition of IFR Magazine.

149,MDLZ,Kraft removing synthetic colors from iconic macaroni & cheese,"(Reuters) - Kraft Foods Group Inc on Monday said it is revamping its family-friendly macaroni and cheese meal, removing synthetic colors and preservatives from the popular boxed dinner. The move comes at a time when Kraft is battling sluggish demand as consumers shift to brands that are perceived as healthier, including foods that are organic or less processed.  The company has also been targeted by consumer advocacy groups. The groups have pressured Kraft to remove artificial food dyes from its products, complaining that the additives are not used, and in some cases, banned in other countries.Kraft spokeswoman Lynne Galia said the changes were being made to address concerns expressed by consumers, including demands for improved nutrition and “simpler ingredients.” “We know parents want to feel good about the foods they eat and serve their families,” Galia said in an emailed statement about the changes to its macaroni and cheese product. Galia said the changes will be effective by January 2016 for “Original Kraft Macaroni & Cheese” in the United States. The company is also removing synthetic colors by the end of 2016 in Canada for its Kraft Dinner Original.     In 2014, Kraft launched its Mac & Cheese Boxed Shapes with no synthetic colors, and in January of this year, the Northfield, Illinois-based company moved to no artificial preservatives for the Boxed Shapes product in the United States, the company said. Kraft also said it is replacing synthetic colors with those derived from natural sources, like paprika, annatto and turmeric. Heather White, executive director of the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization for health and environmental issues, applauded Kraft’s move and said it should be an example for other companies. “The announcement from Kraft should be a wake-up call for other food manufacturers to take notice, go back to the drawing board, reformulate and get rid of these synthetic ingredients of concern, especially in food that is marketed to children,” White said. Kraft Foods is one of North America’s largest consumer packaged food and beverage companies, with annual revenues of more than $18 billion. Its brands include Capri Sun, Jell-O, Kool-Aid, Lunchables, Maxwell House and Oscar Mayer. Kraft shares were up about 1 percent at $87.58 on Monday.

150,MDLZ,"Kraft Foods quarterly profit falls 16 percent, but tops expectations","(Reuters) - Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O, which is merging with ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co [HJHC.UL], on Tuesday reported profit that topped analyst estimates, driven by reduced advertising spending and overhead.  But the company missed revenue expectations amid sluggish demand for its meals and desserts. Kraft, whose brands include Velveeta and Oscar Mayer, is struggling to grow as consumers shift to brands that are perceived as healthier, including foods that are organic or less processed. Shares fell 16 cents to $85.72 in after-hours trading on Wednesday.  “It may not matter to the stock, but the quarter wasn’t great,” said JP Morgan analyst Ken Goldman in a note. “We did not see much ... that we think will send the shares higher tomorrow.”  Kraft’s net income fell 16 percent to $429 million, or 72 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 28, from $513 million, or 85 cents per share, a year earlier. When adjusted for items such as cost cuts and a loss related to the company’s pension obligations and other retirement benefits, Kraft earned 86 cents a share. Revenue fell slightly to $4.35 billion. Analysts had expected earnings per share of 81 cents and revenue of $4.43 billion.  Heinz, backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital, will combine with Kraft to create the third-largest North American food company, the companies said in late March. Both companies said at the time that the deal, which is expected to close in the second half of 2015, would provide an opportunity to expand Kraft’s brands overseas. Kraft says its brands are currently in 98 percent of North American households.  In the first quarter, the company said its cheese business, which rose 1.3 percent, benefited from price hikes in the past year and changes the company made to its Philadelphia brand soft cream cheese.  Meanwhile, beverage sales were up 4.2 percent, helped by the launch of McCafe branded coffee that Kraft is selling in partnership with McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N).

151,MDLZ,"UPDATE 3-Mondelez beat profit estimates, increases margins","(Adds context and CEO quote) By Anjali Athavaley and and Sruthi Ramakrishnan April 29 (Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc  reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit helped by cost cutting and price increases, as the maker of Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies seeks to boost margins amid slow growth in demand for packaged foods. Mondelez has focused on cutting costs with measures such as factory closures and zero-based budgeting, which requires managers to justify every cost in each new period. In the first quarter, Mondelez’s operating margin and gross profit margin rose to 10.4 percent and 37.9 percent, respectively, from the year-earlier period. The company’s shares were up 5 percent at $38.69 in midday trading. “The stock is indicating up, and we think this is the correct reaction,” said JP Morgan analyst Ken Goldman in a note. “The company’s plan to drive margin growth via supply chain and overhead savings seems to be on track.” Still, the company has grappled in recent quarters with volatility in some markets. Sales in Europe, where it raised prices to cover higher cocoa costs and faced weak demand, fell for the third straight quarter, down 16.4 percent to $2.98 billion. The company’s sales in North America were weak, rising just 0.9 percent to $1.68 billion, as a result of a strategy by Wal-Mart Stores Inc to reduce in-store displays and give store managers more control over merchandise space. Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld said on a conference call with investors that she expected “the opportunity to revisit some of those decisions, and particularly in our categories, which are highly impulse driven.” Net income rose to $312 million, or 19 cents per share, from $150 million, or 9 cents per share. Excluding items, the company earned 41 cents per share, beating the average analyst forecast of 37 cents. Total revenue fell 10.2 percent to $7.76 billion in the three months ended March 31, the sharpest drop in six quarters. That still beat the average analyst estimate of $7.72 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Selling and general expenses fell 15 percent to $1.9 billion. Mondelez said it expected the strong dollar to reduce 2015 net revenue growth by about 12 percentage points and adjusted earnings by about 34 cents per share. The company previously said the effects of foreign exchange translation would reduce net revenue growth by about 11 percentage points and adjusted earnings by about 30 cents per share.

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission  opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90  additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working  days.

156,MDLZ,Fitch Affirms Mondelez's IDRs at 'BBB/F2'; Outlook Negative,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the long-term Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) for Mondelez International, Inc. (Mondelez) at 'BBB' and removed it  from Rating Watch Negative.  Fitch has also affirmed the short-term IDR at 'F2'.  The Rating Outlook is Negative. A full list of ratings affirmed follows at the  end of this release. The removal from Rating Watch indicates Fitch's view that Mondelez's coffee  joint venture with D.E Master Blenders 1753 B.V. (DEMB) to form Jacobs Douwe  Egberts (JDE) is likely to close in the next few months, subject to remaining  closing conditions. The deal has been approved by the European Commission,  conditional on Mondelez and DEMB selling certain brands in order to address  concerns about higher pricing. Fitch anticipates that the JDE JV will sell  Mondelez's Carte Noire business in the European Economic Area, so Mondelez's  total anticipated JV proceeds of approximately EUR4 billion (with a locked-in  dollar rate of $1.37 for a total value of $5.5 billion) will remain unchanged.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Potentially Heightened Leverage through 2016: The ratings affirmation factors in  Fitch's expectations that Mondelez is likely to operate at a gross leverage  (total debt-to-EBITDA) range around 3.4x to 3.5x through 2016 as the company  exits its coffee business, executes share repurchases, and incurs peak cash  restructuring charges. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 3.3x, EBITDA-to-interest expense  was 7.7x and FFO adjusted leverage was 4.9x for the latest 12 months ended March  31, 2015.   The Negative Outlook reflects the risk that Mondelez deploys most of the JV  proceeds towards share repurchases, which, combined with the potential that  operating improvement is lower than Fitch's expectations for about 100bps  adjusted operating margin improvement in 2015, could lead to leverage in the  high 3x range. Mondelez already completed $1.5 billion in debt-financed share  repurchases in the first quarter of 2015 (1Q15) which contributed to a $2  billion increase in debt to $18.7 billion from $16.7 billion at the end of 2014.  Fitch is currently contemplating approximately $4.5 billion to $5 billion in  total share buybacks in 2015 within its 3.4x-3.5x leverage projection.   While Fitch anticipates that Mondelez can achieve the bulk of its $1.5 billion  annualized cost savings targeted by 2018 which should help replace the coffee  EBITDA over time, savings are likely to be skewed to the outer years and may be  reinvested in the business or returned to shareholders. Cash restructuring costs  over this period are expected to total $2.5 billion. Fitch assumes around $1  billion cash restructuring costs in 2015 and $800 million in 2016.  Fitch  expects heightened cash costs combined with elevated capex (projected at $1.8  billion in 2015 and 5% of sales thereafter) to result in negative free cash flow  (FCF) in 2015 and modestly positive FCF in 2016.   Fitch estimates Mondelez's coffee business generates EBITDA of approximately  $600 million to $700 million annually based on margins in the high teens.  Mondelez will hold a 49% equity interest in JDE, which will be the world's  leading pure-play coffee company with annual revenues exceeding EUR5 billion  (USD5.7 billion). Per the Shareholders' Agreement JDE will distribute the  following dividends to Mondelez and Acorn Holdings B.V., parent of DEMB: At  least EUR175 million (pro-rated for the first year), at least EUR200 million for  the second year, at least EUR225 million for the third year and 40% of operating  profit thereafter.  Scale and Diverse Geographies: Mondelez's ratings incorporate its scale as one  of the largest global packaged food companies with approximately $30 billion pro  forma 2014 net revenue after $3.8 billion estimated revenue contribution to JDE.  The company is well balanced geographically with 38% of 2014 net revenue in  higher growth potential emerging markets and 62% in mature developed markets.  Mondelez has substantial scale with No. 1 global market share in biscuits,  chocolate and candy as well as No. 2 global share in gum. After the coffee  business moves to the JV, the company's revenue from snacks will increase from  75% to 84%, leaving the portfolio slightly better positioned.   Near-Term Top Line Weakness: Mondelez is experiencing a broad-based global  macroeconomic slowdown in its categories.  In 2014, the company's organic  (price/volume/mix) top line in core snacks was only 1.6% and total organic net  revenue growth was 2.4%. Global growth in snacks (biscuits, chocolate, gum and  candy) per Nielsen Global Data fell below 4% in 2014 from approximately 6% in  2011 and 2012. Fitch believes near-term total organic top line growth will be in  the low single digits, and reported top line currently has a significant  currency headwind in 2015 of roughly 12%. If Mondelez continues to lead on  higher pricing, volumes could be negatively impacted and put even more pressure  on organic growth. Over the long term, Mondelez targets organic net revenue  growth at or above industry category growth, and adjusted operating income  growth in the high single digits. Fitch estimates top line growth could be  slower than this through the intermediate term, or about 3% annually in Fitch's  base case, in 2016 onward.  Strong Liquidity: Mondelez's liquidity at March 31, 2015, includes $1.8 billion  cash and equivalents and an undrawn $4.5 billion five-year senior unsecured  revolving credit facility expiring in October 2018. Mondelez had $3.5 billion CP  borrowings at quarter end. Upcoming long-term debt maturities are significant  and include EUR400 million (almost $500 million) due in June 2015, as well as  $1.8 billion due in 2016 and $1.5 billion due in 2017. Fitch believes the  company is likely to refinance 2016 and 2017 maturities.     KEY ASSUMPTIONS --2015 organic top line grows about 1.5%, which reflects about a 1% reduction  due to strategic decisions to improve revenue mix and exit low-margin  businesses; reported top line heavily affected by negative currency impact  currently estimated at about 12%; This year (2015) excludes a half year of the  coffee business, or about $1.9 billion revenue; top line organic growth of 2% to  3% thereafter.   --2015 EBITDA excludes a half year of coffee business, or about $325 million. --Total share buybacks of $4.5 billion to $5 billion in 2015.  --Cash restructuring charges of $1 billion in 2015 and $800 million in 2016.  --Capex at $1.8 billion in 2015 and 5% of revenue thereafter. --FCF negative in 2015 and modestly positive in 2016. --Total year-end debt estimated at $17 billion in 2015 and $18 billion in 2016.  --Total debt-to-EBITDA in the 3.4x to 3.5x range in 2015 and 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: -- If EBITDA tracks below expectation  due to a shortfall in expected operating  margin improvement or further deceleration in organic top line growth, or  financial policies are aggressive, such as not reducing debt materially from  $18.7 billion at March 31, 2015 after receiving proceeds from the coffee JV, or  the company engages in a large debt-financed acquisition, such that leverage is  likely to be consistently above 3.5x.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include: -- The Outlook is likely to be revised to Stable if Mondelez sustains organic  growth in the low single-digit range; makes substantial progress toward its  stated margin improvement which would take EBITDA to or above 2014 levels (with  coffee) of $5.6 billion and EBITDA margin in the 19% to 20% range, with the  company comfortably maintaining leverage in the 3.0-3.5x range by balancing  shareholder and debtholder interests.   --Over the long term, leverage consistently in the mid- to high-2x range and FCF  above $1 billion annually could support a positive rating action; however, this  is not anticipated in the near- to intermediate-term.   Fitch affirms Mondelez's ratings as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB'; --Credit facility at 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'.

157,MDLZ,MOVES-Amoye joins Ecom as global trading director from Mondelez,"NEW YORK, June 1 (Reuters) - Scott Amoye, who ran Mondelez International Inc’s cocoa business for five years, has joined Ecom in London, where the Switzerland-based commodity trader houses its cocoa and sugar trading operations, a spokesman confirmed to Reuters on Monday. Amoye left Mondelez, one of the world’s largest chocolate companies and the maker of Cadbury chocolates and Oreo cookies, at the end of February, and joined Ecom Agrotrade Ltd as global trading director on April 7. The move comes a year after Ecom, the 160-year-old family-owned commodity merchant, scooped up the loss-making physical trading arm of Armajaro Trading Ltd, expanding its footprint in the global high-risk coffee and cocoa markets. Ecom says it is one of the world’s top five cocoa merchants and says it handles 250,000 tonnes of cocoa in 2011, or roughly 6 percent of total world production of 4.2 million tonnes in the 2010/11 crop year, according to data from the World Cocoa Foundation. Amoye declined to comment and the spokesman did not immediately provide additional details on his responsibilities at Ecom. The move comes as competition among merchants and bean processors is intensifying after a series of deal making.

158,MDLZ,Kraft seeks dismissal of two counts in wheat price manipulation case,"(Reuters) - Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O and Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) petitioned a judge to dismiss two counts in a case filed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission that alleged the companies manipulated wheat prices. The CFTC in April accused Kraft Foods and Mondelez of making massive bets in Chicago’s futures markets in late 2011 as part of a plot to drive down the physical price of wheat they used in products such as Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers. The CFTC said the companies had violated speculative position limits and engaged in numerous noncompetitive trades in wheat. Kraft made reasonable business decisions to maintain a steady wheat supply in the face of a “dysfunctional” wheat market where cash prices bore little relation to those on the futures market, the companies said in a court filing on Monday. The company’s actions in 2011 “tell a straightforward story of a snack-food company doing the best it could to purchase wheat at sound prices in a difficult market,” they said. Kraft spun off its snacks business into Mondelez in 2012.     CFTC’s complaint focused primarily on trading that occurred before the split. The companies sought dismissal of the two counts saying CFTC’s allegation that wheat prices changed as a result of Kraft’s transactions was insufficient to infer it deceived or manipulated the market. Also, Kraft’s attempt to obtain the best wheat price necessarily means it lacked the “ability” or “intent” to create an “artificial price,” the companies said in the filing.

160,MDLZ,Italy's Lavazza to buy D.E. Master Blenders' coffee brand Merrild,"MILAN, June 12 (Reuters) - Italy’s Lavazza has reached agreement to buy a Danish coffee brand from D.E. Master Blenders, the Dutch group which is seeking to comply with conditions set by the European competition authorities for approving its merger with Mondelez’s coffee business. For the merger to be cleared Mondelez must also sell French brand Carte Noire. Lavazza in April said it was in contention to buy Carte Noire. It declined to say whether that was still the case after the Danish acquisition “Lavazza has agreed in terms with D.E. Master Blenders 1753 BV to meet the conditions of the European Commission regarding divestment of the Merrild brand,” the Italian coffee group said on Friday in a statement sent to Reuters. Closing of the deal is subject to the Commission’s approval, it said. Lavazza did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. Denmark’s Merrild, which generates more than 90 percent of its revenues through its roast and ground businesses, recorded net sales of around 35 million euros ($39 million) last year. Last month, the EC approved the merger of Mondelez’s coffee business with D.E. Master Blenders (DEMB) to create the world’s biggest standalone coffee company, Jacobs Douwe Egberts, on condition they sell certain businesses first.

161,MDLZ,Rough market could prompt Kraft Heinz rejig,"LONDON, June 19 (IFR) - HJ Heinz and Kraft Foods could be forced to rethink the currency composition of a jumbo bond financing as a combination of time pressure, rates and Greek volatility narrows its options. The companies, which will be rebranded Kraft Heinz Foods Company once they complete a US$46bn merger in early July, conclude European investor meetings on Monday June 22 for a potential US$11bn bond financing. However, plans to access a wide range of currencies from euros to sterling could be scuppered if the market backdrop - which has deteriorated over the last week as a result of the Greek deadlock - does not improve. “Kraft Heinz will happen next week; the question mark is on the composition of the currency mix,” said a source familiar with the deal. “The dollar market is in great shape and they could do the whole lot there although if there is some stability, the company will want to have some debt in euros and sterling given that it is global. They will use flexibility to their advantage.” Cheese giant Kraft and ketchup maker Heinz have only weeks before they seal the merger. While the US market looks to be restarting, after a US$5bn six-tranche benchmark for new pharma spin-off Baxalta attracted a book of around US$20bn this week, Europe only saw a 1.1bn dual-tranche investment grade corporate deal price. According to the investor presentation, the companies are planning to refinance the majority of the existing Heinz secured high yield debt and replace Kraft’s June 2015 maturities with new investment grade debt before the deal closes. Kraft Heinz is expected to be rated Baa3/BBB- by Moody’s/S&P.; Barclays and JP Morgan are global coordinators for the investor meetings. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also involved in the European meetings, and Citigroup and Wells Fargo in the US part. Torrid European market conditions have stalled potential new supply from around 20 corporate borrowers in recent weeks, and issuers have either had to accept the chunky premiums required or choose to wait it out until the summer-end. “There’s a lot of planes circling the runway, but everyone is holding off because they don’t want to be the ones paying a 30bp concession,” one European DCM official said. Only Gecina and Archer Daniels-Midlands have braved the euro market in the last two weeks, paying concessions of around 25bp and 30bp respectively. “Someone needs to get it going again and maybe Kraft could be the one, especially as it’s a bigger deal. If they do this well it could be the deal to kick-start the market,” the DCM official said. However, not all investors are sold on the prospect of new Kraft Heinz debt. “They are replacing senior secured notes with unsecured notes on the back of a credit watch for possible downgrade, and an increase in overall debt levels. But no doubt the market will focus on the impressive underlying cash flow and less on the deal structure,” one hedge fund manager said. Meanwhile, investors hope that the build-up of cash in the coming months will get put to work. “There are around 170bn of bonds, based on the Barclays European Corporate bond market index, that should mature this year,” Andreas Michalitsianos, portfolio manager for JPM Sterling Corporate Bond Fund said. However, supply has been historically high this year in the corporate market, and inflows from retail funds in particular have turned to outflows, investors say. “It will take some stability in the markets for participants to want to put their cash to work given a fear of further volatility and the risk that retail outflows will accelerate. New issues will need to come with an attractive premium to secondary spreads,” Michalitsianos added.

162,MDLZ,UPDATE 2-Ferrero to buy UK chocolate maker Thorntons for $178 mln,"* Thorntons board to back 112 mln stg Ferrero offer * Ferrero to examine cost savings once deal completed * Thorntons shares jump over 40 percent to bid price   (Adds analysts, details, background, shares) By Esha Vaish and Giancarlo Navach June 22 (Reuters) - The Italian firm behind Ferrero Rocher chocolates and Nutella spread has agreed to buy British chocolate retailer Thorntons for 112 million pounds ($177 million), striking a rare deal to expand in Europe’s biggest confectionery market. The deal is the first by family-owned Ferrero International since the death earlier this year of patriarch Michele Ferrero, who was Italy’s wealthiest man and largely shied away from acquisitions as he built up a business that also spans Kinder Surprise eggs and Tic Tac mints. Ferrero said on Monday it would pay 145 pence a share in cash for the 104-year-old Thorntons, a 43 percent premium to the British firm’s closing stock price on Friday. Thorntons’ management said it backed the deal. Thorntons has been hit in recent years by the rise of newer and upmarket brands such as Green & Black’s and Hotel Chocolate. It has had some success by shifting to sell more of its chocolates through third parties while closing some of its own stores, but after a profit warning in December its chief executive of four years, Jonathan Hart, is stepping down. “It’s good timing,” said N+1 Singer Capital Markets analyst Matthew McEachran of Ferrero’s offer, adding it appeared to be pitched at a fair value for shareholders. Thorntons shares, which had lost around 40 percent since March 2014, jumped to touch the offer price. Analysts said Thorntons was a good fit for Ferrero, which has strong, premium brands but no retail platform to showcase them. “The Thorntons store network will provide the company the opportunity to add a more directly experiential approach to its strategy,” said Euromonitor International’s Lamine Lahouasnia. “If all goes well with absorption of Thorntons stores in the UK, we could see similar happenings around the world in years to come.” According to Euromonitor, Britain is the world’s third-biggest confectionery market behind China and industry leader, the United States. Ferrero, which traces its roots back almost 60 years, said it would review Thorntons to identify potential cost savings, but ruled out closing the British firm’s Alfreton factory in central England. It will also keep the Thorntons brand. The death of its patriarch had sparked speculation Ferrero might be a takeover target for rivals such as Mars, Mondelez International, Nestle or Hershey. Michele Ferrero had stayed out of the dealmaking that has gripped the consumer goods industry in recent years. He vetoed the idea of a bid for Cadbury in 2009, another British chocolate maker which was ultimately taken over by Mondelez, according to sources familiar with the company. His only acquisition was a Turkish hazelnut factory in 2014, aimed at securing supply of the ingredient precious to his Nutella.

164,MDLZ,Mondelez in talks with multiple parties to sell Carte Noire,"(Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) said it was in talks with multiple parties for the sale of French coffee brand Carte Noire to address European antitrust concerns as it closed a deal with D.E Master Blenders DEMBF.PK to create the world’s biggest standalone coffee company. The European Commission approved the Jacobs Douwe Egberts joint venture in May on a condition that Mondelez must sell its Carte Noire business and DEMB sell its Merrild business across the European Economic Area. Italian coffee company Lavazza, which had exclusive rights to buy Carte Noire, agreed last month to buy DEMB’s Merrild instead.  Lavazza could drop the ball on Carte Noire, said to be valued around 1 billion euros, a source told Reuters last week.  Mondelez spokeswoman Valerie Moens said Mondelez was no longer in exclusive discussions with Lavazza.    Mondelez said its entire French coffee portfolio except Carte Noire was part of the Netherlands-based joint venture. The French business was not part of the original agreement, though DEMB’s parent Acorn Holdings B.V. had made a binding offer for that business. The company put up Carte Noire for sale after its offer to sell two of its other French brands - L’Or and Grand Mere - to Lavazza failed to soothe competition concerns. Following the close of the deal with DEMB, Mondelez received 3.8 billion euros ($4.21 billion) in cash and a 44 percent interest in the joint venture. Acorn Holdings will own the rest, the companies said. The cash and equity paid to Mondelez was reduced from the previous estimate of 4 billion euros and a 49 percent stake as the company retained its interest in a Korea-based joint venture, Dongsuh Foods Corp.

Procter & Gamble fell 3.7 percent after the company reported its sixth straight quarter of lower sales while Facebook shares fell 2.6 percent after the social media company’s profit decreased. Mondelez International rose 4.9 percent to $45.22 after reporting results that beat expectations. Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter, while first-quarter numbers were revised to show that the economy, previously reported to have shrunk,  grew at 0.6 percent. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said the economy was improving and left doors open for a possible rate hike in September. The Fed has maintained near-zero interest rates for nearly a decade, saying it will raise rates only when it sees a sustained recovery in the economy. “Earnings haven’t been great and there is much more slack in the economy than the market or the Fed thought while big concerns such as oil and China continue to persist,” said John Canally, investment strategist at LPL Financial. “We are in a slow-growth environment and anything that knocks that down further is not a plus for the market.” The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen and was up 0.75 percent near a weekly high of $97.70 against a basket of currencies as the Fed readies to raise rates this year. U.S. stocks closed stronger on Wednesday after the Fed statement. The S&P; 500 has bounced about 2 percent higher in the past two days following a near-3 percent drop over the preceding week that had been caused in part by a rout in China’s stock markets. At 13:15 p.m. ET (1715 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was up 3.37 points, or 0.02 percent, at 17,754.76, the S&P; 500 was down 0.09 points, or -0 percent, at 2,108.48 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 19.57 points, or 0.38 percent, at 5,131.31. Five of the 10 major S&P; sectors were lower with the energy index’s 0.6 percent fall leading the decliners. More than halfway through the second-quarter earnings season, analysts expect overall earnings of S&P; 500 companies to edge up 0.8 percent and revenue to decline 3.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. While earnings are expected to increase this quarter, valuations remain a concern. The S&P; 500 is trading near 16.9 times forward 12-month earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data. Companies scheduled to report during the day include Expedia, LinkedIn and Western Union  after the close. Whole Foods Market slumped 12 percent to $35.89 after same-store sales growth cooled. Skechers USA jumped 15.1 percent to $147.89 as the sports shoe maker and retailer reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly revenue. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,495 to 1,446. On the Nasdaq, 1,393 issues rose and 1,300 fell.

167,MDLZ,"Mondelez profit beats on lower costs, boosts buyback","(Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), the maker of Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by lower costs and raised its share buyback plan by $6 billion. The company’s shares touched a record high of $45.22 on Thursday, after it also raised its full-year revenue growth forecast. Mondelez said it expects organic net revenue to grow at least 3 percent for the year, up 1 percent from its prior forecast, boosted by price increases and higher spending on advertising. The company will spend more to promote its products in markets such as Europe and India, where demand has been hit after it raised chocolate prices last year, Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld said on a conference call with analysts. Higher cocoa and dairy prices forced the company to raise the price of its chocolates and coffee in some markets, leading to a backlash from some retailers and customers. The company is trying to woo customers in India by offering them more chocolate pack sizes at different price points, while price gaps with competing brands in Europe are narrowing as rivals have also been forced to raise prices, Rosenfeld added. Sales in Europe, Mondelez’s biggest market, fell 16.7 percent to $2.82 billion in the second quarter ended June 30 from a year earlier. Mondelez also said it would stop including results from its coffee operations from its next quarterly report. The business was spun off into a joint venture with Dutch group D.E Master Blenders to create the world’s biggest standalone coffee company this month. Mondelez said its buyback plan, under which it would now buy $13.7 billion of shares, would expire on Dec. 31, 2018. Excluding items, the company earned 47 cents per share in the second quarter, handily beating the average analyst estimate of 39 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Mondelez has taken several measures to cut costs, including shutting factories and “zero-based budgeting,” which requires managers to justify every expense in each new budgeting period. Net income attributable to the company fell 35 percent to $406 million, or 25 cents per share, in the quarter. Net revenue fell for the seventh straight quarter to $7.66 billion, down 9.2 percent from a year earlier, but beat the average estimate of $7.49 billion. Organic net revenue, however, rose 4.3 percent, helped by the price increases.

169,MDLZ,Investor Ackman takes $5.5 billion stake in Cadbury owner Mondelez,"(Reuters) - Activist investor William Ackman has built a stake worth about $5.5 billion in Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), the maker of Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies, in what is seen as an attempt to push the company to boost earnings or sell itself. Mondelez has already taken steps to boost its operational performance, including shutting factories and shedding businesses. The company has also set a share buyback of up to $13.7 billion. But analysts said Ackman probably wants more. “We suspect Mr Ackman’s primary goal is to have Mondelēz sold,” JP Morgan analyst Ken Goldman wrote in a note. A slowdown in growth for the global packaged food industry has sparked a wave of consolidation as companies try to cut costs, boost efficiency and gain scale. However, Mondelez’s shares - which initially jumped on news that Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital would become the company’s biggest shareholder - were up less than 1 percent in early trading amid doubts about whether a buyer could be found. At the current share price of around $46.40, Mondelez is valued at about $80 billion. Some analysts mentioned newly formed Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) or PepsiCo Inc PEP.N as potential buyers. J.P. Morgan’s Goldman, though, said Kraft Heinz backer 3G Capital might be reluctant to make another acquisition so soon after its $46 billion deal to combine Kraft and Heinz. And with Mondelez trading at 18 times EBITDA, PepsiCo would also find it “challenging” to buy Mondelez, he said. Kraft Heinz and PepsiCo representatives declined to comment.

(1.usa.gov/1IZiKJb) Ackman, one of America’s most successful investors, joins fellow activist Nelson Peltz as an investor in Mondelez, which reported its seventh straight drop in quarterly revenue last week.

The S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq composite rose on Wednesday following three days of losses as tech shares advanced, while the blue-chip Dow index ticked lower, weighed by Walt Disney’s  largest daily drop in almost seven years. U.S. economic data released in the last few days have been largely mixed, prompting some investors to argue that the Fed might hold off rate hikes until December. The Fed has said it will raise rates only when it sees a sustained recovery in the economy. A hike in rates, which have stayed near zero for nearly a decade, will increase borrowing costs for companies, crimping profits. “I’ve been leaning towards September because while the data has been mixed, none of it has been really bad,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. “I think a hike is good for the market because we can finally stop worrying about it, and historically the Fed has always been slow regarding subsequent increases.” Data released on Thursday showed that the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits rose less than expected last week, indicating tighter labor market conditions. S&P; 500 e-minis were up 1.25 points, or 0.06 percent, with 100,921 contracts traded at 8:38 a.m. ET. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 5.75 points, or 0.13 percent, on volume of 19,391 contracts while Dow e-minis were up 8 points, or 0.05 percent, with 11,883 contracts changing hands. Marathon Oil, Monster Beverage and Zynga  are among the companies scheduled to report after the close of market. With about three-quarters of the S&P; 500 companies having reported, second-quarter earnings are estimated to have increased 1.3 percent while revenues are projected to have  fallen 3.5 percent. Mondelez International shares rose 6.9 percent to $49.42 in premarket trading after billionaire activist investor William Ackman’s hedge fund said it has built a stake worth about $5.5 billion in the Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies maker. Michael Kors Holdings rose 6.1 percent to $41.89 after its results beat expectations. Tesla Motors fell 6.2 percent to $253.34 after the electric car maker posted a wider quarterly loss. Keurig Green Mountain slumped 30 percent to $52.76, a day after the company lowered its annual sales and earnings-per-share forecasts.

At the current share price of around $46.40, Mondelez is valued at about $80 billion. Some analysts mentioned newly formed Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) or PepsiCo Inc PEP.N as potential buyers. J.P. Morgan’s Goldman, though, said Kraft Heinz backer 3G Capital might be reluctant to make another acquisition so soon after its $46 billion deal to combine Kraft and Heinz. And with Mondelez trading at 18 times EBITDA, PepsiCo would also find it “challenging” to buy Mondelez, he said. Kraft Heinz and PepsiCo representatives declined to comment. Pershing Square gave no hint of its intentions on Thursday, saying only in a filing that it believed Mondelez's shares were undervalued. (1.usa.gov/1IZiKJb) Ackman, one of America’s most successful investors, joins fellow activist Nelson Peltz as an investor in Mondelez, which reported its seventh straight drop in quarterly revenue last week. Largely at Peltz’s urging, Mondelez is in the midst of a plan to cut about $3.5 billion in costs by the end of 2018 and has set a target of an adjusted operating margin of 15-16 percent in 2016. That compares with 12 percent in 2012, before Peltz took stakes in Mondelez and PepsiCo and agitated for them to merge - a demand he dropped after he gained a seat on Mondelez’s board. Mondelez recently separated its coffee business into a joint venture now called Jacobs Douwe Egberts. That move has freed up Mondelez’s management to focus on its snacks business. There has also been speculation that Mondelez will sell its European cheese and grocery business after it separated the unit last year into a standalone unit. Pershing Square said on Wednesday it held a 7.5 percent stake in Deerfield, Illinois-based Mondelez, including forward purchase contracts and call options. Peltz’s Trian Fund Management holds 3 percent of Mondelez, according to Thomson Reuters data. Peltz, who said in April he was not pushing Mondelez to do a big deal, was quoted by CNBC as saying he was pleased Ackman sees value in Mondelez. Reuters could not reach him for comment. Peltz played a role in the breakup of Kraft into Kraft Foods Group and Mondelez.         Up to Wednesday’s close, Mondelez shares had risen 27.4 percent this year.

174,MDLZ,Billionaire Ackman eyeing Mondelez reunion with Kraft: sources,"BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman’s success at Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) may depend largely on a calculation that nimbler rival Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) will soon snap up the maker of Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies, sources familiar with Ackman’s approach said. Ackman’s $20 billion hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management disclosed late Wednesday it spent $5.5 billion for a 7.5 percent stake in snack company Mondelez, making this the firm’s biggest-ever bet. It is the second time around for the activist investor and Mondelez. Pershing Square briefly owned the company in 2013 after its split from Kraft in 2012. Investors and analysts agree there are several routes to higher returns. Costs could be cut further or the board may want to find a new chief executive to replace Irene Rosenfeld, 62. But the most likely path could be a scenario where Kraft Heinz, created earlier this year, reunites with its former unit, the sources familiar with matter said. The foods sector has already seen a raft of takeovers but a bid for Mondelez, with a market capitalization of $74.6 billion, could be another megadeal in the space. Analysts and investors familiar with Ackman’s approach agree that the hedge fund mogul may have his sights on a merger strategy and Wall Street has been rife with speculation that Kraft Heinz would be a logical choice. But analysts also note there is work to be done integrating Kraft and Heinz still and that Kraft Heinz would be preoccupied for now.  Mondelez’s shares - which initially jumped on news that Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital would become the company’s biggest shareholder - closed up just over 1 percent on Thursday at $46.81 amid doubts about whether a buyer could be found.  “We do not think a possible KHC/MDLZ merger is out of the question entirely, especially a couple of years from now,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a research note. “But near term we have questions about such a deal.”  While Ackman prides himself on being a long-term investor who has been called patient, some people have said there are signs that he might be pushing for a quicker pace on making changes with this investment. Kraft Heinz and Mondelez were once the same company and already know each other well, suggesting that due diligence for a possible acquisition may not take as long. Plus interest rates are still low, meaning that a suitor could finance a takeover more cheaply now than later when the Federal Reserve prepares for a hike probably later this year. It would also mean that Mondelez’ stock price might still be lower, making for a cheaper bid, than two years down the line when the price would presumably be higher. Much of the speculation of who may put in a bid for Mondelez revolves around 3G Capital, the Brazilian private investment group that teamed up with Warren Buffett to create Kraft Heinz. Ackman has worked with 3G on a deal to take Burger King public and Buffett, the octogenarian investor, has suggested that he wants to do a few more deals during his career. This might suggest there is an opportunity to join forces sooner rather than later, the sources said.

Heinz, backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc  and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital, combined with Kraft earlier this year to create the third-largest North American food company. The combined company expects to save about $1.5 billion in annual costs by the end of 2017.

177,MDLZ,"Mondelez to boost ad spending, healthier offerings","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Snack maker Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) will spend more on advertising its brands, increase healthier offerings and expand its e-commerce business to boost sales as consumers eat less processed food, an executive overseeing the company’s growth strategy said.  Mark Clouse, Mondelez’s chief growth officer, said in an interview that the company plans to increase its advertising spending to 10 percent of revenue by 2018, up from 8 percent last year. The maker of Oreo cookies, Cadbury chocolate and Triscuit crackers also aims for its e-commerce business to grow to $1 billion in 2020 from $100 million today.  Additionally, Clouse said that in the next five years, Mondelez hopes to generate half of its revenue from snacks perceived as healthier, up from a third currently. This includes individually wrapped snacks that are 200 calories or less and products that have nutritional attributes, such as fewer ingredients and no artificial flavors.  “If you look at where consumers are going, we have to better position the portfolio to fully unlock the potential for growth,” Clouse said. Since it became a stand-alone company in 2012, Mondelez has mostly focused on improving its profit margins through reducing its expenses. The company is in the midst of a plan to cut about $3 billion in costs by the end of 2018 through measures such as opening more efficient manufacturing plants and zero-based budgeting, which requires expenses to be justified for each new period. Until now, it hasn’t given many details on how it plans to invest those savings to achieve higher sales growth. Clouse said the approach involves changing existing products to suit consumer needs and moving into new markets and categories that offer growth potential. In February, Mondelez said it was buying Enjoy Life Foods, the maker of allergen free snacks, for an undisclosed amount.  The efforts come at a time when packaged food companies, faced with sluggish growth, are increasingly under pressure from investors to change their offerings and slash costs. In August, billionaire investor William Ackman’s hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management disclosed that it spent $5.5 billion for a 7.5 percent stake in Mondelez in what was seen by Wall Street as an attempt to push the company to increase its margins further or potentially sell itself. Investors and analysts have speculated that the company could combine with Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O).  Kraft and Mondelez used to be the same company until their split in 2012. Last March, Kraft said it was merging with ketchup-maker H.J. Heinz Co in a deal backed by 3G Capital, a Brazilian private equity firm known for cutting costs. Clouse said of 3G’s abilities that “there’s no doubt that those are our fundamental capabilities and skill sets that are really important in today’s world.” He added, “The key is, can you bring the same operational discipline and clarity to a growth agenda that allows you to sustain it over time. I think that’s really what we’re shooting for.”  ",9102015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mondelez-intl-outlook/mondelez-to-boost-ad-spending-healthier-offerings-idUSKCN0RA17J20150910
178,MDLZ,Pershing Square's Ackman tells CNBC Mondelez could be takeover target,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - William Ackman, head of hedge fund firm Pershing Square Capital Management, said on Friday that stocks were cheap at current levels and that Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) could be an acquisition target.  “I think stocks are pretty cheap,” Ackman told cable business channel CNBC, but he excluded energy stocks since he was not an investor in the sector.  He said he was “a little more bullish” on the stock market than fellow hedge fund manager David Tepper of Appaloosa Management. Tepper told CNBC on Thursday he could not call himself a bull on stocks for next year. On Mondelez, Ackman said: “Either the current team will get the business to its potential in reasonably rapid fashion, or it will be a target.” Ackman has built a stake worth about $5.5 billion in Mondelez, the maker of Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies. Ackman, who first announced a $1 billion short bet against Herbalife Ltd (HLF.N) and accused the company of being a pyramid scheme in 2012, said: “the last way we win here is just basic business deterioration.”  Herbalife has repeatedly denied Ackman’s claims.

A merged group would have a market value of around $275 billion at current prices, and would combine AB InBev’s dominance of Latin America with SABMiller’s of Africa, both fast-growing markets, as well as their breweries in Asia. “The real attraction is Africa, where AB InBev has no presence, as well as some add-ons in Asia and Latin America,” said Societe Generale analyst Andrew Holland. AB InBev and other top brewers are trying to move into new markets as they look to shrug off weakness in North America and Europe, where consumers increasingly choose craft beers made by independent players or wine or spirits. SABMiller, the world number two and maker of more than 200 beers including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, said on Wednesday it had been informed that AB InBev intended to make an offer which it would have to do by Oct. 14 under British rules. AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private equity fund run by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed its approach. 3G, known for its focus on cost cuts at the expense of marketing, has previously orchestrated takeovers of Burger King, ketchup maker Heinz and Kraft Foods. A source close to SAB said it was too early to say what it would do since no offer has been made. “At this stage, we’re in wait and see mode,” said the source. Speculation about a merger, likely to raise antitrust concerns in markets such as the United States and China, has swirled for years. The timing of the approach, after more than a decade of acquisitions by AB InBev, follows a roughly 15 percent drop in SABMiller’s share price since August. “It’s exactly the moment they’ve been waiting for,” said Morningstar analyst Phil Gorham. “It makes sense financially for the first time in years.” AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds ($62) per SAB Miller share, and maybe as much as 45 pounds, according to analysts - implying an overall price of up to $130 billion, including SABMiller’s debt. That would make it the biggest M&A; deal of 2015, already shaping up to be a record year since the 2008 financial crisis in terms of deal volume, and one the five largest takeovers since 1980. Shares in SAB closed up 19.9 percent at 36.14 pounds, giving it a market capitalization of $90 billion. AB InBev’s were up 6.4 percent. Rivals Heineken, Carlsberg and Diageo also rose on speculation SAB might seek another merger as a defence strategy, as it did last year when it offered to buy Heineken, but was rebuffed. Since then it has combined its African soft drink bottler with that of Coca-Cola, and in recent weeks there has been speculation about it combining with Diageo or Australian drinks firm Coca-Cola Amatil. The global beer market share of AB InBev, maker of Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, was 21.1 percent in 2014, while SABMiller’s was 15 percent, according to industry experts Plato Logic. Heineken is the No. 3. AB InBev’s target for its net debt to core profit (EBITDA) ratio is 2 times, from around 2.5 currently. It is likely to reach that by 2016, the earliest any deal could realistically be completed, and so has room to borrow to fund any takeover. When it bought Budweiser-maker Anheuser-Busch in 2008 for $52 billion, the largest cash takeover in history at the time, it let the ratio rise to beyond 5 times. Going that high again might allow it to raise as much as $100 billion in debt. AB InBev’s controlling families own just over half of the company, while SABMiller’s two top shareholders are cigarette maker Altria and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia. Altria on Wednesday declined comment on the AB InBev approach, but on Sept. 9, its CFO Billy Gifford said at an analyst conference that it regularly evaluates its SABMiller investment “and at this time we believe maintaining the asset is in our shareholders’ best interests.” The Santo Domingo family could not immediately be reached for comment. Neil Dwane, European chief investment officer, equity, at Allianz Global Investors, which holds shares in both companies, said AB InBev had faced increasing pressure to return excess cash to shareholders. “ABI is paying a high price but accretion to earnings from low debt costs would be something in the region of 15 percent. However, we think the return on this deal could be a relatively disappointing 8 percent after 10 years,” Dwane said. There are significant antitrust hurdles to any combination, particularly in the United States, where the companies would have about 70 percent of the beer market. “The costs that could be saved in the distribution operations are high - and the antitrust hurdles are higher,” said Erik Gordon, professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. A deal would allow Molson Coors to acquire the 58 percent of the joint venture owned by SABMiller according to the operating agreement that governs it. A change in control at SABMiller would automatically give Molson the right to acquire an additional 8 percent and name a new CEO at the venture. Denver-based Molson would also have the right of first and last offer for the remaining 50 percent stake. A Molson spokesman declined to comment on whether the company would be interested in a bid, but Molson shares surged more than 12 percent to an all-time high. Any merged group may also have to sell interests in China, where SABMiller’s CR Snow joint venture with China Resources  is the market leader. Heineken, Carlsberg or China’s Tsingtao could be potential buyers. Plato estimates that after disposals, the combined group could end up with a 28 percent global market share.

Notes 'BBB',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to  Mondelez International, Inc.'s (Mondelez) issuance of CHF400 million in senior  unsecured fixed-rate notes in two tranches: a 98.5- month  CHF265 million note  with a 1.125% coupon maturing on Dec. 21, 2023, and a 60-month CHF135 million  note with a 0.625% coupon maturing on Oct. 6, 2020. Closing is expected in  October and proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes including  refinancing upcoming maturities.  The notes will not be registered with the SEC; instead, they will be registered  for sale only in Switzerland and may be redeemed early at par and in full if  changes in tax laws or regulations result in additional payments such as  withholdings, duties or assessments. The customary change of control provision  at 101% of face value is in place. The Outlook is Negative.  A full list of ratings follows at the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Potentially Heightened Leverage through 2016: The affirmation factors in Fitch's  expectations that Mondelez is likely to operate at a gross leverage (total  debt-to-EBITDA) range around 3.4x to 3.5x through 2016 as the company exits its  coffee business, executes share repurchases, and incurs peak cash restructuring  charges. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 3.4x, EBITDA-to-interest expense was 8.7x and  FFO adjusted leverage was 5x for the latest 12 months ended June 30, 2015.  The Negative Outlook reflects the risk that heavy restructuring related cash  payments combined with share repurchases partially funded by debt could lead to  leverage in the high 3x range. Mondelez already completed more than $2.1 billion  in share repurchases in the first half of 2015 which contributed to a $2.6  billion increase in debt to $19.3 billion from $16.7 billion at the end of 2014.  While Fitch anticipates that Mondelez can achieve the bulk of its $1.5 billion  annualized cost savings targeted by 2018, which should help replace the coffee  EBITDA over time, savings are likely to be skewed to the outer years and may be  reinvested in the business or returned to shareholders. Cash restructuring costs  over this period are expected to total $2.5 billion. Fitch assumes around $1  billion cash restructuring costs in 2015 and $800 million in 2016. Fitch expects  heightened cash costs combined with elevated capex (projected at $1.8 billion in  2015 and 5% of sales thereafter) to result in negative free cash flow (FCF) in  2015 and modestly positive FCF in 2016.  Mondelez's coffee business, which is now reported on the balance sheet as assets  held for sale, generates EBITDA of approximately $600 million to $700 million  annually with margins in the high teens. Mondelez will hold a 43.5% equity  interest in JDE, which will be the world's leading pure-play coffee company,  with annual revenues exceeding EUR5 billion (USD5.7 billion). Per the  Shareholders' Agreement JDE will distribute the following dividends to Mondelez  and Acorn Holdings B.V., parent of DEMB: At least EUR175 million (pro-rated for  the first year), at least EUR200 million for the second year, at least EUR225  million for the third year, and 40% of operating profit thereafter.  Scale and Diverse Geographies: Mondelez's ratings incorporate its scale as one  of the largest global packaged food companies with approximately $30 billion pro  forma 2014 net revenue after $3.8 billion estimated revenue contribution to JDE.  The company is well-balanced geographically with 38% of 2014 net revenue in  higher-growth-potential emerging markets and 62% in mature developed markets.  Mondelez has substantial scale with No. 1 global market share in biscuits,  chocolate and candy as well as No. 2 global share in gum. After the coffee  business moves to the JV, the company's revenue from snacks will increase from  75% to 84%, leaving the portfolio slightly better positioned.  Near-Term Top-Line Weakness: Mondelez is experiencing a broad-based global  macroeconomic slowdown in its categories which is exacerbated by the currency  effects of a strong dollar. In 2014, the company's organic (price/volume/mix)  top line in core snacks was only 1.6% and total organic net revenue growth was  2.4%. Global growth in snacks (biscuits, chocolate, gum and candy) per Nielsen  Global Data fell below 4% in 2014 from approximately 6% in 2011 and 2012. Fitch  believes near-term total organic top-line growth will be in the low single  digits, and reported top line currently has a significant currency headwind in  2015 of roughly 12%. If Mondelez continues to lead on higher pricing, volumes  could be negatively impacted and put even more pressure on organic growth. Over  the long term, Mondelez targets organic net revenue growth at or above industry  category growth, and adjusted operating income growth in the high single digits.  Fitch estimates top-line growth could be slower than this through the  intermediate term, or about 3% annually in Fitch's base case, in 2016 onward.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS --2015 organic top line grows about 1.5%, which reflects about a 1% reduction  due to strategic decisions to improve revenue mix and exit low-margin  businesses; reported top line heavily affected by negative currency impact  currently estimated at about 12%. This year (2015) excludes a half year of the  coffee business, or about $1.9 billion revenue; top-line organic growth of 2% to  3% thereafter.  --2015 EBITDA excludes a half year of coffee business, or about $325 million. --Cash restructuring charges of $1 billion in 2015 and $800 million in 2016.  --Capex at $1.8 billion in 2015 and 5% of revenue thereafter. --FCF negative in 2015 and modestly positive in 2016. --Total year-end debt estimated at $17 billion in 2015 and $18 billion in 2016.  --Total debt-to-EBITDA in the 3.4x to 3.5x range in 2015 and 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: -- If EBITDA tracks below expectation due to a shortfall in expected operating  margin improvement or further deceleration in organic top-line growth, or  financial policies are aggressive, such as not reducing debt materially from  $19.3 billion at June 30, 2015 after receiving proceeds from the coffee JV, or  the company engages in a large debt-financed acquisition, such that leverage is  likely to be consistently above 3.5x.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include: --The Outlook is likely to be revised to Stable if Mondelez sustains organic  growth in the low single-digit range; makes substantial progress toward its  stated margin improvement which would take EBITDA to or above 2014 levels (with  coffee) of $5.6 billion and EBITDA margin in the 19% to 20% range, with the  company comfortably maintaining leverage in the 3.0-3.5x range by balancing  shareholder and debtholder interests.  --Over the long term, leverage consistently in the mid- to high-2x range and FCF  above $1 billion annually could support a positive rating action; however, this  is not anticipated in the near- to intermediate-term. LIQUIDITY Mondelez's liquidity at June 30, 2015, includes almost $2 billion in cash and  equivalents and an undrawn $4.5 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving  credit facility expiring in October 2018. Mondelez had $3.1 billion commercial  paper borrowings at quarter end. Upcoming long-term debt maturities are  significant with $1.8 billion due in 2016 and $1.5 billion due in 2017. Fitch  believes the company is likely to refinance 2016 and 2017 maturities and today's  actions at very low CHF rates are within expectations.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has the following ratings on Mondelez: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB';  --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB'; --Credit facility at 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.

184,MDLZ,Exclusive - Mondelez seeks European cheese and grocery asset sale: sources,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) is exploring a sale of its European cheese and grocery business, which could be valued at around $3 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, as it sharpens its focus on snack foods and refreshments.  Mondelez, the maker of Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies, has hired investment banks Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to seek buyers for the assets, the people said, cautioning that the divestment was not certain. The assets could appeal to companies such as Kraft Heinz, as well as private equity firms, the people added, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Kraft Heinz has right of first refusal for the assets as a result of its spinning off of Mondelez in 2012.  Mondelez, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Kraft Heinz declined to comment. Mondelez has separated its European cheese and grocery business from its coffee business, which was combined last year with that owned by D.E Master Blenders 1753.  The European cheese and grocery operations brought in net revenues of $1.44 billion in 2014, according to Mondelez’s latest annual report. In August, William Ackman revealed his activist hedge fund Pershing Square had built a stake worth about $5.5 billion in Mondelez International, in what is seen as an attempt to push the company to boost earnings or sell itself. Ackman joined fellow activist Nelson Peltz as an investor in Mondelez, which reported its seventh straight drop in quarterly revenue on July 30. Largely at Peltz’s urging, Mondelez is in the midst of a plan to cut about $3.5 billion in costs by the end of 2018 and has set a target of an adjusted operating margin of 15 percent to 16 percent in 2016. Mondelez has taken several measures to cut costs, including shutting factories and “zero-based budgeting,” which requires managers to justify every expense in each new budgeting period.

185,MDLZ,SEC prepares civil charges against Mondelez in Cadbury probe: WSJ,"(Reuters) - The Securities and Exchange Commission is preparing to file civil charges against Oreo cookies maker Mondelez International Inc in connection with a long-running investigation of payments its Cadbury unit made in India, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Mondelez is unlikely to face any criminal bribery charges under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act because no evidence has emerged connecting suspicious payments to the United States, the Journal said, citing one of these people. Prosecutors haven’t ruled out other charges, the newspaper quoted the person as saying.

The company didn’t disclose the findings to federal authorities, but a whistleblower provided it to the SEC and the U.S. Justice Department earlier this year, the Journal said, citing people close to the probe.

188,MDLZ,Oreo cookies maker Mondelez's results beats estimates,"(Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), the maker of Cadbury chocolates and Oreo cookies, reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue, helped by lower costs and higher organic sales in emerging markets. The company is in the midst of a plan to reduce costs by about $3 billion by the end of 2018 through measures such as opening more efficient manufacturing plants and zero-based budgeting. Mondelez’s total costs fell nearly 20 percent in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 compared with a year earlier.  Net income attributable to Mondelez was $7.26 billion, or $4.46 per share, including a $7.12 billion gain due to divestitures in its coffee business. The company earned $899 million, or 53 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned 42 cents per share in the latest quarter. Net revenue fell 18 percent to $6.85 billion, hurt by lower sales in Europe, its largest market. This was the eight straight quarter of sales declines. Mondelez said organic revenue increased 3.7 percent, helped by a 10.3 percent jump in sales in emerging markets such as Latin America and Asia-Pacific. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 41 cents on revenue of $6.81 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Mondelez’s shares closed at $46.60 on Tuesday.

196,MDLZ,Fitch Rates Mondelez's EUR700MM Senior Unsecured Notes 'BBB',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to  Mondelez International, Inc.'s (Mondelez) issuance of EUR700 million 1.625%  senior unsecured notes due 2023. Proceeds will be used for general corporate  purposes, including refinancing a $1.75 billion 4.125% note due on Feb. 9, 2016.  The customary change of control provision at 101% of face value is in place. The  Rating Outlook is Negative. KEY RATING DRIVERS The Negative Outlook reflects Fitch's expectations for pressure on free cash  flow (FCF) in the near term from heavy restructuring-related cash payments,  particularly in 2016, and low core growth as reflected in negative volumes and  lower-than-category growth rates in biscuits and chocolate year to date.  Biscuits and chocolate represent approximately 70% of Mondelez's post-coffee  profile. The company reported that volume trends have recently begun to improve.  Near-Term Top-Line Weakness: Mondelez is experiencing a broad-based global  macroeconomic slowdown in its categories exacerbated by the currency effects of  a strong dollar. Organic revenue growth has been in the 2% - 4% range over the  past three years. It rose to the top end in 2015 as the company took higher than  expected levels of pricing of around 6% - 7% with negative volume in the 2% - 3%  range as consumers reacted to sticker shock in weak emerging markets. FX had a  large negative impact on the top line, as with all multinational companies, with  -13% expected this year. High Medium-Term Leverage  Fitch expects that Mondelez will likely operate with gross leverage (total  debt-to-EBITDA) of around 3.4x to 3.5x through 2016 as it executes share  repurchases, and incurs peak cash restructuring charges. Total reported LTM  debt-to-EBITDA was 3x at the end of third quarter 2015 but that includes the  operating income of the more profitable coffee operations over the past several  quarters. The coffee operations were contributed to a new joint venture (Jacobs  Douwe Egberts; JDE) on July 2, 2015.  High Cash Outlays/Negative FCF in 2016 In 2014 the company announced a $3.5 billion restructuring program to be  executed from 2014 through 2018 with $2.5 billion in cash costs. The purpose is  to reduce supply chain and overhead costs by $1.5 billion by the end of 2018.  Fitch anticipates that Mondelez can achieve the bulk of its $1.5 billion in  annualized cost savings targeted by 2018, which should offset the loss of $600  million to $700 million in coffee EBITDA over time; however, savings are likely  to be skewed to the outer years.  The majority of program charges were expected to occur in 2015 and 2016 with  completion by year-end 2018. In addition, as with most restructurings there are  other implementation costs which are directly attributable to those programs but  do not qualify for special accounting treatment which can be meaningful. Since  inception the company has incurred $1 billion in charges including $710 million  in restructuring charges and $290 million in implementation expenses.  Fitch had previously assumed around $1 billion in cash restructuring costs in  2015 and $800 million in 2016 which would result in modest negative FCF in 2015  and modestly positive FCF in 2016. Year to date, cash paid towards the 2014 -  2018 program is $156 million. Given the current trajectory it appears that the  bulk of cash outlays related to the 2014 - 2018 program will occur in 2016.  Mondelez generates a significant portion of FCF in the fourth quarter, and with  muted spends thus far, FCF should be positive this year but moderately negative  in 2016.  Scale and Diverse Geographies: Mondelez's ratings incorporate its scale as one  of the largest global packaged food companies with approximately $30 billion pro  forma 2015 net revenue after $3.8 billion estimated revenue contribution to JDE.  The company is well-balanced geographically with 39% of 2014 net revenue in  higher-growth-potential emerging markets and 61% in mature developed markets.  Mondelez has substantial scale with No. 1 global market share in biscuits,  chocolate and candy as well as No. 2 global share in gum. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --2015 organic top line grows about 3% up from Fitch's expectations of 1.5%  earlier in the year. Higher than expected pricing has boosted organic growth to  the 3% range YTD. Growth rates of 2% to 3% are expected thereafter. --Capex at $1.7 billion for 2015 and 5% of revenue in the medium term. --FCF positive in 2015 and moderately negative in 2016 with higher cash  restructuring next year than originally anticipated. --Total debt-to-EBITDA in the 3.4x to 3.5x range in 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: --EBITDA tracks below expectation due to a shortfall in expected operating  margin improvement or further deceleration in organic top-line growth,  aggressive financial policies or engaging in a large debt-financed acquisition,  such that leverage is likely to be consistently above 3.5x.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include: --The Outlook is likely to be revised to Stable if Mondelez sustains organic  growth, including flat-to-positive volumes in the low single-digit range; makes  substantial progress toward its stated margin improvement which would take  EBITDA to or above 2014 levels (with coffee) of $5.6 billion and EBITDA margin  in the 19% to 20% range (relative to LTM EBITDA margin of 17.8%), with the  company comfortably maintaining leverage in the 3.0x - 3.5x range by balancing  shareholder and debtholder interests.  --Over the long term, leverage consistently in the mid- to high-2x range and FCF  above $1 billion annually could support a positive rating action; however, this  is not anticipated in the near- to intermediate-term. LIQUIDITY Mondelez's liquidity at Sept. 30, 2015, includes more than $2 billion in cash  and equivalents and an undrawn $4.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit  facility expiring in October 2018. Mondelez had $1.3 billion in commercial paper  outstanding at quarter end. Upcoming long-term debt maturities are significant  with $1.8 billion due in 2016 and $1.5 billion due in 2017. Fitch believes the  company is likely to refinance 2016 and 2017 maturities and that today's actions  at very low EUR rates are within expectations.  Fitch currently rates Mondelez as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB';  --Senior unsecured debt 'BBB'; --Credit facility 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'.

197,MDLZ,Cadbury maker Mondelez to switch to cage-free eggs by 2020 in U.S.,"(Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), the maker of Cadbury chocolates and Oreo cookies, said it would stop using eggs laid by caged hens for its products sold in the United States and Canada by 2020. Mondelez joins a slew of companies shifting to cage-free eggs amid pressure from consumers and animal-rights groups. The company, which already uses cage-free eggs in all of its European chocolate brands as well as in its biscuit products sold in Belgium and the Netherlands, also said it would switch to cage-free eggs for all its products sold in Europe by 2025. The decision comes at a time when the food industry is under pressure from groups such as the Humane Society of the United States, Mercy for Animals and World Animal Protection, which have successfully lobbied many companies to adopt animal welfare practices. Both General Mills Inc (GIS.N), the maker of Betty Crocker cake mixes, and Kellogg Co (K.N) said last year they would source 100 percent cage-free eggs by 2025. Fast-food companies have made similar announcements. McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) said in September that its 16,000 U.S. and Canadian restaurants would serve only eggs laid by cage-free chicken within 10 years, while Burger King has committed to using such eggs by 2017.

199,MDLZ,Mondelez settles with California over lead in Nabisco Ginger Snaps,"(Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc has agreed to pay $750,000, improve its product sourcing and testing, and hire a food quality auditor after failing to warn California shoppers that its Nabisco Ginger Snaps contained excessive levels of lead. In announcing the settlement with the maker of Oreo and Chips Ahoy cookies, California Attorney General Kamala Harris on Friday said testing revealed that a serving of the ginger snaps contained lead levels up to nine times the threshold requiring a warning under California’s Proposition 65. She said that law, the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, requires a warning to consumers if they are exposed to 0.5 micrograms of lead per serving per day, and that Mondelez was not providing any Proposition 65 warnings. Harris said the lead sources in the ginger snaps were linked to ginger and molasses, and that Mondelez has reformulated the cookies. The probe began in 2013, and the $750,000 payment includes civil penalties, legal fees and costs. “Levels of lead found in Nabisco’s Ginger Snap cookies posed a serious public health threat, potentially impacting the brain development of our children,” Harris said in a statement. “Parents need accurate information to make educated food choices for their children.” A spokesman for Mondelez had no immediate comment. The Deerfield, Illinois-based company’s brands also include Cadbury, Ritz and Triscuit. The consent judgment outlining the settlement was filed on Thursday in an Orange County state court, and awaits a judge’s approval, Harris said.

206,MDLZ,HIGHLIGHTS-Hedge funds pile into SunEdison shares ahead of plunge,"NEW YORK/BOSTON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Top U.S. hedge fund management firms, including Visium Asset Management, took stakes in embattled renewable energy company SunEdison Inc  during the fourth quarter. Visium put on a new position, buying 1.3 million shares,  while Sand Grove Capital Management added a new position of  272,000 shares. Adage Capital Partners bought 9.2 million shares to own 17 million at the end of the quarter. These hedge fund investors did not catch the bottom. Shares of SunEdison are down more than 72 percent so far this year. All told, plenty of managers also exited SunEdison, including Senvest Management, Cobalt Capital Management and the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio. The disclosures are backward-looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter. Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as investment opportunities. The filings do not disclose short positions, or bets that a stock will fall. As a result, the public filings do not always present a complete picture of a management firm’s stock holdings. The following are some of the hot stocks and sectors in which hedge fund managers either took new positions or exited existing stakes in the fourth quarter. Activist investor Jeff Smith’s Starboard Value nearly doubled its holding of the healthcare company to 2.4 million shares.  Hedge fund Visium Asset Management bought roughly 1 million shares to own 1.03 million shares. Fellow activist investor Jana Partners, however, had a different view, slashing its stake by half to own 5.7 million at the end of the quarter. FREEPORT-MCMORAN COPPER AND GOLD INC - CLASS B Passport Capital took a new stake, buying 2.8 million shares. John Burbank’s Passport Capital, one of 2016’s best performers, loaded up a new position, buying 4.9 million shares. Huber Capital trimmed its stake in the nutrition company by selling 96,800 shares to own 1.2 million shares now. Jana Partners exited the car-rental company, selling 39.2 million shares. Distressed investor Marc Lasry exited the bond insurer, selling 75,000 shares. Third Point put on a new position with 3 million shares. Carlson Capital bought 2.2 million shares to own 2.3 million shares, while Adage Capital added to its position, buying 1.6 million shares to own 4.5 million shares at the end of the quarter. Some existing investors in candy and food maker Mondelez, which has caught the attention of activists Pershing Square Capital and Trian Partners, raised their stakes, including Passport Capital, which owned 1.2 million at the end of the quarter. Zweig-Dimenna Associates bought 187,900 additional shares to own 394,650 shares. But Boston-based Adage Capital Partners cut its stake nearly in half, selling 2.2 million shares to own 2.7 million at the end of the quarter. Activist hedge fund Jana Partners added a new stake of 9.2 million shares. Suvretta Capital added 1.9 million shares to own 2.5 million. Seth Klarman’s Baupost Group exited the stock, selling 4.1 million shares.  Senator Investment Group also exited its position, selling 500,000. The embattled drug maker, whose stock price tumbled last year amid questions about accounting and business practices, also saw a lot of activity. Aaron Cowen’s Suvretta, exited its  position of 354,750 shares.  Visium Asset Management sold its position of 1 million shares. But some investors also saw fresh value, and Jana Partners took a new position, buying 1.56 million. Brahman Capital nearly doubled its position, acquiring  4.1 million shares to own 8.1 million at the end of the quarter. Activist investor Starboard Value cut its stake in the packaging company by 26 percent to  4.5 million shares. Jana Partners took a new position of 3.8 million shares. Jet Capital added a new position, buying 2.1 million shares,  while Carlson Capital bought 2.9 million shares, also a new position. Serengeti took a new position in the restaurant company, buying 135,000 shares. Jana Partners sold 3.9 million shares to exit the animal health company, which was spun off by Pfizer.

211,MDLZ,"Warren Buffett defends 3G, touts economy in record year for Berkshire","(Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday used his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) shareholders to launch vigorous defenses of an aggressive private equity partner and a maligned mobile home unit, as his conglomerate recorded robust profits. The world’s third-richest person and a revered investor, Buffett also injected himself into the contentious 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, lambasting candidates who talk down the nation’s economic future as “dead wrong” - an apparent jab at Republicans and frontrunner Donald Trump. Buffett, who is backing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, also raised a political issue dear to Democrats in his widely-read letter by calling climate change a “major problem for the planet,” although not one for Berkshire’s future.  Buffett, 85, also made no mention of who might succeed him at Berkshire, which he has run for a half-century, and in passing said he expects to be around at age 100. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company reported a record full-year profit of $24.08 billion, up 21 percent, while operating profit rose 5 percent to a record $17.36 billion. Fourth quarter profit was up 32 percent, and operating profit rose a larger-than-expected 18 percent. Berkshire owns roughly 90 businesses in areas as insurance, railroads, energy, food, apparel and real estate. Buffett himself is worth $62.1 billion, Forbes magazine reported. But he has critics, and spent about 10 percent of his roughly 18,000-word letter defending 3G Capital, a Brazilian firm in which Berkshire owns 51 percent of Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), and Berkshire’s Clayton Homes mobile home unit. Many shareholders questioned Buffett’s compatibility with 3G, an aggressive cost cutter led by Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann. Berkshire and 3G teamed up in 2013 to buy H.J. Heinz and last year merged it with Kraft Foods. Buffett also helped finance 3G’s merger of Burger King with Canadian donut chain Tim Hortons, creating Restaurant Brands International Inc (QSR.TO). Following these mergers, 3G slashed thousands of jobs. Buffett acknowledged that while he and 3G “follow different paths” in running businesses, 3G has been “extraordinarily successful,” and more ventures are possible. “Jorge Paulo and his associates could not be better partners,” Buffett wrote. Clayton has been faulted in articles in the Seattle Times for predatory lending and discrimination against blacks and Latinos, which the large mobile home builder denies. But Buffett called Clayton a careful lender, and said it has escaped major regulatory fines despite 65 state and federal reviews in the last two years. Management delivers “industry-leading performance,” Buffett said. Buffett praised Berkshire’s earnings power, saying that only a catastrophic cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack on the United States posed a “clear, present and enduring danger” to the company.

212,MDLZ,"UPDATE 2-Warren Buffett defends 3G, touts economy in record year for Berkshire","(Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday used his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) shareholders to launch vigorous defenses of an aggressive private equity partner and a maligned mobile home unit, as his conglomerate recorded robust profits. The world’s third-richest person and a revered investor, Buffett also injected himself into the contentious 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, lambasting candidates who talk down the nation’s economic future as “dead wrong” - an apparent jab at Republicans and frontrunner Donald Trump. Buffett, who is backing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, also raised a political issue dear to Democrats in his widely-read letter by calling climate change a “major problem for the planet,” although not one for Berkshire’s future.  Buffett, 85, also made no mention of who might succeed him at Berkshire, which he has run for a half-century, and in passing said he expects to be around at age 100. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company reported a record full-year profit of $24.08 billion, up 21 percent, while operating profit rose 5 percent to a record $17.36 billion. Fourth quarter profit was up 32 percent, and operating profit rose a larger-than-expected 18 percent. Berkshire owns roughly 90 businesses in areas as insurance, railroads, energy, food, apparel and real estate. Buffett himself is worth $62.1 billion, Forbes magazine reported. But he has critics, and spent about 10 percent of his roughly 18,000-word letter defending 3G Capital, a Brazilian firm in which Berkshire owns 51 percent of Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), and Berkshire’s Clayton Homes mobile home unit. Many shareholders questioned Buffett’s compatibility with 3G, an aggressive cost cutter led by Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann. Berkshire and 3G teamed up in 2013 to buy H.J. Heinz and last year merged it with Kraft Foods. Buffett also helped finance 3G’s merger of Burger King with Canadian donut chain Tim Hortons, creating Restaurant Brands International Inc (QSR.TO). Following these mergers, 3G slashed thousands of jobs. Buffett acknowledged that while he and 3G “follow different paths” in running businesses, 3G has been “extraordinarily successful,” and more ventures are possible. “Jorge Paulo and his associates could not be better partners,” Buffett wrote. Clayton has been faulted in articles in the Seattle Times for predatory lending and discrimination against blacks and Latinos, which the large mobile home builder denies. But Buffett called Clayton a careful lender, and said it has escaped major regulatory fines despite 65 state and federal reviews in the last two years. Management delivers “industry-leading performance,” Buffett said. Buffett praised Berkshire’s earnings power, saying that only a catastrophic cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack on the United States posed a “clear, present and enduring danger” to the company. Buffett also rejected the dour economic outlooks polluting the presidential campaign. Trump has repeatedly said the U.S. economy is in a “bubble” that he hopes will pop before he takes office. “I don’t want to inherit all this stuff,” he has said. Buffett said such concerns are overblown. “For 240 years it’s been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start,” Buffett said. “The babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history.” Buffett urged shareholders to reject a proxy proposal that would require greater disclosures about how climate change might affect Berkshire’s insurance businesses. “It seems highly likely to me that climate change poses a major problem for the planet,” Buffett wrote. “But when you are thinking only as a shareholder of a major insurer, climate change should not be on your list of worries.” Buffett touted the BNSF railroad and its leaders Matt Rose and Carl Ice, calling their $5.8 billion of capital spending to improve customer service after a poor 2014 “money well spent.” Though Buffett did not mention falling oil prices in his letter, Berkshire’s annual report said low oil prices may reduce BNSF’s profit in 2016 as industrial freight volumes decline.

213,MDLZ,"Warren Buffett defends 3G, Clayton Homes as Berkshire profit grows","Feb 27 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday launched vigorous defenses of a private equity firm and a mobile home unit that critics say employ controversial business practices antithetical to Buffett’s own at Berkshire Hathaway Inc . In his widely-read annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett said he would do more deals with 3G Capital, a Brazilian firm with which Berkshire owns a majority of Kraft Heinz Co , but which, unlike Berkshire, is known as a ruthless cost-cutter. Buffett also devoted more than 1,200 words in his roughly 18,000-word letter to defending Berkshire’s Clayton Homes unit,  after articles in the Seattle Times accused the nation’s largest mobile home builder of predatory lending and exploiting black and Latino borrowers. Berkshire reported a record full-year profit of $24.08 billion, up 21 percent from a year earlier, while operating profit rose 5 percent to a record $17.36 billion. In the fourth quarter, profit rose 32 percent to $5.48 billion, or $3,333 per Class A share. Operating profit rose 18 percent to $4.67 billion, or $2,843 per share, topping the average analyst forecast of $2,814 according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Buffett, 85, has in nearly 51 years running Berkshire transformed it from a failing textile company into a conglomerate with roughly 90 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, energy, food, apparel and real estate. His work has also made him an investing legend and the world’s third-richest person, according to Forbes magazine. But his tie-up with 3G, led by the Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann, has attracted criticism. Last year, at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, many shareholders wanted to know if Berkshire’s business principles were compatible with 3G, which has made its name as an aggressive cost-cutter that appoints its own executives and eliminates thousands of jobs at the companies it acquires. Berkshire and 3G in 2013 bought the former H.J. Heinz, and two years later merged it with the former Kraft Foods. Buffett has also helped finance 3G’s merger of Burger King with Canadian donut chain Tim Hortons. In his letter, Buffett acknowledged that while he and 3G “follow different paths” toward buying and running businesses, 3G’s method has been “extraordinarily successful”, and that more deals are possible. “Jorge Paulo and his associates could not be better partners,” Buffett wrote. “We share with them a passion to buy, build and hold large businesses that satisfy basic needs and desires.” Buffett also praised Clayton, saying that it made home ownership possible for many even during the financial crisis, and that it has to be a careful lender because it keeps the mortgage loans it makes on its books. Yet he said that in the last two years, regulators from the federal government and 25 U.S. states examined Clayton and its mortgages a total of 65 times, yet this scrutiny has led to just $38,200 of fines and $704,678 of refunds to customers. Clayton’s management still delivers “industry-leading performance,” Buffett said.

Mondelez had been the firm’s second largest position with 43 million shares. The sale, which was executed for portfolio management purposes, cut the firm’s ownership stake to 5.6 percent from 7.5 percent.

215,MDLZ,"Ackman sells part of Mondelez stake, has no plans for other sales","BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman adjusted his battered hedge fund portfolio on Wednesday when he sold 20 million shares of snack maker Mondelez International (MDLZ.O), one day after another key holding, Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX.TO), lost half of its value. In a three paragraph letter sent to investors after the close of trading on Wednesday and seen by Reuters, Ackman said his firm, Pershing Square, has no plans to sell other investments right now and has “substantial uninvested cash.”  The letter came one day after Pershing Square lost about $800 million when Valeant was pummeled after raising the possibility that it may default on its debt and posting a worse-than-expected financial outlook. Ackman’s Pershing Square Holdings has now lost 26.4 percent since January, marking one of the worst performances in the hedge fund industry this year. Before today’s sale, Pershing Square owned 43 million shares, or 7.5 percent,  of Mondelez, which makes Oreo cookies, Trident gum and Milka chocolate. It now owns 5.6 percent of the company. The hedge fund unveiled its position in Mondelez in August 2015 and has since been pushing for a sale. “We continue to believe in the potential for operating improvements and margin expansion that we expect will lead to substantial further increases in value,” Ackman wrote in the letter.  On Tuesday, Ackman barely contained his frustration with Valeant in an earlier note, warning the company and assuring his investors that Pershing Square was “going to take a more proactive role at the company to protect and maximize the value of our investment.”  Last week, Pershing Square’s vice chairman, Steve Fraidin, a veteran mergers and acquisitions lawyer, joined Valeant’s board. It was roughly a year ago that Ackman unveiled his investment in Valeant, coming not quite a year after working with the fast-growing company on a deal in 2014 to buy Allergan, in which Pershing Square owned shares. The bet on Allergan helped Pershing Square earn a 40 percent gain in 2014. The size of Ackman’s fund has shrunk dramatically to roughly $12 billion at the end of February from about $19 billion in early 2015. But because he listed shares on the Amsterdam stock exchange in 2014, he has a cushion of permanent capital. Still, investors have expressed concern about the fund’s performance and Ackman urged them in Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s letters to call the investor relations team or him personally with any questions.

Volumes rose in some of its biggest markets such as North America and Asia Pacific, where it also raised prices. In Europe, its biggest market by revenue, volumes also rose but the company cut prices there.

232,MDLZ,"Kraft, Mondelez must face wheat price-rigging lawsuit - U.S. judge","(Reuters) - A federal judge in Chicago on Monday refused to dismiss a lawsuit in which wheat futures and options traders accused Kraft Heinz Co and Mondelez International Inc  of illegally manipulating the grain’s price at their expense. U.S. District Judge Edmond Chang said traders may pursue claims that a large and, in their view, unnecessary late 2011 purchase by Kraft Foods Inc of wheat futures contracts violated the Sherman antitrust law and the Commodity Exchange Act. In a 66-page decision, Chang also dismissed claims that the defendants conducted offsetting “wash trades” over roughly a decade to create an illusion of greater market activity. He said the traders can try to bring those claims again. Kraft and Mondelez were named as defendants because most of the alleged suspicious activity occurred before Kraft Foods Inc split in two in 2012. Mondelez brands now include snack foods such as Oreos, Ritz crackers and Wheat Thins.

Now, Mondelez International Inc’s audacious bid on Thursday for Hershey Co, to create by far the world’s largest cocoa buyer, could hand the bargaining chips in the volatile niche market back to the candy makers. With more buying power, candy makers could demand lower prices from traders already operating on thin margins. Hershey’s board of directors unanimously rejected Mondelez’s $23 billion takeover bid on Thursday. Even so, the combined company would cushion Mondelez from wild swings in prices of key ingredients. Soaring cocoa, dairy and nut prices forced some in recent years to raise prices, but the sticker shock for sweet-toothed shoppers hurt sales. But the bid also raised the specter of consolidation among chocolate makers, which could create larger buyers of commodities including cocoa and sugar, worrying middlemen who have already seen their margins squeezed. The additional pricing power of the new entity would be “concerning,” a veteran cocoa buyer said. Mondelez is already the world’s largest cocoa consumer, and after a tie-up with Hershey it would consume 650,000 tonnes per year, 50 percent more than the No. 2 consumer, Nestle SA , according to the Cocoa Barometer publication by nonprofit industry watchdog VOICE Network. Global cocoa demand totals around 4 million tonnes annually. “You create a huge giant as far as cocoa consumption is concerned,” said Antonie Fountain, VOICE managing director. The most immediate questions raised by the potential deal concern the companies’ relationships with Swiss processor Barry Callebaut AG, which became the world’s largest manufacturer of chocolate and cocoa products after a 2013 purchase of Petra Foods’ cocoa business. In 2007, Barry Callebaut reached a deal to supply Hershey with chocolate through 2022. Three years later, it agreed to supply Kraft Foods - which spun off Mondelez in 2012 - with the majority of its cocoa products and industrial chocolate globally. It remains a top supplier after the spinoff, sources said. The fact that Barry Callebaut supplies both companies reduces its risk of being squeezed out, but a combined company would likely look for alternatives and exert some leverage on prices, four industry experts each with decades of experience said. “If it were me, I would look to diversify away from Barry,” said one of the sources. They spoke only on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to comment to the press. Representatives of Barry Callebaut and Cargill Inc  both declined to comment. Cocoa processor Blommer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Growing purchasing power in the downstream sector would squeeze already-tight margins among processors, one trade source said. Grinders and processors have consolidated in response to tight competition amid stagnant demand. “This makes them one more powerful buyer in an already consolidated industry,” said a sugar trader with a global firm.

241,MDLZ,Hershey rejects $23 billion Mondelez takeover offer,"(Reuters) - Hershey Co (HSY.N) said on Thursday it had rejected a $23 billion takeover bid by Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) that would seek to expand the latter’s limited U.S. footprint and create the world’s largest confectioner. The snub underscores the challenges Mondelez Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld faces in wooing Hershey’s controlling shareholder, the Hershey Trust, a $12 billion charity created by the eponymous company’s founder a century ago.  The maker of Hershey’s Kisses and Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups saw its shares trade above Mondelez’s bid of $107 per share in cash and stock, indicating investors expected a new offer. A merger of two of the world’s top five candy makers would add Hershey’s strong U.S. business to Mondelez’s global footprint.      Earlier, a source said that Mondelez had sought to provide assurances to Hershey that it would keep its name and preserve jobs. Mondelez sees little antitrust risk given the limited geographic overlap of the two companies’ businesses, the source added. “The board of directors of the company unanimously rejected the indication of interest and determined that it provided no basis for further discussion between Mondelez and the company,” Hershey said in a statement.     Hershey shares ended trading on Thursday up 16.8 percent at $113.49, while Mondelez rose 5.9 percent to $45.51.     Mondelez, the maker of Oreos cookies, is the second-largest confectionary company globally, while Hershey ranks number five. Their merger would put them in the top place at 18 percent of the market, according to market research firm Euromonitor International Ltd. The combined company would leapfrog Mars Inc, which has 13.3 percent of the global market. A fusion of the two would give Mondelez control over the production and distribution of Cadbury brand chocolates in the United States, which Hershey currently holds the license to produce, paying royalties to Mondelez.  It would also give Mondelez the U.S. production and distribution rights for Kit Kat, one of the most popular chocolate brands in the world, which industry sources said would be a significant boost to Mondelez. Nestle SA (NESN.S) manufactures Kit Kat worldwide, but Hershey has the rights in the United States, paying Nestle royalties from sales. Mondelez’s bid could put pressure on Nestle to consider its own bid for Hershey.  Upon change of control at Hershey, the license would revert back to Nestle for free, depriving value for a potential acquirer. The bid pits Deerfield, Illinois-based Mondelez against the Hershey Trust, one of Pennsylvania’s wealthiest charities. The trust has about 81 percent of Hershey’s voting rights and in 2002 prevented the Hershey, Pennsylvania-based company from being acquired by Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co for $12 billion. Pennsylvania’s attorney general also sued to block the Wrigley deal, arguing it would hurt the local community. Created by Hershey founder Milton Hershey to provide for the Milton Hershey School, a private school for children from low-income families, the trust has been the subject of an investigation recently by Pennsylvania’s attorney general over conflicts of interest and mismanagement.  The trust’s chief compliance officer was put on leave last month after a leaked memo showed the board had spent nearly $4 million investigating conflicts of interest and insider-trading accusations against board members. A top trust official was also sacked in May and pled guilty to wire fraud. Tigress Financial Partners LLC analyst Philip Van Deusen said he expected the offer price to increase, given the rise in Hershey’s shares. “I think ($107) is a good starting place,” he said. Analysts have been skeptical of takeover bids for Hershey in the past.    “The Trust ... is outwardly very committed to keeping the company independent,” Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard said in June last year. “So it’s pretty much impossible for an activist to get involved or for the company to be bought.”  Last year, William Ackman revealed his activist hedge fund Pershing Square had built a stake worth about $5.5 billion in Mondelez, in what was seen as an attempt to push the company to boost earnings or sell itself. Ackman joined fellow activist Nelson Peltz as an investor in Mondelez.

251,MDLZ,UPDATE 3-Oreo maker Mondelez fights North America biscuit rivals,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Oreo maker Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) is fighting back against aggressive rivals in North America after its share of the biscuit market there declined in the second quarter, the company said on Wednesday. It also said it would launch its Milka brand chocolate into China’s $2.8 billion market, sparking questions from analysts unsure about the timing of the move. The announcement came as Mondelez reported that revenues had declined for the 11th consecutive quarter due to weakness outside of North America. Adjusted quarterly earnings still beat analysts’ expectations. Mondelez shares fell 2.9 percent to close at $43.94. “Mondelez has suffered from a general slowdown in consumer demand for snacks across the globe, in particular in those countries that were once shining beacons of hope - China, Brazil and India,” said Jack Skelly, food analyst for Euromonitor International.

252,MDLZ,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Oreo maker Mondelez's revenue falls for 11th straight quarter,"(Corrects paragraph 8 to say the company’s revenue “missed”, not “beat”, analysts’ estimates) July 27 (Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc’s  quarterly net revenue slumped nearly 18 percent, the 11th straight quarter of decline, as sales fell in markets outside North America. The Oreo cookie and Cadbury chocolate maker’s shares declined about 1 percent to $44.73 in light premarket trading on Wednesday. Mondelez said sales fell by 26.5 percent in Europe, its biggest market, in the second quarter. The company gets more than a quarter of its total revenue from the region. Sales plunged by a third in Latin America and fell slightly in Asia Pacific. However, Mondelez said it expected incremental earnings of 3-5 cents per share for the full year. Lower-than-expected interest expenses and strong results from its coffee joint venture investments will offset the impact of a strong dollar and Britain’s vote to exit the European Union, the company said. Mondelez holds its coffee business in a joint venture with D.E. Master Blenders. Separately, Mondelez said its “Milka” chocolates and more than a dozen core products would hit shelves in China from September. The company’s net revenue fell to $6.30 billion in the quarter ended June 30, missing the average analyst estimate of $6.33 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to the company rose 14.3 percent to $464 million, or 29 cents per share. Excluding items, Mondelez earned 44 cents per share, topping the average estimate of 40 cents.

Shares of Mondelez, the maker of Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolates, rose nearly 4 percent in extended trading on Monday, while Hershey’s shares plunged about 12 percent. Hershey rejected a $23 billion cash-and-stock offer by Mondelez in June. “Following additional discussions, and taking into account recent shareholder developments at Hershey, we determined that there is no actionable path forward toward an agreement,” Mondelez Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld said on Monday. The reform agreement for Hershey Trust came after an investigation of several months by the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s office over the charitable trust’s governance, compensation and expenses. The trust, set up by Hershey’s eponymous founder a century ago, holds 81 percent of the company’s voting stock and a sale is impossible without its approval. “While we are disappointed in this outcome, we remain disciplined in our approach to creating value, including through acquisitions,” Rosenfeld said on Monday.

Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen painted a rosy picture of the U.S. economy at an economic symposium on Friday and said the case for a rate hike was strengthening, but gave little indication on when the central bank could next move. Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer, in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Tuesday, said the U.S. job market is close to full strength and the pace of interest rate hikes will depend on how well the economy is doing. Investors are awaiting a report on monthly payrolls data due on Friday to assess whether it supports the hawkish tone that Fed officials have taken. “I think today is going to be flat to down a little bit, simply because of yesterday’s strong move,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial. “Investors are going to need some time to digest that. It is a quiet week with a lot of people at the beach.” The S&P; 500 and the Dow snapped a three-day losing streak on Monday, helped by a lift in financials and commodity stocks after strong consumer spending data pointed to a pickup in U.S. economic growth.

Data due on Tuesday is expected to show the consumer confidence index dipped to 97 in August after hitting 97.3 last month. The report is due at 10:00 a.m. ET (1400 GMT). The dollar index rose 0.21 percent, continuing to trade at a more than two-week high on higher prospects of a rate increase.

267,MDLZ,Mondelez outlines U.S. growth plans after Hershey snub,"(Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), the maker of Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolates, outlined on Wednesday its plans to expand in the United States, a week after abandoning its pursuit of U.S. confectioner Hershey Co (HSY.N). Mondelez, the second-largest confectionary company in the world, said on Wednesday it would bring to the United States its Milka Oreo chocolate bars that pairs Oreo cookies with Milka, which is popular in Europe. The Milka Oreo chocolate bars, which are already available in more than 20 countries, are targeted at the mainstream segment of the roughly $14 billion U.S. chocolate market, Mondelez said. In the premium segment, Mondelez is expanding its Green & Blacks products, which contain no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives. Mondelez said on Aug. 29 it was no longer pursuing the acquisition of Hershey, the number five confectionary company in the world, two months after the company turned down its $23 billion cash-and-stock bid. The merger of Mondelez with Hershey, which makes Hershey’s Kisses and Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, would have expanded the former’s limited U.S. footprint and created the world’s largest confectioner. Instead, now Mondelez has to chalk out its own course. Mondelez also said on Wednesday it was strengthening its sales and distribution operations, enhancing in-store execution and chalking out better routes to market, especially in emerging markets. The company said it was building up its e-commerce snacks business with the aim of generating at least $1 billion in revenue by 2020.

271,MDLZ,Investors urge food companies to shift from meat to plants,"LONDON (Reuters) - A group of 40 investors managing $1.25 trillion in assets have launched a campaign to encourage 16 global food companies to change the way they source protein for their products to help to reduce environmental and health risks. The investors, which include the fund arm of insurer Aviva and several Swedish state pension funds, wrote to the food companies on Sept. 23 urging them to respond to the “material” risks of industrial farming and to diversify into plant-based sources of protein. Among the companies targeted were Kraft Heinz, Nestle, Unilever, Tesco and Walmart, a statement by the Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return Initiative, which organized the investor group, said on Monday.  “The world’s over reliance on factory farmed livestock to feed the growing global demand for protein is a recipe for a financial, social and environmental crisis,” said Jeremy Coller, founder of the FAIRR initiative and chief investment officer at private equity company Coller Capital. Pollution from intensive livestock production is already at too high a level, while safety and welfare standards are too low and the industry cannot cope with the projected increase in global protein demand, Coller said. “Investors want to know if major food companies have a strategy to avoid this protein bubble and to profit from a plant-based protein market set to grow by 8.4 percent annually over the next five years,” Coller said. The campaign follows an Oxford University study which said $1.5 trillion in healthcare and climate change-related costs could be saved by 2050 if people reduced their reliance on meat in their diet. The study also pointed to growing political pressure on companies to change, citing a consultation in Denmark on the introduction of a red meat tax and a Chinese government plan to reduce its citizens’ meat consumption by 50 percent, FAIRR said. Ella McKinley, ethics analyst at Australian Ethical Investment, which is taking part in the campaign, said the need to change food production models was essential to help to limit climate change. “Forward-looking companies can move now to encourage more sustainable diets by reducing reliance on meat and growing the market for plant-based protein alternatives. In the process, companies make their own protein supply chains more resilient to future shocks,” she said. The other companies written to by FAIRR were General Mills, Mondelez International, Ahold-Delhaize, The Co-operative Group, Costco Wholesale Corporation, Kroger Company, Marks & Spencer, Wm Morrison Supermarkets, Ocado, Sainsbury’s and Whole Foods Market. A Nestle spokeswoman said the company did not use much meat, “so our main strategy is not to focus on replacing the meat that we do use as its impact would be minimal. Our main opportunities lie in innovating new products using alternate proteins”. “In terms of timetables and targets, this is still a relatively new area, where in many countries the consumers are not fully prepared to replace or reduce meat in their diets. Our focus is to innovate great tasting solutions to encourage consumers to try them and over time make small, sustainable shifts towards a higher plant-based, more balanced diet.” Kraft Heinz declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The Co-Op said it had yet to receive the letter. Mondelez also declined to comment because it had not yet seen the letter, while a Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: “We’re aware of the issue and are looking forward to receiving a copy of the letter.” A Walmart spokesman said the company was not familiar with the campaign and so could not provide comment, while a Kroger spokesman said the firm had not received the letter but was happy to talk with the investor group. The remaining companies were not immediately available to comment. Among the other investors to join the campaign were Nordea Asset Management, the fund arm of Norwegian lender Nordea, Boston Common Asset Management, and Impax Asset Management, as well as a number of charities and other ethical investors.

272,MDLZ,Fitch Affirms Mondelez's IDR at 'BBB'; Outlook Revised to Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) for Mondelez International, Inc. (Mondelez) at 'BBB'. The  Rating Outlook has been revised to Stable from Negative. A full list of ratings  follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Increased Confidence in 2018 EBIT Margin Target of 17%-18%: The revision of the Outlook to Stable reflects Fitch's increased confidence in  Mondelez's ability to improve EBIT margins to the targeted 17%-18% range in 2018  from 14.7% in 2015 on 2%-3% annual organic revenue growth. The improvement will  primarily be driven by the large restructuring program the company put in place  in 2014 to realize $1.5 billion in annualized savings by 2018 in the areas of  supply chain, overhead costs, and other organizational efficiencies. Free cash  flow (FCF; after dividends, cash restructuring charges, and pension  contribution) is expected to improve from $200 million-$300 million in 2016 to  over $1.5 billion in 2018, as the company cycles heavy restructuring-related  cash payments and capex over the next 2-3 years. Debt/EBITDA is expected to  trend toward 3.0x by 2018 from an expected 3.5x in 2016 on EBITDA growth.  Risks to the ratings include prolonged weakness in organic sales growth with  Mondelez growing below industry-category sales growth and higher than expected  investments needed to drive sales which would preclude the company from  achieving the targeted EBIT margins. Debt financed share buybacks and M&A;  activity that keeps leverage elevated in the mid-to-high 3x are also rating  concerns. Fitch expects M&A; activity to continue in the packaged food sector as  companies optimize product portfolio, geographic exposure, and seek cost  reduction opportunities. Mondelez's attempted takeover of Hershey would have  been a transformative event for the company. While Mondelez's rating does not  factor a major M&A; event, the company could be acquisitive or even the target of  a larger multinational food company over the rating horizon. Favorable Portfolio Mix Fitch views Mondelez as having a favorable product mix relative to its  packaged-food peers given that 80% of its sales are geared towards snacks, which  Fitch expects should grow in the 2%-3% range going forward (versus 6%  historically) against flat to 1% for overall packaged foods. The snacking  category is well-aligned with consumer trends of eating more frequent, smaller  meals, and convenience. In addition, 40% of its sales come from emerging markets  which have near-term headwinds but strong growth prospects longer term. This  supports long-term organic growth of 2%-3%, which Fitch expects will be driven  equally from volume growth and pricing over the medium term.  Mondelez is one of the world's largest snack companies, with 2016 projected  revenues of approximately $26 billion and an attractive portfolio of sweet snack  brands. The company operates in approximately 165 countries and has #1 global  market shares in biscuits and candy, as well as #2 global shares in chocolate  and gum. Oreo, Cadbury, Nabisco, Dairy Milk, LU, Milka, and Trident each  generate more than $1 billion in annual sales. Power Brands, which make up 68%  of sales, are the company's fastest growing and highest-margin global and  regional brands. These brands have grown at about twice the pace of overall  sales during the past few years and have margins 100bps to 200bps higher than  the company's other brands. Power Brands also receive about 80% of advertising  and consumer (A&C;) expenditures. Restructuring Program to Yield Industry Level Margins Management has been focused on improving efficiency as Mondelez was created  through a series of acquisitions made by legacy Kraft that were never properly  optimized or integrated. In 2014, the company announced a $3.5 billion  restructuring program to be executed from 2014 through 2018 with $2.5 billion in  cash costs. The purpose is to reduce supply chain and overhead costs by $1.5  billion by the end of 2018. This would be supported by an incremental $1.6  billion in capex to upgrade its manufacturing facilities and the company expects  70% of its Power Brand sales will move to upgraded facilities by 2018 versus 25%  in 2015.  EBIT margin has improved steadily to 15% for the LTM period ending June 30, 2016  versus 12.1% in 2013 and Fitch views Mondelez's margin targets of 17%-18% in  2018 as achievable, and would bring Mondelez more in line with industry  averages.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's assumptions in its base case projections are as follows: --Organic growth of about 2% in 2016, with 2%-3% growth expected thereafter.  Currency impact is assumed to be neutral beginning 2017. --EBIT margin is expected to be 15.1% in 2016, versus 14.2% in 2015, and expand  to 17%-18% in 2018. --EBITDA margin is expected to be 18%-19% in 2016, versus 17.7% in 2015, and  expand to the 21% range in 2018. --Capex is expected to peak at $1.4 billion in 2016 and decline by $100 million  thereafter to $1.2 billion by 2018 as restructuring-related capex declines over  time.  --FCF (after dividends, cash restructuring charges, and pension contribution) of  over $200 million in 2016, improving to over $1.5 billion in 2018. --Total debt-to-EBITDA of around 3.5x in 2016, assuming $2 billion in additional  debt (in the form of commercial paper borrowings) to fund around $2 billion  in share buybacks. Leverage is expected to trend towards 3x in 2018, driven  primarily by EBITDA growth.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: --EBITDA tracks below expectation due to a shortfall in expected operating  margin improvement or deceleration in organic top-line growth, aggressive  financial policies or engaging in a large debt-financed acquisition, such that  leverage is consistently above 3.5x.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include: --Organic growth in line with or better than category growth --EBITDA margins in line with or better than industry average --Leverage consistently below 3x. LIQUIDITY Mondelez's liquidity at June 30, 2016 includes more than $1.8 billion in cash  and equivalents and an undrawn $4.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit  facility expiring in October 2018. Mondelez had $2.4 billion in CP outstanding  at June 30, 2016. Upcoming long-term debt maturities are significant with $1.5  billion due in 2017, which Fitch believes the company is likely to refinance.  FCF (after dividends, cash restructuring charges, and pension contribution) is  expected to improve from $200 million-$300 million in 2016 to over $1.5 billion  in 2018, as the company cycles heavy restructuring-related cash payments and  capex over the next 2-3 years. Debt/EBITDA is expected to trend towards 3.0x by  2018 from an expected 3.5x in 2016 on EBITDA growth.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed Mondelez's ratings as follows: --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB';  --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB'; --Credit facility at 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'.

276,MDLZ,"Oreo maker Mondelez reins in costs, raises profit forecast","(Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc’s (MDLZ.O) quarterly profit handily beat estimates, helped by cost cuts, and the Cadbury chocolate maker raised its profit forecast for the year, sending its shares up as much as 4.6 percent on Wednesday. Since separating from Kraft in 2012, Mondelez has concentrated on increasing its profit margins by reducing costs through internal controls, divestitures and asset sales. The company is in the midst of a $3 billion cost saving program, which runs till the end of 2018, opening more efficient manufacturing plants and using zero-based budgeting (ZBB), which requires expenses to be justified for each new period. Mondelez has targeted cost savings of 30-50 percent in 12 areas including travel, sales support services and business events. ZBB efforts in travel have cut costs by 30 percent, Mondelez spokeswoman Valerie Moens told Reuters. Overall selling, general and administrative expenses fell 13.3 percent to $1.6 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Net sales fell 6.6 percent to $6.40 billion, hurt by a  strong dollar and the deconsolidation of its Venezuela operations. Organic net revenue grew 1.1 percent in the quarter, driven by sales of Oreos and Trident gum. “We were pleased to see overall volumes were positive along with solid organic revenue growth especially considering many other competitors are struggling to grow sales,” Brittany Weisman, consumer staples analyst with Edward Jones said. The company, however, cut its full-year organic growth forecast to about 1.6 percent from at least 2 percent earlier due to deceleration in some markets such as the Middle East where low oil prices have stifled demand.     Mondelez also raised its forecast for adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be up about 25 percent on a constant currency basis from its previous expectations of double-digit growth. Net income attributable to the company fell to $548 million, or 35 cents per share, in the quarter, from $7.27 billion, or $4.46 per share, a year earlier. The company had a $6.8 billion one-time gain from a joint venture with Dutch group D.E. Master Blenders, last year. Excluding items, the company earned 52 cents per share in the third quarter, beating analysts’ average estimate of 43 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts on average had expected net revenue of $6.45 billion.

283,MDLZ,"UPDATE 3-Hershey profit beats estimates on U.S. demand, lower ad spending","(Reuters) - Hershey Co (HSY.N), the maker of Hershey’s Kisses and Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as demand strengthened in the United States and the company spent less on advertising and marketing. Hershey’s shares rose almost 7 percent to $101.91 on Friday morning, their biggest intraday percentage gain since June, when Mondelez’s offer to buy the company became public. Hershey’s North America sales, which account for about 85 percent of total sales, rose 1.8 percent to $1.76 billion in the third quarter ended Oct. 2. Consumers are visiting stores more frequently and are “beginning to spend a little bit more confidently than before,” Chief Executive John Bilbrey said on a conference call. Hershey is introducing new products to overcome weak demand in North America due to changing consumer tastes and growing competition. The launch of Reese’s Pieces Cups, which combine the Peanut Butter Cups with Reese’s Pieces, increased sales of the brand by about 8 percent in the quarter, Bilbrey said. Hershey also plans to launch Cookie Layer Crunch, a chocolate bar with layers of cookie bits, during the holidays and said it has “good visibility” into product’s holiday sales. “While sales growth has been weak for the business, any improvement in category growth rates in the U.S. in particular, but also in China, could move shares higher,” Stifel analyst Christopher Growe wrote in a note, referring to his $94 price target. Hershey, since rejecting the $23 billion offer from Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), is working to cut costs by consolidating its supply chain and some factories in China and North America, and spending less on advertising. The company said it expects 2016 capital expenditure at the lower end of its reduced range of $265 million-$275 million. Hershey is set to undergo a management overhaul, with Bilbrey retiring next year. The charitable trust which controls the company reached a major reform agreement with its overseer, the Pennsylvania attorney general’s office, following a months-long investigation. The company’s net income rose 47 percent to $227.4 million, or $1.06 per share, in the quarter, helped by lower costs. Excluding items, Hershey earned $1.29 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.18 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 2.2 percent to $2 billion, in line with analysts’ average estimate. Hershey raised its 2016 adjusted earnings forecast to $4.28-$4.32 per share from $4.24-$4.28, citing cost savings and a slightly more favorable tax rate than expected.

Alexandre Behring, the 3G partner who is in charge of the firm’s day-to-day operations, has remained closely involved in the fundraising effort, the blog said.

Investors have long speculated what the next target for Lemann, who is worth $28 billion according to Forbes Magazine, and 3G could be Oreo cookies maker Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) or General Mills Inc (GIS.N), which owns Pillsbury and Betty Crocker.  The blog said an acquisition would be done through Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), in which 3G has a 24 percent stake. Shares in Mondelez gained 3.7 percent to $45.87, while General Mills added 2.4 percent to $63.32 in mid-afternoon trading on Tuesday. According to the blog, Lemann’s camp has declined politely checks between $20 million and $50 million for the new fund, on the grounds that larger money commitments could optimize any fundraising efforts. Tennis player Roger Federer and supermodel Gisele Bündchen are among investors in the new vehicle, Brazil Journal said. Lemann, a globe-trotting financier with Swiss roots, rose to prominence over the past decade following a series of mega deals that drew praise and funding from U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett. Both tycoons have teamed up several times in the past, the most recent being a joint effort to buy ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co for $23.2 billion three years ago. Harvard University-educated Lemann and longtime partners Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles are 3G Capital’s main partners. They are one of the largest investors in Anheuser Busch InBev SA (ABI.BR), the world’s largest beer maker. Buffett also helped finance the 3G-engineered merger of Burger King Corp with Canadian donut chain Tim Hortons, creating Restaurant Brands International Inc (QSR.TO).

290,MDLZ,Nestle loses EU Kit Kat trade mark tussle with Cadbury,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Nestle (NESN.S) has lost a tussle with rival Mondelez International (MDLZ.O) over the validity of its EU trade mark for the shape of the Kit Kat chocolate biscuit bar in an EU court which said it should be re-examined. Cadbury Schweppes - now owned by Mondelez International - asked the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) to declare the Kit Kat four fingers trade mark invalid in 2007. The EUIPO dismissed that application on the grounds that the Kit Kat shape had acquired “distinctive character” through its use. On Thursday the EU’s second-highest court annulled that dismissal. The EUIPO will have to re-examine whether the Kit Kat four fingers bar has acquired distinctive character through its use within all EU member states, not just across the EU generally, the General Court of the EU said in a statement. In 2006 the EUIPO registered the Kit Kat shape as a trade mark in sweets, bakery products, pastries, biscuits, cakes and waffles. The General Court, based in Luxembourg, said the EUIPO had not established use of the trade mark in bakery products, pastries, cakes and waffles. If a trade mark is registered for a category of goods which also has sub-categories, then it applies only to goods where it has been put to use, the court said. In addition, Nestle would have to prove that when it applied in 2002, its Kit Kat shape had already gained distinctive character through use in all 15 of the states that had joined the bloc by then.  It was not enough for Nestle “to show that a significant proportion of the relevant public throughout the EU, merging all the member states and regions, perceives a mark as an indication of the commercial origin of the goods designated by the mark,” the Court said. The Court said EUIPO had found that Kit Kat shape had acquired distinctive character in 10 countries - Denmark, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Sweden and the UK - but not in countries including Belgium, Ireland, Greece and Portugal. Nestle said it was pleased the court had acknowledged that the four finger-shape trade mark has acquired distinctiveness in 10 member states of the EU. “The four finger-shape has been used throughout the EU by Nestle for decades and is known by consumers as being KIT KAT,” the company said. “We continue to review the findings and consider our position.” Nestle has the option of appealing against the decision before the EU’s highest court within two months. (This version of the story corrects to show court annulled challenge against Kit Kat trade mark, not trade mark itself; adds Nestle comment) ",12152016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-court-nestle/nestle-loses-eu-kit-kat-trade-mark-tussle-with-cadbury-idUSKBN1441I4
291,MDLZ,3G will take another bite of Corporate America,"CHICAGO (Reuters Breakingviews) - The Brazilian billionaires at 3G Capital that turned Kraft Heinz and Anheuser-Busch InBev into mega-acquisition machines will dive back into the buying business in the coming year. Their next target should be Mondelez, the $66 billion food conglomerate that failed to coax chocolate-maker Hershey into a sale in 2016. A deal will require some unusual ingredients.     3G - co-founded by banker-turned-beer-magnate Jorge Paulo Lemann - gobbled up Heinz for $28 billion in 2013 with the help of Warren Buffett. Two years later, Lemann and his partners combined Heinz ketchup with Cheez Whiz with a $36 billion swoop on Kraft. Speculation about 3G’s next target heated up in early November after a Brazilian blog said it was raising up to $10 billion of fresh funds. Using the combined Kraft Heinz to swallow Mondelez, whose shares gained as much as 12 percent on Wednesday after a Swiss news report said a bid was in the works, would be a natural next step.     While the maker of Cadbury chocolates run by Irene Rosenfeld has been cutting costs since it was spun out of Kraft four years ago, it’s still not as profitable as its former parent. That would give 3G new fat to cut after it finishes stripping out $1.5 billion of merger-related savings at Kraft Heinz by the end of 2017.     It would be about a $100 billion mouthful, including assumed debt, supposing 3G paid a 30 percent premium. The equity required would be daunting: Kraft Heinz owners would have to fork over nearly $60 billion of it to keep combined net debt below five times EBITDA. If they use Kraft shares, 3G and Buffett - who today own just over half the firm - would end up with less than a third of the enlarged entity.     But they’d still be the biggest shareholders by a mile. And the financial rewards could be mouth-watering. 3G sought savings worth 6 percent of combined sales in the Kraft Heinz merger. Apply that to the 2017 revenue analysts are penciling in for Kraft Heinz and Mondelez, and the buyers could squeeze out over $3 billion more pre-tax income a year, worth more than $20 billion taxed and capitalized.     If Mondelez proves too rich, Kraft could seek out a smaller target. Buying cereal makers Kellogg or General Mills without racking up excessive debt would require a more manageable $12 billion and $22 billion of equity, respectively. But neither offers the scale of a Mondelez deal. Whichever way the cookie crumbles, 3G is poised to take another bite out of Corporate America.

292,MDLZ,Mondelez in $13 million SEC settlement tied to India payments,"(Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) agreed to pay $13 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that its Cadbury unit violated a federal anti-bribery law through efforts to expand a chocolate plant in Baddi, India. In a statement on Monday, Mondelez said it was pleased to reach the civil settlement, in which it neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. The accord resolves charges that Mondelez violated the internal controls and books-and-records provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. According to the SEC, Cadbury India paid a local businessman $90,666 in 2010 to work with government officials in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh and obtain licenses and approvals to add capacity at the Baddi plant, which was built in 2005. The SEC said Cadbury India’s books and records did not accurately reflect the nature of the businessman’s services, for which it received five invoices but had no written contract. It also said Cadbury India lacked FCPA adequate compliance controls to ensure how the payments were used. Mondelez ended its relationship with the businessman in October 2010, the SEC said. An SEC subpoena was issued four months later. The settlement also reflected Deerfield, Illinois-based Mondelez’s “extensive” remedial actions, including a review of Cadbury India’s relationships with third parties, the SEC said. Mondelez, known at the time as Kraft Foods, bought Cadbury in February 2010. Some of the company’s other products are Halls cough drops, Milka and Toblerone chocolate, Oreo cookies, Philadelphia cream cheese and Ritz and Triscuit crackers.

293,MDLZ,UPDATE 3-Mars to buy pet healthcare provider VCA for $7.7 bln,"(Reuters) - Candy and pet food conglomerate Mars Inc is buying veterinary hospital operator VCA Inc WOOF.O for $7.7 billion in a deal that will give the maker of Pedigree pet food an even bigger share of the $4 billion global pet healthcare market. The deal will help family-owned Mars, better known for candies such as M&Ms; and Snickers, add about 800 pet hospitals to its network of more than 900 clinics, which includes the 61-year-old Banfield pet hospital chain. McLean, Virginia-based Mars is already the biggest pet food company in the world - it held a quarter of the $71.77 billion global pet food market as of 2015 - followed by Nestle SA (NESN.S), the maker of the Purina cat and dog food brand. Mars and Nestle also hold the mantle of being the No.1 and No.3 confectionary makers in the world, respectively, according to Euromonitor data. Candy makers have been diversifying their business as calorie-conscious consumers increasingly shun sugary sweets, a trend that has weighed on the $183 billion global confectionery market. Rival Hershey Co (HSY.N) is also expanding beyond chocolates - it bought Krave, a beef jerky maker, in 2015, while Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) recently introduced Good Thins, its first snack brand in more than a decade. “While most of Mars Pet is focused on food, the firm had long dabbled in pet healthcare services,” Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang wrote in a note. “Considering that growth in pet healthcare has averaged 7-8 percent over the long term, the addition of VCA would help Mars tap into this appealing market.” Mars said it would offer $93 per share, a premium of 31.4 percent to VCA’s Friday closing price. Including debt, the deal is valued at $9.1 billion. VCA’s shares were up 19.8 percent at $90.60 in afternoon trading on Monday. The company, founded in 1986, had annual sales of $2.13 billion in 2015. Mars, which also owns the BluePearl chain of emergency and specialty veterinary care clinics, had annual pet food sales of $17.80 billion in 2015, according to Euromonitor data. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and BDT & Co were Mars’ financial advisers, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom provided legal advice. Barclays was VCA’s financial adviser and Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP and Potter Anderson Corroon LLP were legal advisers.

Bega Cheese (BGA.AX) will be the new owner of the spread following its deal to buy most of Mondelez International’s (MDLZ.O) grocery brands in Australia and New Zealand for A$460 million ($345 million).  The deal returns the salty, slightly bitter spread to full local ownership for the first time since 1926. Developed by a young Australian chemist from brewer’s yeast, Vegemite has a huge following of customers who have grown up with it and was famously referenced in the Men at Work song “Land Down Under”. “The wonderful heritage and values that Vegemite represents and its importance to Australian culture makes its combination with Bega Cheese truly exciting,” said Bega Cheese Executive Chairman Barry Irvin.  He described the deal, which includes other brands like Kraft peanut butter and Mac & Cheese, as “company making”. While the British favorite Marmite has a presence in the yeast-based spreads market in Australia, it is Vegemite that dominates it, with over 300,000 jars produced each day. It is found in 90 percent of Australian homes. Vegemite’s homecoming was applauded by Australians on social media too amid a climate of renewed vigor for Australian assets to be in local hands.  In 2016, the government blocked Chinese led-groups from buying cattle and pastoral group S. Kidman & Co, owner of the country’s largest private landholding. It was eventually sold to a consortium led by Australia’s richest woman, Gina Rinehart. Dick Smith, the owner of OzEmite, which is marketed heavily as a homegrown alternative to Vegemite, told Reuters he was “delighted” Vegemite was back in Australian hands. “I can’t wait for Arnott’s to be bought back and Aeroplane Jelly and Redheads Matches,” he said of other foreign-owned Australian favorites.  “Hopefully this is the start of buying back the farm so the wealth stays here for our children and grandchildren.” Bega said it would fund the deal initially with debt and it would be “strongly” accretive to earnings per share. Shares in the company rose more than 13 percent after news of the deal. Mondelez, a spin-off from Kraft Foods, said the sale would allow it to further focus on brands like Cadbury Dairy Milk, Oreo Biscuits and Philadelphia cream cheese.  Bega Cheese could not comment immediately on whether it would look at opportunities to extend the reach of the Vegemite brand.

The benchmark fell 0.4 percent in the previous session. “I think CSL’s upgrade is the main driver today, combined with some support from resources stocks,” said Bill Keenan, general manager of direct equities research at Lonsec. CSL Ltd, a global biotech company, jumped by up to 10.8 percent to its highest in more than four months, and recording its biggest intraday gain in close to 10 years.

Healthcare stocks rose as much as 5.4 percent to their highest in close to three months, while recording the biggest percentage gain since December 2008. Local miners rose significantly despite an overnight drop in Chinese iron ore futures, although they were supported by steadying copper prices. “I don’t think gains in basic material stocks today is commodity related. It is probably portfolio rebalancing into resources,” Keenan said. “I think they (investors) are just positioning themselves ahead of the earnings season.” BHP Billiton Ltd and Rio Tinto Ltd rose as much as 1.3 percent and 1.8 percent respectively, while Fortescue Metals Group Ltd rose by up to 2.8 percent.

The A$8.85 per-share offer is at a 24.8 percent premium to Warrnambool’s Friday closing price of A$7.09.  Shares in Warrnambool rose as much as 23.7 percent following the announcement, their biggest one day gain since September 2013. The stock was up 22 percent to A$8.65 a share by 0021 GMT. Saputo, which already owns 88.02 percent of Warrnambool shares, will fund the acquisition from cash on hand and existing credit facilities, the company in a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange. “Saputo have been aiming for full ownership but there has been that block stake there for a while,” said Michael Harvey, senior dairy analyst at Rabobank. Saputo acquired its majority stake in Warrnambool Cheese and Butter in 2014, beating local rivals Murray Goulburn Ltd and Bega Cheese Ltd in one of the Australia’s most hotly contested takeover battles.  Saputo’s offer is the latest in a series of M&A; deals in the Australian dairy industry this year.

308,MDLZ,Mondelez International to close NZ Cadbury factory,"WELLINGTON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - International food giant Mondelez International Inc said on Thursday it plans to shut its Dunedin Cadbury factory and shift production to neighbouring Australia, which takes most of New Zealand’s chocolate output. Staff were being consulted about plans to cut 250 jobs in the South Island town this year and another 100 in 2018, the company said in a statement. It was cheaper to use existing capacity in Australian factories to produce chocolate, given about 70 percent of the Dunedin factory’s output was shipped to Australia anyway. “We’re focused on becoming globally cost-competitive through increased production and investment in larger sites, while reducing costs,” said Amanda Banfield, Mondelez vice-president for Australia, New Zealand and Japan. About 130 New Zealand office staff in Cadbury’s commercial and finance operations would be unaffected. The eighty-year-old factory site would continue to host chocolate-themed tourist centre “Cadbury World”. Mondelez, a spin-off from Kraft Foods, in January announced it was selling iconic Australian spread Vegemite to Bega Cheese  to focus on brands like Cadbury Dairy Milk, Oreo Biscuits and Philadelphia cream cheese.

Since President Donald Trump vowed last week to announce a tax reform in the coming weeks, Wall Street has inched up to record intraday and closing highs for most of this week in a rally where financials, mainly banks, outperformed other sectors. But, with a strong fourth-quarter earnings season mostly complete, many investors say they need concrete signs of progress from Trump on his policy plans to justify more gains. “While the markets have continued to melt up a little in the past two weeks, I’m not seeing depth, volume or conviction of the market that is looking to break out higher,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US LLP. “If anything I think we are setting up for a period of profit taking, while forward-looking investors await more signs from the White House.” With a long weekend ahead due to the Presidents Day holiday on Monday, investors are unlikely to make too many new bets and trading volumes are likely to be thin. At 12:30 p.m. ET (1730 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 54.89 points, or 0.27 percent, at 20,564.88 and the S&P; 500 was down 3.7 points, or 0.15 percent, at 2,343.52. The Nasdaq Composite was up 4.47 points, or 0.08 percent, at 5,819.37, helped mainly by Kraft’s 7.6 percent jump to $93.95. Kraft said it would continue to pursue a $143 billion bid for Unilever, despite being rebuffed. Unilever’s U.S.-listed shares surged 11.6 percent. Ten of the 11 major S&P; sectors fell, with Kraft’s gains helping the consumer staples notch as gain of 0.36 percent. The S&P; 500 financial index, which has also gained on prospects of higher interest rates, was down 0.5 percent and the KBW Bank index fell nearly 0.46 percent. Energy stocks fell 0.75 percent as oil prices slipped. UnitedHealth sank 3.7 percent to $157.55 after it was sued by the Justice Department over Medicare charges. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,844 to 1,012. On the Nasdaq, 1,485 issues fell and 1,261 advanced.

310,MDLZ,UK PM May orders officials to examine Kraft Heinz bid for Unilever -FT,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May has asked top officials to examine U.S. food company Kraft Heinz’s (KHC.O) proposed takeover of Unilever Plc (ULVR.L), the Financial Times reported on Sunday without citing any sources. Kraft’s surprise $143 billion offer, which would be the largest ever acquisition of a UK-based company, was flatly rejected by Unilever on Friday. The Financial Times said May had ordered officials to see if the proposed deal raised any concerns for the wider British economy and merits government intervention. May’s office declined to comment on the report. The newspaper said the prime minister’s team had held talks with both Unilever and Kraft Heinz to see what the implications of its plans are for jobs, research and development, as well as for Unilver’s headquarters and operations in Britain. Detailed work will be led by Alex Chisholm, a top official in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, who will seek assurances from Kraft Heinz on its strategy, the newspaper reported. During her leadership campaign last year, May criticized Kraft’s 2010 takeover of British chocolate maker Cadbury, following which it reneged on an earlier promise to keep a factory in southwest England open.     May said then that while the government should not automatically stop the sale of British firms to foreign ones, it should be able to step in and defend important sectors.

The abrupt U-turn by U.S. foods giant Kraft at the weekend pushed the value of deals withdrawn this year to $205.2 billion, compared with $53.6 billion at the same point in 2016. The effect of proposed big deals on those numbers is clear, with the 87 deals to have collapsed this year significantly lower than the 111 that fell through in the corresponding period last year. The value of failed deals is likely to continue, bankers say, with companies still likely to seek ambitious acquisitions.  “There has been no punishment by the market or investors if a deal does not close. The overall context has been shareholder support for trying to get deals done and that has been an engine of growth in the M&A; market,” said Severin Brizay, head of M&A; for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Swiss bank UBS (UBSG.S) Kraft had pursued Unilever as part of its strategy to become a global consumer goods giant, but it received a hostile reception from the Anglo-Dutch company and cited a lack of “strategic” merit for its withdrawal from a deal that would have had a value of $162.2 billion based on the offer price plus Unilever’s debt. Yet the complexity of such huge deals can throw up multiple obstacles. The biggest withdrawn deal came last April when U.S. drugmaker Pfizer’s (PFE.N) attempt to buy Ireland-based Allergan  (AGN.N) for $160 billion floundered on the introduction of U.S. Treasury rules to curb tax-cutting inversion deals. Honeywell International’s (HON.N) attempt to buy United Technologies for $90.7 billion ended in failure last February after United Tech rejected the deal on expectations that it would be blocked by antitrust regulators.  Those helped to lift the value of withdrawn deals last year to an eight-year high, with transactions worth $808 billion withdrawn or rejected, compared with $538 billion in 2015.

314,MDLZ,UPDATE 2-Unilever spurred into speedy value review by Kraft bid," LONDON (Reuters) - Unilever (ULVR.L) sought to show shareholders it can go it alone on Wednesday after rejecting Kraft Heinz’s (KHC.O) $143 billion bid, with the promise of a swift, far-reaching review.  This should be completed by early April and could lead to asset sales and cost cuts, a source close to the Anglo-Dutch company said only days after it roundly dismissed Kraft’s approach as without financial or strategic merit.  ""The events of the last week have highlighted the need to capture more quickly the value we see in Unilever,"" the ice cream-to-shampoo producer said in a statement announcing the ""comprehensive"" review of the business.  The board-led review would include possible mergers or acquisitions and a spin-off of the group’s food business would not be excluded, the source close to Unilever said.  Shares in Unilever, which had hit record highs on Friday when Kraft’s approach became public, rose 3 percent. This recouped some of the losses that followed Kraft’s retreat on Sunday, but was still below the $50 offer price.  Kraft, backed by Warren Buffett and private equity firm 3G, had wanted to buy Unilever, which is being advised by Centerview following the approach, as part of its strategy of buying competitors and cutting costs to drive profits.  Unilever’s own profitability has been under scrutiny following weakness in some of the emerging markets where it has developed a strong presence and the group responded on Wednesday by saying it expected its 2017 core operating margin to be towards the upper end of its 40-80 basis points guidance.  Under its Dutch chief executive Paul Polman, Unilever has extolled the virtues of organic growth and focused on “sustainability”, but since it rejected Kraft’s proposal some shareholders have asked why it spurned the bid and called on the company for reassurance over its growth plans.  Others fund managers are more supportive, including Ketan Patel of EdenTree Investment Management who said:  “As long-term shareholders we welcome the decision by Unilever to reject the bid by Kraft Heinz, which offers very little financial incentive and poses a threat to the sustainability focused business model developed by Unilever’s CEO, Paul Polman, since he took over in 2009.”  The review is likely to look at the firm’s cost base and its structure, including whether there is an advantage in producing food and personal and home care products.  Top of the shopping list for any spin-off could be Unilever’s foods business, a second source told Reuters, although a top-30 Unilever shareholder said that would not be an easy fix to the growth conundrum in household and personal care.  “There are some that argue that a sale of some or all food assets is on the cards in exchange for a larger deal in HPC. Unilever would have at least a willing buyer in Kraft. The problem may be what to buy in HPC,” the shareholder said  Unilever’s London-listed shares were up 4.4 percent at 37.44 pounds ($46.64) at 1502 GMT, just below where they were trading on Friday when news of the Kraft approach broke.  “The shares have delivered total returns of over 12 percent per annum over the past decade, more than double that of the FTSE 100 over the same period,” EdenTree Investment Management’s Patel said on Wednesday.  One of those to buy into the stock following the Kraft bid on an expectation that Unilever would have to react was Henderson Global Investors fund manager John Bennett.  “I think Unilever should use this as an opportunity to reexamine the portfolio and ask itself ‘why should it remain a conglomerate of food and consumer and household products’?  “It might have a very good reason to, but it should present those reasons to shareholders,” Bennett said.

316,MDLZ,UPDATE 2-Kraft's shock bid triggers Unilever focus on short-term value,"(Reuters) - Kraft Heinz’s (KHC.O) bid has jolted Unilever (ULVR.L) into focusing more on delivering on its strategy in the short-term, the Anglo-Dutch company’s finance chief said on Friday. Graeme Pitkethly said Kraft’s offer had highlighted the importance of achieving a balance between long-term sustainable value, which it had prioritized, and short-term delivery. “This has certainly been a trigger moment for Unilever, and we will not waste it,” he said at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference in Boca Raton, Florida, in a presentation streamed on its website. The U.S. company walked away from a fight with Unilever on Sunday, just two days after its $143 billion bid - and Unilever’s rejection - was made public. Kraft, which is backed by Warren Buffett and the private equity firm 3G, wanted to buy Unilever as part of its strategy to become a leading consumer goods giant by buying competitors and cutting costs and jobs to drive profits.  The approach caused Unilever, which makes OMO detergent and Magnum ice cream, to announce a far-reaching review on Wednesday, seeking to show shareholders it could realize the value spotted by its rival. Pitkethly said he believed Unilever could do more to communicate the value buried within its existing plans, while the review would look at options for the group’s portfolio, organization, cost structures, balance sheet and use of cash.  He said Kraft had taken advantage of a recent widening gap between Unilever’s share price and the sector average, caused in part by a weak outlook for markets like India and Brazil.  “The combination of being at the bottom of the emerging market cycle combined with a lack of volume growth in the fourth quarter led to a very weak Unilever share price,” he said. “Add to this that we were at the bottom of credit cycle and our own strong balance sheet, and you have the opportunity for a leveraged offer.” Unilever, which has struggled recently amid slowing growth and currency fluctuations, saw its shares tumble 4.5 percent on Jan. 26, its worst day in nearly a year, when the company reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter sales.  Kraft seized the opportunity to make an approach pitched at $50 a share, representing a premium of 18 percent. Pitkethly said for most of the last year, a $50-a-share bid would have represented a premium of about 10 percent. Unilever’s shares jumped to an all-time high of 38.48 pounds when the approach was made public, and they have retained most of that gain, supported by Unilever’s review and an upgrade to its guidance. The shares were trading up 0.2 percent at 37.73 pounds  ($47.14) at 1534 GMT on Friday. Pitkethly said the bid “substantially undervalued” Unilever, while Kraft’s approach to shareholder value was diametrically opposed to its own.  While Unilever had an “inherently sustainable” model of  looking to grow by compounding returns and investment over the long term, Kraft, he said, relied on leverage to generate stronger short-term growth and earnings. But without the foundation of strong organic growth, Kraft would be dependent on further deals.      “It may be there was a strong strategic rational for Kraft in combining with Unilever, but there was no strategic rationale for Unilever,” he said.

319,MDLZ,Buffett says no backup deal for Kraft after Unilever snub - CNBC,"LONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - U.S. food company Kraft Heinz  is not targeting any other large deals for now after being snubbed by Unilever because valuations in the sector are too high, major shareholder Warren Buffett told CNBC news on Monday. “There isn’t any back-up deal. That was the only one that certainly I seriously thought about that made sense,” the billionaire investor told the cable television network. “Will there be another deal at Kraft Heinz someday? My guess is yes, but who knows when ... it would have to be friendly and frankly, the prices in that field make it very, very, very tough to make an intelligent deal,” Buffett said in a wide-ranging interview at a gathering in his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway , and private equity firm 3G Capital together own 50.9 percent of Kraft. They built the company into the world’s fifth-largest food and drinks firm through acquisitions and a relentless drive to boost profits through aggressive cost cuts. But with sales stagnating and margins flattening, analysts and investors have been expecting another major deal to reignite growth, though its choice of Anglo-Dutch consumer goods firm Unilever came as a surprise. Kraft Heinz withdrew its offer for Unilever on Feb. 19, two days after it disclosed the proposal following reports about an approach for the maker of Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream. “When I was called by a representative of Unilever on Saturday, I said ‘if this is regarded as hostile or unfriendly, you don’t have to worry about it, there isn’t any offer’,” he said, stressing that Kraft never intended to go hostile. He said Alex Behring, managing partner of 3G Capital and Kraft chairman, met Unilever Chief Executive Paul Polman in London on two occasions and presented a letter outlining a plan to create a global consumer goods giant at the end of the second visit after interpreting Polman’s initial response as “neutral”. “Alex took it as a maybe and gave this letter outlining a deal to Unilever,” Buffett said in the interview, noting that once he, Behring and 3G’s co-founder Jorge Paulo Lemann understood Unilever was against a deal, they dropped it. “Once the three of us learned that it was regarded as unfriendly, we had no intention of making one and I think the Unilever people understand that now,” Buffett said.

320,MDLZ,Fitch Rates Mondelez's $1.5B 364-Day Facility 'BBB',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to the new  $1.5 billion 364-day facility being issued by Mondelez International, Inc.  (Mondelez).  The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch also affirmed its Long-Term Issuer Default  Rating Rating and Short-Term IDR at 'BBB'/F2'. A full list of rating actions  follows at the end of this release. Mondelez has secured a new $1.5 billion 364-day credit facility due February  2018. This facility is in addition to Mondelez's existing $4.5 billion credit  facility due October 2021. The total $6 billion will backstop commercial paper  (CP) borrowings. Mondelez ended 2016 with $2.4 billion in CP borrowings. The new 364-day facility is similar in terms to the outstanding $4.5 billion,  multi-year credit facility.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Increased Confidence in 2018 EBIT Margin Target of 17%-18%: The ratings reflect Fitch's expectation that Mondelez can achieve its target to  improve EBIT margins from 15.6% in 2016 to 17%-18% in 2018 on 1%-2% annual  organic revenue growth. The improvement will primarily be driven by the large  restructuring program the company put in place in 2014 to realize $1.5 billion  in annualized savings by 2018 in the areas of supply chain, overhead costs, and  other organizational efficiencies. Free cash flow (FCF; after dividends, cash  restructuring charges, and pension contribution) is expected to improve from  approximately $520 million in 2016 to over $1.4 billion in 2018, as the company  cycles heavy restructuring-related cash payments and capex over the next 2-3  years. Debt/EBITDA is expected to improve from 3.5x in 2016 to 3.3x in 2018 and  trend toward 3.2x by 2019, primarily as a result of EBITDA growth.  Risks to the ratings include prolonged weakness in organic sales growth, with  Mondelez growing below industry-category sales and higher than expected  investments needed to drive sales which would preclude the company from  achieving the targeted EBIT margins. Debt-financed share buybacks and M&A;  activity that keeps leverage elevated in the mid-to-high 3x range are also  rating concerns. Fitch expects M&A; activity to continue in the packaged food  sector as companies optimize product portfolio, geographic exposure, and seek  cost reduction opportunities. While Mondelez's rating does not factor in a major  M&A; event, the company could be acquisitive or even the target of a larger  multi-national food company over the rating horizon. Favorable Portfolio Mix Fitch views Mondelez as having a favorable product mix relative to its  packaged-food peers given that 85% of its sales are geared towards snacks, which  Fitch expects should grow in the 2%-3% range going forward (versus 6%  historically) against flat to 1% for overall packaged foods. The snacking  category is well-aligned with consumer trends of eating more frequent, smaller  meals, and convenience. In addition, 40% of its sales come from emerging markets  which have near-term headwinds but strong growth prospects longer term. This  supports long-term organic growth of 1%-2%, which Fitch expects will be driven  equally by volume growth and pricing over the medium term.  Mondelez is one of the world's largest snack companies, with 2016 revenues of  approximately $26 billion and an attractive portfolio of sweet snack brands. The  company operates in approximately 165 countries and has #1 global market shares  in biscuits and candy, as well as #2 global shares in chocolate and gum. Oreo,  Cadbury, Nabisco, Dairy Milk, LU, Milka, and Trident each generate more than $1  billion in annual sales. Power Brands, which make up approximately 70% of sales,  are the company's fastest growing and highest-margin global and regional brands.  These brands have grown at about twice the pace of overall sales during the past  few years and have margins 100bps-200bps higher than the company's other brands.  Power Brands also receives about 80% of advertising and consumer (A&C;)  expenditures. Restructuring Program to Yield Industry Level Margins Management has been focused on improving efficiency, since Mondelez was created  through a series of acquisitions made by legacy Kraft that were never properly  optimized or integrated. In 2014, the company announced a $3.5 billion  restructuring program to be executed from 2014 through 2018 with $2.5 billion in  cash costs. The purpose is to reduce supply chain and overhead costs by $1.5  billion by the end of 2018. This would be supported by an incremental $1.6  billion in capex to upgrade manufacturing facilities. The company expects 70% of  its Power Brand sales will move to upgraded facilities by 2018, versus 25% in  2015.  EBIT margin has improved steadily to 15.6% in 2016 versus 12.5% in 2013. Fitch  views Mondelez's margin target of 17%-18% in 2018 as achievable, and would bring  Mondelez more in line with industry averages.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's assumptions in its base case projections are as follows: --Organic growth of about 1% in 2017 and 1.5% thereafter split equally between  volume/mix and pricing. Currency impact is assumed to be a negative 0.5% in the  first half of 2017 and neutral thereafter. --EBIT margin is expected to improve to 16.3% in 2017 from 15.6% in 2016, and  then expand to 17%-18% in 2018. --EBITDA margin is expected to be 19.4% in 2017, versus 18.8% in 2016, and then  expand to 20%-21% in 2018. --Capex peaked in 2015 at $1.5 billion and declined to $1.2 billion in 2016.  Capex is expected to trend slightly lower and come in under $1.1 billion by 2018  as restructuring-related capex continues to decline.  --FCF (after dividends, cash restructuring charges, and pension contribution)  improving from $520 million in 2016 to over $1.4 billion in 2018. --Total debt-to-EBITDA is expected to decline from 3.5x in 2016 to 3.3x in 2018  and further to 3.2x in 2019, driven primarily by EBITDA growth. This improvement  assumes incremental debt (in the form of CP borrowings) will partially fund  share buybacks.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: --EBITDA tracks below expectation due to a shortfall in expected operating  margin improvement or deceleration in organic top-line growth, aggressive  financial policies or engaging in a large debt-financed acquisition, such that  leverage is consistently above 3.5x.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include: --Organic growth in line with or better than category growth; --EBITDA margins in line with or better than industry average; --Leverage consistently below 3x. LIQUIDITY Mondelez's liquidity at Dec. 31, 2016 included more than $1.7 billion in cash  and equivalents and an undrawn $4.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit  facility expiring in October 2021. Mondelez had $2.4 billion in CP outstanding  at Dec. 31, 2016, which was backstopped by the $4.5 billion credit facility.  Upcoming long-term debt maturities include approximately $0.7 billion due in  2017, which Fitch believes the company is likely to refinance with increased CP  borrowings. FCF (after dividends, cash restructuring charges, and pension  contribution) is expected to improve from $520 million in 2016 to over $1.4  billion in 2018 as the company cycles heavy restructuring-related cash payments  and capex moderates over the next 2-3 years. Debt/EBITDA is expected to trend  toward 3.2x by 2019 from 3.5x in 2016 on EBITDA growth.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has assigned the following rating: Mondelez International, Inc. --$1.5 billion 364-day credit facility at 'BBB'. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Mondelez International, Inc. --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB';  --Short-Term IDR at 'F2'; --$4.5 billion credit facility due Oct. 21 at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'.

323,MDLZ,Hershey and its trust tap new board members,"(Reuters) - Hershey Co (HSY.N) and the trust that control it disclosed on Thursday they would fill positions on their respective boards following a year marked by an acquisition overture from Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) and a series of resignations.  Chocolate maker Hershey rejected a $23 billion bid last summer from Oreo cookie owner Mondelez, as the Hershey Trust, which can veto a deal, was embroiled in a row with its overseer that resulted in departures at the trust and Hershey’s board. The Hershey Trust is adding James Katzman, a retired Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) partner, to its ranks, bringing onboard a seasoned investment banking professional at a time when investors are speculating over whether Hershey would entertain a new offer in the near term following Mondelez’s approach. Also joining as Hershey trustees are Melissa Peeples-Fullmore, a Milton Hershey School alumnus and education professional, and Jan Loeffler Bergen, a trained social worker and chief executive officer of non-profit health provider Lancaster General Health. Hershey disclosed it was nominating two new members to its board, Diane Koken and James Brown, who also sit on the Hershey Trust board. Michele Buck became Hershey’s new CEO on March 1. The Hershey Trust was set up by Hershey founder Milton Hershey over a century ago to fund and run a school for underprivileged children. After being criticized by its overseer, the Pennsylvania attorney general, for poor governance and excessive expenses and compensation, it struck an accord that led to three board resignations last year. Two of the retiring Hershey Trust board members - Robert Cavanaugh and James E. Nevels - also held positions on the Hershey board and were not nominated for reelection this year. [L1N1A81UM] In its agreement with the attorney general, the Hershey Trust said it will use its “best effort” to increase board size to 13, up from nine at the time of the accord. With two more board members set to retire at the end of this year, that leaves a total of six potential slots left to be filled.  The Hershey trust owns close to a third of Hershey, but the company accounts for more than two-thirds of its investment holdings.  It put up Hershey up for sale in 2002, citing a need to diversify its investments. The process attracted a $12.5 billion offer by chewing gum maker Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. But that deal was abandoned after the Pennsylvania attorney general successfully petitioned a court to block the offer amid opposition from the local community.

325,MDLZ,"Galvanised by Kraft, Unilever keeps shareholders sweet with cash","LONDON (Reuters) - Unilever  promised shareholders a multi-billion euro rewards package on Thursday after February’s $143 billion takeover offer from Kraft Heinz jolted it into a corporate makeover aimed at proving it can go it alone. The maker of Dove soap and Knorr soup said it would speed up cost savings, sell its shrinking margarines business and decide whether to scrap its dual Anglo-Dutch listing, which Unilever said would make it easier to do big acquisitions. Shareholders, some of whom where unhappy that Unilever so swiftly spurned the approach by U.S. rival Kraft, will also get a 5 billion euros ($5.3 billion) share buyback, the first since 2008, funded in part by a targeted rise in debt levels, and a 12 percent dividend increase this year. Unilever, one of Europe’s biggest blue-chip stocks, called the Kraft episode a “trigger moment” to deeply review its business, as global packaged goods makers face slowing growth and more competition from start-ups exploiting evolving tastes for natural and healthy products. “There is no doubt that however ... opportunistic it (the Kraft approach) was, it did raise expectations,” Chief Executive Paul Polman said. “We are absolutely determined to use it as an opportunity to place Unilever on an even stronger footing.” Unilever’s London-listed shares, which have held onto the gains made by the Kraft bid as shareholders bet it would spur improved performance, closed up 1 percent at 39.78 pounds, while the FTSE 100 was down 0.3 percent. “They’re not stretching here, and nor should they. They’re in a very strong position and this is hopefully a sign they’re going to be a bit leaner and more shareholder-focused,” said GAM fund manager Ali Miremadi, who manages two worldwide equity funds that are 2.5 percent invested in Unilever. Unilever should be able to deliver the premium Kraft was offering or more over the next four or five years, he added. Unilever set a 20 percent underlying operating margin target for 2020, up from 16.4 percent in 2016, fueled by increased cost savings, which Goldman Sachs analysts said suggested 90 basis points of expansion per year, up from a prior goal of 40 to 80 points. But unlike the previous target, the new one excludes restructuring charges, which are seen totaling 3.5 billion euros over the period. Unilever is now aiming for 6 billion euros of savings by 2019, up from 4 billion euros and said it would double savings within brand and marketing to 2 billion euros. Goldman, which has a “sell” rating on the shares, worries that reduced marketing spend will hurt sales, but Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said Unilever could cut the number of advertisements it makes by a third and the number of agencies it works with by half with little effect. Much of the improvement would come from combining food, which includes Knorr and Hellmann’s mayonnaise, with the ice cream and tea businesses, following the sale or spin-off of the spreads unit, where sales have fallen for years. Unilever already has interest from private equity firms, who sources estimate may pay some 6 billion euros, but if a sale does not generate enough value it will pursue a spin-off and aims to complete the process by year-end. In another strategic shift, Unilever said it will take on debt equal to 2 times core earnings, whereas its leverage ratio has been below one time for more than half of the past 20 years, Jefferies analysts have said. “Unilever was vulnerable to a takeover exactly because it’s been so free of debt,” said Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital in London. Unilever said the leverage will help it grow. “We think there will be a lot more action in the M&A; pipeline ... and as ever we look forward to participating very actively,” Pitkethly told Reuters. While Polman signalled a potential interest in buying French’s mustard and Frank’s RedHot sauce, which are being sold by Reckitt Benckiser and which sources say could fetch a price around $3 billion, Unilever has generally been selling food brands and buying higher-growth home and personal care. Analysts have long speculated whether Unilever may divest its food business, which makes up some 40 percent of revenue, and do a blockbuster personal care deal. “Colgate (Palmolive) is the stand out option on this front,” Exane BNP analyst Jeff Stent said, adding that Unilever’s comments on Thursday may signal more openness. Colgate has a market valuation of $65 billion and analysts expect a deal would need to be in the area of $90 billion. Unilever executives said it still made sense to keep its food business, excluding spreads, although they left the door open for big-ticket deals, by touting how much easier they would be if it ditched the dual listings and headquarters in London and Rotterdam, as a single listing would make it easier to spin off businesses and use equity in a share deal. “With the fast changes we see in the market we will see opportunities come and go quicker than they probably did in the past, and we need to be prepared,” Polman said. Unilever will decide by the end of the year whether to combine its dual listing and headquarters, adding that Brexit would not influence its choice.

332,MDLZ,"Mondelez's results beat on better pricing, cost cuts","(Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and sales, helped by cost cuts, strong sales of its chocolate brands such as Cadbury Dairy Milk and Milka, and better product pricing mainly in Latin America. Shares of the world’s No. 2 confectionary company rose 3.3 percent to $45.17 in after-hours trading on Tuesday. Mondelez’s Latin America net revenue, which accounts for about 14 percent of total sales, increased 11.4 percent in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with the year-ago period. Net sales from the company’s main brands, such as Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka chocolate and Oreo cookies, rose 1.6 percent in the quarter. However, total revenue declined, hit by lower volume growth for biscuits in North America, Mondelez’s second-biggest market, a strong dollar, and changing consumer tastes. Mondelez has also been launching products such as GOOD THiNS crackers and herb-infused Vea biscuits in the United States to cater to consumers who prefer less-processed, organic foods over high-calorie, sugary snacks.

333,MDLZ,"UPDATE 2-Mondelez's results beat on better pricing, cost cuts","(Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and sales, helped by cost cuts, strong sales of its chocolate brands such as Cadbury Dairy Milk and Milka, and better product pricing mainly in Latin America. Shares of the world’s No. 2 confectionary company rose 3.3 percent to $45.17 in after-hours trading on Tuesday. Mondelez’s Latin America net revenue, which accounts for about 14 percent of total sales, increased 11.4 percent in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with the year-ago period. Net sales from the company’s main brands, such as Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka chocolate and Oreo cookies, rose 1.6 percent in the quarter. However, total revenue declined, hit by lower volume growth for biscuits in North America, Mondelez’s second-biggest market, a strong dollar, and changing consumer tastes. Mondelez has also been launching products such as GOOD THiNS crackers and herb-infused Vea biscuits in the United States to cater to consumers who prefer less-processed, organic foods over high-calorie, sugary snacks.

339,MDLZ,UPDATE 2-Amazon-Whole Foods deal hits shares across the food chain,"(Adds analysts’ comments, details on Amazon’s strategy, updates share prices) By Nandita Bose and Lewis Krauskopf CHICAGO/NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc’s proposed purchase of high-end food retailer Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion hammered share prices of food and retail companies on Friday as the proven retail disruptor stepped boldly into another consumer space. The deal, which not only helps Amazon make deeper inroads into the grocery sector but also marks its big entry into the brick-and-mortar retail space, sent shock waves through the retail industry. “Implications ripple far beyond the food segment, where dominant players like Walmart ... and Target now have to look over their shoulders at the Amazon train coming down the tracks,” said Charlie O’Shea, retail analyst with Moody’s. RBC Capital Markets said in a note the deal is surprising because the acquisition would be Amazon’s largest to date by a factor of 10, and also because the online retailer has so far avoided having much of a physical presence. Amazon had established a tentative physical footprint with a small number of Amazon Book Stores. Shares of U.S., Canadian and European retailers and supermarket chains fell as investors fretted over the wide-reaching implications of the deal. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc were down 4.4 percent at $75.46 on Friday afternoon, while Target Corp shares were down 7.1 percent at $51.53. Supermarket chain Kroger Co was off 12.1 percent at $21.60, United Natural Foods Inc tumbled 8.6 percent to $36.35 and Sprouts Farmers Market Inc was down 5.8 percent at $21.13. The S&P; 1500 food and staples retailing index was off 4.3 percent. The fallout also spread to Europe. Shares of supermarket chain Tesco Plc were down 4.8 percent and Carrefour slipped 3.7 percent. “Amazon’s got its tentacles everywhere and that’s another place to go,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at R.W. Baird & Co in Sarasota, Florida. “Amazon sees that industry changing significantly – and they see that people don’t necessarily go to the grocery store anymore.” Amazon shares were up 2.8 percent at $991.35 and Whole Foods shares were up 28.6 percent at $42.51 in afternoon trading. Canadian consumer staples stocks fell as much as 3.36 percent, their biggest fall since October 2008. Two of Canada’s largest grocery chain operators, Loblaw Companies Ltd and Metro Inc both fell more than 5.5 percent at one point. Packaged food companies were also damaged by the specter of healthier food that is less expensive targeting their customer base. Shares of Mondelez International Inc, the owner of Oreo cookies and the whole Nabisco brand, were down 1.1 percent while Kraft Heinz Co dropped 2.6 percent and Hershey Co was down 2.5 percent. Food distributors were also punished, with the S&P; 1500 sector index down 3.9 percent and Sysco Corp down 3.5 percent at $53.57.

342,MDLZ,UPDATE 1-New computer virus spreads from Ukraine to disrupt world business,"FRANKFURT/MOSCOW/KIEV (Reuters) - A new cyber virus spread from Ukraine to wreak havoc around the globe on Wednesday, crippling thousands of computers, disrupting ports from Mumbai to Los Angeles and halting production at a chocolate factory in Australia. The virus is believed to have first taken hold on Tuesday in Ukraine where it silently infected computers after users downloaded a popular tax accounting package or visited a local news site, national police and international cyber experts said. More than a day after it first struck, companies around the world were still wrestling with the fallout while cyber security experts scrambled to find a way to stem the spread. Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) said it was struggling to process orders and shift cargoes, congesting some of the 76 ports around the world run by its APM Terminals subsidiary. U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp (FDX.N) said its TNT Express division had been significantly affected by the virus, which also wormed its way into South America, affecting ports in Argentina operated by China’s Cofco. The malicious code locked machines and demanded victims post a ransom worth $300 in bitcoins or lose their data entirely, similar to the extortion tactic used in the global WannaCry ransomware attack in May. More than 30 victims paid up but security experts are questioning whether extortion was the goal, given the relatively small sum demanded, or whether the hackers were driven by destructive motives rather than financial gain. Hackers asked victims to notify them by email when ransoms had been paid but German email provider Posteo quickly shut down the address, a German government cyber security official said. Ukraine, the epicenter of the cyber strike, has repeatedly accused Russia of orchestrating attacks on its computer systems and critical power infrastructure since its powerful neighbor annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014. The Kremlin, which has consistently rejected the accusations, said on Wednesday it had no information about the origin of the global cyber attack, which also struck Russian companies such as oil giant Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and a steelmaker. “No one can effectively combat cyber threats on their own, and, unfortunately, unfounded blanket accusations will not solve this problem,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. ESET, a Slovakian company that sells products to shield computers from viruses, said 80 percent of the infections detected among its global customer base were in Ukraine, with Italy second hardest hit with about 10 percent. The aim of the latest attack appeared to be disruption rather than ransom, said Brian Lord, former deputy director of intelligence and cyber operations at Britain’s GCHQ and now managing director at private security firm PGI Cyber. “My sense is this starts to look like a state operating through a proxy ... as a kind of experiment to see what happens,” Lord told Reuters on Wednesday. While the malware seemed to be a variant of past campaigns, derived from code known as Eternal Blue believed to have been developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), experts said it was not as virulent as May’s WannaCry attack. Security researchers said Tuesday’s virus could leap from computer to computer once unleashed within an organization but, unlike WannaCry, it could not randomly trawl the internet for its next victims, limiting its scope to infect. Bushiness that installed Microsoft’s (MSFT.O) latest security patches from earlier this year and turned off Windows file-sharing features appeared to be largely unaffected. There was speculation, however, among some experts that once the new virus had infected one computer it could spread to other machines on the same network, even if those devices had received a security update. After WannaCry, governments, security firms and industrial groups advised businesses and consumers to make sure all their computers were updated with Microsoft (MSFT.O) security patches. Austria’s government-backed Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) said “a small number” of international firms appeared to be affected, with tens of thousands of computers taken down. Security firms including Microsoft, Cisco’s (CSCO.O) Talos and Symantec (SYMC.O) said they had confirmed some of the initial infections occurred when malware was transmitted to users of a Ukrainian tax software program called MEDoc. The supplier of the software, M.E.Doc denied in a post on Facebook that its software was to blame, though Microsoft reiterated its suspicions afterwards. “Microsoft now has evidence that a few active infections of the ransomware initially started from the legitimate MEDoc updater process,” it said in a technical blog post. Russian security firm Kaspersky said a Ukrainian news site for the city of Bakhumut was also hacked and used to distribute the ransomware to visitors, encrypting data on their machines. A number of the international firms hit have operations in Ukraine, and the virus is believed to have spread within global corporate networks after gaining traction within the country. Shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), which handles one in seven containers shipped worldwide, has a logistics unit in Ukraine. Other large firms affected, such as French construction materials company Saint Gobain (SGOB.PA) and Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), which owns chocolate brand Cadbury, also have operations in the country. Maersk was one of the first global firms to be taken down by the cyber attack and its operations at major ports such as Mumbai in India, Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Los Angeles on the U.S. west coast were disrupted. Other companies to succumb included BNP Paribas Real Estate (BNPP.PA), a part of the French bank that provides property and investment management services. “The international cyber attack hit our non-bank subsidiary, Real Estate. The necessary measures have been taken to rapidly contain the attack,” the bank said on Wednesday. Production at the Cadbury factory on the Australian island state of Tasmania ground to a halt late on Tuesday after computer systems went down. Russia’s Rosneft, one of the world’s biggest crude producers by volume, said on Tuesday its systems had suffered “serious consequences” but oil production had not been affected because it switched to backup systems.

The introduction of security patches in the wake of the May attack that crippled hundreds of thousands of computers also helped curb the latest malware, though its rapid spread underlined concerns that some businesses have still failed to secure their networks from increasingly aggressive hackers. After WannaCry, governments, security firms and industrial groups advised businesses and consumers to make sure all their computers were updated with Microsoft security patches. Austria’s government-backed Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) said “a small number” of international firms appeared to be affected, with tens of thousands of computers taken down. A number of the international firms hit have operations in Ukraine, and the virus is believed to have spread within global corporate networks after gaining traction within the country. Shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk, which handles one in seven containers shipped worldwide, has a logistics unit in Ukraine. Other large firms affected, such as French construction materials company Saint Gobain and Mondelez International Inc, which owns chocolate brand Cadbury, also have operations in the country. Maersk was one of the first global firms to be taken down by the cyber attack and its operations at major ports such as Mumbai in India, Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Los Angeles on the U.S. west coast were disrupted. The company said on Wednesday it was unable to process new orders and its 76 terminals around the world were becoming increasingly congested. Other companies to succumb included BNP Paribas Real Estate , a part of the French bank that provides property and investment management services. “The international cyber attack hit our non-bank subsidiary, Real Estate. The necessary measures have been taken to rapidly contain the attack,” the bank said on Wednesday. Production at the Cadbury factory on the Australian island state of Tasmania ground to a halt late on Tuesday after computer systems went down. Russia’s Rosneft, one of the world’s biggest crude producers by volume, said on Tuesday its systems had suffered “serious consequences” but oil production had not been affected because it switched to backup systems.

A bid for Nestle’s U.S. portfolio — which includes regional mass-market brands such as Butterfinger, Crunch and 100 Grand — would appear to be a shift from Pladis’s stated strategy of focusing on the high end of the market, which is performing better than mid-tier brands. Nestle in June said it might sell its U.S. confectionery business, the latest evidence of pressure on the North American market following last year’s failed bid by Mondelez International for Hershey.

Shares of the world’s second largest confectionary company rose 4.9 percent to $41.20 in after-market trading on Monday. Mondelez’s organic revenue, a measure that excludes currency fluctuations, grew 3.2 percent in Europe and 5.4 percent in Latin America in the quarter that marks the end of Irene Rosenfeld’s tenure as its chief executive officer.   The company said its performance in Europe was helped by strong chocolate sales in Germany and the U.K. However, sales in North America, its second largest market, remains a concern for the packaged goods company.  Net revenue from North America rose 1.3 percent but lagged behind its smaller rival Hershey (HSY.N), which posted a 1.6 percent rise in sales in the region in October. North America is the only region performing below expectations but the company is confident in improving it in the future, Rosenfeld said in the earnings call. The company said McCain Foods CEO Dirk Van de Put will take over on Nov. 20 from Rosenfeld.  Rosenfeld’s departure comes after years of consistent decline in sales for Mondelez, which was formed from a spin-off of Kraft’s North America grocery business in 2012 - a move that she engineered.   The snack giant said on Monday it is recovering from last quarter’s cyber attack that hurt shipment volumes and has led to $100 million loss in revenue for the full year.   Total organic net revenue rose 2.8 percent in the quarter ended Sept. 30 and the recovery in shipment volumes contributed 0.6 percent to it. Organic net revenue from its key brands, such as Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka chocolate and Oreo cookies, rose 3.8 percent in the quarter, compared with a 2.5 percent rise, a year earlier.

368,MDLZ,Activist Peltz to CEOs: We'll work with you,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Nelson Peltz has a message for America’s corporate chiefs; when he calls they do not automatically have to fear for their jobs. Peltz’s $13 billion Trian Fund Management is widely regarded as one of the world’s most influential activist investment firms, holding board seats at companies from Wendys Co (WEN.O) to General Electric Co (GE.N). Unlike other activists who often unseat CEOs, Peltz, 75, told Reuters Breakingviews on Tuesday that he prefers to work alongside management in making companies like Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) and Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), raise sales, cut costs and earn more. And he worried how rivals’ tactics are impacting a sector of the investment world that has attracted newcomers who are eager to cash in on the riches industry veterans like Peltz and Carl Icahn have earned over the last decades. “The word activist has come to mean a fight, it has come to mean short term,” Peltz said, adding “We are really not that concerned about the next quarters numbers because we will be around for the next 28 of them.” In a wide ranging interview, he called the technical aspects of proxy voting “busted”, praised President Donald Trump for getting things done, and worried electronic commerce company Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) holds too much sway over prices for the goods it sells. But mostly he sought distinguish Trian by saying that the firm usually sticks around for seven years and brings an ownership mentality to the board room. Known for writing white papers full of suggestions, Peltz said he wants to work collaboratively with Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) chief David Taylor where he will join the board in March after a bitter, expensive and long fight for a seat. “What we do is come with a plan to make a company better. We never come with a plan to throw out the CEO or to embarrass anyone,” Peltz said. This is particularly noteworthy as CEOs at companies including Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N), Buffalo Wild Wings Inc BWLD.O and CSX Corp (CSX.O) exited in 2017 amid pressure from activist investors Bill Ackman, Mick McGuire and Paul Hilal. Peltz criticized how U.S. investors are required to elect boards, worrying about conflicts of interest at proxy advisory firms and how some big shareholders vote. “The proxy plumbing is busted,” he said.

371,MDLZ,"UPDATE 5-Coffee meets 7UP in Keurig, Dr Pepper Snapple deal","(Reuters) - Keurig Green Mountain has struck a deal worth more than $21 billion to combine with soda maker Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc (DPS.N) to form a North American drinks company with brands like Green Mountain Coffee, 7UP, Snapple and Sunkist. The latest in a five-year string of acquisitions by Keurig’s owner, Luxembourg-based JAB Holding Co, it creates an enlarged group with a wide range of hot and cold beverages, different ways to access customers and a bigger platform for further deals. “We have a really wide portfolio of brands, we’re able to address almost every consumer need in every format and ... to reach every point of sale,” Keurig Chief Executive Bob Gamgort told Reuters.   “If you want to win in the beverage industry you need a portion of your portfolio that gives you significant scale and then you need to be able to layer in higher growth segments,” he said.  Keurig will pay a special dividend of $103.75 per share to Dr Pepper Snapple shareholders, resulting in a cash payment of $18.7 billion. Those shareholders will also retain a 13 percent stake in the combined company to be called ‘Keurig Dr Pepper’. A 13 percent stake in Dr Pepper Snapple was worth more than $2.2 billion before the deal was announced. The company’s shares jumped 25 percent on Monday to $119.70 in New York.     Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj estimates the deal’s value at $26 billion to $27 billion. “From DPS’ perspective at this time it makes a lot of sense,” said Josh Blechman, director of capital markets at Exponential ETFs, which owns shares of Dr Pepper Snapple. “They needed to diversify their business line from sugary drinks, so I think that this is a really good deal.” The companies expect $600 million in cost-savings, and see opportunities to expand the business such as by selling coffee in bottles and in vending machines. Dr Pepper’s direct-to-store delivery model will be complemented by Keurig’s online presence and relationships with major supermarket chains. Bulking up is a way to boost efficiency in the business at a time when soft drink sales are falling as consumers cut down on sugar. “If your truck is becoming less full because volumes are declining, you should have other beverages to fill that spot,” said Bernstein’s Dibadj, who has predicted beer and soft drink tie-ups for the same reason. “The likelihood that Coke (KO.N) and Pepsi (PEP.O) will get bought has just gone up,” Dibadj said. That would mean a mega-deal, given those soft-drink giants have market values of more than $200 billion and $170 billion respectively. Keurig Green Mountain is the leading single-serve coffee company in the United States. It was taken over by JAB, the holding company of the German billionaire Reimann family, in 2016 for $13.9 billion.   JAB has been on an acquisition spree in recent years, with a string of restaurant deals including Au Bon Pain, Krispy Kreme and Panera Bread as well as several coffee businesses from niche brand Intelligentsia to controlling the international coffee operations of Mondelez International (MDLZ.O).  JAB and its partners will make an equity investment of $9 billion in the deal. Mondelez, now a major Keurig shareholder, will own about 13 percent to 14 percent of the combined company. Jefferies analysts said further deals by Keurig Dr Pepper are very likely, as the company pays down a debt load expected to be about $16.6 billion when the deal closes, scheduled for the second quarter.  The company expects to get its leverage to below three times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization within two to three years, while paying an annual dividend of 60 cents per share. Goldman Sachs was the lead financial adviser to Keurig and Credit Suisse advised Dr Pepper Snapple on the deal.

373,MDLZ,Oreo maker Mondelez's profit beats on higher demand for key brands,"(Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), the world’s No. 2 confectionary company, posted a quarterly profit that beat estimates on Wednesday, benefiting from strong demand for Cadbury Dairy Milk and Oreo cookies in Europe and growth in emerging markets. Revenue from Europe, its largest market, rose 5 percent and accounted for nearly 40 percent of total revenue. However, revenue from North America fell 0.6 percent, as its biscuits business was affected by malware-related losses. The snack giant was hit by a cyber attack last year that hurt shipment volumes, leading to a $100 million loss in revenue for the full year. “Since the malware incident last summer, our supply chain execution has been challenged (in North America),” newly-appointed Chief Executive Dirk Van de Put said on a post-earnings conference call on Wednesday.   “While we are making progress, returning to normal service levels is taking longer than anticipated,” he said. The East Hanover, New Jersey-based company said its net revenue rose to $6.97 billion, meeting analysts’ average estimate of $6.97 billion. Net income rose to $802 million, or 53 cents per share in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $93 million, or 6 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Mondelez earned 57 cents per share, just brushing past estimates of 56 cents. “Moving forward we believe that Mondelez needs to find a more permanent solution to their difficulties in North America,” said Anthony Riva, an analyst at GlobalData Retail.  The company said it expects double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth on a constant currency basis for 2018.  Mondelez also expects organic net revenue to increase 1 percent to 2 percent for 2018 and adjusted operating income margin of about 17 percent.

385,MDLZ,"UPDATE 3-Hedge funds wager on rising wages and inflation with consumer, materials shares","NEW YORK (Reuters) - In late 2017, several well-known hedge funds made bets on companies selling goods considered non-essential by consumers and on companies processing raw materials, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange commission published on Wednesday. Companies in the “consumer discretionary” sector can take advantage of rising wages and prices, meaning the hedge funds may be well placed even as inflation fears have sent U.S. stocks into retreat for much of the past two weeks. Tiger Management, run by billionaire investor Julian Robertson Jr., made broad bets on consumer discretionary stocks, with new positions in Papa John’s International Inc, Penske Automotive Group Inc, and Domino’s Pizza Inc.  Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn added 13 new positions in consumer discretionary companies, including stakes in amusement park company SeaWorld Entertainment Inc, photo printing service Shutterly Inc and department store Nordstrom Inc.  Pershing Square’s William Ackman made a new bet on sportswear maker Nike Inc, buying 5.8 million shares, late last year. He also increased his bet on snackfood maker Mondelez by 66 percent to own 23.3 million shares. And George Soros’ eponymous Soros Fund Management LLC took new stakes in retailers Overstock.com Inc and Target Corp as well as Netflix Inc, filings showed, becoming the third largest Overstock shareholder. U.S. wages in January logged their biggest annual increase since the end of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, meaning consumers may have more to spend, even though Labor Department figures on Wednesday showed consumer prices rose more than expected last month. In the past two weeks concerns that rising inflation will push the Federal Reserve to accelerate its forecast interest rate rises this year have erased the S&P; 500 stock index’s gains for the year, after a 5.6 per cent rise in January, the strongest performance for that month since 1997.   The quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers’ stock holdings, in the so-called 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision, are one of the few public ways of tracking what managers buy and sell.  Relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy carries some risk because the disclosures come 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions. Farallon Capital Management LLC, a $25.4 billion San Francisco-based fund founded by Tom Steyer, added new positions in materials companies Monsanto Co and Tronox Ltd, according to regulatory filings released on Tuesday. Third Point, run by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, also added a position in Monsanto in the quarter ended Dec. 31, according to filings. Shares of the agricultural company are up nearly 3.0 percent for the year to date, about two percentage points more than the benchmark S&P; 500 stock index. Overall, hedge funds have their highest exposure to commodities since 2012, according to a report by Credit Suisse.  Hedge funds posted an estimated 4.1 percent gain in January, the Credit Suisse report said, with the largest gains coming in positions in consumer discretionary and healthcare stocks.  “January’s record performance provided a buffer to February’s vol-inspired risk-off move,” said Mark Connors, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said in the note. “Managers appear to be weathering the storm well.”  The 13F filings also showed that managers expected healthcare stocks to trade higher during the last three months of 2017. A number added fresh positions before the sector came under pressure from the recent stock market volatility and from the move by Amazon.com Inc to team with Berkshire Hathaway Inc <BRKa.N > and JPMorgan Chase & Co to reduce employee healthcare costs. Leon Cooperman’s Omega Advisors listed a new position in Humana Inc,  which is working with private equity firms to buy Kindred Healthcare Inc. The stock has gained 8.0 percent this year, likely benefiting Jason Karp’s Tourbillion which bought in with 90,000 shares in the fourth quarter.  Brahman Capital bought nearly 10 million shares of Teva Pharmaceuticals not long after Kare Schultz was tapped to head the world’s biggest seller of generic drugs. Among notable activist investors, Carl Icahn increased his position in Xerox Corp by 56 percent.  Greenlight’s Einhorn, meanwhile, reduced his stake in General Motors Co by 25 percent. Einhorn unsuccessfully lobbied the carmaker to split its stock in 2017. Shares of the company are up 2.0 percent for the year to date.

391,MDLZ,"Nestle, other food groups likely suitors for GSK's Horlicks - sources","LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Food giants Nestle (NESN.S), Kraft Heinz (KHC.O) and Unilever (ULVR.L) are expected to bid for GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK.L) Horlicks health nutrition business, which could fetch more than $4 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. GSK has started a strategic review of Horlicks - a malt-based drink brand popular in India – and some of its smaller products, after buying Novartis (NOVN.S) out of their consumer healthcare venture for $13 billion on Tuesday. The main asset on the block is GSK’s 72.5 percent stake in its Indian subsidiary GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (GLSM.NS). The sources said the stake was worth $3.1 billion at current market prices but GSK wanted a premium in any sale. They estimated the consumer health nutrition business, which also has smaller operations in Nigeria and Bangladesh, could fetch more than $4 billion. Nestle, the world’s biggest packaged food company, has previously told GSK privately of its interest in Horlicks on several occasions, the people said. Nestle already owns the malt drink Milo, but it is not a big-seller in India. The Swiss company declined to comment. Unilever, the world’s largest tea company, and Kraft Heinz, which sells the powdered drinks Crystal Light and Kool-Aid, also declined to comment. Horlicks is more than 140 years old with origins dating back to 1873, when two British-born men, James and William Horlick, first founded a company in Chicago to manufacture the drink. It was introduced to India by Indian soldiers who had fought with the British Army in the First World War. Associated British Foods (ABF.L), which owns the malt drink brand Ovaltine, could look at the business to scale up in a key emerging market, the sources said, although the size of the GSK business could be a deterrent. An ABF spokesman declined to comment. The Indian business has an enterprise value of about 29 times core earnings, said one of the sources, meaning any deal premium will value it well above what many packaged food and drink brands fetch. The valuation is inflated by the high growth rates seen in the Indian market. Nestle and Unilever could purchase the asset through their local Indian subsidiaries, Nestle India (NEST.NS) or Hindustan Unilever (HLL.NS). Other potential suitors might include Coca-Cola (KO.N), PepsiCo (PEP.O), Suntory (2587.T), Mondelez International (MDLZ.O) and JAB, the coffee business owner that recently agreed to buy Dr Pepper Snapple, one of the sources said.

396,MDLZ,"Rising snack demand in Europe, emerging markets fuels Mondelez beat","(Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) topped Wall Street estimates for first-quarter profit and revenue on Tuesday, helped by strong demand for Oreo cookies and belVita biscuits in European and emerging markets. Sales in Europe, the company’s biggest revenue generator, jumped 14.4 percent, while emerging markets that include Latin America and Asia saw a 7.6 percent rise in sales. “We continue to see encouraging snacking category growth trends, especially in emerging markets,” said Chief Executive Officer Dirk Van de Put, who took over in November. Net sales from the company’s power brands, such as Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka chocolate and Oreo cookies, rose 8.2 percent to $5.14 billion. The snack maker’s shares, which have fallen over 9 percent this year, rose 1.3 percent to $39.50 in after-market trading. Mondelez, however, warned of pressures on adjusted operating profit margins in the second quarter due to rising commodity and freight expenses. U.S. packaged food companies are facing a spike in costs due to a dearth of drivers, new regulations and higher diesel prices. Rival chocolate maker Hershey Co (HSY.N) last week blamed higher commodity and freight costs for a cut in its full-year sales forecast. Sales in the Toblerone chocolate maker’s North America again fell, slipping 1.3 percent to $1.63 billion as consumers’ shift to healthier brands that contain no artificial ingredients or transfats. In a post-earnings analysts call, the CEO said the company expects gradual progress in North America to continue over the next few quarters. The company’s net revenue rose 5.5 percent to $6.77 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $6.65 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, Mondelez earned 62 cents a share, topping estimate of 61 cents.

401,MDLZ,Nestle and Starbucks strike $7.15 billion coffee licensing deal,"LOS ANGELES/LONDON (Reuters) - Swiss-based Nestle, the world’s largest food and beverage company, will pay Starbucks Corp $7.15 billion in cash for exclusive rights to sell the U.S. chain’s packaged coffees and teas around the world, tying a premium brand to Nestle’s global distribution muscle.  The agreement announced on Monday could rev up Starbucks’ roughly $2 billion business selling packaged Starbucks coffee, Teavana tea and other products through grocery stores and other retailers, including in China.  The alliance, which amounts to a licensing arrangement, frees Seattle-based Starbucks to focus on improving its mainstay U.S. cafe business, where traffic growth has stalled amid competition from fast-food chains and upscale coffee houses, while rapidly adding shops in China. Starbucks will use proceeds to increase planned stock buybacks to $20 billion from $15 billion through fiscal 2020. It said the deal would add to earnings per share by 2021.  The agreement also includes Starbucks-branded capsules for Nestle’s Nespresso and Dolce Gusto single-serve brewers, which should help Nestle curb sales of alternatives from other providers. Nestle expects the alliance to add to its earnings by 2019. It did not alter share buyback plans.  In addition to the cash payment, Starbucks will receive revenue from product sales and royalties. “This global coffee alliance will bring the Starbucks experience to the homes of millions more around the world through the reach and reputation of Nestle,” said Starbucks Chief Executive Kevin Johnson, calling the arrangement a brand amplifier. “That would have taken a lot of capital and years to build outside the U.S.,” John Culver, Starbucks’ group president for international and channel development, said on a conference call with analysts.  Nestle CEO Mark Schneider has made coffee a strategic priority as he tries to convince uneasy shareholders, including activist Third Point, that he can boost the sprawling group’s performance. “This is all about growth,” Schneider told analysts.  He said he expects the alliance to boost Nestle in North America and benefit Starbucks in China, which is Nestle’s second largest market.  Analysts agreed that the alliance could strengthen Nestle’s position as the world’s biggest coffee company in a fast-changing landscape. Rival JAB Holdings, a private investment firm of Europe’s billionaire Reimann family, narrowed the gap with Nestle with a recent series of acquisitions, including Peet’s Coffee & Tea and Keurig Green Mountain. In January, Nestle sold its U.S. confectionery business to Ferrero. It had been losing ground in the United States confectionery sector as rivals moved towards healthier products. Nestle, which will take on about 500 Starbucks employees, will not buy any industrial assets as part of the deal.     Shares in Nestle rose about 1.6 percent in Switzerland, while Starbucks shares slipped 0.4 to close at $57.45 in U.S. trading.  Coffee is popular with younger customers who have grown up with Starbucks and are willing to pay for exotic beans and specialty drinks that translate into richer profit margins than mainstream packaged food.     The agreement will strengthen Nestle’s position in the United States, where ranks fifth with less than 5 percent of the market. Market leader Starbucks has a 14 percent share, according to Euromonitor International.     Other big players are growing as well, including Italy’s Lavazza, which is now the world’s No. 3.      Nestle CEO Schneider last year identified coffee as an area  for investment.    It bought Texas-based Chameleon Cold-Brew in November and took a majority stake in Blue Bottle Coffee, a small upscale cafe chain, in September.    Starbucks, which in April reported a global drop in quarterly traffic to its established cafes, has been streamlining its business. It sold its Tazo tea brand to Unilever for $384 million and closed underperforming Teavana retail stores.     Starbucks plans to open 1,000 upscale Starbucks Reserve stores and a handful of Roastery coffee emporiums to take on high-end coffee rivals such as Intelligentsia Coffee & Tea and Blue Bottle.     Starbucks has long farmed out retail distribution of its packaged products, but the partnerships have not always been smooth.  Privately held Acosta Inc picked up that U.S. business in 2011 after Starbucks cited brand mismanagement and ended a 12-year relationship with Kraft Foods. The partnership with Kraft had been due to end in 2014, but Starbucks sought an early exit. It was later forced by an arbitrator to pay $2.76 billion to Kraft, which by then had split with the payment going to Mondelez International. Nestle is no stranger to partnering with rivals through licensing deals or joint ventures, having reached arrangements with General Mills’ and Hershey, among others.
