1,AMGN,Micromet signs cancer drug deal with Amgen,"Bangalore (Reuters) - Micromet Inc MITI.O said it signed a cancer-drug development deal with U.S. biotech giant Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) for up to 695 million euros ($1.01 billion) plus royalties and reimbursements.  “The latest deal with Amgen continues to be a testament to the potential of the BiTE (antibodies) platform, evidenced by the strong financial terms for drug candidates which currently do not even exist yet,” Roth Capital Partners analyst Joseph Pantginis wrote in a note.  Micromet’s antibodies, called BiTE, have earlier attracted attention of large drugmakers such as Sanofi (SASY.PA), Boehringer Ingelheim and Bayer Schering Pharma, which have entered into collaboration agreements with the biotechnology company.  The BiTE antibodies are designed to direct the body’s cell-destroying T cells to attack tumor cells. Micromet’s pipeline includes antibodies generated with its BiTE technology as well as conventional monoclonal antibodies.  Its lead drug candidate blinatumomab, a BiTE antibody, is currently in clinical trials for treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  The deal, which will fetch Micromet 10 million euros ($14.5 million) upon execution, is for research of certain antibodies against three undisclosed solid tumor targets. Amgen has the right to pursue the development and marketing of the antibodies against up to two of the targets.  If milestones in multiple indications and tumor types are achieved, Micromet will be eligible to get up to 342 million euros ($496.2 million) and double-digit royalties on worldwide net sales.  Micromet will be primarily responsible for the discovery and pre-clinical development of the antibodies, while Amgen will lead the clinical development, manufacturing and marketing.  Micromet shares were up 7 percent at $6.16 in morning trade on Monday on Nasdaq.  ",7112011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-micromet/micromet-signs-cancer-drug-deal-with-amgen-idUSTRE76A3FK20110711

3,AMGN,UPDATE 2-Amgen settles drug patent dispute with Teva," * Teva drugs could be launched in Nov 2013, at latest   * Settlement does not include financial payments  (Adds analyst comment, share price)  LOS ANGELES, July 15 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) will allow Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA) to sell drugs similar to Amgen’s Neupogen and Neulasta, used to fight infection in chemotherapy patients, in the United States as of November 2013.   Worldwide sales of the two drugs totaled $4.8 billion last year.   “While an incremental positive (for Amgen), this is generally in-line with prior commentary from Amgen and Teva,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said in a research note.   Shares of Amgen, which had fallen 1.1 percent to $55.05 in regular trading on Friday, were unchanged in afterhours activity.   Amgen said on Friday that Teva admitted in a U.S. District Court in Pennsylvania that Neutroval — a “biosimilar” version of Neupogen — infringes two Amgen patents, which are set to expire in 2013.   The court’s injunction extends until Nov. 10, 2013, after which Teva may sell Neutroval in the United States, Amgen said in a statement. Teva also agreed not to sell its longer-lasting version of the infection-fighting drug — called Neugranin — until the same date unless it first obtains a court decision that it does not infringe Amgen patents.   Amgen said the Teva drugs could be launched earlier if certain unexpected events occur, including the introduction of a similar product by a third party.   Teva has already been selling its version of Neupogen in several European countries.   The settlement terms do not include any financial payments, Amgen said.

4,AMGN,Amgen results beat Street; Xgeva sales strong,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), the world’s biggest biotechnology company, posted better-than-expected second-quarter earnings, boosted by strong sales of Xgeva, a drug that prevents fractures in patients with cancer that has spread to the bone.  The company also implemented its first quarterly dividend, 28 cents a share. Its stock was up 1.9 percent at $54.43 on Friday afternoon on the Nasdaq.  Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.37 a share in the second quarter. Analysts on average were expecting $1.28, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Net profit fell to $1.17 billion, or $1.25 a share, from $1.20 billion, or $1.25 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 4 percent to $3.96 billion, topping the average Wall Street forecast of $3.78 billion.  “Overall, we think the quarter was solid with very low expectations going into the second quarter,” Geoff Meacham, an analyst at JPMorgan, said in a research note.  U.S. sales of Xgeva totaled $73 million in the second quarter, up from $42 million in the first quarter, its first full quarter on the market.  Analysts on average expected U.S. sales of Xgeva, considered Amgen’s most important growth driver, of $66 million.  Christopher Raymond, an analyst at Robert W. Baird, sees Xgeva sales hitting at least $1.8 billion in 2014.  Sales of the osteoporosis drug Prolia, which has the same active ingredient as Xgeva, were $44 million in the second quarter, up from $27 million in the first quarter.  Sales of the company’s top-selling anemia drug Aranesp, which have been slowing following several years of safety concerns, fell 3 percent to $585 million. Sales of its older anemia drug Epogen fell 17 percent to $543 million.  In January, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the federal agency that administers Medicare and Medicaid, changed the way it pays physicians for services and medications provided to dialysis patients.  The changes, which involve paying a fixed amount to dialysis centers for a bundle of services that include medications, give doctors an incentive to reduce the amount of Epogen they use. To counteract that, CMS has initiated a quality improvement program, to be implemented next year, under which centers would be penalized if they provide sub-standard service.  But under a proposed CMS policy, facilities would no longer be penalized for cutting their use of Epogen. That would probably lead to a reduction in use of the drug. CMS’s proposal follows a decision by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June to add additional warnings to Epogen’s label. The drug is one of a class of drugs that have been linked, at higher doses, to an increased risk of cardiovascular problems and stroke.  Eric Schmidt, an analyst at Cowen & Company, said most investors believe the CMS proposal will take effect, even though Amgen will likely fight it.  The company’s chief executive, Kevin Sharer, told analysts on a conference call that the company plans to lobby hard against the proposal in Washington, D.C.  “I respect CMS’s point of view but I am also confident we have arguments on the patient side that are important,” he said. “We’ve been at this for 20 years and while I’m not predicting any outcome, this isn’t our first Rodeo.”  If the change takes effect, Amgen said it expects Epogen dose reductions this year of 20 to 25 percent, partially offset by patient population growth and higher prices. He said Amgen has built that into its earnings forecasts.  Previously, the company said it expected dose reductions in the mid-teens.  The company said it expects the majority of the dosing changes to be implemented by the end of 2011, with some residual impact in early 2012.  Sharer said Amgen has considered and rejected the idea of selling off its Epogen business.  “Despite the challenges this business has presented, it remains a very large contributor to revenues and income,” he said. “We’re not wedded to any given business, but our judgment right now is that we best serve patients and shareholders by managing this business well.”  The company said it expects revenue in 2011 to be at the upper end of its current forecast of $15.1 billion to $15.5 billion. It expects 2011 adjusted earnings to be at the upper end of its current forecast of $5.00 to $5.20 a share.

10,AMGN,FDA: Generic biotech drugs require paradigm shift," * FDA gives glimpse of biosimilar approval process   * No “one size fits all” approach, FDA says   * Must evaluate “totality of evidence” for biotech copies   * FDA to release final guidance on biosimilars this year   By Anna Yukhananov   WASHINGTON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Evaluating generic versions of complex biotechnology medicines will require a new, more rigorous review process, U.S. drug regulators said, in the first glimpse of their thinking on the subject.   Drugmakers, investors and others have been clamoring for more insight into the approval process for cheaper versions of biotech drugs, known as “biosimilars” — a potentially multibillion dollar market.   In an article in this week’s New England Journal of Medicine made public on Wednesday, officials from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the approval for biosimilars “will require a new paradigm of sponsor-FDA interactions,” involving analysis of much more data than traditional generics.   Unlike conventional chemical-based drug compounds, biotech drugs are derived from living organisms, such as proteins, and often produced using recombinant DNA technologies.   Tiny differences in manufacturing mean biological drugs are impossible to replicate exactly, leaving regulators with the task of deciding just “how similar is similar enough,” when looking at copycat versions of already-approved medicines.   “Given the complex nature of biologics, it’s unlikely that a ‘one size fits all’ systematic assessment of biosimilarity can be developed,” FDA officials, including the head of its drugs center, Janet Woodcock, said in the article.   Approval guidelines are likely to be product-specific and all-encompassing, examining the “totality of evidence” available about a particular class of biotech drugs.   Speaking directly to the medical community, the FDA said it may have to review everything from the specific populations targeted by drugs and the process by which they are made.   Only then will the FDA suggest what clinical trials companies should conduct to verify any remaining doubts about safety or efficacy.   “The FDA is currently considering how such interactions (with companies) might be structured and how they will affect the user-fee program that Congress has mandated for biosimilars,” the FDA said, referring to industry fees that drugmakers pay to help cover the costs of drug reviews.   Many drugmakers await the market for biosimilars, including traditional generic manufacturers such as Israel’s Teva Pharmaceuticals TEVA.O, makers of branded biotech drugs like Amgen (AMGN.O) and Roche ROG.VX, and other big pharma companies, including Pfizer (PFE.N) and Novartis NOVN.VX.   The market will range from relatively simple molecules like insulin to far more complex anti-cancer antibody medicines, growing to $3.7 billion by 2015 from just $243 million in 2010, according to a report from market analysis firm Datamonitor.   In 2009, Congress asked the FDA to develop a faster pathway for approving biosimilars to reduce the cost of biotech drugs. The agency plans to issue guidance this year. [ID:nN09164934]   Regulatory oversight of generic versions of traditional pills and capsules has been in place for decades. They are relatively easy to replicate and prove equivalence to branded medicines.   Agreement on a pathway for producing cheaper versions of biotech drugs — which treat diseases like cancer, arthritis and multiple sclerosis — has been far more difficult because of their complex manufacturing process.   Making biotech copies is also more costly, as manufacturers must conduct extra clinical trials to show the new version is as good as the old one.   However, new technologies that can more accurately describe the unique “fingerprint” of a biotech medicine can help more easily compare it to a copycat version, FDA officials said.   While this “fingerprint” technology is in its early stages, extra animal and clinical trials will still be required “for the foreseeable future,” the officials wrote.   Some biosimilars are already available in Europe, including versions of Amgen Inc’s anemia drug Epogen, and companies are launching partnerships. [ID:nL6E7HL0HB]   The European Medicines Agency (EMA) published guidelines for biosimilars in 2005, and approved the first such drug in 2006. FDA officials said they are studying European regulations, and will likely follow the EMA’s approach of product-specific requirements for different biosimilars.   Despite the FDA’s efforts to develop guidelines, other U.S. regulations may discourage some biosimilar makers by giving more protection to branded biotech therapies.   Under the U.S. healthcare law passed last year, brand-name biologic drugs — which can carry annual price tags in the tens of thousands of dollars — were granted a 12-year period of market exclusivity before generic versions can be sold.   Some potential biosimilar producers may prefer to alter an existing molecule to improve efficacy or safety, turning it into a new drug in the eyes of the FDA and securing an additional 12-year exclusivity.

11,AMGN,"Analysis: New drugs add mileage to Bristol, Vertex and Amgen","NEW YORK (Reuters) - New drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Vertex Pharmaceuticals are selling fast out of the gate, and their recent share sell-offs provide investors with a new opportunity to profit from the medicines’ bright futures.  Bristol’s melanoma drug Yervoy and Vertex’s hepatitis C treatment Incivek, as well as Amgen’s Xgeva for preventing bone fractures in cancer patients stormed past early sales projections because they are simply too good to be ignored, industry experts said.  “Vertex doubled the cure rate and Yervoy is the only drug approved ever that improved survival in melanoma,” said Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst for ISI Group. “It becomes immediately medically unacceptable to not use them in patients whom you are treating, and there’s no debate around it.”  “Xgeva is not quite as dramatic, but they did do a head-to-head trial with the current standard of care and they beat it,” Schoenebaum added.  All three medicines are expected to generate eventual annual sales in excess of $1 billion, with some analyst estimates for Incivek running north of $3 billion.  All arrived to doctors and patients clamoring for new treatments, proving the value of innovative medicines as many drugmakers stand to lose billions of dollars of revenue as older products come off patent.  “They are all first in class drugs for diseases that have not been well treated prior. If companies can deliver drugs that deliver the goods they are going to be successful,” said Les Funtleyder, portfolio manager for Miller Tabak & Co.  Bristol shares are off about 9 percent since a year-high on July 21, Amgen shares are down more than 17 percent since touching a year-high in mid-May and Vertex has fallen 25 percent since reaching a high in May just prior to Incivek’s approval — all dragged down along with broader market plunges.  Analysts believe there is money to be made betting on any of these companies, especially with shares in their current beaten down state.  Schoenebaum said Amgen was a bargain at its current price, and that the ease of tracking Incivek prescription growth makes Vertex attractive. His Amgen price target of $68 is well above the current share price of around $48, while his Vertex price target of $54 leaves room to grow from its current price of about $43.  “Bristol is clearly right now the best company within the U.S. large pharma arena,” he added.  The most bullish Wall Street price targets see Amgen rising as much as 63 percent, Vertex nearly doubling and Bristol-Myers with room to grow by 47 percent, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters.  All three recently approved medicines soared past most initial Wall Street sales estimates in the second quarter, defying the typical slow launch for most new medicines.  “There are demographic trends that would suggest that these drugs are going to see more demand,” said Funtleyder, who agreed that it was not too late to jump on the bandwagon.  In just its first five weeks on the market, Incivek sales reached $74.5 million.  “What this means is there are a lot of patients out there waiting for treatment with new hepatitis C drugs,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges.  “This is a genuine breakthrough. It’s dramatically altering the outlook for these patients and they’re lining up at physicians’ offices,” Porges said.  Much the same can be said for Yervoy, which in March became the first FDA approved treatment to offer real hope to patients with the deadliest form of skin cancer.  Yervoy, which spurs the immune system to fight the cancer, posted sales of $95 million in its first quarter on the market, helping Bristol to a better-than-expected second quarter profit.  Xgeva, which offers potential for a better quality of life to advanced cancer patients in danger of serious bone problems, nearly doubled expectations in its first full quarter on the market and recorded $75 million in second quarter sales, sailing past analysts’ average estimates of $66 million.  They stand in stark contrast to Dendreon Corp’s year-old prostate cancer vaccine Provenge, which was approved with great fanfare but has yet to catch on with physicians. The company last week pulled its bullish 2011 sales forecast, saying doctors were balking at dealing with reimbursement for its high price tag.  While Amgen and Bristol are looking to their new drugs to help replace fading sales of older products or those about to face generic competition, Incivek is the first commercial product for far smaller Vertex. But the biotech company was well prepared for its foray into uncharted territory.  Two years prior to Incivek approval, Chief Executive Joshua Boger — long the soul of Vertex and the visionary behind the medicine — stepped aside to make way for Matthew Emmens, a sales savvy CEO with several drug launches under his belt.  “They are lucky to have him. He’s got a very good track record,” Funtleyder said of Emmens. “Drug development and drug sales are two different skill sets and not everyone has both.”  That move, as well as the drug’s superior efficacy, appears to be paying off. Early Incivek prescriptions are outpacing those for a similar new rival drug from Merck & Co by a rate of better than three-to-one.  Investors may also do well to get behind companies with a new class of drug for preventing blood clots and strokes in heart patients.  The first of the new blood thinners, Pradaxa, comes from privately held Boehringer Ingelheim. But demand for that drug — more than 250,000 patients prescribed in its first seven months — bodes well for others, including apixaban from Bristol and Pfizer that may prove to be superior.

12,AMGN,Factbox: U.S. health and defense industries' lobbying clout,"(Reuters) - The health and defense industries are readying for battle as a bipartisan committee determines how to trim $1.5 trillion from the federal budget over the next 10 years.  Senate and House members already appointed to the committee have ties to both industries, which have a long history of influence on Capitol Hill.  The defense industry spent more than $210 million to lobby Congress over roughly the past 18 months.  According to a database maintained by the Center for Responsive Politics, a total of 843 lobbyists represented 279 defense industry clients in 2011 so far.  Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon are some of the top spenders on Capitol Hill.  Despite the U.S. Department of Defense consuming a large chunk of the federal budget, the defense industry’s contributions to members of Congress are low compared to other industries like pharmaceuticals.  Historically, Republicans benefit most from the defense industry. And looking toward the 2012 elections, the industry contributed 62 percent of its funds to Republicans so far.  The health industry is one of the biggest spenders on Capitol Hill, and employs an army of lobbyists. In fact, lobbyists representing drug manufacturers, health care providers and insurance companies outnumber members of Congress 5-to-1, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.  Over roughly the past 18 months the health industry has spent more than $765 million on Capitol Hill. The pharmaceutical and health product sector contributed more than half of that amount.  Pfizer Inc, Amgen Inc, Abbott Laboratories and Merck & Co. are some of the top contributors along with associations, such as the American Dental Association and the American Hospital Association.  Republicans received more contributions from the health industry during the 2012 election cycle so far — about $6.5 million. Democrats are lagging by $2.1 million.  All data were obtained through the Center for Responsive Politics and are current through August 10. The Center for Responsive Politics data comes from the Senate Office of Public Records and the Federal Election Commission.

14,AMGN,Factbox: U.S. health and defense industries' lobbying clout,"(Reuters) - The health and defense industries are readying for battle as a bipartisan committee determines how to trim $1.5 trillion from the federal budget over the next 10 years.  Senate and House members already appointed to the committee have ties to both industries, which have a long history of influence on Capitol Hill.  The defense industry spent more than $210 million to lobby Congress over roughly the past 18 months.  According to a database maintained by the Center for Responsive Politics, a total of 843 lobbyists represented 279 defense industry clients in 2011 so far.  Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon are some of the top spenders on Capitol Hill.

15,AMGN,RPT-INSIGHT-Next big drug against cholesterol takes shape," The clearest advantage so far has been seen in Regeneron’s new drug. Data from initial studies suggests REGN727 may be able to reduce LDL by another 50 percent when used in combination with statins, which themselves can cut LDL in half.   “Regeneron’s anti-PCSK9 antibody really looks like a magic bullet against LDL cholesterol” said Ziad Bakri, a biotechnology analyst with T. Rowe Price. His firm is one of Regeneron’s largest shareholders, with a 9.5 percent stake as of the end of June.   Assuming longer-term studies demonstrate the drug is safe and prevents heart attacks and stroke, Bakri estimates it could capture annual sales “in the billions of dollars” if approved.   “Taking advantage of this pathway is a creative leap forward,” said Dr. Kristin Newby, a Duke University heart researcher who has no involvement in PCSK9 research.   But she cautioned that other classes of novel medicines have stumbled because of unexpected safety problems.   She cited torcetrapib, a drug to raise “good” HDL cholesterol that Pfizer had expected to reap annual sales of more than $10 billion. Meant to drive down the incidence of heart attacks, the drug instead was linked to deaths and was scrapped in 2006 after costly late-stage trials.   Data from a similar HDL-raising drug being developed by Roche Holding AG ROG.VX will be released on Sunday at the annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology in Paris. But cutting LDL cholesterol remains the most proven way of reducing heart attacks and stroke, and is the industry’s prime focus.   Should PCSK9 inhibitors stumble, it would be a keen disappointment for some of the world’s biggest drugmakers.   Amgen, the largest global biotech company, is wrapping up early-stage trials of its PCSK9 inhibitor and will soon advance it into Phase II studies.   “There’s a real opportunity to change the paradigm of treating cardiovascular disease with this therapy,” said Scott Wasserman, Amgen’s global project leader for cardiovascular medicines.      Andrew Plump, head of cardiovascular discovery for Merck, cautions that long-term trials must confirm the value of PCSK9 blockers. But he predicts that when used with statins, they could reduce heart attack and stroke risk 25 to 30 percent beyond the 25 to 30 percent reduced risk seen with statins alone.   “PCSK9 is one of the most interesting proteins in the human body,” Plump said. “We didn’t know anything about it a decade ago, and the speed at which drug programs have progressed is astounding.”   Merck has not disclosed details of its PCSK9 program, but Plump said the company is interested in developing injectable and pill formulations.   Former Merck chief executive Roy Vagelos, who introduced the world’s first statin Mevacor in 1987, is helping oversee development of Regeneron’s product as chairman of its board.   Two Nobel Prize winners whose research directly led to discovery of statins, Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein, are members of Regeneron’s board, as is Christine Poon, former head of Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) pharmaceuticals group.   “This is a big, enormous opportunity,” Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said in an interview. “It could become one of the biggest drugs in biotechnology.”   Regeneron also hopes to benefit from the expertise of partner Sanofi, whose Plavix blood clot preventer has annual sales of more than $9 billion. The companies aim to split any profits evenly from their PCSK9 medicine.   In a series of experiments conducted separately by four research teams, scientists showed that PCSK9 wipes out LDL receptors, proteins that bind to LDL cholesterol in the liver and remove the artery-clogging substance from the bloodstream.   The mechanism is one of many ways the body regulates LDL to make sure there is enough of it to perform vital body functions, although not more than is necessary. But when PCSK9 goes overboard in destroying LDL receptors, LDL rises to harmful levels.   While early studies focused on patients with genetic mutations that triggered sky-high production of LDL, Helen Hobbs and colleague Jonathan Cohen theorized in 2005 that other mutations in PCSK9 might exist and have the opposite effect: of inactivating the gene and thereby leading to lower LDL levels.   They examined the structure of the gene in African-Americans who had low LDL. Their research showed that 2 percent of them had an inherited mutated form of the gene, and that their LDL levels were about a third lower than individuals without the mutation. The two researchers from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center went on to show that the subjects were protected from heart disease.   The findings strongly suggested the possible benefits of blocking PCSK9 or its activity.   “We knew what we had right away: the potential for a new way to lower LDL levels in humans,” Hobbs said.   Two young women found to have no PCSK9 at all had LDL levels of just 14 to 16 — one-eighth normal levels. Yet they were deemed to be in good health, suggesting to Hobbs and others that blocking PCSK9 may not pose great safety risks.   “The reaction to Dr. Hobbs’ findings was electric among those who understood the field,” said Dr. Daniel Steinberg, professor emeritus at the University of California-San Diego. “The science was solid and suggested that blocking PCSK9 could be as important as statins in terms of controlling coronary artery disease.”   Steinberg, who has written extensively on PCSK9, said that patients with the protective mutation were shown to have an almost 90 percent reduced risk of coronary artery disease, compared with the general population.   “That’s probably because their LDL has been low from birth,” he said. Steinberg said anti-PCSK9 drugs could save tens of thousands of lives a year, as statins now do.   Statins actually raise levels of PCSK9, thereby undermining their own effectiveness in reducing LDL. “So if you give a statin, plus a PCSK9 inhibitor, you could get a bigger bang for your buck,” Steinberg said.   Patients taking PCSK9 inhibitors might also be able to take lower doses of statins, and thereby avoid their side effects, such as muscle weakness and liver toxicity.   Some studies suggest PCSK9 may help regenerate liver tissue, so drugs that block it theoretically could pose a risk to alcoholics or others with existing liver damage.   Studies will test the liver risk, and also show whether the new medicines affect HDL cholesterol or cause side effects in other organs where PCSK9 is concentrated.   While safety must be established, Alnylam research executive Akshay Vaishnaw is betting on PCSK9 drugs.   “There’s no question that this is going to be the greatest intervention, following statins, for treatment of high cholesterol. It’s absolutely going to be the next big thing.”  (Reporting by Ransdell Pierson, Editing by Michele Gershberg and Matthew Lewis)   ",8262011,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-cholesterol/rpt-insight-next-big-drug-against-cholesterol-takes-shape-idUSN1E77L1IP20110826

17,AMGN,Cancer-fighting virus shown to target tumors alone,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Researchers have shown for the first time that a single intravenous infusion of a genetically engineered virus can home in on cancer, killing tumor cells in patients without harming healthy tissue.  Scientists have been intrigued for decades with the idea of using viruses to alert the immune system to seek and destroy cancerous cells. That interest has taken off in recent years as advances in genetic engineering allow them to customize viruses that target tumors.  The field received a boost in January when biotech giant Amgen Inc agreed to pay up to $1 billion for BioVex, the developer of experimental cancer-fighting virus OncoVex. But the only “oncolytic virus” so far approved by a regulatory agency is for treatment of head and neck cancer in China.  In a study published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, scientists at institutions including the University of Ottawa and privately held biotech company Jennerex Inc said a small, early-stage trial of experimental viral therapy JX-954 found that it consistently infected tumors with only minimal and temporary side effects.  The experimental virus will next be tested in a mid-stage trial of patients with liver cancer.  “With chemotherapy you get drastic side effects,” said Dr. John Bell, chief scientific officer at Jennerex and senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute. “Patients on this treatment only had 24-hour flu symptoms, and nothing after that.”  The trial, which involved 23 patients with various types of advanced cancer, was designed to assess the safety of JX-954. It also found that six of the eight patients given the two highest doses saw their tumors stabilize or shrink.  Seven patients in that group, or 87 percent, had evidence of viral replication in their tumors, but not in normal tissues.  Dr. Bell said the next step is a Phase 2b trial of the viral therapy in 120 patients with primary liver cancer, known as hepatocellular carcinoma.  He said earlier trials of JX-954 showed really strong activity in liver cancer. Since some kinds of liver cancer are caused by viruses — like hepatitis B — the theory is that those tumor cells may be more susceptible to a second virus.  JX-954 is derived from a strain of the virus once commonly used to vaccinate children against smallpox.  “We know it is pretty safe,” Dr. Bell said, noting that genetic information needed for the virus to mutate has been deleted from JX-954.  He also said that because the Jennerex virus can be given intravenously, spreading throughout the body, it may hold promise for limiting the ability of cancer cells to metastasize and spread.  Other viral cancer therapies are also progressing in clinical trials, but they either require direct injection into the tumor or accompany chemotherapy. Results from a Phase 3 melanoma trial of Amgen’s OncoVex, which is directly injected into tumors, are expected next year.  Oncolytics Biotech Inc is conducting a pivotal trial of its experimental virus, Reolysin, in combination with chemotherapy for patients with head and neck cancer.  “We are all competing against standard of care,” said Matt Coffey, chief operating officer at Oncolytics Biotech.  Jennerex is primarily funded by investors from Canada and South Korea. European rights to JX-954 have been licensed to Transgene.

Summaries of several other late-stage trials to be presented at a major rheumatology meeting in November were released on Thursday and confirmed earlier findings that the Pfizer drug, tofacitinib, was effective and in general well tolerated.   The incidence of overall adverse events was similar for both drugs, but the proportion of patients who developed serious side effects, though small, was numerically higher in the tofacitinib groups.   Serious adverse effects are those deemed to have caused death, life-threatening events, need for hospitalization, or disability or permanent damage.   “Impressive efficacy was demonstrated, with focus now expected to be on safety leading into its regulatory review,” Jeffrey Holford, an analyst at Jefferies & Co, said in a research note. “While the market was expecting a similar efficacy between the higher dose of tofacitinib and Humira, the strong performance of the lower dose is impressive.”   Pfizer plans to seek approval of the medicine by the end of the year. The world’s biggest drugmaker is hoping tofacitinib, which some analysts believe can reach $2 billion in annual sales, and other new medicines can help offset plunging revenue from its Lipitor cholesterol fighter when it faces competition from cheaper generics as early as November.   Pfizer shares fell 1 percent to $18.82 early Thursday afternoon.   Data from a 12-month trial comparing tofacitinib and Humira, called ORAL Standard, involved 717 patients with moderate to severe disease who continued to take a widely used treatment called methotrexate.   One group of the patients took 5 milligram doses of the Pfizer drug twice a day, a second group took 10 mg doses twice a day, while a third group received Humira injections every two weeks. A fourth group of patients received a placebo.   The effectiveness of tofacitinib and Humira was numerically similar by all measures, according to the data, although the study was not designed to definitively assess superiority of one drug over the other.   Full details of the tofacitinib Phase III studies are expected to be unveiled in November at the annual American College of Rheumatology (ACR) scientific meeting in Chicago.   “Based on the totality of the tofacitinib RA clinical development program, Pfizer believes the risk/benefit profile supports regulatory submission for both the 5 and 10 mg dose,” Pfizer spokeswoman Victoria Davis said.   Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen predicted both doses of tofacitinib will be approved next year. But he said the drug should not greatly hamper sales of Humira its first few years on the market because doctors will prescribe tofacitinib mainly for patients who have failed to benefit from standard treatments.   “However, we expect tofacitinib to have a larger impact on Humira over time as Pfizer tries to move its use to an earlier stage” of treatment, Biegelsen said in a research note.   He said Humira is on track for sales this year of $7.8 billion, and that they will grow to $10.5 billion in 2015.   Data also became available for the first time on Thursday on the incidence of overall mortality and infections across numerous late-stage trials of the Pfizer medicine, and from longer-term follow-up of patients.   That pooled analysis, involving more than 6,200 patients, showed a mortality rate with tofacitinib of 0.572 deaths per 100 patient years in the Phase III trials, and 0.641 deaths per 100 patient years in the long-term evaluations.   In all, 12 patients died out of more than 3,000 who received tofacitinib in the Phase III trials, with deaths of another 20 patients seen among more than 3,200 who were followed in longer-term studies.   Pfizer said the death rates were consistent with those typically seen with standard treatments meant to slow the progress of arthritis symptoms.   Tofacitinib belongs to a new class of drugs known as JAK inhibitors that block a protein associated with inflammation.   It would compete against a lucrative family of biotech treatments that block a different protein called tumor necrosis factor. These treatments include Humira, one of the world’s biggest selling medicines, as well as Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) Remicade and Enbrel, which is sold by Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) and Pfizer.

23,AMGN,UPDATE 2-US FDA advisers wary of time limit on bone drugs," * Bisphosphonates widely used to prevent osteoporosis   * Links to femur fractures, jaw bone death, perhaps cancer   * FDA advisers vote 17-6 to alter labels   * Citing uncertain data, did not agree on a time limit   ADELPHI, Md., Sept 9 (Reuters) - U.S. health advisers declined to suggest how long women should take a class of drugs used by millions to prevent bone fractures, but agreed the labels should be changed to reflect uncertainty about the risks and benefits of long-term use.   The Food and Drug Administration had asked two of its advisory panels to recommend whether a “drug holiday” or some time limit was warranted on a class of osteoporosis drugs known as bisphosphonates that have been linked to unusual thigh fractures and other side effects.   Instead, the advisers voted 17-6 on Friday to make changes to the labeling with many in favor of specifying how often patients need a re-evaluation of whether they need the medicine.   Panelists repeatedly raised concerns that they did not have enough evidence to come up with specific suggestions or conclusions, and some recommended raising awareness of such uncertainties in the label as well.   “I don’t think we have enough data to restrict anything at this point,” said Dr. Maria Suarez-Almazor, professor at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and a panel member.   The drugs under review include Merck & Co’s (MRK.N) Fosamax, Warner Chilcott’s WCRX.O Actonel, Roche’s ROG.VX Boniva and Novartis’ NOVN.VX (NVS.N) Reclast. This class of drugs has also been linked to osteonecrosis of the jaw, or jaw bone death, and a possible higher cancer risk.   Studies presented by the FDA and the industry did not paint a conclusive picture to estimate whether benefits outweigh the risks in taking bisphosphonates for longer than three to five years or how exactly each of these drugs affects various subgroups of patients, advisers said.   “I’m used to dealing with ambiguity in a clinical setting, but this raises it to different heights,” said Brian Erstad, pharmacy professor at the University of Arizona and a member of the drug safety and risk management advisory panel.   Some 4.5 million Americans over the age of 55 filled prescriptions for bisphosphonates in 2009, predominantly women after menopause to prevent osteoporosis, a progressive bone-thinning condition that typically causes bone fractures in the hip, wrist or spine.   FDA staff said the use of the drugs is associated with unusual femur fractures, and the risk of jaw bone death may increase the longer people take them orally. But they said the evidence for an increased cancer risk was inconsistent.   Boniva is available as either an injection or a tablet, Reclast is an injection, and the other drugs are taken orally.   FDA researchers found no advantage in staying on the drugs beyond five years and no loss of efficacy from discontinuing their use. Drugmakers, however, warned that a sweeping imposition of an interruption in treatment by the FDA may leave patients vulnerable to more fractures.   “Despite rare side effects, those patients who take bisphosphonates have fewer fractures and lower mortality, and these findings need to be shared with our patients,” said Dr. Robert Adler, an invited speaker and endocrinology professor at the Virginia Commonwealth University.   With millions taking the medication, the sales of Merck’s Fosamax reached $3 billion in 2007 but revenue plunged to $926 million by 2010 with the pill facing competition from cheaper generics beginning in early 2008.   Analysts have said mounting concerns about bisphosphonates may drive patients to Amgen Inc’s (AMGN.O) new medicine, Prolia, a different type of osteoporosis drug.   Orrel Lanter took Merck’s Fosamax and its generic version, known chemically as alendronate, for nine years.   “I felt something go ‘snap’ in my leg. My right foot flopped out to the right and my leg became a noodle, the pain was excruciating,” she told the advisers on Friday. At the emergency room, she was told she had an atypical femur fracture that she attributes to years of taking bisphosphonates.   “I was a happy healthy, very active outdoors woman now left crippled because of this awful drug,” said Lanter, who is now 68 and walked out of the room using a cane.   Since Merck’s Fosamax became the first bisphosphonate to get approval for osteoporosis in 1995, the labels for the drugs in this class have undergone multiple reviews and changes.   In 2005, a warning of higher risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw was added to labels, and in 2009, a caution about adverse gastrointestinal reactions. Earlier this year, the labels were changed to add a warning of atypical femur fractures and Reclast’s label now mentions a higher risk of kidney failure.   Still, drugmakers and some of the panelists agreed that some groups of patients, perhaps those at highest risk of bone fractures, could benefit from longer-term use of such drugs.   Whether and how to address these issues is now up to the FDA.

26,AMGN,UPDATE 1-Amgen osteoporosis drug effective in study," Sept 18 (Reuters) - An Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) drug to treat osteoporosis in women increased bone mineral density (BMD), an important determinant of bone strength, the biotechnology company said.   Results of the Phase 2 study extension showed that for post-menopausal women with low bone mass, or osteoporosis, who received up to eight years of continued treatment with Prolia (denosumab), bone mineral density increased on average 16.8 percent at the lumbar spine and 6.9 percent in the total hip, Amgen said.   Prolia is the first approved therapy that specifically targets an essential regulator of osteoclasts, the cells that break down the cells that break down bone.   Osteoporosis is a global problem that is increasing in significance as the population of the world ages. The World Health Organization has declared osteoporosis a public health crisis.

27,AMGN,FDA clears Amgen bone drug for cancer patients,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. drug regulators approved two new uses for Amgen Inc’s osteoporosis drug Prolia, allowing it to be used for bone loss associated with certain cancer treatments.  The Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved Prolia for the treatment of bone loss in women with breast cancer and in certain men with non-metastatic prostate cancer, making it the first drug for cancer treatment-induced bone loss.  Prolia was approved in 2010 to treat osteoporosis in post-menopausal women who have an increased risk of fractures.  The new indication allows it to be used in women receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer and in men with prostate cancer who are being treated with hormone therapy.  Both types of treatment reduce hormone levels, leading to bone loss and an increased risk of fracture.  Shares of Amgen were down 0.5 percent in morning trade on Nasdaq, outperforming the Arca Pharmaceutical Index, which was down 1.7 percent.  Sales of Prolia were $44 million in the second quarter this year, up from $27 million in the first quarter.  Prolia has the same active ingredient, denosumab, as the Amgen drug Xvega, which is designed to prevent fractures in patients with cancer that has spread to the bone.  Denosumab is the first in a new class of medicines that work by blocking a protein that activates bone-destroying cells called osteoclasts.

29,AMGN,UPDATE 2-Amgen signals R&D; changes to employees,"* Employees are told changes are under evaluation * Aims to improve focus, reallocate resources Oct 12 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc , the world’s largest biotechnology company, has told its research and development staff it is evaluating changes in its R&D; programs, a company spokeswoman said on Wednesday. The company told employees the changes would be aimed at improving focus and reallocating resources to key pipeline assets and activities, Amgen’s Mary Klem said in a statement. She said additional details of the plans will be given on Oct. 24 when Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, California, announces its third-quarter financial results. Last year, Amgen posted revenue of $15.1 billion and spent $2.9 billion, or about 19 percent of its revenue, on R&D; — a level that some investors have deemed too high. “The $3 billion R&D; line item annually is high and investors see room to start to trim this,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee. He estimated that for every $100 million — or 3 percent — of R&D; cuts, Amgen’s earnings per share could increase by between 8 cents and 10 cents. Yee has forecast Amgen’s 2011 EPS at $5.20. Worldwide, the company’s staff totals about 17,000. Shares of Amgen have lost about a third of their value since early 2006, when safety concerns began to emerge about its flagship anemia drugs Epogen and Aranesp. The company’s shares closed at $56.64 on Wednesday and were unchanged after-hours.",10122011,http://www.reuters.com/article/amgen/update-2-amgen-signals-rd-changes-to-employees-idUSN1E79B1YR20111012

But sales of Amgen’s older red blood cell booster, Epogen, which have been hit by new dose utilization and reimbursement restrictions, came in short of Wall Street estimates and the company’s shares fell slightly after hours. The world’s largest biotechnology company now expects 2011 adjusted earnings of $5.15 to $5.30 per share and revenue of $15.4 billion to $15.6 billion. Its previous forecast called for earnings at the upper end of a $5.00 to $5.20 range and revenue toward the upper end of $15.1 billion to $15.5 billion. Excluding items such as a $780 million charge to settle a probe into sales and marketing practices, Amgen had adjusted earnings of $1.40 per share, exceeding analysts’ average expectations by 11 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Amgen said if settlement discussions are successful the $780 million would resolve Federal probes and related state Medicaid claims, as well as other litigation. It expects a resolution in the next three or four months. “Amgen handily beat third quarter EPS estimates, but much of the beat was driven by lower share count and a much lower than expected tax rate,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a research note. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 10.9 percent compared with 19.1 percent a year ago. The rate was lowered by foreign tax credits. Amgen posted a net profit of $454 billion, or 50 cents per share, compared with a profit of $1.24 billion, or $1.28 per share, a year ago. The charge reduced net earnings by 77 cents per share. The company, which last week said it was cutting 380 jobs in research and development, also said the board authorized an increase in its share buyback program to $10 billion. The company recently initiated a dividend as it seeks to increase returns to shareholders. Research chief Roger Perlmutter told analysts on a conference call that most of the job cuts came from researchers working on early stage programs. He said the company wanted to focus on programs most likely to have near term financial impact while reining in costs. Despite the cuts, Chief Executive Kevin Sharer said: “We remain very committed to heavy investment in R&D.;” Perlmutter singled out Amgen’s experimental cancer drug rilotumumab, or AMG-102, which he said appeared to improve survival in patients with gastric cancer. “We will be reviewing those findings carefully,” he said. Amgen said revenue for the quarter rose 3 percent to $3.94 billion, topping Wall Street estimates of $3.87 billion. But sales of several of its medicines were shy of analysts’ expectations. Sales of Enbrel for rheumatoid arthritis and the skin condition psoriasis rose 1 percent to $925 million due to a price increase. But analysts had been looking for sales of about $933 million. Xgeva, Amgen’s new drug to prevent fractures in cancer that has spread to the bones, saw sales increase to $100 million from $73 million in the prior quarter. But that was short of expectations of about $101 million to $108 million for the drug considered to be Amgen’s most important future growth driver. The company expects to hear in April whether U.S. regulators will approve Xgeva for preventing the spread of cancer to the bone, which could significantly boost sales. The related osteoporosis drug Prolia, which has had a relatively slow launch, had sales of $51 million for the quarter, up from $44 million in the second quarter, but below Wall Street estimates for about $57 million. The white blood cell boosters Neupogen and Neulasta provided a bright spot for the quarter. Combined worldwide sales were up 6 percent to $1.34 billion, surpassing Wall Street estimates of about $1.28 billion. “Xgeva was solid and Neupogen/Neulasta was a little bit better than expected,” said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt. “Those accounted for about $50 million of upside versus expectations,” said Schmidt, adding that share buybacks also contributed to the better-than-expected earnings. Sales of Epogen fell 27 percent to $476 million, well below Wall Street’s diminished expectations of about $509 million. Its once top selling Aranesp red blood cell booster saw sales decline 4 percent to $600 million. Amgen shares declined 20 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $58.75 in extended trading.",10242011,http://www.reuters.com/article/amgen/update-3-amgen-posts-mixed-q3-raises-full-year-outlook-idUSN1E79N1PU20111024
31,AMGN,Medicare confirms changes in anemia drug use,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Medicare federal health insurance program has confirmed plans to remove a requirement that kidney dialysis providers keep patient hemoglobin levels above a set minimum — a move likely to reduce use of Epogen, the anemia drug sold by Amgen Inc. In a statement on its web site on Tuesday, the agency issued a final rule to remove, starting in payment year 2013, a requirement that patients’ hemoglobin, or red blood cell, levels be kept above 10 milligrams per deciliter. It said the action was consistent with labeling approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration). Medicare said dialysis providers should continue to target 12 g/dL has the top end for patient hemoglobin levels. Analysts have surmised that the removal of a minimum hemoglobin target will result in minimal dosing of Epogen. Officials at Amgen did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FDA earlier this year changed the labels for Amgen’s Epogen and Johnson & Johnson’s Procrit to call for lower dosing of the anemia drugs, which have been linked in recent years to safety concerns such as increased risk of heart problems. Sales of the drugs have declined steeply in the past several years, but Epogen, along with Amgen’s second-generation drug Aranesp, and J&J;’s Procrit are still expected to generate billions in 2011 sales. The proposed change would apply under Medicare’s quality performance standards for “bundled” payments to dialysis providers and would affect payment years 2013 and 2014, the agency said. While Medicare traditionally covers just elderly and disabled Americans, kidney disease patients are an exception. The program covers all those with end stage renal disease under a decades-old law.

33,AMGN,Amgen widens focus on PCSK9 cholesterol drugs,"* Amgen anti-PCSK9 drug slashes LDL in healthy volunteers * Patients followed for 85 to 113 days after one injection * Data come on heels of favorable Regeneron studies By Ransdell Pierson Nov 14 (Reuters) - A potentially powerful new approach to lower cholesterol by blocking a protein called PCSK9 gained ground, as a new drug from Amgen Inc cut levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol by almost two-thirds in a small study. The world’s largest biotechnology company on Monday presented data from the early stage trial that showed the highest dose of its treatment AMG145 cut LDL levels 64 percent in healthy volunteers, compared with a placebo injection. The study, whose results were presented at the annual scientific meeting of the American Heart Association in Orlando, involved 54 men and two women — 18 to 45 years old — who were healthy and not taking other medications. They received a single injection that contained one of five doses of AMG145, or a placebo, and their cholesterol was measured frequently for 85 to 113 days. “The more PCSK9 was lowered, the more bad cholesterol levels went down,” said Clapton Dias, a senior Amgen research executive who led the study. “With higher doses, bad cholesterol stayed lower for a longer period.” Amgen said it is now conducting a similar study among adults who are already taking standard treatments called statins to control their cholesterol. The California-based company is among a growing number of drugmakers that are racing to develop medicines that block PCSK9. U.S. biotechnology company Regeneron and its French pharmaceutical partner Sanofi are way out front, with plans to soon begin late-stage studies of their injectable product REGN727. The companies last week said their drug, when given at varying doses in combination with statins, further reduced LDL levels 30 percent to more than 65 percent. The patients have familial hypercholesterolemia, an inherited condition associated with very high LDL levels. Other companies testing anti-PCSK9 medicines include Pfizer , Merck & Co , Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  and a partnership between Bristol-Myers Squibb and Isis Pharmaceuticals .

34,AMGN,Amgen widens focus on PCSK9 cholesterol drugs,"(Reuters) - A potentially powerful new approach to lower cholesterol by blocking a protein called PCSK9 gained ground, as a new drug from Amgen cut levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol by almost two-thirds in a small study. The world’s largest biotechnology company on Monday presented data from the early stage trial that showed the highest dose of its treatment AMG145 cut LDL levels 64 percent in healthy volunteers, compared with a placebo injection. The study, whose results were presented at the annual scientific meeting of the American Heart Association in Orlando, involved 54 men and two women — 18 to 45 years old — who were healthy and not taking other medications. They received a single injection that contained one of five doses of AMG145, or a placebo, and their cholesterol was measured frequently for 85 to 113 days. “The more PCSK9 was lowered, the more bad cholesterol levels went down,” said Clapton Dias, a senior Amgen research executive who led the study. “With higher doses, bad cholesterol stayed lower for a longer period.” Amgen said it is now conducting a similar study among adults who are already taking standard treatments called statins to control their cholesterol. The California-based company is among a growing number of drugmakers that are racing to develop medicines that block PCSK9. U.S. biotechnology company Regeneron and its French pharmaceutical partner Sanofi are way out front, with plans to soon begin late-stage studies of their injectable product REGN727. The companies last week said their drug, when given at varying doses in combination with statins, further reduced LDL levels 30 percent to more than 65 percent. The patients have familial hypercholesterolemia, an inherited condition associated with very high LDL levels. Other companies testing anti-PCSK9 medicines include Pfizer, Merck & Co, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and a partnership between Bristol-Myers Squibb and Isis Pharmaceuticals. The products, if approved, are expected to be used alongside statins, such as Pfizer’s Lipitor and AstraZeneca’s Crestor, for patients who do not achieve cholesterol-lowering goals with statins alone. They would also be used on their own for a much smaller group who cannot tolerate statins — oral drugs with global annual sales of $20 billion that inhibit the liver’s production of LDL cholesterol.

35,AMGN,"Amgen signs DaVita, Fresenius anemia drug deals","(Reuters) - Amgen Inc, aiming to secure future sales of its flagship anemia drug Epogen as potential competition emerges, has reached new supply contracts with the two largest operators of U.S. kidney dialysis clinics. The biotechnology company said in a regulatory filing on Friday it signed a seven-year contract to provide DaVita Inc with at least 90 percent of the clinic operator’s anemia drug needs. Amgen also entered into a “multi-year” agreement, starting in January, to supply Epogen on a “nonexclusive” basis to Fresenius Medical Care, according to Amgen spokeswomen Christine Regan. Fresenius has a U.S. dialysis market share of around 33 percent, while DaVita’s share is about 26 percent. Both contracts include discounts and rebates. “Amgen has effectively locked in two-thirds of its Epogen customer base with these DaVita and Fresenius contracts,” Stifel Nicolaus analyst Maged Shenouda said in a research note, adding that the deals are likely structured to give bigger discounts based on volume and competitor pricing. Epogen sales, which totaled $2.52 billion in 2010, have waned in recent years due to safety concerns. But Amgen still holds a virtual monopoly on the market for drugs used to boost red blood cell levels in kidney dialysis patients. That could change as generic, or “biosimilar,” versions of such erythropoiesis-stimulating agents reach the market and competitors such as Roche Holding AG start selling similar drugs. Another potential rival is Affymax Inc, which is seeking U.S. regulatory approval for its experimental drug, peginesatide, as a treatment of anemia in kidney dialysis patients. A panel of expert advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is set to review the drug, developed by Affymax and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, on December 7, with a final decision from the agency expected by March 27. Should it win approval, Affymax is expected to price its product below Epogen. The Medicare federal health insurance program began this year to reimburse dialysis clinics based on a fixed amount for each patient, rather than the previous method of simply marking up from costs — which critics argued led to overuse of drugs, including Epogen. Medicare, which traditionally covers elderly and disabled Americans, provides coverage for all those with end stage renal disease under a decades-old law. “Amgen might have agreed to match or partially match competitors’ epo pricing on the logic that taking (DaVita) out of the pricing picture would help preserve a far higher price,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in research note.

39,AMGN,FDA: Affymax anemia drug stacks up vs Amgen,"(Reuters) - Drug reviewers found Affymax Inc’s treatment for anemia in dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease to be as effective as market-leading drugs by Amgen Inc, but cautioned they were not convinced of its safety. In review documents released on Monday, U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff said uncertainty over the safety of Affymax’s treatment, known as peginesatide, remained a “major concern” from its clinical trials. But the reviewers also found the Affymax drug similarly effective as Amgen’s Epogen and Aranesp when it came to maintaining target hemoglobin levels. In dialysis patients, the drug had a similar safety profile to Epogen.

Late-stage trials of the Affymax drug, released in June, met their main goal but showed a higher rate of cardiovascular events, including death and stroke, in patients who were suffering from chronic renal failure but were not on dialysis. Although Affymax is not seeking approval for use in non-dialysis patients, the discrepancy in results had raised red flags, especially given that people on dialysis are generally sicker.

42,AMGN,"Amgen names new CEO, raises quarterly dividend","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), the world’s largest biotechnology company, said Chief Executive Officer Kevin Sharer will retire next May, and be replaced by Chief Operating Officer Bob Bradway. Sharer, 63, will retire as chairman at the end of 2012. He has been Amgen’s CEO since 2000, over a period in which the company’s stock price has been largely flat. “He did not create a lot of shareholder value in his tenure. Whether that was his fault or not is a question,” said Cowen & Co analyst Eric Schmidt. Shares of the Thousand Oaks, California-based company have suffered after safety concerns were raised several years ago about the safety of its flagship anemia drugs, Epogen and Aranesp. Schmidt said it was a bit surprising that Sharer did not stay in his post through the usual retirement age of 65. Given the lack of appreciation in Amgen’s shares, the CEO’s compensation package has also drawn fire from some investors. ISS Proxy Advisory Services said in a report earlier this year that “above-median bench-marking and a 53 percent increase in CEO pay in 2010 have resulted in a significant misalignment between pay and performance.” Sharer told Reuters in April that a management transition at Amgen was likely “in the next few years.” The drugmaker also announced on Thursday a hike in its quarterly dividend of nearly 30 percent. The company, which began paying a dividend just last year, announced a first-quarter payment of 36 cents a share to shareholders of record as of February 15, 2012. The previous quarterly dividend payment was 28 cents a share. Amgen, which recently bought back nearly 10 percent of its outstanding shares, has said it is committed to returning at least 60 percent of its earnings to investors. The company has also said it intends to meaningfully increase the dividend over time. Bradway will become CEO on May 23, 2012, and will also become chairman of the board at the end of next year, when Sharer retires from that position, the company said in a statement on Thursday. Amgen said Roger Perlmutter, 59, will retire as executive vice president of research and development next February, remaining as a consultant through February 2013. Chief Medical Officer Sean Harper was named to replace Perlmutter. Shares of Amgen, which rose 1.7 percent to close at $58.62 in regular trading, were little changed at $58.80 after hours.

43,AMGN,"Amgen, Watson to collaborate on cancer biosimilars","DEC 19 - Amgen Inc, the world’s largest biotechnology company, and generic drugmaker Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc, said on Monday they will work together to develop and sell biosimilar versions of several biotech cancer drugs. The companies, which plan to sell biosimilar products under a joint Amgen/Watson label, did not identify which drugs they are planning to develop cheaper versions of, but said they will not be current Amgen products. Scott Foraker, head of Amgen’s biosimilar division, said the company was fully committed to the effort and expects to see Amgen/Watson biosimilar products on the market in “the second half of this decade.” “Clearly, we’re all in,” Foraker told Reuters in a telephone interview. “We know exactly which products we’re going after. We have detailed product plans and it’s fair to say that there has been some work done on some of those products, so we’re not starting from scratch.” Amgen, which is already facing competition in Europe from biosimilars of some of its own products, signaled in April that it hoped to utilize its biotech manufacturing expertise to get into the business of biosimilars. Under terms of the agreement, Amgen will assume primary responsibility for developing, manufacturing and initially commercializing the biosimilar cancer drugs, the companies said. Watson will contribute up to $400 million in co-development costs and take advantage of its expertise in the sale and marketing of specialty and generic drugs. Watson will initially receive royalties and sales milestones from product revenue. Amgen’s biosimilar efforts, however, will not be limited to the collaboration with Watson. “Each company has the ability to pursue biosimilars outside of the products we’re collaborating on, and I will tell you that you can expect to see biosimilars from Amgen outside the oncology space in other therapeutic areas,” Foraker said, declining to identify which other areas. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected soon to shed more light on a process for the production and approval of less expensive copies of biotech medicines in the United States in an effort to save billions of dollars in health care costs. However, because biologic drugs are far more complex to produce than chemical pills, biosimilars are not expected to be anywhere near as cheap as traditional generic drugs. “Although the detailed guidance that the FDA is working on has not come out we have a pretty good idea of what their expectations are with respect to product development for biosimilars and they align well with our expectations,” Foraker said. Because medicines produced from living proteins cannot be exactly replicated the way chemical pills can, the products are commonly referred to as biosimilars rather than biogenerics and will require separate FDA guidelines for gaining approval than traditional generic drugs. “Biosimilars provide an exciting long-term growth opportunity for Amgen. We have a dedicated team to leverage existing capabilities and capacity and drive the success of the collaboration,” Amgen Chief Operating Officer Robert Bradaway, who will become CEO next year, said in a statement. The deal will also allow Watson to gain a major foothold in the field of biosimilars without having to first develop the complex capability of biologic manufacturing. Several other companies have expressed in interest in getting into the business of biosimilars, including Biogen Idec, Merck & Co, Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd and Sandoz, the generic unit of Swiss drugmaker Novartis.

46,AMGN,FDA staff unsure about new use for Amgen's Xgeva,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Reviewers from Food and Drug Administration said they were not sure whether Amgen Inc’s Xgeva bone drug should be also approved as a treatment to delay the spread of cancer to the bone. The FDA reviewers’ concerns, raised in documents released on Monday, appeared to dim any serious hopes that an advisory panel of outside experts would recommend approval of an expanded use of Xgeva, viewed by analysts as a drug whose sales could reach $1 billion a year. Amgen shares were down 0.7 percent on Monday afternoon. Xgeva, an injectable drug known chemically as denosumab, is approved to prevent fractures caused by cancer that has spread to the bone, but not to prevent or delay the spread. It is seen as one of the most important growth drivers for Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology company. “Based on the many concerns and questions raised by the FDA, we do not expect the advisory committee to endorse approval of denosumab for this indication,” Geoffrey Porges, an analyst for Sanford Bernstein, said in a research note. However, Porges said any downside of a negative vote would be limited. He said his long-term revenue estimates for Amgen would only decline by 2 percent in that case. The advisory panel will meet on Wednesday to decide whether to recommend approval of the drug for the wider use. The FDA will make a final decision later. Xgeva delayed the spread of cancer to the bone by a little longer than four months in a clinical trial of 1,432 men with prostate cancer who had stopped responding to hormone therapy. Amgen said the drug would be targeted at about 50,000 men in the United States at that stage of the disease. The FDA reviewers said it was unclear whether that length of time without cancer spreading was “an adequate measure of clinical benefit,” especially as the drug did not help men live longer or delay the growth of prostate cancer. The reviewers were also concerned that about one in 20 men treated with the drug developed osteonecrosis of the jaw, or death of jawbone tissue, and said it was uncertain whether the rate could be even higher if patients take the drug for a longer period. That rate is far higher than what has been seen with widely used osteoporosis drugs. The FDA will carefully weigh whether such a serious side effect undermines the benefits of Xgeva, even though the agency has a lower bar for toxicity where advanced cancer treatments are concerned. ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said the critical review of Xgeva was expected, since the FDA had previously questioned whether a delay in cancer spreading to the bone was a meaningful benefit to patients. “Even if the panel votes in favor of approval, commercial demand could be modest,” he added in a note, saying a favorable outcome would likely contribute about an additional $300 million a year to sales. In the fourth quarter, sales of Xgeva rose to $134 million, up from $100 million in the prior quarter. Amgen is hoping a broader use will significantly accelerate sales of the drug. Xgeva, along with related osteoporosis drug Prolia, are expected to offset declining sales of the anemia drugs that had been the company’s backbone. The company said it would tell the advisory committee that Xgeva provided a meaningful benefit to prostate cancer patients by preventing the spread of their disease to the bones, which is not uncommon. “Bone metastases ... are irreversible and progressive, and contribute major morbidity to these patients,” the company said in a statement. Amgen said that if Xgeva gains the wider approval, it would be the first drug to delay the spread of cancer to the bone for men with prostate cancer. Amgen said it was also testing Xgeva in other cancers, including breast and lung cancer and the blood cancer multiple myeloma.

Reviewers were also concerned that about one in 20 men treated with the drug developed osteonecrosis of the jaw, or death of jawbone tissue, and said it was uncertain whether the rate could be even higher if patients take the drug for a longer time. An advisory committee will vote Wednesday on whether to recommend approval of the drug for the wider use. The FDA will make a final decision later. Shares of the company were down 2.6 percent at $67.50 in morning Nasdaq trading. ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said the critical review of Xgeva was expected, since the FDA had previously questioned whether a delay in cancer spreading to the bone was a meaningful benefit to patients. “Even if the panel votes in favor of approval, commercial demand could be modest,” he added in a note, and said sales could reach about $300 million a year. In the fourth quarter, sales of Xgeva rose to $134 million from $100 million in the prior quarter. Amgen is hoping a broader use will significantly accelerate sales of the drug. Xgeva, along with related osteoporosis drug Prolia, are expected to offset declining sales of the anemia drugs that had been the company’s backbone. The company said it would tell the advisory committee that Xgeva provided a meaningful benefit to prostate cancer patients by preventing the spread of their disease to the bones, which often happens. “Bone metastases ... are irreversible and progressive, and contribute major morbidity to these patients,” the company said in a statement. Amgen said that if Xgeva is approved, it would be the first drug to delay the spread of cancer to the bone for men with prostate cancer. Amgen said it was also testing Xgeva in other cancers, including breast and lung cancer and multiple myeloma, or cancer of a type of white blood cell.

48,AMGN,FDA panel votes against wider use of Amgen drug,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An advisory panel on Wednesday recommended that U.S. health regulators reject the use of Amgen Inc’s drug Xgeva to delay the spread of prostate cancer to the bone, dimming the chance of a wider use for one of the company’s key growth drivers. The outside advisers to the Food and Drug Administration voted 12-to-1 that the benefits of the injectable drug, known chemically as denosumab, did not outweigh the risk of developing a jawbone-destroying condition. Xgeva is already approved to prevent fractures and related problems in advanced prostate cancer that has spread to the bone, and the company is seeking additional approval for use of the drug to delay or prevent the spread. The drug did delay the spread of cancer to the bone by a little longer than four months in a clinical trial of 1,432 men with prostate cancer who had stopped responding to hormone therapy. But about one in 15 men who took the drug developed osteonecrosis of the jaw, a severe side effect in which jawbone tissue dies, exposing the bone. That rate is far higher than has been seen with widely used osteoporosis drugs. “If you ask a patient, ‘Do you want to delay your disease by five minutes, but get significant toxicities?’ I think that would give them pause,” said panel member Maha Hussain, a professor of medicine in the hematology and oncology division at the University of Michigan. The FDA usually follows the recommendations of its expert panels and will make a final decision by April 26. Most analysts had expected the unfavorable panel vote because the FDA had questioned whether delaying the spread of cancer to the bone was a meaningful benefit to patients given that the drug did not help men live longer or delay the growth of prostate cancer.. “We believe the panel recommendation reinforces the FDA’s view, which has been consistently negative, and approval is unlikely,” said Geoff Meacham, analyst at JP Morgan, in a research note. However, he said the risk of a rejection of wider approval for Xgeva had only a modest risk to his long-term revenue estimates for Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology company. Xgeva and a related osteoporosis drug Prolia are seen as among the most important growth drivers for Amgen and are expected to help offset declining sales of the anemia drugs that had been the company’s backbone. In the fourth quarter of 2011, sales of Xgeva rose to $134 million from $100 million in the prior quarter, and it is expected to eventually become a $1 billion-a-year drug. The company said the new use for Xgeva would be targeted at about 50,000 men in the United States at that advanced stage of the disease. Panel members questioned whether using the drug earlier actually benefited patients, as many did not have symptoms of the disease, but would suffer any drug-related side effects. However, the patient representative on the panel voted in favor of approval. “There isn’t a treatment that a man with prostate cancer gets that doesn’t have devastating effects on his masculinity and his quality of life,” said James Kiefert, of Olympia, Washington. “In my opinion, the men who would be candidates for this treatment would be standing up and cheering another option for them.” His views echoed the favorable comments of several urologists, who testified in favor of the drug during the public hearing. Amgen said Xgeva provided a meaningful benefit to prostate cancer patients by preventing the spread of their disease to the bones, which is not uncommon. “We look forward to further discussions with the FDA as they continue to review our application,” the company said in a statement after the vote. If Xgeva gains wider approval, it would be the first drug to delay the spread of prostate cancer to the bone, Amgen said. Amgen said it was also testing Xgeva in other cancers, including breast and lung cancer and the blood cancer multiple myeloma.",2082012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fda-amgen-xgeva/fda-panel-votes-against-wider-use-of-amgen-drug-idUSTRE8172G820120208
49,AMGN,Monthly shots of Amgen drug slash cholesterol up to 66 percent,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Monthly injections of an experimental drug from Amgen Inc slashed levels of cholesterol by up to an additional 66 percent in patients already taking statins, researchers said on Sunday, making it a potential strong rival to a similar drug being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. Amgen and Regeneron are racing to develop medicines that cut cholesterol through a new strategy, by blocking a protein called PCSK9. In earlier studies, both drugs cut levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol by up to two thirds, although Amgen’s AMG 145 had been tested in healthy volunteers taking no other cholesterol medicines, while Regeneron’s REGN 727 was tested in patients with high cholesterol that also took statins. Amgen on Sunday reported its first results from an early-stage trial of AMG 145 in patients with high cholesterol also taking statins, and impressive findings were seen in those getting injections every two weeks or every month. In the 51-patient study, patients receiving monthly injections of AMG 145 and taking low to moderate doses of statins had up to a two-thirds reduction in LDL cholesterol by the eighth week of the study. “We gave two doses four weeks apart and at the eighth week there was minimal tapering off” of the drug’s potency, Clapton Dias, Amgen’s medical services director, said in an interview. “The 66-percent reduction of LDL was maintained.” In patients receiving injections of AMG 145 every two weeks in combination with low to moderate doses of statins, LDL reductions of up to 75 percent were seen after six weeks, Amgen said. Those taking the Amgen drug every two weeks in combination with high doses of statins had LDL reductions of up to 63 percent. Data from the Phase 1 study were presented at the annual scientific sessions of the American College of Cardiology being held in Chicago. Researchers on Monday are slated to release the full data from a Phase II study of REGN 727, which Regeneron is developing in partnership with French drugmaker Sanofi. The findings will better enable investors to size up the pros and cons of the rival therapies. Neither drug has so far shown any serious side effects in clinical trials. Dias said the ability of drugs like AMG 145 to slash LDL beyond decreases attributed to statins such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor could help enable millions of heart patients to finally get their cholesterol levels tightly controlled. “A good 60 percent of high-risk patients in the United States are unable to meet their aggressive goals of getting LDL levels down” to target levels, Dias said, making them prime candidates for AMG 145 if it continues to do well in trials and is approved. Steven Nissen, head of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, said anti-PCSK9 drugs, when used with statins, could eventually have a profound impact. “If these drugs come to market, just about everyone with high cholesterol will be able to get to goal,” Nissen said, with the possible exception of “several hundred” people with rare genetic conditions that would not benefit. Industry analysts says PCSK9 inhibitors, if approved, could generate annual sales approaching $20 billion. Nissen cautioned, however, that larger trials are needed to assess the safety of AMG 145 and REGN 727. He said a big question that remains is whether U.S. regulators would approve the drugs without first requiring major studies that evaluate long-term heart attack and stroke risk. “That’s the subtle wrinkle here,” said Nissen, who speculated the U.S. Food and Drug Administration might be willing to approve them without such costly outcomes trials because statins were approved without them on the basis of their ability to lower cholesterol. Nissen said statins and the PCSK9 inhibitors, although different classes of medicines, both exert their influence on the LDL receptor - a protein that carries LDL cholesterol through the bloodstream. “So one could argue that PCSK9 uses the same pathway as statins,” he said, a consideration that might score points with the FDA. A four-week dosing schedule might be “modestly more attractive” to patients and doctors than injections every two weeks, Nissen said. “But the frequency is not a make or break consideration,” he added, because patients would be able to inject themselves with the same types of tiny needles that are already widely used and accepted for other conditions, including diabetes.

53,AMGN,Regeneron cholesterol drug faces sudden challenge,"* Regeneron drug cuts LDL up to 75 pct at 2-week dosing * Researcher says potency waned with 4-week dosing * Success of Amgen drug at 4-week dosing poses challenge By Ransdell Pierson CHICAGO, March 26 (Reuters) - A new type of drug being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc slashed levels of cholesterol almost in half when given every four weeks, but fell short of reductions reported a day earlier with once-monthly injections of Amgen Inc’s rival product. Both monoclonal antibodies work by blocking a protein called PCSK9, and are shaping up to be the next big thing in preventing heart attack and stroke. Wall Street expects the new class of drugs, including those in earlier stages of development at Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, to generate annual future sales of up to $20 billion. Regeneron is developing its entry, called REGN 727, in partnership with French drugmaker Sanofi. The product, which has completed mid-stage trials and is heading toward far larger Phase III studies, has been considered to be the clear front runner. Amgen’s drug, AMG 145, is just entering mid-stage studies and is considered about a year behind REGN 727 in development. Although it is far less-known than the Regeneron antibody, stellar results from a Phase I trial of the Amgen product raised its profile considerably when reported on Sunday at the annual sessions of the American College of Cardiology in Chicago. In the 51-patient study, patients receiving monthly injections of AMG 145 and taking low to moderate doses of statins had up to a 66 percent reduction in “bad” LDL cholesterol by the eighth week of the study. “We gave two doses, four weeks apart, and at the eighth week there was minimal tapering off” of the drug’s potency, Clapton Dias, Amgen’s medical services director, told Reuters. By contrast, data presented Monday at the Chicago heart meeting showed that the effect of REGN 727 in a mid-stage trial, when given at high doses every four weeks, tapered off unacceptably. “The cholesterol lowering was consistent at two weeks, but at four weeks you could see effectiveness of the drug begin to wane,” its lead researcher, James McKenney, said in an interview. “LDL began to come back up,” said McKenney, who is chief executive officer of Richmond, Virginia-based testing company National Clinical Research. He speculated that future late-stage trials of REGN 727 will therefore likely be built around two-week dosing. Given every two weeks, the Regeneron drug cut LDL levels up to 72 percent, McKenney said. That is roughly in line with maximum reductions of 75 percent seen with AMG 145. No serious side effects have been reported for either medicine. The conventional wisdom in the pharmaceutical industry is that drugs given infrequently — once a day instead of twice daily, or monthly as opposed to biweekly — have a decided commercial advantage because of their greater convenience to patients. It applies especially to injectable drugs. Steven Nissen, head cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, on Sunday said those assumptions are breaking down as more injectable biotech medicines come to market. He said he did not believe less-frequent dosing would render a big advantage to either of the two companies. A four-week dosing schedule may be “modestly more attractive” to patients and doctors than injections every two weeks, Nissen said in an interview at the heart conference. “But the frequency is not a make-or-break consideration,” he added, because patients would be able to inject themselves with the same types of tiny needles that are already widely used and accepted for other conditions, including diabetes. Although it did not pan out for monthly dosing, McKenney said REGN 727 had “remarkable” and persistent potency when patients received injections every two weeks along with one of three available daily doses of Pfizer Inc’s statin Lipitor. Those receiving 50 milligram doses of Lipitor achieved an additional 40 percent reduction in LDL cholesterol, beyond that seen with patients taking Lipitor alone. He said 64 percent and 72 percent reductions in LDL were seen among patients who received, respectively, 100 milligram or 150 milligram daily doses of Lipitor. “Forty percent, 64 percent, 72 percent reductions. I’m saying, ‘Wow!’ — I’ve never seen anything like this,” McKenney said, recalling his excitement when data from the Regeneron-sponsored trial became unblinded. “In three decades of doing clinical research in the cardiovascular field, this is the most impressive drug I’ve ever seen, so I have great hope this could be a breakthrough.” McKenney said REGN 727 and Lipitor, when taken together virtually guarantee that patients will achieve their cholesterol-lowering goals. “You’ve taken it to the limit. You can’t lower LDL cholesterol any more than bringing these drugs together.” But a growing number of drugmakers, including Amgen, can be expected in coming years to challenge McKenney’s thesis.",3262012,http://www.reuters.com/article/heart-cholesterol-pcsk9/regeneron-cholesterol-drug-faces-sudden-challenge-idUSL2E8EQ45G20120326

55,AMGN,"In cancer science, many ""discoveries"" don't hold up","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former researcher at Amgen Inc has found that many basic studies on cancer — a high proportion of them from university labs — are unreliable, with grim consequences for producing new medicines in the future. During a decade as head of global cancer research at Amgen, C. Glenn Begley identified 53 “landmark” publications — papers in top journals, from reputable labs — for his team to reproduce. Begley sought to double-check the findings before trying to build on them for drug development. Result: 47 of the 53 could not be replicated. He described his findings in a commentary piece published on Wednesday in the journal Nature. “It was shocking,” said Begley, now senior vice president of privately held biotechnology company TetraLogic, which develops cancer drugs. “These are the studies the pharmaceutical industry relies on to identify new targets for drug development. But if you’re going to place a $1 million or $2 million or $5 million bet on an observation, you need to be sure it’s true. As we tried to reproduce these papers we became convinced you can’t take anything at face value.” The failure to win “the war on cancer” has been blamed on many factors, from the use of mouse models that are irrelevant to human cancers to risk-averse funding agencies. But recently a new culprit has emerged: too many basic scientific discoveries, done in animals or cells growing in lab dishes and meant to show the way to a new drug, are wrong. Begley’s experience echoes a report from scientists at Bayer AG last year. Neither group of researchers alleges fraud, nor would they identify the research they had tried to replicate. But they and others fear the phenomenon is the product of a skewed system of incentives that has academics cutting corners to further their careers. George Robertson of Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia previously worked at Merck on neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s. While at Merck, he also found many academic studies that did not hold up. “It drives people in industry crazy. Why are we seeing a collapse of the pharma and biotech industries? One possibility is that academia is not providing accurate findings,” he said. Over the last two decades, the most promising route to new cancer drugs has been one pioneered by the discoverers of Gleevec, the Novartis drug that targets a form of leukemia, and Herceptin, Genentech’s breast-cancer drug. In each case, scientists discovered a genetic change that turned a normal cell into a malignant one. Those findings allowed them to develop a molecule that blocks the cancer-producing process. This approach led to an explosion of claims of other potential “druggable” targets. Amgen tried to replicate the new papers before launching its own drug-discovery projects. Scientists at Bayer did not have much more success. In a 2011 paper titled, “Believe it or not,” they analyzed in-house projects that built on “exciting published data” from basic science studies. “Often, key data could not be reproduced,” wrote Khusru Asadullah, vice president and head of target discovery at Bayer HealthCare in Berlin, and colleagues. Of 47 cancer projects at Bayer during 2011, less than one-quarter could reproduce previously reported findings, despite the efforts of three or four scientists working full time for up to a year. Bayer dropped the projects. Bayer and Amgen found that the prestige of a journal was no guarantee a paper would be solid. “The scientific community assumes that the claims in a preclinical study can be taken at face value,” Begley and Lee Ellis of MD Anderson Cancer Center wrote in Nature. It assumes, too, that “the main message of the paper can be relied on ... Unfortunately, this is not always the case.” When the Amgen replication team of about 100 scientists could not confirm reported results, they contacted the authors. Those who cooperated discussed what might account for the inability of Amgen to confirm the results. Some let Amgen borrow antibodies and other materials used in the original study or even repeat experiments under the original authors’ direction. Some authors required the Amgen scientists sign a confidentiality agreement barring them from disclosing data at odds with the original findings. “The world will never know” which 47 studies — many of them highly cited — are apparently wrong, Begley said. The most common response by the challenged scientists was: “you didn’t do it right.” Indeed, cancer biology is fiendishly complex, noted Phil Sharp, a cancer biologist and Nobel laureate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Even in the most rigorous studies, the results might be reproducible only in very specific conditions, Sharp explained: “A cancer cell might respond one way in one set of conditions and another way in different conditions. I think a lot of the variability can come from that.” Other scientists worry that something less innocuous explains the lack of reproducibility. Part way through his project to reproduce promising studies, Begley met for breakfast at a cancer conference with the lead scientist of one of the problematic studies. “We went through the paper line by line, figure by figure,” said Begley. “I explained that we re-did their experiment 50 times and never got their result. He said they’d done it six times and got this result once, but put it in the paper because it made the best story. It’s very disillusioning.” Such selective publication is just one reason the scientific literature is peppered with incorrect results. For one thing, basic science studies are rarely “blinded” the way clinical trials are. That is, researchers know which cell line or mouse got a treatment or had cancer. That can be a problem when data are subject to interpretation, as a researcher who is intellectually invested in a theory is more likely to interpret ambiguous evidence in its favor. The problem goes beyond cancer. On Tuesday, a committee of the National Academy of Sciences heard testimony that the number of scientific papers that had to be retracted increased more than tenfold over the last decade; the number of journal articles published rose only 44 percent. Ferric Fang of the University of Washington, speaking to the panel, said he blamed a hypercompetitive academic environment that fosters poor science and even fraud, as too many researchers compete for diminishing funding. “The surest ticket to getting a grant or job is getting published in a high-profile journal,” said Fang. “This is an unhealthy belief that can lead a scientist to engage in sensationalism and sometimes even dishonest behavior.” The academic reward system discourages efforts to ensure a finding was not a fluke. Nor is there an incentive to verify someone else’s discovery. As recently as the late 1990s, most potential cancer-drug targets were backed by 100 to 200 publications. Now each may have fewer than half a dozen. “If you can write it up and get it published you’re not even thinking of reproducibility,” said Ken Kaitin, director of the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development. “You make an observation and move on. There is no incentive to find out it was wrong.” (Note: Amgen researcher C.

56,AMGN,"Amgen, Astra to collaborate on several drugs","(Reuters) - Amgen Inc and British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc announced on Monday a major collaboration deal to jointly develop and sell five biotech drugs currently in Amgen’s developmental pipeline. Under terms of the deal, Astra will make an upfront payment of $50 million to the world’s largest biotechnology company, and the companies will share costs and profits on the drugs for a variety of autoimmune, inflammatory and respiratory diseases. The collaboration will provide Amgen with additional resources to help advance its product portfolio and give Astra access to new medicines at a time when its own pipeline is relatively barren and it is facing competition from cheap generic versions of its big-selling antipsychotic drug Seroquel. The deal comes as Amgen’s longtime chief executive, Kevin Sharer, is preparing to step down next month. “We have a lot of things that we want to move forward and there are financial constraints everywhere with how much you can do,” Joe Miletich, Amgen’s senior vice president for research and development, said in a telephone interview. “We get some financial relief for moving these assets forward and we can tap into some strong areas of expertise that AstraZeneca has,” Miletich added. Astra has extensive experience selling respiratory treatments, which would be a new area for Amgen. Sanford Bernstein biotech analyst Geoffrey Porges questioned the selection of AstraZeneca as Amgen’s partner and the partnering strategy itself. “It’s hard to see what AstraZeneca brings to the table other than cash and the ability for Amgen to maintain their share buybacks and dividends,” Porges said, conceding that Astra does provide some global commercial reach that Amgen lacks. “The fact that Amgen has to partner yet another one of their strategic initiatives isn’t really going to fill investors with very much confidence,” said Porges, who was critical of Amgen’s decision to collaborate with Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc on the development of generic biotech drugs, or biosimilars. Recent AstraZeneca setbacks with experimental medicines for depression, ovarian cancer and diabetes have hurt investor confidence in the company’s ability to rejuvenate its pipeline internally. In an interview last month, research chief Martin Mackay told Reuters that Astra was actively seeking deals, “including potential peer-to-peer and biotech deals. AstraZeneca expects revenue to fall by more than 10 percent in 2012 and it has twice cut its 2014 outlook, with new drugs expected to contribute a lot less than initial estimates. The most advanced of the five drugs to be shared by Amgen and Astra is brodalumab, which is about to begin Phase III clinical trials for psoriasis, and is also being tested for psoriatic arthritis and asthma. The others, all at a much earlier stage of development, are AMG 139 for Crohn’s disease; AMG 181 for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s; AMG 557 for lupus; and AMG 157 for asthma. Under current plans, about 65 percent of the costs through 2014 will be funded by AstraZeneca, after which the companies will split costs equally. Amgen will book sales globally and retain a low single-digit royalty for brodalumab and a mid single-digit royalty for the rest of the portfolio. After 2014, the companies will share profits equally. Astra will take the lead for development and commercial strategy of AMG 139, AMG 157 and AMG 181, while Amgen will lead the development and commercial strategy for brodalumab and AMG 557, the companies said. There will be a joint collaboration committee with representatives of both companies on all five projects.

57,AMGN,"Amgen, Astra to collaborate on several drugs","(Reuters) - Amgen Inc and British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc announced on Monday a major collaboration deal to jointly develop and sell five biotech drugs currently in Amgen’s developmental pipeline. Under terms of the deal, Astra will make an upfront payment of $50 million to the world’s largest biotechnology company, and the companies will share costs and profits on the drugs for a variety of autoimmune, inflammatory and respiratory diseases. The collaboration will provide Amgen with additional resources to help advance its product portfolio and give Astra access to new medicines at a time when its own pipeline is relatively barren and it is facing competition from cheap generic versions of its big-selling antipsychotic drug Seroquel. The deal comes as Amgen’s longtime chief executive, Kevin Sharer, is preparing to step down next month. “We have a lot of things that we want to move forward and there are financial constraints everywhere with how much you can do,” Joe Miletich, Amgen’s senior vice president for research and development, said in a telephone interview. “We get some financial relief for moving these assets forward and we can tap into some strong areas of expertise that AstraZeneca has,” Miletich added. Astra has extensive experience selling respiratory treatments, which would be a new area for Amgen. Sanford Bernstein biotech analyst Geoffrey Porges questioned the selection of AstraZeneca as Amgen’s partner and the partnering strategy itself. “It’s hard to see what AstraZeneca brings to the table other than cash and the ability for Amgen to maintain their share buybacks and dividends,” Porges said, conceding that Astra does provide some global commercial reach that Amgen lacks. “The fact that Amgen has to partner yet another one of their strategic initiatives isn’t really going to fill investors with very much confidence,” said Porges, who was critical of Amgen’s decision to collaborate with Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc on the development of generic biotech drugs, or biosimilars. Recent AstraZeneca setbacks with experimental medicines for depression, ovarian cancer and diabetes have hurt investor confidence in the company’s ability to rejuvenate its pipeline internally. In an interview last month, research chief Martin Mackay told Reuters that Astra was actively seeking deals, “including potential peer-to-peer and biotech deals.” AstraZeneca expects revenue to fall by more than 10 percent in 2012 and it has twice cut its 2014 outlook, with new drugs expected to contribute a lot less than initial estimates. The most advanced of the five drugs to be shared by Amgen and Astra is brodalumab, which is about to begin Phase III clinical trials for psoriasis, and is also being tested for psoriatic arthritis and asthma. The others, all at a much earlier stage of development, are AMG 139 for Crohn’s disease; AMG 181 for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s; AMG 557 for lupus; and AMG 157 for asthma. Under current plans, about 65 percent of the costs through 2014 will be funded by AstraZeneca, after which the companies will split costs equally. Amgen will book sales globally and retain a low single-digit royalty for brodalumab and a mid single-digit royalty for the rest of the portfolio. After 2014, the companies will share profits equally. Astra will take the lead for development and commercial strategy of AMG 139, AMG 157 and AMG 181, while Amgen will lead the development and commercial strategy for brodalumab and AMG 557, the companies said. There will be a joint collaboration committee with representatives of both companies on all five projects. The cost sharing will enable Amgen to fund some other projects that it might otherwise have been forced to abandon, Miletich said. “We still have many more things that we’re still moving on our own, and this actually will help free some resources so we can continue to innovate in bringing some of the programs in our earlier pipeline along in a way that might not have been possible if we were funding these all on our own,” Miletich said.

58,AMGN,AstraZeneca hunting more deals like Amgen tie-up,"LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca is seeking more deals to fill its sparse drug pipeline like the one just signed with Amgen, but is not in the market for the kind of large acquisition some investors have speculated about. Martin Mackay, head of research at Britain’s second-biggest drugmaker, said he was considering smaller acquisitions, product licensing deals and more partnerships with industry peers. The deal with Amgen buys rights to jointly develop and sell five of the U.S. biotech firm’s experimental autoimmune, inflammatory and respiratory drugs, and follows a similar tie-up in diabetes five years ago with Bristol-Myers Squibb. AstraZeneca also struck a deal two years ago with Rigel Pharmaceuticals, worth up to $1.2 billion in milestone payments, for an experimental rheumatoid arthritis drug. “This gives you a flavour of the type of things we’re looking at,” Mackay said in a telephone interview. “I like the deals we’ve got with Bristol, with Rigel and with Amgen, and we’re looking to do more of these kinds of deals. It can involve smaller acquisitions ... but the notion of a mega-deal is not part of our strategy.” The Amgen tie-up, announced on Monday, involves an upfront payment of $50 million. The final price, however, will be many times that as the British company will fund 65 percent of the drugs’ development costs through 2014. Mackay said the investment in the Amgen deal would be “significant” but he declined to confirm an estimate from Panmure Gordon analyst Savvas Neophytou that costs would be in the region of $250 million a year in 2013 and 2014. Recent AstraZeneca setbacks with experimental medicines for depression, ovarian cancer and diabetes have hurt investor confidence in the company’s ability to rejuvenate its pipeline internally. The drugmaker expects revenue to fall by more than 10 percent in 2012 as it struggles with generic competition to the blockbuster antipsychotic Seroquel, as well as pressure on cholesterol fighter Crestor from cheaper pills. With few new drugs in the pipeline, it has previously signaled a willingness to do deals in the low billions of dollars to bring in promising products from outside. For some investors that has set the alarm bells ringing and fuelled speculation that it might end up doing something much larger. But Mackay stressed he still envisaged a piecemeal approach, involving a string of deals rather than one quick fix. “I’d be disappointed if by the end of 2012 we haven’t announced more deals,” he added. One company AstraZeneca has been linked with in takeover talk recently is diabetes specialist Amylin Pharmaceuticals, which Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said recently could make an attractive bolt-on acquisition. Speculation about the future of Amylin has increased in the last week, after Bloomberg News reported the company rejected a $3.5 billion unsolicited takeover bid from Bristol-Myers Squibb. Mackay declined to comment on whether AstraZeneca might bid for the business or, alternatively, seek a deal to sell Amylin’s new diabetes treatment Bydureon outside the United States, although he noted AstraZeneca had done regional distribution deals in the past and was ready to look at new ones.

59,AMGN,"Drug sales, share buybacks help Amgen's first-quarter","(Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) posted a better-than-expected first-quarter profit as sales of arthritis drug Enbrel grew and the biotechnology company bought back more of its shares. But Amgen left its full-year outlook unchanged and its shares were flat after hours. “While earnings were better than expected, product results were generally in line overall and with guidance maintained and suggesting limited growth in subsequent quarters, we view the quarter as neutral,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Jim Birchenough wrote in a note to investors. Amgen, which has seen stalled earnings growth as safety concerns clipped sales of its flagship anemia drugs, will have a new chief executive officer next month when current Chief Operating Officer Bob Bradway moves into the post and CEO Kevin Sharer retires. “We will be looking to drive the business by bringing forward innovative medicines that make a difference for patients that are seriously ill and in addition be looking to grow the business internationally,” Bradway said on a conference call with analysts and investors. He said growth would come internally and from business development activities like the company’s recent acquisitions of cancer drug developer Micromet Inc and kidney disease drug developer KAI Pharmaceuticals. Sources have said Amgen is one of several drugmakers seeking to acquire Turkey’s Mustafa Nevzat Ilac Sanayi, which makes injectable generic drugs. The Wall Street Journal reported that a $700 million deal could be announced on Wednesday. Bradway said Amgen is interested in expanding in emerging markets, including Turkey, Mexico, China and Russia. The company said it would initiate several late-stage clinical trials this year, which will increase research costs. It will not unveil, as previously suggested, interim results from a pivotal melanoma vaccine trial. Instead, final results will be released to the public in 2013, said Sean Harper, the company’s head of research and development. “It was a solid quarter, but maybe not quite as good as the headlines read,” said Cowen & Co analyst Eric Schmidt. “I think much of the upside to the top line came from other revenue, not product sales ... The other reason for the better EPS was, of course, the share count reduction.” Amgen said it bought back around 21 million shares in the first quarter, leaving $3.6 billion authorized under its current stock repurchase program. Over the past year, the company has stepped up efforts to return cash to shareholders by buying back shares and initiating dividend payments. Excluding items such as acquisition expenses and non-cash interest, the world’s largest biotech company earned $1.61 per share in the first quarter, beating the average Wall Street forecast of $1.45, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income rose 5 percent to $1.18 billion. Quarterly product sales climbed 8 percent to $3.9 billion, helped by Enbrel sales of $938 million, which beat the consensus forecast of $903 million, according to numbers compiled by BMO Capital Markets. Sales of white blood cell-boosters Neupogen and Neulasta totaled $1.34 billion, also beating the consensus forecast of $1.30 billion. Sales of newer drug Xgeva, used for preventing fractures in cancer that has spread to the bones, rose 14 percent from the prior quarter to $153 million, but the closely-watched total fell short of analysts’ average forecast of $159 million. The Thousand Oaks, California, company said its adjusted tax rate for the first quarter fell to 15.6 percent from 16.6 percent a year earlier due mainly to expenses, an adjustment to the U.S. healthcare reform fee and foreign tax credits. For the full year, the company said it still expects to earn $5.90 to $6.15 per share on revenue of $16.1 billion to $16.5 billion, excluding items. Wall Street is estimating full-year earnings of $6.07 per share and revenue of $16.25 billion. Shares of Amgen, which have gained 28 percent over the past 12 months, closed up 34 cents at $68.63 on Nasdaq.

60,AMGN,"Analysis: New Amgen CEO must win investors with payouts, deals","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Bob Bradway hasn’t even taken the helm at Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), but the clock is already ticking on how the world’s largest biotech will compete with rivals, including Big Pharma. Powerful value investors, who helped push up the stock 26 percent since it took a page from traditional drug companies last year with a dividend payout and stock buyback plan, are clamoring for more. But other shareholders still hope Amgen can keep growing, possibly by spending some of the firm’s pile of cash to bulk up the pipeline of new drugs. The stakes for Bradway - a former Morgan Stanley investment banker who takes over as Amgen chief executive on May 23 - could not be higher. Some industry experts warn that the bedrock of California biotech could be for sale if he fails to drive revenue and its share price higher. “If nothing comes out of the pipeline, then the company is going to be rolled into a bigger, global diversified company,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges. “That tends to be the nature of this industry. I don’t think the time is right for that now ... but sooner or later investors are going to ask: What have you done for me lately?” Earnings growth at the Thousand Oaks, California-based company has stalled in recent years, hurt by safety concerns linked to overuse of its anemia drugs Epogen and Aranesp. Amgen will report its latest quarterly results on Tuesday. Of the 29 Wall Street analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters, 16 rate the $53 billion biotech company as “hold,” six rate it as a “strong buy,” five as “buy,” with one each at “underperform,” and “sell.” Its market valuation is in line with those of the most well-entrenched and slower growing traditional drugmakers, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and Merck & Co (MRK.N). Amgen is valued at 11 times estimated 2012 earnings. The average price to earnings ratio for the pharmaceutical industry is just over 12, compared with more than 32 for the biotech industry. Amgen’s current growth driver is bone drug denosumab - sold under the brand names Prolia for osteoporosis and Xgeva for cancer patients. Another bone drug has just moved into a pivotal-stage trial. An experimental cholesterol-lowering drug in a new class known as PCSK9 inhibitors has shown promise, but it has yet to be tested in a large-scale trial. “This is an excellent opportunity for the new CEO to come in with a new slate and a new take on getting more innovation out of their pipeline,” said Morningstar analyst Karen Anderson. Amgen’s need for new drugs is particularly acute given expected new competition, both branded and generic, for its biggest-selling products. The same is true of the drug industry as a whole, and Amgen faces a crowded field of potential suitors for many desirable takeover targets, driving up deal prices. Amgen spent close to $1.2 billion earlier this year to acquire Micromet and its technology for linking cell-destroying T-cells to cancerous tumors, paying a 33 percent premium. Last year, it acquired privately-held BioVex, which also developed drugs aiming to harness the immune system to fight cancer. Both are seen as legacies of Roger Perlmutter, Amgen’s long-time research and development chief who was replaced in February by Sean Harper, previously the company’s chief medical officer. Initial results from a pivotal trial of the BioVex melanoma vaccine are expected late this year, but most of Amgen’s pipeline products are still in earlier stages of human testing. “Amgen has a relatively large and deep product pipeline, however, we do not think many of the products are good,” Stifel Nicolaus analyst Joel Sendek said in a March research report. If that is indeed the case, the company will need to bring in more drug candidates, either through licensing deals or a more aggressive acquisition strategy. “They are likely to announce a more focused, strategic R&D; strategy which includes more in-licensing, acquisitions and focusing on their core strength,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee. “I don’t see the company undergoing a major restructuring and divesting drugs.” He and others say Amgen’s spending on R&D;, nearly 20 percent of sales revenue, is too high. “If you kind of put them in the bucket of mature pharma companies, that model has been cutting back on spending,” said David Heupel, senior equity research analyst at Thrivent Financial, which holds Amgen shares. “Amgen spends more like a growth company, but given the mature nature of most of their products, it’s hard to move the top line.” A recent partnership under which AstraZeneca (AZN.L) will share the cost of developing five of Amgen’s inflammation-targeting antibodies is seen as a signal that the California company aims to streamline. In the meantime, the temptation may be high to stick to a “shareholder friendly” strategy of paying out its cash. Amgen’s share price, flat for most of current CEO Kevin Sharer’s more than 10-year tenure, has risen 26 percent since the company announced its first dividend a year ago, compared with an 18 percent gain for the Nasdaq biotech index .NBI. Investors also cheered a $5 billion share buyback last year. Amgen is authorized to repurchase another $5 billion in shares and investors are betting that, with 2011 revenue of $15.6 billion, it will raise the dividend payout further. “Just give me a good dividend increase each year and I am as happy as a clam at high tide,” said Bill Smead, portfolio manager of the Smead Value Fund, which owns 32,784 shares of Amgen. “People are learning that that is how you attract shareholders.” He also expects Amgen’s stock to benefit as record-low interest rates inevitably start rising, and cash-rich companies not dependent on borrowing come back into favor. At the end of 2011, Amgen held $20.6 billion in worldwide cash and marketable securities, spurring speculation that some of that money could be used to acquire other companies. RBC’s Yee said a company like Ariad Pharmaceuticals ARIA.O, which has later-stage candidates for treating leukemia and lung cancer, would be a good synergistic fit with Amgen. “They need to focus on drugs that could come to market in 2013 or 2014,” Yee said. “I don’t expect them to do a transforming acquisition.” Since most of its cash hoard sits overseas, acquisition of a foreign company would be less of a tax hit to Amgen, which has said publicly it is seeking to expand its geographic footprint. That has driven speculation that Belgian drugmaker UCB (UCB.BR) or Swiss biotech Actelion ATLN.VX may be in its sights. “The question is how is the new CEO going to take a look at M&A; and how that fits into Amgen’s strategy,” said Thrivent Financial’s Heupel.

62,AMGN,Amgen to buy Turkish drugmaker for $700 million,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. biotech company Amgen is to buy Turkey’s Mustafa Nevzat Pharmaceuticals, a maker of injectable generic drugs, for around $700 million in a deal underscoring Western drugmakers’ thirst for emerging markets sales. The purchase, announced by both companies on Wednesday, is the latest in a string of acquisitions by international drug companies - both at home and abroad - as they try to buy growth to offset patent expiries and price cuts. Sales of pharmaceuticals are growing faster in emerging markets than in Europe and the United States, making them attractive to companies like Amgen. Later on Wednesday, Watson Pharmaceuticals is expected to announce a deal to buy Swiss-based Actavis for around $6 billion, helping it compete against larger rivals and also increasing its exposure to emerging markets. At the same time, companies like GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca are stepping up their drive to acquire smaller biotechnology companies with promising new drugs to improve their pipelines of high-priced patented medicines. Under the all-cash agreement between Amgen and MN Pharma, Amgen will acquire 95.6 percent of the shares in the privately held Turkish company for an amount that values MN Pharma at $700 million. “Together with MN’s staff and management team, we plan to grow our business with high quality and innovative medicines in Turkey and the surrounding region,” said Amgen Chief Operating Officer Bob Bradway. Bradway will step into the position of chief executive officer next month when current CEO Kevin Sharer retires. People familiar with the situation said Amgen competed with a number of rivals to acquire the Istanbul-based firm, although Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline - seen at one stage seen as a strong contender - was not interested in the end. MN Pharma came into play as a takeover target after Eli Lilly discussed a possible partnership deal last summer. But those one-on-one discussions finally fell apart, prompting the family owners of MN Pharma to start the wider auction process. The owners hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch as adviser on the sale. MN Pharma is the leading supplier of drugs to the hospital sector in Turkey and a major supplier of injectable products. It also has a fast-growing export business. MN Pharma said in a statement that revenue totaled around $200 million in 2011 and it had been growing on average at more than 10 percent a year in local currency over the past five years. MN Pharma is one of the leading and oldest pharmaceutical companies in Turkey. It was established in 1923 by Mustafa Nevzat Pısak and was the first Turkish drug company to be granted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and finished dosage forms of medicines in 2006. It has a workforce of 1,200. Past Turkish drug deals include Zentiva, a Czech drugmaker bought by Sanofi in 2009, acquiring 75 percent of the generic drug unit of Turkey’s Eczacibasi in 2007 for 460 million euros ($607 million). It later bought out the remaining 25 percent.

63,AMGN,FDA rejects Amgen's application for Xgeva,"(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators rejected the application by Amgen Inc, the world’s biggest biotechnology company, to expand the use of the drug Xgeva to delay the spread of tumors to the bone in patients suffering from advanced prostate cancer. Xgeva and a related osteoporosis drug Prolia are seen as among the most important growth drivers for Amgen and may help offset declining sales of anemia drugs, analysts say. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that the risks outweigh the effect of the proposed application and has asked for data from adequate and well-controlled trials, Amgen said. Xgeva is already approved to prevent fractures in patients with advanced prostate cancer that has migrated to the bone. Amgen is seeking additional approval for use to postpone or prevent the cancer’s spread. The FDA rejected the expanded use of the injectable drug, known chemically as denosumab, after an advisory panel voted against it because of its links to a jawbone-destroying condition. “We will work with FDA to determine any next steps,” said Sean Harper, executive vice president of research and development at Amgen. The FDA’s action does not impact the approved indication of Xgeva in the prevention of fractures in men suffering from advanced prostate cancer, Harper said. In the first quarter of 2012, sales of Xgeva rose 14 percent from the prior quarter to $153 million, and it is expected to eventually become a $1 billion-a-year drug. The company said the new use for Xgeva would be targeted at about 50,000 men in the United States in the advanced stage of prostate cancer. Amgen said it was also testing Xgeva in other cancers, including breast and lung cancer. Shares of Amgen closed up 0.85 percent at $70.79 on Nasdaq.

67,AMGN,UK watchdog revises Amgen bone drug guidance,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s healthcare cost watchdog has had second thoughts about using Amgen’s new bone drug Xgeva, or denosumab, and now says it does not believe it should be offered on the state health service to prostate cancer patients. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) had in March recommended the drug for breast and prostate cancer patients whose disease has spread to the bone. But in light of fresh information from clinical experts, the agency said on Tuesday it no longer believed Xgeva represented a cost-effective choice in treating prostate cancer. The decision is due to revised thinking on the appropriate comparator treatments for Xgeva, which is an alternative to older bone-strengthening bisphosphonate drugs. Expert evidence showed that while bisphosphonates helped prevent bone damage in breast cancer, they were mainly used for pain relief in prostate cancer, a NICE spokeswoman said. The latest version of NICE’s draft guidance is now open for comment. ",6112012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-amgen-britain/uk-watchdog-revises-amgen-bone-drug-guidance-idUSBRE85A1M020120611

69,AMGN,Exclusive: Human Genome rejected Amgen's $7 billion bid in 2010: sources,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Amgen Inc, the world’s largest biotech company, had offered to acquire Human Genome Sciences Inc for $35 per share two years ago, but the preliminary $7 billion bid was rejected by its smaller U.S. rival, two people familiar with the situation said on Thursday. Amgen, at the time, was hunting aggressively for potential acquisitions to reinvigorate its product portfolio. Human Genome, which last week agreed to be bought by British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc for $14.25 per share — or $3 billion — said in a filing with regulators last week that the company had received, and rebuffed, a preliminary takeover bid at $35 per share in August 2010. It did not identify the prospective buyer. News of the $35 per share offer suggests GSK played its hand well by biding its time before pouncing on its long-time partner when the stock was down in the dumps earlier this year. Human Genome’s board, consulted by its advisers at the time, decided not to pursue a sale at the proposed price, given that regulatory approval for Benlysta — the first new treatment for lupus in 50 years — was expected later in 2010, the company said in the filing last week. According to the people familiar with the situation, Amgen was the company that made that approach in 2010. The people asked not to be identified because the matter was not public. Representatives for Amgen declined to comment. Human Genome did not return calls for a comment. Amgen itself proved uninterested when invited back by Human Genome as a potential “white knight” to fend off GSK’s initial unsolicited approach in April this year. According to the filing by Human Genome, the company received a letter from an unnamed third party on August 3, 2010, indicating its “preliminary interest in pursuing a possible acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of the company at a price of $35.00 per share in cash.” The offer was declined around a week later, the filing shows. Times, of course, were different then. Human Genome was still riding high on hopes for Benlysta — rights to which are shared equally with GSK — and the stock closed at $26.33 on August 2, 2010. Benlysta went on to win approval by the Food and Drug Administration in March 2011, though early sales since its launch have disappointed investors and Human Genome’s shares have plummeted since. “The company then believed that its best long-term strategic alternative was to remain an independent company and pursue the commercialization of Benlysta and the development of the other products then in its pipeline,” Human Genome said in the filing. “Following the receipt of the $13.00 Offer from GSK, that third party declined the company’s invitation to participate in the company’s strategic alternative review process,” Human Genome added. The U.S. pioneer of gene-based drug discovery was formed 20 years ago with the mission to isolate genes and identify their function in order to develop new drugs. Over the years it has had a rollercoaster ride as hopes for its drugs have waxed and waned. Human Genome, whose shares touched as high as $30 last year, were trading at around $7 just before GSK’s initial $13 per share offer was made public on April 19. The British drugmaker eventually sweetened its offer to $14.25 per share to clinch the deal. GSK’s successful offer may have represented a 99 percent premium to the price before it stepped into the fray, but it is still a bargain compared with what Amgen was ready to pay. Amgen’s then-CEO, Kevin Sharer, told a Goldman Sachs conference in June 2010 that he was “aggressively” looking at acquisitions. “We will take a risk in acquisitions, but it will be a measured risk. It sure won’t be a bet-the-company risk,” he said at the time. For Amgen, with a market value of some $60 billion, Human Genome would certainly have fitted the bill as a significant, if not transformational, bolt-on deal. In fact, some industry analysts, including Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets, said at the time that Human Genome was the most sensible takeover target for Sharer’s acquisition-hungry team. Other companies touted as possible targets for Amgen in 2010 and into 2011 included Actelion, a Swiss biotech company with a dominant position in treating pulmonary arterial hypertension, a rare heart and lung condition.

70,AMGN,"Amgen pancreatic cancer drug lacks efficacy, trial ends","(Reuters) - Amgen Inc halted a late-stage trial of an experimental drug for pancreatic cancer after independent reviewers concluded that it was unlikely to significantly help patients. Amgen said the trial of ganitumab, also known as AMG479, did not raise any safety concerns. The company said it would also stop a separate mid-stage trial of the drug. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said he had not expected the study to succeed. “We would say that this is yet another reason why we believe Amgen needs to be more prudent with R&D; expense and raise its hurdle for go/no-go decisions in its pipeline, and that it probably should reduce its earlier-stage R&D; spend,” he said in a research note. Yee, who rates Amgen as “outperform,” said there is still a positive bias on the company’s stock because management holds the option of cutting costs and is also likely to raise dividend payments. “These disappointing results underscore the difficulty of treating pancreatic cancer, which remains an unmet medical need,” Sean Harper, head of research and development at Amgen, said in a statement. Shares of Amgen, which closed at $81.37, were trading down a fraction at $81.09 after hours.

71,AMGN,Cycling: Hamilton to lose 2004 gold on Friday - IOC source,"LONDON (Reuters) - American cyclist Tyler Hamilton will officially be stripped of his Athens 2004 Olympic gold medal on Friday as the International Olympic Committee (IOC) moves to close the case before the end of an eight-year statute of limitation, an IOC source told Reuters. The source said a disciplinary commission would issue a final ruling on the matter after the athlete, who won the time-trial gold, admitted to doping. “It will happen tomorrow,” the source said. “The commission waited to see if there was more information coming from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency that implicated other riders or their coaches from the Athens Games but there is no more coming.” Retired Russian rider Viatcheslav Ekimov is set to move up to gold with American Bobby Julich awarded silver and Michael Rogers of Australia moving up from fourth to bronze. Hamilton was initially allowed to keep his medal in 2004, after testing positive for blood doping, because the laboratory accidentally destroyed his B sample by deep-freezing it. The following year, Hamilton tested positive for a blood transfusion and was banned for two years. In 2006 he was linked to the Spanish doping scandal dubbed “Operation Puerto” before testing positive for steroids three years later. He was given an eight-year ban after he said he had taken an over-the-counter treatment for depression. In an interview last year Hamilton ended years of denials by admitting he had used performance-enhancing drugs.

72,AMGN,FDA approves Teva version of Amgen's Neupogen,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Drug regulators gave the nod to a Teva Pharmaceutical Industries drug that boosts the production of infection-fighting white blood cells in certain cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Teva’s medicine is similar to Amgen Inc’s biologic drug Neupogen, which faces the expiration of its U.S. patent next year. “While approval at this time is somewhat unexpected, we note the two drugs are not substitutable, and it will require a launch ramp and extensive marketing efforts by Teva to gain share,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said in a research note. Amgen’s U.S. sales of Neupogen were $959 million last year, while sales of Neulasta, the biotech company’s longer-lasting white blood cell booster, were $3 billion. In a settlement of patent litigation, Teva agreed last year to refrain from launching its versions of both drugs in the United States until November 2013. “Teva is prohibited by court order from marketing this product in the U.S. prior to November 10, 2013,” Amgen said in a statement. Teva already sells its version of Neupogen, or filgrastim, in the European Union, where Yee said it accounts for about 5 percent of the overall market. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Teva’s drug, called tbo-filgrastim, stimulates bone marrow to increase production of white blood cells, which may help cancer patients recover more quickly from the side effects of chemotherapy. Biotech drugs, which are derived from living matter such as proteins, are usually given by injection. The innovative drugs - first introduced in the 1980s - can cost tens of thousands of dollars a year. Copying them is much more complicated, and expensive, than duplicating conventional chemical-based compounds. The FDA earlier this year issued draft guidelines governing the process for review and approval of drugs deemed interchangeable with original biotech products. But the final rules remain uncertain and many generic drugmakers, such as Israel-based Teva, are pushing forward with biosimilar drugs using the FDA’s standard drug approval process. As global pharmaceutical companies face the loss of patent protection on many established drugs, U.S. sales of biosimilars are expected to reach $1.9 billion to $2.6 billion by 2015, according to IMS Health.

76,AMGN,Armstrong paid motorcyclist to deliver EPO,"LONDON (Reuters) - Lance Armstrong paid for a motorcyclist to deliver the banned bloodbooster EPO to him during the 1999 Tour de France, former team mate Tyler Hamilton said in a BBC radio documentary broadcast on Monday. American Armstrong, who won the Tour a record seven times from 1999 to 2005, has been stripped of his titles by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) who have accused the 41-year-old of being a central figure in an elaborate doping conspiracy. “Yeah in ‘99 we had a motorcycle driver...we had him follow the Tour around for the better part of three weeks,” said Hamilton, who was one of Armstrong’s U.S. Postal team mates from 1998 to 2001. “He’d stay close enough to where we were staying at the hotels to drop off at any key moment. “We knew other people were going to take risks so we were gonna take it too,” added Hamilton who said they put the used syringes into drinks cans before crushing them. “Lance paid him between $15,000-20,000 to do it. “Then, as Lance had won the Tour, we would all club together to buy him a Rolex watch. Somewhere out there he’s wearing a gold Rolex watch.” Hamilton, who was stripped of the 2004 Olympic time trial gold medal, gave evidence to the USADA inquiry which published its findings in a report last week and concluded Armstrong was one of the ringleaders in U.S. Postal’s sophisticated doping scheme. Armstrong has always denied taking banned substances but decided not to challenge the USADA charges. The American’s team manager during his Tour wins, Johan Bruyneel, is among four other people accused of doping violations by USADA. Bruyneel is contesting the case. Armstrong’s former soigneur (masseuse and assistant) at U.S. Postal Emma O’Reilly, who also gave evidence to USADA, told the BBC how she once drove from France to Spain to pick up some tablets for Armstrong. “I had to rent a car in France...Took six hours to drive and also that was another reason I knew it was something because Lance had said to me ‘don’t tell your boyfriend’. “I used to say to some of the soigneurs, ‘you are drug runners’, and that’s what I was being for the weekend,” added O’Reilly, who also said she once used makeup to conceal syringe marks on Armstrong before a photocall. In 2003, O’Reilly spoke to journalist David Walsh about doping for a book on Armstrong co-authored with Pierre Ballester. Armstrong sued her for libel. “Afterwards, oh my, I’ve never felt more hunted in my whole life,” said O’Reilly. “There were lawsuits that affected not just me but other people, like my boyfriend. “The libel laws protected him, the rich, while I was dragged through the courts. I knew Lance was bullying me, and all I was trying to do was clean up the sport.” British rider David Millar, banned for two years in 2004 for doping, said he was confident cycling had changed for the better. “Cycling has moved on so far in the last five years, through the incredible hard work of a lot of people who wanted to change things,” said the 35-year-old, who is a member of the World Anti-Doping Agency’s athletes’ commission. “This is a scoop to the general public, but we’ve known things for so long. If you want to make change in sport, you do it yourself. “We have to close this door on this horrific period for the sport. We have moved on. Things have got progressively better. We are at the vanguard of the anti-doping movement,” added Millar. “Cycling has pushed through the most advanced anti-doping testing and we were the first sport to introduce blood tests. The problem was so vast, and we were all culpable on different levels.” ",10152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cycling-armstrong-doping/armstrong-paid-motorcyclist-to-deliver-epo-idUSBRE89E1ER20121015
77,AMGN,"Omerta has to be broken, says Hamilton","PARIS (Reuters) - Professional cycling has long been crippled by doping and the sport will only begin to heal when its omerta, or ‘Code of Silence’, has been broken by those still in denial, according to Tyler Hamilton. American rider Hamilton is one of 11 former Lance Armstrong team mates who agreed to testify against the seven-times Tour de France winner, who was stripped of those titles and banned for life by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) in August. Hamilton retired in 2009 when he was handed an eight-year ban following a third positive test, marking the end of his “dual life” as a professional cyclist. “Don’t feel bad for me,” he warned at the beginning of a telephone interview with Reuters on Tuesday. Hamilton deplores the fact that some of his fellow riders still look the other way when it comes to doping. “I do see a lot of professionals who I raced against back then, they’re just completely denying doping themselves or (denying) seeing or hearing anything about doping,” the 41-year-old Hamilton said. “If they said they didn’t dope, ok, as far as I know they didn’t dope but saying they didn’t see or hear anything, come on... “It’s part of the problem, the omerta still exists.” Whatever other cyclists say, doping was endemic in the early 2000s and there is no way that can be denied, claims Hamilton, who gave back his 2004 Olympic gold medal after confessing to doping throughout his career. “They have to bury their heads in the sand, literally — which is impossible,” he said. Hamilton firmly believes the best solution for those in denial, and for the sport as a whole, is a complete confession, including Armstrong who has denied doping allegations for years. “I’d be surprised if he didn’t confess in some way some day because to continue with the denial, it’s a heavy, heavy weight,” he said. Hamilton himself tried to forget about his own drug cheating by just moving on with his life, but that was not enough. “I just kind of buried it deep inside me,” he said. “I really tried, I thought that with time it was going to get easier. But year after year, the improvements were so minute. “What I went through totally destroyed me. There’s a part of me that thought I’d never recover.” When Hamilton was subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury as part as a federal investigation into Armstrong in 2010, he finally ended the lie. “It’s sad to say but it finally took a subpoena... I was dreading that day (...) but I’m so grateful it happened, in a selfish way. I was a broken man,” said Hamilton. The American rode with Armstrong on the U.S. Postal Service team from 1998-2001, a period when he says cycling was riddled with doping. “The sport was so dirty at that time,” Hamilton said. “Most of the things we did were kind of the norm in cycling. He (Armstrong) made the decision to dope but he’s not 100 percent at fault. There were a lot of other people involved in this.” Hamilton is therefore urging everyone involved in cycling in the early 2000s and before to come clean — not just the riders but also the sports directors, team managers, physiotherapists and mechanics. “We need more people to come out and talk about what happened in the past,” he said. “What sickens me is the denial — those who say they didn’t know anything — the team managers, team directors, soigneurs, mechanics and riders who are still competing today or who raced back then.” Hamilton feels those in denial can still play a role in professional cycling but only if they come clean. “The guys who are 35 and older, whether they still ride today or are sports directors, they need to answer some questions,” he explained. “They are still part of the problem.” Among them is Kazakhstan’s 2012 Olympic road race champion Alexandre Vinokourov, a former doper who is taking over as the new Astana team manager next season. “I’m not saying they should leave (cycling) but if they don’t open up and be honest about what happened in the past then there is no room for them in the sport,” said Hamilton. Hamilton, who now runs a coaching company for amateur cyclists, says he bears no grudges. “I would not wish what I went through on my worst enemy, I would not wish what I went through on Lance Armstrong,” he said. “If he (Armstrong) tells the truth there will be consequences but in the long term, he’s gonna be better off. People will forgive. People don’t wanna hold grudges forever. People will forgive the guy.” ",10162012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cycling-armstrong-hamilton/omerta-has-to-be-broken-says-hamilton-idUSBRE89F1R620121016

81,AMGN,"Armstrong war of words escalates between UCI, USADA","(Reuters) - A day after Lance Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned for life, the war of words between the International Cycling Union (UCI) and the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) escalated. Though Armstrong’s exposure as a drug cheat was effectively sealed when the UCI on Monday ratified USADA’s sanctions against the American, the two bodies have been quick to hurl accusations and critiques at one another. UCI president Pat McQuaid conceded cycling was in crisis at a news conference on Monday, but he has since called into question USADA’s evidence and methods while raising grounds for a possible appeal by Armstrong. In a ‘Decision’ document posted on UCI’s website and signed by McQuaid, USADA’s report was said to have included “animated or overstated language” as well as “incorrect and incomplete statements”. “It would have been better that the evidence collected by USADA had been assessed by a neutral body or person who was not involved in collecting the evidence and prosecuting the defendant,” the document said. “This would have avoided both the criticism of (a) witch hunt against Mr Armstrong and the criticism that the UCI had a conflict of interest.” USADA chief executive Travis Tygart, who on Monday had called for a full and independent investigation into professional cycling, has since heaped further blame on UCI. “The truth is Lance Armstrong, on their watch, pulled off the greatest heist sport has ever seen,” Tygart said in an e-mail to the Guardian newspaper. “Instead of attempting to explain or justify their inadequacies, the UCI should acknowledge their responsibility and failures and find ways to make it right.” In response to UCI’s suggestion that USADA should have handed over its case file for an independent body to open disciplinary proceedings, Tygart said: “We set forth our position on why they were conflicted in this case on many different grounds. “They accepted money from him (Armstrong), they accused us of a witch-hunt (without seeing any evidence), they sued the chief whistleblower, they discouraged witnesses from participating. “They simply are trying to divert attention away from their own failures in this whole sad saga, and those that love the sport of cycling and clean sport should not allow that to happen.” Armstrong, 41, had previously elected not to contest USADA charges, prompting USADA to propose his punishment pending confirmation from cycling’s world governing body. Former Armstrong team mates at his U.S. Postal and Discovery Channel outfits, where he won his seven successive Tour titles from 1999 to 2005, testified against him and themselves and were given reduced bans by the American authorities. McQuaid, who has been widely criticized for his and the UCI’s handling of the Armstrong affair, was lambasted by World Anti-Doping Agency chief John Fahey earlier on Tuesday. “Looking back, clearly the doping was widespread,” Fahey told Fox Sports. “If that doping was widespread, then the question is legitimately put: who was stopping it? Who was working against it? Why wasn’t it stopped?” Fahey said the UCI had to “take the blinkers off” while asking a range of pertinent questions. “Look at the past, examine the people who are there, ask themselves the questions ‘Are those same people still in the sport and can they proceed forward with those people remaining?’ “I don’t think there’s any credibility if they don’t do that. I think they need to get confidence back into the sport so that its millions of supporters around the world will watch and support the sport going forward,” Fahey added. Tyler Hamilton, whose testimony helped bring down Armstrong, also blasted McQuaid, saying the Irishman had “no place” in the sport. McQuaid had described Hamilton and Floyd Landis, who also testified against Armstrong, as “scumbags” on Monday. “Pat McQuaid’s comments expose the hypocrisy of his leadership and demonstrate why he is incapable of any meaningful change,” Hamilton wrote in a statement on Tuesday. “Instead of seizing an opportunity to instil hope for the next generation of cyclists, he continues to point fingers, shift blame and attack those who speak out, tactics that are no longer effective. Pat McQuaid has no place in cycling.” Hamilton and Landis were among the 11 former Armstrong team mates to testify against him. Armstrong, widely accepted as one of the greatest cyclists of all time given he fought back from cancer to dominate the sport, has always denied doping and says he has never failed a doping test.

82,AMGN,WRAPUP-New class of cholesterol drugs shows promise in trials,"LOS ANGELES, Nov 5 (Reuters) - A new class of experimental cholesterol-lowering drugs demonstrated a promising new technique for reducing levels of the artery-clogging fatty deposits in mid-stage studies. The medicines, which are man-made antibodies, lowered “bad” cholesterol by more than 40 percent and up to 80 percent in small Phase 2 studies released by Amgen Inc and Pfizer Inc on Monday at the annual scientific meeting of the American Heart Association in Los Angeles. The drugs, given by injection every two or four weeks, are part of a group of biotech medicines known as PCSK9 inhibitors designed to target a protein that prevents the body from removing artery-blocking LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. The most commonly used cholesterol-lowering drugs - statins such as Pfizer’s Lipitor and AstraZeneca’s Crestor - work by preventing the liver from making cholesterol. The expiration of patents on all but one of that top-selling class of heart medicines - Crestor - has eroded one of the main sources of drug company profits. Mean annual sales of 15 different categories of heart drugs are set to fall by more than a quarter by 2017, from $83 billion in 2011 to $60 billion, according to consensus analyst forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters Pharma. Analysts have said the PCSK9 drugs could generate billions of dollars in annual sales. The experimental drugs from Pfizer and Amgen proved effective in lowering LDL cholesterol by significant amounts in patients genetically predisposed to high cholesterol and in patients unable to tolerate statins, according to the mid-stage data. The drugmakers aim, however, is to also show the new drugs can lower the risk of heart disease in a much broader group of patients who are not able to control their cholesterol with statins and other drugs, such as Merck and Co’s Zetia. Partners Regeneron Pharmaceuticals <REGN.O) and Sanofi  announced on Monday the launch of an 18,000-patient  trial of their once-every-two-weeks PCSK9 inhibitor to see if it cuts the risk of heart attacks, strokes and death, putting them ahead of the field pursuing the new class of drugs. Roche is also developing a PCSK9 drug. RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt estimated that there are roughly 1 million U.S. patients who are intolerant to statins and another 11 million whose cholesterol is poorly controlled by the drugs. In a Phase 2 trial, Amgen’s drug AMG145 showed it can reduce LDL levels by as much as 55 percent when combined with statins in patients genetically predisposed to high cholesterol. After 12 weeks, patients treated with a low dose of AMG145 had a 43 percent reduction in LDL, while those given a higher dose had a drop of 55 percent. Patients treated with a placebo saw a 1 percent increase in LDL cholesterol. A second Phase 2 trial of AMG145 found that it reduced LDL by up to 51 percent in patients unable to tolerate statins. When those patients were treated with AMG145 and ezetimibe - the chemical name for Zetia, LDL fell by 63 percent. The trial results were generally in line with expectations, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee. Amgen will present more AMG145 trial results on Tuesday, including a mid-stage trial in patients with uncontrolled cholesterol despite statins, which Yee said will be more interesting data. Sean Harper, head of research and development at Amgen, told Reuters in a telephone interview that the company plans to launch pivotal-stage trials of the drug early next year. He said the company will conduct a broader Phase 3 trial designed to see whether AMG145 can lower the risk of heart problems, and it was “not unreasonable” to assume that such a trial would take five years to yield results. Pfizer, which slightly lags Amgen and Regeneron in development of its experimental PCSK9 inhibitor, presented mid-stage trial data showing that its drug, RN316, also significantly lowers LDL cholesterol levels. In a 12-week trial of about 130 patients already on high doses statins, the Pfizer drug cut LDL cholesterol by 56 percent at the highest dose of 6 milligrams/kilogram of weight. The 3 mg/kg dose lowered LDL levels by 46 percent on top of statins, according to data unveiled on Monday. Barry Gumbiner, executive director of clinical research for Pfizer’s PCSK9 program, said the results were somewhat misleading because any patient whose LDL level fell below 25 had doses withheld as a precaution, skewing the overall results. After four weeks, patients on the highest dose had LDL reductions of up to 80 percent before some had doses withheld, Pfizer explained. The Pfizer drug was administered intravenously once every four weeks for a total of three dosings in the brief proof-of-concept trial.

83,AMGN,"U.S. top court reviews Comcast, Amgen class actions","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court considered appeals by Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) that could help determine what kind of evidence must be presented before companies may be the subject of class-action lawsuits. Monday’s complex arguments gave the court a new opportunity to further limit class actions, which can let large groups of plaintiffs seek larger recoveries at lower cost. Most recently, in June 2011 the court decertified a class of as many as 1.5 million Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) female workers who accused the world’s largest retailer of bias in pay and promotions, saying they raised too many different claims. In the Comcast case, subscribers led by Caroline Behrend had accused the largest U.S. cable TV company, which is also majority owner of NBC Universal, of overcharges that resulted from Comcast’s effort to monopolize the market in the Philadelphia area. The $875 million lawsuit was brought on behalf of a potential 2 million customers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware. Comcast said the subscribers were too different to sue as a class, but in August 2011 the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia said a trial judge could decide whether they had a common methodology to justify awarding damages to a class. Miguel Estrada, a lawyer arguing for Comcast, called the subscribers’ model for determining damages “bunk,” adding that the certified class covered subscribers in 649 franchise areas facing different competitive conditions. “If you drop a stone in the water, you’re going to have ripples all the way out,” he said. “That doesn’t mean all the ripples are the same.” Justice Anthony Kennedy appeared sympathetic to Comcast. “The judge has to make a determination that in his view the class can be certified,” he said. “And that includes some factual inquiries as to the damages alleged.” But the main issue, as framed by the justices ahead of oral arguments, had been whether the trial judge could rely on testimony from an expert witness for the subscribers before certifying a class. The subscribers’ lawyer Barry Barnett and some justices on Monday suggested that Philadelphia-based Comcast could not press that issue because it had not done so in the lower courts, and that perhaps the Supreme Court should not rule on the company’s appeal. “Usually we decide cases based on disagreements about law, and here I can’t find one,” Justice Elena Kagan said. Chief Justice John Roberts suggested differently. “One option for the court, since we did reformulate the question, is to answer the question,” and then ask a lower court to decide whether Comcast had waived its right to address it. In the Amgen case, shareholders accused the Thousand Oaks California-based biotechnology company of fraudulently inflating its stock price between April 2004 and May 2007 by exaggerating the safety of its anti-anemia drugs Aranesp and Epogen. Shareholders led by the Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds sought class certification based on the “fraud on the market” theory endorsed by the Supreme Court in a 1988 case. This assumes that the price of a stock in an efficient market reflects all public information, and that a purchaser is presumed to have relied on the truthfulness of that information. Amgen said the shareholders should have been forced at the class certification stage, rather than at trial, to prove that alleged misstatements materially inflated the company’s stock price. But last November, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena, California, let the class action proceed. Seth Waxman, a former U.S. solicitor general arguing for Amgen, told the court the shareholders cannot raise the fraud on the market theory without showing material misstatements. “Absent materiality, the market price cannot be presumed to reflect the statement in question,” he said. But Justice Antonin Scalia told the shareholders’ lawyer David Frederick there is “good reason” to decide the question of materiality before a class is certified. “The reason is the enormous pressure to settle once the class is certified,” he said. “In most cases, that’s the end of the lawsuit.” But Frederick noted that when Congress adopted a 1995 law to limit class-action lawsuits, it decided not to address the matter. “It’s not really for this court’s province to be imposing policy judgments about what additional requirements ought to be put on,” he said. “Congress made that judgment.” Comcast and Amgen were supported in their appeals by various business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, as well as former commissioners and officials at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Decisions are expected by the end of June 2013. The cases are Comcast Corp et al v. Behrend et al, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 11-864; and Amgen Inc et al v.

85,AMGN,Amgen drug cut cholesterol up to 66 percent in statin patients,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Amgen Inc’s experimental cholesterol-lowering drug, AMG145, reduced levels of “bad” cholesterol up to 66 percent in patients already taking statin drugs, according to results from a mid-stage trial that were presented on Tuesday. The findings were in line with other AMG145 studies showing significant reductions in LDL cholesterol that were unveiled this week at the American Heart Association scientific meeting in Los Angeles, California. The latest study of 629 patients is the largest trial so far of a drug in a new class of injectable biotech drugs, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, designed to target a protein that prevents the body from removing artery blocking LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. The Amgen trial findings were “as good as we could have hoped,” UBS analyst Matthew Roden said in a research note. The Phase 2 trial showed a mean reduction in LDL versus a placebo of 42 percent for patients injected with 70 mg of AMG145 every two weeks, 60 percent in the 105 mg group and 66 percent in the 140 mg group. When the drug was administered every two weeks, the mean reduction in LDL was 42 percent for the 280 mg group, 50 percent for the 350 mg group and 50 percent in the 420 mg group. “We had some patients with entry LDLs as low as 85,” said Dr. Robert Giugliano, associate professor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, and the study’s lead investigator, “At the end, some had LDLs measured in the teens.” Patients in the trial were taking common statin pills such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor. Some were taking Merck & Co Inc’s cholesterol medicine Zetia. Current guidelines from the AHA call for LDL levels to be 100, but some cardiologists believe even lower levels would be beneficial. Analysts have estimated that PCSK9 drugs - also being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in partnership with Sanofi, Pfizer, and Roche - could eventually generate billions Of dollars in annual sales. “Though trials vary, we currently assume safety and efficacy is likely similar across various drugs with Regeneron/Sanofi first to market,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt said in a research note. “In addition to clinical utility, market size is the next parameter up for debate.” He said the conservative estimate is that 15 percent of high-cholesterol patients need additional treatment, representing two million to three million patients, or an ultimate U.S. market opportunity of at least $10 billion to $15 billion. The most common side effects seen in the Amgen trial of statin patients were cold-like symptoms, cough and nausea. Side effects in previous, smaller, trials of the drug included injection-site reactions, headache and muscle pain. AMG145 has demonstrated “very effective lipid changes,” said Dr. Peter Wilson, an endocrinologist at Emory University and the Veterans’ Affairs Medical Center in Atlanta. He noted that more work needs to be done to determine the drug’s full impact on the liver and on muscles. Sean Harper, head of research and development at Amgen, said the company plans to begin pivotal-stage trials of AMG145 early next year. He said the company plans to first file for regulatory approval of AMG145 based on Phase III studies looking at the drug’s ability to lower LDL. Amgen also plans to conduct a broader Phase III trial designed to see whether AMG145 can lower the risk of heart problems. Harper said it was “not unreasonable” to assume that such a trial would take five years to yield results. “We have seen a very consistent effect of lowering LDL ... which is really important because by reducing LDL by half one would predict that we would be reducing the risk of cardiovascular events by about that same amount,” Harper said. Shares of Amgen, which have risen 37 percent so far this year, were up 88 cents at $87.23 in Nasdaq trading.

88,AMGN,Amgen buys Icelandic gene hunter Decode for $415 million,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. biotechnology group Amgen Inc has agreed to buy unlisted Decode Genetics, a pioneer in hunting down genes linked to disease, for $415 million in cash to boost its drive to develop better targeted drugs. Founded in 1996, Decode blazed a trail in personal genomics by trawling Iceland’s unique genetic heritage, which has changed little since the Vikings arrived more than 1,000 years ago, to work out the links between gene variants and common diseases. But it failed to live up to early expectations after going public in 2000 and filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009, weighed down by debts after 13 years of failing to make a profit, before re-emerging as a privately owned company. Amgen and Decode said on Monday that the transaction did not require regulatory approval and was expected to close before the end of 2012. As part of Amgen, Decode’s scientists will help in the task of ensuring that experimental medicines hit the right spot. Their know-how should allow Amgen to identify promising new avenues earlier and close down dead-ends more quickly. “This fits perfectly with our objective to pursue rapid development of relevant molecules that reach the right disease targets, while avoiding investments in programs based on less well-validated targets,” Amgen Chief Executive Robert Bradway said. UBS analysts said that the purchase, which will be funded by cash held offshore, was not surprising given that Amgen has key experimental drugs in its pipeline that were identified by human genetics work, including AMG 145 for heart disease and the bone drug romosozumab. Understanding the genetic basis of disease has become increasingly important in drug discovery as the pharmaceutical industry shifts to developing personalized medicine that is suited for a patient’s particular genetic profile. It is an area where Decode has extensive experience and its scientists have published prolifically on genetic mutations linked to a range of diseases including cancer, heart conditions and schizophrenia. Commercially, however, the Reykjavik-based company has been far less successful. Its drug development programs stalled and its DNA tests for diseases have not brought in much cash. The acquisition leaves Decode’s diagnostics business facing an uncertain future, with Amgen likely to evaluate this and other parts of the business after the deal closes. Decode is currently owned by Saga Investments, a consortium including Polaris Venture Partners and ARCH Venture Partners, which bought it out of bankruptcy in 2010. Polaris general partner Terry McGuire said his group had made a “substantial” return on its investment through the sale to Amgen, but he declined to give details or say if other large drug companies had been invited to bid for business. Decode went public on a wave of euphoria about genetics after U.S. President Bill Clinton announced the completion of a working-draft DNA sequence of the human genome in 2000. Turning that gene promise into new drugs has proved harder and more time-consuming than initially hoped. McGuire said that Decode’s founder and chief executive Kari Stefansson, a neurologist by training, would continue as president of the company after the Amgen takeover and would be a vice-president of research at the U.S. company. Other genomics companies have fallen by the wayside over the years, though one Human Genome Sciences has managed to develop the first new drug for lupus in half a century with its partner GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). GSK bought Human Genome Sciences for $3 billion this year, taking advantage of a dip in the U.S. biotech company’s shares. Two people familiar with the situation said in July that Amgen had also offered to buy the business for twice as much in 2010.

91,AMGN,"Amgen to pay $762 million, pleads guilty in marketing case","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amgen Inc pleaded guilty in a New York federal court on Tuesday for improper marketing practices involving its once top-selling Aranesp anemia drug, and prosecutors said the company has agreed to pay $762 million in a civil settlement and criminal fines. The world’s largest biotechnology company had set aside funds it expected to have to pay as a result of federal and state investigations, as well as nearly a dozen civil whistleblower lawsuits. Federal prosecutors said in court that the company had agreed to pay $612 million in a civil settlement, a $14 million criminal forfeiture payment, and a $136 million criminal fine. Amgen entered the guilty plea to one misdemeanor count. Acting U.S. attorney Marshall Miller confirmed that under the agreement Amgen will not lose any federal business or contracts. Exclusion from federal programs, such as Medicare, could have crippled its business. As part of the deal, Amgen will enter into a five-year corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, prosecutors said. The agreement will require Amgen’s executives and members of its board of directors to certify compliance with applicable regulations, institute new transparency measures and put corporate officers “on the hook” for compliance failures within that five-year period, prosecutors said. The plea agreement must be approved by U.S. District Judge Sterling Johnson. He has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday morning. Aranesp, primarily used to treat anemia in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, remains one of Amgen’s largest drugs with sales of $2.3 billion in 2011. Its sales, and that of a related older red blood cell booster Epogen, have declined significantly over the past few years amid safety concerns, stricter usage guidelines and reimbursement restrictions. Amgen was accused of promoting Aranesp for anemia caused by cancer, for which it was not approved, rather than to combat anemia as a side effect of chemotherapy treatments. The company was also accused of pushing higher doses and more convenient treatment schedules than what was approved in the drug’s label for both cancer and chronic kidney disease patients. The government said the illegal practices were undertaken in part to help Amgen take market share from Johnson & Johnson’s similar anemia drug Procrit. Amgen was “pursuing profits at the risk of patients’ safety,” Miller told reporters Tuesday after the plea hearing. He added that while the company “circumvented the FDA approval process,” the investigation had not uncovered any evidence of fraudulent intent on Amgen’s part. Federal prosecutors declined to comment further on the civil portion of the settlement, which they said is still under seal. A spokeswoman for the company, based in Thousand Oaks, California, said that if the judge accepts the criminal plea tomorrow, “Amgen expects immediately thereafter to complete the comprehensive resolution of related civil and criminal matters,” for which it had previously recorded a $780 million charge in the third quarter of 2011. In a recent regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Amgen said it had accrued $806 million related to the proposed settlement of charges arising out of the federal civil and criminal investigations.

Amgen entered the guilty plea, but no sentence has been issued. Aranesp is one of Amgen’s largest drugs and had sales of $2.3 billion in 2011. A spokeswoman for the company, based in Thousand Oaks, California, declined to give an immediate comment.

95,AMGN,Amgen to plead guilty in criminal case: prosecutors,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Biotech company Amgen Inc is scheduled to plead guilty on Tuesday in a criminal case in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, prosecutors said. A brief statement from the U.S. Attorney’s office gave no details of the charges Amgen would plead guilty to. Representatives of Amgen could not immediately be reached to comment on the subject matter of the expected plea. Amgen in October 2011 said it had taken a $780 million charge to settle a probe into allegedly illegal sales and marketing practices. The investigation, relating to sales of its anemia drugs Aranesp and Epogen, had been conducted for several years by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and Seattle. Amgen said at the time that if settlement discussions were successful, the $780 million would resolve federal probes and related state Medicaid claims as well as other litigation. But the company did not disclose when and if it would plead guilty to criminal charges. The biotechnology company disclosed in court papers filed in 2010 that it has been under investigation by the Brooklyn federal prosecutor since 2006 in connection with alleged violations of the False Claims Act and other federal statutes.

96,AMGN,Court approves Amgen's $762 million payment in drug case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday approved a $762 million payment from Amgen Inc, the final step to resolve nearly a dozen criminal and civil cases stemming from the sale of its once-blockbuster anemia drug Aranesp and several others. Prosecutors previously said in Brooklyn federal court on Tuesday the company had agreed to pay $612 million in a civil settlement, a $14 million criminal forfeiture payment, and a $136 million criminal fine. It is the single largest criminal and civil fraud settlement involving a biotechnology company in U.S. history, according to the U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn. Amgen pleaded guilty on Tuesday to one misdemeanor criminal count that it promoted Aranesp for higher, less frequent doses than approved in the drug’s label by federal regulators. The company was also accused of marketing the drug to treat anemia caused by cancer, for which it was not approved, rather than to combat anemia as a side effect of chemotherapy treatments. Amgen recorded a $780 million charge in the third quarter of 2011 to resolve civil and criminal litigation. In a recent regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Amgen said it had set aside $806 million related to the proposed settlement of charges arising out of the federal civil and criminal investigations. U.S. District Judge Sterling Johnson accepted the company’s plea on Wednesday and approved its plea agreement with the government. The agreement includes a call for Amgen to abide by a five-year corporate integrity agreement, which imposes new compliance, transparency and accountability measures on the company’s top executives and directors. The agreement resolves a more than five-year investigation by the U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn, as well as a related investigation by federal prosecutors in Washington state, according to court papers. “Instead of working to extend and enhance human lives, Amgen illegally pursued corporate profits while jeopardizing the safety of vulnerable consumers suffering from disease,” acting U.S. attorney Marshall Miller of the Eastern District of New York said in a statement. Details of the $612 million civil portion of the settlement were also unsealed Wednesday, encompassing a wider scope of allegations than the criminal case. The civil settlement resolves 10 whistleblower lawsuits from Brooklyn, Massachusetts and Washington federal courts, prosecutors said. The civil settlement covers allegations that Amgen market Aranesp and two other drugs, Enbrel and Neulasta, for uses and doses that had not been approved. The company was also accused of offering illegal kickbacks to try to persuade health-care providers to prescribe their drugs, and engaged in false price reporting practices, federal prosecutors said. Other Amgen drugs named in the civil suits include Epogen, Neupogen and Sensipar, according to court papers. “The government raised important concerns in the criminal prosecution,” Amgen chief compliance officer Cynthia Patton said in a statement. “Amgen acknowledges that mistakes were made, and we did not live up to our standards.” Amgen shares were down 53 cents to $88.76 in midafternoon trading.

The company, now expects full-year adjusted earnings of between $6.40 and $6.50 a share, Chief Executive Robert Bradway said here during a presentation at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference. The tax credit was extended beginning this year, he noted. Amgen will report 2012 results on Jan. 23. Bradway, who took the helm of Amgen, said he feels good about momentum going into 2013, and said the company will outline its strategy at a Feb. 7 meeting investor meeting in New York. Share repurchases and dividend increases helped Amgen produce a total return to shareholders of 36 percent last year, but the buybacks will taper off and the company expects a net cash position this year, Bradway said. “Buybacks will moderate as we shift the focus to dividends,”  he said. He anticipates continued sales growth in Amgen’s franchise drugs as well as new products from its development pipeline. BIND Biosciences announced on Tuesday that Amgen agreed to invest up to $180.5 million to help develop a cancer drug based on BIND’s nanomedicine platform, starting with an upfront payment of $46.5 million. Amgen, which acquired Turkish pharmaceutical company Mustafa Nevzat last year, will also continue to expand internationally, Bradway said. “We don’t yet have a presence in Japan, so Japan is clearly a focus,” he said, adding that Amgen plans to enter that market in an “effective, clever way.” He also expressed interest in broadening Amgen’s investment in China, Brazil, Mexico and other nations with a growing middle class. Shares of Amgen were down $1.03, or 1.2 percent, at $87.50 on Nasdaq.

102,AMGN,Amgen 2013 revenue forecast tops Street estimates,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) on Wednesday projected revenue for 2013 that exceeds Wall Street estimates and said it was on track to deliver on its 2015 forecasts well ahead of schedule. The world’s largest biotechnology company forecast 2013 revenue of $17.8 billion to $18.2 billion and adjusted earnings of $6.85 to $7.15 per share. Analysts on average are looking for revenue of $17.7 billion and earnings of $6.99 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The 2013 forecast suggests “that they expect good momentum from 2012,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said. “They have a history of guiding conservatively and then beating.” The company was true to that history on a call with analysts and investors. Amgen previously targeted 2015 revenue of $16 billion to $18 billion and adjusted earnings of $7.25 to $8.60 per share. On Wednesday, Amgen management said it was on track to hit the upper end of its 2015 revenue guidance two years early and the EPS forecast at least one year early. It said it is on track to earn at least $8 per share for 2015. Amgen, whose shares gained 34 percent last year, noted that its deferred 2012 research and development (R&D;) tax credit, which the U.S. Congress failed to address in time for 2012, would be recorded in the first quarter of 2013. The company also intends to continue to return cash to investors through meaningful increases to its dividend going forward. Net profit for the fourth quarter fell as sales of some key products declined and R&D; spending and other costs jumped. Excluding items, Amgen had adjusted earnings of $1.40 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 2 cents. Net profit fell to $788 million, or $1.01 per share, from $934 million, or $1.08 per share, a year ago. Revenue for the quarter rose 11 percent to $4.42 billion, edging past Wall Street estimates of $4.37 billion. But R&D; spending rose 9 percent due to large clinical trials of two experimental drugs, including for a promising cholesterol fighter from a new class of medicines called PCSK9 inhibitors that is just beginning expensive late stage testing. Selling, general and administrative costs rose 13 percent for the quarter. Sales of Enbrel for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis jumped 23 percent to $1.16 billion with the help of price increases. That topped analyst estimates of $1.08 billion. But sales of other important products declined and fell short of expectations, including combined worldwide sales of white blood cell boosters Neupogen and Neulasta, which fell 1 percent to $1.3 billion. Sales of anemia drugs Aranesp and Epogen, which have been declining in recent years because of safety concerns and usage restrictions continued to slide, but at a slower pace. Aranesp sales fell 9 percent to $489 million, while the older red blood cell booster, Epogen, fell just 1 percent to $479 million, both missing analysts’ expectations of about $505 million and $480 million, respectively. Sales of newer drug Xgeva to prevent fractures due to cancer that has spread to the bones rose to $215 million from $201 million in the prior quarter, but fell short of Wall Street estimates of about $222 million. The related osteoporosis drug, Prolia, exceeded expectations of about $137 million with fourth quarter sales of $154 million. “Enbrel and Prolia were the only major line-items that appeared to beat,” Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with ISI Group, said in a research note. “Neupogen/Neulasta missed by a bit, and this needs to be monitored as Amgen prepares for more U.S. competition from Teva (TEVA.TA) in late 2013,” Schoenebaum said. Amgen shares slipped to $82.60 in after hours trading from their Nasdaq close at $83.07.

105,AMGN,Amgen biosimilar push takes aim at blockbusters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amgen Inc said it expects generic versions of biotech drugs, known as biosimilars, to be a multibillion-dollar opportunity for the company and has targeted some of the industry’s biggest sellers, including the main rivals for its own blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel. The company on Thursday also said that between this year and 2016 it will have key late-stage data from eight experimental medicines. Amgen Chief Executive Robert Bradway, at a meeting in New York to update analysts and investors on business strategy, said the company plans to launch six biosimilars beginning in 2017 - four cancer drugs and the two Enbrel rivals - Abbvie’s Humira and Remicade, which is sold by Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Co Inc. It also plans to launch biosimilar versions of Roche Holding AG’s multibillion-dollar cancer drugs Avastin, Herceptin and Rituxan, as well as Eli Lilly and Co’s Erbitux. “They went after six of the largest biologics in the market with a total of over $40 billion in revenue. But they laid out this big goal without a lot of specifics,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee, who is looking for details on pricing and the types of studies the company will conduct to bring its biosimilars to market. “Certainly biosimilars are an important driver to 2017 and beyond, but we’d like more specifics.” The world’s largest biotechnology company believes it has a unique capability to become a major player in biosimilars once U.S. health regulators finalize the approval pathway for such drugs, which are not identical matches of the branded medicines in the manner of traditional generic versions of pills. “The company is clearly straddling two business opportunities that sometimes seem in conflict with each other - a defender of the innovative products and a participant in biosimilar products. That tension is going to continue to be difficult for them to manage,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges. Amgen research chief Sean Harper said the company was viewing biosimilars as more of a global opportunity. “We feel that these medicines are very valuable and in many parts of the world patients have no access to them because they are so expensive,” he said. Enbrel, which had 2012 sales of $4.2 billion and has patent protection into 2028, will become more profitable at the end of the year, when a profit-sharing arrangement with Pfizer becomes a royalty payment. That will result in an operating profit of about $800 million in 2014, the company said. Amgen raised its 2013 earnings forecast to account for a tax credit due to federal settlements for prior years. Amgen now expects adjusted 2013 earnings of $7.05 to $7.35 per share, and said it would record the credit in the first quarter. The company last month forecast earnings per share of $6.85 to $7.15. The 2013 revenue forecast remains unchanged at $17.8 billion to $18.2 billion. Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Peacock said Amgen will continue to return more than 60 percent of adjusted net profit to shareholders through dividend increases and some share buybacks. The company also said it plans to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions, and that it expects to expand its business into major Asian markets in 2015 and 2016. “The fact that Amgen was not present in Japan and China was a noticeable gap,” Bradway said. “They are a bellwether for the industry,” Bernstein’s Porges said of Amgen. “The real focus is getting into lower-priced markets and lower-priced products and driving business through cost efficiencies. That tells you something about the state of the industry.” Harper provided an update of the company’s drugs in development in several therapeutic areas, including medicines for a variety of cancers, heart disease, osteoporosis and psoriasis. The cancer drugs include trebananib for ovarian cancer with key late-stage data expected in mid-2013, and rilotumumab for advanced gastric cancer, a huge unmet need in China and emerging markets. Late-stage data on that drug is due in 2016, just about the time the company sees making a move into China. Amgen’s highest-profile drug in development is AMG-145, its cholesterol fighter from a closely watched new class of medicines called PCSK9 inhibitors meant to be taken by patients unable to tolerate statins, like Lipitor and Zocor, or those who fail to reach LDL goals with statins. In earlier clinical trials, PCSK9 inhibitors have dramatically reduced bad LDL cholesterol. The class, which blocks a protein that prevents the body from removing artery-clogging LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream, is a hot area of research being pursued by several companies, including Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc in partnership with Sanofi SA, and Pfizer. Amgen has begun a Phase III AMG-145 program with more than 26,000 patients over seven studies. It expects to have initial Phase III data in early 2014, and estimates having results in 2018 from a large so-called outcomes study to demonstrate that it can reduce heart attacks and strokes. Harper said he was confident that AMG-145 would show “a decrease in cardiovascular outcomes”. He added: “This will be the biggest study Amgen has ever done.” He expressed similar confidence that romosozumab for post-menopausal osteoporosis would prevent fractures in a pair of late-stage trials of about 6,000 women, with data expected in 2015. Tony Hooper, Amgen’s head of global commercial operations, said AMG-145 would compete in a market estimated to be 17 million high-risk patients. Amgen shares were off 96 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $85.63 on Nasdaq, on a generally down day for the broader market.

Research chief Sean Harper provided an update of the company’s drugs in development in several therapeutic categories, including medicines for a variety of cancers, heart disease, osteoporosis and psoriasis. The cancer drugs include trebananib for ovarian cancer with key late-stage data expected in mid-2013, and rilotumumab for advanced gastric cancer, a huge unmet need in China and emerging markets. Late stage data on that drug is due in 2016, just about the time the company sees making a move into China. Amgen’s highest-profile drug in development is AMG-145, its cholesterol fighter from a closely watched new class of medicines called PCSK9 inhibitors meant to be taken by patients unable to tolerate statins, like Lipitor and Zocor, or those who fail to reach LDL goals with statins. In earlier clinical trials, PCSK9 inhibitors have dramatically reduced bad LDL cholesterol. The class, which blocks a protein that prevents the body from removing artery-clogging LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream, is a hot area of research being pursued by several companies, including Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN.O) in partnership with Sanofi SA (SASY.PA), and Pfizer. Amgen has begun a Phase III AMG-145 program with more than 26,000 patients over seven studies. It expects to have initial Phase III data in early 2014, and estimates having results in 2018 from a large so-called outcomes study to demonstrate that it can reduce heart attacks and strokes. Harper said he was confident that AMG-145 would show “a decrease in cardiovascular outcomes.” He added: “This will be the biggest study Amgen has ever done.” He expressed similar confidence that romosozumab for post-menopausal osteoporosis would prevent fractures in a pair of late stage trials of about 6,000 women, with data expected in 2015. Tony Hooper, Amgen’s head of global commercial operations, said AMG-145 would compete in a market estimated to be about 17 million high-risk patients. Amgen shares were down 0.7 percent at $85.98 on Thursday morning on the Nasdaq.

108,AMGN,"Amgen outlines pipeline, sees push into biosimilars","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) said on Thursday that between this year and 2016 it will have key late-stage data from eight experimental medicines, and that it expects generic versions of biotech drugs, known as biosimilars, to be a multi-billion dollar opportunity for the company. Amgen Chief Executive Robert Bradway, at a meeting in New York with analysts and investors to provide an update to its business strategy, said the company plans to launch six biosimilars beginning in 2017 - four cancer drugs and two for inflammatory diseases. The world’s largest biotechnology company believes it has a unique capability to become a major player in biosimilars once U.S. health regulators finalize the approval pathway for such drugs, which are not identical matches of the branded medicines the way traditional generic versions of pills are. Amgen also raised its 2013 earnings forecast to account for a tax credit due to federal settlements for prior years. Amgen said that it now expects adjusted 2013 earnings of $7.05 per share to $7.35 per share, and that it would record the credit in the first quarter. The company last month had forecast earnings per share of $6.85 to $7.15. The 2013 revenue forecast remains unchanged at $17.8 billion to $18.2 billion. The company said it plans to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions, and that it expects to expand its business into Japan and China after 2016. “We think this has the potential for a meaningful contribution to the business,” Bradway said of long-term Asian expansion plans.

Election projections showed the center-right coalition led by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi was leading in the race for the Italian Senate, contradicting initial exit polls and raising the specter of deadlock in parliament. Earlier polls pointing to a center-left victory lifted stocks in Milan and other European markets on investors’ belief that they would continue the path to pay down Italian debt, said Art Hogan, managing director of Lazard Capital Markets in New York. “What we don’t want to hear is a renewed fear about a euro- zone fracture,” he said. Last week, the benchmark S&P; 500 closed below its 14-day moving average on Wednesday for the first time this year. At midday, the S&P; 500 was trading just below that level, now near 1,515. The index was, nonetheless, still near highs not seen in five years, as bets on a strong U.S. economy have given equities support. The S&P; 500’s slight fall last week was the first weekly drop after a seven-week string of gains. Banks and other financial stocks led Monday’s decline on concern about the sector’s exposure to Italy’s massive debt. The KBW Bank Index fell 0.7 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 18.58 points or 0.13 percent, to 13,981.99. The Standard & Poor’s 500  shed 2.30 points or 0.15 percent, to 1,513.30. But the Nasdaq Composite rose 3.03 points or 0.10 percent, to 3,164.85. Barnes & Noble Inc shares climbed 11.9 percent to $15.12 after the bookseller’s chairman offered to buy its declining retail business. The Nasdaq received support from Amgen Inc, up 4.2 percent at $90.47, after a rival issued a voluntary recall of its only drug, an anemia treatment that competes with Amgen’s top-selling red blood cell booster, Epogen. The FTSEurofirst-300 index of top European shares  unofficially closed up 0.1 percent and Italy’s main FTSE MIB  ended up 0.7 percent after earlier gaining near 4 percent.

113,AMGN,"FDA halts trials of Amgen drug in children, cites death","(Reuters) - The Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday it has stopped all pediatric clinical trials of Amgen Inc’s Sensipar after the death of a 14-year-old patient taking part in a study of the drug. Sensipar, which is approved for adults, is used to lower dangerously high calcium levels in the blood. The agency said it was collecting information on the circumstances of the teenager’s death. It said it does not know if the Amgen drug had any role in the death. “This communication is intended to inform health care professionals that we are evaluating the information and will communicate our final conclusions and recommendations when our review is complete,” the FDA said in a statement posted on its website.

Sensipar works by decreasing the release of parathyroid hormone from the parathyroid gland to lower calcium levels in the blood. High levels of calcium in the blood can lead to serious health problems. Sensipar, which had worldwide sales of $950 million in 2012, is approved to treat adults 18 and over.

116,AMGN,Amgen loses as top U.S. court backs class actions,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court made it easier on Wednesday for shareholders to bring class-action lawsuits, breaking a recent line of decisions that had made it harder to sue corporate defendants collectively and perhaps obtain greater recoveries. By a 6-3 vote, the court allowed shareholders of Amgen Inc to sue the biotechnology company as a group without first having to show that misinformation had materially and fraudulently inflated its stock price. Shareholders, led by the Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, had accused the Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen of misleading them between April 2004 and May 2007 by exaggerating the safety of its anti-anemia drugs, Aranesp and Epogen. Writing for the majority, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said early stages of class-action litigation are meant simply to ensure that cases are litigated fairly and efficiently. Amgen “would have us put the cart before the horse,” she wrote. “Congress, we count it significant, has addressed the settlement pressures associated with securities-fraud class actions through means other than requiring proof of mate­riality at the class-certification stage.” David Frederick, a lawyer for Amgen shareholders, said: “We’re very pleased by the court’s decision. It’s a good day for investors.” Amgen spokeswoman Ashleigh Koss said the company expects the case to return to U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez in Los Angeles for further proceedings, and “will vigorously defend itself” when it does. Wednesday’s decision upheld a November 2011 ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena, California, that allowed the class action to proceed. Lower courts had been divided on the central issue. “This is a big win for shareholder plaintiffs,” said Jill Fisch, a securities law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. “It doesn’t just say you don’t have to prove materiality, but the majority slaps down the policy argument that there is too much securities fraud litigation. It says Congress already took care of that.” Some business groups supported Amgen’s appeal. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the 9th Circuit decision encouraged premature class certifications that could pressure corporate defendants to settle even “frivolous” cases. Several former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission commissioners agreed, saying that securities fraud cases almost always are settled after classes are certified, and that an Amgen loss would “compel settlement of even questionable claims.” Shareholders had sought class certification against the “fraud on the market” theory endorsed by the Supreme Court in a 1988 case, Basic Inc v. Levinson. This assumes that the price of a stock in an efficient market reflects all public information, and that a purchaser is presumed to have relied on the verity of that information. Fisch said securities fraud cases could be costly to litigate virtually at the outset because of the need to show a strong inference of fraudulent intent and losses. “This opinion doesn’t change that, but also doesn’t require an extra complication - effectively a mini-trial - on materiality,” she said. The decision included an unusual voting lineup. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, along with the more liberal justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, signed on to Ginsburg’s opinion. Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas dissented. Scalia accused the majority of making it too easy to pursue class actions, expanding the consequences of Basic “from the arguably regrettable to the unquestionably disastrous.” Shares of Amgen rose $1.39, or 1.6 percent, to $90.86 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. Wednesday’s decision also breaks a recent trend by the court to narrow class-action litigation. The April 2011 decision in AT&T; Mobility v. Concepcion upheld contracts that required customers to arbitrate disputes individually, and waived their right to pursue class actions. Two months later, the court decertified a class action of as many as 1.5 million Wal-Mart Stores Inc female workers who accused the world’s largest retailer of bias in pay and promotions, saying they raised too many different claims. But Wednesday’s decision “suggests that the court is not going to simply be a lackey of well-capitalized defendants, and make it more difficult than as explicitly required by law for shareholders to recover for economic loss,” said Heidi Li Feldman, a professor at Georgetown Law School. “The class action,” she said, “is a perfect tool to prevent someone whose securities trade in a large, impersonal market from committing fraud on everyone else.” On March 25, the Supreme Court will take up class actions again when it hears arguments on whether doctors may arbitrate a dispute over payments with Oxford Health Plans LLC collectively, though the governing agreement did not mention class actions. Meanwhile, on the same day the Amgen case was argued, the court heard arguments involving cable TV company Comcast Corp over what evidence must be presented before companies can be sued in class actions.

119,AMGN,"Merck veteran named R&D; chief, after drug setbacks","(Reuters) - Merck & Co will bring back one of its veterans to head research and development, replacing retiring Peter Kim, who leaves behind a mixed record over the past decade at the drugmaker’s highly respected laboratories. Merck, after recent setbacks for some of its most important experimental drugs, said former Amgen Inc research chief Roger Perlmutter will take over from Kim on April 15, although Kim, 55, will stay on as a company advisor until August. “This is an acknowledgement by Merck that the status quo wasn’t getting desired results,” said analyst Barbara Ryan of Barbara Ryan Advisors. The appointment represents a homecoming for Perlmutter, 60, who joined Amgen in February 2001 after four years with Merck, where he oversaw global basic research and preclinical development. While at Amgen sales of its Epogen and Aranesp anemia drugs plunged due to safety concerns. But Perlmutter helped Amgen, the world’s biggest biotechnology company, branch out into new areas — including successful development of Prolia for osteoporosis and Sensipar, used to treat dangerously high calcium levels in the blood. It is testing treatments for cancer, cholesterol, psoriasis and a promising new type of osteoporosis drug. Most of the Amgen drugs are biologics, meaning they are injectable products made in living cells and involve a costly manufacturing process. But biotech drugs command far higher prices than conventional pills, making them an increasing focus for drugmakers. “Merck may become more aggressive now in acquiring and developing more biotech drugs,” with Perlmutter as research chief, Ryan predicted. Perlmutter became Amgen’s research chief only months after Kim, then a 42-year-old professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was selected to head research at Merck. Merck has had several big successes under Kim’s watch, including development of its blockbuster Januvia diabetes medicine, its Gardasil vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, its Zostavax shingles vaccine and its Isentress treatment for HIV. But more recently, it has been hurt by failed trials of cholesterol treatment Tredaptive and migraine drug telcagepant, and a regulatory delay for a new type of osteoporosis medicine called odanacatib. Merck’s Vioxx arthritis drug was recalled in 2004 after being linked to heart attacks and strokes, forcing Kim to defend controversial clinical trials of the pill that were conducted before his arrival. New medicines are badly needed at Merck, where sales of its onetime $6 billion-a-year Singulair asthma drug are plunging due to generic competition and other medicines will soon face cheaper generics. Moreover, cost savings from Merck’s 2009 purchase of rival Schering Plough have mostly dried up and are no longer able to boost company earnings. “On balance, most investors we speak with have been disappointed by Peter Kim’s tenure as head of Merck’s R&D;,” Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note on Thursday. “We believe a transition makes sense at this time.” Fernandez said he believed Perlmutter’s 10-year tenure at Amgen were “constructive.

120,AMGN,"UPDATE 1-Merck veteran named R&D; chief, after drug setbacks","By Ransdell Pierson March 7 (Reuters) - Merck & Co will bring back one of its veterans to head research and development, replacing retiring Peter Kim, who leaves behind a mixed record over the past decade at the drugmaker’s highly respected laboratories. Merck, after recent setbacks for some of its most important experimental drugs, said former Amgen Inc research chief Roger Perlmutter will take over from Kim on April 15, although Kim, 55, will stay on as a company advisor until August. “This is an acknowledgement by Merck that the status quo wasn’t getting desired results,” said analyst Barbara Ryan of Barbara Ryan Advisors. The appointment represents a homecoming for Perlmutter, 60, who joined Amgen in February 2001 after four years with Merck, where he oversaw global basic research and preclinical development. While at Amgen sales of its Epogen and Aranesp anemia drugs plunged due to safety concerns. But Perlmutter helped Amgen, the world’s biggest biotechnology company, branch out into new areas — including successful development of Prolia for osteoporosis and Sensipar, used to treat dangerously high calcium levels in the blood. It is testing treatments for cancer, cholesterol, psoriasis and a promising new type of osteoporosis drug. Most of the Amgen drugs are biologics, meaning they are injectable products made in living cells and involve a costly manufacturing process. But biotech drugs command far higher prices than conventional pills, making them an increasing focus for drugmakers. “Merck may become more aggressive now in acquiring and developing more biotech drugs,” with Perlmutter as research chief, Ryan predicted. Perlmutter became Amgen’s research chief only months after Kim, then a 42-year-old professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was selected to head research at Merck. Merck has had several big successes under Kim’s watch, including development of its blockbuster Januvia diabetes medicine, its Gardasil vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, its Zostavax shingles vaccine and its Isentress treatment for HIV. But more recently, it has been hurt by failed trials of cholesterol treatment Tredaptive and migraine drug telcagepant, and a regulatory delay for a new type of osteoporosis medicine called odanacatib. Merck’s Vioxx arthritis drug was recalled in 2004 after being linked to heart attacks and strokes, forcing Kim to defend controversial clinical trials of the pill that were conducted before his arrival. New medicines are badly needed at Merck, where sales of its onetime $6 billion-a-year Singulair asthma drug are plunging due to generic competition and other medicines will soon face cheaper generics. Moreover, cost savings from Merck’s 2009 purchase of rival Schering Plough have mostly dried up and are no longer able to boost company earnings. “On balance, most investors we speak with have been disappointed by Peter Kim’s tenure as head of Merck’s R&D;,” Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note on Thursday. “We believe a transition makes sense at this time.” Fernandez said he believed Perlmutter’s 10-year tenure at Amgen were “constructive. Overall he strikes us as a thoughtful straight shooter and a decisive leader.” Merck praised Kim’s tenure. “His contributions have positioned us well for future success.” Shares of Merck were down nearly 1 percent in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.",3072013,http://www.reuters.com/article/merck-perlmutter/update-1-merck-veteran-named-rd-chief-after-drug-setbacks-idUSL1N0BZE8N20130307

122,AMGN,Amgen's melanoma drug shows promise in key trial,"March 19 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc said its experimental and novel treatment for advanced melanoma met the main goal of a late-stage clinical trial by demonstrating a durable response in significantly more patients than a comparison treatment. The drug known as talimogene laherparepvec induced a durable response rate (DRR) - defined as a complete or partial tumor shrinkage lasting for at least six months - in 16 percent of patients, according to preliminary results. While that is a relatively small percentage, that was considered to be statistically significant compared with a DRR of just 2 percent for the comparison treatment, subcutaneous granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), in the difficult to treat disease. Melanoma is the deadliest of skin cancers, accounting for some 75 percent of all skin cancer deaths. The company did not yet have data on overall survival from the 400-patient study, but said interim analysis showed a trend toward an overall survival benefit favoring the Amgen drug. Talimogene laherparepvec, which is injected directly into the tumor, has a unique dual mechanism of action. It is designed to replicate inside the tumor until membranes of the cancer cells rupture, destroying them. The drug then activates a systemic immune response to kill tumor cells throughout the body. Amgen said it will release more detailed data from the study at a major medical meeting later this year.",3192013,http://www.reuters.com/article/amgen-melanoma/amgens-melanoma-drug-shows-promise-in-key-trial-idUSL1N0CBH1L20130319

124,AMGN,Amgen to pay $25 million to settle kickback allegations,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc has agreed to pay $24.9 million to settle allegations that it provided kickbacks to long-term care pharmacy providers to entice them to use its Aranesp anemia drug instead of a rival medicine, the Department of Justice announced on Tuesday. The DOJ charged that the world’s largest biotechnology company violated the False Claims Act through kickbacks paid to Omnicare Inc, Kindred Healthcare Inc and PharMerica Corp in exchange for switching Medicare and Medicaid patients to Aranesp to treat their anemia. “We will continue to pursue pharmaceutical companies that pay kickbacks to long-term care pharmacy providers to influence drug-prescribing decisions,” Stuart Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Civil Division, said in a statement. “Patients in skilled nursing facilities deserve care that is free of improper financial influences,” he added. The civil settlement resolves a lawsuit filed in District Court for the District of South Carolina under the whistleblower provision of the False Claims Act, the DOJ said. The lawsuit was the fourth of five qui tam, or whistleblower, suits brought against the company that had been previously disclosed by Amgen. One had been previously settled and two others dismissed, the company said. In a statement, Amgen denied all of the allegations that were resolved by the settlement.

126,AMGN,"Diabetes, bone, pain drugs may face German price cuts","FRANKFURT, April 18 (Reuters) - Drugs from Novo Nordisk , Amgen, Bayer and other companies could face price cuts in Germany as the country’s medical cost-benefit agency widens a review into the value offered by medicines. The Federal Joint Committee, or G-BA, said on Thursday it would review the cost-effectiveness of a range of drugs in different treatment areas. The list includes Novo’s diabetes drug Victoza, Bayer’s blood-thinner Xarelto, Amgen’s osteoporosis medicine Prolia, Johnson & Johnson’s painkiller Nucynta and Roche’s  rheumatoid arthritis drug Actemra. Other drugs in the same therapeutic class will also be covered by the review. The G-BA, which will look at the affected drugs one at a time over the coming months, picked these products because they are among the biggest-selling in Germany, based both on revenues and volume sales. Germany introduced a new system in January 2011 under which newly launched drugs are only allowed free pricing for one year, after which prices are negotiated based on a cost-benefit analysis. The latest initiative by the G-BA extends this system to certain medicines already on the market. Countries across Europe are taking a harder line in demanding that drugmakers show that the price of their products is commensurate with their clinical value. Britain’s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, or NICE, has carried out such cost-effectiveness reviews for more than a decade.",4182013,http://www.reuters.com/article/germany-medicines/diabetes-bone-pain-drugs-may-face-german-price-cuts-idUSL5N0D548520130418
127,AMGN,Fitch Affirms Amgen's IDR at 'BBB'; Ratings Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Amgen Inc.'s (Amgen)  ratings, including the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook  is Stable. A full list of ratings affirmed is listed below.  The ratings apply to approximately $26.6 billion of debt at Dec. 31, 2012. KEY RATING DRIVERS Amgen's gross debt leverage is currently high relative to its 'BBB' IDR. There  is limited flexibility in the rating for any increase in debt leverage, whether  driven by weak operating performance or debt funding of acquisitions or  shareholder returns. However, Fitch notes that given Amgen's consistent and  strong free cash flow (FCF) generation and large cash balances, the company has  ample liquidity to fund its financial policy without increasing debt levels,  limiting the potential for negative rating action in the near term. Leverage improvement from EBITDA jump: Debt leverage will improve from a boost in EBITDA resulting from the phased  dissolution of the Enbrel co-promotion agreement with Pfizer starting in  November 2013. As such, Fitch estimates that adjusted debt leverage and total  debt leverage may each drop below 3.0x in 2014 excluding a decrease in the debt  load. At the end of 2012, adjusted debt leverage and gross debt leverage were  3.7x and 3.6x, respectively, and 3.4x and 3.3x (excluding prefunding 2013 debt).  Strong FCF despite operational pressures: Fitch anticipates steady, strong FCF despite increasing dividends. Cash flow  generation has been resilient to operational stresses which have included key  drug patent losses outside the U.S., expanded brand name competition to Enbrel,  reimbursement and demand pressures on the once top-selling ESA franchises, and  higher interest payments from incremental debt used for its capital plan. The company has maintained FCF generation greater than $4 billion annually since  2005, and in 2012, FCF was $4.1 billion representing a margin of 23.6%.  Additional liquidity comes from $2.5 billion of unused revolver capacity and  $24.1 billion of cash and marketable securities at the end of 2012. Amgen has  debt maturities totaling $2 billion in 2014 consisting of $1 billion in 1.875%  unsecured notes and $1 billion in 4.85% unsecured notes.     Dividends favored over share repurchasing: Ample liquidity provided by consistent and strong FCF generation and large cash  balances allows Amgen to fund its financial strategy without increasing debt  levels. Amgen's financial policy targets an average return of 60% of adjusted  net income to shareholders.  Over the next two years, Fitch sees the company deploying more capital toward  dividends than share repurchases. Since 2011, the company purchased $12.9  billion in equity, utilizing all but $300 million of a $10 billion program  authorized in October 2011. Presently, Amgen has $2.3 billion of authorization  including $2 billion in new capacity in December 2012.  Amgen's board increased the quarterly rate of dividends to $0.47 per share for  the first two quarters of 2013 from $0.28 per share in 2011 which could result  in payments of $1.4 billion this year. Dividends paid in 2012 were $1.1 billion  compared to $500 million in 2011.    Long-term revenue growth despite patent losses:  Solid uptake of Amgen's most promising medicines - Prolia and Xgeva - mitigates  much pressure from the expiring patents, notably in 2015. Fitch anticipates that  sustained strong growth of these products and continued demand increases for the  company's bestseller Enbrel may yield compound annual growth of 1.5% in 2012 to  2017.  At the end of 2012, Amgen's maturing drug portfolio represented 48.1% of overall  company sales in 2012, excluding patent lapses in territories not covered by the  company.  Fitch expects to see competing biological drugs in the U.S. to two top-5 selling  drugs - Neupogen and Neulasta - over the next three years with a first-generation filgrastim treatment introduced by Teva Pharmaceutical  Industries as early as November 2013.  However, new competition to Amgen's biological therapies, either generic or  brand name, will not benefit from interchangeability upon launch, limiting their  inroads into the marketplace. Moreover, the number of potential drugmakers may  be modest given the high cost to develop and market generic biological  pharmaceuticals. As such, Fitch anticipates revenue declines from patent  expirations around 20% to 30% as opposed to the 80% to 90% typically seen with  patent lapses of small-molecule drugs. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive rating momentum depends upon a sustained decrease in debt leverage,  with gross debt leverage decreasing to between 2.5x and 3.0x. Positive action  would also require solid operational performance supported by underlying revenue  growth despite demand challenges from key drug patent expiration and new brand  name competition to Enbrel over the intermediate term. Fitch sees Amgen's presently high debt leverage dropping from EBITDA growth,  rather than debt reduction, accelerated by significant operating cost  improvement in 2014 stemming from the phased dissolution of the Enbrel  co-promotion with Pfizer.  However, significantly falling demand for the maturing drug portfolio could  jeopardize operational strength and impair leverage improvement. There is  limited flexibility in the rating for any increase in the presently high debt  leverage from either weak operating performance or debt funding of acquisitions  or shareholder returns. Fitch affirms the following: --IDR at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB'; --Bank loan at 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'.

128,AMGN,"Amgen first quarter sales disappoint, shares fall","(Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) on Tuesday reported first-quarter sales that fell short of Wall Street expectations for most of its biggest-selling medicines, and its shares fell more than 6 percent. Revenue for the quarter rose 5 percent to $4.24 billion, but was shy of Wall Street expectations of $4.37 billion. “It was a soft revenue quarter across the board. They missed on all the major products versus consensus and our expectations,” said Geoffrey Porges, a biotech analyst with Sanford Bernstein. “It reflects the maturity and increasing competitive intensity facing the company’s core products.” The world’s biggest biotechnology company did manage to post a profit that exceeded expectations. Excluding one time items, Amgen had adjusted earnings of $1.96, topping analysts’ average expectations by 12 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Amgen made up for the shortfall in expected sales “with a little bit of belt tightening and a likely non-recurring tax windfall,” Porges said. Amgen still expects full year revenue of $17.8 billion to $18.2 billion. But it said it now sees earnings per share coming in above the midpoint of its forecast range of $7.05 to $7.35 per share. Wall Street is estimating revenue of $18.07 billion and earnings of $7.21 per share. “We are well positioned to achieve our full year revenue growth projections,” Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Peacock told analysts on a conference call. The company posted a net profit of $1.43 billion, or $1.88 per share, compared with a profit of $1.18 billion, or $1.48 per share, a year ago. Amgen earlier this year said it planned to make a big push into biosimilars - cheaper alternative versions of biotech medicines - with plans to launch six beginning in 2017. On Tuesday, it said it would begin a pivotal clinical trial of its version of Roche’s ROG.VX multibillion-dollar breast cancer drug Herceptin during the current quarter. Sales of the blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel rose 11 percent to $1.04 billion in the first quarter, largely due to price increases. But that was short of Wall Street expectations of about $1.09 billion. The anemia drug Aranesp saw sales fall 10 percent to $468 million, well short of analysts’ estimates of about $490 million. Sales of the older anemia drug Epogen fell 2 percent to $435 million, missing Wall Street estimates of about $460 million. Both drugs have been in decline for years because of usage restrictions and safety concerns. The anemia franchise did not appear to benefit much from the withdrawal from the market due to serious safety concerns of a new rival product - Omontys from Affymax Inc AFFY.O. Even the fast growing newer drugs Xgeva, for preventing fractures due to cancer that has spread to the bones, and the related osteoporosis drug Prolia disappointed Wall Street. Xgeva sales grew 46 percent to $223 million, short of the $235 million Wall Street was looking for, while Prolia sales jumped 61 percent to $142 million, shy of expectations of about $159 million and down from the prior quarter’s $159 million. Amgen blamed the Prolia performance on what it called “seasonal softness,” and said it has seen a significant pickup in sales over the past six weeks. Combined worldwide sales of the white blood cell boosters Neupogen and Neulasta were flat at $1.34 billion. Amgen shares fell to $105.50 in extended trading from their Nasdaq close at $112.76.

133,AMGN,Amgen melanoma drug improved survival by 21 pct in interim look,"CHICAGO, June 1 (Reuters) - Data from a pivotal trial of Amgen Inc’s experimental melanoma therapy shows that it improved survival by 21 percent for patients with advanced forms of the deadly skin cancer compared with a standard white blood cell-boosting drug. Final survival results are not expected until later this year, but Wall Street has been awaiting the interim trial details to help assess the drug’s commercial potential within a new market of promising melanoma treatments. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said recently that the Amgen drug - talimogene laherparepvec, or T-Vec - will ultimately need to demonstrate that it improves overall survival by more than 15 percent. T-Vec is an engineered virus designed to be injected into tumors, where it replicates until membranes of the cancer cells rupture and die. The drug is then expected to activate a systemic immune response to kill tumor cells throughout the body. Other new drugs in the field include “immunotherapies,” such as Yervoy from Bristol-Myers Squibb, which is designed to harness the body’s immune system to fight the skin cancer. Amgen had said in March that the trial met its main goal of showing that T-Vec shrank tumors for at least six months in significantly more patients, 16 percent, than a comparison treatment, where the so-called durable response rate was 2 percent. Other new details of the trial, presented on Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, included an overall T-Vec response rate, meaning tumor shrinkage without the six-month requirement, of 26 percent. That compares with 6 percent for patients treated with GM-CSF, a type of white blood cell-booster. Eleven percent of T-Vec patients had their tumors eradicated. The trial also showed that patients with earlier-stage disease had the highest rates of durable response. That rate was 33 percent for stage III patients, compared with 8 percent for patients with the most advanced cancer. David Chang, head of global oncology development at Amgen, said the company is currently in discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration about how to move forward and seek regulatory approval. Melanoma is diagnosed in about 132,000 people worldwide each year. He also said the company is interested in testing its drug in combination with Yervoy and other new melanoma therapies. The most common side effects seen in the trial of over 400 patients were mild flu-like symptoms. Chang said Amgen is still evaluating whether to study T-Vec as a treatment for other types of cancer.",6012013,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-cancer-amgen/amgen-melanoma-drug-improved-survival-by-21-pct-in-interim-look-idUSL2N0EB1IQ20130601
134,AMGN,Amgen says drug slowed ovarian cancer in trial,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc’s trebananib drug for ovarian cancer extended the length of time that patients lived without the disease getting worse by about two months, meeting the main goal of a late-stage clinical trial, the company said on Wednesday. The trial is the first of three pivotal-stage studies of the experimental drug, and analysts said U.S. regulators will likely need to see evidence that trebananib extends overall patient survival before considering the drug for marketing approval. Amgen said median progression free survival (PFS) in the trial was 7.2 months for patients given trebananib and chemotherapy, compared with 5.4 months for patients treated with a placebo drug and chemotherapy. “This is an incremental positive as expectations were very modest,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said in a research note. “However, it remains uncertain, in our view, whether PFS benefit alone is sufficient for U.S. FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approval.” Shares of Amgen were down $1.05 at $96.88 in midday trading on Nasdaq. Trebananib is designed to block the process used by tumors to grow the blood and lymphatic vessels they need to survive and spread. Amgen said that while it was working on the primary analysis of overall survival for 2014, it saw a favorable survival trend in an interim analysis.

139,AMGN,Novartis tests copy of Amgen's Enbrel in late-stage trial,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sandoz, the generics unit of Novartis, has launched a late-stage trial with its biosimilar version of Amgen’s Enbrel, consolidating its leading position in developing cheaper copies of complex biotech drugs. With the start of the major study of its version of Enbrel, or etanercept, Sandoz now has seven Phase III clinical trials across five biosimilar molecules - more than any other company in the industry. Sandoz said on Monday the new trial aimed to confirm the biosimilarity of its product versus Enbrel in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis. Results will be used to support U.S. and European regulatory filings. Unlike traditional chemical drugs, biotech medicines consist of proteins derived from living organisms that cannot be replicated exactly. Generic copies, therefore, are more difficult to develop and market. IMS Health, a provider of data for the healthcare industry, expects global spending on biosimilars to increase to between $4 billion and $6 billion by 2016, from just $693 million in 2011.

The Financial Post said that documents it had seen said that Amgen had sent material to Onyx in which it said it would propose a cash acquisition worth about $10 billion and requested due diligence and a document review period. The Financial Post said that Amgen had sent the documents to Onyx about two weeks ago. Both companies are based in California. Amgen had sales of $17.3 billion in 2012, while Onyx brought in revenue of $362 million. Large biotech companies, once the targets of big pharmaceutical companies, have become acquirers themselves of smaller biotechs as their own stocks have run up and they have used low interest rates to bankroll their drug development. According to the Financial Post, the documents sent to Onyx said that Amgen was prepared to “move quickly to negotiate and execute a combination with you” and that the proposal did not have financing conditions on it. “Although we have reviewed Onyx extensively, our review has been limited to publicly available information. We would propose a focused, confirmatory due diligence and document review period,” the documents said, according to the Financial Post. It also said the proposal is subject to negotiation, conditions and board approval.

145,AMGN,"Pfizer, Novartis may join Amgen in bidding for Onyx: sources","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc ONXX.O, whose cancer drugs promise a strong revenue stream, is attracting preliminary buyout interest from several large pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Novartis AG NOVN.VX, two people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Onyx, a biotechnology company with a market value of around $9.5 billion, put itself up for sale on Sunday, citing “expressions of interest” from unnamed companies. It also said it had rejected a recent $8.7 billion offer from larger biotech Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) as too low. Pfizer, which is due to pay Onyx royalties on a promising experimental breast cancer drug, and Novartis, with a strong franchise of cancer medicines, are among the parties interested in Onyx and its portfolio of marketed cancer treatments, the two sources said. Amgen’s $120-per-share offer in June was its first and the company did not indicate if it was the best and final, according to a third person familiar with the matter, who expected Amgen to participate in the auction process. The offer represented a 38 percent premium to Onyx’s Friday closing share price of $86.82. Onyx surged 51.3 percent to close at $131.33 on Nasdaq on Monday, well above Amgen’s offer, suggesting investors expect bids to go much higher. San Francisco-based Onyx could appeal to a wider group of large biotech and pharmaceutical companies, including Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE), AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) and Merck & Co (MRK.N), several people familiar with the matter said. All the sources in this story were not authorized to speak with the media and asked not to be identified. An Onyx spokesperson declined to comment beyond the company’s statement on Sunday that it would reach out to potential buyers. Amgen, Pfizer, Novartis, Bayer and Merck declined to comment. AstraZeneca did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Shares of other mid-size biotech companies that have long been rumored as potential takeover targets also rose on Monday, as takeover interest in Onyx underscored the sector’s attractiveness. Large pharmaceutical and biotech companies have been looking to acquire smaller biotech firms to gain access to new drugs, often high-priced cancer treatments, as they face significant revenue losses stemming from expired patents. Ariad Pharmaceuticals ARIA.O jumped 11.7 percent to $19.53, Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc ISIS.O rose 5.95 percent to $28.47 and Seattle Genetics Inc (SGEN.O) climbed 3.97 percent to $32.71. Onyx sells Nexavar, a treatment for liver and kidney cancer, and the new colon cancer drug Stivarga - both in partnership with Germany’s Bayer. Onyx last year began selling Krypolis, which some analysts estimate will reach peak annual sales of $3 billion. In addition to very high prices - some new oncology medicines can cost more than $100,000 per patient - cancer drugs are desirable because they require relatively small sales forces and tend to be covered by medical insurers. Onyx is particularly attractive because it has three cancer drugs on the market - two of which are new with their best sales days ahead, while the third - Nexavar - is firmly established and being tested for additional uses. It has other promising drugs in its pipeline. Amgen has faced growing pressure to beef up its drug development pipeline as safety concerns trimmed sales of its flagship anemia drugs. The company is best known for these and other medicines used in supportive care of cancer patients. Patents on four of Amgen’s five top-selling drugs will expire, starting in 2015. Amgen Chief Executive Bob Bradway, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker, took over from Kevin Sharer just over a year ago. Amgen shares have risen more than 30 percent since then as investors applauded the company’s higher dividends and share repurchases. Amgen’s late-stage pipeline has several cancer drug candidates, including some acquired through takeovers. The company, which held more than $21 billion in cash at the end of March, has not done a deal for more than $1 billion since its buyout in 2006 of Abgenix for $2.2 billion. Amgen’s largest acquisition so far is Immunex Corp, which was valued at about $10 billion when completed in 2002.

148,AMGN,UPDATE 2-SEC alleges insider trading in Onyx ahead of Amgen offer,"* SEC says options trading led to 14,200 pct return * Trades believed tied to Canary Islands, Beirut * SEC says Citigroup, Barclays accounts used By Jonathan Stempel July 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a lawsuit accusing unnamed defendants of insider trading in Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc call options before the drugmaker publicly rejected a takeover bid by larger rival Amgen Inc and put itself up for sale. In a complaint filed on Wednesday with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the SEC said the “highly suspicious” trades took place between June 26 and 28, and resulted in a profit of about $4.6 million on a $305,000 investment. The SEC said this equated to a return of about 14,200 percent. An emergency court order freezing the assets of the traders was entered on Wednesday, the SEC said. On June 30, Onyx rejected as inadequate a $10 billion unsolicited takeover bid from Amgen that valued it at $120 per share, 38.2 percent above Onyx’s closing price the prior Friday, but said it would consider other potential acquirers. Shares of Onyx soared more than 51 percent on July 1. The SEC believes the defendants bought the options while possessing material nonpublic information about the Amgen offer, and seeks to recover illegal profits and impose civil fines. It said the traders used omnibus accounts at Citigroup Global Markets and Barclays Capital, and believes the traders or the accounts are in Canary Islands and Beirut. Amgen spokeswoman Christine Regan and Onyx spokeswoman Danielle Bertrand could not immediately be reached for comment. Citigroup spokeswoman Danielle Romero-Apsilos declined to comment. Barclays spokesman Mark Lane was not immediately available for comment. Call options give investors who expect a share price to rise the right to buy stock at a pre-set price. Options can result in large gains or losses relative to the sums invested. On Monday, Reuters reported a jump in Onyx options trading during the prior week Onyx is based in South San Francisco, California, and Amgen in Thousand Oaks, California. A study conducted for Reuters by Schaeffer’s Investment Research found that options trading activity often rises ahead of news about merger activity, stock repurchases or investments. In February, the SEC won a freeze on a Swiss account linked to suspicious trading in H.J. Heinz Co call options before the ketchup maker was bought by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and Brazilian firm 3G Capital. The case is SEC v.

149,AMGN,Novartis psoriasis drug superior to Enbrel in study,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis psoriasis drug secukinumab was superior to Amgen’s Enbrel in a late-stage study, the Swiss company said on Monday, putting it in line to become the first of a clutch of new treatments to gain market approval. A phase III trial involving 1,307 patients showed that secukinumab was more effective than Enbrel in clearing skin in patients with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis, a painful and unsightly skin condition that causes itching and scaling. Novartis said it expects to present full results of the study later in the year and that it is on track to file for regulatory approval by the end of the year. “These results, showing that secukinumab is superior to Enbrel, a current standard-of-care therapy, are great news for people living with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis,” said Tim Wright, global head of development at Novartis. Plaque psoriasis is thought to be caused by an inflammatory response initiated by the body’s immune system and affects about 125 million people. Those suffering from the disease are also at a greater risk of developing diabetes and heart disease. Novartis is among a pack of drugmakers developing new treatments for psoriasis, including Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, Celgene and Amgen. Analysts at Citi expect a flood of new treatments to help to more than double sales in the psoriasis market to $7.6 billion by 2022, from $3.6 billion in 2012. Kepler Chevreux analysts forecast peak sales of $701 million in 2020.

153,AMGN,Initial takeover bids for Onyx seen as soon as this week: sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc ONXX.O is expected to receive initial takeover bids as soon as this week after attracting interest from a few drugmakers, including Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), according to several people familiar with the matter. Amgen, whose opening offer of $120 per share was rejected by Onyx’s board in late June and led to an auction of the company, is still keen to buy Onyx and appears to be the most likely buyer, the people said this week. Other pharmaceutical companies including Pfizer (PFE.N), Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) and Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) have also been evaluating a deal, though it remains unclear if those parties will proceed with offers given Onyx’s rich valuation - with a market value of nearly $10 billion, the people said. While a number of big pharmaceutical and smaller biotech companies signed confidentiality agreements to take an initial look, many of the parties balked at Onyx’s price tag and decided against bidding for the cancer drugmaker, the people said. There is no specific date for first-round bids, but interested parties are expected to submit non-binding offers this week, the sources said, asking not to be named because details of the auction are not public. Representatives for Onyx and Pfizer declined to comment. Bristol-Myers, Gilead and Amgen could not be immediately reached for comment. Shares of Onyx have surged more than 50 percent since June 30 when it put itself up for sale citing expressions of interest from Amgen and other third parties. Onyx shares closed up 1.2 percent at $132.71 on Tuesday. The steep stock price increase has deterred several drugmakers, leaving a relatively short list of remaining bidders just two weeks into the process, the people said. The drugmakers, which have opted not to pursue a deal, include Novartis AG NOVN.VX, GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L), Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) and Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O), the people familiar with the matter said. The companies declined to comment. Onyx hopes to wrap up the auction by the end of the summer, some of the people added. Large pharmaceutical and biotech companies have been looking to acquire smaller biotech firms to gain access to new drugs and offset revenue losses stemming from expired patents, but rich valuations of target companies are proving to be a big hurdle to dealmaking. Meanwhile, U.S. investment firm Royalty Pharma ROYPH.UL is interested in buying some of the royalty streams should a winning bidder emerge for Onyx, according to the people familiar with the matter. There are no active discussions underway for now, and the likelihood of such a deal remains low, as most of the potential buyers are in a position to acquire the entire company and do not need a side deal to sell off royalties, the people added. A representative for Royalty Pharma declined to comment. Onyx sells Nexavar, a treatment for liver and kidney cancer, and the new colon cancer drug Stivarga - both in partnership with Germany’s Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE).

156,AMGN,Exclusive: Pfizer not moving forward with Onyx bid: sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc decided not to pursue a bid for Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc this week, according to two people familiar with the matter, leaving Amgen Inc in the front position to buy the cancer drugmaker. Shares of Onyx closed down 3.3 percent at $128.55 on Thursday, their lowest level since it announced a sale process on June 30 and valuing the South San Francisco, California-based company at around $9.3 billion. Onyx, which rejected Amgen’s $120 per share bid and instead put itself up for sale, was expecting to receive first-round offers from a few interested parties as soon as this week, people familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Pfizer, among the drugmakers that have been evaluating a bid as recently as a few days ago, has decided not to move forward, mainly on concerns that Onyx has become too expensive after a recent run-up in its share price, the people said on Thursday. The sources asked not to be named because details of the auction are not public. Pfizer, Onyx and Amgen declined to comment. A few other drugmakers that showed interest, such as Gilead Sciences Inc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and AstraZeneca Plc, have also been deterred by price, the people familiar with the matter said, though the companies’ latest position could not be confirmed as of Thursday. Gilead and AstraZeneca declined to comment. Bristol-Myers did not respond to requests for comment. Shares of Onyx, which closed at $86.82 on June 28 before news of the sale process, have since surged more than 50 percent.

157,AMGN,DEALTALK-Biotech takeover interest more fad than fashion,"By Deena Beasley July 19 (Reuters) - Investors betting on a wave of big biotechnology deals following Amgen Inc’s $10 billion bid for Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc may well be disappointed. Shares of companies like BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc , Seattle Genetics Inc, Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc and Clovis Oncology Inc  have all rallied on news late last month that Onyx had spurned Amgen’s offer. Experts in the field agree that the bid, rejected as inadequate by Onyx, confirms a healthy interest in small to mid-cap biotechs, but said it does not raise the likelihood of more deals in the already hot sector. A major reason is that valuations have gotten very rich, with the Nasdaq Biotech Index up more than 43 percent in the past 12 months. Some of the companies concerned also have existing drug development agreements with larger drugmakers, making takeovers more complicated and potentially more expensive. “People are being more disciplined and saying, yes I wish I would have bought it for $2 billion a few years ago, but I’m not going to turn that regret into overpayment now,” said an M&A; lawyer familiar with the industry. The sector-wide rally, while making it more difficult for larger companies to put together an economically feasible deal, has also eased the pressure on smaller companies who may not be interested in being acquired. Amgen’s takeover interest in Onyx was followed by news last week that Switzerland’s Roche Holding AG sought financing to mount a bid for Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc , sending the smaller company’s shares up 10 percent. With Alexion now valued at nearly $22 billion, chances for a near-term deal have been further complicated. “I don’t think this will drive a biotech buying frenzy,” said Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen. She noted that whoever ends up acquiring Onyx might also have been the logical buyer of a company like BioMarin, which develops high-priced drugs used to treat rare genetic diseases. Amgen’s move highlights the appeal of oncology companies like Onyx, which sells drugs for liver, kidney and colon cancer in partnership with Germany’s Bayer AG. The company’s crown jewel is considered to be Kyprolis, a blood cancer drug fully owned by Onyx which was approved by regulators last year. Alexion sells just one drug, but it is a premium-priced treatment for a very rare disease that Deutsche Bank estimates will achieve peak annual sales of $4.6 billion by 2018. “I don’t necessarily believe this puts every company in play,” said Clay Siegall, Chief Executive Officer at Seattle Genetics, which has seen its shares rise 20 percent since mid-June. “There will be more (deals) with time but I don’t think it changes the environment.” He said the focus at Seattle Genetics remains expanding use of its lymphoma drug Adcetris. “Right now we are an emerging company ... we have a great trajectory in the future,” Siegall said. “I believe that our big shareholders are supportive of that. I don’t have any pressure on me to try to run out and do some deal.” The last major biotech deal was in 2011 when French drugmaker Sanofi SA acquired Genzyme, another maker of medicines to treat very rare conditions, or “orphan” diseases, for $20 billion. On June 30, Onyx rejected the unsolicited Amgen bid of $120 a share - a premium of about 38 percent to the company’s share price. Onyx said it would consider other potential buyers and its shares have since soared nearly 47 percent. On Thursday, sources familiar with the matter said that Pfizer Inc  had decided not to pursue a competing bid, leaving Amgen in the pole position for a takeover and shares of Onyx fell back to the $128 range. The Onyx offer “says more about Amgen than it does about the deal environment,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges. “Onyx fits really well with what Amgen needs. Amgen has a scarcity of near term growth opportunities and a surplus of infrastructure.” Onyx is fairly unique in its status as a biotech company on the verge of becoming profitable. “The buyers recognize that and I think they are really going to step up,” Porges said. BioMarin is also close to becoming a profit-making company, but CEO Jean-Jacques Bienaime said earlier this year that he would not consider a buyout offer for even a 25-30 percent premium. Shares of BioMarin, which topped Morningstar’s 2013 list of biotech takeover candidates, have gained nearly 8 percent in the last month. Onyx was No. 4 on that list, which included companies like Seattle Genetics and Regeneron. Price is a potential obstacle for buyouts of other perennial takeover targets. Andersen said an acquisition of Regeneron - up more than 11 percent in the last month - has become more problematic given the near doubling in its share price so far this year. Sanofi also holds a big stake in Regeneron. “Most of these companies would be in the high single-digit or low double-digit billions, whereas with Regeneron you are talking a market cap closer to $22 or $23 billion,” Andersen said. “Apply a premium to that ... you have a risky proposition.” Ariad, with shares up 11 percent since the Onyx news, has a commercial product, leukemia drug Iclusig, but its revenue potential is comparatively limited. It also has a pipeline of experimental drugs that will require investment. Others are encumbered by existing development deals with larger companies. Medivation Inc - up 17 percent over the past week - has partnered its promising prostate cancer drug with Japan’s Astellas Pharma Inc, while Pharmacyclics Inc - up 18 percent - is developing leukemia drug ibrutinib in partnership with Johnson & Johnson. “Seattle Genetics is a very rational acquisition target,” Porges said. “But the case of Seattle Genetics is nothing like the case of Onyx where Onyx has already got the cash coming in. Turn off the spending and it automatically becomes profitable.” Meanwhile, neither Roche or Alexion have commented on whether they are in discussions, but some analysts have questioned whether such a costly acquisition would make sense for Roche, which is best known for its innovative cancer medicines and diagnostics business. “We haven’t had a rally like this in more than 10 years - where all the stocks go up and the valuations go out the window,” said Summer Street Research analyst Carol Werther. “Once this trend reverses it is going to be very, very ugly.”",7192013,http://www.reuters.com/article/biotechnology/dealtalk-biotech-takeover-interest-more-fad-than-fashion-idUSL1N0FO1OD20130719

159,AMGN,Amgen profit tops Wall Street view; rebounds from first quarter,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), which is attempting to buy Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc ONXX.O to add to its cancer drug offerings, on Tuesday reported higher-than-expected second- quarter profit as sales of many of its medicines rebounded from a disappointing first quarter. Most of Amgen’s higher profile products had sales that exceeded Wall Street estimates, and the world’s largest biotechnology company raised its full-year earnings forecast. Excluding special items, Amgen earned $1.89 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 15 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Many analysts had tempered their second-quarter forecasts after being caught off guard by a weaker-than-expected first quarter. “Overall, it was a very solid quarter. Amgen is clearly back on track after sloppy first quarter,” said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt. “It was nice that the guidance was bumped up too,” he added. Amgen said it now expects 2013 adjusted earnings of $7.30 to $7.45 per share. It had previously forecast earnings above the midpoint of $7.05 to $7.35. The company also said full-year revenue was expected to come in at the upper end of its previously forecast range of $17.8 billion to $18.2 billion, and that its tax rate for the year would be between 9 percent and 10 percent. “We are carrying good momentum into the third and fourth quarters and are on track to deliver solid revenue and earnings growth for the year as indicated by our increased guidance,” Amgen Chief Executive Robert Bradway told analysts on a conference call. Revenue for the quarter rose 5 percent to $4.68 billion, topping analysts’ average estimates of $4.49 billion. The increased revenue was helped by a 9 percent increase in sales of the rheumatoid arthritis treatment Enbrel and a surge in demand for newer, fast-growing products Xgeva and Prolia. Product sales included a positive adjustment of $185 million to previous estimates for managed Medicaid rebates based on recent claims experience, the company said. The company posted a net profit of $1.26 billion, or $1.65 per share, compared with a profit of $1.26 billion, $1.61 per share, a year ago. Research and development costs jumped 17 percent to $967 million, primarily due to expenses associated with the high profile experimental cholesterol drug AMG 145. The company expects key data in the first quarter of 2014 on the drug that is from a promising new class of medicines called PCS-K9 inhibitors. Enbrel posted sales of $1.16 billion for the quarter, edging past analyst estimates of about $1.14 billion and up from $1.04 billion in the first quarter. Sales of the white blood cell boosters Neupogen and Neulasta had combined sales of $1.44 billion, an increase of 7 percent and ahead of analysts’ estimates of about $1.37 billion. Xgeva for preventing fractures once cancer has spread to the bones saw sale sales jump 39 percent to $249 million, surpassing Wall Street expectations of about $241 million. The related osteoporosis drug Prolia posted a 57 percent increase in sales to $188 million. Wall Street had been looking for about $173 million. The decline in sales of the red blood cell booster Aranesp slowed with sales down only 2 percent to $524 million, exceeding Wall Street estimates of $491 million and the previous quarter’s $468 million. Sales of the older anemia drug Epogen fell 4 percent to $502 million, ahead of expectations of $477 million. Sales of both drugs have been declining for years over usage and reimbursement restrictions and safety concerns, in part fueling Amgen’s interest in acquiring newer, growing medicines, such as Onyx’s Kyprolis for multiple myeloma. Amgen’s initial offer of $120 per share for Onyx was rejected as too low, but it is still considered the leading contender to acquire the company. The company also announced plans to acquire the U.S. commercial rights to a heart failure drug developed by France’s Servier that is sold in Europe under the brand name Procoralan. After initially rising 1.4 percent in extended trading, Amgen shares slipped about 1 percent to $109.99. They closed at $111.20 on Nasdaq and are up about 28 percent for the year.

Most of Amgen’s higher profile products had sales that exceeded Wall Street estimates, and the world’s largest biotechnology company raised its full-year earnings forecast. Excluding special items, Amgen earned $1.89 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 15 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Many analysts had tempered their second-quarter forecasts after being caught off guard by a weaker-than-expected first quarter. “Overall, it was a very solid quarter. Amgen is clearly back on track after sloppy first quarter,” said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt. “It was nice that the guidance was bumped up too,” he added. Amgen said it now expects 2013 adjusted earnings of $7.30 to $7.45 per share. It had previously forecast earnings above the midpoint of $7.05 to $7.35. The company also said full-year revenue was expected to come in at the upper end of its previously forecast range of $17.8 billion to $18.2 billion, and that its tax rate for the year would be between 9 percent and 10 percent. “We are carrying good momentum into the third and fourth quarters and are on track to deliver solid revenue and earnings growth for the year as indicated by our increased guidance,”  Amgen Chief Executive Robert Bradway told analysts on a conference call. Revenue for the quarter rose 5 percent to $4.68 billion, topping analysts’ average estimates of $4.49 billion. The increased revenue was helped by a 9 percent increase in sales of the rheumatoid arthritis treatment Enbrel and a surge in demand for newer, fast-growing products Xgeva and Prolia. Product sales included a positive adjustment of $185 million to previous estimates for managed Medicaid rebates based on recent claims experience, the company said. The company posted a net profit of $1.26 billion, or $1.65 per share, compared with a profit of $1.26 billion, $1.61 per share, a year ago. Research and development costs jumped 17 percent to $967 million, primarily due to expenses associated with the high profile experimental cholesterol drug AMG 145. The company expects key data in the first quarter of 2014 on the drug that is from a promising new class of medicines called PCS-K9 inhibitors. Enbrel posted sales of $1.16 billion for the quarter, edging past analyst estimates of about $1.14 billion and up from $1.04 billion in the first quarter. Sales of the white blood cell boosters Neupogen and Neulasta had combined sales of $1.44 billion, an increase of 7 percent and ahead of analysts’ estimates of about $1.37 billion. Xgeva for preventing fractures once cancer has spread to the bones saw sale sales jump 39 percent to $249 million, surpassing Wall Street expectations of about $241 million. The related osteoporosis drug Prolia posted a 57 percent increase in sales to $188 million. Wall Street had been looking for about $173 million. The decline in sales of the red blood cell booster Aranesp slowed with sales down only 2 percent to $524 million, exceeding Wall Street estimates of $491 million and the previous quarter’s $468 million. Sales of the older anemia drug Epogen fell 4 percent to $502 million, ahead of expectations of $477 million. Sales of both drugs have been declining for years over usage and reimbursement restrictions and safety concerns, in part fueling Amgen’s interest in acquiring newer, growing medicines, such as Onyx’s Kyprolis for multiple myeloma. Amgen’s initial offer of $120 per share for Onyx was rejected as too low, but it is still considered the leading contender to acquire the company. The company also announced plans to acquire the U.S. commercial rights to a heart failure drug developed by France’s Servier that is sold in Europe under the brand name Procoralan. After initially rising 1.4 percent in extended trading, Amgen shares slipped about 1 percent to $109.99. They closed at $111.20 on Nasdaq and are up about 28 percent for the year.

163,AMGN,Amgen seen raising bid to acquire Onyx Pharmaceuticals -report,"Aug 6 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc is expected to sweeten its offer to acquire Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc to $130 per share after its previous bid was rejected as too low, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the matter. After Amgen’s unsolicited offer of $120 per share was turned down, Onyx said in June it was seeking takeover bids from other potential buyers. The $130 offer is currently the highest bid on the table for Onyx, according the anonymous source, the report said. A spokeswoman for Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology company, declined to comment on the report. Onyx also declined to comment. The purchase would give Amgen full rights to Onyx’s new blood cancer drug Kyprolis, as well as revenue from Nexavar, a kidney and liver cancer drug Onyx shares with German drugmaker Bayer AG.

165,AMGN,Amgen deal for Onyx possible within week-sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc is close to selling itself to larger rival Amgen Inc as the cancer drugmaker’s high stock price has discouraged other companies from making a counteroffer so far, according to three people familiar with the matter. Amgen (AMGN.O), the world’s largest biotechnology company, is in advanced discussions to buy Onyx ONXX.O, with the two sides working toward a possible announcement as soon as within the next week, the sources said on Wednesday. Terms of an agreement have yet to be finalized, but the companies are negotiating a price of $130 per share, or nearly $9.5 billion based on shares outstanding. Onyx has indicated it would likely accept a deal at that price, the sources said. Discussions could still fall apart, and there was no guarantee an agreement will be reached, according to the sources, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Shares of Amgen jumped 6.8 percent to $112.40 on news of a likely deal, hitting their highest level since April. Onyx shares fell almost 3 percent to $128.21. Representatives of Amgen and Onyx declined to comment. A few other drugmakers including AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) (AZN.N) have also evaluated a deal in recent weeks but it was unclear if a rival bid would emerge, one of the people said. An AstraZeneca spokeswoman said the company does not comment on market speculation. A deal at $130 per share would be about 8 percent higher than Amgen’s initial offer of $120 per share. Onyx’s board rejected that bid as too low in late June. Before the move on Wednesday, Onyx’s stock had surged more than 50 percent from the closing price of $86.82 on June 28, the last trading price before the sale process was reported. The steep price gains, as well as the floor price that Amgen has set with its initial $120 per-share offer, deterred several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that would otherwise have been interested in bidding, people familiar with the matter said previously. South San Francisco, California-based Onyx sells Nexavar, a treatment for liver and kidney cancer, and the new colon cancer drug Stivarga - both in partnership with Germany’s Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE). Onyx last year began selling Kyprolis for multiple myeloma, which some analysts estimate will reach peak annual sales of $3 billion. Cancer medicines are the holy grail for many drugmakers because current products have limited effectiveness and the companies can charge huge prices for new biotech treatments. Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen has faced growing pressure to beef up its drug development pipeline as safety concerns have trimmed sales of its flagship anemia drugs, while patents on four of its five top-selling drugs are set to expire, starting in 2015. The company is best known for these and other medicines used for cancer patients.

177,AMGN,Exclusive: Onyx provides drug trial data to potential bidders - sources,"(Reuters) - Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc has given potential buyers, including Amgen Inc, access to trial data on its new cancer drug, removing a key hurdle that was holding up deal talks, according to three people familiar with the matter. The company’s attempt to sell itself for around $9.5 billion hit an impasse in recent weeks after lead bidder Amgen sought trial data about blood cancer drug Kyprolis - something that Onyx was reluctant to share, Reuters reported last week. Onyx made more information available this week to Amgen and other parties involved in the sale process, and is now waiting for a firm offer, the people said on Wednesday. Discussions could still fall apart and there is no guarantee a deal will happen, they cautioned. All the people were not authorized to speak with the media and asked not to be identified. Representatives for Onyx and Amgen declined to comment. Amgen, the drugmaker in advanced talks to buy Onyx for $130 per share, or about $9.5 billion based on shares outstanding, had asked to see data from an ongoing trial on Kyprolis in order to better evaluate the treatment, people familiar with the matter said previously. Onyx had been reluctant to meet the request because the study is continuing. Details of the trial data that Onyx made available to potential buyers could not be learned, but one of the people said bidders have all the data that Onyx has access to. South San Francisco, California-based Onyx put itself up for sale in late June after spurning a $120-per-share offer from Amgen as significantly undervaluing the company. While Onyx has been in talks with other parties, including AstraZeneca, it remains unclear if a rival bid will emerge. Access to the trial data had proved to be a sticking point in the negotiations since the sales potential of Kyprolis - a drug with the generic name of carfilzomib that treats multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer - hinges on the outcome of the clinical studies. The drug was approved last year by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration based on robust mid-stage trial results, but full approval is contingent on the outcome of Phase 3 trials. Kyprolis, given intravenously, is currently used for patients whose myeloma has worsened despite at least two prior therapies. Successful trials would allow Onyx to expand that to patients who have failed just one treatment - a larger market currently dominated by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd’s Velcade. Velcade, sold by Takeda in the United States and Johnson & Johnson in Europe and the rest of the world, generated sales near $2.2 billion in fiscal 2012. Wall Street analysts, on average, have forecast that Kyprolis will outstrip that, reaching $2.23 billion by 2018, according to Thomson Pharma. Both Kyprolis and Velcade are members of a class known as proteasome inhibitors. Bullishness over the Onyx drug stems largely from the fact that it causes fewer central nervous system side effects such as neuropathy, or nerve pain. However, the Kyprolis label does list several warnings, including a risk of heart problems. The label notes that cardiac failure was reported in 7 percent of mid-stage trial patients. “There have been concerns raised about carfilzomib possibly having more cardiac effects than Velcade and possibly more kidney issues,” said Dr Robert Orlowski, professor in the department of lymphoma/myeloma at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. “We need to have the randomized study results.” The Onyx drug irreversibly binds to and blocks activity of a proteasome, responsible for digesting proteins inside cells that the cells no longer need. Velcade also targets the proteasome, but is known as a “slowly reversible” inhibitor. “There may be longer inhibition with carfilzomib,” said Dr Orlowski. “Every cell in the body, including heart cells, have proteasomes in them.” ",8212013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-onyx-deal/exclusive-onyx-provides-drug-trial-data-to-potential-bidders-sources-idUSBRE97K18C20130821
178,AMGN,Amgen close to buying Onyx for $125 per share: sources,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) is close to buying Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc ONXX.O for $125 per share, or more than $10 billion, in a deal that is expected to be announced as soon as Monday, two people familiar with the matter said on Saturday. A deal, which is still being finalized and would require board approval from both companies, would represent the fifth-largest biotechnology deal in history. The proposed takeover would value Onyx at 13 times the company’s expected revenues for next year, one of the richest valuations in biotech takeovers, one of the people said. The people asked not to be identified because the matter is not public. Representatives for Amgen and Onyx could not be immediately reached for comment. The acquisition of Onyx would give Amgen full rights to Kyprolis, the new multiple myeloma drug that analysts expect to reach annual peak sales in excess of $2 billion. Amgen would also gain a revenue stream from the liver and kidney cancer drug Nexavar that Onyx shares with Bayer AG, as well as royalty payments on Bayer’s much newer colon cancer drug Stivarga and potential future royalties on an experimental breast cancer drug being developed by Pfizer. A deal in the $10 billion range would be Amgen’s biggest since its $16 billion acquisition of Immunex in 2001 that gave it the rheumatoid arthritis drug, Enbrel, which is one of Amgen’s most important, biggest-selling products. It would be by far the biggest deal under CEO Bob Bradway, who took over the top spot in May 2012. He has done a handful of much smaller deals, the biggest to date being a $1.16 billion acquisition of Micromet. Onyx shares closed at $116.96 on Friday. Amgen offered to pay $120 per share for the company in June but Onyx said that bid significantly undervalued the company and put itself up for sale. An Onyx deal would also give Amgen a much higher profile in oncology. Several of its current drugs offer supportive care for cancer patients, such as to treat anemia or decreases in white blood cells caused by chemotherapy. Another of its newer medicines, Xgeva, helps prevent fractures in patients whose cancers have spread to the bone. Its one product that treats cancer, the colon cancer drug Vectibix, has largely been a disappointment. Analysts are expecting Onyx revenue to reach $878 million in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Geoffrey Porges, long-time biotech analyst for Sanford Bernstein, projected that an Onyx acquisition would boost Amgen revenue by 5 percent to 6 percent near term, rising to 20 percent by 2021. He sees Amgen EPS declining by 3 percent to 4 percent in 2014 with the purchase of Onyx, but increasing by 8 percent in 2016 and growing to an increase of 22 percent in 2019. Two of Amgen’s biggest products - the anemia drugs Aranesp and Epogen - have been in decline for years, while others are fairly mature at this point. The New York Times first reported on Saturday that the two companies were near a deal.

180,AMGN,Amgen seeks to bolster drug pipeline with $10.4 billion Onyx buy,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) struck a deal to buy cancer drug maker Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc ONXX.O for about $10.4 billion on Sunday, as it moves to restock its product pipeline in response to declining sales of its flagship anemia drugs. The acquisition - which ends a two-month-long auction of Onyx - represents the fifth-largest biotechnology deal in history. It gives Amgen full rights to Kyprolis, the new multiple myeloma drug that analysts expect to reach annual peak sales in excess of $2 billion. The world’s largest biotechnology company will also gain a revenue stream from the liver and kidney cancer drug Nexavar that Onyx shares with Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE), as well as royalty payments on Bayer’s much newer colon cancer drug, Stivarga, and potential future royalties on an experimental breast cancer drug being developed by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N). Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen has faced growing pressure to beef up its drug development pipeline as safety concerns have trimmed sales of its flagship anemia drugs, Aranesp and Epogen. Also, patents on four of its five top-selling drugs are set to expire starting in 2015. Cancer medicines are the holy grail for many drugmakers because current products have limited effectiveness and the companies can charge steep prices for new biotech treatments. Amgen said it will pay $125 per share for Onyx, a 4.2 percent increase from the $120 a share it offered in June. Onyx said that bid significantly undervalued the company and put itself up for sale. The companies expect the deal to close in the beginning of the fourth quarter. Amgen expects it to add to adjusted net income in 2015. Onyx shares closed at $116.96 on Friday. They closed at $85.50 on June 28, before reports of Amgen’s $120-a-share bid surfaced.

182,AMGN,Bradway's patient dealmaking brings Onyx to Amgen,"New YORK (Reuters) - Investment banker turned biotech chief executive, Robert Bradway, staked a claim as a savvy dealmaker with Amgen Inc’s (AMGN.O) successful acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc ONXX.O for more than $10 billion. In doing so, he managed to avoid falling into traps that an inexperienced CEO might make with the stakes so high, while potentially quieting some criticism over the choice of a former banker to lead the world’s largest biotechnology company. “Because of his experience as an investment banker, he was able to avoid a lot of the mistakes that a lot of rookie CEOs make in acquisitions,” said a source familiar with the sale process, who wished to remain anonymous because he is not permitted to speak to the media. “He was very disciplined and was willing to wait effectively two months for the process to play out,” the person added. The deal gives Amgen an immediate new revenue stream, bolsters its drug development pipeline and places Amgen much more solidly into the oncology space, which features among the most high priced and highly sought after medicines in the healthcare industry. Bradway, 50, who was a healthcare investment banker at Morgan Stanley (MS.N) prior to joining Amgen in 2006, replaced long-time CEO Kevin Sharer in May of 2012, after stints as vice president of operations strategy and chief financial officer. Since taking the helm of Amgen, Bradway has engineered a handful of small deals to add to Amgen’s experimental drug pipeline - the largest, a $1.16 billion acquisition of Micromet - but had primarily placated shareholders with share buybacks and increasing dividend payments. While Amgen shares are up more than 60 percent on Bradway’s watch - including a nearly 8 percent rise on Monday - many of the company’s key products are mature or declining and likely to face competition from cheaper rivals over the next few years. Those who viewed Amgen as a growth company were clamoring for a big move. Several of Amgen’s current drugs offer supportive care for cancer patients, such as to treat anemia (Aranesp) or decreases in white blood cells caused by chemotherapy (Neupogen and Neulasta). Another of its newer medicines, Xgeva, helps prevent fractures in cancer that has spread to the bone. It’s one product that actually treats cancer, the colon cancer drug Vectibix, has largely been a disappointment. “This is a bit of a bold stroke,” Christopher Raymond, analyst at Robert W. Baird and Co, said of the Onyx purchase, which gives Amgen full rights to the new multiple myeloma drug Kyprolis as well as other assets. “I credit them for doing something ... they need growth.” Sven Borho, a founding general partner of OrbiMed Advisors LLC, which holds a substantial position in both companies, was pleased by the deal from both sides. “Healthcare shareholders are relieved that Amgen management is doing something. Just paying a dividend and buying back your shares is not enough,” Borho said. “Finally they’re seeing the light that you have to generate value for your shareholders not just by financial engineering but by creating future revenues. This was long, long overdue,” Borho said. OrbiMed owns about 2.6 million Amgen shares and nearly 1.2 million Onyx shares, according to Thomson Reuters data. “Of all of the assets out there, Onyx was the quality oncology asset,” said Borho. Leerink Swann analyst Howard Liang agreed. “There are not that many opportunities where you can buy a fully-owned asset that moves the needle for Amgen,” Liang said Amgen had been criticized by some industry analysts for choosing an investment banker to run a company where science should be a priority. “He’s a real quick study ... takes a lot of interest in the science side of the business,” one former Amgen executive, who asked that his name not be used, said of Bradway. “He understands that the basis of Amgen is innovation and science.” But the Bradway’s investment banking background appears to have served him well as he oversaw the Onyx purchase process that began in June with Amgen’s unsolicited takeover offer of $120 per share, which was rejected as too low. After Onyx sought competing bids, the deal eventually got done at $125 per share. Some new CEOs may have just agreed to up their offer and overpay to make the deal happen quickly or walk away entirely, but Bradway did neither, said the person familiar with the deal. “We had the benefit of spending considerable time with the Onyx team, coming to know and understand in particular Kyprolis very well through that process,” Bradway told analysts on a conference call on Monday. “We reviewed the data that are available to us and our confidence is reflected in the price that we’ve moved forward the transaction with,” said Bradway, adding that Amgen will still be able to generate strong cash flow and have the flexibility to do smaller bolt-on deals in the United States, with even more flexibility outside the U.S. OrbiMed’s Borho said it was a big win that Amgen got the prize it sought without being forced to drive up its initial offer by too much. “They played it quite well looking from the outside in,” he said. “Investment bankers on both sides tried to spread rumors either to hold back the price or ratchet the bids up, and in the end Amgen was able to get the deal done without overpaying.” He said biotech merger and acquisition activity has been a boon to the acquirers and shareholders, citing Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY.N) purchase of Medarex and its melanoma drugs, and Gilead Sciences’ acquisition of Pharmasset to gain its highly promising hepatitis medicines, as potentially company transforming moves. “Big companies so many times are so worried about making a mistake acquiring assets too early. But the ones that work can generate so much shareholder value and that’s what all the healthcare dedicated investors want them to do,” Borho explained. “Take a risk. At least step up to the plate and take a swing and get some assets to grow your company,” he added.

183,AMGN,Onyx deal expected to give Amgen a big boost,"(Reuters) - Investors reacted favorably on Monday to Amgen Inc’s $10.4 billion purchase of Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc, which gives the world’s largest biotech company full rights to a blood cancer drug with multibillion-dollar sales potential. Amgen shares rose 9 percent in midday trade on news of the acquisition, the biggest biotech deal since Gilead Sciences Inc’s $11 billion purchase of Pharmasset in 2012. The main prize in the acquisition is Onyx’s blood cancer drug Kyprolis. Piper Jaffray analyst Ian Somaiya upgraded Amgen shares to “overweight” from “neutral” and raised his price target on the stock to $140 from $120, saying Kyprolis could generate sales of more than $3 billion by 2025. Brean Capital analyst Gene Mack said Kyprolis and Oprozomib, another blood cancer drug in development at Onyx, could produce combined sales of more than $4 billion. Kyprolis is used to treat multiple myeloma, the second most commonly diagnosed blood cancer. The disease attacks antibody-producing plasma cells, which are derived from a type of white blood cell. More than 20,000 Americans are expected to be diagnosed with multiple myeloma this year, according to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. Kyprolis competes with the Celgene Corp drug Revlimid. Celgene also has a new myeloma treatment, Pomalyst. “Given our view of the overall myeloma market and the growth we see over the next 3-5 years, we are not surprised by the interest in Onyx since it is our view that both Onyx and Celgene will be the primary beneficiaries of that growth,” Mack said in a note to clients. Kyprolis has been on the U.S. market for about a year and its sales have been climbing steadily, reaching $61 million in the second quarter. Onyx previously said plans were in place for a Kyprolis launch in Europe in the second half of 2014. Onyx also sells Nexavar, a treatment for liver and kidney cancer. Amgen has been looking for new ways to boost its product pipeline as sales of its flagship anemia drugs Aranesp and Epogen have been in decline for years because of usage restrictions and safety concerns. On a conference call with analysts on Monday, Amgen executives said they plan to file the tender offer for Onyx this week, with the deal expected to close as early as the week of September 30. Amgen Chief Executive Officer Bob Bradway, who took the helm of the Thousand Oaks, California-based company just over a year ago, has been able to keep investors happy with dividend increases and share repurchases. On the conference call, he said Amgen remained committed to raising its dividend over time after it completes the Onyx acquisition. He also said investors should not expect any significant share repurchases in 2014 or 2015. In the acquisition, announced on Sunday, Amgen will pay $125 a share for Onyx, a 4.2 percent increase from the $120 a share it offered in June. Shares of Amgen rose 9 percent to $115.05 in midday trading, while Onyx shares climbed 5.7 percent to $123.65.

Bradway, 50, who was a healthcare investment banker at Morgan Stanley prior to joining Amgen in 2006, replaced long-time CEO Kevin Sharer in May of 2012, after stints as vice president of operations strategy and chief financial officer. Since taking the helm of Amgen, Bradway has engineered a handful of small deals to add to Amgen’s experimental drug pipeline - the largest, a $1.16 billion acquisition of Micromet - but had primarily placated shareholders with share buybacks and increasing dividend payments. While Amgen shares are up more than 60 percent on Bradway’s watch - including a nearly 8 percent rise on Monday - many of the company’s key products are mature or declining and likely to face competition from cheaper rivals over the next few years. Those who viewed Amgen as a growth company were clamoring for a big move. Several of Amgen’s current drugs offer supportive care for cancer patients, such as to treat anemia (Aranesp) or decreases in white blood cells caused by chemotherapy (Neupogen and Neulasta). Another of its newer medicines, Xgeva, helps prevent fractures in cancer that has spread to the bone. Its one product that actually treats cancer, the colon cancer drug Vectibix, has largely been a disappointment. “This is a bit of a bold stroke,” Christopher Raymond, analyst at Robert W. Baird and Co, said of the Onyx purchase, which gives Amgen full rights to the new multiple myeloma drug Kyprolis as well as other assets. “I credit them for doing something ... they need growth.” Sven Borho, a founding general partner of OrbiMed Advisors LLC, which holds a substantial position in both companies, was pleased by the deal from both sides. “Healthcare shareholders are relieved that Amgen management is doing something. Just paying a dividend and buying back your shares is not enough,” Borho said. “Finally they’re seeing the light that you have to generate value for your shareholders not just by financial engineering but by creating future revenues. This was long, long overdue,” Borho said. OrbiMed owns about 2.6 million Amgen shares and nearly 1.2 million Onyx shares, according to Thomson Reuters data. “Of all of the assets out there, Onyx was the quality oncology asset,” said Borho. Leerink Swann analyst Howard Liang agreed. “There are not that many opportunities where you can buy a fully-owned asset that moves the needle for Amgen,” Liang said Amgen had been criticized by some industry analysts for choosing an investment banker to run a company where science should be a priority. “He’s a real quick study ... takes a lot of interest in the science side of the business,” one former Amgen executive, who asked that his name not be used, said of Bradway. “He understands that the basis of Amgen is innovation and science.” But the Bradway’s investment banking background appears to have served him well as he oversaw the Onyx purchase process that began in June with Amgen’s unsolicited takeover offer of $120 per share, which was rejected as too low. After Onyx sought competing bids, the deal eventually got done at $125 per share. Some new CEOs may have just agreed to up their offer and overpay to make the deal happen quickly or walk away entirely, but Bradway did neither, said the person familiar with the deal. “We had the benefit of spending considerable time with the Onyx team, coming to know and understand in particular Kyprolis very well through that process,” Bradway told analysts on a conference call on Monday. “We reviewed the data that are available to us and our confidence is reflected in the price that we’ve moved forward the transaction with,” said Bradway, adding that Amgen will still be able to generate strong cash flow and have the flexibility to do smaller bolt-on deals in the United States, with even more flexibility outside the U.S. OrbiMed’s Borho said it was a big win that Amgen got the prize it sought without being forced to drive up its initial offer by too much. “They played it quite well looking from the outside in,” he said. “Investment bankers on both sides tried to spread rumors either to hold back the price or ratchet the bids up, and in the end Amgen was able to get the deal done without overpaying.” He said biotech merger and acquisition activity has been a boon to the acquirers and shareholders, citing Bristol-Myers Squibb’s purchase of Medarex and its melanoma drugs, and Gilead Sciences’ acquisition of Pharmasset to gain its highly promising hepatitis medicines, as potentially company transforming moves. “Big companies so many times are so worried about making a mistake acquiring assets too early. But the ones that work can generate so much shareholder value and that’s what all the healthcare dedicated investors want them to do,” Borho explained. “Take a risk. At least step up to the plate and take a swing and get some assets to grow your company,” he added.

Wall Street had been trading higher until Kerry’s comment in midafternoon. Adding to the market’s geopolitical nervousness,  the White House said evidence of Syria’s use of chemical weapons was undeniable. Stocks rose for most of the session, as sharply weaker orders for long-lasting manufactured goods eased investors’ worries of a cutback in economic stimulus. “The turnaround (in stocks) is probably a reaction to the Secretary of State Kerry’s comments. We are seeing signs of escalation here and geopolitical concerns are trumping,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 53.84 points, or 0.36 percent, at 14,956.67. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was down 6.38 points, or 0.38 percent, at 1,657.12.

Onyx shares rose 5.6 percent to $123.48 and Amgen jumped 8 percent to $113.93. The NYSEArca biotech index climbed 2.4 percent. Earlier, data showed durable goods orders dropped 7.3 percent in July, the biggest decline in nearly a year.

Durable goods orders dropped 7.3 percent in July, the biggest decline in nearly a year. In addition, a gauge of planned business spending on capital goods tumbled, casting a shadow over the economy early in the third quarter. The reports and other data for July have suggested economic growth this quarter will probably not accelerate as much as economists had hoped. Investors were heartened because the Fed has said any  decision to slow its $85 billion a month in bond purchases, which has helped drive the S&P; 500 index’s rise of nearly 17 percent this year, depends on a recovering economy. “Clearly the durable goods number, particularly if you dig down in there, was not encouraging,” said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany, New York. “If there is anything that is driving the markets today, it is that the durable goods numbers were weaker than expected and that raises the question the Federal Reserve might not begin to taper.” The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield hit its lowest in a week following the data. A recent spike in yields has raised concerns that mortgage rates and consumer credit will climb too high and harm the economy’s recovery. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 29.41 points or 0.2 percent, to 15,039.92, the S&P; 500 gained 4.31 points or 0.26 percent, to 1,667.81 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 22.747 points or 0.62 percent, to 3,680.539. Amgen Inc was the biggest boost to both the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes after it struck a deal to buy cancer drug maker Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc for about $10.4 billion, sweetening its original offer made in June. Onyx shares rose 5.7 percent to $123.62 and Amgen jumped 9 percent to $115.12. The NYSEArca biotech index climbed 2.4 percent. U.N. chemical weapons experts interviewed and took blood samples from individuals in a suburb of Syria’s capital where rebels said the government carried out a poison gas attack last week.

Three sources familiar with the deal said on Monday that Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, has reached agreement in principle with the Pentagon on a contract to build engines for F-35 Joint Strike Fighters in a deal valued at over $1 billion. United Tech shares edged up 0.4 percent to $103.23.

Durable goods orders recorded their biggest drop in nearly a year in July and a gauge of planned business spending on capital goods tumbled, casting a shadow over the economy early in the third quarter. The weak data was encouraging to investors because the Federal Reserve has made it clear its decision to slow its $85 billion a month in asset purchases, which has been instrumental to Wall Street’s rally, is dependent on strong economic figures. “The numbers were disappointing this morning, but maybe we’ve returned to one of those odd situations where bad news is good for the market in terms of the Fed tapering,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. He said, however, the Fed has focused on job market data which has been strong and the market could still face a stimulus tapering soon. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 19.58 points or 0.13 percent, to 15,030.09, the S&P; 500 gained 3.39 points or 0.2 percent, to 1,666.89 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 14.135 points or 0.39 percent, to 3,671.927. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit its lowest in a week following the data. A recent spike in yields has affected other financial markets as investors grew concerned the steep rise could drive interest rates on mortgages and consumer credit too high and hurt the economy. Amgen Inc struck a deal to buy cancer drug maker Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc for about $10.4 billion on Sunday, sweetening its original offer made in June. Onyx shares rose 5.5 percent to $123.52 and Amgen jumped 7.9 percent to $113.95. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel intended to reach out to his British and French counterparts to discuss the situation in Syria after reports of alleged chemical weapons attacks in Damascus, a senior official said. Hagel said the United States would only take action in concert with the international community and within a legal framework. Washington was all but certain that the government of President Bashar al-Assad had gassed its own people. “The escalation of U.S. involvement in Syria could be a problem for the market,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. “The S&P; 500 is bound to test the 1,635-1,640 level and news out of the Middle East could be the trigger for the market to complete its downward move.” In other deal news, the Pritzker Organization said it will acquire scrap metal broker TMS International Corp for $17.50 a share, a premium of about 12 percent to TMS’s Friday close of $15.57. shares gained 11.7 percent to $17.39.

191,AMGN,UPDATE 3-Amgen seeks to bolster drug pipeline with $10.4 bln Onyx buy,"* Amgen to pay $125 per share for Onyx * Amgen expects deal to add to adjusted earnings in 2015 * Deal gives Amgen pipeline of cancer drugs * Fifth-biggest biotech deal in history By Soyoung Kim and Michael Erman Aug 25 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc struck a deal to buy cancer drug maker Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc for about $10.4 billion on Sunday, as it moves to restock its product pipeline in response to declining sales of its flagship anemia drugs. The acquisition - which ends a two-month-long auction of Onyx - represents the fifth-largest biotechnology deal in history. It gives Amgen full rights to Kyprolis, the new multiple myeloma drug that analysts expect to reach annual peak sales in excess of $2 billion. The world’s largest biotechnology company will also gain a revenue stream from the liver and kidney cancer drug Nexavar that Onyx shares with Bayer AG, as well as royalty payments on Bayer’s much newer colon cancer drug, Stivarga, and potential future royalties on an experimental breast cancer drug being developed by Pfizer Inc. Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen has faced growing pressure to beef up its drug development pipeline as safety concerns have trimmed sales of its flagship anemia drugs, Aranesp and Epogen. Also, patents on four of its five top-selling drugs are set to expire starting in 2015. Cancer medicines are the holy grail for many drugmakers because current products have limited effectiveness and the companies can charge steep prices for new biotech treatments. Amgen said it will pay $125 per share for Onyx, a 4.2 percent increase from the $120 a share it offered in June. Onyx said that bid significantly undervalued the company and put itself up for sale. The companies expect the deal to close in the beginning of the fourth quarter. Amgen expects it to add to adjusted net income in 2015. Discussions between Amgen and Onyx hit a snag earlier this month after Amgen sought access to data from Onyx’s ongoing clinical trials, people familiar with the matter told Reuters previously. A source familiar with the matter on Sunday said that Amgen believed it had done extensive due diligence and was comfortable with the purchase. Onyx shares closed at $116.96 on Friday. They closed at  $85.50 on June 28, before reports of Amgen’s $120-a-share bid surfaced. The Onyx deal is Amgen’s biggest since its $16 billion acquisition of Immunex in 2001 which gave it the rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel, now one of Amgen’s biggest-selling products. It is also by far the biggest deal under CEO Bob Bradway, who assumed the top spot in May 2012. He has done a handful of much smaller deals, the biggest to date being a $1.16 billion acquisition of Micromet. Large pharmaceutical companies have increasingly been looking to acquire smaller biotech firms to gain access to new drugs, as they face significant revenue losses stemming from expired patents. This helped drive up the volume of healthcare M&A; in the first six months of 2013 more than 30 percent compared with the same period last year. Recent deals include generic drugmaker Actavis Inc’s  $8.5 billion acquisition of Warner Chilcott   and Human Genome Sciences’ $3 billion sale to GlaxoSmithKline Plc. The Onyx deal is expected to give Amgen a much higher profile in oncology. Several of its current drugs offer supportive care for cancer patients, such as treating anemia or decreases in white blood cells caused by chemotherapy. Another of Amgen’s newer medicines, Xgeva, helps prevent fractures in patients whose cancer has spread to the bone. Its one product that treats cancer, the colon cancer drug Vectibix, has been largely a disappointment. Analysts expected Onyx revenue to reach $878 million in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with ISI Group LLC, projected that an Onyx acquisition would increase Amgen non-GAAP earnings by 5 percent in 2015, and boost them as much as 15 to 20 percent in 2018. Lazard was the lead financial adviser to Amgen, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch acted as co-adviser and lead arranger for the company’s financing. Centerview Partners was Onyx’s financial adviser Law firms Sullivan & Cromwell and Goodwin Procter were legal counsel to Amgen and Onyx, respectively.",8262013,http://www.reuters.com/article/onyx-amgen/update-3-amgen-seeks-to-bolster-drug-pipeline-with-10-4-bln-onyx-buy-idUSL2N0GQ0JW20130826
192,AMGN,"Amgen, Cytokinetics heart failure drug misses goal in study","AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - An experimental heart failure drug from Amgen and Cytokinetics missed its goal of improving shortness of breath in a mid-stage clinical trial, leaving its future uncertain. Shares in Cytokinetics fell 17 percent in pre-market dealings to $8.66 following the news. Despite the setback in the 613-patient trial using an intravenous formulation of the medicine omecamtiv mecarbil in hospitals, Amgen said it would continue testing an oral version of the drug in a separate Phase II study. The combined results from the tests will determine whether the medicine advances into final Phase III testing or is discontinued. “We are going to look at all the data very, very carefully before making a decision around the future of the molecule,” said Scott Wasserman, Amgen’s executive medical director. Heart failure, in which heart muscle is unable to pump enough blood around the body, is an often deadly disease. About half of people diagnosed with the condition die within five years and treatments have changed little since the 1970s. Omecamtiv mecarbil, which Amgen licensed from Cytokinetics, takes a novel approach to tackling heart failure by activating cardiac myosin, a protein in heart cells that is responsible for converting chemical energy into muscle contraction. The data from the intravenous drug study were unveiled on Tuesday at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Amsterdam, where the difficulty of developing new drugs to treat heart failure has been a major talking point among doctors. Dr. Christopher Granger of Duke University Medical Center, who was not involved in the research, said results from the trial were disappointing, even though there were some encouraging trends towards a favorable response. “I would be discouraged by this in terms of the implications for the drug having an important effect,” he said, noting there had been better results with another product called serelaxin from Novartis. But Dr. Mariell Jessup, president of the American Heart Association and a specialist in heart failure, said it would be premature to dismiss the Amgen drug, noting it was very difficult to show efficacy in a hospital setting. “There is still hope. Even if you can’t show efficacy in the acute setting, as long as there is not an adverse signal I think it is worthwhile studying the oral equivalent,” she said. U.S. biotech giant Amgen has traditionally focused on oncology but more recently has diversified into cardiology, where it is also in a race to develop a new class of cholesterol-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors. In July, it also clinched a deal to secure commercial rights to a drug from French drugmaker Servier for chronic heart failure and angina.

194,AMGN,U.S. drug giant Amgen raises full-year revenue outlook,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), which this month closed a nearly $10 billion acquisition of cancer drug maker Onyx Pharmaceuticals, reported higher-than-expected, third-quarter profit as results were helped by a large U.S. government order for one of its white blood cell boosters. Amgen raised its full-year revenue forecast and pushed up the low end of its earnings forecast range by 5 cents. The company now expects 2013 adjusted earnings of $7.35 to $7.45 per share and sees revenue of $18.3 billion to $18.5 billion, up from its previous view of $17.8 billion to $18.2 billion. The raised revenue view includes expectations of sales in the fourth quarter from Onyx products, including the new multiple myeloma drug Kyprolis, the company said. Kyprolis sales grew a modest 6 percent from the previous quarter to $65 million prior to the closing of the acquisition. The ultimate prospects for the drug are likely to hinge on results of a clinical trial due next year that tests its use earlier in the course of the blood cancer, which could significantly expand use of the medicine. Excluding special items, the company earned $1.94 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations of $1.77, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Without the $155 million government order for Neupogen, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said, “the core business was in line with expectations... “The new products continue to grow and that’s good. And they raised guidance, but because they didn’t raise the (earnings per share) guidance by how much they beat, that would imply a slightly less robust quarter in Q4,” Yee said. Still, Amgen shares rose about 1 percent in after hours trading to $117.50 from their Nasdaq close at $116.21. The world’s largest biotechnology company said on Tuesday net profit rose to $1.37 billion, or $1.79 per share, from $1.1 billion, or $1.41 per share, a year ago. Revenue for the quarter rose 10 percent to $4.74 billion, topping Wall Street estimates of $4.6 billion. Combined sales of Neupogen and Neulasta, used to fight infections by raising white blood cell count, jumped 18 percent to $1.6 billion, exceeding Wall Street estimates of $1.39 billion. Earlier on Tuesday the company announced that it had repurchased the sales rights to the two drugs in several emerging markets from Roche Holding AG ROG.VX. It said sales in those countries last year were about $200 million. Sales of Amgen’s newer products Xgeva, to prevent fractures in cancer that has spread to bones, and the related osteoporosis drug Prolia, continued to see healthy growth. Xgeva sales rose 30 percent to $261 million, in line with analysts’ expectations, while Prolia sales jumped 62 percent to $178 million, somewhat shy of Wall Street estimates of about $187 million. The blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Enbrel, saw sales grow 7 percent to $1.16 billion. Beginning next month, Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) share of Enbrel sales reverts back to Amgen and becomes a 12 percent royalty payment. Amgen said that is expected to add $800 million to operating income in 2014. Amgen said it has fully enrolled patients for the pivotal late stage trials of its high profile cholesterol drug AMG-145, or evolucumab, from a new class of drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors. Results for the drug that will, for the first time, put Amgen into cardiovascular care are due early in 2014. Analysts see the PCSK9 drugs in development as having multibillion-dollar potential. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN.O) in partnership with Sanofi (SASY.PA) and Pfizer are also developing drugs in the class that have shown an ability to dramatically lower “bad” LDL cholesterol. “2014 is going to be more about Kyprolis and PCSK9.

198,AMGN,U.S. FDA says new cholesterol drugs may not need outcome studies,"Nov 14 (Reuters) - Members of an experimental class of cholesterol-lowering drugs could get U.S. regulatory approval based on their ability to  lower “bad” cholesterol, and may not need to show that they reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke, the Food and Drug Administration said on Thursday. The statement eased industry concerns that the agency would require more onerous “outcome” studies before approving the drugs, known as PCSK9 inhibitors. Those concerns emerged earlier this week when two leading U.S. medical organizations recommended that doctors drop their emphasis on specific targets for lowering “bad” LDL cholesterol levels. They also recommended only statin drugs for patients at high risk of heart attack or stroke. Statins, such as AstraZeneca Plc’s Crestor and generic forms of Pfizer Inc’s similarly potent Lipitor (atorvastatin), are the most widely used cholesterol treatments and work by blocking the liver’s production of LDL cholesterol. PCSK9 inhibitors, in late-stage testing at Pfizer, Amgen Inc , and a partnership of Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, are anitibodies designed to block a protein whose natural function is to maintain the presence of LDL in the bloodstream. The companies aim to seek regulatory approval of the PCSK9 drugs on the basis of their ability to lower LDL, not on whether they can reduce heart attack and stroke. The FDA said it is closely monitoring an outcome study of Merck & Co’s widely prescribed cholesterol drug Zetia, which is not a statin. Even though Zetia has been on the market since 2002, Merck has not yet proven that it reduces heart attack risk and stroke. Results from the trial are expected by the second half of next year. Zetia curbs absorption of cholesterol by the intestines. Zetia and Vytorin, a related drug, have combined annual sales of more than $4 billion. Wall Street analysts also expect the PCSK9 inhibitors to generate annual sales in the billions of dollars. The FDA, in an emailed statement, said it will review the PCSK9 inhibitors based on their effects on the entire lipoprotein lipid panel, particularly LDL cholesterol, effects on other markers of potential cardiovascular risk, blood pressure and any evidence of toxicity. “The compound’s overall safety profile will also be factored into this decision,” the agency said.

200,AMGN,Amgen shares slip after analyst cites Kyprolis risks,"(Reuters) - Shares of biotechnology company Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) fell as much as 4 percent on Thursday amid concerns that data at an upcoming medical meeting will not help the competitive profile of its recently acquired blood cancer drug Kyprolis. Kyprolis, approved last year by U.S. regulators as a treatment for advanced multiple myeloma, was acquired as part of Amgen’s nearly $10 billion buyout of Onyx Pharmaceuticals earlier this year. Researchers are scheduled to present data from studies of the Amgen drug, as well as from other blood cancer drugs such as Celgene Corp’s (CELG.O) Pomalyst, in early December at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in New Orleans. In a research note ahead of the conference, Bank of America said Celgene management reported increasing concerns from big myeloma centers about the potential risk of heart problems in patients treated with Kyprolis. Amgen, in an emailed statement, called the research note “misleading.” The BofA note suggested that Kyprolis, for which full FDA approval depends on the outcome of ongoing Phase 3 trials, could be reserved for patients with high-risk myeloma. “In our follow up with Celgene, they acknowledged citing anecdotal reports from high volume multiple myeloma centers of cardiovascular events with Kyprolis, but also clarified that they made no representation of the event rates being any different than what is already included in the Kyprolis label,” Amgen said. To date, the independent monitors overseeing clinical trials of Kyprolis have not reported any specific safety concerns. Amgen said it remains “enthusiastic” about the ongoing studies of Kyprolis and prospects for the drug. Shares of Amgen, which have gained 33 percent over the past 12 months, were down 2.6 percent at $112.58 in late trading on Nasdaq.

201,AMGN,U.S. judge throws out SEC lawsuit over 'suspicious' Onyx trading,"NEW YORK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Two traders have won the dismissal of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit accusing them of insider trading in Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc as the company considered a takeover bid from rival Amgen Inc . The decision by U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken in Manhattan, made public Friday, marked a setback in what has become an increasingly common tactic by the SEC of freezing the accounts of unknown traders engaged in suspicious trading activities. The SEC filed its lawsuit against unknown traders on July 3, targeting three trades between June 26 and 28 that the commission called “suspicious.” Soon afterward, the agency won orders freezing about $4.6 million held in accounts at Citigroup Global Markets Inc and Barclays Capital Inc holding $4.6 million made on the trades. Dhia Jafar and Omar Nabulsi, both of Dubai, stepped out of  anonymity on July 23, saying they made the trades in the Citigroup account. They denied wrongdoing and requested the lawsuit be dismissed. Oetken granted their motion to dismiss, saying the facts alleged by the SEC “are insufficient to support a reasonable inference of insider trading” in advance of news of Amgen’s $10 billion offer. “There is no indication that the SEC knows whether material nonpublic information was tipped, who did the tipping, or who received the tip,” Oetken said. According to the SEC, the trades started the day Onyx’s board of directors voted to reject an unsolicited offer from Amgen. News of Amgen’s offer broke two days later, and Onyx announced the board had rejected the offer on June 30. Almost a month later, Onyx agreed to be bought by Amgen for about $10.4 billion. In his ruling, Oetken said many of the SEC’s allegations were “all belief and no information” and the facts did not support an inference of insider trading. The size and riskiness of the trades also did not support the SEC’s argument, the judge said. And the SEC had not identified anyone who might have been the tipper, Oetken wrote. “Even if there was a tip - which it is not reasonable to infer from these facts alone - the SEC’s allegations do not support a reasonable inference that the tip was in violation of a fiduciary duty, much less that the Defendants knew or should have known about the violation,” Oetken wrote. The judge, however, said he would permit the SEC to file an amended complaint and left a modified freeze order in place for that period. If the SEC does not file an amended complaint within 30 days, Oetkin said he will lift the freeze order. The judge modified the order to cover only $2.53 million in the Citigroup account, the amount Jafar and Nabulsi say they made on the trades at issue. Kevin Callahan, a spokesman for the SEC, said the agency was “pleased the freeze is still in place for 30 days and we’re reviewing the decision.” Patrick Smith, a lawyer who represented Jafar and Nabulsi, said the ruling would make it harder for the SEC to pursue cases if once-unknown traders step forward. “If all the SEC has is the fact of the trade which they argue appears suspicious, they’re not going to have adequate basis to allege insider trading,” he said. “They’re going to need to have something more.” The ruling came in one of several lawsuits the SEC has pursued in recent years seeking asset freezes in cases where it suspects insider trading but cannot immediately identify the individuals responsible. In February, the SEC filed a similar lawsuit to freeze assets after detecting suspicious options trading before an announcement that Berkshire Hathaway Inc and 3G Capital planned to acquire ketchup-maker H.J. Heinz. Last month, two brothers from Brazil, Rodrigo Terpins and Michel Terpins, agreed to pay $5 million to settle that lawsuit. The case is SEC v.

206,AMGN,Amgen cholesterol drug meets goal of 3rd late stage trial,"(Reuters) - A cholesterol fighter developed by Amgen Inc from a highly promising new class of medicines significantly lowered levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol in a late stage trial in patients unable to tolerate statin drugs, the company said on Thursday. The results marked the third successful Phase III test of the drug evolocumab reported by Amgen in recent months - this one in a patient population among the most in need of alternative therapies. An estimated five to 20 percent of heart patients are intolerant of statin medications for lowering cholesterol due to side effects such as muscle weakness or fatigue, Amgen said. Evolocumab belongs to a class of medicine called PCSK9 inhibitors that work by blocking a protein that reduces the liver’s ability to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood. Based on dramatic LDL lowering demonstrated by Amgen and other companies in earlier studies, PCSK9 inhibitors could be the most important new heart drugs to come along in several years with multibillion-dollar sales potential. The injected medicines are likely to be used in high risk heart patients unable to lower their LDL levels sufficiently with high doses of widely used statin drugs, such as Pfizer’s Lipitor, and in those unable to take statins. Many patients remain at high risk of heart attack and stroke “despite the use of all available therapies,” Amgen research and development chief Sean Harper said in a telephone interview. “The ability to treat those individuals with a completely distinct mechanism and see this very large effect size of dropping LDL cholesterol by roughly 50 percent, that’s a pretty big deal for those patients,” Harper said. The company expects during the current quarter to have results of its final two Phase III studies - one in patients already taking high doses of statins and one in patients genetically predisposed to dangerously high cholesterol levels. Amgen will provide details of its latest 307-patient Phase III study, called GAUSS-2, which compared evolocumab to Merck & Co’s Zetia (ezetimibe), at an upcoming medical meeting. However, the world’s largest biotech company said the percentage of cholesterol lowering was consistent with those observed in a similar, smaller Phase II trial. In that study, evolocumab led to 51 percent reduction in LDL levels and 63 percent when combined with Zetia versus a 15 percent reduction seen with Zetia alone. “It’s very unusual to have a therapeutic that addresses one of the underlying factors that drive the greatest mortality risk that exists in Western countries, and increasingly in developing countries - cardiovascular disease driven by atherosclerosis,” Harper said. The company anticipates that some of its global filings seeking approval of the drug will occur this year. “We don’t come across therapeutics like this very often in this industry,” Harper said. “It is very exciting, and as we get each data set our confidence slowly builds that we have the efficacy and the safety profile that will make this an important medicine.” Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, in partnership with Sanofi, is also in Phase III testing of a rival drug. Pfizer is developing its own PCSK9 inhibitor. Amgen shares were down about 0.6 percent at $123.55 on Nasdaq, roughly in line with declines in the broader market.

209,AMGN,Amgen profit tops Street expectations; focus on new drugs,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) on Tuesday reported a quarterly profit that beat Wall Street forecasts, as it gained full control of its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel and saw solid growth in sales of newer products. Amgen, the world’s biggest biotechnology company, also announced another positive result from a late-stage study of its high-profile experimental cholesterol drug, evolocumab. The company issued an initial 2014 earnings forecast range with a midpoint below Wall Street consensus estimates, which could be viewed by investors as either conservative or disappointing. Amgen often adjusts its full-year forecasts over the course of the year. The company said it expects 2014 adjusted earnings of $7.90 to $8.20 per share and revenue of $19.2 billion to $19.6 billion. Analysts on average are looking for $8.18 per share and revenue of $19.57 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The forward guidance was a bit mixed. History shows that the company is typically conservative at the beginning of the year and tries to raise guidance throughout the year,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee. Excluding items, Amgen said it had fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.82 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations of $1.68 a share, according to Thomson Reuters Amgen said its fourth-quarter net profit rose to $1.02 billion, or $1.33 per share, from $788 million, or $1.01 per share, a year ago. Sales of most of Amgen’s main products met or exceeded Wall Street expectations for the quarter. The results included business from Onyx Pharmaceuticals, which Amgen acquired for nearly $10 billion last year. “It was a strong quarter to end the year and it was really due to core products, such as Epogen,” Yee said. Revenue for the quarter rose 13 percent to $5.01 billion, exceeding analysts’ forecasts of $4.81 billion. Epogen, Amgen’s older anemia drug, had a surprisingly strong quarter with sales up 10 percent at $525 million, easily beating Wall Street estimates of about $484 million. Enbrel sales rose 3 percent to $1.2 billion, slightly above analyst expectations. Beginning in November, Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) share of Enbrel sales reverted back to Amgen and became a 12 percent royalty payment. Amgen said it expects the change to add $800 million to operating income in 2014. Amgen said the fourth Phase III clinical trial of its experimental cholesterol fighter evolocumab from a highly promising new class of injectable medicines succeeded in significantly lowering “bad” LDL cholesterol, adding to a wealth of positive results for the medicine that would put the company into heart care for the first time. The company plans this year to begin seeking approvals for the drug intended for people who cannot tolerate widely used statins or who are unable to get their LDL levels low enough despite using high potency statins, such as AstraZeneca’s (AZN.L) Crestor. Amgen expects a steady flow of important clinical data in 2014, including results from a key study of the new multiple myeloma drug Kyprolis that could enable its use earlier in the disease, which should significantly boost sales. Kyprolis, the centerpiece of the Onyx acquisition, had sales of $73 million, up from $65 million in the previous quarter. “We believe Kyprolis has an important role to play as a backbone in treating multiple myeloma,” Amgen Chief Executive Officer Robert Bradway told analysts on a conference call. Xgeva, for preventing fractures after cancer has spread to the bones, saw sales grow 33 percent to $286 million, while sales of the related osteoporosis drug Prolia grew 53 percent from a year ago to $236 million. The drugs also showed nice growth from the third quarter, when sales were $261 million and $178 million, respectively. Combined worldwide sales of the white blood cell boosters Neupogen and Neulasta rose 8 percent to $1.3 billion. Amgen shares fell just under 1 percent to $119.57 in extended trading from a Nasdaq close at $120.70.

Amgen often adjusts its full-year forecasts over the course of the year. The company said it expects 2014 adjusted earnings of $7.90 to $8.20 per share and revenue of $19.2 billion to $19.6 billion. Analysts on average are looking for $8.18 per share and revenue of $19.57 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The forward guidance was a bit mixed. History shows that the company is typically conservative at the beginning of the year and tries to raise guidance throughout the year,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee. Excluding items, Amgen said it had fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.82 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations of $1.68 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Amgen said its fourth-quarter net profit rose to $1.02 billion, or $1.33 per share, from $788 million, or $1.01 per share, a year ago. Sales of most of Amgen’s main products met or exceeded Wall Street expectations for the quarter. The results included business from Onyx Pharmaceuticals, which Amgen acquired for nearly $10 billion last year. “It was a strong quarter to end the year and it was really due to core products, such as Epogen,” Yee said. Revenue for the quarter rose 13 percent to $5.01 billion, exceeding analysts’ forecasts of $4.81 billion. Epogen, Amgen’s older anemia drug, had a surprisingly strong quarter with sales up 10 percent at $525 million, easily beating Wall Street estimates of about $484 million. Enbrel sales rose 3 percent to $1.2 billion, slightly above analyst expectations. Beginning in November, Pfizer Inc’s  share of Enbrel sales reverted back to Amgen and became a 12 percent royalty payment. Amgen said it expects the change to add $800 million to operating income in 2014. Amgen said the fourth Phase III clinical trial of its experimental cholesterol fighter evolocumab from a highly promising new class of injectable medicines succeeded in significantly lowering “bad” LDL cholesterol, adding to a wealth of positive results for the medicine that would put the company into heart care for the first time. The company plans this year to begin seeking approvals for the drug intended for people who cannot tolerate widely used statins or who are unable to get their LDL levels low enough despite using high potency statins, such as AstraZeneca’s  Crestor. Amgen expects a steady flow of important clinical data in 2014, including results from a key study of the new multiple myeloma drug Kyprolis that could enable its use earlier in the disease, which should significantly boost sales. Kyprolis, the centerpiece of the Onyx acquisition, had sales of $73 million, up from $65 million in the previous quarter. “We believe Kyprolis has an important role to play as a backbone in treating multiple myeloma,” Amgen Chief Executive Officer Robert Bradway told analysts on a conference call. Xgeva, for preventing fractures after cancer has spread to the bones, saw sales grow 33 percent to $286 million, while sales of the related osteoporosis drug Prolia grew 53 percent from a year ago to $236 million. The drugs also showed nice growth from the third quarter, when sales were $261 million and $178 million, respectively. Combined worldwide sales of the white blood cell boosters Neupogen and Neulasta rose 8 percent to $1.3 billion. Amgen shares fell just under 1 percent to $119.57 in extended trading from a Nasdaq close at $120.70.",1282014,http://www.reuters.com/article/amgen-results/update-2-amgen-profit-tops-street-expectations-focus-on-new-drugs-idUSL2N0L21SL20140128

212,AMGN,Amgen's cholesterol fighter succeeds in fifth late-stage study,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said its experimental drug from a promising new class of injectable medicines succeeded in treating patients with genetically high cholesterol levels, marking the fifth successful clinical study of the drug. Evolocumab met the main goal of a late-stage trial titled RUTHERFORD-2 by lowering “bad” LDL cholesterol levels when tested against a placebo on 329 patients. Amgen, the world’s biggest biotechnology company, is testing evolocumab widely on a variety of subpopulations. The RUTHERFORD-2 study included patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, an inherited condition that causes high levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol starting at birth. Specifically, patients in the study had heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, which is one of the most common genetic disorders affecting about one out of every 300 to 500 people worldwide, according to Amgen. The company on Tuesday reported positive results from a fourth late-stage study of evolocumab, for which it plans to begin seeking approvals this year. The drug is intended for people who cannot tolerate widely used statins, or who are unable to get their LDL levels low enough despite using high potency statins, such as AstraZeneca’s Crestor.

214,AMGN,"UPDATE 3-Merck results flag, but cancer-drug deals lift shares","By Ransdell Pierson Feb 5 (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc’s quarterly profit and sales just missed expectations as its medicines faced competition from cheaper generics, but the company announced potentially lucrative new cancer-drug partnerships with rival U.S. drugmakers. For the full year, Merck expected to earn $3.35 to $3.53 per share, excluding special items. The average analyst estimate was $3.48 per share. “Overall, I view this guidance as ‘good enough,’ given fairly widespread Street concerns about a ‘mega-miss,’” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said, adding that investors remain more focused on prospects for the company’s array of experimental drugs. Separately on Wednesday, Merck said it plans to test its closely followed immuno-oncology drug MK-3475, in combination with medicines being developed by Pfizer Inc, Amgen Inc  and Incyte Corp. Financial terms of the deals were not disclosed. Merck shares were up 0.3 percent in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after rising as much as 3.1 percent earlier on Wednesday. Schoenebaum said investors were enthused about the planned new studies of MK-3475, a so-called PD-1 inhibitor that works by harnessing the immune system to find and destroy cancer cells. Industry analysts believe the medicine, if approved, could generate annual sales of $2 billion or more and greatly improve treatment of melanoma and potentially other cancers. They also believe such immuno-oncology drugs may have special promise if used in combination with each other. The second-biggest U.S. drugmaker said on Wednesday it earned $781 million, or 26 cents per share, in the fourth quarter. That compared with $908 million, or 30 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, Merck earned 88 cents per share. The average analyst forecast was 89 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 4 percent to $11.32 billion. Wall Street was expecting $11.36 billion. Merck shares rose 22 percent in 2013, underperforming a 27 percent average gain for other large U.S. and European drugmakers, amid waning sales of its Januvia diabetes medicines and uncertainty about its drug pipeline. The company is hoping that MK-3475 and other drugs will be approved and revive sales and earnings growth, following failures or setbacks over the past five years for its treatments for heart disease, osteoporosis and other diseases. Sales of Januvia, Merck’s biggest product, fell 1 percent to $1.12 billion in the fourth quarter, while sales of a related combination medicine called Janumet rose 11 percent to $503 million. Double-digit sales gains were seen for arthritis treatment Remicade and HIV treatment Isentress. But sales of asthma drug, Singulair, now facing generics, tumbled 38 percent to $298 million. Sales of the company’s animal health products, which usually prop up results, slipped 3 percent to $871 million in the quarter. They were hurt by the company’s voluntary suspension of sales earlier in the year of Zilmax, a feed supplement that some critics have alleged caused dangerous weight gains in cattle. Merck said on Wednesday it will study MK-3475 in combination with Pfizer’s approved kidney-cancer drug Inlyta, and separately test MK-3475 against various cancers in combination with a Pfizer immuno-oncology drug called PF-05082566 (PF-2566). The Pfizer drug targets a protein called the human 4-1BB receptor. Incyte and Merck will conduct an early-stage trial of MK-3475 in combination with Incyte’s experimental INCB24360 - a so-called IDO inhibitor. They will be tested on patients with advanced lung cancer, and other advanced cancers. The Merck drug will be tested with Amgen’s experimental  medicine, called talimogene laherparepvec, in an early-stage study of patients with advanced melanoma. The drug, nicknamed “T-VEC,” is a virus that is injected directly into tumor tissue in hopes of stimulating the immune system to attack cancer cells. Shares of Incyte slipped 1.5 percent to $61.97, while Pfizer shares eased 1.3 percent to $30.78.

216,AMGN,Amgen vaccine triggers immune response in advanced melanoma -study,"(Reuters) - An experimental Amgen Inc cancer vaccine used to treat advanced melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, proved effective in a late-stage study in shrinking tumors in a way that suggests the drug triggered the intended systemic immune response, according to data presented on Friday. The vaccine shrank tumors that were directly injected with the drug and tumors around the body that were not injected, according to the data. The drug, talimogene laherparepvec, also known as T-vec, is an engineered virus designed to replicate inside the injected tumor, killing cancer cells there, as well as prime the immune system to attack other cancer cells around body. Dr. Robert Andtbacka, one of the study’s lead investigators, in a telephone interview, called the results “very encouraging.” Amgen last year released initial data from the 295-patient Phase III study showing that T-vec succeeded in demonstrating a significant tumor response that lasted at least six months. The latest data analyzed 4,000 tumor lesions to study the response to the drug in injected versus non-injected tumors. Of the directly injected tumors, 64 percent shrank by at least half, and 47 percent of those had a complete response, meaning the lesion had disappeared, researchers said. Of the uninjected lesions in the skin or lymph nodes, known as non-visceral tumor lesions, 34 percent shrank by at least half with a complete response seen in 21 percent of those. “We also want to see responses in distant lesions that are not injected such as in the liver, in the lung and other places,” Andtbacka explained. Of those so-called visceral tumors on solid organs, 15 percent shrank by at least 50 percent, said Andtbacka, who presented the data at the Society of Surgical Oncology Cancer Symposium in Phoenix. “This indicates to us that we have activation of the immune system to fight these tumors at a distant site,” Andtbacka said. “This is a new generation of oncolytic immunotherapy where you’re seeing very robust responses in injected lesions but also robust responses in non-injected lesions. This bodes well for the future for this product,” added Andtbacka, an associate professor in the division of surgical oncology at the University of Utah School of Medicine. Amgen said it expects to have further data in the first half of this year showing whether T-vec ultimately helped patients in the study to live longer. The company has not yet said when it will apply for approval of the medicine. Andtbacka said he expects the future of the drug will involve its use in combination with other types of cancer immunotherapies, especially in treating patients with non injectable visceral tumors. Amgen is already testing T-vec in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s melanoma drug Yervoy and has agreed to study T-vec in combination with Merck & Co’s experimental immunotherapy from a highly promising class called PD-1 inhibitors. Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. About 132,000 melanoma cases occur globally each year, according to World Health Organization. “We are extremely excited about the data and the potential for combinations with other treatments,” said David Chang, Amgen’s head of global oncology development.

218,AMGN,Amgen drug meets goal for those with high genetic cholesterol,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said its experimental new type of cholesterol-fighting drug met the primary goal of a late-stage trial by slashing “bad” LDL cholesterol levels in patients with a genetic tendency towards high levels of the artery-clogging fat. Amgen said on Monday patients given its injectable drug evolocumab once a month, on top of standard daily statin treatments, showed “clinically meaningful” improvement compared with taking statins alone after 12 weeks of treatment. The drug is also known as AMG-145. The Phase 3 study, called TESLA, involved 49 adult and adolescent patients with a rare condition called homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The condition, seen in about one in a million individuals, can cause a four-fold increase in levels of LDL cholesterol, greatly raising the risk of heart disease. Evolocumab works by blocking PCSK9, a naturally occurring protein that keeps LDL levels elevated in the bloodstream. Other drugmakers, including Pfizer Inc, and a partnership between Regeneron Inc and Sanofi, are racing with Amgen to complete trials of potentially lucrative anti-PCSK9 antibodies. “You could have two or three drugs here, each with upwards of $3 billion to $4 billion in annual sales,” said Richard Purkiss, an analyst with Atlantic Equities. The PCSK9 inhibitors are one of the most closely followed new classes of medicines, Purkiss said, even though they will probably not be prescribed for the average patient with high cholesterol. If approved, “they would be used mainly for very high-risk patients, who have frustratingly high LDL despite statin treatment,” he said. Purkiss said Regeneron and Sanofi had been ahead of the pack in terms of completing clinical trials, but that Amgen’s trials had picked up speed and its drug could be the first to market. In Amgen’s now-completed TESLA study, the safety risk was similar between those taking evolocumab in combination with statins, and those taking statins alone, Amgen said, with the most common adverse events including upper respiratory tract infection, gastrointestinal inflammation and stuffy nose. Data from the trial will be presented at a future medical conference, Amgen said. The world’s largest biotechnology company noted that favorable results have previously been reported in five other Phase III trials of its experimental medicine, which involved different populations. They have included trials among mainstream populations whose high cholesterol is not due to serious genetic causes, as well as trials among those who cannot tolerate statins and instead take a different type of cholesterol fighter called Zetia (ezetimibe) from Merck & Co. In mid-stage studies, evolocumab has cut LDL levels by as much as 60 percent more than with statins alone. Such results have bolstered faith among doctors and industry analysts that the drug and other PCSK9 inhibitors might be a good option for patients who are unable to reach target LDL levels with statins and other standard treatments. Amgen shares were up 1.8 percent in midday trading on the Nasdaq, amid a 1.5 percent gain for the NYSARC Biotech Index.

221,AMGN,Amgen drug lowers cholesterol up to 66 percent in pivotal studies,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amgen Inc’s drug from a high profile new class of experimental medicines lowered “bad” LDL cholesterol by 55 percent to 66 percent compared with a placebo in a trio of late-stage clinical trials, according to data presented on Saturday. Amgen had previously said the drug, evolocumab, met the main goals of five late-stage trials involving some 4,000 patients by significantly outperforming placebo or another cholesterol medicine in a variety of patient populations. Saturday’s presentation at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in Washington marked the first time the magnitude of LDL lowering and other details from the late stage studies were unveiled. Results of the other two Phase III studies will be presented at the meeting on Sunday. The data also showed that two dosing regimens of the injected drug - 140 milligrams every two weeks or 420 mg once a month - were equally effective in reducing LDL levels. “We’re seeing excellent efficacy and the safety profile appears no different than placebo, so you can’t get better than that,” Dr. Michael Koren, one of the lead investigators on two of the evolocumab studies, said in a telephone interview. Evolocumab belongs to a highly promising class of drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors that block a protein that reduces the liver’s ability to remove LDL from the blood. They are expected to be used in patients who cannot tolerate widely used and highly effective statins, such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor, and in those unable to get their cholesterol levels low enough using currently available medicines. “In terms of the LDL lowering, these drugs are as good or better than anything we have,” said Koren, who presented data from the trial called Mendel-2 at the ACC meeting. In that 614-patient study, evolocumab reduced LDL 55-57 percent more than a placebo and up to 40 percent more than Merck & Co’s cholesterol fighter Zetia in patients not on any other cholesterol drugs. It also helped about 70 percent of patients get their LDL down to 70 or lower, Koren said. That had been the target for high risk patients before controversial new guidelines announced last year eliminated specific target numbers. Amgen said it will file its application seeking U.S. approval of evolocumab sometime this year. The drug is expected to compete with similar medicines also in late stages of development from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc in partnership with Sanofi and from Pfizer. Analysts have forecast eventual annual sales of $3 billion or more for each of the drugs, assuming insurers agree to pay for them. Some industry analysts expect them to cost thousands of dollars a year, far above the costs of statins. The companies are conducting large, so-called outcomes studies to prove that the new medicines reduce heart attacks and strokes, as statins have, in addition to dramatically lowering LDL levels. The FDA has indicated that it would not necessarily wait for results from those years-long trials to approve the drugs. Earlier this month, the FDA asked companies developing PCSK9 inhibitors to assess potential cognitive impairment side effects that have been reported with some cholesterol drugs. “I can tell you in Medel-2 there was no (cognitive impairment) signal whatsoever,” said Koren, chief executive of the Jacksonville Center for Clinical Research in Florida. Scott Wasserman, Amgen’s executive medical director for global development, said the same has been true of other evolocumab studies. “We’ve looked at our data very, very carefully and are continuing to look at it very carefully in combination with the FDA. We haven’t seen any (neurocognitive) safety signals,” Wasserman said in a telephone interview. In the study called Descartes, a 52-week trial of 901 patients already on statins or other lipid lowering medicines, evolocumab on average lowered LDL by 57 percent versus placebo. The 329-patient, 12-week Rutherford-2 study tested the Amgen drug in subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic condition involving extreme, dangerously high cholesterol. For those patients, who were already on statins and other lipid lowering therapies, evolocumab took down LDL levels by 59-66 percent compared with placebo. Koren said he expects the first PCSK9 approvals to come for that patient population with additional approvals to follow for those who can’t take statins. “It’s really the most exciting story since statins, no question, and I think that’s pretty universally held in the preventive cardiology community,” Koren said.

The companies are conducting large, so-called outcomes studies to prove that the new medicines reduce heart attacks and strokes, as statins have, in addition to dramatically lowering LDL levels. The FDA has indicated that it would not necessarily wait for results from those years-long trials to approve the drugs. Earlier this month, the FDA asked companies developing PCSK9 inhibitors to assess potential cognitive impairment side effects that have been reported with some cholesterol drugs. “I can tell you in Medel-2 there was no (cognitive impairment) signal whatsoever,” said Koren, chief executive of the Jacksonville Center for Clinical Research in Florida. Scott Wasserman, Amgen’s executive medical director for global development, said the same has been true of other evolocumab studies. “We’ve looked at our data very, very carefully and are  continuing to look at it very carefully in combination with the FDA. We haven’t seen any (neurocognitive) safety signals,” Wasserman said in a telephone interview. In the study called Descartes, a 52-week trial of 901 patients already on statins or other lipid lowering medicines, evolocumab on average lowered LDL by 57 percent versus placebo. The 329-patient, 12-week Rutherford-2 study tested the Amgen drug in subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic condition involving extreme, dangerously high cholesterol. For those patients, who were already on statins and other lipid lowering therapies, evolocumab took down LDL levels by 59-66 percent compared with placebo. Koren said he expects the first PCSK9 approvals to come for that patient population with additional approvals to follow for those who can’t take statins. “It’s really the most exciting story since statins, no question, and I think that’s pretty universally held in the preventive cardiology community,” Koren said.

223,AMGN,Amgen ends marketing agreement with GSK for osteoporosis drug,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said it would end an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline Plc for the marketing of its osteoporosis drug in some regions outside the United States. Amgen said it would take over the marketing of the drug, sold under the brand name Prolia, in most areas under the agreement, including the European Union, Switzerland, Norway, Russia and Mexico, by December 31. GSK will continue to market the drug in Australia, Amgen said in a regulatory filing. (link.reuters.com/cax28v) “GSK and Amgen have reached a mutual agreement to end their existing agreement...,” a GSK spokesman said in an emailed statement, adding, “This new arrangement will allow GSK to increase focus on executing important new product launches over the next few years.” Amgen said it would pay GSK $275 million over the rest of the year and reimburse the British drugmaker $15 million for costs incurred during the transition period. Prolia generated worldwide sales of $744 million in 2013, a 58 percent increase from a year earlier. (link.reuters.com/mux28v) According to the agreement signed in July 2009, Amgen retained the rights to market the drug in the United States and Canada as a treatment for osteoporosis and other conditions and as a treatment for cancer in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico. Amgen also said on Thursday that GSK would continue to market the drug as a treatment for conditions other than osteoporosis in countries such as China, Brazil, India and South Korea. GSK holds the marketing rights in these regions until 2024, according to Amgen’s annual report. Amgen is developing the drug in late-stage studies as a treatment for other forms of osteoporosis, including glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and male osteoporosis. The company is also testing the drug, denosumab, as a treatment for cancer-related bone damage. Denosumab is sold under the brand name Prolia as a treatment for three conditions, including postmenopausal osteoporosis in women at high risk of fracture. The drug is approved in the United States as a treatment for giant cell tumor of the bone and is sold under the brand name Xgeva.

226,AMGN,Amgen melanoma drug fails to improve overall survival rates,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said its experimental drug to treat a deadly form of skin cancer did not significantly improve overall survival rates in patients enrolled in a late-stage study. The company said the drug met the study’s main goal of shrinking tumors, as it had previously reported, but did not meet the secondary goal of improving overall survival in patients with melanoma. The most common serious adverse events observed in the trial include disease progression, a bacterial skin infection and fever, the company said. ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said the drug’s failure to significantly improve survival rates could affect its chances for approval and limit its commercial opportunity as a single therapy. Amgen said in June that data from the pivotal study showed that the drug improved survival by 21 percent for patients with advanced forms of melanoma compared with a standard white blood cell-boosting drug. The company first reported in March last year that the drug, talimogene laherparepvec, met the study’s main goal of inducing a durable response rate (DRR) — defined as a complete or partial tumor shrinkage lasting at least six months — in 16 percent of patients. Also known as T-Vec, the drug is injected directly into a tumor and is designed to replicate until the cancer cells rupture. It then activates the body’s immune response to fight cancer cells that have spread to other areas. Amgen is also testing the drug in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s melanoma drug Yervoy. Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States, but melanoma, which begins in skin cells that make the pigment melanin, accounts for less than 2 percent of skin-cancer cases. The American Cancer Society estimates that 76,100 new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed this year, and that the disease will kill about 9,710 patients. The company’s shares were little changed at $122.20 in morning trading on the Nasdaq on Friday. They closed at $124.13 on Thursday.

227,AMGN,Amgen profit falls on inventory draw downs; sales disappoint,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) on Tuesday reported lower-than-expected first quarter profit as sales of several key products fell short of Wall Street estimates, with its big-selling rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel particularly hard hit by inventory stocking by wholesalers late last year. The company left its full year forecast unchanged, disappointing some investors who have become accustomed to Amgen raising its outlook as the year progresses, and its shares fell nearly 3 percent in extended trading. Amgen still expects 2014 adjusted earnings of $7.90 to $8.20 per share and revenue $19.2 billion to $19.6 billion. Wall Street on average is looking for earnings of $8.16 per share and sales of $19.61 billion. “We are confident that we can meet our full year revenue guidance,” Chief Executive Robert Bradway said on a conference call with analysts and investors. The world’s largest biotechnology company said net profit fell to $1.07 billion, or $1.40 per share, compared with a profit of $1.43 billion, or $1.88 per share, a year ago, when earnings were helped by a tax gain. Excluding special items, Amgen had adjusted earnings of $1.87 per share, missing analysts’ average expectations by 7 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “This quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Amgen,” said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt. “Given this is all about wholesaler inventory changes, they were able to reiterate the guidance for the year, so we still think that things are on track, but Q1 does tend to be a tough period.” The results were also impacted by increased research and development spending and higher acquisition-related expenses. Amgen said it still expects to begin filing for global approvals of its high profile new type of cholesterol fighter, evolocumab, this year. The drug is seen as a potentially important future growth driver as Amgen enters the arena of heart care. Revenue for the quarter rose 7 percent to $4.52 billion, but fell short of Wall Street estimates of $4.76 billion. The company generated $1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, an increase of 9 percent. Product sales, while up from a year ago, declined 9 percent from the previous quarter, which the company said was primarily due to inventory stocking late in 2013 ahead of potential 2014 price increases. First quarter demand for Enbrel was hit by the draw down of inventory sold in the fourth quarter of last year, Amgen said. Enbrel sales fell 5 percent to $988 million. Analysts had been estimating sales of about $1.1 billion for the quarter. Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said disappointing Enbrel sales “may be an indication that Enbrel is starting to suffer from too much competition.” Inventory drawdowns hurt sales of other products as well, Amgen said. Some of Amgen’s more important newer products also came in below Wall Street estimates. Sales of the new multiple myeloma drug, Kyprolis, the centerpiece of Amgen’s nearly $10 billion acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals last year, were $68 million. That was down from the previous quarter’s $73 million and well below analysts’ expectations of about $82 million. The company is expecting important clinical data later this year on Kyprolis that could help spark sales if it leads to a wider approval that would allow for the drug’s use early in treatment of the disease rather than only after multiple prior medicines have been used. “What really matters for this drug going forward is whether they are able to dramatically expand the label and get into earlier lines of therapy. That will all be data driven,” Cowen’s Schmidt said. Sales of Xgeva, to prevent fractures when cancer has spread to the bones, rose 25 percent to $279 million, below Wall Street estimates of about $292 million. The related osteoporosis drug Prolia saw sales jump 38 percent to $196 million, but that still missed analysts’ estimates of about $209 million. The company’s white blood cell boosters Neulasta and Neupogen had combined worldwide sales of $1.38 billion, roughly in line with Wall Street expectations. Amgen shares fell to $116 in after hours trading from a Nasdaq close at $119.30.

233,AMGN,Pfizer may have to pay more cash and top $105 bln to win AstraZeneca,"* Initial 30 pct cash component too low for AZ investors * Pfizer may give more cash but limited by UK domicile move * “White knights” thin on ground, Amgen said not interested By Ben Hirschler and Simon Jessop LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer  will need to raise its bid for AstraZeneca to around $105-110 billion and increase the proportion of cash in the offer to win its British rival, investors believe. After showing his hand and pressuring his smaller competitor on Monday by disclosing two bid approaches, both of which were rebuffed, Pfizer CEO Ian Read has until May 26 to “put up or shut up” under UK takeover rules. Importantly, after a jump in Pfizer shares, Read knows he has the backing of many of his own shareholders, while the threat of a counterbid does not appear imminent. Read and his team will be using the time available to consider how they can sweeten an offer made in January worth 58.8 billion pounds ($98.8 billion), or 46.61 pounds a share, comprising 30 percent cash and 70 percent shares. AstraZeneca said that offer fell “very significantly” short and it specifically flagged the small cash component, which would leave investors exposed to the risks faced by Pfizer in executing an ambitious mega-merger. So far, the British group has refused to talk to Pfizer - but it has not ruled out discussions altogether and one person close to the company said the cash component of any fresh offer would be key in determining if there was engagement in future. Cash is uppermost in the minds of AstraZeneca shareholders, too. “For it to move forward from here, they (Pfizer) need to find a way of getting Astra management engaged and that feels like it needs a specific value being applied to the group, and it needs the cash element to be higher,” said Alastair Gunn of Jupiter Fund Management, which is a top-20 investor in AstraZeneca. Analysts at Jefferies believe a deal could get done with Pfizer offering a 50/50 split between cash and shares at a price of at least 50 pounds a share. Several investors contacted by Reuters confirmed they were looking for 50 pounds a share or more, with Neil Veitch of SVM Asset Management predicting an agreed deal somewhere between 52 and 53 pounds. Because a key goal of the planned takeover is to get the tax advantages of re-domiciling the enlarged group in Britain, there is a limit to how much cash Pfizer can offer, since at least 20 percent of its shareholders are required to be UK-based. “We estimate Pfizer will need to issue a minimum of around $55 billion in shares to comfortably meet this requirement,” Jefferies said. Based on the original 30 percent cash element, Moody’s analyst Michael Levesque said Pfizer could fund the whole of the cash portion with offshore funds. Pushing the cash element to 50 percent, however, would require taking on some incremental debt. AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot, whose efforts to revive the firm’s drug pipeline have proved a key draw for Pfizer, will now be canvassing the views of shareholders as a “priority”, with machinery in place for meetings with big and small investors, two people close to the company said. Soriot and chairman Leif Johansson will also be weighing strategic alternatives for the drugmaker, including the potential spin-off of non-core therapy areas like infection and neuroscience, as well as possible acquisitions. But “white knight” counterbidders ready to take on Pfizer are likely to be thin on the ground - not least because few other companies would enjoy the same cost and tax benefits from acquiring AstraZeneca as Pfizer. Amgen is one player for whom an AstraZeneca deal might make sense, since the two companies are co-developing a number of drugs, but a person familiar with the U.S. biotech firm said on Tuesday it was not interested in entering the fray. French drugmaker Sanofi is another company with the heft and M&A; experience to consider intervening, yet its CEO Chris Viehbacher said on Tuesday he planned to stick to smaller bolt-on acquisitions. GlaxoSmithKline, the British company with arguably the greatest potential to extract synergies from buying AstraZeneca, has meanwhile said for several years it is not interested in large deals.

234,AMGN,Fitch Rates Amgen's Unsecured Debt Issuance 'BBB',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a ‘BBB’ rating to Amgen  Inc.’s (Amgen) proposed $4.5 billion unsecured notes offering. Fitch expects  Amgen to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding  the repayment of preferred shares under its Master Repurchase Agreement or  outstanding term loan borrowings, and pre-funding a portion of its outstanding  1.875% unsecured notes and 4.85% unsecured notes maturing in November 2014. A  full list of ratings is listed at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS —Debt leverage increased significantly because of the Onyx acquisition; —The acquisition of Onyx was strategically sound and it will likely mitigate  Amgen’s patent expiry risks; —Fitch anticipates Amgen will refrain from share repurchases in the  intermediate term to preserve U.S. cash balances; —Fitch forecasts strong free cash flow (FCF), although significant cash  balances are expected to be held outside the U.S. Leverage Increased from Onyx Acquisition Debt leverage rose from incremental debt required to consummate the purchase of  Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Onyx) for approximately $9.7 billion (net of Onyx  cash balances) in October 2013. Total debt leverage was 4.2x for the latest  12-month (LTM) period ending March 31, 2014. Fitch expects the level to remain  above 3.0x through 2015-2016, leaving the company little flexibility within its  ‘BBB’ rating category. However, the company should deleverage during the  forecast period primarily through growth in EBITDA, with possibly some modest  debt reduction.          Long-Term Revenue Growth Supported by Onyx Fitch sees sales from Onyx’s three marketed pharmaceuticals - Nexavar, Stivarga,  and Kyprolis - helping to mitigate pressure from expiring drug patents, notably  in 2015, when two of Amgen’s top-5 selling drugs, Neupogen and Neulasta, could  face generic competition. Coupled with continued solid uptake of the promising  medicines, Xgeva and Prolia, Fitch anticipates compound annual growth of 3.2% in  2012 to 2017. Revenues generated by the Onyx portfolio, notably Kyprolis, add  nearly 2% to the CAGR during this period.  Biosimilar Risks Significant, But Less Than Traditional Generic Drugs As mentioned above, Fitch expects to see competing biological drugs in the U.S.  to two top-5 selling drugs - Neupogen and Neulasta - over the next three years  including a first-generation filgrastim treatment, Granix, introduced by Teva  Pharmaceutical Industries in November 2013. However, new competition to Amgen’s  biological therapies, biosimilars, will not benefit from interchangeability upon  launch, limiting their inroads into the marketplace. Moreover, the number of  potential drugmakers may be modest given the high cost to develop and market  biosimilar pharmaceuticals. As such, Fitch anticipates revenue declines from  patent expirations at around 20% to 30% as opposed to the 80% to 90% typically  seen with patent lapses of small-molecule drugs. Share Repurchases Paused, Dividends to Rise Given the higher debt burden following the Onyx acquisition, Fitch expects share  repurchases will be on hold through 2015. Amgen currently has no plans to make  any significant repurchases during 2014 and 2015. The focus of shareholder  returns during this period will turn to dividends, forecasted to increase  annually during the intermediate term. Amgen’s board increased the annual rate  of dividends 30% to $2.44 per share in 2014 from $1.88 per share in 2013, which  will result in payments of $1.9 billion this year.  Strong Free Cash Flow Sustained, U.S. Cash Balances Limited Amgen has maintained significant free cash flow (FCF) generation annually since  2005, and FCF was $4.2 billion for the LTM period ending March 31, 2014,  representing a margin of 21.9%. Fitch anticipates steady and strong annual FCF  (at least $4 billion), despite higher dividend and interest payments. As a  result, Fitch expects FCF margins of 20% to 25% through 2015.  Amgen had cash (including restricted cash) and short-term investments of $23.2  billion at March 31, 2014, the majority of which resides outside of the U.S.  Fitch believes that Amgen will continue to struggle with diminishing U.S. cash  balances due to capital demands for shareholder-friendly actions. At March 31,  2014, the company had full capacity under a $2.5 billion credit facility  maturing December 2016, which provides added liquidity. Fitch believes Amgen  will maintain adequate access to the credit markets to refinance coming debt  maturities, including $2 billion of debt that matures in 2014. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch expects Amgen will reduce debt leverage that increased as a result of the  Onyx acquisition by roughly 0.5x per year through 2015. A material deviation  from this pace of deleveraging would likely result in a downgrade. Such a  scenario could result from leveraging acquisitions, debt-financed share  repurchases or operational stress that decreases profitability.  No positive rating momentum is seen for the near term if the acquisition is  executed. A positive revision of the Rating Outlook to Stable would depend upon  Fitch's belief that the company will sustainably operate with total debt  leverage of roughly 2.5x to 3.0x. A decrease to this leverage range will require  strong operational performance (including solid FCF generation) coupled with  relatively stable debt levels.  Amgen's current ratings are: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR)'BBB'; --Senior unsecured debt 'BBB'; --Bank loan 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'. The ratings apply to approximately $32 billion of debt at March 31, 2014.

235,AMGN,Qiagen wins U.S. approval for test to accompany Amgen cancer drug,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Friday approved Qiagen NV’s gene-testing kit to identify those colorectal cancer patients most likely to benefit from Amgen Inc’s drug, Vectibix, Qiagen said. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration expanded the approval of Vectibix to allow its use as a first-line, or initial, treatment for colon cancer in combination with the widely used FOLFOX chemotherapy regimen, Amgen said. The expanded Vectibix approval is for patients who have a non-mutated, or wild type, KRAS gene after clinical trials demonstrated that those patients were most likely to be helped by the drug. The FDA approval for the genetic test marks the third U.S. approval for a Qiagen companion diagnostic for use in combination with a specific drug, a key growth market for the German company.     Both approvals could pave the way for increased use of Vectibix, which has been largely a disappointment for Amgen. It means the drug can be used earlier in the disease and would be accompanied by a standarushdized diagnostic to help doctors  pinpoint patients that would best respond to the medicine. Amgen had $389 million in sales from Vectibix last year, $126 million of which came from U.S. sales. Close to 40 percent of colorectal cancer patients have tumors with mutated forms of the KRAS gene, which make them poor candidates for Vectibix. The rest have the non-mutated, or wild, forms and stand a better chance of benefiting from the drug, which was approved in the United States in 2006.

237,AMGN,"CORRECTED-INSIGHT-RPT-Insurers scrutinize drug costs after $84,000 Sovaldi surprise","(Corrects to Reimbursement Intelligence from Intelligence Reimbursement, to Whang as co-president from president, to Steve Miller from Stuart Miller) By Caroline Humer and Deena Beasley NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES, May 28 (Reuters) - Shocked by the rapid adoption of a new $84,000 hepatitis C treatment, U.S. health insurers are trying to make sure they aren’t blindsided by other drugs being developed and are looking for ways to limit their use from the day they are launched. Manufacturer Gilead Sciences Inc says 30,000 people have received hepatitis drug Sovaldi so far, and that sales hit a record-breaking $2.3 billion within a few months. The treatment, typically 84 pills taken over 12 weeks, completely cures the disease in more than 90 percent of patients. As many as 3.2 million Americans are infected by hepatitis C, and the cost of giving most of them Sovaldi would surpass $200 billion. Some insurers have already put conditions on who can get the drug, and states including California and Texas have slowed or put treatment on hold while they study what to do. Insurers warned that these unforeseen costs will cut 2014 earnings and require rate hikes. Now, at industry conferences, in conversations with investors, and in private, they are pushing Gilead’s rivals, a group that includes AbbVie Inc , Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co , to discount their own new hepatitis C treatments when they come to market starting this fall. Such a high-profile campaign by insurers before drugs are even approved is new. They are also signaling they will restrict who can get coverage for new cholesterol drugs being developed by Amgen Inc , Pfizer Inc and a partnership of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA. By law, insurers cannot deny access to new drugs if they represent a real improvement for patients, leaving drug companies with the upper hand in most price discussions. When comparable competitors, or a generic version is on the market about a decade later, insurers have room to steer patients away from the new drugs, and pharmaceutical companies cut prices steeply and give big discounts. But insurers have not faced such a highly effective drug aimed at a widespread disease that is so expensive and so quickly adopted. The previous record for a drug reaching blockbuster status was set in 2011, when hepatitis C therapy Incivek from Vertex Pharmaceuticals raked in $1.56 billion for the entire year. Sovaldi has sold more in a quarter of the time. As a result, insurers are taking a harder line on which patients should get Sovaldi, based on the drug’s clinical data. Sovaldi is “game-changing” for insurers’ thinking, said John Whang, co-president of Reimbursement Intelligence, a consulting firm that helps pharmaceutical companies set prices. The only way for them to respond is to control the volume of treatment used, he said. In a sign of how serious the industry has become, the largest insurer lobby group last week took Gilead to task at a public conference. “The company in this case is asking for a blank check and you can’t give anyone anymore a blank check because it will blow up family budgets, state Medicaid budgets, employer costs and wreak havoc on the federal debt,” said Karen Ignagni, president of America’s Health Insurance Plans. Gilead argues that Sovaldi’s price is worth it, since it will replace even costlier spending on hospital visits and treatments for cirrhosis or liver failure. It has not budged on price for the hepatitis C drug, although Gregg Alton, Gilead’s executive vice president for corporate and medical affairs, acknowledged that insurers are going to start negotiating. U.S. drug spending reached a record $329 billion in 2013, driven by a double-digit increase in prices for new cancer, HIV and hepatitis C therapies. Express Scripts, the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, expects spending on such specialty drugs to rise an additional 63 percent from 2014 to 2016, driven by an 1,800 percent increase in hepatitis C drug costs. Successful drugs can cost $1 billion to bring to market, including spending on research, development and marketing. Supporters of drug companies say big advances necessitate high prices. “We are the only country in the world that pays exorbitant prices to provide innovation first here, but that’s what we need and that’s what the American people have come to expect,” said Richard Burr, a Republican Senator from North Carolina who has spent decades working on bipartisan health bills. Hepatitis C complications can take years to develop, which gives insurers and government health agencies leeway to determine when treatment should start. Many insurers, which manage most of the 150 million people covered by employer-based plans as well as some government Medicare and Medicaid plans, require patients to get authorization before using Sovaldi. Some limit the drug to patients with a certain genetic type of the disease. Express Scripts has been pushing for all but the sickest patients to wait for new therapies that are expected to compete head-to-head with Sovaldi late this year. It is also pressing rival manufacturers for low prices, hoping to avoid the shock of Sovaldi, which sped through trials and regulatory approval and caught insurers by surprise. “In this particular case there was very little discussion pre-launch. But other companies are now already discussing potential future price points in response,” said Steve Miller, Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer. AbbVie and Merck both declined to comment on whether discussions with insurers about their new drugs were underway. Gilead, which says it discussed the Sovaldi launch with insurers, is in talks over which patients should be treated with its next hepatitis C pill. That will be a two-drug combination that will eliminate the need for a companion drug that nearly doubles Sovaldi’s current total cost. Industry analysts expect the company will price it closer to Sovaldi’s $84,000 than to the $150,000 cost of a combination of Sovaldi and a Johnson & Johnson drug that some doctors prescribe. Mick Kolassa, chairman of pricing consultancy Medical Marketing Economics, in Oxford, Mississippi, who advises pharma companies, says insurers are being aggressive. “We are seeing some of them step up and flex their muscles,” he said. More scrutiny of new pricing is likely ahead as the country comes to terms with how it should pay for expensive drugs, according to John Castellani, Chief Executive Officer of leading drug industry lobby group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America or PhRMA. Sovaldi has shown that patients are bearing too much of the drug’s costs because of rising co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles, he told Reuters, laying the blame on factors controlled by insurance companies. But patient advocates are not choosing sides yet, which may have the effect of giving insurers room for action. “I think the fault lies with both the for-profit insurers and the drug companies,” said Anne Donnelly, director of healthcare policy at the San Francisco-based Project Inform, which advocates for hepatitis C patients. The system has not changed to reflect the impact of new effective, expensive drugs, she said. The next big price battle centers on a new class of cholesterol drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors, which help the liver to clear “bad” LDL cholesterol from the blood. Large-scale studies show the new drugs can help patients who cannot tolerate, or get enough benefit from, the most widely-used cholesterol drugs, statins. The PCSK9 therapies are expected to cost thousands of dollars a year, far above the price of statins sold as generics. Drugmakers are expected to push for the new medicines to be used by 7 million to 20 million people, or up to 30 percent of the 71 million Americans with high cholesterol. Insurers already are questioning whether the estimates of use are legitimate. “There is really no need to take these new medications and spread them out across a larger community of people who will respond to existing treatments, many of which are generic,” Aetna Inc’s National Medical Director for Pharmacy Policy Ed Pezalla said in an interview.

239,AMGN,Amgen names former 3M CFO Meline as finance chief,"June 9 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc, the world’s largest biotechnology company, on Monday named manufacturing and auto industry veteran David Meline as chief financial officer. Meline, 56, had been CFO of diversified manufacturer 3M Co . He replaces Michael Kelly, who has been acting CFO since January, when Jonathan Peacock left the post. Earlier on Monday, 3M said Meline was stepping down to become CFO “with another large publicly traded company.” Prior to 3M, Meline spent more than 20 years with General Motors, rising to the post of CFO for GM’s North America operations. In moving from manufacturing to biotechnology, Meline will oversee a company with a market value of about $89 billion and  2013 revenue of $18.7 billion. 3M has a market valuation of almost $95 billion. “David’s leadership talent and broad international experience will be invaluable to Amgen as we execute our strategy for long-term growth and bring our pipeline of medicines toward commercialization in a number of new markets,” Amgen Chief Executive Officer Robert Bradway said in a statement.

240,AMGN,Amgen psoriatic arthritis drug maintains efficacy after 1 yr -study,"June 11 (Reuters) - A drug being developed by Amgen Inc  for psoriatic arthritis demonstrated sustained effectiveness after a year of treatment with no new safety concerns, according to data from a midstage trial. Amgen and partner AstraZeneca Plc had previously presented 12-week data from the 168-patient trial of the biotech drug, brodalumab, showing it to be significantly more effective than a placebo. After 12 weeks, all patients - those who received 140 milligrams of brodalumab every two weeks, those who got the 280-mg dose and the placebo group - were given the high dose over the next 40 weeks with significant disease improvement seen. At 52 weeks, 71 percent of patients who originally received the 140-mg dose had achieved the study’s main goal known as ACR20 - a measure of at least 20 percent improvement in signs and symptoms of the painful condition, such as tender and swollen joints. Among those who got 280 mg from the start, 56 percent were at ACR20 after a year, as was 50 percent of the original placebo group. After 12 weeks, 37 percent of the low-dose group and 39 percent on the high dose had achieved ACR20 versus 18 percent for placebo. ACR50, a 50 percent improvement in disease signs and symptoms, was achieved by 47 percent of the original 140-mg patients and 27 percent of the original 280-mg patients at a year, while ACR70 was achieved by 22 percent and 7 percent, respectively. For placebo patients who switched to 280 mg, the ACR50 rate was 38 percent and ACR70, 14 percent. “From an efficacy point of view the drug worked,” Dr. Philip Mease, the study’s lead researcher who will present the data at the European League Against Rheumatism meeting in Paris on Saturday, said in a telephone interview. The results were also published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday. Brodalumab belongs to a class of drugs called IL-17 inhibitors that work by blocking a signaling pathway that plays a key role in inducing and promoting inflammatory diseases. Research firm ISI Group has forecast eventual annual peak sales for the drug of about $2 billion. Patients in the study had moderate to severe versions of the   inflammatory disease related to the skin condition psoriasis, for which the drug is also being tested. They had already failed at least one therapy, including about half who were no longer being helped by injectable biologic medicines known as anti-TNF drugs, such as AbbVie Inc’s top-selling Humira and Amgen’s Enbrel. “It’s hopeful that this (anti-IL-17) mechanism is central enough that they’re going to have responses despite the failure of anti-TNF therapy,” Mease said. Doctors are looking for new treatments for psoriatic arthritis and related diseases as effectiveness of even the powerful anti-TNF drugs tends to diminish over time. There were four cases of serious adverse events reported, including one serious infection and one patient hospitalized with abdominal pain, but no deaths.

244,AMGN,"Amgen growth in Brazil picks up, eyes doubling portfolio by 2020","SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Amgen Inc, the world’s biggest biotechnology company, has had a surge in sales in Brazil this year and it plans to double its drug portfolio in the country by the end of the decade, the company’s top local executive says. Eduardo Santos, head of Amgen Brasil, said in a recent interview that revenue rose 54 percent from a year earlier in the first half of 2014, more than double the company’s average annual growth in Brazil since it arrived three years ago. Citing competitive concerns, he declined to say how much Brazil contributed to Amgen’s $18.7 billion revenue in 2013, but he said the unit has reached financial self-sufficiency.     The release of three patented Amgen drugs in Brazil this year boosted sales and helped expand the drugmaker’s local business beyond its unpatented medicines, which will face rising competition in coming years. Brazil’s aging population and rapidly growing access to private healthcare have sparked growth of a market for innovative and expensive pharmaceuticals of the kind Amgen develops to treat cancer, kidney failure and other diseases. In the interview at Amgen’s offices in Sao Paulo, Santos said an ongoing slump in Latin America’s largest economy has put some pressure on government budgets, but it will do little to reduce demand for Amgen’s medicines.”The market for new cars may contract, but our patients’ diagnoses will remain.” He added that the company’s challenge is stronger competition, not weaker demand. Four Brazilian drugmakers - EMS, Ache, Uniao Quimica and Hypermarcas SA - are investing about 500 million reais ($225 million) to open a new biopharmaceutical plant by 2016. By producing biologically developed treatments rather than purely synthetic drugs, the Brazilian rivals will pressure prices in Amgen’s niche just as they have for generic medicines. Amgen plans to double its patented drug portfolio in Brazil from five to as many as 10 medicines by 2020, Santos said, but the company sees no need to expand with more local acquisitions after its $215 million purchase of drugmaker Bergamo in 2011. “Given our profile, there’s not many businesses we could buy here,” he said. “Our idea is not to participate in any consolidation.” He said the idea of Amgen opening a new plant in Brazil is also “a question mark for now,” but that the company continues to invest in local tests for drugs it is developing. Some 2,500 patients are participating in Amgen clinical trials at more than 200 Brazilian research centers, he said.

High on the list of potential growth drivers is evolocumab, a cholesterol-lowering medicine from a new class of drugs that analysts see having multibillion-dollar sales potential. The company said it plans to file applications seeking U.S. and European approval this quarter. It has already filed for U.S. approval of new drugs to treat heart failure and advanced melanoma and expects important data on other medicines this year. “That gives us the potential for several high potential new product launches in 2015,” Chief Executive Robert Bradway said on a conference call.   Amgen’s second-quarter profit sailed past Wall Street expectations after a disappointing first quarter, and the company significantly raised its full-year earnings forecast. Its shares rose more than 4 percent to $129.  Amgen now expects 2014 adjusted earnings of $8.20 to $8.40 per share, up from its prior view of $7.90 to $8.20 per share.

248,AMGN,"Sanofi, Regeneron drug cuts cholesterol in nine late-stage trials","* Sanofi to file drug for US and EU approval by year-end * Nine Phase III ODYSSEY trials meet primary endpoint * Alirocumab “generally well tolerated” in trials By Natalie Huet PARIS, July 30 (Reuters) - A new drug being developed by French drugmaker Sanofi and U.S. partner Regeneron  cut “bad” LDL cholesterol more than placebo and existing treatments in nine late-stage clinical trials, the companies said on Wednesday. The injectable drug, called alirocumab, is from a promising new class of medicines, called PCSK9 inhibitors, also being developed by Amgen Inc and other drugmakers. If approved, these drugs could reap annual sales of $3 billion or more, according to some industry analysts. The Phase III ODYSSEY trials showed that after 24 weeks, the mean percentage reduction in LDL cholesterol with alirocumab was consistent with results seen in previous trials, the companies said in a statement. The trials involved patients whose high LDL cholesterol levels are not sufficiently controlled by existing treatments such as statins, who cannot tolerate these or who present a high or very high cardiovascular risk. “The robust data from these studies in more than 5,000 patients is the basis of our global regulatory submissions, which we expect in the U.S. and EU by year-end,” said Sanofi R&D; chief Elias Zerhouni. PCSK9 inhibitors block a protein that prevents the body from eliminating LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream and offer a new way of fighting the build-up of artery-clogging fat that puts patients at risk of heart attacks. These drugs are mainly aimed at the millions of people who either cannot tolerate statins such as Pfizer Inc’s  Lipitor or AstraZeneca Plc’s Crestor or who cannot get their cholesterol levels under control with statins alone. In earlier mid-stage studies, when combined with statins, alirocumab and Amgen’s own PCSK9 drug cut levels of LDL cholesterol by close to 70 percent, more than statins alone. The drug was “generally well tolerated” in the trials, with most common adverse events being nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections and injection site reactions. Serious adverse events and deaths were “generally balanced” between treatment groups as were musculoskeletal, neurocognitive and liver-related events, the companies added. An interim safety analysis showed that after 18 months of treatment, patients on alirocumab were less prone to cardiovascular events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and unstable angina requiring hospitalization) compared with those on placebo. Alirocumab’s potential to cut cardiovascular risk is being assessed in an ongoing 18,000-patient long-term outcomes trial.

249,AMGN,Amgen blood cancer drug succeeds in late-stage study,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said a late-stage study found that its blood cancer drug helped patients live significantly longer without the disease worsening, compared with standard treatment. The world’s largest biotechnology company’s shares rose as much as 4.3 percent to $131.00 in premarket trading, after it released interim data for its injectable drug, Kyprolis. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in 2012, granted the drug accelerated approval for use in multiple myeloma, the second most common form of blood cancer. Accelerated approval is granted to drugs for serious diseases with little or no treatment options, based on data from initial trials. However, manufacturers still need to conduct larger trials to bolster initial findings. The trial tested Kyprolis in combination with two other treatments, against those two treatments alone, in 792 patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who have received prior therapy. Patients treated with Kyprolis lived for a median of 26.3 months without disease progression, compared with 17.6 months for those not given the drug, Amgen said. The data may support the conversion of accelerated approval to full approval and help the company expand the current indication in the United States, Amgen said. Amgen shares were up 3.14 percent at $129.50 in premarket trading on the Nasdaq on Monday. Kyprolis, the centerpiece of Amgen’s nearly $10 billion acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals last year, had sales of $68 million in the first quarter.

250,AMGN,UPDATE 2-Amgen blood cancer drug succeeds in late-stage study,"(Adds upcoming data, analyst comment, share move) By Bill Berkrot Aug 4 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc said on Monday its Kyprolis combined with standard treatment helped patients with relapsed multiple myeloma live significantly longer before their blood cancer worsened, compared with the standard therapy, according to interim data from an eagerly-anticipated late stage study. Kyprolis, the centerpiece of Amgen’s nearly $10 billion acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals last year, has recorded sales of $146 million in the first half of this year. Celgene Corp’s rival multiple myeloma drug Pomalyst by comparison had sales of $296.5 million over the first six months. Analysts have said positive results from the study announced on Monday and another Phase III trial called Focus, testing the blood cancer drug as an initial multiple myeloma treatment, were critical to help jumpstart Kyprolis sales growth. In the trial called Aspire of 792 patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who had undergone prior therapy, those who received Kyprolis plus Celgene’s older Revlimid and the chemotherapy agent dexamethasone on average went 26.3 months before the disease began to worsen. That compared with progression free survival of 17.6 months for two drugs without Kyprolis, Amgen said. “Although this result was mostly anticipated, there will be some relief at the news,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a research note. “The Aspire study is critical for the conversion of the drug’s current approval from accelerated, or conditional, approval to full approval in the U.S., as well as for initial approval of the drug in Europe,” noted Porges, who has forecast Kyprolis sales of $425 million in 2015 reaching $800 million in 2017. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in 2012, granted the drug accelerated approval for use in multiple myeloma, the second most common form of blood cancer, after prior therapies have stopped working. With accelerated approval, manufacturers must still conduct larger trials to bolster initial findings and gain final approval. The data may support the conversion of accelerated approval to full approval and help the company expand the current indication in the United States, Amgen said. Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology company, is expecting the Focus trial data, which could allow for use of Kyprolis earlier in the disease treatment, to be available in the current quarter. Meanwhile, the Aspire results were also good news for Celgene, Porges said, “as it provides additional evidence that Revlimid is the indispensable backbone for myeloma on which newer drugs and regimens are built.” Amgen shares were up $1.41, or 1.1 percent at $126.96 on Nasdaq. Celgene shares were up 0.7 percent at $87.30.

Shares of Amgen were down 2.1 percent at $124.65 in after-hours trading on Wednesday. “The negative results commercialization of this drug in earlier lines of myeloma, as well as other indications raise questions about the future development and ,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a research note. He also said the findings “place Kyprolis at a significant regulatory and competitive disadvantage” to Pomalyst, a multiple myeloma drug sold by Celgene Corp. Amgen said the 315-patient, phase III trial also showed an increase in bad kidney events for patients given Kyprolis when compared to the control group and to the risks described on the drug’s current label. The trial, known as FOCUS, included patients whose multiple myeloma had relapsed and worsened despite at least three prior therapies. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said failure of the trial “was widely expected,” given that patients in the control arm could eventually be treated with Kyprolis if their disease got worse. He also said the incidence of kidney-related side effects is “not a big concern” since the trial enrolled only very sick patients. Kyprolis, acquired by Amgen in its $10 billion takeover of Onyx Pharmaceuticals, was approved in the United States for treating advanced multiple myeloma based on data showing that patients responded to the drug. FOCUS was intended to show that the drug helped patients live longer, something that European regulators generally require before approving a drug. Amgen said in a statement that it believes positive results announced earlier this month from a separate study of Kyprolis in patients with earlier-stage disease “will be sufficient to support regulatory submissions around the world.” Separately, the Thousand Oaks, California, company said it would recall nine lots of syringes pre-filled with anemia drug Aranesp in several countries outside of the United States after finding particulate matter in a small number of syringes during a routine quality examination.

259,AMGN,"Lilly psoriasis drug impresses; battle nears with Amgen, Novartis","(Reuters) - An experimental new psoriasis treatment from Eli Lilly and Co proved superior to Amgen Inc’s blockbuster Enbrel, drawing it closer to a potential marketing battle with new products being developed by Amgen and Novartis AG. Based on favorable results from Phase III trials, Lilly said Thursday it would seek marketing approval in the first half of 2015 for its drug ixekizumab for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Cowen and Company analysts have forecast that ixekizumab, if approved, could generate annual sales for Lilly of $600 million by 2020. That would make it a mid-sized product for the company, which has annual sales of about $20 billion. Lilly needs new drugs to restore earnings growth, as profits have dropped for several years due to the expiration of patents on big products. Like rival injectable drugs being tested by Amgen and Novartis, Lilly’s treatment works by blocking an inflammation-causing protein called IL-17, deemed to be a major culprit in the skin disease.  Enbrel, Amgen’s older drug, is the most widely prescribed treatment for psoriasis and works by blocking a different protein, called tumor necrosis factor.  After 12 weeks, patients treated with ixekizumab had significantly greater clearance of raised skin patches that are a hallmark of psoriasis, compared with those who took placebos or Enbrel (etanercept) in the large trials, Lilly said. In all three studies, patients received either a placebo or ixekizumab every two or four weeks, for three months. In two of those studies, called UNCOVER-2 and 3, patients could receive Enbrel twice weekly. In UNCOVER-1, those responding to treatment continued to take either placebos or ixekizumab for up to 60 weeks.     Among patients treated with Lilly’s drug, 78 to 90 percent  experienced at least a 75 percent reduction of skin plaque at 12 weeks, based on a standard scale of psoriasis area and severity. Moreover, some 31 to 41 percent achieved clear skin. That compared with 5 to 7 percent of those treated with Enbrel in the UNCOVER-2 and 3 studies. In the UNCOVER-1 study, high levels of effectiveness were maintained through 60 weeks of treatment.  The overall rate and severity of side effects for ixekizumab were similar to those seen for Enbrel, including stuffy nose and reactions at the injection site, Lilly said. Novartis’ treatment against IL-17, secukinumab, recently met all its primary and secondary goals in late-stage trials, showing superiority to Enbrel in one study. Amgen and its partner AstraZeneca Plc in May reported favorable results for their anti-IL-17 drug, called brodalumab, in a late-stage trial. Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease in which the growth cycle of skin cells is accelerated.

Amgen is racing with Regeneron Inc to bring to market the potentially lucrative new drugs aimed at patients unable to tolerate widely used statins, and those who cannot sufficiently lower cholesterol despite use of statins, such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor, or other medicines. The injectable drugs work by blocking a naturally occurring protein called PCSK9 that prevents the liver from removing LDL cholesterol, the “bad” cholesterol, from the bloodstream. In large clinical trials, evolocumab cut LDL levels by more than 50 percent even in patients already taking other cholesterol medicines. Analysts have forecast multibillion-dollar sales for the new biotech drugs, if they demonstrate an ability to significantly reduce heart attacks and deaths in larger ongoing trials, as statins have. While Amgen was the first to file for U.S. approval of a PCSK9 inhibitor, Regeneron and French partner Sanofi have an ace up their sleeve that could enable them to catch up or even reach the market first with their drug, alirocumab. In late July, the companies said they paid $67.5 million to acquire a special voucher from BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc that could assure alirocumab an expedited six-month U.S. regulatory review, rather than the standard 10 months.

265,AMGN,"Study raises concerns over Servier, Amgen heart drug","BARCELONA (Reuters) - A major clinical study has raised concerns about a drug from private French company Servier that helps lower the heart rate and which was licensed to U.S. group Amgen last year. Ivabradine is not currently approved in the United States but it is sold in Europe for treating stable angina, or chest pain due to obstruction of heart arteries, and for heart failure, when the heart fails to pump blood effectively. Although lowering the heart rate is seen as good for both conditions, a 19,000-patient study presented on Sunday at the European Society of Cardiology congress found a large group of patients with severe activity-limiting angina did worse on the drug. The SIGNIFY trial had been designed to show that adding ivabradine to standard therapy would be beneficial. The negative result in the sub-group of 12,000 patients with severe angina meant it failed. The increase in the combined risk of cardiovascular death and heart attack in this patient group was small but statistically significant, with 7.6 percent of them suffering an adverse event against 6.5 percent of those on placebo. A commentary in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the results were also published, said more research was needed to understand the finding and in the meantime doctors should “exercise caution” in using the drug in severe angina patients. The European Medicines Agency said in May it had launched a review into the safety of the medicine, which is sold under the brand name Procoralan, because of the signal from the SIGNIFY trial. But the detailed results have only now been released. The agency could decide to maintain, amend, suspend or withdraw its approval for the drug. Servier said at the time it had informed all relevant regulators about the findings and would update doctors as soon as the European agency made a decision. Amgen, which signed a deal in July 2013 for U.S. commercial rights to ivabradine, last week won a priority review for the drug as a treatment for chronic heart failure from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

267,AMGN,"Early data suggest Sanofi, Regeneron drug may halve heart risk","* Good news for new PCSK9 drug class but needs confirmation * Sanofi, Regeneron vying with drugs from Amgen and Pfizer * Data from four alirocumab studies unveiled at ESC congress By Ben Hirschler BARCELONA, Aug 31 (Reuters) - An experimental cholesterol-lowering drug from Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals roughly halved the number of heart attacks and strokes in a clinical trial, researchers reported on Sunday. The result is not conclusive, because the analysis was done retrospectively, but it provides the first evidence that targeting a protein known as PCSK9 could slash cardiovascular risks for millions of patients. The injectable drug, alirocumab, is from a new class of medicines, which are also being developed by Amgen and Pfizer. They lower “bad” LDL cholesterol in a new way and are widely expected to reap multibillion-dollar sales. The finding is likely to spur enthusiasm about the drugs, which could reach the market next year, although experts said it still needed to be confirmed in a much larger trial. Sanofi and Regeneron said in July that nine big studies showed consistent LDL reductions with alirocumab, but details from four of these trials have only now been unveiled at the European Society of Cardiology annual meeting in Barcelona. The encouraging cardiovascular data come from an interim safety analysis of one of these studies showing patients on alirocumab were less prone to a combination of cardiovascular events, including cardiac death, heart attack, stroke and chest pain requiring hospitalisation. Both groups of patients got traditional anti-cholesterol statin pills in addition to alirocumab or a placebo. Among the alirocumab group, 1.4 percent of patients suffered a major cardiovascular event against 3.0 percent of those on placebo. The ongoing 2,341-patient study, called Odyssey Long Term, is expected to conclude early next year but researchers said the early sign of efficacy was clearly positive. “To have this result emerge so quickly in this study is very encouraging,” said Jennifer Robinson, a cardiologist at the University of Iowa, who led the study. No other drugmaker has previously released data suggesting reduced cardiovascular risk from PCSK9 inhibitors. Patrick O’Gara of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and president of the American College of Cardiology said the finding was “biologically plausible” but the post-hoc or retrospective nature of the analysis necessitated caution. “It’s so much wished-for that we must be careful,” he said. Sanofi and Regeneron are in a fierce race with Amgen, which last week became the first company to file with regulators to sell its product evolocumab. The French and U.S. partners hope to close the gap after paying $67.5 million last month for a voucher from BioMarin Pharmaceutical designed to assure alirocumab an expedited U.S. regulatory review. It is unclear if the rival PCSK9 drugs will prove to be very different from each other but Sanofi’s research head Elias Zerhouni thinks alirocumab should enjoy an early advantage from the preliminary indication of improved cardiovascular results. That may help convince cost-conscious healthcare providers to pay up for an expensive new medicine before results from the large 18,000-patient trial are available in 2017 or 2018. “It has to be confirmed by the big outcomes study but it is the first scientific indication that there is something other than a statin that potentially shows you can get a reduction in risk,” Zerhouni told Reuters. All four trials presented in Barcelona showed alirocumab cut LDL by around 50-60 percent after 24 weeks. Side effects included stuffy nose and upper respiratory tract infections. Doctors and regulatory authorities are watching closely to see if cutting LDL so sharply may have an adverse effect on other parts of the body, notably the brain. So far, there is no sign of this. There was a small non-statistically significant trend towards more neurocognitive problems in Odyssey Long Term but the other three studies showed alirocumab patients had fewer such issues. PCSK9 drugs will be targeted first at people with a rare familial condition that raises their cholesterol dangerously, as well as statin-intolerant patients and those at high-risk of a heart attack who struggle to control LDL on current medicines. Sanofi and Regeneron estimate this high-risk group totals around 21 million patients in the United States and Europe. Whether the drugs, which will be offered in pre-filled syringes and auto-injector pens, will be used more generally depends on how their cost-effective they are deemed to be. The companies say it is premature to talk about price but it is clear the antibody-based therapies will not be cheap, with Barclays analysts suggesting $6,000 a year as a possible price in the United States, with a lower price likely in Europe.

The drug, ABP 501, was being tested in a late-stage trial in patients with plaque psoriasis, a skin disease caused by dysfunction of the immune system and which leads to painful, itchy red patches. Humira, a rheumatoid arthritis injection, is also approved for a number of other inflammatory diseases including plaque psoriasis. The drug, whose patents will start expiring in December 2016, generated sales of $10.66 billion in 2013. “We remain bullish about AMGN’s biosimilar prospects given the manufacturing expertise which would likely be key for success in biosimilar competition,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note, pegging the future value of Amgen’s biosimilar business at $18 per share with a 100 percent probability. Amgen has six biosimilar molecules in development and expects to launch the portfolio starting in 2017. The trial met the main goal, with patients showing improvement based on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, a measure of the average redness, thickness and scaliness of the lesions at week 16, Amgen said. This is the first of the two late-stage trials which will support the company’s regulatory applications for the drug. Drug makers are currently chasing an emerging market for cheaper copies of costly biotech drugs, with more than 700 so-called biosimilars now in development or already approved, according to a major study of the sector published in September. Major companies involved in the emerging biosimilars sector include Novartis AG’s Sandoz unit and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and Pfizer Inc.

272,AMGN,Third Point's Loeb urges breakup of biotech company Amgen,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb told investors on Tuesday he  urged U.S. biotechnology company Amgen Inc to split into two separate businesses, a move he said could boost its share price by more than 80 percent. “Our own extensive diligence suggests that a breakup of Amgen is feasible and that purported constraints such as tax strategy and supply chain management can be managed,” he said in a quarterly letter sent to investors by his Third Point hedge fund. Loeb, who ranks among the industry’s most closely followed investors - returning an average 17.5 percent per year since 1996 - also said Third Point made new bets on eBay Inc and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, while exiting other holdings such as Sony Corp. The letter said Amgen, in which Third Point is an investor, has “all the hallmarks of a hidden value situation.”  It added that investors would likely welcome a split into what Third Point calls MatureCo and GrowthCo. Loeb, who has been making more activist bets and is known to lob sharply worded directives at underperforming chief executives, called Amgen CEO Bob Bradway open-minded and receptive to the idea of a split. Amgen, the world’s largest biotech company by sales, needs to improve its research and development evaluation, Third Point said, adding that recent cost cuts did not even scratch the surface. Amgen said it appreciates the perspectives of all of its shareholders, including Third Point. “The board and management continually assess Amgen’s strategic priorities - and, when appropriate, take action - to set the best path forward to increase shareholder value,” the company said. Amgen has scheduled a business update for investors and analysts on Oct. 28 at which it will provide details on the restructuring plans it announced in July. Third Point recently created a Scientific and Medical Advisory Board led by oncologist Dr. David Agus, the former doctor of Apple CEO Steve Jobs. The board will help evaluate therapeutic companies and their clinical assets. The letter also touched on this month’s wild equity market swings, which have been partly blamed on hedge funds. Third Point said it still likes investing in the United States and is betting that “large-cap opportunities with a constructivist angle will become more promising.” The hedge fund had cut its exposures over the last week, but has now taken new positions and returned to stocks it still likes but sold earlier at much higher prices.

273,AMGN,UPDATE 3-Third Point's Loeb urges breakup of biotech company Amgen,"(Adds link to Breakingviews) By Svea Herbst-Bayliss BOSTON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb told investors on Tuesday he  urged U.S. biotechnology company Amgen Inc to split into two separate businesses, a move he said could boost its share price by more than 80 percent. “Our own extensive diligence suggests that a breakup of Amgen is feasible and that purported constraints such as tax strategy and supply chain management can be managed,” he said in a quarterly letter sent to investors by his Third Point hedge fund. Loeb, who ranks among the industry’s most closely followed investors - returning an average 17.5 percent per year since 1996 - also said Third Point made new bets on eBay Inc  and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, while exiting other holdings such as Sony Corp. The letter said Amgen, in which Third Point is an investor, has “all the hallmarks of a hidden value situation.” It added that investors would likely welcome a split into what Third Point calls MatureCo and GrowthCo. Loeb, who has been making more activist bets and is known to lob sharply worded directives at underperforming chief executives, called Amgen CEO Bob Bradway open-minded and receptive to the idea of a split. Amgen, the world’s largest biotech company by sales, needs to improve its research and development evaluation, Third Point said, adding that recent cost cuts did not even scratch the surface. Amgen said it appreciates the perspectives of all of its shareholders, including Third Point. “The board and management continually assess Amgen’s strategic priorities - and, when appropriate, take action - to set the best path forward to increase shareholder value,” the company said. Amgen has scheduled a business update for investors and analysts on Oct. 28 at which it will provide details on the restructuring plans it announced in July. Third Point recently created a Scientific and Medical Advisory Board led by oncologist Dr. David Agus, the former doctor of Apple CEO Steve Jobs. The board will help evaluate therapeutic companies and their clinical assets. The letter also touched on this month’s wild equity market swings, which have been partly blamed on hedge funds. Third Point said it still likes investing in the United States and is betting that “large-cap opportunities with a constructivist angle will become more promising.” The hedge fund had cut its exposures over the last week, but has now taken new positions and returned to stocks it still likes but sold earlier at much higher prices. Amgen shares rose $6.58, or 4.8 percent, to close at $144.09 on Nasdaq.

The firm, which has returned an average 17.5 percent per year to investors, wrote in its quarterly letter that it feels biotech firm Amgen has “all the hallmarks of a hidden value situation.” “We believe the obscured fundamental value and investor skepticism that have led to Amgen’s valuation discount can be easily unlocked,” the firm said in the letter which was seen by Reuters.

276,AMGN,"Despite Third Point, low expectations for Amgen breakup","(Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), one of the world’s largest biotechnology companies, will unveil next week its first strategy update since early 2013, but few expect a major shift like the split-up recently proposed by Daniel Loeb’s Third Point hedge fund. In a letter to investors on Tuesday, Loeb said Amgen has “all the hallmarks of a hidden value situation” and should divide into an innovation-driven entity and a low-spending, slower-growth company made up of its older drugs. Third Point is not the first among investors or analysts to suggest the company would benefit from splitting into different companies, echoing a blueprint activists have advanced in various industries.  But Amgen is likely to resist such calls. At least some investors in the biotech say that is fine with them, given the company’s steady returns as well as the potential disruption from a split to its distribution model and tax structure. “This thing is a massively successful money machine. Why anybody would want to interrupt that I don’t know,” said Bill Smead, portfolio manager of the Smead Value Fund, which owns 357,000 Amgen shares. An ISI Group survey this week, taken after Loeb kicked off his campaign, found 65 percent of responding investors think the company should not split up. Amgen will announce its third quarter earnings on Monday, followed by a “business review” meeting in New York with analysts on Tuesday. The company last updated its long-term strategy in February 2013, shortly after Chief Executive Robert Bradway took office. Since then, Amgen’s shares have climbed 71 percent, compared with a 98 percent gain for the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index .NBI over the same period. Unlike other biotechnology companies, Amgen also pays an annual dividend yielding around 2 percent. Loeb argued that shareholder value would be unlocked by separating Amgen’s older products, like anemia drugs Epogen and Aranesp and white blood cell booster Neupogen, from the company’s experimental prospects, which include cholesterol treatment evolocumab and leukemia drug blinatumomab. But at a Wall Street forum last month, Bradway said Amgen had considered such a breakup, but did not believe it would create significant value because of the company’s single manufacturing and distribution channel.  He also cited the company’s “very efficient tax structure,” which stems from its practice of producing many of its drugs in Puerto Rico. Under a nearly 100-year-old section of U.S. tax law, companies that have Puerto Rican manufacturing operations are allowed to exclude from federal tax much of the income generated by those plants. That structure, along with tax credits and other tax reduction strategies, has helped cap Amgen’s effective tax rate, which the company forecasts at 15 to 18 percent this year, well below the 35 percent top U.S. corporate tax rate. Breaking up the company could push the tax rate for Amgen’s “legacy” business as high as 35 percent, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said in a research note. Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges, who first proposed an Amgen split-up in June, dismissed that argument, saying “there are a thousand ways companies could manage tax.” Porges, and others on Wall Street, expect Amgen to unveil on Tuesday plans to improve its operating profit margin, which he estimated in the low 40 percent range this year, compared with rates of 52 percent and 70 percent, respectively, for peers like Celgene Corp (CELG.O) and Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O). That might be enough to stave off calls for more radical change, especially since Amgen shares, after dipping in May, are up nearly 30 percent year to date, he said.

277,AMGN,Amgen profit tops Wall Street expectations; raises 2014 outlook,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) on Monday reported higher-than-expected third quarter earnings and revenue, even as net profit fell due to a hefty restructuring charge, and the company raised its full-year forecast and the number of job cuts it expects to make. The world’s largest biotechnology company recorded a $376 million charge related to restructuring moves announced July 29 and expects to take another charge of up to $150 million in the fourth quarter, as well as additional charges next year.  Amgen shares rose 1 percent. They are up about 20 percent since the restructuring announcement that involved plant closings and job cuts, now expected to exceed 2,900. The company had previously estimated 2,400 to 2,900 job cuts as it looks to reallocate resources to prepare for the launch of new medicines, including a potential multibillion-dollar cholesterol drug. Further details of the restructuring are expected to be laid out at a business update for analysts and investors in New York on Tuesday. Excluding items, Amgen earned $2.30 per share, exceeding analysts’ average expectations by 19 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Amgen said it now expects 2014 adjusted earnings of $8.45 to $8.55 per share, up from the boosted forecast it provided in July of $8.20 to $8.40 per share. The company expects full-year revenue of $19.8 billion to $20 billion. It previously forecast $19.5 billion to $19.7 billion. “The numbers on the top line were a little better than we thought and on the bottom line in particular they were very strong,” said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt. “The guidance went up. It looked very conservative, but also certainly welcome,” he added.

Sales of the white blood cell booster Neulasta rose 5 percent to $1.19 billion, topping the $1.13 billion analysts had expected. Kyprolis, the multiple myeloma drug at the heart of Amgen’s nearly $10 billion acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals last year, had sales of $94 million, exceeding analysts’ expectations of $87 million and the previous quarter’s $78 million.

The company will boost its dividend by 30 percent, resume share repurchases, and hopes to improve its operating margin by 15 points, it said at a business update for analysts and investors. “The operating margin improvement is real and that’s probably the most positive thing people will take away,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges.  Chief Executive Robert Bradway said the company had considered the option of splitting into mature and growth product businesses - as urged by key investor, Daniel Loeb’s Third Point hedge fund - but determined the strategy created less value than the existing structure.  Still, he would “never say never,” Bradway said. Amgen, which has also been criticized by Loeb and others for not getting a big enough return on acquisitions, said it plans to focus future deals on drugs in early stages of development, which tend to be less expensive. Head of commercial operations, Tony Hooper, said the company expects to launch more drugs in the next three years than it has in the last 25.  The world’s largest biotechnology company forecast 2015 adjusted earnings of $9.05 to $9.40 a share on revenue of $20.8 billion to $21.3 billion. Analysts, on average, expect earnings of $9.07 per share on revenue of $20.34 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “They’re going to grow better and faster than anyone expected,” said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt. Amgen, which in July announced a restructuring that will include slashing more than 2,900 jobs, said it now sees annual cost savings of $1.5 billion by 2018. Beginning next year, Amgen said it will pay a quarterly dividend of 79 cents with further increases planned. The company plans to buy back about $2 billion in shares through 2015. It had suspended the buyback program after its nearly $10 billion purchase of Onyx Pharmaceuticals last year. Amgen highlighted new opportunities in asthma, heart disease and migraines, and said it expects pivotal data for 10 medicines by 2016. It has four drugs awaiting regulatory approval, including a potential multibillion-dollar cholesterol drug expected to reach the market next year.  The company, which previously announced plans to develop six biosimilars - less expensive versions of blockbuster biotech drugs - said it would expand that by three. It expects to launch five biosimilars between 2017 and 2019. Amgen declined to name the three new biosimilars, but said the branded drugs had 2013 sales of $5 billion. Bradway said he expects the biosimilar portfolio to be more than a $3 billion business. The company also said its next generation biomanufacturing, expected to come on line in 2017, will significantly cut costs. Amgen shares were up $7.65, or 5.2 percent, at $155.85 on Nasdaq.

The company will boost its dividend by 30 percent, resume share repurchases, and hopes to improve its operating margin by 15 points, it said at a business update for analysts and investors. “The operating margin improvement is real and that’s probably the most positive thing people will take away,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges. Chief Executive Robert Bradway said the company had considered the option of splitting into mature and growth product businesses - as urged by key investor, Daniel Loeb’s Third Point hedge fund - but determined the strategy created less value than the existing structure. Still, he would “never say never,” Bradway said. Amgen, which has also been criticized by Loeb and others for not getting a big enough return on acquisitions, said it plans to focus future deals on drugs in early stages of development, which tend to be less expensive. Head of commercial operations, Tony Hooper, said the company expects to launch more drugs in the next three years than it has in the last 25. The world’s largest biotechnology company forecast 2015 adjusted earnings of $9.05 to $9.40 a share on revenue of $20.8 billion to $21.3 billion. Analysts, on average, expect earnings of $9.07 per share on revenue of $20.34 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “They’re going to grow better and faster than anyone expected,” said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt. Amgen, which in July announced a restructuring that will include slashing more than 2,900 jobs, said it now sees annual cost savings of $1.5 billion by 2018. Beginning next year, Amgen said it will pay a quarterly dividend of 79 cents with further increases planned. The company plans to buy back about $2 billion in shares through 2015. It had suspended the buyback program after its nearly $10 billion purchase of Onyx Pharmaceuticals last year. Amgen highlighted new opportunities in asthma, heart disease and migraines, and said it expects pivotal data for 10 medicines by 2016. It has four drugs awaiting regulatory approval, including a potential multibillion-dollar cholesterol drug expected to reach the market next year. The company, which previously announced plans to develop six biosimilars - less expensive versions of blockbuster biotech drugs - said it would expand that by three. It expects to launch five biosimilars between 2017 and 2019. Amgen declined to name the three new biosimilars, but said the branded drugs had 2013 sales of $5 billion. Bradway said he expects the biosimilar portfolio to be more than a $3 billion business. The company also said its next generation biomanufacturing, expected to come on line in 2017, will significantly cut costs. Amgen shares were up $7.65, or 5.2 percent, at $155.85 on Nasdaq.

288,AMGN,Amgen ovarian cancer drug fails to improve overall survival,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said its experimental ovarian cancer drug did not show statistically significant improvement in overall survival rate in a late-stage trial. Patients given the drug, trebananib, along with a chemotherapy agent paclitaxel, experienced overall survival of 19.3 months, compared with 18.3 months for the placebo group.  Statistically significant improvement in overall survival was the secondary goal of the trial. The trial, TRINOVA-1, is the first of three late-stage studies to evaluate safety and effectiveness of the drug in ovarian cancer patients. The company in 2013 reported results on the main goal of trial, where patients survived longer without the disease getting worse when compared with a placebo. Jefferies analysts in a note published on Oct. 20 said oncologists expect the drug to have little or no benefits in terms of overall survival. “Thus, FDA approval is unlikely in our view,” they wrote.

Amgen is developing brodalumab under a multi-drug collaboration with AstraZeneca that involves splitting costs and eventual profits. After 12 weeks of treatment of 1,881 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, 36.7 percent who received the 210 milligram dose of brodalumab and 27 percent treated with 140 mg of the Amgen drug achieved total clearance of the skin disease. That compared with 18.5 percent of those treated with Stelara and 0.3 percent in the placebo group.

The most common adverse side effects seen with brodalumab were common cold symptoms, joint pain, upper respiratory tract infection and headache. There were more adverse side effects deemed to be serious with the Amgen antibody than with Stelara.

294,AMGN,U.S. FDA approves Amgen leukemia drug ahead of schedule,"(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Wednesday approved an Amgen Inc drug that helps the immune system fight a rare type of leukemia, more than five months ahead of the expected decision date. The drug, blinatumomab, which will be sold under the brand name Blincyto, was approved to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) for which there are few treatment options once a patient has relapsed. The initial approval is for patients whose cancer has returned after treatment or did not respond to previous treatment, such as a stem cell transplant or chemotherapy. Dr. Anthony Stein, professor of hematology at City of Hope outside Los Angeles who worked on clinical trials of blinatumomab, called the approval “very important” for patients. “It’s a very promising therapy and there are new trials trying to move the drug into an earlier stage of treatment,” Stein said.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration had given blinatumomab both its breakthrough designation, used for what it sees as potentially important new medicines, and a priority review, which typically cuts the approval decision time to six months from the normal 10 to 12 months. The action date under the priority review had been May 19, 2015. “Blincyto is being approved under the FDA’s accelerated approval program, which allows approval of a drug to treat a serious or life-threatening disease based on clinical data showing the drug has an effect ... reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit to patients,” the agency said. The program provides earlier patient access to promising new drugs while the company conducts further clinical trials to confirm the effectiveness of the medicine. In a clinical trail used for the approval decision, 32 percent of patients achieved complete remission for nearly seven months after receiving the drug via infusion for four weeks. “Immunotherapies, especially Blincyto with its unique mechanism of action, are particularly promising for patients with leukemia,” Richard Pazdur, head of FDA evaluation of cancer products, said in a statement. Blincyto will carry a boxed warning stating that in clinical trials some patients experienced low blood pressure and difficulty breathing at the start of the first treatment or experienced a short period of difficulty with thinking or other side effects in the nervous system. An estimated 6,020 Americans will be diagnosed with ALL and 1,440 will die from the disease in 2014, according to the National Cancer Institute.

297,AMGN,Sandoz loses bid to shield psoriasis drug,"(Reuters) - The top U.S. patent appeals court has upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by Sandoz Inc that sought to shield its planned version of Amgen Inc’s psoriasis and arthritis drug Enbrel from patent lawsuits. The ruling, handed down Friday by Judge Richard Taranto of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, does not stop Sandoz from developing its drug. Taranto only ruled that the lawsuit against Amgen was premature because Sandoz had not yet sought approval for the drug from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Sandoz, the generics arm of Novartis AG, sued Amgen in June 2013 seeking a judgment that its planned “biosimilar” version of Enbrel, a so-called biologic drug, would not infringe two of Amgen’s patents. At the same time, Sandoz announced it was launching a late-stage clinical trial of the drug. A U.S. District judge in Northern California dismissed the case in November 2013, and Sandoz appealed.    Biologic drugs such as Enbrel are complex substances derived from living organisms. Unlike traditional chemical drugs, they are difficult to replicate.  The 2009 federal Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act allows drugmakers to introduce biosimilar versions of existing biologics that need not be identical to the original. The law around biologics is largely untested. The FDA accepted its first biosimilar application only this year. In Friday’s opinion, Taranto declined to address whether Sandoz’s suit was barred by the federal biologics law. Amgen spokeswoman Kristen Davis said the company was pleased with the outcome. Sandoz did not immediately return a request for comment. Judges Timothy Dyk and Raymond Chen joined in Friday’s decision. The case is Sandoz Inc v.

300,AMGN,Addition of Amgen drug boosts benefits in relapsed myeloma: study,"(Reuters) - Significantly more patients with relapsed multiple myeloma responded to a three-drug regimen including Amgen Inc’s Kyprolis than those who got the standard two-drug treatment, according to results from a late-stage trial. Patients with the blood cancer who received the Kyprolis regimen for 18 months also had a longer duration of response and reported better health-related quality of life, data presented on Saturday showed. Overall survival data was not yet available, but researchers reported a trend toward improved survival seen with the three-drug regimen. The Phase III Aspire trial tested Kyprolis in combination with Celgene’s Revlimid and the chemotherapy drug dexamethasone versus the two drugs without Kyprolis in 792  patients whose disease relapsed after prior treatments. Amgen previously reported the Kyprolis regimen achieved the primary goal of the study by significantly increasing the time before the disease began to worsen. Details and results of secondary goals were being presented at the American Society of Hematology meeting in San Francisco. The data should help increase use of Kyprolis - the drug at the center of Amgen’s nearly $10 billion purchase of Onyx Pharmaceuticals. Kyprolis had $94 million in third quarter sales. “This is really an important study that’s going to set the stage for improved therapy for patients worldwide,” said Dr. Keith Stewart, the study’s lead investigator from Mayo Clinic in Arizona. “It probably establishes this (regimen) as the standard of care.” The overall response rate was 87 percent for the three drugs versus 67 percent for the current standard of care. Three times as many patients had a complete response to the Kyprolis regimen - meaning no detectable sign of cancer - 32 percent versus 9 percent. The median duration of response was 28.6 months for the Kyprolis group compared with 21.2 months for the control arm. Stewart said researchers now believe the results could have been even better had patients stayed on the Kyprolis regimen for longer than 18 months. About 114,000 new case of multiple myeloma - the second most common blood cancer - are diagnosed annually worldwide, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer.  The rate of adverse side effects and discontinuations due to side effects were nearly identical in the two groups, providing evidence that adding Kyprolis did not cause additional toxicities. “It was very reassuring with respect to the tolerability of the three-drug cocktail,” Stewart said.

302,AMGN,"Exclusive: Amgen's new leukemia drug to carry $178,000 price tag","(Reuters) - Amgen Inc on Wednesday said its new type of treatment for a deadly form of leukemia would cost about $178,000 when it becomes available on Thursday, which would make it one of the world’s most expensive cancer drugs.  Company spokeswoman Danielle Bertrand said the price for the infused medicine, called Blincyto, would reflect two courses of treatment, at $89,000 per cycle. “We believe the price reflects the significant clinical, economic and humanistic value of the product to patients and the healthcare system, for an ultra-orphan population with a dramatic impact on a serious illness,” Amgen said in an emailed statement.  U.S. regulators on Dec. 3 approved Blincyto to treat a rare blood cancer called acute lyphoblastic leukemia (ALL).  The initial approval is for patients whose cancer has returned after treatment or did not respond to previous treatment, such as a stem cell transplant or chemotherapy. In a clinical trial used for the approval decision, 32 percent of patients achieved complete remission for nearly seven months after receiving the drug via infusion for four weeks. An estimated 6,020 Americans in 2014, almost half of them children, will be diagnosed with ALL and 1,440 will die from the disease, according to the National Cancer Institute. “The overall price of Blincyto is definitely on the high side for cancer drugs,” said Michael Yee, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. But he said the price was not surprising given the drug’s impressive effectiveness and that only about 1,000 Americans who had failed previous therapy would be eligible to take it. Yee estimated Blincyto could reap annual sales of $100 million for ALL, assuming that half of all eligible patients take the medicine. “That would make it a pretty small drug,” he said.  Amgen acquired Blincyto through its $1.2 billion purchase in 2012 of Micromet, a biotechnology company founded in Germany. At the time, Blincyto was known by its chemical name, blinatumomab. The drug is a so-called bispecific antibody, a hot emerging technology that could prove more potent than conventional antibodies, which have become mainstay treatments for a wide array of cancers. Other costly immuno-oncology drugs, which work by harnessing the immune system, include Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s Yervoy treatment for melanoma, which costs about $120,000 for a complete course of four infusions. Merck & Co’s new Keytruda melanoma drug costs $150,000 for a year of treatment. Amgen shares were up 1.7 percent in afternoon trading.

303,AMGN,Express Scripts presses for more drug savings with coverage list,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Express Scripts, the largest manager of prescription drug plans for U.S. employers, is taking an increasingly aggressive stance in price negotiations with pharmaceutical companies after winning discounts on medications with a strategy introduced last year. On Monday, Express Scripts said it lined up a cheaper price for AbbVie Inc’s newly approved hepatitis C treatment and, in most cases, will no longer cover Gilead Sciences Inc’s   rival treatments after trying for nearly a year to win a deeper discount. [ID: nL1N0U61N4] The move threatens to undermine profits at Gilead, and was viewed by Wall Street as a sign that other major biotechnology players, including Amgen Inc and Biogen Inc, will face steeper U.S. pricing pressure from insurers. Other drugmakers without potentially transformative new products, such as Shire Plc, Novo Nordisk and Theravance Inc , may also be particularly vulnerable, analysts said. Neither Shire, Novo Nordisk nor Theravance responded to requests for comment. Express Scripts will further expand the number of medicines it won’t cover for 2016, including treatments for common illnesses such as diabetes, pulmonary hypertension and arthritis, said Chief Medical Officer Dr Steve Miller, in an interview earlier this month. In some cases, Express Scripts could drop coverage for newer specialty medicines in the biotechnology field, he said. The timing on specific drugs will depend on when new competing drugs with similar clinical benefits are approved for the U.S. market. Express Scripts first began excluding drugs from its largest national reimbursement list for 2014, with 44 medications, and increased that number to 66 for 2015. The prospect of having their drugs dropped from Express Scripts’ biggest “formulary” list of covered medicines has prompted some leading pharmaceutical makers to discount their prices, Miller said. Express Scripts is acting on behalf of clients who need to rein in healthcare costs, and estimates that the move has so far saved such employers more than $1 billion in annual spending, Miller said. Employers “are by necessity asking us to take a more aggressive stance because the affordability of their benefits is really at risk,” Miller said. “We are going to be opportunistic” in looking for savings in the future. Gilead shares dropped more than 14 percent in Monday trading to $92.90. Shares in Amgen, Biogen and Celgene CELG.O fell more than 2 percent. The second largest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager, CVS Health Corp, has said it will exclude 95 prescription products from its reimbursement list next year, up from 72 in 2014. It expects the practice will save its plan sponsors over $3.5 billion between 2012 and 2015. The drugs most under scrutiny include more expensive, “me-too” products, in categories where several drugmakers compete for similar patients. Both Novo Nordisk and Sanofi SA  are developing slightly longer-lasting insulins. Amgen, AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson, respectively sell Enbrel, Humira and Remicade - all rheumatoid arthritis drugs that work in a similar way. Companies like Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries and Actavis want to switch patients to more expensive versions of their multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s drugs, respectively, before the arrival of cheap generic competitors. The effect is already being felt by such Big Pharma players as AstraZeneca Plc and Sanofi. Both companies warned recently that the need to offer U.S. price discounts on some of their biggest brand-name medicines will hurt 2015 sales. Insurers are pushing back against prices in other categories, including blood thinners and even HIV drugs and multiple sclerosis treatments, where there are multiple options for doctors and patients, observers said. “The extent of this becoming a broader problem is tied to whether we get great new drugs for things like asthma, (high cholesterol), Alzheimer’s and cancer,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal. “If there is a limited pool of money and a bunch of new drugs, the pressure on older drugs will increase.” In recent years, the introduction of far cheaper generic versions of medicines like Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor to reduce cholesterol and Merck & Co’s asthma drug Singulair helped insurers save on reimbursement costs. But that wave of patent expiries has slowed considerably. In the meantime, a new crop of novel, and in some cases, highly effective treatments for cancer and hepatitis C are costing them tens of billions of dollars more to reimburse. The influx of generics “allowed the system to actually see drug price deflation,” said Asher Anolic, manager of Fidelity’s Select Pharmaceuticals Portfolio. “At the same time, others are launching innovative new drugs ... Based on those dynamics I get more concerned. Where is the give in the system? It’s on the legacy products.” Anolic said his Fidelity fund focuses on drugmakers with highly differentiated portfolios of treatments. Its top holdings as of Sept 30 included Actavis, AbbVie, Novartis AG  and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. “When you look at the industry as a whole, we will probably see less profitability,” said Nils Behnke, a partner at consulting firm Bain & Co. “Mid-sized companies with a broader portfolio of little products, ‘me-too’ products - they will have a hard time.” Murray Aitken, vice president at healthcare information company IMS Health, estimates that 2014 spending on new and innovative brand-name drugs will total about $20 billion compared with about $3 billion in 2012. Industry executives say newer health plans, whether purchased by individual consumers or offered through an employer, will further accelerate efforts to limit drug prices because they require patients to pay a higher share of prescription costs. Pharmacy benefits companies like Express Scripts say they will cover an excluded medicine if that specific treatment is deemed medically necessary for a patient. Some groups have expressed concern that patient care might be compromised. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a leading drug industry trade group, said such practices hurt patients by limiting access to a range of appropriate medicines and potentially discriminating against certain conditions. But insurers say that the high price of new drugs set by manufacturers has already deterred some patients from following doctor’s orders. “Plan sponsors, because of the rapid rise in cost, are many times having to ask the consumer to pay more” for their medicines, said Express Scripts’ Miller. “If you can’t afford your healthcare, you don’t take it.” ",12232014,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-usa-expressscripts/express-scripts-presses-for-more-drug-savings-with-coverage-list-idUSL1N0U70ML20141223

305,AMGN,FDA staff recommends Novartis copy of Amgen's Neupogen,"(Reuters) - Staff reviewers at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended approval of Novartis AG’s copy of Amgen Inc’s blockbuster cancer drug Neupogen, finding no “clinically meaningful differences” between the two. The Swiss drugmaker’s drug is the first to be reviewed in the United States under the so-called biosimilar pathway. Biosimilars, or copies of biotech drugs, are yet to make inroads in the country due to the lack of an established regulatory framework. The injectable biologic prevents infections in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, which reduces white blood cells, giving rise to a condition called neutropenia. The reviewers recommended that Novartis's copy should be cleared for all five indications for which Neupogen is approved, the FDA said on Monday. (1.usa.gov/1DoT7eb) Independent experts are scheduled to meet on Wednesday to recommend whether the copy should be approved. Novartis’s generics business, Sandoz, already makes copies of Amgen’s Neupogen and sells them under the brand name Zarzio in over 40 countries outside the United States. The country accounted for nearly 84 percent of Neupogen’s $1.4 billion in sales in 2013. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd won FDA approval in 2012 to market a drug that is in many ways a copy of Amgen’s Neupogen, but not under the biosimilar pathway. Biologics, made from living cells, have safer profiles and stronger efficacy in treating cancers and immunological diseases, consequently carrying hefty price tags which limits their use. Biosimilars, which typically cost 20-30 percent less than their reference biologic, are expected to account for about one quarter of the $100 billion sales stemming from off-patent biologics by the end of the decade, according to Thomson Reuters BioWorld.  However, as biologics are made from living cells, creating a copy is an arduous process with unpredictable results. Therefore, unlike knockoffs of simple chemical drugs, copies of biologics can only be “similar”, never identical. The reviewers focused on biosimilarity and not the higher bar of interchangeability or substitutability, Evercore ISI analysts said, setting a possible precedent for other biosimilars in the United States. Drugmakers, including South Korea’s Celltrion Inc, are racing to develop biosimilars ahead of the looming expiry of patents on big-ticket biologics as cash-strapped healthcare systems worldwide look to curb spending. Meanwhile, Amgen and Sandoz are embroiled in a legal dispute related to the interpretation of patent litigation provisions of the U.S. biosimilar pathway, first issued in 2012.

313,AMGN,UPDATE 1-Express Scripts sees opportunity to lower cancer treatment cost,"(Adds Amgen, Regeneron comments) By Susan Kelly and Bill Berkrot Jan 13 (Reuters) - Express Scripts, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, on Tuesday said cost savings on expensive cancer treatments could be achieved if the company were involved earlier in the decision-making process. Express Scripts, which has become more aggressive in negotiating discounts on drugs for insurance plans and employers, in December stopped covering Gilead Sciences Inc’s  hepatitis C treatments after lining up a cheaper price for AbbVie’s newly-approved alternative. Gilead’s Sovaldi and follow-up combination pill Harvoni have been shown to cure hepatitis C in more than 90 percent of patients. But Express deemed the more than $90,000 price for 12 weeks of Harvoni treatment unaffordable. The move reignited investor concerns that drugmakers will have to bow to pricing pressure from U.S. insurers and lawmakers over novel medications whose cost can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars for some diseases. For cancer patients, treatment decisions typically go through health insurance plans first, and medicines are not changed once people have begun their regimens, Express Scripts Chief Executive George Paz said at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco. He said PBMs should be included in the decision-making process at a much earlier stage. “The big opportunity out there is really in cancer,” Paz said. “If we can get out in front of that, that is a huge opportunity.” Paz said he is also focused on a new crop of cholesterol-lowering drugs expected to hit the market this year, and is talking to companies about market share, positioning and pricing. “They are pretty astonishing, but they are also very expensive,” Paz said of the drugs which target a protein known as PCSK9. Manufacturers include Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc in partnership with Sanofi . The key is to determine which are real breakthrough treatments and which are “me too” drugs, Paz said. Amgen said it was talking to payers about its evolocumab, and believes they can only exclude a drug from formularies if there is no clinical difference between rival medicines. “If not, payers will have to leave choices to physicians,” said Tony Hooper, Amgen’s head of commercial operations. Regeneron Chief Executive Officer Len Schleifer was asked if he was concerned about Paz’s comments that PCSK9 drugs were in his sights. “It’s not a worry. It’s a reality that we will deal with,” Schleifer said. “I think there will be fair pricing and healthy competition in the marketplace.”   (Reporting by Susan Kelly in Chicago and Bill Berkrot in New York; Editing by Christian Plumb, Bernard Orr)",1132015,http://www.reuters.com/article/healthcare-expressscripts-drugprices/update-1-express-scripts-sees-opportunity-to-lower-cancer-treatment-cost-idUSL1N0US1Z120150113
314,AMGN,Regeneron/Sanofi cholesterol drug gets FDA priority review,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals on Monday said U.S. health regulators accepted its application to review a potent  cholesterol drug on a priority basis, potentially giving it the upper hand in a fierce race with Amgen to bring a new medicine from the promising class to market. Regeneron, which is developing the drug, alirocumab, in partnership with Sanofi, said the target date for a Food and Drug Administration approval decision was July 24, following a six-month review period. That could put the medicine on the U.S. market a month ahead of Amgen’s rival evolocumab. Amgen was first to file its application, but received a standard 10-month review from the FDA, giving it an action date of Aug 27. Regeneron and Sanofi, which were seen as lagging Amgen, employed an unusual strategy to catch up, purchasing a special priority review voucher from BioMarin Pharmaceutical for $67.5 million. The drugs belong to a highly promising new class called PCSK9 inhibitors that block a protein that prevents the liver from removing bad LDL cholesterol from the blood. In clinical trials, they have shown an ability to lower LDL levels by more than 50 percent. The injectable biotech medicines are expected to be used in high-risk heart patients who are unable to tolerate statins, such as Pfizer’s Lipitor, or those who cannot get LDL levels low enough with statins. They are expected to be expensive, with analysts forecasting annual sales of $3 billion for each of the drugs. Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding said it was looking at the class with an eye toward negotiating a lower price from one company in exchange for priority status on its formulary for its millions of customers. Express used the strategy with new hepatitis C treatments, getting a lower price from AbbVie and excluding Gilead’s drugs. The first company to bring a PCSK9 drug to market would not only have a period to launch the medicine without competition, but would set the price for the class. Pfizer is also working on a PCSK9 drug that will likely be third to market. Regeneron and Sanofi submitted an application for European approval of alirocumab earlier this month. The companies have proposed the brand name Praluent for their product once approved.

317,AMGN,"Amgen profit tops expectations on Enbrel sales, tax credit","(Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) on Tuesday reported higher-than-expected fourth-quarter profit, driven by strong sales of its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel and a tax credit. Despite pressure on overseas sales from the strong dollar that has put a crimp in pharmaceutical company profits, Amgen reiterated the 2015 forecast it provided in October for adjusted earnings of $9.05 to $9.40 per share on revenue of $20.8 billion to $21.3 billion. Analysts are estimating earnings of $9.28 per share and revenue of $20.87 billion. Amgen is less exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations than other large drugmakers as only about 25 percent of its sales come from outside the United States. Excluding items, Amgen earned $2.16 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 11 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The results were helped by a research and development tax credit that came through in the quarter, adding about 10 cents per share to earnings, the company said. On the positive side, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said “they affirmed the strong 2015 outlook.” But, he added, a good chunk of the earnings beat “came from a tax credit that was not in the guidance.” The world’s largest biotechnology company posted a net profit of $1.29 billion, or $1.68 per share, compared with a profit of $1.02 billion, or $1.33 per share, a year ago. Revenue rose 6 percent to $5.33 billion, edging past Wall Street estimates of $5.19 billion. Enbrel sales rose 11 percent in the quarter to $1.34 billion, topping analyst expectations of $1.21 billion. The white blood cell boosters Neupogen and Neulasta had combined worldwide sales of $1.45 billion. The older Neupogen is expected to face competition this year from the first U.S. approved biosimilar version. Kyprolis, the multiple myeloma drug Amgen acquired with its $10 billion purchase of Onyx Pharmaceuticals, had sales of $91 million, falling short of Wall Street estimates of $109 million. However, based on positive clinical trial data, Amgen said it filed applications with U.S. and European regulators to approve Kyprolis use earlier in the disease, after one prior treatment has failed rather than two. This should boost future sales. U.S. approval decisions on two new drugs, ivabradine for heart failure and T-Vec for melanoma, will be delayed by three months each as regulators asked for additional data, which Amgen said it has supplied.

320,AMGN,UPDATE 2-CVS urges cost controls for new cholesterol drugs,"(Adds comment from CVS rival Express Scripts, other background) By Ransdell Pierson Feb 17 (Reuters) - CVS Health warned on Tuesday that the costs of a potent new class of cholesterol treatments could eclipse those of other expensive medicines and overwhelm the U.S. healthcare system “if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place.” Two of the new injectable cholesterol treatments, called PCSK9 inhibitors, could gain U.S. approval this summer. CVS said they could eventually be used by as many as 15 million patients at an annual cost of up to $150 billion a year if priced at $7,000 to $12,000 a year, making it the highest-selling class of drugs in history. “The resilience and ability of our health care system to absorb such high costs will be tested if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place,” William Shrank, chief scientific officer for CVS, said in a statement. CVS, the second-largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), negotiates drug prices for 65 million people through contracts with employers and health plans. The CVS call for cost controls follows sharp criticism from insurers, other payers and politicians over the high cost of new, highly effective treatments for hepatitis C, especially two medicines from Gilead Science Inc that have retail prices of up to $94,500 per patient for a course of treatment. Unlike those drugs, which are typically taken for about 12 weeks, the PCSK9s would be used for a lifetime. Express Scripts, the largest U.S. PBM, which has waged a campaign against Gilead’s hepatitis C drugs and is now scrutinizing costly cancer medications, provided a slightly different view of the new cholesterol drug market. Express Scripts also expects annual costs of around $10,000 per year per patient. But it sees a patient population that will start small before it ever reaches a possible high of 10 million people and a potential annual cost of $100 billion. Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview that limits set by regulators and the fact that the first wave of drugs are injections may slow their uptake. “We are going to work to get these products at the best price possible, but they also deserve to get value in the marketplace,” Miller said. Amgen Inc and a partnership of Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc are awaiting approval of rival PCSK9 inhibitors. They are expected to be used first by patients who are genetically prone to extreme high cholesterol - a population that CVS and Express peg at 620,000 Americans. They also are likely to be used by those who cannot tolerate standard statin treatments, like Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor. Amgen declined to comment on the pricing issue and Regeneron did not respond to a request for comment. Shares of Amgen closed up 0.5 percent at $154.24, while Regeneron’s stock gained 0.4 percent to $404.18. Sanofi’s shares slipped 0.2 percent to 85.53 euros in trading in Paris.

321,AMGN,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-CVS urges cost controls for new cholesterol, specialty drugs","(Corrects first paragraph to show that CVS move was on Tuesday, not Monday) By Ransdell Pierson Feb 17 (Reuters) - CVS Health on Tuesday warned that costs of a potent new class of cholesterol treatments and other specialty drugs in development could eclipse those of expensive new medicines and overwhelm the healthcare system “if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place.” CVS, the second largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager which negotiates drug prices for 65 million people through contracts with employers and health plans, noted that two of the new injectable cholesterol fighters - called PCSK9 inhibitors - could be approved by mid-2015 and likely each cost $7,000 to $12,000 a year. All told, PCSK9 inhibitors could eventually cost the healthcare system as much as $150 billion a year and become the highest-selling class of drugs in history, CVS said. “The resilience and ability of our health care system to absorb such high costs will be tested if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place,” William Shrank, chief scientific officer for CVS, said in a statement. The company added that the sky-high prices of the new cholesterol drugs could pave the way for other very costly specialty drugs. CVS’ call for cost controls follows sharp criticism from insurers, other payers and politicians of the high costs of recently approved oral treatments for hepatitis C, especially two brands from Gilead Science Inc that have retail prices of up to $94,500. Those drugs wipe out the liver virus in more than 90 percent of patients and don’t need to be used beyond 12 weeks for most patients. By contrast, CVS warned that the new cholesterol drugs might be needed “for the duration of patients’ lives” and eventually be deemed appropriate for as many as 15 million Americans. Amgen Inc and a partnership of Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc are awaiting U.S. approval of their rival PCSK9 inhibitors. They are expected to be approved for patients who are genetically prone to high levels of cholesterol - a population that CVS pegs at 620,000 Americans. They also are likely to be used for those who cannot tolerate standard statin treatments, like Pfizer Inc’s  Lipitor. The experimental treatments, in combination with statins,  knocked down their levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol by as much as 60 percent more than statins alone. Gilead’s Harvoni, which combines Sovaldi with another of its  anti-viral medicines into a daily pill, won U.S. approval late last year and has a retail price of $94,500. By itself, Sovaldi’s list price is $84,000 per treatment. Gilead has acknowledged negotiating price discounts with payers of more than 40 percent for the two hepatitis C brands, as it vies for market share with a newer rival therapy from AbbVie called Viekira Pak. Shares of Amgen were up 0.8 percent on Tuesday on the Nasdaq, while Regeneron’s stock gained 2.2 percent. Sanofi’s shares slipped 0.3 percent in trading in Paris.

322,AMGN,UPDATE 1-Amgen says Kyprolis doubles progression-free survival vs Velcade,"(Adds Kyprolis price, details of prior trial in relapsed patients, details of oral Velcade) By Deena Beasley March 1 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc’s Kyprolis helped patients with relapsed multiple myeloma live twice as long before their blood cancer worsened compared to a regimen containing rival drug Velcade, according to an interim analysis announced by the company on Sunday. Kyprolis, the centerpiece of Amgen’s nearly $10 billion acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals in 2013, had sales last year of $331 million. Velcade, sold by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co  and Johnson & Johnson, had 2014 sales of nearly $3 billion. The interim look showed that patients with relapsed multiple myeloma treated with Kyprolis and chemotherapy dexamethasone lived for a median of 18.7 months before their disease worsened, compared with 9.4 months for patients treated with Velcade and the chemotherapy drug. Amgen said the study has yet to show a difference in  survival between the two groups, but said it did demonstrate superiority for Kyprolis in secondary goals of higher overall response rate and lower incidence of nerve pain. Sean Harper, Amgen’s head of research and development, said the study will continue until overall survival can be determined. “This was the bet we made when we acquired Onyx,” he said. “To be able to demonstrate something compelling enough with respect to the difference between Kyprolis and Velcade,” which will lose U.S. patent protection in 2017. Rates of cardiac failure and kidney failure for Kyprolis were higher than for patients treated with Velcade. There was also an increase in the incidence of hypertension and shortness of breath in the Kyprolis group compared to Velcade. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in 2012, granted Kyprolis accelerated approval for use in multiple myeloma, the second most common form of blood cancer, after prior therapies  stopped working. The Amgen drug has a wholesale price of over $10,000 a month. Amgen filed earlier this year for FDA approval of Kyprolis as a second-line myeloma treatment based on positive results from a study comparing the drug in combination with dexamethasone and Celgene Corp’s Revlimid, to a regimen containing just Revlimid and the chemotherapy drug. Results from a head-to-head trial comparing Kyprolis to Velcade in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients are likely to come in 2016, Harper said. Takeda has announced positive results from a trial of its oral version of Velcade, which like Kyprolis, must be given by infusion. Harper said Amgen expects that oral drugs in this class, proteosome inhibitors, will likely be used as “maintenance” treatments for myeloma patients whose disease is first controlled by existing, infused drugs. “Demonstrating superiority over Velcade in this head-to-head trial supports our goal of ensuring continued improvement of patient outcomes and potentially establishing Kyprolis as the backbone of therapy for patients with multiple myeloma,” Pablo Cagnoni, president of Amgen’s Onyx unit, said in a statement.

323,AMGN,UPDATE 2-Novartis wins approval for first U.S. biosimilar drug,"* Zarxio from Novartis generics unit Sandoz approved by FDA * Copy of Amgen’s white cell-boosting medicine Neupogen * Sandoz exec says Zarxio will be priced “competitively” * Amgen seeking to block biosimilar’s launch   (Adds Amgen comment) By Deena Beasley and Ben Hirschler March 6 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Friday gave a green light to sales of the country’s first “biosimilar,” or copied version of a biotechnology drug, by approving Novartis’  white blood cell-boosting Zarxio. The drug contains the same active ingredient as Amgen Inc’s   Neupogen, or filgrastim, which generated 2014 sales of $1.2 billion worldwide. The Food and Drug Administration said it approved Zarxio for  the same five conditions for which Neupogen is used - preventing infections in cancer patients undergoing various treatments. The move had been expected after Zarxio, which is made by Novartis’ Sandoz generics unit, won unanimous backing from an FDA panel in January. Biosimilars have been available in Europe since 2006. Health insurers have said biotech drugs with expired patents should also face lower-cost competition in the United States, leading to savings in the same way generic versions of conventional medicines have cut prescription costs. The FDA, however, only received the authority to approve biosimilars with the passing of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, in 2010. Biological medicines, whose price tags can run into tens of thousands of dollars per patient per year, account for about 30 percent of U.S. drug spending. Unlike chemical compounds, such as aspirin or statins, biotech drugs are made inside living cells, and tiny variations are inevitable, depending on the exact production process. As a result, a copycat version can only ever be similar to the original, rather than identical. One technical uncertainty with a biosimilar is its official generic name, an important point for pharmacists filling prescriptions. The FDA said Zarxio would, for now, carry the hyphenated name “filgrastim-sndz” while the agency works on a comprehensive naming policy. In a statement, Amgen said it believed Neupogen, with a wholesale price of $315 for the lowest packaged daily dose,  “continues to have an important role to play in helping patients.” Sandoz declined to specify Zarxio’s pricing ahead of the U.S. introduction. “The only thing we can say is it will be competitively priced,” Carol Lynch, global head of biopharmaceuticals and oncology injectables, told Reuters. Amgen has sued to block Zarxio. Sandoz previously agreed to delay its U.S. launch until a court decision on Amgen’s request for a preliminary injunction, or until April 10, whichever comes first. A U.S. District Court hearing is scheduled for March 13.

324,AMGN,Copy me: Europe shows U.S. a path to cheaper biotech drugs,"LONDON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A revolution is brewing in healthcare with lower-cost copies of complex biotech drugs finally set to reach the United States, nine years after so-called biosimilars were launched in Europe. The potential for copycats to take business from original biotech brands is grabbing investors’ attention and was a key factor in Pfizer’s recent move to buy injectable drugmaker Hospira for about $15 billion. The first approval for a biosimilar in the United States is expected imminently - Zarxio, Novartis’ copy of Amgen’s white blood cell-boosting product Neupogen. But Europe’s experience shows the economics of biosimilars can be unpredictable. The conventional wisdom has been that such copycats, which are still far more difficult to make than standard chemical drugs, will sell at a modest discount of perhaps 20 to 30 percent to the original biotech brands.     Yet when Norway’s drug procurement agency held its latest national hospital tender in January for a biosimilar copy of Johnson & Johnson and Merck’s Remicade it was offered a whopping 69 percent discount to the original brand.      The decision to slash the price was made by Orion Pharma, which distributes the biosimilar known as Remsima in Norway for South Korea’s Celltrion.  Both Remsima and Remicade, which is forecast to be the world’s second-biggest drug this year with sales of more than $9 billion, contain the antibody infliximab for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease. Orion’s move raises questions about the economics of biosimilars and the competitive threat they pose to originator companies - as well as the profit margins they offer to companies making them.  An Orion spokeswoman said the deep discount reflected the “tough pricing competition” in the Nordic region. As an early adopter, Norway is a biosimilars test-bed and Remsima is particularly important as the first copy of an antibody drug, while Norway’s tender system makes it especially price-sensitive. Norwegian doctors have cheered the low price, which frees up resources to treat more patients or pay for other newer medicines, such as cancer immunotherapy. “Our experience has been very good,” said Jorgen Jahnsen, professor of medicine at the University of Oslo, who has treated around 80 patients with Remsima since January 2014 and believes it works just like Remicade. “Other countries may not achieve the same price reduction as in Norway but it can still be significant,” he added. With a population of only 5 million, Norway is a minnow in the global pharmaceuticals marketplace. The megabucks are at stake in larger European nations like Germany, France and Britain, countries where Remsima was launched last month, and in the United States. Express Scripts, the biggest U.S. manager of pharmacy benefits, predicts competition to Remicade and 10 other big biotech drugs could save the United States $250 billion over the next decade. And Steve Miller, the firm’s chief medical officer, reckons that’s conservative, since discounts could be larger than the 30 percent his company has assumed, while new competitors could force originators to discount their prices.   He sees biosimilars acting like conventional generic drugs in driving down costs and creating financial headroom for new medicines. Americans have been using standard generic drugs - exact copies of drugs with expired patents - for 30 years. But the regulatory pathway for biosimilars, which are made in living cells and can never be exact replicas of originals, was only established by healthcare reform in 2010. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is due to give its verdict by March 8 on Zarxio, made by Novartis’ generics unit Sandoz. A green light is expected after it won unanimous backing from an FDA panel in January. The arrival of biosimilars threatens companies heavily reliant on biotech drugs, like AbbVie and Roche, and Citigroup predicts a transfer of at least $110 billion of value from innovator companies to copycat producers in the next decade. Some big pharma companies, like Pfizer and Amgen, are hedging their bets with plans to produce their own biosimilars. The big unknown is how quickly biosimilars will be adopted in clinical practice.  Europe’s experience suggests that take-up hinges on the stance of governments and insurers. A analysis published in October by consultancy IMS Health found biosimilar penetration in Europe ranged from 1 percent to 99 percent across different products and markets, depending on whether countries had prescription quotas for biosimilar drugs, tenders or other mechanisms to encourage use. Key U.S. unknowns include the FDA’s stance on naming biosimilars on pharmacy lists, questions over the extrapolation of a drug’s use to multiple diseases, and the extent to which states will allow any prescription switching. There are also legal challenges, with Amgen seeking an injunction to block the launch of Zarxio, while a crucial FDA panel to consider Remsima was recently postponed. “We hope that there is not a problem with the application,” said Express Scripts’ Miller. “The sooner we can get these great new products to the marketplace, the sooner Americans can enjoy the same savings Europeans have been enjoying.” ",3062015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-biosimilars-insight/copy-me-europe-shows-u-s-a-path-to-cheaper-biotech-drugs-idUSKBN0M20IQ20150306
325,AMGN,U.S. judge rejects Amgen bid to block 'biosimilar' Neupogen,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday denied Amgen Inc’s bid to block the sale of Novartis AG’s recently approved “biosimilar” form of Neupogen, Amgen’s blockbuster drug used to prevent infections in cancer patients.  The drug, Zarxio, contains the same active ingredient as Amgen’s $1.2 billion-a-year Neupogen, and once launched, would become the first biosimilar in the United States. Kristen Davis, a spokeswoman for Amgen, said in an emailed statement that the company plans to appeal the decision by U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg of San Francisco federal court. The judge denied Amgen’s request for a preliminary injunction to prevent Novartis’ Sandoz unit from launching its copycat drug. Swiss drugmaker Novartis previously agreed to delay its U.S. launch until the court’s decision on the preliminary injunction, or until April 10, whichever came first. It was not immediately clear how long Amgen’s appeal would take, or whether Novartis might launch its biosimilar before an appeals court decision is rendered. If Novartis were to initiate such an “at-risk” launch, it might later have to pay costly damages in the event that Amgen’s patent is declared valid and enforceable by the appeals court. “Given the importance of this case for future biosimilars, we agreed with Amgen before this hearing to jointly request expedited review of any appeal to the Federal Circuit,” Novartis said in an emailed statement on Thursday.  Because biosimilars are made in living cells, they are not considered exact duplicates of original brands. Insurers are hoping that biosimilars will be sold for discounts of 40 to 50 percent from the cost of original brands in the United States, but Novartis has not yet disclosed the intended U.S. price for Zarxio. Biosimilars have been on the market since 2006 in Europe.

328,AMGN,U.S. judge rejects Amgen bid to block biosimilar Neupogen,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday denied Amgen Inc’s bid to block the sale of Novartis AG’s  recently approved “biosimilar” form of Neupogen, Amgen’s blockbuster drug used to prevent infections in cancer patients. In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg, of San Francisco federal court, denied Amgen’s request for a preliminary injunction to prevent Novartis’ Sandoz unit from launching its copycat. The drug, Zarxio, contains the same active ingredient as Amgen’s $1.2 billion-a-year Neupogen, and once launched, would become the first approved biosimilar in the United States. Because such drugs are made in living cells, they are not considered exact duplicates of original brands. Insurers are hoping that biosimilars will be sold for discounts of 40 to 50 percent from the cost of origianl brands in the United States, but Novartis has not yet disclosed the intended U.S. cost of Zarxio. Biosimilars been on the market since 2006 in Europe. The U.S. Food and Drug Administation earlier this month approved Zarxio for the same five conditions for which Neupogen is used - among cancer patients undergoing various treatments. Officials at neither Amgen nor Novartis were immediately available for comment.

330,AMGN,U.S. FDA approves Amgen's Corlanor heart failure drug,"(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Wednesday approved Amgen Inc’s Corlanor to treat patients with chronic heart failure, giving the world’s largest biotechnology company its first cardiovascular product. The Food and Drug Administration approved the use of Corlanor (ivabradine) on top of current standard of care beta blockers for patients whose symptoms of heart failure are stable and who have a normal heartbeat and a resting heart rate of at least 70 beats per minute. Chronic heart failure is a common and debilitating condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood throughout the body. “We see in the realm of a million patients in the U.S. who would be in this class and might have a heart rate in the range,” Amgen’s research chief, Sean Harper, said in an interview. Amgen acquired U.S. commercial rights to Corlanor from French drugmaker Servier, which sells the medicine in Europe. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said that long term Corlanor could become a $500 million a year drug for Amgen. Amgen shares rose 1.3 percent in extended trading following the FDA announcement. In a large clinical trial comparing Corlanor with a placebo, the drug significantly reduced the risk of rehospitalization, a common and costly event associated with chronic heart failure.   Corlanor decreases the heart rate by blocking a function of the heart’s natural pacemaker cells. Heart failure patients tend to have an increased heart rate that can prove harmful over time as the muscle works to compensate for diminished pumping ability. “Heart failure is a leading cause of death and disability in adults,” Norman Stockbridge, director of the FDA’s Division of Cardiovascular and Renal Products, said in a statement. “Corlanor ... represents the first approved product in this drug class.”   The FDA decision came after a delay following a request for additional clinical data from Amgen. The most common side effects observed in clinical trial subjects were excessive slowing of the heart rate, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and temporary vision disturbance. Corlanor will be dispensed with a patient medication guide with safety information and instructions for its use, the FDA said.   While Corlanor marks Amgen’s entry into cardiovascular medicine, the company is awaiting an approval decision on a much more high profile heart drug with multibillion-dollar sales potential. An FDA decision is expected by late August on Amgen’s injectable cholesterol fighter Repatha (evolocumab) from a promising new class of drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors.

332,AMGN,"Amgen earnings boosted by higher drug prices, lower R&D;","(Reuters) - Amgen Inc reported higher first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, helped by price increases for its best-selling drugs, as well as lower spending on research and development.  Amgen shares, which rose 1.5 percent in regular trading, were up another 2.3 percent at $172.25 after hours. Excluding one-time items, the Thousand Oaks, California, drugmaker earned $2.48 per share in the quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of $2.10, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The key is that expense reductions were really significantly greater than the street was modeling,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee. “The company has clearly proven that they are serious on cost management.” Amgen, which is entering the cardiovascular sector with new heart failure drug Corlanor and awaits U.S. regulatory approval for cholesterol drug Repatha, expects costs to trend higher for the remainder of the year, said Chief Financial Officer David Meline. He added, however, that overall cost trims are on track, and Amgen raised its full-year outlook for adjusted earnings per share to between $9.35 and $9.65 from a previous range of $9.05 to $9.40. The company also bumped up the lower end of its full-year revenue estimate to $20.9 billion from $20.8 billion, but left the upper end unchanged at $21.3 billion. Analysts had been forecasting 2014 earnings of $9.30 per share on revenue of $20.98 billion. “We have strong momentum as we defend our base business against competition and our transformation efforts are delivering efficiencies and cost savings,” Chief Executive Officer Robert Bradway said, referring to cost containment goals outlined last year. Amgen’s first-quarter revenue rose 11 percent to $5.03 billion, while spending on research and development fell 14 percent to $856 million. The company’s sales of rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel rose 13 percent to $1.17 billion, while sales of white blood cell booster Neulasta rose 4 percent to $1.13 billion - both because of price increases. Year-over-year, Amgen raised its price for Enbrel by 19 percent. Stronger demand pushed sales of multiple myeloma drug Kyprolis up 59 percent to $108 million, and sales of bone drugs Prolia and Xgeva up 29 percent to $612 million.

340,AMGN,Amgen's cancer immunotherapy fails to impress FDA staff reviewers,"(Reuters) - U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff reviewers said an accelerated review of drugmaker Amgen Inc’s skin cancer immunotherapy cannot be considered at this time, citing concerns over the design and results of a key study. The reviewers said in documents made public on Monday that it was unclear whether the treatment, a cancer-killing virus called talimogene laherparepvec or “T-Vec”, improved overall survival, raising questions over its effectiveness. The review comes two days before a panel of FDA advisers votes on whether T-Vec should be approved to treat melanoma. The FDA typically accepts the panel’s recommendations. The panel will also discuss whether the study's main goal of showing an improvement in the durable response rate was meaningful. (1.usa.gov/1djTiQs) T-Vec represents a new class of agent for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and Amgen is looking forward to discussing the data at the joint FDA advisory committee meeting on Wednesday, the company told Reuters. The engineered virus is injected into tumors to kill cancer cells and also primes the immune system to attack the disease. The staff review comes about two months after the FDA pushed back a decision on approving the drug to Oct. 27 from July 28, citing the need for manufacturing data. Melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, is the fifth most common cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that about 73,870 new melanomas will be diagnosed in the United States this year. T-Vec is also being considered for approval in the European Union. Amgen is already testing T-Vec in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s melanoma drug Yervoy and separately with Merck & Co’s experimental immunotherapy, Keytruda.

A lower court judge rejected Amgen’s request for an injunction. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled on Tuesday, however, that the injunction could take effect while Amgen’s appeal is pending. Oral arguments on the appeal have been set for June 3. In a statement, Amgen said it is pleased with the ruling. Novartis said it looks forward to a “prompt resolution” of the appeal so it can launch its drug “in the near future.” The Novartis drug, Zarxio, contains the same active ingredient as Amgen’s $1.2 billion-a-year Neupogen, and once launched, would become the first biosimilar in the United States. Because biosimilars are made in living cells, they are not considered exact duplicates of original brands. Insurers are hoping biosimilars will be sold for discounts of 40 percent to 50 percent from the cost of original brands in the United States. Novartis has not yet disclosed the intended U.S. price for Zarxio. Biosimilars have been on the market since 2006 in Europe. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Zarxio in March for the same five conditions for which Neupogen is used  among cancer patients undergoing various treatments.

345,AMGN,Amgen cholesterol drug could get EU green light this week,"LONDON (Reuters) - Amgen’s new cholesterol drug Repatha could be recommended for approval in Europe as early as this week, putting it ahead in a race with a rival product from Sanofi. Repatha, or evolocumab, belongs to a new class of cholesterol-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors that clinical trials suggest may slash the risks of heart attacks compared to standard treatment alone. According to an agenda posted on the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) website on Tuesday, a committee of experts will consider whether to recommend the medicine at a four-day meeting concluding on May 21. (here) The fact Repatha is being discussed this week does not automatically mean a decision will be taken, since experts may decide they have further questions. The EMA is likely to communicate its decision on this and other new drugs around 1100 GMT on May 22. Recommendations for marketing approval by its Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) are normally endorsed by the European Commission within a couple of months. Amgen’s Repatha is in a race to market with Praluent, which is being developed by Sanofi and its partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Numerous trials have shown that PCSK9 inhibitors significantly lower blood levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol, but widespread use will hinge on whether the drugs are proven to prevent death, heart attacks and other serious heart problems. The experimental drugs are antibodies designed to target the PCSK9 protein that maintains LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream.

346,AMGN,Amgen cholesterol drug could get EU green light this week,"LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - Amgen’s new cholesterol drug Repatha could be recommended for approval in Europe as early as this week, putting it ahead in a race with a rival product from Sanofi. Repatha, or evolocumab, belongs to a new class of cholesterol-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors that clinical trials suggest may slash the risks of heart attacks compared to standard treatment alone. According to an agenda posted on the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) website on Tuesday, a committee of experts will consider whether to recommend the medicine at a four-day meeting concluding on May 21. (here) The fact Repatha is being discussed this week does not automatically mean a decision will be taken, since experts may decide they have further questions. The EMA is likely to communicate its decision on this and other new drugs around 1100 GMT on May 22. Recommendations for marketing approval by its Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) are normally endorsed by the European Commission within a couple of months. Amgen’s Repatha is in a race to market with Praluent, which is being developed by Sanofi and its partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Numerous trials have shown that PCSK9 inhibitors significantly lower blood levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol, but widespread use will hinge on whether the drugs are proven to prevent death, heart attacks and other serious heart problems. The experimental drugs are antibodies designed to target the PCSK9 protein that maintains LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream. They work differently from statins, which block the liver’s production of LDL cholesterol in the first place.

347,AMGN,Amgen ends partnership with AstraZeneca on psoriasis drug,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said it will terminate a collaboration with AstraZeneca Plc to develop a psoriasis drug after it observed suicidal thoughts in the subjects of a trial. Amgen said such safety concerns would likely result in a restrictive label that could limit the number of patients using the late-stage experimental drug, brodalumab.     The company needs drugs like brodalumab at a time when many of its drugs face competition from cheaper copies, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said. Although returning a late-stage drug does not have a major impact, it highlights incremental risks for Amgen, he said. Brodalumab belongs to a class of drugs called IL-17 inhibitors that work by blocking a signaling pathway that plays a key role in inducing and promoting inflammatory diseases. Two late-stage studies evaluating the drug for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis were started in 2014. It was also being tested for treatment of other inflammatory conditions like psoriasis and spondyloarthritis. Research firm ISI Group last year forecast annual peak sales of about $2 billion for the drug. AstraZeneca could decide on the development and marketing of the drug for all territories, except for Japan and certain Asian territories, where Kyowa Hakko Kirin has the rights to it, Amgen said.  Amgen and AstraZeneca partnered in April 2012 to develop and market brodalumab and four other drugs from Amgen’s inflammation portfolio. A number of Amgen drugs, including Neulasta, its immune-system strengthening drug, face the risk of being copied into biosimilars in the next few years. The drug generated sales of $4.59 billion in 2014. Novartis AG’s copy of Amgen’s blockbuster Neupogen won regulatory approval this year but its sale has been blocked by a U.S. court pending an appeal by Amgen.

354,AMGN,Novartis tries to get U.S. ban lifted on sale of Neupogen copycat,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Novartis AG unit Sandoz asked a U.S. appeals court on Wednesday to lift a preliminary injunction barring it from selling its biosimilar Zarxio, a cheaper version of a drug that fends off infections in cancer patients. In October, Amgen Inc, maker of the $1.2 billion-a-year drug Neupogen, sued Sandoz in district court in San Francisco, saying Zarxio infringed the patent on Amgen’s drug. The court refused to grant a preliminary injunction barring the sale of Zarxio while the lawsuit continued, but in May the injunction was granted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The hearing on Wednesday was to discuss if the Federal Circuit’s order would remain.  Zarxio is a biosimilar, which is essentially a close copy of a brand name biologic medicine. Since biosimilars are copies of biologic products, which are made of living cells, they are not considered exact duplicates. Insurers hope they will cost the public 40 percent to 50 percent less than the original brands.  Zarxio would become the first biosimilar sold in the United States.  Much of the discussion on Wednesday focused on whether Sandoz had made appropriate disclosures to Amgen that it planned to bring out a copy of Neupogen, as the law requires.  Sandoz lawyer Deanne Maynard of Morrison Foerster said the company had done so twice, once when it applied for approval for Zarxio from the Food and Drug Administration and again when it received that approval. Judge Raymond Chen, sitting on a panel of three, appeared to discount the notice given at the time of the application. “You don’t have any clue as to whether your application will be approved,” he said. Arguing for Amgen, Nicholas Groombridge of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison said Sandoz had failed to follow regulations about how notice is to be given on the launch of a biosimilar. “Sandoz didn’t follow the rules,” he said.

356,AMGN,FDA panel backs Amgen's cholesterol drug for high-risk patients,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended approval of Amgen Inc’s cholesterol-lowering drug Repatha on Wednesday, but said it should be used only in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease.     The panel voted unanimously to recommend approval of the drug, known also as evolocumab, for patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), a hereditary disorder characterized by high LDL levels that can cause heart attacks in very young people. The panel also recommended approval of Repatha in patients without HoFH who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease and are taking other cholesterol treatments, with a 11-4 vote. The FDA is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so. Repatha is one of a new class of cholesterol-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors. Unlike statins such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor, which are pills, PCSK9 inhibitors are biologic drugs given by injection. They are expected to be far more expensive than statins.  The panel on Tuesday recommended approval for another PCSK9 drug, Praluent, made by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA. The FDA is expected to makes its approval decisions this summer. Repatha is designed to be given in biweekly doses of 140 mg or a monthly dose of 420 mg, on top of statins if patients can tolerate them. Panelists raised questions about what physicians should do if Repatha, combined with statins, were to cause LDL, or so-called bad cholesterol, to drop too low. They fear that if physicians become alarmed by very low LDL levels they could cut back on the patient’s statin, which would not be desirable since there is a large body of data showing that statins reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Panelists were reluctant to recommend the drug for a wider patient population until Amgen completes a large trial to assess whether Repatha’s cholesterol-lowering impact translates into a reduction in cardiovascular risk.  Positive results from the outcomes study could eventually expand use of the medicines. If approved, Praluent and Repatha are expected to generate annual sales of more than $2.5 billion each by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data. However, pharmacy benefit managers, such as Express Scripts and CVS Health, are expected to demand steep discounts from the drugmakers in exchange for favoring use of one medicine or the other as they have with new hepatitis C treatments. Amgen’s shares were flat in after-hours trading after rising 0.5 percent to close at $155.55 on Nasdaq. Regeneron’s shares declined 2.6 percent to close at $512.32 on Wednesday.

363,AMGN,Novartis blocked from selling Neupogen copycat until Sept. 2,"NEW YORK, (Reuters) - Novartis AG must wait until Sept. 2 to sell the first biosimilar drug to be approved in the United States, a copycat version of Amgen Inc’s $1.2 billion-a-year Neupogen, a U.S. appeals court said on Tuesday. The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit Amgen filed last October in federal court in San Francisco in which it accused Novartis’ generic drugs unit Sandoz of infringing on a patent for Neupogen, which boosts white blood cell counts to fight infections in cancer patients. In a 2-1 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the nation’s top patent court, said that federal law governing close copies of biologic drugs required Sandoz to wait six months after the Food and Drug Administration approved the drug to begin to market it. FDA approval for the drug to be sold under the name Zarxio came in March. “Sandoz, therefore, may not market Zarxio before 180 days from March 6, 2015, i.e., September 2, 2015,” the appeals court said. The court said it would maintain the injunction it imposed on marketing Zarxio until that date. “We look forward to launching Zarxio on September 2 as the first U.S. biosimilar,” Novartis spokesman Eric Althoff said in an emailed statement. Amgen declined to comment on whether it planned to appeal the ruling or take further action on its patent infringement case. While biosimilars aim to copy biologic products, which are made inside living cells, they are not considered exact duplicates, such as generic versions of more traditional pills. Insurers hope biosimilars will cost the public 40 percent to 50 percent less than the original brands. Biosimilars, including a version of Neupogen, have been available in Europe since 2006. U.S. health insurers have said biotech drugs with expired patents should also face lower-cost competition in the United States. Numerous drugmakers, including Amgen, are developing biosimilar versions of several multibillion-dollar medicines for rheumatoid arthritis and cancer, with some of those expected to reach the U.S. market by 2017. The appeals court on Tuesday sent the case back down to the district court to consider Amgen’s patent infringement allegations against Sandoz. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a note that he believes “that this ruling could be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.” Amgen shares were off nearly 1 percent at $162.90 on the Nasdaq, while Novartis shares were down about 2 percent at 100.20 Swiss francs in Zurich.

366,AMGN,Amgen wins first approval for new class of cholesterol drugs,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc’s cholesterol fighting drug was approved by the European Commission, giving the keenly anticipated treatment a head start over a rival drug being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA. This is the first approval by any regulator for PCSK9 inhibitors, a new class of biologic drugs that are injected. They are expected to cost much more than statins such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor. The European approval for Repatha will cover patients with a genetic predisposition to high cholesterol and those intolerant of statins or cannot realize enough benefit from them, the biotechnology company said on Tuesday. Amgen did not immediately reveal when the drug would be available or its pricing strategy.  Repatha and its rival drug Praluent are expected to generate global annual sales of more than $2 billion each by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis. Amgen’s drug is designed for biweekly doses of 140 mg or a monthly dose of 420 mg on top of statins if patients can tolerate them. The effect of Repatha on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not yet been determined, Amgen said. A panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended the approval of both drugs last month. The regulator is expected to make its decision this summer.

Procter & Gamble, Facebook and Whole Foods Market all fell after quarterly reports that left investors wanting more. U.S. economic growth accelerated in the June quarter as solid consumer spending offset a drag from weak business spending on equipment, suggesting steady momentum that could bring the Federal Reserve closer to hiking interest rates this year. With a mixed bag of corporate earnings over halfway through second-quarter reporting season and a sharp focus on when the Fed will begin raising interest rates from near zero, investors on Thursday saw few reasons to pay more for shares. “We’ve been stuck in a 3-percent band since almost the beginning of the year,” said Warren West, principal at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia. “There’s nothing motivating investors to push it outside of that in either direction.” The Dow Jones industrial average ended 0.03 percent weaker at 17,745.98, while the S&P; 500 was unchanged at 2,108.63. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.33 percent to 5,128.79. Six of the 10 major S&P; sectors were higher, with the utilities index leading gainers, up 0.72 percent, and the energy index the biggest decliner, down 0.65 percent. Thursday’s GDP report lifted the dollar as some investors bet on a September, rather than December, rate hike. The dollar index rose 0.6 percent to 97.545 after touching its highest in a week. With 64 percent of S&P; 500 companies having reported second-quarter results, analysts expect overall earnings to edge up 1 percent and revenue to decline 3.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Valuations remain a concern. The S&P; 500 is trading near 16.8 times forward 12-month earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data. “Earnings haven’t been great,” said John Canally, investment strategist at LPL Financial. “We are in a slow-growth environment and anything that knocks that down further is not a plus for the market.” After the bell, Expedia jumped 8 percent and Amgen  was 2 percent higher, both posting quarterly reports that pleased investors. LinkedIn’s quarterly revenue beat expectations but its stock was down almost 2 percent after initially jumping around 10 percent. During Thursday’s session, Skechers USA jumped 16 percent as the sports shoe maker and retailer reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly revenue. Procter & Gamble fell 4.0 percent, Facebook dropped 1.8 percent and Whole Foods slumped 11.6 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1.04 to 1. On the Nasdaq, that ratio was 1.10 to 1, favoring advancers. The S&P; 500 saw 35 new 52-week highs and 7 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 70 new highs and 79 new lows.

Excluding special items, Amgen earned $2.57 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 14 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The strong second-quarter performance led the world’s largest biotechnology company to boost 2015 profit and revenue expectations. Amgen now sees adjusted earnings of $9.55 to $9.80 per share, up from its prior view of $9.35 to $9.65. It sees revenue coming in between $21.1 billion and $21.4 billion, up from $20.9 billion to $21.3 billion. “The magnitude of the guidance raise was substantial,” said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt. “The numbers are all very good.” Amgen’s shares rose 1.8 percent in extended trading. The company is expecting U.S. approval of what could be its next big product, a potent new type of cholesterol fighter called Repatha, by late August. It won European approval earlier this month. Regeneron (REGN.O) and Sanofi (SASY.PA) gained U.S. approval of a similar medicine last week. “We are on track to deliver on our long-term objectives for patients and shareholders,” Chief Executive Robert Bradway said in a statement. The company also named to its board industry veteran Fred Hassan, who has a long history of selling large companies, including Pharmacia and Schering-Plough. “They are making headway with expense cuts,” said Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges. “Now it’s really all about the PCSK9 approval and launch,” he said of Repatha. Revenue for the quarter rose to $5.37 billion, exceeding Wall Street forecasts of $5.32 billion. Unfavorable foreign exchange rates due to the strong dollar hurt revenue by 2.5 percentage points, the company said. Amgen gets about 22 percent of its sales from overseas.

Exxon Mobil shares fell 4 percent to $79.52 while Chevron was down 4.2 percent at $89.06 after quarterly profits slumped on falling oil prices. Amgen rose 4.7 percent to $179.64 after the world’s largest biotechnology company reported higher-than-expected second-quarter results. Wall Street opened higher after an historically weak reading of U.S wage growth lent weight to the view that the Fed could delay a rate increase. Positive commentary from the Fed about the economy is seen by many investors as a signal that a rate rise could come as early as September. That has led to a fall in U.S. equities’ share in global portfolios as nervous investors started readying themselves for the first rate rise in almost a decade. U.S. labor costs in the second quarter recorded their smallest increase in 33 years amid tepid gains in the private sector with the Employment Cost Index edging up 0.2 percent, compared with a 0.7 percent increase in the first quarter. The U.S. Federal Reserve has said it will raise rates only when it sees a sustained recovery in the economy. Oil prices fell after OPEC indicated there would be no output cuts despite a huge global oversupply, while copper was lower on lingering worries about demand in top consumer China. A sharp selloff in Chinese shares over the past weeks has stoked concerns about a slowdown in growth in the world’s second-biggest economy.

Seven of the 10 major S&P; 500 sectors were higher with the utilities index’s 1.13 percent rise leading the advancers. The energy index fell 1.9 percent. Wall Street ended flat on Thursday as investors digested ho-hum corporate earnings and new data showed that economic growth accelerated in the second quarter. With more than half of the S&P; 500 companies having reported quarterly results, analysts expect overall earnings to edge up 1 percent and revenue to decline 3.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. “Earnings beating expectations is all well and good but revenue growth hasn’t been encouraging and that’s the real fly in the ointment, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.

377,AMGN,"Amgen pays $71 million to settle Enbrel, Aranesp marketing case","(Reuters) - Amgen Inc has reached a $71 million settlement with 48 U.S. states and the District of Columbia to resolve claims that the biotechnology company promoted its popular Enbrel and Aranesp drugs for uses not approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration. The settlement was announced by several state attorneys general on Tuesday. Enbrel is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, while Aranesp is used to treat certain forms of anemia.  Authorities said Amgen violated state consumer protection laws by marketing both drugs for off-label uses, through its promotion of Enbrel to treat mild plaque psoriasis and Aranesp to treat anemia caused by cancer. The states also said Amgen marketed Aranesp for longer dosing frequencies than the FDA had approved. “Consumers need to have confidence in the accuracy of claims made by pharmaceutical companies,” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement. The $71 million will be distributed among the states. Amgen also agreed to change its marketing practices. Enbrel was Amgen’s top-selling drug in 2014, with $4.69 billion of sales. Aranesp sales totaled $1.93 billion. The Thousand Oaks, California-based company reported overall revenue of $20.06 billion. Tuesday’s settlement came after Amgen agreed in December 2012 to pay $762 million to settle criminal and civil litigation over its marketing of Aranesp, Enbrel and other drugs. It also pleaded guilty to illegally introducing a misbranded drug, Aranesp, into interstate commerce. In a statement on Tuesday, Amgen said it was pleased to resolve the states’ claims.

378,AMGN,"Amgen pays $71 mln to settle Enbrel, Aranesp marketing case","(Reuters) - Amgen Inc has reached a $71 million settlement with 48 U.S. states and the District of Columbia to resolve claims that the biotechnology company promoted its popular Enbrel and Aranesp drugs for uses not approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration. The settlement was announced by several state attorneys general on Tuesday. Enbrel is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, while Aranesp is used to treat certain forms of anemia. Authorities said Amgen violated state consumer protection laws by marketing both drugs for off-label uses, through its promotion of Enbrel to treat mild plaque psoriasis and Aranesp to treat anemia caused by cancer. The states also said Amgen marketed Aranesp for longer dosing frequencies than the FDA had approved. “Consumers need to have confidence in the accuracy of claims made by pharmaceutical companies,” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement. The $71 million will be distributed among the states. Amgen also agreed to change its marketing practices. Enbrel was Amgen’s top-selling drug in 2014, with $4.69 billion of sales. Aranesp sales totaled $1.93 billion. The Thousand Oaks, California-based company reported overall revenue of $20.06 billion. Tuesday’s settlement came after Amgen agreed in December 2012 to pay $762 million to settle criminal and civil litigation over its marketing of Aranesp, Enbrel and other drugs. It also pleaded guilty to illegally introducing a misbranded drug, Aranesp, into interstate commerce. In a statement on Tuesday, Amgen said it was pleased to resolve the states’ claims. It also said company management was “dedicated to fostering a culture of doing the right thing at Amgen in full compliance with the law.” Amgen shares were down $1.85, or 1.1 percent, at $167.94 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq.",8182015,http://www.reuters.com/article/amgen-settlement/amgen-pays-71-mln-to-settle-enbrel-aranesp-marketing-case-idUSL1N10T1D420150818

383,AMGN,Amgen's bone drug succeeds in late-stage study,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said its experimental bone drug was found to be more effective than an already marketed drug in a late-stage study. Amgen’s drug, romosozumab, met the main goal of showing a significant difference over Eli Lilly & Co’s teriparatide in improving total hip bone density by the 12th month in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a condition which causes bones to become weak and brittle leading to an increased risk of fracture. Osteoporosis can occur in both men and women and at any age, but is most common in older women, affecting millions of people in the United States, according to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. The study tested the safety, tolerability and efficacy of romosozumab in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis that had been previously treated with the commonly used therapy, bisphosphonate. More than 5 percent of patients on romosozumab experienced adverse events like common cold, join pain, back pain and headache, Amgen said on Tuesday. Romosozumab is being developed with Belgium’s UCB SA. ",9012015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-amgen-study/amgens-bone-drug-succeeds-in-late-stage-study-idUSKCN0R14PT20150901
384,AMGN,"Novartis, Amgen join forces to fight Alzheimer's and migraine","LONDON (Reuters) - Novartis and Amgen are joining forces in the hunt for an Alzheimer’s treatment, in the latest sign that drugmakers believe an effective therapy for the memory-robbing disease may be within reach. The two companies also plan to collaborate in developing new medicines for migraine. Swiss-based Novartis said on Tuesday the alliance was part of a drive to build up its portfolio in neuroscience, following other deals this summer that have expanded the company’s presence in pain relief and multiple sclerosis. “We’re quite pleased with where we are but we are always looking to continue to grow and build out our pipeline,” Vas Narasimhan, global head of development for Novartis Pharma, told Reuters. The work with U.S. drugmaker Amgen on Alzheimer’s will focus on finding a medicine that can be given orally, rather than as an injection, through the development of so-called BACE inhibitor drugs. BACE inhibitors work by blocking an enzyme called beta secretase that is involved in production of beta-amyloid, a protein that creates brain plaques considered a major cause of Alzheimer’s. Other companies such as Eli Lilly, Biogen and Roche are developing injectable antibody drugs to target beta-amyloid, which have shown some promise in clinical trials. BACE inhibitors would be more convenient, since they are pills, and they also offer an opportunity to intervene earlier in the disease process — but they are further behind in development and have yet to prove themselves in clinical trials.  Novartis’ experimental compound CNP520, currently in early Phase I/IIa studies, will be the lead BACE inhibitor molecule. CNP520 is planned to be included in a prevention study in people with a genetic risk of developing Alzheimer’s, in collaboration with the Banner Alzheimer’s Institute in the United States. The product is relatively late to the party, since Merck already has a BACE inhibitor in Phase III development, with data expected in 2017, while AstraZeneca and Eli Lilly started a large Phase II/III study in December. But Novartis believes CNP520 has a particularly attractive profile and could potentially avoid some of the side effects seen with some other BACE products, such as fluid build-up. Under the Alzheimer’s deal, Amgen will pay an undisclosed upfront payment and milestone payments as well as disproportional research and development costs for a period, followed by a 50/50 cost and profit share arrangement. For migraine, the collaboration will focus on Amgen’s experimental drugs AMG 334, currently in Phase III, and AMG 301, in Phase I. Novartis will have global co-development rights and commercial rights outside North America and Japan.  Novartis will fund disproportional migraine R&D; expenses for a period and will pay Amgen double-digit percentage royalties on sales. The Basel-based drugmaker is probably best known for its cancer medicines, including leukemia treatment Glivec, as well as its big new drug hope Entresto for heart failure. But it also has an important presence in multiple sclerosis (MS) with Gilenya and the company last month moved to expand its MS business by buying the remaining rights to ofatumumab from GlaxoSmithKline. It also gained access to an experimental neuropathic pain drug in June by buying U.S.-Australian biotech firm Spinifex Pharmaceuticals.

386,AMGN,Europe gets Amgen cholesterol drug for 50-60 percent of U.S. price,"LONDON (Reuters) - Amgen is launching its injectable cholesterol drug in Europe at around half the U.S. price, in a move likely to stoke controversy about the way Americans end up paying far more than others for new medicines. Repatha belongs to a potent and expensive new class of drugs for lowering “bad” LDL cholesterol, whose high cost has prompted concerns among healthcare providers and doctors. U.S.-based Amgen said on Tuesday it would charge 340.20 pounds ($521.70) in Britain for a 28-day supply of Repatha, or roughly $6,780 a year, against a list price of $14,100 in the United States, where the drug is also being launched this week. In Austria and Finland, a year’s supply will cost around 7,293 and 7,825 euros ($8,220 and $8,820) respectively. Prices have yet to be determined for other European Union markets.  Repatha is a so-called PCSK9 inhibitor, which is more powerful than cheap statin pills that are effective for most people with high cholesterol. A rival PCSK9 product called Praluent from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi, which has a U.S. price tag of $14,600, is still awaiting final European approval. Both drugs are expected to generate more than $2 billion a year each in sales by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data. The fact that U.S. drug prices are often significantly higher than those in other markets has led to persistent complaints that Americans effectively subsidize the rest of the world in paying for drug development. While PCSK9 drugs could help millions of people who fail to hit their LDL goals on statins, managers of drug benefit plans for U.S. employers and insurers say their high cost could “wreak havoc” on the healthcare system. Manufacturers, however, argue that the drugs can save money by preventing heart attacks and keeping patients out of costly hospital beds. As the medicines consist of antibodies, they are also more expensive to make than conventional statins. The question of how PCSK9 drugs should be prescribed has dominated debate at this week’s annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in London. Many heart specialists believe they will be given sparingly, at least at first. In Europe, in particular, demand is likely to be curbed by budget-conscious governments, many of which have set up healthcare cost agencies to assess new drug use. In Britain, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is expected to issue guidance next April on whether Repatha should be used on the state health service. A desire by companies to ensure products are recommended by such agencies is one reason why drug prices are often set lower in Europe than in the United States. An Amgen spokeswoman said prices were set to reflect “the unique healthcare environment and marketplace” of different countries. Lars Ryden, a cardiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said he expected PCSK9 costs would come down within a couple of years as other companies, like Pfizer, enter the market. But for the time being authorities will be cautious. “I’m quite sure that in Sweden the use will be very selective,” he told Reuters. Austrian cardiologist Heinz Drexel said the new drugs were likely to be reserved at first mainly for patients with severe familial high cholesterol or those suffering successive heart attacks. Among his acute coronary syndrome patients, Drexel said he expected to give PCSK9 injections to only a “single digit percent” over the coming year. However, usage could pick up once long-term studies testing efficacy in preventing heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular deaths report results in 2017. Currently, Repatha and Praluent are given once every two weeks, although Amgen plans to offer a once-monthly option next year. But the ESC congress also saw promising early results with a new PCSK9 drug that could be given once every three to six months.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in July said Novartis could begin to market its biosimilar drug, to be sold under the name Zarxio, after Sept. 2. Amgen had sought an injunction while both companies ask the court to clarify federal regulations on when close copies of biologic medicines may be brought to market. The appeals court, based in Washington, gave no reasons for rejecting Amgen’s bid. Novartis’s generic drugs unit, Sandoz, has said in court papers that it can begin to market Zarxio commercially on Thursday. Sandoz said it welcomed Wednesday’s decision but would not give further details on an exact launch date. Amgen spokeswoman Kelley Davenport said the company was proud of helping millions of patients over the past 24 years with Neupogen. She said Amgen “will utilize our capabilities to compete effectively.” Amgen sued Sandoz last October, alleging infringement of a patent on Neupogen, its $1.2 billion-a-year medicine that boosts white blood cell counts to fight infections in cancer patients. While biosimilars aim to copy biologic products, which are made inside living cells, they are not considered exact duplicates, such as generic versions of more traditional pills. Insurers hope biosimilars will cost the public 40 percent to 50 percent less than the original brands. Siegmund Gutman, an attorney at Proskauer Rose in Los Angeles, who has followed the case but was not involved, said Sandoz has not offered pricing information on Zarxio and any reduction in cost to patients remains uncertain. “The marketplace is a complicated environment.

394,AMGN,UPDATE 3-Novartis launches first U.S. 'biosimilar' drug at 15 pct discount,"* Cheaper copies of biotech drugs promise big savings * Zarxio priced at 15 pct less than Amgen’s Neupogen * Amgen unsuccessful in attempt to block Zarxio launch   (Adds Amgen comment) By Ben Hirschler and Michael Shields LONDON/ZURICH, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Novartis kicked off a new era in U.S. medicine on Thursday with the launch of the first “biosimilar” copy of a biotechnology drug approved in the United States, at a discount of 15 percent to the original. The Swiss drugmaker’s generics unit Sandoz said Zarxio, its form of Amgen’s white blood cell-boosting product Neupogen, would increase access to an important treatment by offering a “high-quality, more affordable version”. U.S. biotech group Amgen had tried to stop the sale of Zarxio, also known as filgrastim-sndz, but the Washington-based appeals court rejected its attempt to block the launch. The potential for copycats to take business from original biotech drug brands is increasingly grabbing investors’ attention, although uncertainties remain as to how quickly so-called biosimilars will win business. Biosimilars have been on the market in Europe since 2006. However, the U.S. regulatory pathway for biosimilars, which are made in living cells and can never be exact replicas of originals, was only established by a healthcare reform in 2010. Amgen said it intended to compete effectively with the new product and would base promotion on its 24 years of clinical experience with Neupogen. “All biologics, including biosimilars, are highly complex molecules and each manufacturer’s product will be distinct,” the U.S. drugmaker said in a statement. The arrival of biosimilars threatens companies heavily reliant on biotech drugs, such as Amgen, AbbVie and Roche, and Citigroup analysts have predicted a transfer of at least $110 billion of value from innovator companies to copycat producers in the next decade. As a result, investors have been watching the Zarxio case closely, since it could determine the way in which a wave of other lower-cost biosimilars are received by regulators, courts and healthcare providers. Novartis said the U.S. wholesale list price for a 300 microgram syringe of Zarxio was $275.66, with the 480 mcg version costing $438.98. Neupogen costs $324.30 and $516.45 for the same syringe formulations, according to Amgen. The 15 percent discount is the same price gap set when Zarxio was launched in Europe in 2009, although the discount in Europe has since widened to an average of around 20 to 30 percent. Insurers hope biosimilars will eventually cost the public 40 percent to 50 percent less than the original brands. Neupogen is a $1.2 billion-a-year medicine for Amgen that boosts white blood cell counts to fight infections in cancer patients. The majority of its sales are generated in the United States. An even bigger prize lies in the development of copies of multibillion-dollar antibody drugs for the treatment of diseases like cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, where Sandoz and rivals are also working to bring products to market. Express Scripts, the largest manager of drug benefit plans for U.S. employers and insurers, has estimated the United States could save $250 billion between 2014 and 2024 if 11 of the likeliest biosimilars reach the market.

395,AMGN,Amgen seeks FDA approval for monthly dosing option for Repatha,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said on Friday it had asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve a monthly single-dosing option for its recently approved cholesterol drug, Repatha. The FDA approved Repatha - one of two expensive treatments in a new class of injectable “bad cholesterol”-lowering drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors - in late August. A similar drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA, called Praluent, was approved in July. Repatha is approved for patients with hereditary forms of high cholesterol - heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and a rarer homozygous (HoFH) form of the condition, in addition to those with cardiovascular disease. It is given as a 140 mg injection every other week or as a monthly injection of 420 mg, which is recommended for HoFH patients, the company said. At the time of approval, Amgen had said it planned to make the monthly dosing option available next year.  Praluent, which is given every other week by injection in doses of 75 mg or 150 mg. Praluent has a U.S. price of $14,600 for a year of treatment, while Repatha costs about $14,100. Amgen’s drug is being launched in Europe at around half the U.S. price. In Europe, demand is expected to be limited by budget-conscious governments, many of which have set up healthcare-cost agencies to assess new drugs. Companies often set prices lower to ensure their products are recommended by these agencies. In the United States, CVS Health Corp and other pharmacy benefit managers are unhappy about the cost of the PCSK9s compared to older cholesterol fighters such as statins, which are available as generics for less than $50 a month. Amgen, Regeneron and Sanofi have been accused of setting prices that could wreak havoc on the U.S. healthcare system and limit patient use. But the companies argue that the drugs are more expensive to make and will reduce overall hospital costs because they could prevent heart attacks. Depending on how they are used, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) estimates that between 3.5 million and 15 million Americans could be eligible for treatment.

399,AMGN,SEC drops Onyx insider trading lawsuit against Dubai men,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday dismissed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit accusing two Dubai men of insider trading in Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc while the cancer drugmaker was mulling a takeover bid by Amgen Inc. U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken in Manhattan granted the SEC’s request to end its two-year-old case against Dhia Jafar and Omar Nabulsi without prejudice, and lift a $2.55 million asset freeze on two accounts they held at Citigroup. The SEC did not explain why it wanted the dismissal, which it requested in a Tuesday court filing. “It came out of the blue,” Patrick Smith, a lawyer for the defendants, said in an interview. “They called us and said they wanted to dismiss the case. I think it is an admission on their part that they had no evidence that my clients committed insider trading. It’s a shame because it was a long time coming.” Oetken in June rejected the defendants’ bid to dismiss the case in light of a December 2014 decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that narrowed the definition of insider trading. The judge nonetheless said that decision, known as the Newman case, “may make it more difficult” for the SEC to prevail against Jafar and Nabulsi. SEC spokeswoman Judith Burns declined to comment. Jafar’s and Nabulsi’s accounts were frozen in July 2013, soon after the SEC uncovered what it called suspicious trading in Onyx call options on June 26 and 28 of that year. Onyx on June 30 said it rejected an unsolicited $10 billion bid from Amgen, and would put itself up for sale. Its shares soared more than 51 percent the next day. Onyx was ultimately bought by Amgen. Jafar and Nabulsi have maintained that they did nothing wrong, and had frequently traded in stock options. Smith said the Newman decision was “helpful,” but that the SEC “never had a tipper” or evidence that his clients received inside information. “On one level my clients are pleased the case is over, but they still wonder how they’re going to get their reputations back,” he said.

409,AMGN,Amgen's leukemia drug gets conditional European approval,"(Reuters) - European health regulators on Friday conditionally approved Amgen Inc’s rare blood cancer drug, Blincyto, which is one of the world’s most expensive cancer treatments. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December approved Blincyto for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which has few treatment options once a patient has relapsed. Blincyto is a so-called bispecific antibody, an emerging class of drugs that could prove more potent than conventional antibodies – the mainstay treatment for many forms of cancers. An estimated 6,250 Americans, mostly children, will be diagnosed with ALL this year and 1,450 of them will succumb to the disease, according to the American Cancer Society. The European Medicines Agency conditionally approves a drug when it is meant for a severely debilitating disease with few or no treatment options, and when the benefits of its immediate availability outweigh the risks. The conditional approval is granted despite the lack of complete trial data and is renewed annually until the EMA is satisfied with the complete data to fully approve the drug. Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology company, expects final European approval for Blincyto in the coming months. The drug, which it got through the acquisition of biotechnology company Micromet in 2012, costs about $178,000 for two courses of treatment. Pharmaceutical companies have recently come under fire over high prices for specialty drugs and U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton unveiled a plan on Wednesday to address “price gouging”. European regulators on Friday also backed Amgen’s multiple myeloma drug, Kyprolis, for its use in combination with two other drugs in previously-treated patients.  The blood cancer drug is being used as a monotherapy in the United States since 2012, and in July this year was cleared by the FDA to be used in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone.

413,AMGN,U.S. biotech bloodbath hits hedge funds but some bargains emerge,"Sept 29 (Reuters) - A seven-day selloff of U.S. biotechnology stocks has hit sector investors - especially hedge funds - hard. But some managers say it was overdone and are already eyeing bargains such as Gilead Sciences Inc and Amgen Inc. The Nasdaq Biotechnology index has fallen 18.7 percent over the last seven sessions as investors took flight after Hillary Clinton, front-runner to be the Democratic nominee in next year’s U.S. presidential election, vowed on Sept. 21 to take steps to curb high drug prices. Since its July 20 high, the index has fallen around 27 percent. The selloff was exacerbated by general market volatility as investors have been grappling with uncertainty about when policy makers will raise U.S. interest rates and concerns over the global economy. Biotech stocks, which had risen 31 percent this year to their July high after annual increases for the last six years, were also in sellers’ sights because they had become richly valued. And the selling was intensified as investment managers did not want to issue third quarter reports showing big holdings in a beaten-down sector. “What you’re seeing is that generalist money is getting very worried and thinking that maybe the healthcare trade is over and they’re rotating into something else,” said John Fraunces, co-portfolio manager of the $137 million Turner Medical Sciences Long-Short fund in Berwyn, Pennsylvania. Health-focused hedge funds including Baker Brothers Advisors, Healthcor Management, Palo Alto Investors, and Deerfield Management are each nursing losses of more than 10 percent for September based on their publicly disclosed portfolio at the end of June, data calculated by industry tracking firm Symmetric IO show. Symetric data points to broad holdings of specialty biopharmaceutical company Horizon Pharma, which has tumbled 47.3 percent in the last 7 days and which was listed in six hedge fund portfolios. The stock was a big holding for Deerfield, which manages $7.5 billion, for Healthcor, which oversees $2.6 billion, and for Broadfin Capital, which has held the stock for nearly two years. Horizon Pharma’s losses also weighed on Iguana Healthcare Management. At the same time, a sharp drop in pharmaceutical company Valeant  weighed on a number of hedge funds, including prominent activists Pershing Square Capital Management and Jana Partners. A lot of selling took place in healthcare ETFs such as the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology EFT, which fell almost 19 percent in the last seven days with an average daily trading volume that was 1.6 times higher than its 50 day average. In the options market, most of the activity was still on the side of expecting further declines, with protective puts outweighing other biotech index trades. But some traders appear to have been snapping up call options in hopes for a sharp rebound, said Jim Smith, options strategist at OTR Global. “People who are in the sector are looking for hedges and people who are not in it are looking for bargains,” he said. Fraunces has been shorting the ETF, but now he and other investors are already eyeing bargains in the sector. He has been moving money to companies including Horizon Pharmaceuticals, one of the biggest casualties in the biotech sell-off. Some big name stocks, such as Gilead, Amgen, Biogen Inc  and Celgene Corp have sold off sharply enough to make their valuations attractive, according to several investors. Gilead’s forward valuation of 8.1 is now less than half its 10-year median of 16.7 and its competitors’ average valuations of 14.4. Amgen’s forward P/E is 12.5 compared with an average valuation of 16 for its peers. Meanwhile the S&P; 500’s forward P/E was 15.4 on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters data. “That’s pretty unusual because the absolute growth rate for those companies is two to three times higher than the S&P;,” said Sven Borho, founding general partner and fund manager at health science investment specialist Orbimed Advisors LLC, in New York. High valuations prompted Seattle-based Smead Capital Management to cut biotech and pharma holdings in its $1.2 billion Smead Value Investor fund in the last 18 months to 16.5 percent from 29 percent, Tony Scherrer, director of research said. But Scherrer, now interested in Amgen and Gilead, described the last week’s ETF trading as “throwing out the baby with the bathwater.”   (Reporting by Sinead Carew; Additional reporting by Svea Herbst, David Randall and Saqib Ahmed; Editing by Frances Kerry)",9292015,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-biotech/u-s-biotech-bloodbath-hits-hedge-funds-but-some-bargains-emerge-idUSL1N11Z26Q20150929
414,AMGN,Pacific trade deal adds to U.S. price quandary for biotech drugs,"NEW YORK/ATLANTA, Oct 5 (Reuters) - The Pacific trade deal agreed on Monday, which grants biotechnology drug producers less protection than offered by the United States, could put more downward pressures on the costly drugs’ pricing in the industry’s most lucrative market. The United States and 11 trading partners, including Mexico, Japan, Canada and Australia, wrapped up five years of talks after securing a compromise on protection for biotech drugs that would help determine when less expensive versions known as biosimilars can enter the market. [ID: nL3N1252R6] The terms of the Trans-Pacific Partnership give drugmakers at least five and potentially up to eight years of protection of data needed to produce biosimilar medicines. Countries can sign on for a minimum of five years of data exclusivity that with added time for regulatory processes, would in effect provide a “comparable outcome” to an eight-year time frame. The agreement falls far short of the 12 years of data protection enforced in the United States and which U.S. lobby groups representing biotech and pharmaceutical companies from Amgen Inc to Pfizer Inc sought to extend to other nations. The United States could still maintain 12 years in its own market, since the trade deal language only sets minimum standards. Over time, however, the longer protection period compared with its trading partners could come under pressure at home, where anger over rising costs of medicines is growing among doctors, patients and some lawmakers. “If you see too much of a price discrepancy (between the United States and trade partners), at some point you’re going to see a push back,” said Steve Brozak, president of WBB Securities which focuses on smaller biotechs. U.S. lobbies representing pharmaceutical and biotech companies voiced their disappointment that the negotiators failed to uphold the 12-year period as an international standard. “This term was not a random number, but the result of a long debate in Congress, which determined that this period of time captured the appropriate balance that stimulated research but gave access to biosimilars in a timely manner,” Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America CEO John Castellani said. Early launch of biosimilars outside the United States could  hit overseas sales of the larger biotechs, such as Amgen, Celgene and Biogen, and pharmaceutical companies with important biotech drugs, such as new cancer treatments from Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb . Many of those companies are hedging their bets by developing their own biosimilars of rivals’ drugs, including copycat versions of AbbVie’s rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, the world’s top-selling medicine which is on track for $14 billion in sales this year. The Nasdaq Biotech Index, which had been up earlier on Monday, turned negative and was off about 0.7 percent. However, the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, which supports the development of biosimilars, said the agreement hit the right balance between innovation and saving lives. As the cost of biotech medicines for cancer and other diseases has surged to more than $100,000 per treatment regimen, U.S. health insurers, medical societies and politicians are pushing for greater discounts and the faster introduction of competing treatments. Biologics, which are made from living cells and therefore tougher to replicate than conventional pharmaceuticals, now account for about one-quarter of U.S. spending on drugs. That amounted to $93 billion in 2013, according to consultancy EY. They are expected to contribute to a surge in costs over the next decade as new, and far more expensive, treatments reach the market. As a result, some U.S. consumer advocates sided with countries looking to significantly shorten data protection, beyond the de-facto eight year period and the 12-year protection advocated by the industry. Such critics say it protects the interests of the drug industry by making it almost impossible for Congress to set a shorter period even if it wanted to do so because the trade agreement would prevent this. “Why should we pay more than the rest of the world?,” said KJ Hertz, analyst with AARP, which lobbies on behalf of U.S. seniors. AARP sided with a 5-year minimum proposed by Australia and others. “We want an agreement that leaves flexibility to make changes to U.S. law.” Data protection, which refers to the information on a new biotech drug that is submitted to regulators, differs from traditional patent protection, which typically runs 20 years. Since it is impossible to produce exact copies of biotech drugs, drugmakers fear that their original patents could be circumvented with access to the data on the molecules and other scientific research needed to produce them. WBB Securities’ Brozak said one of the biggest losers from the new trade pact could be smaller biotechs, many of which do not yet have revenue but are developing the breakthrough medicines of the future. For example, the work of smaller company Pharmasset led to the development of the first drug that cured hepatitis C in nearly all patients. Gilead Sciences Inc bought the company in 2012 and has since seen billions of dollars in sales for the drug. But Gilead may never have made the bet if it could not enjoy a long enough period of protection, Brozak argues. “The period of exclusivity draws the investors to these companies,” said Brozak. “You could see material harm to people making investment decisions.”   (Additional reporting by Kevin Krolick in Atlanta, Toni Clarke in Washington and Caroline Humer in New York; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Tomasz Janowski)",10052015,http://www.reuters.com/article/trade-tpp-biotech/pacific-trade-deal-adds-to-u-s-price-quandary-for-biotech-drugs-idUSL1N1251OI20151005

416,AMGN,Merck cholesterol drug's odds dim after Lilly failure,"Oct 12 (Reuters) - The odds that Merck & Co’s  high-stakes cholesterol drug will succeed have dropped dramatically after Eli Lilly and Co said its similar medicine failed to reduce heart attacks and strokes, top U.S. heart doctors said. Lilly on Monday said it was halting a 12,000-patient study of its drug, evacetrapib, an oral medication. In earlier studies, the treatment cut “bad” LDL cholesterol by 30 to 35 percent and doubled the levels of “good” LDL cholesterol. But the influence on cholesterol levels did not ultimately improve patients’ health, dashing hopes for this approach to treating heart disease. Merck’s anacetrapib is now the only drug in a novel class known as CETP inhibitors that remains in late-stage trials. Data from a 30,000-patient study is expected by 2017 to show whether it reduces the incidence of heart attack and strokes. Wall Street analysts have estimated the drug could reap eventual annual sales of up to $10 billion, if approved. But with the outlook dimmed for CETP inhibitors, Wall Street analysts on Monday predicted a boost to a competing class of drugs just approved for the U.S. market that work by sharply lowering LDL cholesterol. Shares in Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals rose on expectations the Lilly decision removed a competitive threat to sales of their injectable drugs, which block a protein called PCSK9. “CETP inhibitors as legitimate drug targets are dead as of today,” said Dr. P.K. Shah, director of atherosclerosis research at Cedars-Sinai Heart Center in Los Angeles, referring to Lilly’s setback. “For cardiologists looking for heart protection, these drugs were a dream, but they haven’t come true.” Dr. Steve Nissen, head of cardiology for the Cleveland Clinic, noted that Lilly’s failure follows the demise of two other high-profile drugs in the same class. Pfizer’s Inc’s  torcetrapib was discontinued in 2006 due to safety worries, while Roche Holding AG’s dalcetrapib was terminated in 2012 for lack of benefit. “In baseball you don’t get four strikes,” he said of prospects for Merck’s candidate. Nissen was chairman of the halted Lilly study, which involved trials at 540 sites in 37 countries. Merck, in an emailed statement, said it looks forward to better understanding Lilly’s decision to pull the plug on evacetrapib, but remains confident in its own drug’s potential success. CETP inhibitors block a protein that transfers HDL cholesterol to LDL cholesterol, resulting in higher levels of HDL and lower LDL levels. Statins, by contrast, work by reducing the liver’s production of cholesterol. Amgen and Regeneron’s treatments work by blocking a protein named PSCK9 whose normal function in the body is to maximize the presence of LDL cholesterol that enters the bloodstream. However, investors are still waiting for proof that PCSK9 inhibitors actually reduce heart attacks and strokes, and don’t just reduce cholesterol. Data from such an “outcomes” trial for Regeneron’s Praluent are expected by late 2016, while those from Repatha’s trial are due in 2017. Dr. Allen Taylor, chief of cardiology at MedStar Heart and Vascular Institute in Washington, D.C., said it would be unwise to assume the PCSK9 inhibitors are heart-protective just because they slash LDL levels. “Until you see the trial results, all bets are off,” he said. Should Merck’s own outcomes data for anacetrapib prove positive, the pill could be a much preferred method for patients over the injections required for PCSK9 treatments. Lilly shares closed down 7.8 percent on Monday. Merck slipped 0.5 percent. Regeneron shares jumped 4.5 percent, while its PCSK9 partner, Sanofi SA, rose 1.3 percent in Paris. Amgen shares rose 2.4 percent.

417,AMGN,"U.S. oncology group rates blood cancer regimens, including cost","Oct 16 (Reuters) - The most influential source for U.S. oncology treatment guidelines on Friday unveiled ratings aimed at helping doctors and patients assess the costs versus benefits of current therapies for two types of blood cancer. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), a nonprofit alliance of 26 leading cancer centers, said its new “Evidence Blocks” for multiple myeloma and chronic myelogenous leukemia are the first in a series that by the end of next year will encompass all oncology therapies, other than surgery or radiation. The blocks give each therapy a score of between one and five in five categories: efficacy, safety, quality and consistency of evidence and affordability. They will supplement NCCN’s widely followed guidelines for oncology care. In examples released on Friday, NCCN rated primary treatments for CML: Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Sprycel, and Novartis AG’s Gleevec and Tasigna. Ratings for all three were nearly identical: highly effective and very expensive. For newly diagnosed myeloma patients eligible for a stem cell transplant, NCCN lists six “preferred” regimens, four of which contain Takeda Pharmaceutical Co’s Velcade and various chemotherapies, one that includes Celgene Corp’s  Revlimid and another that combines Velcade and Revlimid. The Velcade/Revlimid/dexamethasone regimen is rated as the most effective and the most expensive. NCCN lists Amgen Inc’s Kyprolis, in combination with Revlimid and dexamethasone, as another upfront therapy for myeloma. The Kyprolis regimen was rated highly effective, mildly toxic, average in terms of evidence, mainly consistent in terms of trial data, and very expensive. Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer that develops in the bone marrow, while CML starts in certain blood-forming cells of the bone marrow. Multiple myeloma is diagnosed in about 27,000 Americans each year, and CML is occurs in about 7,000, according to the American Cancer Society.

418,AMGN,Amgen wins EU green light for first virus-based cancer drug,"LONDON (Reuters) - A first-in-class drug from Amgen based on a tumour-killing virus was given a green light by European regulators on Friday, paving the way for its approval within a couple of months. The decision is a further milestone for a technology that has long fascinated scientists but has previously proved difficult to harness. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said its experts had recommended approval of Imlygic, also known as talimogene laherparepvec or “T-Vec”, for treating melanoma, making it another option among several new drugs for the most deadly form of skin cancer. “Viral immunotherapy represents a completely new way of treating cancer, so it’s extremely exciting to see T-Vec become the first treatment of this type to gain the green light from European regulators,” said Paul Workman, Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London. The drug is recommended for treating melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery and has spread without affecting internal organs.  Imlygic uses a herpes simplex virus, the type that causes cold sores, which has been modified to only infect cancer cells. It is injected directly into tumours where it replicates and causes cancer cells to rupture and die, also stimulating a system-wide immune response. Until three years ago, chemotherapy was the only available treatment for patients whose melanoma had spread. But recently there have been a number of new treatments, including immunotherapies, BRAF V600 inhibitors and MEK inhibitors. Despite this progress, the EMA said there was still a need for new treatments with acceptable safety profiles to continue to improve the outlook for patients. Amgen said melanoma remained one of the most difficult-to-treat cancers, often requiring the use of multiple treatments. In clinical tests, Imlygic has shrunk tumours but it has not yet been shown to extend lives. “Exploratory analysis in these patients suggested improvements in survival in patients treated with Imlygic, however this is not yet fully clear,” the EMA said. “Imlygic has also not been compared with other recently approved medicines for melanoma, which have shown beneficial effects on survival.”  Amgen’s product was recommended by an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April and the U.S. agency is due to give its verdict on whether to approve the medicine by Oct. 27. Amgen secured rights to Imlygic after buying BioVex for up to $1 billion in 2011, marking a notable bet on so-called oncolytic virus technology in the wake of earlier disappointments. Onyx Pharmaceuticals had a big setback in the field in 2003 with a product called ONYX-015, a modified common cold virus.

421,AMGN,FDA approves Amgen's injected immunotherapy for melanoma,"(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Tuesday approved Amgen Inc’s novel cancer immunotherapy for injection into melanoma lesions and lymph nodes of patients with the deadliest form of skin cancer that returns after initial surgery. The drug, to be sold under the brand name Imlygic, is an engineered version of a herpes virus that kills cancer cells when injected directly into cancerous lesions on or under the skin, destroying them from the inside, while also priming the immune system to attack the disease. The Food and Drug Administration said Imlygic, known chemically as talimogene laherparepvec, or T-Vec, is the first oncolytic virus therapy to be approved in the United States. It is awaiting European approval after receiving a favorable recommendation from regulators there. Amgen said it expects the average cost of Imlygic therapy to be about $65,000, and that it will be available to U.S. patients within a week. The company said it is studying the drug in combination with other immunotherapies in advanced melanoma and other solid tumor cancers. This represents the sixth U.S. approval for Amgen in the last 12 months, including another cancer drug, Blincyto, and its potent new cholesterol fighter Repatha. The U.S. Imlygic approval was widely expected after an advisory panel to the FDA in April voted 22-1 to support its approval, despite a lack of definitive overall survival data on the treatment. “T-Vec represents an important milestone in using viruses as the vehicle to stimulate immune response and fight cancer,” Tim Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation, said in a statement. “Despite remarkable advances in the past four years, the majority of patients with metastatic melanoma still die from this cancer.”  Wall Street analysts expect the drug to be a relatively small product for the world’s largest biotechnology company. Thomson Reuters Cortellis forecast peak sales of $387.5 million by 2020. The Imlygic label contains warnings that it should not be used by pregnant patients or anyone with a compromised immune system. It also notes that accidental exposure to the drug could lead to transmission of herpetic infection.

427,AMGN,UK cost watchdog turns down Amgen's new cholesterol drug,"LONDON (Reuters) - Amgen’s new injectable cholesterol drug Repatha has been turned down for use on Britain’s state health service, underscoring a worldwide debate about the value of such pricey medicines. Repatha belongs to a potent new class of drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors that are extremely effective at lowering “bad” LDL cholesterol. But the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) cost watchdog said on Wednesday the question as to whether this would reduce heart attacks and strokes remained unanswered, given a lack of long-term clinical outcomes studies. NICE, which decides if treatments should be paid for on the National Health Service (NHS), also said in its draft guidance that analyses presented by Amgen had limitations that “called into question the reliability of the cost-effectiveness results”. Amgen said it was disappointed by the decision, since the evidence “strongly indicates that high cholesterol is linked to heart attacks and strokes”, and it aimed to provide more data and analyses to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of Repatha. The British list price for Repatha is 4,448.60 pounds ($6,769) for a year’s treatment, which is less than half the U.S. list price of more than $14,000. NICE said Amgen had also offered the NHS a further undisclosed discount. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi have a rival product called Praluent that has not yet been assessed by NICE.

430,AMGN,Novartis biosimilar takes aim at Amgen drug Neulasta,"ZURICH (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has accepted Novartis unit Sandoz’s submission for approval of a biosimilar version of U.S.-based Amgen’s Neulasta drug that fights infections in cancer patients, the Swiss group said on Wednesday. It marks the company’s third biosimilar filing in the United States and the second of 10 regulatory filings planned over the next three years, it said in a statement.  Sandoz said it would seek the same indication as Neulasta, whose generic name is pegfilgrastim.  Amgen’s third-quarter results last month showed sales of Neulasta up 6 percent to $1.26 billion, topping expectations of $1.17 billion. The FDA last month accepted Sandoz’s regulatory submission for approval of a biosimilar copy of Amgen’s blockbuster Enbrel drug. Biosimilars aim to copy biologic products, which are made inside living cells, but they can never be exact duplicates, so biosimilar manufacturers need to conduct clinical trials to show their products work as intended. “Sandoz believes that the totality of evidence in its submission, including three pivotal clinical studies, will demonstrate that the proposed biosimilar is highly similar to the reference product,” it said on Wednesday. Novartis in September launched the first biosimilar drug in the United States after a U.S. appeals court declined to stop the sale of the company’s copycat version of Amgen’s blockbuster cancer drug Neupogen. Insurers and government healthcare systems hope biosimilars will cost the public 40 percent to 50 percent less than the original drugs and experience in Europe suggests that steep discounts are being offered in some markets. The potential for biosimilars to take a large slice of the market is grabbing the attention of both healthcare providers, who see big budget savings, and investors, worried about the impact on the profits of companies making original products.

432,AMGN,Amgen files for U.S. approval of biosimilar to Humira,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc on Wednesday said it filed with U.S. health regulators seeking approval to sell its first biosimilar drug, which would be a less expensive alternative to AbbVie’s Humira, the world’s top-selling prescription medicine. Amgen said its drug, ABP 501, has demonstrated clinical equivalence and comparable safety to Humira (adalimumab) in late stage clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis and the skin condition plaque psoriasis. Data to support the switching of patients from Humira to  ABP 501 was included in the submission to regulators, Amgen said.  Several companies developing biosimilars are targeting Humira, which is still growing with annual sales approaching $13 billion. Amgen said it believes it is the first to seek approval of a Humira biosimilar with the Food and Drug Administration using the new approval pathway outlined by the agency. Unlike cheap generic versions of traditional chemical drugs, biotech medicines are made from living cells and cannot be exactly copied, thus the term biosimilar, and the need to demonstrate clinical equivalence with the target biologic treatment. Because they are far more complicated to produce, biosimilars will not offer the huge discounts of standard generics, but they are still expected to eventually generate billions of dollars in healthcare savings. “Amgen’s branded biologic medicines and biosimilars are developed and manufactured according to the same high standards, and we are committed to delivering high-quality medicines to patients with serious inflammatory diseases,” Amgen research chief Sean Harper said in a statement. The first biosimilar approved in the United States earlier this year is a cheaper version of Amgen’s infection-fighting white blood cell booster Neupogen, produced by Swiss drugmaker Novartis. While several other Amgen products are likely to eventually face competition from less expensive versions, the world’s largest biotechnology company has ambitious plans to profit from the new market for biosimilars as well. The company last year said it was developing biosimilars of nine blockbuster medicines, with plans to begin launches in 2017.

The drug, CHS-0214, was found to be as effective as Enbrel in rheumatoid arthritis patients, with no clinically meaningful differences in terms of its safety, the companies said on Monday. Enbrel, which raked in U.S. sales of $1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2015, is Amgen’s best-selling drug, making it a lucrative option for companies developing biosimilars. Biosimilars are copies of biotech drugs and their potential to take business from companies making the original, expensive product is being monitored closely by investors. Coherus specializes in developing biosimilars and has a number of copycat drugs under development, including of Amgen’s Neulasta and AbbVie Inc’s Humira. Novartis AG’s Sandoz unit is also developing a  biosimilar of Enbrel, while India’s Cipla Ltd launched its own copy of the drug, called Etacept, in 2013. Enbrel’s patents for Europe expired in February last year and its U.S. patents are set to expire in 2028.

440,AMGN,U.S. patent office rules against Amgen Humira challenge,"(Reuters) - U.S. patent officials on Thursday denied petitions by Amgen to review two formulation patents on AbbVie’s Humira, a potential setback in Amgen efforts to market a biosimilar version of the world’s top-selling prescription medicine. In June, Amgen, the world’s biggest biotechnology company, asked the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the review, arguing that the patents should not have been granted in the first place for Humira, a rheumatoid arthritis drug with annual sales approaching $14 billion. In declining to review the patents, the agency said “we determine, based on the Petition and the accompanying evidence, that Amgen has not shown a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on any of its challenges.” Amgen in November became the first company to file with U.S. health regulators seeking approval to sell a less expensive biosimilar version of the blockbuster medicine. Several companies are also developing biosimilar version of Humira. Amgen has said it expects the first of its several biosimilars in development to reach the market between 2017 and 2019. The company did not have an immediate comment on the ruling. AbbVie this week said it expects Humira sales to reach $18 billion by 2020. Based on its various patents, AbbVie said it does not expect competition from biosimilars until 2022.

443,AMGN,U.S. top court rules for Amgen over employee lawsuit,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday handed a victory to Amgen Inc by throwing out a ruling in favor of current and former employees who say they lost money by investing in the pharmaceutical company’s own stock-ownership plan.

446,AMGN,Amgen fourth quarter profit tops street; raises 2016 forecast,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc’s (AMGN.O) fourth-quarter earnings soundly beat estimates on higher sales of its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel and lower costs, and the world’s largest biotechnology company raised its 2016 profit forecast. Amgen said on Thursday it now expects 2016 adjusted earnings of $10.60 to $11.00 per share, up from its prior view of $10.35 to $10.7. The change reflects U.S. congressional approval of the research and development tax credit and delays in competition from biosimilar versions of some of its products. Analysts on average were estimating 2016 earnings of $10.67 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding one-time items, Amgen had adjusted earnings of $2.61 a share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 32 cents. “The financial performance was great, and it’s nice to see the guidance go up so early in 2016,” said Cowen & Co analyst Eric Schmidt. Amgen now sees 2016 revenue of $22 billion to $22.5 billion versus its earlier view of $21.7 billion to $22.3 billion. Amgen this year will release data eagerly awaited by investors, including pivotal Phase III results on romosozumab, a monthly injection to build bone density in osteoporosis patients; and a first look at whether its new cholesterol fighter, Repatha, cuts the risk of heart attacks, strokes and death. Sales and insurer reimbursements are expected to be muted until those so-called outcomes results are unveiled. Once the heart benefits are known and added to the Repatha’s  label, “we should see some dramatic uptake,” said Tony Hooper, Amgen’s head of commercial operations. Revenue for the quarter rose 4 percent to $5.53 billion, matching Wall Street estimates. Amgen’s ongoing cost cuts helped drive the earnings beat as R&D; expenses fell 10 percent in the quarter and costs of sales decreased 7 percent. Sales of Enbrel rose 8 percent to $1.44 billion, primarily driven by price increases. That topped Wall Street estimates for about $1.32 billion. The osteoporosis drug Prolia also topped estimates as sales jumped 21 percent to $380 million, compared with analysts’ expectations of about $352 million. Sales of its older white blood cell booster Neupogen fell 4 percent due to competition, including from Novartis’ NOVN.VX Zarxio, the first approved biosimilar in the United States. Amgen said net profit rose to $1.8 billion, or $2.37 per share, from $1.29 billion, or $1.68 a share, a year ago. Amgen shares rose 20 cents in extended trading to $148.55, giving back some earlier gains.

450,AMGN,Amgen blood cell disorder drug meets primary goal in phase 3 trial,"Feb 15 (Reuters) - Biopharmaceutical company Amgen Inc  said on Monday its Aranesp drug met its primary goal of reducing the incidence of red blood cell transfusions in anemic patients suffering from Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) in a phase 3 trial. MDS, which is among the most common type of bone marrow failure syndromes in adults, occurs when blood cells do not mature in the bone marrow, putting patients at risk of infection, anemia or bleeding. The company said Aranesp also significantly improved erythroid response, a key measure of the formation of new red blood cells. Amgen said data from the trial was consistent with the known safety profile of Aranesp and the adverse effects were generally balanced between those given the drug in the trial and those given a placebo. However, adverse effects such as fatigue, pyrexia, headache and myalgia were at least five percent more frequent than the placebo group. Amgen last year reached a $71 million settlement with 48 U.S. states and the District of Columbia to resolve claims that it promoted Enbrel and Aranesp drugs for uses not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The company was accused by authorities of marketing Aranesp for off-label uses, such as to treat anemia caused by cancer. Aranesp sales totaled $1.93 billion in 2014.

453,AMGN,Fitch Rates Amgen Inc. Swiss Franc Notes 'BBB'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 23 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned Amgen Inc.'s (Amgen)  Swiss franc-denominated notes offering a 'BBB' rating.  The company intends to use the net proceeds from this issue to repay outstanding  indebtedness, including borrowings under a term loan credit agreement, to  repurchase shares of common stock and for general corporate purposes.  The notes are rated at the same level as Amgen's Long-term Issuer Default  Rating, as they represent senior unsecured obligations of the company The company had USD31.6bn of debt outstanding at end-2015, which are also rated  at 'BBB'.  A full list of Amgen's ratings is available at the end of this commentary. Amgen's profitability improved during 2015. This is largely the result of a  change in the Enbrel co-promotion agreement with Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) resulting  in declining royalty payments to Pfizer through 2016. Fitch expects further  margin expansion in 2016, driven by increasing sales, improving mix, lower  royalty payments to Pfizer, additional cost savings. Growth of a number of established products, progress with ramping up newer  medicines and advancing pipeline projects should help to offset some of the risk  of anticipated branded and biosimilar competition to Neulasta, Neupogen and  Epogen.  Amgen has made significant progress with its drug development pipeline during  the past two years with a number of key approvals and positive clinical data for  other projects in late-stage development. Fitch expects Amgen to continue generating solid free cash flow (FCF: cash from  operations less capital expenditure and dividends) of at least USD6bn annually,  representing about a 30% FCF margin, supported by improving sales and margins,  modestly offset by an increasing dividend. At 3.0x Amgen's gross debt-to-EBITDA is at the high end of the range for its  'BBB' rating. In 2015, the company issued USD3.5bn of debt to fund share  repurchases, which offset the deleveraging from EBITDA growth driven by recently  strong operational performance.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Continued Margin Improvement Expected  Fitch expects Amgen's margins will continue to improve during the intermediate  term. EBITDA margin will benefit from an improving sales mix, and a reduction in  selling, general and administration expense. The declining royalty payments by  Amgen to Pfizer associated with the start of a three-year phase out period for  the co-promotion agreement of Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada will also support  margin improvement in 2016. In addition, prioritisation of product pipeline  projects has reduced research and development spending as a percentage of sales.  Younger Portfolio Products Growing Newer therapies such as XGEVA (bone metastases), Prolia (osteoporosis), Nplate  (thrombocytopenia), Vectibix (metastatic colorectal cancer) and Kyprolis  (relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma) are posting strong double-digit  growth, as good clinical experience drives increased acceptance in the medical  community. These four products accounted for only 18% of sales during 2015  compared with 16% in 2014. Aggregrate growth for these five products was 23%  during 2015, while total sales grew 8% during the same period.  In addition,  2016 sales will benefit from recent market introductions of Repatha and Imlygic.  Significant Pipeline Progress Amgen has also experienced a number of successes in advancing products through  its pipeline. The company received FDA approval for Blincyto (acute  lymphoblastic leukemia) in December 2014, Corlanor (heart failure) in April  2015, Repatha (hyperlipidemia) in August 2015 and Imlygic (cancer) in October  2015. Brodalumumab (rheumatoid arthritis) and romosozumab (osteoporosis) have  generated positive clinical trial data. These drugs all have the potential to  improve outcomes in a number of patients that currently face sub-optimal  treatment options. Intellectual Property Challenges The base patent for Neulasta in the U.S. expired in October 2015, and in Europe  it expired in February 2015. International patents for Sensipar lapsed in  October 2015. In addition, the European patent for the second-generation  erythropoietin medicine, Aranesp, expired in August 2014. Collectively, these  maturing pharmaceuticals represent roughly 30% of total revenues that are at  risk to branded or biosimilar competition. Amgen has already lost patent protection in the U.S. for Epogen and Neupogen.  Teva's branded medication and Sandoz's recently-approved biosimilar therapy will  take share directly from Neupogen and, to a lesser extent, Neulasta, Amgen's  long-acting filagrastim treatment. However, the competing products will not  benefit from interchangeability with the originator biologics, requiring   competitors to spend on marketing and selling. This means that stiff price  competition will be less likely for Amgen's products. In addition, Amgen's  On-Body injector for Neulasta could help mitigate biosimilar competition. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for 2016 within the rating case for Amgen include: --Low to mid-single digit organic top-line growth driven by the uptake of new  product commercialisation offset by increased competitive pressure for some  established products .  --FCF of about USD6bn with   a roughly 50 bps improvement in the operating  EBITDA margin. --Cash deployment prioritised for dividends, share repurchases and targeted  acquisitions. --Gross leverage is maintained at or below 3.0x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments, individually or collectively, that may lead to  positive rating action include the following: --An upgrade of the ratings is not likely in the near-term given currently high  leverage; --An upgrade could occur if the company maintains leverage in the 2.2x to 2.6x  range and operational performance remains strong.  Negative: Future developments, individually or collectively, that may lead to  negative rating action include the following: --Gross leverage sustained above 3.0x, which would likely result in a Negative  Outlook or a one-notch downgrade; --Stressed leverage driven by financial decisions that include debt-financed  share repurchases, dividends or acquisitions. In addition, operational stress  that decreases profitability, greater-than-expected biosimilar and brand name  drug competition and/or unsuccessful commercialisation of the late-stage  research pipeline can put ratings under pressure. ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY The biggest risk to Amgen's liquidity profile is the increasing amount of cash  balances held overseas. The company had cash and short-term investments of  USD30bn on 30 September, 2015, of which only USD1.1bn resides domestically.   Unless the company chooses to repatriate cash, Fitch believes that Amgen will  continue to issue debt to fund domestic capital deployment, including payments  to shareholders.   Fitch forecasts FCF  to remain above USD6bn annually, representing a FCF margin  of around 30% through 2018, included a growing dividend that is currently at  USD2.26bn for the latest 12 months (LTM) to September 2015. FCF was USD6.6bn for  the LTM to September 2015. Additional liquidity comes from full availability of a recently amended and  extended USD2.5bn credit facility that matures on 30 July2019. The facility  backstops an untapped USD2.5bn commercial paper programme providing additional  financial flexibility. Fitch expects Amgen will refinance the vast majority of  its debt maturities. The company has roughly USD2.3bn of debt maturing in 2016,  USD4.3bn in 2017, USD2bn in 2018 and USD3.4bn in 2019.

454,AMGN,Generic drug ETF ailing despite political focus on high drug prices,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Calls in the U.S. presidential campaign to cut pharmaceutical prices are not helping to revive a barely two-month-old exchange-traded fund that invests in shares of generic drugmakers. In fact, low prices that define generic drugs may be the ETF’s biggest stumbling block, analysts said this week. The Market Vectors Generic Drugs ETF, which fund manager Van Eck Associates Corp launched with $2.5 million in assets on Jan. 12, has fallen 5 percent through Wednesday and has failed to attract even $1 in new money, according to Lipper. The iShares Global Healthcare ETF, with three-quarters of its portfolio in pharmaceutical and biotech stocks, fell only 0.9 percent. The Market Vectors fund, which tracks the Indxx LLC-built generic index, is the only U.S. ETF built on shares of generic drugmakers, which have been languishing. Attacks on soaring drug prices by Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton and other politicians have failed to boost profits on cheaper alternatives to patented branded drugs. Distributors like Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc are squeezing prices of generics. “Generic drugs are essentially commodity products chosen on cost and as the purchasers consolidate and exert their leverage we would expect downward pressure,” said Michael Levesque, analyst for Moody’s Corp. “There is a lot of discussion around drug-pricing reform and different initiatives such as letting Medicare negotiate drug pricing, but none of those become a reality unless Congress implements them through the passage of a law, and that has not happened despite the statements in campaigns.” Mylan NV, the Market Vectors ETF’s fifth-largest holding, is off 16 percent this year after posting weak results and as investors panned the company’s deal to acquire Swedish rival Meda AB. Another top holding, Endo International PLC, is off 29 percent this year in part after February earnings were dented by pricing pressure on its generic drugs. Two of the Market Vectors fund’s top three holdings, Allergan Plc and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, have lost value this year, while the third, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, has risen 6 percent. Enthusiasm has faded for biosimilars, drugs designed to have properties similar to those licensed previously, during the long wait for U.S. regulatory approval. Only one biosimilar, by Novartis AG, has come on the U.S. market. The treatment for chemotherapy side effects, designed to rival Amgen Inc’s Neupogen, has been less successful than investors such as Andy Acker, manager of the Janus Global Life Sciences Fund, had expected. Amgen is Acker’s top holding. Celltrion Inc, a top-10 holding of the Market Vectors generic ETF, backs a biosimilar drug expected to win approval. The stock has rallied 30 percent this year, but that has not been enough to make up for losses in the ETF’s other stocks. Indxx LLC, whose index the Market Vectors generic ETF tracks, said 15 percent of the fund’s returns come from companies that stand to profit from biosimilars, and that just half of its return comes from U.S. companies. “You tend to see a lot of companies get caught up in” market selloffs, said James Duffy, ETF product manager for Van Eck. “This is an area that we feel may have the potential to drive a lot of growth in the near future.” ",3032016,http://www.reuters.com/article/etf-pharmaceuticals-genericdrugs/generic-drug-etf-ailing-despite-political-focus-on-high-drug-prices-idUSL2N161224
455,AMGN,"Amgen beats Sanofi, Regeneron at cholesterol drug trial","(Reuters) - A federal jury upheld the validity of two Amgen Inc patents related to the company’s newly-approved drug to reduce bad cholesterol, in a defeat for Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, which make a rival drug. In a joint statement on Wednesday, Sanofi and Regeneron said they strongly disagreed with the verdict by jurors in Wilmington, Delaware upholding the validity of Amgen’s patents, which followed a weeklong trial.  Damages have yet to be set. The defendants said they plan to appeal to the U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which reviews patent disputes. In its October 2014 lawsuit, Amgen sought to stop Paris-based Sanofi and Tarrytown, New York-based Regeneron from selling Praluent, a drug intended to lower bad LDL cholesterol by blocking a protein known as PCSK9. Amgen makes a rival drug called Repatha, and said Praluent infringed the Thousand Oaks, California-based company’s patents related to the protein. Last summer, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Praluent and Repatha to reduce bad cholesterol. U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson, who presided over the trial, is expected to consider whether to issue a permanent injunction against the sale of Praluent. Sanofi and Regeneron said the verdict will not keep them from selling Praluent for now. But they may owe royalties to Amgen if the litigation, following any appeals, ultimately concludes in Amgen’s favor. Amgen in a statement said it was “thankful” for the verdict. The drugs are costlier than other treatments targeting bad cholesterol, with a list price topping $14,000 annually. Sales have been slow because insurers have resisted the cost, while many doctors are awaiting the results of clinical trials about whether the treatments also reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes. “A permanent injunction is unlikely,” Deutsche Bank analyst Tim Race said in a research note. “However, the likelihood of settlement has now increased substantially with Sanofi and its partner Regeneron potentially forced to pay royalties.” In afternoon trading, Amgen shares were up 70 cents at $143.91; Regeneron shares were down $2.83 at $364.39; and Sanofi’s American depositary shares were down 32 cents at $40.83.

459,AMGN,Amgen profit sails past Street expectations; raises 2016 outlook,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc on Thursday reported much higher-than-expected first-quarter profit as sales of several key drugs beat Wall Street estimates, and the company significantly raised its full-year earnings forecast. The rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel, bone fracture preventers Prolia and Xgeva and infection fighter Neulasta all performed better than analysts had projected. Excluding one-time items, the world’s largest biotechnology company reported adjusted earnings of $2.90 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 30 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Amgen said it now expected 2016 adjusted earnings of $10.85 to $11.20 per share, up from its prior forecast of $10.60 to $11.00 per share, and well ahead of analysts’ average expectations of $10.82. Amgen slightly raised its full-year revenue forecast to $22.2 billion to $22.6 billion from $22 billion to $22.5 billion. Sales of Enbrel, which also treats psoriasis, jumped 24 percent to $1.39 billion, largely due to a price increase. Analysts had expected about $1.25 billion. Sales of Neulasta rose 4 percent to $1.18 billion, while Prolia sales jumped 29 percent to $352 million. “We expect continued growth from Prolia for years,”  commercial operations chief Tony Hooper told analysts on a conference call after the company released earnings.  Quarterly results were also helped by payments from a licensing deal and a recently adopted accounting standard on how taxes are calculated on compensation. The company for the first time reported sales of its potent new cholesterol fighter, Repatha, which totaled just $16 million for the quarter. Insurers have made it difficult for patients prescribed with Repatha and a rival drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  to qualify for reimbursement. The policies are not expected to change until large studies prove the expensive treatments prevent heart attacks and deaths in addition to dramatically lowering “bad” LDL cholesterol. “Ongoing results continue to be good as they manage the business while awaiting important clinical data to open up a multibillion-dollar product. That’s pretty exciting,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said. Amgen has said it was expecting the first of those results in the second half of this year. “We will continue to work with payers to improve access to Repatha,” Hooper said, adding that cardiologists trying to get  the treatment for appropriate patients are “extremely frustrated.” The company said net profit rose to $1.9 billion, or $2.50 per share, from $1.62 billion, or $2.11 per share, a year ago.    Revenue rose 10 percent to $5.53 billion, topping Wall Street estimates of $5.32 billion. Amgen shares rose to $161.75 in extended trading after closing at $160.56 on Nasdaq.

463,AMGN,"Sanofi, Amgen cholesterol drugs win UK backing after price cuts","LONDON (Reuters) - Two rival cholesterol-lowering injections from Sanofi and Amgen have been recommended by Britain’s healthcare cost watchdog after the manufacturers offered special discounts to the country’s state-run health service. Sanofi’s Praluent, which was developed with Regeneron, and Amgen’s Repatha are both so-called PCSK9 medicines that work in a different way to existing cholesterol fighters such as statins. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said in draft guidance on Friday that both drugs could be considered for use by people whose cholesterol is still not under control despite trying other treatments. It stressed that the medicines would only be cost-effective with the promised discounts.   Both drugs cost more than 4,000 pounds ($5,780) per patient a year in Britain. That is already a lot less than their U.S. list price of around $14,000, but Sanofi and Amgen have committed to discount the British price by a further undisclosed amount for the UK National Health Service. While Praluent and Repatha are both viewed by analysts as eventual multi-billion-dollar-a-year sellers, demand for the medicines in markets worldwide so far has proved disappointing.

465,AMGN,Regeneron CEO says drug price critique by independent group unscientific,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer on Thursday took aim at an influential drug pricing watchdog, saying a critique of the company’s new cholesterol lowering therapy was non-scientific. The Boston-based Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) last fall reviewed two new potent cholesterol drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors. It concluded that the treatments should cost about 67 percent less than the list prices set by Regeneron with partner Sanofi, and by Amgen Inc. Health insurers have refused to cover the cost of the treatments in most cases, intensifying a high-profile fight over rising drug prices. ICER began doing value-based analyses last year with a review of new hepatitis C drugs, and has become a prominent voice casting doubt on the price and value of medications. Schleifer emphasized the importance of value-based drug pricing. On Wednesday, health insurer Cigna Corp said it had reached new reimbursement contracts for the cholesterol medicines based on how well they perform for patients. Speaking at the Financial Times U.S. Healthcare & Life Sciences Summit, Schleifer said ICER’s method, which reduced the value of the treatments based on its assumption of what the United States could afford, lacked scientific basis. “They did all the calculations and they said it’s X, which is ok. I could have lived with that. But ... they said society can’t afford X, so we are going to say it’s one-third X,” Schleifer said during a panel discussion.  “They had value-based pricing, but they just decided that well we can’t afford it. That wasn’t scientific. There was no intellectual honesty there.” ICER Chief Operating Officer Sarah Emond, on a panel with Schleifer, countered that budget impact is part of the equation.  “You’re attacking the science of an independent non-profit whose entire mission is tied to opening the black box of pricing,” she said. Insurers and the government say value-based pricing can help keep drug prices from climbing too fast. Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky said at the conference that it is “incumbent upon our industry to make sure we are moving towards more outcomes based models.” The new cholesterol fighters were approved for patients with a hereditary form of extreme high cholesterol and those with heart disease. Clinical data designed to show whether they can reduce the risk of heart attack and death in addition to lowering cholesterol are expected late this year and could help  expand their reach to more patients.

466,AMGN,Fitch Rates Amgen Inc. Notes Offering 'BBB'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to Amgen  Inc.'s (Amgen) notes offering. The company intends to use the net proceeds from  this offering to repay select outstanding notes. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  The ratings apply to $34.5 billion of debt outstanding at Mar. 31, 2016. A full  list of Amgen's ratings can be found at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --At 3.1x gross debt-to-EBITDA, Amgen's gross debt leverage is at the high end  of the range for its 'BBB' rating. In 2015, the company issued $3.5 billion of  debt to fund share repurchases which offset the deleveraging from EBITDA growth  driven by its recently strong operational performance.  --Amgen's profitability improved during 2015. This was largely the result of a  change in the Enbrel co-promotion agreement with Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) which led  to declining royalty payments to Pfizer through 2016. Fitch expects further  margin expansion in 2016 driven by increasing sales, improving sales mix, lower  royalty payments to Pfizer, and additional cost savings. --Growth of a number of established products, progress in ramping up newer  medicines and advancing pipeline projects should help to offset some of the risk  of anticipated branded and biosimilar competition with Neulasta, Neupogen and  Epogen.  --Amgen has made significant progress in its drug development pipeline during  the past two years with a number of key approvals and positive clinical data for  other projects in late-stage development. --Fitch expects Amgen to continue generating solid free cash flow (FCF; CFFO  less capital expenditure and dividends) of at least $6 billion annually,  representing about a 30% FCF margin, supported by improving sales and margins,  modestly offset by an increasing dividend. --Fitch expects Amgen's margins will continue to improve during the intermediate  term. EBITDA margin will benefit from an improving sales mix, and a reduction in  selling, general and administration expense. The declining royalty payments by  Amgen to Pfizer associated with the start of a three-year phase-out period for  the co-promotion agreement of Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada will also support  margin improvement in 2016. In addition, prioritization of product pipeline  projects has reduced research and development spending as a percentage of sales.  --Newer therapies such as XGEVA (bone metastases), Prolia (osteoporosis), Nplate  (thrombocytopenia), Vectibix (metastatic colorectal cancer) and Kyprolis  (relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma) are posting strong double-digit  growth, as good clinical experience drives increased acceptance in the medical  community. These five products accounted for only 18% of sales during 2015  compared to 16% in 2014. Aggregrate growth for these five products was 23%  during 2015, while total firm sales grew 8% during the same period. In addition,  we believe 2016 sales will benefit from recent market introductions of Repatha  and Imlygic.  --Amgen has also experienced a number of successes in advancing products through  its pipeline. The company received FDA approval for Blincyto (acute  lymphoblastic leukemia) in December 2014, Corlanor (heart failure) in April  2015, Repatha (hyperlipidemia) in August 2015 and Imlygic (cancer) in October  2015. Brodalumumab (rheumatoid arthritis) and romosozumab (osteoporosis) have  generated positive clinical trial data. These drugs all have the potential to  improve outcomes in a number of patients that currently face suboptimal  treatment options. --Amgen has already lost patent protection in the U.S. for Epogen and Neupogen.  Teva's branded medication and Sandoz's recently approved biosimilar therapy will  take share directly from Neupogen and to a lesser extent Neulasta, Amgen's  long-acting filagrastim treatment. However, the competing products will not  benefit from interchangeability with the originator biologics, requiring  competitors to spend on marketing and selling. This means that stiff price  competition will be less likely for Amgen's products. In addition, Amgen's  On-Body injector for Neulasta could help mitigate biosimilar competition. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for 2016 within the rating case for Amgen include: --Low- to mid-single-digit organic topline growth driven by the uptake of new  product commercialization offset by increased competitive pressure for some  established products.  --FCF of about $6 billion with a roughly 50bp improvement in the operating  EBITDA margin. --Cash deployment prioritized for dividends, share repurchases and targeted  acquisitions. --Total leverage maintained at or below 3x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments, individually or collectively, that may lead to  positive rating action include the following: --An upgrade of the ratings is not likely in the near term given currently high  leverage; --An upgrade could occur if the company maintained leverage in the 2.2x to 2.6x  range and operational performance remained strong.  Negative: Future developments, individually or collectively, that may lead to  negative rating action include the following: --An expectation for gross debt leverage maintained durably above 3x would  likely result in a Negative Outlook or a one-notch downgrade; --Stressed leverage could be driven by financial decisions that include  debt-financed share repurchases, dividends or acquisitions. In addition,  operational stress that decreases profitability, greater-than-expected  biosimilar and brand name drug competition and/or unsuccessful commercialization  of the late-stage research pipeline have the potential to stress its current  rating. LIQUIDITY The biggest concern in Amgen's liquidity profile is the growing amount of cash  balances held overseas. The company had cash and short-term investments of $34.7  billion on Mar. 31, 2016, of which only $6.8 billion resides domestically.  Unless the company chooses to repatriate cash, Fitch believes that Amgen will  continue to issue debt to fund domestic capital deployment, including payments  to shareholders. Fitch projects FCF (CFFO less capital expenditures and  dividends) to remain above $6 billion annually, representing FCF margins of  around 30% through 2018, included a growing dividend that is currently at $2.55  billion for the latest 12 months (LTM) as of Mar. 31, 2016. FCF was $6.5 billion  for the LTM as of Mar. 31, 2016. Additional liquidity comes from full availability of a recently amended and  extended $2.5 billion credit facility that matures on July 30, 2019. The  facility backstops an untapped $2.5 billion commercial paper program providing  additional financial flexibility. Fitch expects Amgen will refinance the vast  majority of its debt maturities. The company has roughly $2.1 billion of debt  maturing in 2016, $4.3 billion in 2017, $2.1 billion in 2018 and $3.4 billion in  2019. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch rates Amgen as follows: --Long-Term IDR 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured debt 'BBB'; --Bank loan 'BBB'; --Short-Term IDR 'F2';  --Commercial paper 'F2'.

467,AMGN,Sanofi presses on with threat to oust Medivation's board,"(Reuters) - France’s Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) was moving ahead on Friday with preparations to replace Medivation Inc’s MDVN.O board of directors after the U.S. cancer drug maker refused to engage with it in sale talks based on a $9.3 billion acquisition offer. Sanofi could unveil a slate of nominees to replace Medivation’s board as early as this month, people familiar with the matter said, in line with a threat it made in a May 4 letter to the company that reiterated its acquisition proposal.  Medivation has signed non-disclosure agreements to share confidential information with other pharmaceutical companies interested in an acquisition, including Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), sources told Reuters on Monday. However, Medivation will not engage in sale talks with Sanofi unless the latter raises its $52.50 per share cash offer, the people said. Sanofi has said it is willing to raise its offer only after Medivation engages in talks. Medivation shares were trading at $61.43 in New York on Friday. Sanofi this week added Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) as a financial advisor, while continuing to receive advice from Morgan Stanley (MS.N), the people said. Goldman also has a close relationship with Pfizer, having advised it on many deals, including its abandoned $160 billion acquisition of Allergan Plc (AGN.N). Pfizer on Friday continued to work with advice from investment banks on a possible bid for Medivation, though there is no certainty such an offer would be submitted, some of the sources said. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Sanofi, Medivation, Goldman Sachs and Pfizer declined to comment. Sanofi is vying for Medivation in an attempt to expand in the lucrative oncology sector, as it struggles to compensate for declining revenues from a key diabetes drug that recently lost patent protection. Should Medivation agree to a sale, it would mark a bittersweet moment for Chief Executive David Hung, who founded the company in 2003. In 13 years, he built Medivation from a penny stock peddling a 20-year-old Russian treatment for hay fever into a $10 billion market capitalization oncology company. In the process, he overcame numerous obstacles, including the failure of Alzheimer’s treatment Dimebon, which used to be sold as an antihistamine in Russia. In 2009, Hung took a bet on a chemical compound called MDV3100, which was developed at the University of California, Los Angeles.  In partnership with Japan’s Astellas Pharma Inc (4503.T), Medivation turned MDV3100 into a nearly $2 billion prostate cancer drug called Xtandi.

In partnership with Japan’s Astellas Pharma Inc (4503.T), Medivation turned MDV3100 into a nearly $2 billion prostate cancer drug called Xtandi.

470,AMGN,Exclusive: Sanofi to unveil challenge to Medivation's board - sources,"(Reuters) - France’s Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) is preparing to name candidates it will put forward to replace the entire board of U.S. cancer drug company Medivation Inc MDVN.O as early as Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter. Sanofi has threatened to oust the board after Medivation rejected its unsolicited $9.3 billion acquisition offer late last month, taking advantage of a so-called ‘written consent’ rule that gives Medivation shareholders the ability to act at any time to replace directors. Medivation has declined to engage in sale talks with Sanofi unless the latter raises its $52.50 per share cash offer first, sources have said. The French drugmaker has said it is willing to raise its bid only after Medivation engages with it in negotiations. Medivation shares ended trading on Tuesday in New York at $61.91.  Among Sanofi’s eight nominees are Michael Campbell, the former chief executive of Arch Chemicals Inc, Ronald Rolfe, a retired partner at law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, and Barbara Deptula, a former executive vice president and chief corporate development officer of biopharmaceutical company Shire Plc (SHP.L), one of the people said. The sources asked not to be identified because the names of the nominees have not been disclosed. Medivation and Sanofi representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Medivation has signed non-disclosure agreements to share confidential information with other pharmaceutical companies interested in an acquisition, including Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), sources told Reuters earlier this month. However, no other company is close to tabling an offer for Medivation, according to the sources. Sanofi is vying for Medivation in an attempt to expand in the lucrative oncology sector, as it struggles to compensate for declining revenues from a key diabetes drug that recently lost patent protection. Medivation has argued that Sanofi’s offer fails to value fairly the prospects of its recently developed prostate cancer drug XTANDI, as well as two other products currently in clinical trials; Talazoparib, for the treatment of breast cancer, and Pidilizumab, for the treatment of blood cancers. Campbell served as chairman, president and chief executive officer of Arch Chemicals, a maker of products that kill bacteria and fungi, between 1999 and 2011. Switzerland’s Lonza AG (LONN.S) agreed in 2011 to buy the company for $1.2 billion. Rolfe retired from Cravath’s litigation department in 2010, having worked on major antitrust and securities cases, as well as U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and grand jury investigations. His clients included IBM Corp (IBM.N), PepsiCo Inc PEP.N and Sprint Corp (S.N). Deptula worked at Shire between 2004 and 2012, where she led efforts to expand its product portfolio. She has been a director on the board of AMAG Pharmaceuticals Inc (AMAG.O), a specialty pharmaceutical company focusing on maternal health, anemia and cancer supportive care, since 2013.

471,AMGN,Sanofi moves to oust Medivation board in $9.3 billion takeover fight,"(Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi (SASY.PA) named eight candidates to replace the entire board of Medivation Inc MDVN.O on Wednesday, stepping up pressure on the U.S. cancer drug company which has rejected its $9.3 billion takeover approach. Reuters reported earlier that Sanofi was about to propose a new board line-up, taking advantage of a so-called written consent rule that gives Medivation shareholders the ability to act at any time to replace directors. Sanofi filed documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking the approval of Medivation shareholders for the board’s overthrow.  “Despite multiple attempts, both prior to and following the public disclosure of Sanofi’s proposal, Medivation has thus far refused to engage with us regarding the merits of a value creating transaction,” said Sanofi CEO Olivier Brandicourt. “Unfortunately, this has left us with no choice but to commence a process to elect directors who are more open to supporting the best interests of Medivation shareholders regarding a potential transaction.” Medivation urged its stockholders to reject Sanofi’s election attempt and said it would promptly file materials with the SEC to try and block it. Efforts to remove a board usually occur through dissident shareholders at a company’s annual meeting.  But some companies also grant shareholders the right to act by written consent in lieu of an annual meeting, where the results of such a vote are either binding or non-binding, depending on what bylaws permit.  Medivation’s bylaws allow written consent votes to be immediately binding, as long as at least a majority, or 50.1 percent, of shareholders vote in favor of the proposal, according to people familiar with the matter.  Written consents are rare and usually employed by activist investors for various reasons, which include pressing a campaign after a director nomination deadline has passed. Carl Icahn threatened consent last year at AIG (AIG.N) to get a director on the insurer’s board.  Since the start of 2010, there have been only 37 activism campaigns that pursued written consent, according to FactSet. “HAND-PICKED NOMINEES”  Sanofi’s nominees for Medivation’s board are Michael Campbell, Barbara Deptula, Wendy Lane, Ronald Rolfe, Steven Shulman, Charles Slacik, James Tyree and David Wilson — a roster of independent candidates with experience in the drug industry, finance and the law. Campbell led Arch Chemicals, before it was sold to Lonza (LONN.S) in 2011 for $1.2 billion, while Deptula headed corporate development at Shire (SHP.L). Lane chairs investment firm Lane Holdings and Rolfe retired from Cravath’s litigation department in 2010. Medivation, which rejected Sanofi’s approach last month, said again that its $52.50 per share cash offer was “substantially inadequate”. “Its proposal to replace our existing directors with its own hand-picked nominees is simply a tactical maneuver to facilitate a transaction that will transfer value that rightly belongs to Medivation stockholders to Sanofi,” said CEO David Hung. In a new letter to Medivation’s board, Brandicourt reiterated that Sanofi could raise its offer if the U.S. firm engaged in talks. Medivation shares were down 0.7 percent at $61.46 in New York on Wednesday. The U.S. company has signed non-disclosure agreements to share confidential information with other potential acquirers, including Pfizer (PFE.N) and Amgen (AMGN.O), sources told Reuters earlier this month. Brandicourt expressed frustration at this. “There have been published reports that you have signed confidentiality agreements with other parties. If that is accurate, we cannot see how you have not done so with us,” he wrote. Sanofi wants Medivation - which sells a successful prostate cancer drug called Xtandi and has others in development - to expand in the lucrative oncology sector, as it seeks new businesses to compensate for flagging diabetes revenues. Brandicourt said Sanofi was in a position to provide more value than any other party, given the strategic importance of the transaction to the Paris-based company.

473,AMGN,Amgen says migraine prevention drug meets main goal of study,"(Reuters) - An experimental drug for prevention of chronic migraine headaches from Amgen Inc met the main goal of a midstage study by reducing the number of monthly attacks compared with a placebo, the company said on Wednesday. The biotech drug, erenumab, which is being co-developed with Swiss drugmaker Novartis, was tested at two doses in a 12-week, 667-patient Phase II study of subjects who were experiencing about 18 migraine days a month. Patients who received either the 70 milligram or 140 mg doses injected once monthly experienced a 6.6-day reduction in monthly migraine days, according to initial results. That compared with a 4.2-day reduction for those who received a placebo, a difference deemed to be statistically significant. Amgen expects to release more detailed data, including secondary goals such as reduction of at least 50 percent in monthly migraine days and change in cumulative monthly headache hours, at a later date. The company is also expecting data later this year from a late stage study of the medicine for patients who suffer from episodic migraines. Chronic was defined as having at least 15 headache days per month over 3 months, while 4 to 14 headache days per month was considered episodic. Between three and seven million Americans suffer from chronic migraines, which often involve nausea, vomiting and intense sensitivity to light and sound, in addition to incapacitating head pain. “Migraine is the sixth leading cause of disability worldwide,” Sean Harper, Amgen’s research chief, said in a statement. The safety of erenumab was similar to placebo, the company said. The most common side effects involved injection site pain and upper respiratory tract infections. Under the collaboration agreement with Novartis, Amgen holds the sales rights for the United States, Canada and Japan, while Novartis would sell the drug in Europe and the rest of the world if it wins regulatory approval.

477,AMGN,"UPDATE 2-U.S. doctors, hospitals paid billions by drug, device makers - gov't","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Doctors and hospitals in the United States received $7.52 billion in payments and ownership and investment interests from the makers of drugs and medical devices in 2015, according to data released by a government health agency. The data includes payments for items and services such as food and beverage, travel, education, honoraria as well as research, and is based on information related to 618,000 doctors, more than 1,110 teaching hospitals and 1,456 companies. The Open Payments program, which was created under the Affordable Care Act healthcare reform with the aim of improving transparency, requires drug and device manufacturers to report payments to healthcare providers for items like speaking engagements about their products and research grants. The report allows individuals to track payments to their physicians by drug companies. The need for greater transparency was spawned by concerns that physician prescribing habits and choices could be driven by payments from pharmaceutical and medical device companies. The program reported $2.6 billion in general payments, $3.89 billion in research payments and $1.02 billion of ownership or investment interests. This is the third annual report in the program, which has a searchable website. In 2014, payments totaled $7.49 billion. The agency said it had determined that 2.26 percent of all financial transactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians were related to opioid medications. Among companies with the highest payments is the largest U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc, which made $44.7 million in total general payments and $391.7 million in research payments.  Merck & Co made $34.4 million in general payments and $128 million in research payments, according to the searchable database. Amgen Inc, another big drugmaker, made $31.4 million in general payments and $222.2 million in total research payments. Allergan Inc made $35.6 million in general payments and $27.5 million in research payments and Actavis Inc - which now goes by the name Allergan after a merger - made $13.4 million in general payments and $36.6 million in research payments, according to the database. Amgen said it supports initiatives that bring greater transparency to interactions between industry and healthcare providers. Such collaboration “contributes to bringing innovative medicines and therapies to patients,” the company said in an emailed statement.  Merck declined to comment, while representatives for the other companies were not immediately available for comment.

478,AMGN,Amgen drug appears 'highly similar' to Humira: FDA staff,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc’s version of AbbVie Inc’s Humira arthritis drug, the world’s top-selling medicine, appears similar in potency and safety to the original product, U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff members said on Friday.  The assessment precedes an all-day meeting on Tuesday of an independent panel of medical advisers who will decide whether to recommend approval of ABP 501, Amgen’s cheaper version of Humira. In two large Amgen studies, the Thousand Oaks, California-based company said it showed similar effectiveness to Humira. In documents posted on the FDA’s website, staff scientists said those trials suggested ABP 501 and Humira are “highly similar” in their safety, purity and potency in treating rheumatoid arthritis and plaque psoriasis. The staff’s briefing report said Amgen’s data also supported use of ABP 501 against other diseases Humira treats. Amgen stock rose 1.9 percent, while shares of suburban Chicago-based AbbVie advanced 1 percent, amid broad gains for the stock market. Injectable biotech drugs like Humira are made in living cells and cannot be identical, so copies of them are called biosimilars.  Humira, with annual sales of $14 billion, delivers 60 percent of AbbVie’s revenue. Like Amgen’s Enbrel and Johnson & Johnson’s Remicade, it blocks a protein called tumor necrosis factor. Investors are nervous because Humira’s main patent lapses in December, opening the drug up to potential competition from cheaper biosimilars being developed by companies that also include Coherus Biosciences Inc and Germany’s Boehringer Ingelheim. Amgen, as the first to seek U.S. approval, could have the inside track to become the first to market. AbbVie says numerous other patents will stave off the introduction of biosimilar forms of Humira until at least 2022, ensuring continued strong U.S. sales. Any company introducing a biosimilar before resolving patent disputes with the maker of the original product risks facing triple damages from an unfavorable court ruling. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover, however, said the first biosimilar of Humira would win U.S. approval and be available well before 2022, causing sales of the branded drug to fall about 5 percent in 2018 and 18 percent in 2019. “There will be litigation back and forth, but we think these biosimilars will be launched and probably do more damage to Humira than (Wall Street) is expecting,” Conover said.  Although Amgen has suggested it will introduce ABP 501 by 2018, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said he expected no Humira biosimilars in the United States until 2021 because of AbbVie’s “broad patent estate.” Even as Amgen pushes its copy of Humira to market, it is fighting to fend off biosimilar competition for Enbrel. The same FDA advisory panel will decide on Wednesday whether to recommend Novartis AG’s cheaper version of the drug, which brings Amgen annual U.S. sales of more than $5 billion. The FDA in the past year has approved the first two U.S. biosimilars, including Novartis’s version of Neupogen, an Amgen drug used to boost white blood cells.

The review, posted on the FDA’s website on Monday, comes two days ahead of a meeting of outside advisers who will discuss the drug and recommend whether it should be approved.  The FDA is not obliged to follow the recommendations of its advisory panels but typically does so. Enbrel is an injected biologic drug made from living cells. Biologics are more complex than traditional pills and cannot be copied with precision. Copies are therefore called biosimilars, not generics. Enbrel was approved in 1998 and generated more than $5 billion in U.S. sales last year. It works by blocking a protein known as tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, and is approved for a number of conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Novartis, through its generic drug division Sandoz, is seeking U.S. approval for the same indications. The FDA review found there were no clinically meaningful differences between the two drugs in the studied condition of psoriasis.     The review found that the company had also provided an extensive data package to address scientific considerations to support biosimilarity to other conditions for which Enbrel is approved. Dr. Joan Von Feldt, president of the American College of Rheumatology, cautioned in a statement against approving biosimilars for conditions for which they have not been studied and urged the FDA to provide clinical data from biosimilars on the drug’s label.

The FDA review found there were no clinically meaningful differences between the two drugs in the studied condition of psoriasis. The review found that the company had also provided an extensive data package to address scientific considerations to support biosimilarity to other conditions for which Enbrel is approved. Even if the FDA approves the drug, it could be some time before it reaches the market. Amgen has filed suit against Sandoz, claiming the company is “piggybacking on the fruits” of their research efforts. Ironically, the same panel on Tuesday will discuss whether the FDA should approve Amgen’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s  TNF-inhibitor Humira, which generated U.S. sales last year of more than $8 billion. In FDA documents posted on Friday, staff reviewers found Amgen’s version to be highly similar to Humira in treating rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis and other indications. In this instance, Amgen is in a legal battle with Abbvie, which claims its patents protect Humira against U.S. competition until at least 2022. Novartis is the first to seek U.S. approval for a biosimilar to Enbrel. In January, Biogen Inc and Samsung Bioepis received European approval for their Enbrel biosimilar. Sandoz has already received FDA approval for Zarxio, a biosimilar version of Amgen’s white blood cell-boosting drug Neupogen.

484,AMGN,FDA panel backs Amgen copy of AbbVie arthritis drug Humira,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc’s cheaper version of AbbVie’s top-selling arthritis drug Humira is highly similar to the original and should be approved, an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded on Tuesday. The panel voted 26-0 that the drug, ABP 501, which was studied in rheumatoid arthritis and plaque psoriasis, was similar in safety and effectiveness to the original. AbbVie is trying to block Amgen’s drug from reaching the market. It claims it has patents in place to protect Humira, the world’s biggest-selling drug, in the United States until at least 2022. The panel concluded that the study results could be extrapolated to other conditions for which Humira is approved, including adult Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis and should be approved for those conditions as well. The FDA is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisory committee but typically does so. The panel’s conclusions were consistent with those of FDA scientists, who published their preliminary review of the drug on Friday. Panelists had some reservations about approving the drug for indications for which it had not been tested in clinical trials and urged the FDA to require companies to conduct post-market surveillance studies to make sure the product works as expected in those conditions. “I voted yes despite reservations about extrapolating from the data we have, which was good, to the data we don’t have and will never have,” said Nancy Geller, a biostatistician at the National Institutes of Health. Panelists also urged greater education of the public about biosimilars, copies of biologic drugs made from living cells. Biosimilars are more complex than traditional pills and cannot be copied with precision. Biosimilars are not interchangeable with the original product. Amgen could introduce its drug before the patent dispute with AbbVie is resolved, but risks facing triple damages from an unfavorable court ruling. Some analysts expect the drug to be available well before 2022 and expect sales of Humira to fall as much as 18 percent in 2019. Humira last year generated U.S. sales of more than $8 billion. On Wednesday the panel will vote on whether the FDA should approve Novartis AG’s cheaper version of Amgen’s arthritis drug Enbrel. Enbrel and Humira both belong to a class of drugs that block a protein involved in inflammation known as tumor necrosis factor, or TNF.

490,AMGN,UPDATE 2-Valeant psoriasis drug's suicide risk hard to assess -FDA Staff,"(Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc’s experimental drug to treat the skin disorder psoriasis carries a potential risk of suicide that is challenging to assess due to limited data, according to a preliminary review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration published on Friday. The review comes two days ahead of a meeting of outside experts who will advise the FDA on whether the drug should be approved. The agency is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so. In clinical trials of the drug, brodalumab, there were six suicides across all programs: four in psoriasis studies, one in a rheumatoid arthritis study and one in a psoriatic arthritis study. “We have uncertainty about whether the signal for completed suicide is a risk related to brodalumab treatment,” FDA reviewers said. “From the available data, we cannot conclude whether or not suicide is a drug-related risk.” If approved, brodalumab has the potential to be used in a large number of patients in the United States and likely prescribed by a doctor that may not be familiar with screening for and diagnosing suicidal thinking and behavior, the reviewers said. There are several risk management options that could provide some assurance that doctors and patients understand the safe use conditions of taking the drug. “However, no risk management strategy will completely eliminate the risk” they said. Brodalumab, was initially developed by AstraZeneca Plc and Amgen Inc. In May, 2015, Amgen withdrew from the partnership after trials revealed the potential suicide risk. AstraZeneca subsequently licensed global rights to the drug to Valeant, whose fortunes have plummeted over the past year amid criticism of its high drug prices and suspect relationship with a specialty pharmacy. AstraZeneca recently terminated Valeant’s license to market brodalumab in Europe and signed an exclusive license instead with Denmark’s LEO Pharma. Before the trial results, AstraZeneca said brodalumab could generate annual sales of up to $1.5 billion a year. David Maris, an analyst at Wells Fargo, recently projected it would, if approved, generate just $250 million by 2020. “Given the drug’s safety profile, we expect a challenging commercial launch,” he said in a research report. Brodalumab is known as an interleukin-17 inhibitor. Other drugs in the same class include Novartis AG’s Cosentyx and Eli Lilly & Co’s Taltz. The drug would also compete with Amgen’s Enbrel and AbbVie’s Humira.

Vasant Narasimhan, head of development at Novartis Pharmaceuticals, said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had issued a complete response letter for the product at the end of June, without giving further details. The FDA typically issues such letters when more information is needed to allow approval.

492,AMGN,UPDATE 2-U.S. FDA panel backs Valeant psoriasis drug with risk program,"(Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc’s experimental drug to treat the skin disorder psoriasis should be approved as long as certain measures are put in place to mitigate the risk of suicide, an advisory committee to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded on Tuesday. The FDA is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisory committees but typically does so. In clinical trials of the drug, brodalumab, there were six suicides across all programs: four in psoriasis studies, one in a rheumatoid arthritis study and one in a psoriatic arthritis study. Even so, the committee voted 18-0 that the drug should be approved, saying the benefit outweighed the potential risk. Of those, 14 voted that the drug should only be prescribed alongside a strong risk management program that goes beyond simply including the information in the label. Such programs can include medication guides and communications plans for healthcare providers. Panelists said there was a need for new drugs for psoriasis and they would like to have brodalumab available as an option. They offered various suggestions about how to mitigate the suicide risk, including a boxed warning and a patient registry to collect patient data and more clearly assess suicide risk. Some thought the registry should be mandatory and others thought it should be voluntary. Some thought any registry would create unnecessary barriers to accessing the drug and may not reflect a true estimate of the suicide risk. Valeant itself has a risk management proposal that includes participation in a registry and enhanced communication but no boxed warning. Brodalumab blocks a cell receptor known as interleukin-17 to tamp down inflammation. Several other IL-17 inhibitors are already on the market, including Cosentyx from Novartis AGand Taltz from Eli Lilly & Co. The drug would also compete with Amgen’s Enbrel, Johnson & Johnson’s Remicade and AbbVie’s Humira. About 7.5 million people in the United States suffer from psoriasis, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. The disorder, characterized by raised, scaly skin patches, can be associated with other conditions, including diabetes and heart disease.  Brodalumab was initially developed by AstraZeneca Plc and Amgen Inc. In May, 2015, Amgen withdrew from the partnership because of the suicides.   AstraZeneca subsequently licensed global rights to the drug to Valeant, whose fortunes have plummeted over the past year amid criticism of its high drug prices and cloudy relationship with a specialty pharmacy.

496,AMGN,Old pharma sees new profit cure in cancer drugs,"(Reuters) - Some of the world’s largest drug companies are taking out their checkbooks for acquisitions of smaller peers whose cancer drugs have the potential to cure not just patients, but corporate growth prospects as well. After decades in which progress meant extending life by weeks or months, new cancer treatments hold promise of adding years to patients’ lives and billions of dollars in revenue to the companies that own them. Some of the most promising, known as immunotherapy, harness the body’s own defense system to fight cancer. For many pharmaceutical companies, this wave of innovation couldn’t have come at a better time. A generation of mainstay drugs have gone off patent, raising the stakes for companies vying for a foothold in the burgeoning oncology market. In recent months, executives at many big pharmaceutical companies have expressed interest in building cancer treatment portfolios through acquisitions. They range from well-established incumbents, such as Roche Holding AG and Amgen Inc, to relative outsiders, including Sanofi and Gilead, according to public statements from the companies and several sources familiar with the companies plans and who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Amgen declined to comment. Roche, Sanofi and Gilead did not respond to requests to comment. Among the most logical acquisition targets are Incyte Corporation and Seattle Genetics, which have respective market capitalizations of about $16 billion and $6 billion, said Michael King, a biotechnology analyst at JMP Securities. Incyte’s blood cancer drug, Jakafi, produced more than $600 million in sales last year. Seattle Genetic’s lymphoma drug, ADCETRIS, earned revenues of nearly $450 million. Both companies declined to comment. The acquisition of promising cancer drugs is “going to be a major theme in the life sciences sector for the next several years,” said Kennen MacKay, a biotechnology analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG. Acquisitions of cancer drug companies accounted for about 20 percent of the $63 billion in pharmaceutical and biotech M&A; announced this year, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Cancer deals accounted for a smaller share - 16 percent - of a larger pharmaceutical M&A; pie during the first half of 2015. Deals involving cancer drugs are expected to rise in the second half of the year, as corporate boards of potential target companies begin to accept the lower valuations the sector has seen in recent months and become more open to deals. The Nasdaq Biotech Index, a common measure of life sciences companies’ performance, has plunged more than 30 percent from 2015 highs, as political criticism of drug prices fueled investor concerns. Global spending on cancer drugs is on the rise and may reach $178 billion by 2020, up from $107 billion in 2015, according to market research firm IMS Health. About half of that will occur in the United States. That makes oncology medication to be one of the single biggest anticipated drivers of prescription drug revenue growth over the next five years, according to data from consultancy Ernst and Young.  “I think an uptick in activity is very likely,” said Jeff Greene, global transactions leader for life sciences at EY. “We have seen some big deals already, and we are likely to see even more, large and small, in the second half of this year.”  Recent deals include AbbVie Inc’s $10 billion acquisition of lung cancer company Stemcentryx, Jazz Pharmaceuticals’ $1.5 billion takeover of leukemia drug maker Celator Pharmaceuticals Inc, and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s roughly $500 million acquisition of Cormorant Pharmaceuticals. More dealmaking is on the way. Earlier this month, Medivation Inc, a U.S. prostate cancer drug company with a market capitalization of $10 billion, said it would open its books to Sanofi SA as part of a sale process that sources said also has attracted Pfizer Inc and Celgene Corp. For some, laying claim to a piece of the oncology sector’s blockbuster growth could help offset the waning fortunes of mature drugs. For example, Sanofi’s blockbuster diabetes drug, Lantus, will face heightened generic drug competition in December. Gilead faces increased pressure on its liver disease franchise, which makes up two-thirds of its revenues. Abbvie, which purchased two oncology companies in the past year, Pharmacyclics and Stemcentryx, is facing potential competition for its biggest drug, Humira, for arthritis. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel recently recommended approval of an application by Amgen to sell a similar product. Best equipped to play a leading role are major pharmaceutical companies because bringing the new generation of cancer medicines under development to market requires scale and resources. “Oncology is a go-big-or-go-home category,” said Brian Corvino, a life sciences consultant at Decision Resources Group. “The amount of investment to develop and commercialize oncology drugs is massive and only becomes efficient at a certain scale.” The benefits of scale have only grown in recent years, as insurance companies increasingly have demanded drug makers justify prices in terms of the value they add to patient’s health. A large player in oncology is better equipped to partner with health care providers to collect data on a drug’s efficacy and argue the case to major insurers, Corvino said. From an acquirer’s perspective, the most attractive targets are companies with drugs that are already generating some revenue and are treating diseases where competition is scant. “For players that are looking to build an oncology presence, you need to buy a company that already has a blockbuster out there,” MacKay said. Companies whose drugs are still in development pose greater risk. Shares of Juno Therapeutics, for example, dropped about 30 percent earlier this month when the FDA placed a hold on a clinical trial for its main leukemia drug after two people died. The hold was later reversed and the stock partly recovered. ",7192016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oncology-m-a/old-pharma-sees-new-profit-cure-in-cancer-drugs-idUSKCN0ZZ0BG

The company is on track to meet or exceed its long-term objectives, Chief Executive Robert Bradway said in a statement. Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology company by market value, now expects 2016 adjusted earnings of $11.10 to $11.40 per share, up from its prior view of $10.85 to $11.20. Its midpoint is above of Wall Street estimates of $11.18 for the year. The company, which significantly increased its earnings forecast in April, also raised its full-year revenue outlook and now expects $22.5 billion to $22.8 billion, up from $22.2 billion to $22.6 billion. Excluding items, Amgen had adjusted earnings of $2.84 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 10 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “It’s consistent with the excellent performance they’ve been having,” Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt said in a telephone interview. “Amgen’s had a really strong five of six quarters now.” Revenue rose 6 percent to $5.7 billion, exceeding Wall Street estimates of about $5.6 billion, led by Enbrel, whose sales rose 10 percent to $1.48 billion, helped by price increases. On a conference call with analysts, Amgen Chief Financial Officer David Meline said the company was looking at a number of interesting prospects for potential deals on new drugs that could close this year. “We’re in a financial position to be competitive,” he said. Amgen said net profit rose to $1.87 billion, or $2.47 per share, from $1.65 billion, or $2.15 per share, a year ago. Sales of the osteoporosis drug Prolia rose 30 percent to $441 million, sailing past Wall Street estimates of about $388 million. Sales of the multiple myeloma drug Kyprolis jumped 45 percent to $172 million, shy of analysts’ consensus forecast of about $185 million. Sales of Amgen’s potent, expensive new cholesterol fighter Repatha remained anemic at just $27 million, largely held back by insurers refusing to cover the medicine for many patients. The company is expecting data on Repatha later this year and in early 2017 that could encourage more reimbursement by insurers if results show that it reverses plaque buildup in arteries and prevents heart attacks and deaths. Repatha was approved on its ability to significantly lower “bad” LDL cholesterol.

NICE said it should only be used if treatment with systemic immunotherapies was not suitable and as long as Amgen provided it at an agreed — but undisclosed — price discount. Imlygic uses a herpes simplex virus, the type that causes cold sores, which has been modified to only infect cancer cells. It is injected directly into tumours. Until a few years ago, chemotherapy was the only available treatment for patients whose melanoma had spread.

510,AMGN,FDA approves Novartis biosimilar to Amgen's Enbrel,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved Novartis AG’s biosimilar version of Amgen Inc’s arthritis drug Enbrel. The FDA approved the drug, Erelzi, known also as etanercept-szzs, for multiple inflammatory conditions including rheumatoid arthritis and plaque psoriasis, a skin condition. The agency approved the drug as a biosimilar, meaning there are no clinically meaningful differences between Erelzi and Enbrel. But the two drugs are not considered interchangeable and are therefore not called generics. Enbrel is a biologic drug made from living cells. Biologics are more difficult to imitate. The FDA’s ruling followed a unanimous vote by the agency’s advisory panel in July in favor of approval. “We are committed to bringing Erelzi to the U.S. market as soon as possible,” said Carol Lynch, global head of biopharmaceuticals at Novartis’ Sandoz unit in Germany. Enbrel was approved in 1998 and generated more than $5 billion in U.S. sales last year. It works by blocking a protein known as tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, that plays a role in inflammatory conditions. Amgen believes Enbrel has U.S. patent protection until 2029 and is fighting in court to keep Novartis’ drug off the market. The FDA is also weighing approval of Amgen’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s arthritis drug Humira, a TNF inhibitor that last year generated U.S. sales of more than $8 billion.  AbbVie is in turn trying to block Amgen’s drug from reaching the market, saying it has patents in place to protect Humira in the United States until at least 2022.

511,AMGN,Novartis bid to sell new biosimilar crimped by U.S. court battles,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis has won U.S. approval for a copy of Amgen’s blockbuster arthritis drug Enbrel, but the Swiss drugmaker’s bid to muscle in on the medicine’s $4.7 billion in annual U.S. revenue remains blocked by court battles. Novartis’s Sandoz unit said on Tuesday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Erelzi, its biosimilar copy of Enbrel, for rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and other diseases. Yet Erelzi remains stuck in the starting blocks because U.S. courts have ruled makers of biosimilars must wait 180 days after winning FDA approval before beginning sales of the near-copies. [tinyurl.com/he4govy] That could delay Erelzi’s sales launch until March 2017. Amgen is also waging an aggressive patent war, seeking to fend off Novartis’s incursion on Enbrel’s turf by arguing in U.S. federal court its drug has patent protection until 2029. “We are fully committed to bringing Erelzi to U.S. patients and payers as soon as possible,” Novartis said in a statement, adding: “However, we cannot speculate on product commercial availability.” Biosimilars aim to copy biologic products made inside living cells. Novartis, whose first biosimilar Zarxio was approved last year after a separate court fight with Amgen, is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in biosimilar manufacturing in Austria and France to make cheaper biotech copies of brand-name drugs. The Basel-based company is betting these copies will be irresistible for insurers, healthcare systems and governments aiming to contain costs.  In Erelzi’s case, the prize is big as Enbrel was the world’s fifth-biggest selling medicine in 2014. In trying to accelerate sales, Novartis has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the ruling by a U.S. federal appeals court forcing biosimilar makers to wait six months after FDA approval. [tinyurl.com/jncdnhx] Meanwhile, Amgen’s battle to prolong patents it maintains shield Enbrel for another 13 years is far from resolved. In an Aug. 11 ruling, a U.S. federal judge in New Jersey blocked Sandoz from selling its version.  While court documents indicate Novartis and Amgen have struck a pact over the matter, their agreement has been sealed by U.S. District Judge Claire Cecchi and is not public.  “We will not comment on the pending litigation at this time,” Novartis said in a statement. However, the patent fight could take months or years to resolve. Cecchi has released a schedule for hearings, with a potential trial due to begin only in April 2018.

516,AMGN,Amgen cholesterol drug reduces arterial plaque buildup: study,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said on Tuesday its potent new cholesterol fighter, Repatha, met the primary and secondary goals of a study designed to show it can decrease plaque buildup in heart arteries of patients already taking widely used statin drugs, such as Lipitor. The biotechnology company, whose shares were up 1.6 percent, will present detailed data from the study at a major heart conference in November. Repatha belongs to an expensive new class of injectable drugs that dramatically lower levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol. The new medicines have a list price of more than $14,000 a year. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi sell a rival drug called Praluent. They are far more expensive than statins, which are almost all now available in cheap generic versions. Health insurers and other companies that negotiate prescription drug usage have been slow to cover the new medicines without evidence that they actually reduce heart attacks and deaths as statins do. Data from large studies expected to show that is expected next year. “One year after the FDA approved Repatha, nearly two-thirds of patients prescribed Repatha are still being denied access,” Amgen research chief Sean Harper said in a statement. If the new drugs, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, can halt or significantly reverse atherosclerosis, that could be a strong indicator they will be able to reduce heart attack risk. “Atherosclerosis is the major underlying cause of cardiovascular disease, which remains the leading cause of death worldwide,” Harper said. In the 78-week study of 968 heart patients already on optimum statin therapy, Repatha lowered the percentage of atheroma volume in coronary arteries and demonstrated some plaque regression. Amgen shares were up $2.77 at $174.15 on the Nasdaq in late morning.

518,AMGN,FDA approves Amgen's copy of AbbVie arthritis drug Humira,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Amgen Inc’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s top-selling arthritis drug, Humira. The drug, Amjevita, known also as adalimumab-atto, was approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, psoriasis and other conditions. Amjevita is the fourth biosimilar to be approved by the FDA and is expected to be sold at a discount to the original drug. Last month the agency approved Novartis AG’s biosimilar version of Amgen’s arthritis drug, Enbrel. Unlike generics, which are interchangeable with their branded counterparts, biosimilars approved by the FDA to date are not considered interchangeable and therefore are not called generic. The FDA has determined, however, that there is no clinically meaningful difference between the two products. In approving the drug the FDA followed the advice of its advisory panel, which in July voted unanimously that the drug was similar in safety and effectiveness to the original. The approvals come amid a heated national debate about the rising price of prescription drugs. AbbVie is trying to block Amgen’s drug from reaching the market, saying it has patents in place to protect Humira in the United States until at least 2022. Amgen could introduce the drug before its patent dispute with AbbVie is resolved but risks facing triple damages from an unfavorable court ruling. Still, some analysts expect the drug to be available well before 2022 and see sales of Humira falling as much as 18 percent in 2019. Last year Humira generated U.S. sales of more than $8 billion. Amgen, in turn, believes Enbrel has patent protection until 2029 and is fighting in court to keep Novartis’s biosimilar, Erelzi, off the market.

520,AMGN,UPDATE 3-Amgen's multiple myeloma drug falls short in new-patient study,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said on Tuesday its multiple myeloma drug, Kyprolis, did not fare better than Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd’s older therapy Velcade in a study involving patients who had not yet been treated for the disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has already approved Kyprolis for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have previously undergone treatment. Patients treated with Kyprolis did not show a statistically significant improvement in slowing the cancer’s progression compared with those given Velcade in the late-stage study. Expectations of peak annual sales of about $2.3 billion for Kyprolis are now likely to cool, particularly since newly diagnosed patients constitute the largest market in terms of the number of patients and duration of therapy, some analysts said. Multiple myeloma, a type of aggressive and incurable blood cancer that develops in the bone marrow, kills about 12,600 people annually and will be diagnosed in about 30,000 Americans this year, according to the American Cancer Society. Baird analyst Brian Skorney said approval for previously untreated patients was “off the table” for now. The head-to-head study tested Kyprolis against the older Velcade in patients who were also given the chemothereutic agent melphalan and the immunosuppressant prednisone, and were deemed to be ineligible for stem-cell transplants. On a conference call with analysts, the company and experts said the “treatment landscape” for multiple myeloma was evolving dramatically and that melphalan/prednisone-based regimens were now rarely used due to their low efficacy and high toxicity.  Dr. Andrzej Jakubowiak, who was involved in the development of the Amgen drug, said on the call that the study was not the ideal way to evaluate Kyprolis in previously untreated patients. Amgen, whose shares were down 1.2 percent at $171.45, said it would continue to explore the drug’s benefit in combination with other agents. Kyprolis is also being tested in a separate late-stage trial in combination with Celgene Corp’s Revlimid and the steroid dexamethasone, or KRd, in this “front-line setting.” Jakubowiak said KRd was his first choice for previously untreated patients, and the results of the melphalan/prednisone study would not change this. Kyprolis has already been shown to be superior to Velcade, which is expected to go generic in 2017, in the later stages of multiple myeloma. Kyprolis faces greater competitive pressure as newer entrants in the multiple myeloma market gain traction, including Johnson & Johnson’s Darzalex, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s Empliciti and Takeda’s Ninlaro. The Amgen drug generated $172 million in revenue in the second quarter.

521,AMGN,"Amgen, Arrowhead team up on gene-therapies for heart disease","(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said on Thursday it would buy a stake in Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc and collaborate with the company to develop gene-silencing therapies for heart disease. Arrowhead will get $35 million up front and a $21.5 million injection from Amgen that will give the world’s No. 1 biotech company by market value an equity stake of 4.5 percent. Pasadena, California-based Arrowhead will also eligible for up to $617 million in further milestone and equity payments. Shares of the company, whose shareholders include BlackRock Inc, Novartis AG  and JPMorgan Chase & Co, rose as much as 15 percent to $8.09 in early trading. Arrowhead, along with competitors such as Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc, Ionis Pharmaceuticals Inc   and privately held Quark Pharmaceuticals, focuses on ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi), which aims to silence certain genes to curb the production of disease-causing proteins.  RNAi has long interested drug developers, but has frequently met with clinical failure. Existing drugs, including monoclonal antibodies, work by trying to inactivate disease-causing proteins by binding to them. The license and collaboration deal includes two agreements, under which Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen will take charge of clinical development and commercialization. Under the first agreement, Amgen will get an exclusive global license to Arrowhead’s ARC-LPA program, which has not been tested in humans.  The RNAi drug is designed to reduce elevated levels of a form of cholesterol called Lp(a) that raises the risk of heart disease caused by plaque build-up. One in five people inherit high levels of Lp(a), which leads to the gradual narrowing of arteries, limiting blood supply to the heart, brain, kidneys and legs, thereby raising the risk of blood clots, heart attack and stroke. So far, there is no treatment for the condition.  Under the second agreement, Amgen will receive an option to an exclusive global license for a RNAi therapy for an undisclosed cardiovascular target. Amgen has a growing suite of cardiovascular therapies, both on the market and in development.

522,AMGN,"UPDATE 1-Amgen, Arrowhead team up on gene-therapies for heart disease","(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said on Thursday it would buy a stake in Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc and collaborate with the company to develop gene-silencing therapies for heart disease. Arrowhead will get $35 million up front and a $21.5 million injection from Amgen that will give the world’s No. 1 biotech company by market value an equity stake of 4.5 percent. Pasadena, California-based Arrowhead will also eligible for up to $617 million in further milestone and equity payments. Shares of the company, whose shareholders include BlackRock Inc, Novartis AG  and JPMorgan Chase & Co, rose as much as 15 percent to $8.09 in early trading. Arrowhead, along with competitors such as Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc, Ionis Pharmaceuticals Inc   and privately held Quark Pharmaceuticals, focuses on ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi), which aims to silence certain genes to curb the production of disease-causing proteins.  RNAi has long interested drug developers, but has frequently met with clinical failure. Existing drugs, including monoclonal antibodies, work by trying to inactivate disease-causing proteins by binding to them. The license and collaboration deal includes two agreements, under which Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen will take charge of clinical development and commercialization. Under the first agreement, Amgen will get an exclusive global license to Arrowhead’s ARC-LPA program, which has not been tested in humans.  The RNAi drug is designed to reduce elevated levels of a form of cholesterol called Lp(a) that raises the risk of heart disease caused by plaque build-up. One in five people inherit high levels of Lp(a), which leads to the gradual narrowing of arteries, limiting blood supply to the heart, brain, kidneys and legs, thereby raising the risk of blood clots, heart attack and stroke. So far, there is no treatment for the condition.  Under the second agreement, Amgen will receive an option to an exclusive global license for a RNAi therapy for an undisclosed cardiovascular target. Amgen has a growing suite of cardiovascular therapies, both on the market and in development. These include its potent, expensive new cholesterol fighter Repatha, chronic heart failure treatment Corlanor, and omecamtiv mecarbil, which is in the final stages of development.            Amgen announced last September that it would buy biotechnology company Dezima Pharma BV, adding another cholesterol drug to its pipeline. Amgen’s shares were down 0.4 percent at $169.07.

It now expects 2016 adjusted earnings of $11.40 to $11.55 per share, up from its prior view of $11.10 to $11.40. Amgen  slightly raised the low end of its revenue forecast and now expects $22.6 billion to $22.8 billion. The previous low end had been $22.5 billion. Excluding items, Amgen posted adjusted earnings of $3.02 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 23 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A significant reduction in late stage clinical trial expenses and a milestone payment for Japanese approval of the multiple myeloma drug Kyprolis contributed to the earnings beat. Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt called the quarter very solid. “I think they’ve now beaten in six out of the last seven quarters,” Schmidt said. “The cost controls were very good.” While sales of Amgen’s most important medicines came in in-line or slightly below Wall Street expectations, investors may have been disappointed by a lack of growth for the two biggest products, and shares slipped about 1 percent. Sales of the rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel were flat at $1.45 billion despite a 10 percent price increase taken in July, due to intense competition and inventory stocking issues. Sales of infection fighter Neulasta slipped 5 percent to $1.2 billion due to lower demand, roughly in line with analysts’ expectations of about $1.16 billion. The older Neupogen saw sales plunge 36 percent to $183 million due to competition from a cheaper biosimilar from Novartis (NOVN.S). The related drugs Prolia for osteoporosis and XGeva for preventing fractures when cancer has spread to the bones also had sales that fell short of Wall Street estimates. With health insurers waiting for evidence that Amgen’s potent but expensive new cholesterol fighter Repatha can reduce heart attacks before agreeing to pay for it, sales remained constrained at just $40 million for the quarter. Eagerly-awaited results that could loosen those purse springs are expected in the first quarter of 2017. Revenue rose 2 percent to $5.81 billion, edging past Wall Street estimates of $5.73 billion. Net profit rose to $2.02 billion, or $2.68 per share, from $1.86 billion, or $2.44 per share, a year ago. Amgen shares slipped to $158.90 in extended trading from a Nasdaq close at $160.57.

541,AMGN,Amgen cholesterol drug reduces artery-clogging plaque in study,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Amgen Inc’s potent new drug Repatha, when added to statin therapy, not only took “bad” LDL cholesterol down to extremely low levels but caused declines in artery-clogging plaque in a majority of high-risk heart patients after 18 months of treatment, according to data from a clinical trial. Amgen had previously announced the study was a success. But the percentage of patients who experienced a decrease of the substance that is the underlying cause of heart disease and magnitude of plaque regression was revealed at the American Heart Association scientific meeting in New Orleans on Tuesday. The 968-patient trial compared the effect of monthly injections with Repatha plus a cholesterol-lowering statin with statins alone on the plaques that can break off and cause heart attacks. The plaque measurements were collected with an ultrasound probe placed inside the diseased artery. Patients in the study had symptomatic heart disease and blockages of 20 percent to 50 percent in the tested artery. “We saw profound regression,” said Dr. Steven Nissen, head of cardiology at Cleveland Clinic who presented the data. The combination therapy led to a further 60 percent reduction in LDL levels beyond statins alone to an average LDL of a mere 36.6. That translated into a decrease in percent of blockage volume of about 1 percent compared with no change for statins alone. In all, 64.3 percent on the combination therapy experienced plaque regression compared with 52.7 percent with statin monotherapy. “We didn’t know what would happen to disease progression at LDL cholesterol levels when we go to below about 60,” Nissen explained.  For those who began the trial with LDL below 70, the lowest target guideline for high risk patients, 81 percent experienced coronary plaque regression with the addition of Repatha compared with 48 percent for statins alone. Those Repatha patients on average saw LDL levels drop to 24 with a low of about 15. “That’s unbelievable. So when you get down to 24 you’ve got a really high chance of your plaques melting away,” Nissen said. Repatha and Praluent from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi belong to an expensive new class of drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors. They carry a list price of more than $14,000 a year before discounts and rebates. Many heart doctors have been upset by barriers to access to these drugs they encounter from health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, even for their sickest patients who meet all the criteria mandated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. More than 100,000 prescriptions have been written for Repatha in the United States since its approval, but two-thirds of patients are ultimately denied, Amgen said.  “It’s crazy what’s going on. They’ve basically destroyed our capacity to treat our patients with the drugs that we need to treat them with,” said Dr. Seth Baum, president of the American Society for Preventive Cardiology. In the third quarter, Repatha had anemic sales of just $40 million, while Praluent took in $38 million for drugs forecast to be multibillion-dollar products. It is widely believed that payers will not lift reimbursement restrictions until they see results from huge studies designed to show that the new medicines cut the risk of heart attacks and death in addition to their ability to slash LDL levels. The Repatha outcomes data is expected in early 2017. But the plaque regression data unveiled on Tuesday is likely a strong indictor that those trials will be positive. “These findings suggest that the large clinical outcome trials currently underway are likely to show major benefits,” said Dr. Stephen Nicholls, one of the study’s lead directors.

545,AMGN,"Amgen, Novartis aim for big, crowded migraine market after new drug data","(Reuters) - Amgen Inc and Novartis said late on Wednesday that episodic migraine sufferers reported fewer debilitating headaches per month after using the companies’ investigational drug erenumab, compared to trial participants who got a placebo. The companies are racing rivals including Eli Lilly, Alder Biopharmaceuticals, Allergan and Teva Pharmaceuticals to have a new, more effective migraine treatment approved by U.S. and European regulators.  Novartis anticipates filing for approval of erenumab, also known as AMG 334, next year, and will now discuss the latest data will regulators, it said. In a second late-stage study of Amgen and Novartis’s protein-blocking migraine drug, patients receiving once monthly 70 milligram doses experienced a reduction of 3.2 days from baseline in monthly migraine days, while those on 140 milligram experienced reduction of 3.7 days.  Those in the placebo experienced a 1.8-day reduction, the companies said in separate releases about the study, in which patients were experiencing an average of 8.3 migraine days per month. Analysts said this latest data underscored results from earlier studies and builds on additional trials that the companies have conducted with erenumab against chronic migraine, another form of the condition.  Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford, in a note on Thursday, forecast $1.5 billion in peak sales for the drug, with estimates for Novartis reaping about $440 million annually from 2020. Under the collaboration agreement, Amgen holds sales rights for the United States, Canada and Japan, while Novartis would sell the drug in Europe and the rest of the world.   Amgen said patients received the injectable drug once a month for six months. Worldwide, about 90 percent of people diagnosed with migraine have episodic migraine characterized by up to 14 migraine days a month, the company said.

546,AMGN,"UPDATE 1-Amgen, Novartis aim for big, crowded migraine market after new drug data","(Reuters) - Amgen Inc and Novartis said late on Wednesday that episodic migraine sufferers reported fewer debilitating headaches per month after using the companies’ investigational drug erenumab, compared to trial participants who got a placebo. The companies are racing rivals including Eli Lilly, Alder Biopharmaceuticals, Allergan and Teva Pharmaceuticals to have a new, more effective migraine treatment approved by U.S. and European regulators.  Novartis anticipates filing for approval of erenumab, also known as AMG 334, next year, and will now discuss the latest data will regulators, it said. In a second late-stage study of Amgen and Novartis’s protein-blocking migraine drug, patients receiving once monthly 70 milligram doses experienced a reduction of 3.2 days from baseline in monthly migraine days, while those on 140 milligram experienced reduction of 3.7 days.  Those in the placebo experienced a 1.8-day reduction, the companies said in separate releases about the study, in which patients were experiencing an average of 8.3 migraine days per month. Analysts said this latest data underscored results from earlier studies and builds on additional trials that the companies have conducted with erenumab against chronic migraine, another form of the condition.  Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford, in a note on Thursday, forecast $1.5 billion in peak sales for the drug, with estimates for Novartis reaping about $440 million annually from 2020. Under the collaboration agreement, Amgen holds sales rights for the United States, Canada and Japan, while Novartis would sell the drug in Europe and the rest of the world.   Amgen said patients received the injectable drug once a month for six months. Worldwide, about 90 percent of people diagnosed with migraine have episodic migraine characterized by up to 14 migraine days a month, the company said. Chronic migraine sufferers have at least 15 migraine days per month. Amgen’s shares, which closed at $147.23 in regular trading, were up marginally after the market close on Wednesday.

The submission is based on the results of a late-stage study that showed Amgen and Allergan’s ABP 215 was as safety and effective as Avastin in patients with the most common form of lung cancer. Avastin is also approved for use by patients with cancer of the colon, kidney, ovarian and breast. It generated sales of about $5 billion in the first nine months of this year. The drug is a biologic, which are manufactured in living cells and then extracted and purified.

548,AMGN,"Sanofi, Regeneron lose bid to overturn Amgen win in patent case","(Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday refused to throw out a court verdict upholding two Amgen Inc patents related to the company’s cholesterol drug, a defeat for Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, which make a rival drug. In an October 2014 lawsuit, Amgen had sought to stop Paris-based Sanofi and Tarrytown, New York-based Regeneron from selling Praluent, a drug intended to lower bad LDL cholesterol by blocking a protein known as PCSK9. Amgen makes a rival drug called Repatha, and it said Praluent infringed the Thousand Oaks, California-based company’s patents related to the protein. A jury found Amgen’s patents valid in March. Following that verdict, Sanofi and Regeneron moved for U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson, who is presiding over the case, to overturn the verdict and order a new trial. She denied that motion on Tuesday. Regeneron shares were down 2.6 percent in after-hours trading, and Amgen shares rose 1.6 percent. “The court’s ruling today is an important step in this case and confirms the jury’s finding that the patents which protect Repatha are valid and infringed by Sanofi,” Amgen spokeswoman Kristen Davis said in an email. Sanofi spokeswoman Ashleigh Koss said in an email that the company was disappointed with the ruling. “It is our longstanding position that Amgen’s asserted patent claims are invalid, and we intend to appeal today’s ruling,” she said. Regeneron, which developed Praluent in partnership with Sanofi, could not immediately be reached for comment. Damages have yet to be set, and Robinson has not decided whether to block Sanofi and Regeneron from selling Praluent. The defendants said after the verdict that they planned to appeal to the U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which reviews patent disputes. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Praluent and Repatha to reduce bad cholesterol in 2015. The drugs are more costly than other treatments targeting bad cholesterol, with a list price topping $14,000 annually.

553,AMGN,Regeneron CEO says Amgen not putting patients first in patent dispute,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Chief Executive Len Schleifer on Monday ripped into Amgen Inc for its insistence on blocking sales of a rival Regeneron cholesterol drug while the appeals process in a patent infringement case plays out. A federal judge last week handed Regeneron and its partner Sanofi a stunning setback by banning sales of their LDL-lowering medicine Praluent, finding it infringed patents held by Amgen on its Repatha cholesterol drug. Regeneron and Sanofi were given 30 days before the ban takes effect to give them time to appeal. That was extended to 45 days on Monday. Speaking at the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, Schleifer said Amgen had refused a request to delay any ban of Praluent sales until the appeal is heard, even though the judge in her ruling had said competition among the two drugs was in the public interest. “If they really cared about patients they wouldn’t rip this drug from patients,” the outspoken Schleifer said. “To say that you cannot wait, is that putting patients first? It’s no small wonder that our industry isn’t beloved,” he continued. “If this industry is to survive, we have got to do the right thing by patients ... and still adequately reward our investors,” Schleifer said. Earlier at the conference, Amgen CEO Robert Bradway reiterated that his company intended to defend its patents. He declined to say whether Amgen would consider a settlement in the case. Sanofi and Regeneron had no right to sell Praluent, Amgen said in an emailed statement.  Amgen also said the companies were afforded a full and fair opportunity to challenge the validity of Amgen’s patents at trial and the jury determined Amgen’s patents to be valid. The expensive injectable drugs from both companies dramatically lower “bad” LDL cholesterol by blocking a protein called PCSK9. Both companies are expecting data this year that is likely to show that the drugs also cut the risk of heart attacks and deaths. Amgen’s Bradway said he does not expect that data to be added to the Repatha label until 2018, and Amgen would not be allowed to promote those heart benefits until they are in the label. Without proof that the drugs prevent heart attacks, health insurers have been denying payment for three quarters of Repatha prescriptions written, Amgen said. The drug had just $40 million in third quarter sales. Amgen said if all Repatha prescriptions written had been filled it would be well on its way to being a $1 billion drug. Regeneron has run into similar resistance to Praluent with insurers refusing to pay for it.

The company also announced that its Repatha cholesterol drug reduced the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cardiac death in a huge, long-awaited study of patients with heart disease, sending its shares up nearly 3 percent to $164 in late trade. “It’s obviously a positive, but there’s a lot more we want to know about the details,” Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt said. The positive heart data is seen as necessary to unlocking the blockbuster sales potential of the expensive medicine, as health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) have been rejecting 75 percent of prescriptions written while awaiting concrete proof of the drug’s health benefits. Repatha, which dramatically lowers “bad” LDL cholesterol, had sales of just $58 million in the fourth quarter. For 2017, Amgen forecast adjusted earnings of $11.80 to $12.60 per share, with a midpoint below Wall Street estimates of $12.46, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company sees full-year sales of $22.3 billion to $23.1 billion, while analysts on average are looking for $23.3 billion. Amgen Chief Financial Officer David Meline said the wide forecast range in part reflects uncertainly over how quickly Repatha gains more reimbursements as a result of the new data. The company also expects unfavorable foreign exchange rates to lower full-year earnings by about 20 cents per share, and said it will not fully benefit from Enbrel price increases due to discounts negotiated with insurers and PBMs. However, Amgen has a track record of exceeding its initial forecasts.

The S&P; 500 traded at levels it was six weeks ago, losing steam as investors focus on Trump’s priorities, such as restricting travel to the United States and rewriting trade deals. Markets had rallied following Trump’s Nov. 8 election win on the expectation that tax cuts, deregulation and a fiscal stimulus would accelerate economic growth. “The market had only priced in the potentially good type of policies like tax cuts,” said Arian Vojdani, investment strategist at MV Financial in Bethesda, Maryland. “Now we’re seeing potential protectionist and populist sentiment really come out and take the front seat. That could be bad for the world economy and that’s why markets are taking a step back.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 7.36 points, or 0.04 percent, to 19,883.58, the S&P; 500 gained 0.5 points, or 0.02 percent, to 2,280.05 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 8.51 points, or 0.15 percent, to 5,634.14. Trump reiterated his concerns about the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) deal and said he would like to speed up talks to either renegotiate or replace the deal. Investors are also wary of the consequences of other of Trump’s comments, including labeling a refugee swap agreement with staunch ally Australia as a “dumb deal” and that “nothing is off the table” in dealing with Iran after it test-fired a ballistic missile. Earnings of S&P; 500 companies are estimated to have risen 7.5 percent during the last quarter of 2016 - the most in nine quarters, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data. Economic data showed the U.S. labor market continues to tighten, while productivity is still weak. Facebook fell 1.7 percent to $130.96 after hitting a record high of $135.49. Its results on Wednesday beat earnings and revenue expectations. Macy’s shares rose 5.2 percent to $30.73. The New York Post reported the retailer’s outgoing CEO Terry Lundgren has become open to offers from potential buyers. The stock hit a high of $31.06 and trading volume was 1.6 times the average over the last 10 days. Mead Johnson Nutrition jumped 22.3 percent after Reckitt Benckiser said it was in advanced talks to buy the company for $16.7 billion. Ralph Lauren dropped 12.2 percent to $76.71 after it said Chief Executive Officer Stefan Larsson would leave following differences with the company’s founder and chairman.

Trump in a meeting with key lawmakers said he would like to speed up talks to either renegotiate or replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Investors are also assessing possible consequences of Trump’s other comments, including labeling a refugee swap agreement with staunch ally Australia as a “dumb deal” and putting Iran “on notice” for firing a ballistic missile. U.S. equities had enjoyed a frenetic post-election rally on bets that Trump would usher in an era of growth, stimulating the economy through tax cuts, simpler regulations and higher infrastructure spending. However, the rally has been unraveling in the past weeks as Trump’s priorities, such as imposing restriction on travel to the United States and withdrawing from a trade deal, have caused uncertainty and made it hard for investors to have conviction in the equity market. “What you have is a tug-of-war between near-term positives in terms of economic data and earnings season juxtaposed against the confusion over what’s important in the first 100 days of the new administration and when will we get to see things like tax reforms,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Equity Capital Markets in New York. Earnings of S&P; 500 companies are estimated to have risen 7.5 percent - the best growth in nine quarters, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

578,AMGN,"UPDATE 2-Regeneron, Sanofi win stay of U.S. order blocking cholesterol drug sales","(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday stayed an order that would have blocked Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA from selling their cholesterol drug, Praluent, while they appeal the order. A federal judge earlier had blocked sales of the drug after rival Amgen Inc won a trial in which it accused them of infringing its patents. The order would have taken effect on Feb. 21. Regeneron general counsel Joseph LaRosa said in a statement the company would continue to defend its case through the appeal process. “We continue to believe the facts and controlling law support our position in this case,” he said. Sanofi spokeswoman Ashleigh Koss said in an email the company was pleased the order had been stayed, “giving patients in the U.S. continued access to this important medicine during the appeal process. “It is our longstanding position that Amgen’s asserted patent claims are invalid,” she said. Amgen spokeswoman Kristen Davis said in an email that the company respected the court’s decision but was confident it would prevail against Regeneron and Sanofi’s appeal.     Amgen was down 1.9 percent in after-hours trading. Regeneron was up 2.7 percent in after-hours trading and U.S.-traded shares of Sanofi were down 1.9 percent. Amgen had sought to block Praluent sales in an October 2014 lawsuit against Paris-based Sanofi and Tarrytown, New York-based Regeneron. It said Praluent, a drug intended to lower “bad” LDL cholesterol by blocking a protein known as PCSK9, infringed its patents related to the protein. Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen makes a rival drug called Repatha. A jury found Amgen’s patents valid last March. U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson in Delaware, who presided over the case, granted a motion last month by Amgen to bar sales of Praluent.  Regeneron and Sanofi petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to stay that order while they appealed. Multiple doctors submitted briefs in support of a stay, saying patients would be harmed if sales of Praluent were halted.  The companies could still decide to reach a settlement that would give Amgen royalties on Praluent sales. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Praluent and Repatha to reduce bad cholesterol in 2015. The drugs are more costly than other cholesterol drugs, with a list price topping $14,000 annually.

586,AMGN,Data on heart benefits of Amgen drug is key to unlocking sales,"(Reuters) - Data that should help unlock the sales potential of a potent new cholesterol medicine will be unveiled at the American College of Cardiology meeting this week as the future of the only rival drug rests with the courts in an ongoing patent dispute.  Highly anticipated results from a 27,500-patient trial of Amgen Inc’s Repatha will be presented on Friday at the meeting in Washington, informing doctors and investors of just how much the expensive injectable drug cut the risk of heart attack, stroke and death in people with heart disease already taking maximum doses of cholesterol-lowering statins, such as Lipitor. Insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have been rejecting some 75 percent of prescriptions written for the new medicines while awaiting proof of their clinical value. They prefer to keep patients on cheap, generic statins already shown to prevent heart attacks. Repatha and a competing drug, Praluent from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc  and Sanofi SA , have list prices of over $14,000 a year, before discounts and rebates.  They belong to a class of medicines called PCSK9 inhibitors that were approved on their ability to dramatically lower “bad” LDL cholesterol. But with a raging debate over high U.S. prescription drug prices, there has been pressure for hard data to justify the cost of medicines that may have to be taken for life. The high rejection rate has severely constrained sales of the potential multibillion-dollar products, which were just $58 million for Repatha and $41 million for Praluent in the fourth quarter.         Rejections have frustrated cardiologists trying to get these new drugs for patients whose cholesterol remains dangerously high despite taking the most potent statins, and for those unable to tolerate them. “What I care about is there are patients for whom the PCSK9 is absolutely vital,” said Dr. Leslie Cho, head of preventive cardiology and cardiac rehabilitation at the Cleveland Clinic.  Industry analysts said they hope to see at least a 20 percent reduction of major adverse heart events from Repatha, and that anything less might be viewed as disappointing to investors.  Dr. Jorge Plutzky, director of the vascular disease prevention program at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, said a risk reduction greater than 20 percent would be very hard for insurers to ignore. But, he added, “any statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular events would be important to me.” Amgen shares rose 3 percent last month, when it announced the Repatha trial had succeeded without providing details. Regeneron expects to have results from Praluent’s large cardiovascular outcomes trial by year end. Whether Praluent will still be available depends on an appeal of a U.S. court ruling that found it infringed Repatha patents.  Praluent was allowed to remain on the market pending the  appeal decision, which could take into account the benefit to society of competition that lowers drug prices. New prescriptions have been higher for Repatha since the January court ruling. In the week ended March 3, there were 1,288 written for Repatha and 892 for Praluent, according to data reported by analysts.  But interviews with physicians found they were not taking Praluent’s uncertain future into account when selecting which  to prescribe. Those decisions were driven by preferences of individual patients’ health insurer or PBM, they said. Insurers negotiate discounts with each drugmaker and then offer the cheaper one to patients with a lower co-payment.  Express Scripts Holding Co , the nation’s largest PBM, declined to speculate on how much clinical benefit must be demonstrated before making it available to more patients.

Highly anticipated results from a 27,500-patient trial of Amgen Inc’s Repatha will be presented on Friday at the meeting in Washington, informing doctors and investors of just how much the expensive injectable drug cut the risk of heart attack, stroke and death in people with heart disease already taking maximum doses of cholesterol-lowering statins, such as Lipitor. Insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have been rejecting some 75 percent of prescriptions written for the new medicines while awaiting proof of their clinical value.

Amgen (AMGN.O) was the largest drag on both the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq, down 6.4 percent at $168.61, after the extent of a cholesterol drug’s benefits in a highly anticipated study disappointed investors, even if it cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes by over 20 percent in patients with heart disease.

Indexes were little changed for a second day even if the Nasdaq Composite touched a record intraday high. Analysts say investors are expecting a catalyst to thrust stocks higher after bets on President Trump’s promises of tax cuts and a fiscal stimulus drove Wall Street to all-time highs on a weeks-long rally. “Investors are moving from sector to sector dependent on where the U.S. dollar is, comments from the White House on the health care act, and earnings,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. “The 10-year (benchmark U.S. Treasury note yield) dipped below 2.5 percent and financials pull back while utilities get bid. This churn is a way for the market to consolidate.” Analysts increasingly worry that the Trump administration is spending too much of its political capital in an effort to pass a Republican-proposed healthcare bill, which may leave it wanting for support when it tries to reform the tax code.

598,AMGN,US STOCKS-Wall St little changed as healthcare stocks weigh,"* Tiffany rises on 4th-qtr profit beat * Adobe up on strong quarterly results * Dow up 0.06 pct, S&P; up 0.05 pct, Nasdaq down 0.03 pct   (Updates to open) By Anya George Tharakan March 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little changed on Friday as a slide in Amgen dragged down the healthcare sector, offsetting gains in technology shares. The S&P; 500 healthcare sector was off 0.4 percent, dragged down by a 6.3 percent drop in Amgen. Analysts said data from a large study testing the impact of Amgen’s cholesterol drug on the heart was weaker than expected. Amgen was also the biggest drag on the broader S&P; 500 index and the Nasdaq. However, ten of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were higher, with the technology sector up 0.21 percent. Adobe gave the biggest push to the sector, rising 6.2 percent after the Photoshop maker’s quarterly results beat analysts’ expectations. At 9:41 a.m. ET (1341 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was up 13.29 points, or 0.06 percent, at 20,947.84, the S&P; 500 was up 1.25 points, or 0.05 percent, at 2,382.63 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.58 points, or 0.03 percent, at 5,899.18. “Today it appears as though we’re going to have another day like yesterday, where the market is looking for something substantial to create the next move,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Much of the week’s trading has been predicated on a widely expected quarter-point interest rate hike that the Federal Reserve delivered on Wednesday. The main indexes are on track to mark slight gains since Monday as markets rallied on the Fed’s less hawkish-than-expected rate hike outlook. Investors are also keeping a close eye on the Group of 20 meeting in Germany, where financial leaders and central banks discuss the world economy. Tiffany’s shares rose 3 percent to $92.73, after the company posted a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit, boosted by strong demand for its high-end jewelry in Japan and China. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,535 to 1,050. On the Nasdaq, 1,353 issues fell and 989 advanced. The S&P; 500 index showed 39 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 64 new highs and 31 new lows.

599,AMGN,"RPT-Amgen cholesterol drug cuts heart attack, stroke risk more than 20 pct-study","(Repeats story without any changes to text) By Bill Berkrot WASHINGTON, March 17 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc’s Repatha drug cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes by over 20 percent in patients with heart disease, demonstrating a clear clinical benefit beyond its ability to slash “bad” LDL cholesterol levels, data from a huge study known as Fourier showed on Friday. Results from the highly anticipated 27,564-patient Fourier study should help remove some barriers to patient access from health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, who have been rejecting some 75 percent of prescriptions written for the costly medicine. Repatha cut the combined risk of heart attacks, strokes and heart-related death by 20 percent compared with a placebo in patients already on high doses of cholesterol-lowering statins, such at Lipitor. Most trial subjects had had a prior heart attack or stroke. Separately, Repatha cut heart attacks by 27 percent and stroke by 21 percent. In the second year of the study, the results were more pronounced, with a 35 percent reduction in heart attack risk and a 24 percent decrease in stroke risk. “Just like in statin trials the benefit appeared to grow over time,” said Dr. Marc Sabatine, the study’s lead researcher, who presented the data at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in Washington. “As a clinician this is very big news. We have another tool to significantly reduce heart attacks and stokes. That’s a big win,” said Sabatine from Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. There was no difference in cardiovascular death in the two groups, which may disappoint some investors. Researchers said that may be due in part to the study’s length, with a median duration of 26 months. Longer term, Sabatine said, there could be a reduction in deaths as well. The trial’s primary composite goal included need for artery clearing procedures and hospitalization due to chest pains from angina in addition to heart attack, stroke and death. On that measure, the overall risk reduction was 15 percent, primarily due to no difference from placebo in angina hospitalizations. Repatha, injected either once or twice a month, lowered LDL by about 60 percent to a median of 30, with a quarter of patients getting below 20, researchers reported. Earlier guidelines set an LDL target of 70 for such high risk patients. There were no reports concerning safety issues. Incidence of cognitive decline, cataracts, new onset diabetes and muscle-related side effects were similar to the placebo group. The results should loosen the purse strings of insurers  reluctant to pay for a drug with a list price of over $14,000 a year before discounts, given the high cost of treating strokes and heart attacks. “To see a more than 20 percent risk reduction for stroke was really exciting,” said Amgen research chief Sean Harper. Amgen said it is taking steps to remove onerous barriers to patient access, including a plan under which it would offer to refund Repatha costs for all eligible patients who have a heart attack or stroke. Repatha and rival Praluent, from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  and Sanofi, work by blocking the PCSK9 protein that prevents LDL being removed from the blood. “The class is likely to grow to at least a $3 billion to $5 billion worldwide market over the next 5 plus years,” forecast   RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee. Due to the high rejection rate, sales have been anemic - just $58 million for Repatha and $41 million for Praluent in the fourth quarter. Sabatine said he would like to see Repatha tested in other high risk patients, such as those with type 2 diabetes without prior history of heart attack, which could substantially increase the market. “As a society we need to move to modifying these risk factors earlier in life to not only prevent recurrent events but to prevent first events,” he said.

601,AMGN,"Sanofi, Regeneron sue Amgen to protect eczema drug from patent claims","BOSTON (Reuters) - Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc have filed a lawsuit seeking a court order declaring that their eczema drug Dupixent, awaiting a U.S. approval decision, does not infringe an Amgen Inc  patent for a failed asthma treatment. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Boston on Monday, was intended to preempt one expected to be brought by Amgen, which has previously sued Sanofi and Regeneron over their rival cholesterol drug Praluent. “Sanofi and Regeneron wish to eliminate any potential obstacle Amgen might seek to raise against the planned U.S. commercialization of Dupixent,” the plaintiffs said in the lawsuit. Amgen said in a statement on Tuesday that the company “does have a patent covering the product and we will defend our patent rights.” The suit came two months after a federal judge in Delaware blocked Sanofi and Regeneron from selling Praluent because it was found to infringe Amgen’s Repatha patent. Praluent was allowed to remain on the market during the appeals process. Sanofi and Regeneron argue they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing Dupixent. The injectable drug, known chemically as dupilumab, is seen as a critically important future growth driver for both companies, with annual sales forecast to exceed $5 billion by 2023, according to Thomson Reuters data. The companies have called Dupixent a “game-changer” in  moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, a type of eczema that causes extreme itching. The lawsuit said plans were under way to begin selling Dupixent as soon as it wins approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a decision due next week. The patent at issue in the lawsuit was issued to Amgen in the 2000s, when it was attempting to develop an asthma treatment. Amgen abandoned development of the drug following disappointing results, the lawsuit said. The complaint said that in recent days lawyers for Sanofi and Regeneron learned Amgen had hired lawyers to pursue patent infringement litigation related to Amgen’s work on that treatment. Dupilumab is also being tested for asthma and other indications. “We took this proactive step to protect the value of our innovative therapy Dupixent and ensure access of this important medicine for physicians and patients,” Sanofi said in a statement on Tuesday.

612,AMGN,Cost controls help offset lower Amgen first-quarter drug sales,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) on Wednesday reported higher-than-expected first-quarter profit as cost controls helped offset a sharp drop in sales of Enbrel, its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis drug. But an earnings beat based on lower expenses rather than sales growth did not please investors and Amgen shares fell 3 percent to $159.50. Sales of Enbrel, faced with increased competition and slowing growth in the rheumatology and dermatology sectors, dropped 15 percent to $1.18 billion, below Wall Street estimates of about $1.38 billion. Enbrel has traditionally been a growth driver for Amgen, although the company had cautioned that pricing pressure would likely hit the franchise this year. “The biggest weakness on the top line was definitely Enbrel. It’s in decline,” said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt.  Commercial operations chief Tony Hooper said Amgen was optimistic Enbrel sales would rebound in coming quarters and be “a significant cash-flow generator for many years to come.”   Total sales fell 1 percent to $5.5 billion, shy of analysts’ consensus estimates of $5.6 billion. Excluding items, Amgen had adjusted earnings of $3.15 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 15 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Amgen maintained its full-year revenue forecast of $22.3 billion to $23.1 billion. It raised the low end of its adjusted 2017 earnings forecast by 20 cents to $12.00 per share, keeping  the top end at $12.60. Total operating expenses fell 8 percent to $2.87 billion. The company’s potent new cholesterol drug Repatha, faced with reimbursement barriers from insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, had sales of just $49 million. Data showing Repatha significantly cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes, expected to greatly improve payer and physician acceptance of the expensive medicine, did not come out until late in the quarter and was not reflected in the sales for the period. Chief Executive Robert Bradway said the company would work to improve patient access to a medicine that “can prevent hundreds of thousands of needless and tragic events.”   Still, analyst Schmidt said, “it’s not good when your growth franchise is weak, even if it’s early days.” Other key medicines performed better, with sales of osteoporosis drug Prolia rising 21 percent to $425 million, ahead of Wall Street estimates of about $415 million.

Trastuzumab has been a mainstay of Roche’s profit for years and brought in global sales of about $6.7 billion in 2016, but it has been challenged in the last three years by biosimilars which are sold at about a 25 percent discount to the original. India’s Biocon and U.S. firm Mylan, which together sell biosimilars of the drug in over a dozen countries including India, filed a complaint with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) last year alleging Roche misled doctors and regulators to thwart competition to trastuzumab. “Roche adheres to all applicable laws and regulations in countries where it operates,” Roche spokeswoman Shilpika Das said in a statement. “We are fully committed to cooperating with the authorities in India.”  India, with among the highest number of cancer patients in the world, is a big market for trastuzumab, which is indicated to treat certain forms of breast and gastric cancer and which Roche sells under the brand name Herceptin. Globally, the market for trastuzumab is getting increasingly crowded, with analysts saying late on Wednesday that U.S. biotech firm Amgen and partner Allergan are seeking approval for their form of trastuzumab later this year. Roche first launched the drug in India in 2002 and sells it for about 75,000 rupees ($1,170) for a 440 mg vial. In an interim order released on Tuesday, the CCI said it found merit in Biocon and Mylan’s arguments, and ordered its director general to conduct a “detailed investigation” and submit a report within 60 days. Although the order is not final, the investigation could result in penalties, said a lawyer at the Delhi High Court, who declined to be named. Biocon said in a statement that it welcomed the CCI’s order.  Roche, which has been engaged in a legal tussle with Biocon and Mylan since 2014, has the option of filing a petition to contest the order, the lawyer added. In their complaint, Biocon and Mylan allege Roche wrote to doctors, hospitals, and state and federal regulators, misleading them about the safety of efficacy of the biosimilar versions. “When seen collectively in the background of surrounding facts and circumstances, they only appear to be a part of the bigger plan/strategy of Roche Group to eliminate competition posed by biosimilars to Roche’s products in the relevant market,” the CCI said in its order.

Tuesday, June 6 10 a.m. - Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc will ask the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to reverse a court order that blocks them from selling their jointly developed cholesterol drug Praluent on the grounds that it infringes on patents owned by Amgen Inc, which sells a competing drug called Repatha. In January a federal judge in Delaware granted a request by Amgen for an injunction that would block sales of Praluent for 12 years. That injunction has been stayed pending the appeal.

623,AMGN,"Regeneron, Sanofi urge court to reverse ban on cholesterol drug","(Reuters) - A federal appeals court hinted on Tuesday it may let Sanofi AG and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc sell a cholesterol drug Amgen Inc has been trying to block on patent infringement grounds, according to lawyers and analysts who attended oral arguments in the case. Paul Clement, a lawyer for Regeneron and Sanofi, urged the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to reverse a lower court order that would ban sales of their jointly developed drug Praluent for 12 years because it infringed patents owned by Amgen Inc, which makes a competing drug, Repatha. Clement asked the court to invalidate Amgen’s patents because they improperly claim a broad monopoly on an entire category of antibodies, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, that lower “bad” cholesterol levels. Amgen’s lawyer, Daryl Joseffer, argued the injunction was the only fair outcome in the dispute after a jury upheld the validity of Amgen’s patents. He also said Amgen’s patents reflect true innovations that resulted from a $2 billion investment in research and development. Zachary Silbersher, a patent lawyer at Kroub, Silbersher & Kolmykov who is not involved in the case, said the three judges’ questions frequently put Jossefer on the defensive and suggest that they may be “leaning a little toward Regeneron.” Silbersher noted that much of the argument focused on whether the trial judge unfairly handicapped Regeneron and Sanofi by blocking them from presenting certain evidence during the jury trial. That line of questioning suggests the Federal Circuit could order a do-over trial in the case, he said. Umer Raffat, an analyst at the investment banking advisory firm Evercore ISI, agreed the case is “leaning more toward Regeneron” but added that it was “impossible to call with high conviction.” PCSK9 inhibitors like Repatha and Praluent have been shown to dramatically lower “bad” LDL cholesterol and are expected to generate billions in sales. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved both drugs in 2015. Amgen sued Paris-based Sanofi and Tarrytown, New York-based Regeneron in 2014. A federal jury in Delaware upheld the validity of Amgen’s patents in March 2016, prompting U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson to hand down an injunction blocking Praluent sales for 12 years. The sales ban was stayed pending Regeneron and Sanofi’s appeal.",6062017,http://www.reuters.com/article/amgen-regeneron-patent/regeneron-sanofi-urge-court-to-reverse-ban-on-cholesterol-drug-idUSL1N1J320I

627,AMGN,UPDATE 4-U.S. Supreme Court speeds copycat biologic drugs to market,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday cut the time it will take for copycat versions of biologic drugs to get to the market in a pivotal ruling about an expensive class of medicines that can yield billions of dollars in sales for drug companies. The justices, in a 9-0 ruling, overturned a lower court’s decision that had prevented Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG (NOVN.S) from selling its copycat version of California-based Amgen Inc’s (AMGN.O) Neupogen until six months after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved it. The decision has major implications for the pharmaceutical industry because it will dictate how long brand-name makers of biologic drugs can keep near-copies, called biosimilars, off the market. Even the six months at issue in the case can mean hundreds of millions of dollars in sales.  Health insurers expect biosimilars to be cheaper than original brands, like generics, saving consumers billions of dollars each year. Novartis said in a statement that the ruling “will help expedite patient access to life-enhancing treatments.”  Amgen spokeswoman Kelley Davenport said the company was disappointed but “will continue to seek to enforce our intellectual property against those parties that infringe upon our rights.”  The dispute involved a section of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, that created an expedited path for regulatory approval of biosimilars while trying to respect the patent rights of brand-name manufacturers.  Novartis complained that the 2015 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington handed Amgen an extra six months of exclusivity on top of the 12 years already provided under the law. Rising drug prices are a matter of concern for patients and policymakers. President Donald Trump has criticized the pharmaceutical industry over pricing practices, promising to encourage competition and bring down drug costs. Unlike traditional drugs, biologics are made from living cells and cannot be copied exactly to make generic versions. They are used to treat a range of conditions, including Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis, breast cancer and diabetes.  Novartis unit Sandoz in September 2015 began selling Zarxio, the first biosimilar drug to win U.S. regulatory approval. Amgen’s Neupogen and Zarxio boost white blood cell counts in cancer patients to help fight infections. After launch, Zarxio cost 15 percent less than Neupogen at list prices, according to Novartis. Sales of Neupogen, meanwhile, dropped from more than $1 billion in 2015 to $765 million last year, primarily due to competition in the United States, the company said in regulatory filings.  Biologics account for an ever-increasing share of U.S. prescription drug costs, according to an insurer trade group. It cited as an example AbbVie Inc’s Humira, which costs more than $50,000 per year. Amgen sued Sandoz in 2014 in San Francisco federal court alleging patent infringement and violations of the Affordable Care Act provision governing biosimilars.  The companies disagreed on how to apply that law’s requirement that a biosimilar drug maker give the brand-name manufacturer 180 days notice before launching its copycat version.  In July 2015, the appeals court ruled that the 180-day notice must be given after FDA approval, a ruling the Supreme Court reversed on Monday.  Writing for the court, Justice Clarence Thomas said that the decision was not based on policy arguments, but rather, the “plain language” of the biosimilar law itself.  The Trump administration had backed Novartis’ arguments in the case.

Shares of Coherus tumbled 30 percent to $14.47 in morning trading, while Amgen’s shares were up slightly at $164.19. Drug developers including Redwood City, California-based Coherus are racing to make the first biosimilar copy of Neulasta, which generated about $4.6 billion or a fifth of Amgen’s sales last year. Amgen expects biosimilar competition for the drug by the fourth quarter of 2017, it said earlier this year. The FDA last year declined to approve Novartis AG’s copycat for Neulasta, while its decision on Mylan NV and Biocon Ltd’s biosimilar is expected by October. Biotech drugs such as Neulasta are made inside living cells, so it is impossible to make exact generic copies, as is possible with simple pills. As a result, regulators are approving products that are “similar” enough to do the same job. Developing biosimilars requires considerable expertise and is relatively costly, but investment in the field is growing as many blockbuster biotech medicines start to go off patent. Coherus on Monday said the FDA had not asked it to conduct another trial on its Neulasta copy, but instead requested a re-analysis of some existing data with a more sensitive assay. An assay is a tool used to detect a marker of disease or risk in a sample taken from a patient. It would take Coherus up to six months to address the FDA’s concerns, and the FDA could take another six months to review the company’s submission, Coherus Chief Executive Dennis Lanfear said on a call with analysts. Amgen earlier this year filed a lawsuit against Coherus alleging that Coherus poached its employees and encouraged them to use Amgen’s trade secrets to speed up production of biosimilars. Coherus denies the charge. Lanfear was previously Amgen’s vice president of market development, while Coherus’s chief scientific officer once managed Amgen’s analytical R&D; department.

643,AMGN,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Amgen 2nd-quarter profit tops Street view, shares fall","(Corrects to show Repatha heart data released in March, not November, 11th paragraph.) July 25 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc on Tuesday reported higher-than-expected second-quarter profit and raised its 2017 earnings forecast as  growth in newer products helped offset declines in established blockbuster medicines. But the midpoint of the new earnings forecast is 8 cents below analysts’ current estimates and the quarterly results, bolstered by lower expenses and a decreased tax rate, appeared to disappoint investors. Amgen shares fell 2.7 percent to $176 in extended trading from a Nasdaq close at $180.89. Excluding items, Amgen posted adjusted earnings of $3.27 per share, topping analysts’ average expectation by 16 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For the full year, Amgen estimated adjusted earnings of $12.15 to $12.65 per share, up from its prior view of $12.00 to $12.60. The company also tightened its 2017 revenue forecast to $22.5 billion to $23 billion from a range of $22.3 billion to $23.1 billion. Amgen’s biggest product, Enbrel for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, bounced most of the way back from a disappointing first quarter. Sales fell 1 percent to $1.46 billion due to increased competition, beating Wall Street estimates of $1.34 billion. Enbrel sales had fallen 15 percent in the first quarter. Sales of infection fighter Neulasta fell 5 percent to $1.09 billion due to lower demand. But newer products, such as Prolia for osteoporosis, Kyprolis for multiple myeloma, and the potent, but expensive cholesterol fighter Repatha all saw strong growth that exceeded expectations. Prolia sales grew 15 percent to $505 million, while analysts had been expecting about $477.5 million. Kyprolis sales jumped 23 percent to $211 million, topping Wall Street estimates of about $203 million. Repatha appears to be gaining momentum after data in March showed it cut the risk of heart attack, stroke and death in addition to dramatically lowering LDL levels. Sales of $83 million were about $10 million above expectations. The world’s largest biotechnology company by market value said net profit rose to $2.15 billion, or $2.91 per share, from a profit of $1.87 billion, or $2.47 per share, a year ago.

646,AMGN,"Amgen 2nd quarter profit tops Street estimates, raises forecast","July 25 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc on Tuesday reported higher-than-expected second-quarter profit and raised its 2017 earnings forecast as strong growth in newer products helped offset declines in established blockbuster medicines. Lower expenses and a decreased tax rate also bolstered sales growth of just 2 percent. The world’s largest biotechnology company by market value said net profit rose to $2.15 billion, or $2.91 per share, from a profit of $1.87 billion, or $2.47 per share, a year ago. Excluding items, Amgen posted adjusted earnings of $3.27 per share. Analysts on average had expected $3.11, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For the full year, Amgen estimated adjusted earnings of $12.15 to $12.65 per share, up from its prior view of $12.00 to $12.60.

647,AMGN,Amgen gets fast FDA review for adding heart benefits to cholesterol drug label,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said on Thursday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted priority review to the company’s request to add important heart safety data to the label of its expensive injectable cholesterol drug Repatha. The FDA will decide by Dec. 2 whether to allow Amgen to include data from a major clinical trial that showed Repatha significantly cut the risk of heart attack, stroke and death in addition to dramatically lowering bad LDL cholesterol, the company said. Amgen, which cannot promote the heart safety data until it is officially included in the prescribing information, sees the label update as critical to unlocking the value of a medicine seen as having multibillion-dollar sales potential. “We look forward to working with the FDA to update the label for Repatha, enabling us to more broadly educate physicians and patients of the proven impact of Repatha to reduce cardiovascular events,” Amgen research and development chief Sean Harper said in a statement. Repatha has had improving but anemic sales since its approval nearly two years ago on the basis of its LDL-lowering prowess, with second-quarter sales of just $83 million. Insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have put up onerous roadblocks to patient access for the drug, with some 75 percent of prescriptions written being denied. Amgen has said after discounts and rebates Repatha’s net price falls between $7,700 and $11,200 a year. Clinical evidence that the injectable biotech drug does more than just lower LDL was considered necessary for payers to open their pocket books and start authorizing wider use. In the study of more than 27,000 patients called Fourier that was released in March, Repatha cut the combined risk of heart attacks, strokes and heart-related death by 20 percent compared with a placebo in high-risk patients already on high doses of cholesterol-lowering statins, such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor. In the second year of the study, the benefits were more pronounced, with a combined heart attack and stroke risk reduction of 33 percent. Repatha and Praluent, sold by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc  and Sanofi, belong to a new class of medicines called PCSK9 inhibitors that block a protein that stops LDL from being removed from the blood.

651,AMGN,"UPDATE 1-Express Scripts to cover Mylan's EpiPen, exclude rivals","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co said on Monday it would favor drugmaker Mylan Inc’s versions of the EpiPen lifesaving allergy treatment over the allergy auto-injectors of other companies. The nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager said it was excluding alternatives to the auto-injector made by Impax Laboratories Inc, privately held Kaleo and A-S Medication from its widely used list of covered drugs. Express Scripts has been excluding certain medicines from its coverage list or formulary since 2014, citing concern about costs to its health insurers and corporate customers.  By excluding drugs from its coverage list, Express Scripts said it has been better able to negotiate lower prices from drugmakers, and will save customers an estimated $2.5 billion in 2018, up from $1.8 billion this year. Mylan faced severe criticism and congressional and legal investigations last year after it doubled the cost of a pair of EpiPens to around $600, enraging consumers and putting it in the center of the ongoing debate over the high cost of prescription medicines in the United States. It has since offered its own generic version for about $300 in response to the furor. Mylan declined to comment on the Express Scripts decision. Express Scripts added 64 new drugs - including the EpiPen alternatives - to its list of drugs excluded from insurance coverage for 2018. The list determines whether millions of people with private insurance can easily use an insurance co-pay to buy medicine. Another important drug excluded from the company’s coverage this year is Neupogen, an Amgen Inc treatment used to boost infection-fighting white blood cells during chemotherapy. Amgen said retail use of Neupogen through the Express Scripts formulary accounted for only about 1.7 percent of U.S. Neupogen sales in 2016. Express Scripts listed as its “preferred alternatives” to Neupogen the biosimilars Granix and Zarxio, made by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Novartis AG, respectively. Unlike generics of simple pills, it is not possible to manufacture exact copies of complex biotech medicines made from living cells. As a result, less expensive biosimilars must prove they are similar enough in safety and efficacy to be sold as alternatives. “Amgen feels strongly that Neupogen is competitively priced based on its clinical and economic value,” Amgen said in an emailed statement.

Humira, known chemically as adalimumab, is by far the world’s top-selling prescription medicine with second-quarter global sales of $4.7 billion, putting it on track for annual sales exceeding $18 billion. The settlement, which removes a major overhang for AbbVie given its dependence on Humira, sent its shares to an all-time high of $90.95 before settling back to $89.87, up 6 percent. Under terms of the settlement, which ends all pending patent litigation between the companies, AbbVie said it will be entitled to unspecified royalties on sales of Amgen’s biosimilar of Humira. The Humira settlement “adds unexpected royalties during the biosimilar years and indicates that AbbVie’s patents ... are defensible,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said in a research note. The settlement also allows Amgen to begin selling its biosimilar of Humira in Europe on Oct. 16, 2018. “This agreement will allow us to secure a strong foothold in the $4 billion European adalimumab market,” Scott Foraker, head of biosimilars for Amgen, said in a statement. Amgen shares were up 0.7 percent at $186.19. Amgen was the first company to win U.S. approval for a Humira biosimilar, but delayed selling it until the patent situation was resolved. Other companies that also intend to market their own biosimilar versions of Humira are still challenging its patents. “We believe that this could be a leading indicator for other ongoing litigation with adalimumab biosimilar manufacturers,” Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham said. Biosimilars are intended to be less costly versions of expensive biotechnology medicines.

678,AMGN,Amgen quarterly profit tops expectations despite sales decline,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) reported higher-than-expected third quarter profit on Wednesday as lower costs and improved operating margins helped offset sales declines in some of its most important products. The world’s largest biotechnology company also raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast, but its shares fell in  late trading as weaker-than-expected sales of a new drug and declines in sales of key blockbuster products may have spooked investors.   Amgen boosted its earnings outlook to $12.50 to $12.70 per share from $12.15 to $12.65 despite taking a financial hit to Puerto Rico operations from Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island last month. Analysts on average were looking for 2017 earnings of $12.58 per share, according to Thomson Reuters data. The low end of Amgen’s 2017 revenue forecast range was slightly raised to $22.7 billion with the top end still at $23 billion. Amgen shares, up 21 percent this year, fell 1.5 percent to $174.75 “Repatha, which is a key new launch drug for Amgen, is disappointing,” said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt about the expensive cholesterol drug struggling to reach patients being repeatedly denied by insurers. Repatha sales of $89 million were short of analyst estimates of $106 million. “Improving patient access to Repatha remains a top priority,” Chief Executive Robert Bradway said. In December, the company hopes U.S. regulators will allow Amgen to begin promoting data showing Repatha cuts the risk of heart attacks and strokes, seen as key to unlocking its sales potential.     Sales of Amgen’s two biggest products, Enbrel for rheumatoid arthritis and Neulasta, which prevents infections in cancer patients, each fell 6 percent - Enbrel to $1.36 billion due to increased competition and Neulasta to $1.12 billion as use of chemotherapies that increase infection risk declined. Prolia for osteoporosis was a bright spot with sales up 22 percent at $464 million. Amgen estimated the Puerto Rico-related cost to 2017 earnings would be 15 cents to 18 cents per share, with no expected disruption to product supply. It does not anticipate hurricane damage to significantly impact 2018 results. The company expects its Puerto Rico facilities to be fully operational by next week, while still using generators due to extensive damage to the island’s electrical grid. Revenue declined 1 percent to $5.77 billion, about in line with analysts’ estimates. But research and development spending, cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses were all lower.

692,AMGN,FDA approves heart protection claims for Amgen cholesterol drug,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc can now promote the ability of its potent but expensive cholesterol drug to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes, after U.S. health regulators approved adding those benefits to the medicine’s prescribing label, the company said on Friday. Amgen has long seen this development as critical to clearing onerous hurdles to patient access and unlocking the value of the drug, Repatha, which has had anemic sales since its August 2015 approval despite its billion-dollar potential. The injected biotech drug was approved on the basis of its ability to dramatically lower bad LDL cholesterol. But health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have made it extremely difficult for patients to get the medicine, even those whose dangerously high cholesterol met criteria for use in the original label approved by the Food and Drug Administration. As many as 75 percent of patients prescribed the medicine have been denied coverage despite numerous appeals, severely holding back sales. Repatha sales, while gradually improving, were just $89 million in the third quarter.  A study released in March of more than 27,500 patients showed that Repatha cut the risk of heart attacks by 27 percent and stroke by 21 percent compared with a placebo in high-risk patients already on high doses of cholesterol-lowering statins such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor. In the second year of the study, the benefits were more pronounced, with a combined heart attack and stroke risk reduction of 33 percent. But Amgen by law was unable to promote those benefits until the FDA approved adding those claims. The company has repeatedly said having the heart benefits added to the official label was necessary to get insurers to loosen their purse strings. “With this approval, it’s now more important than ever that appropriate patients obtain access to Repatha in order to avoid preventable heart attacks and strokes,” Tony Hooper, Amgen’s head of global commercial operations, said in a statement. “We will continue to work with payers to help ensure the patients who need Repatha the most are able to get this innovative medicine,” Hooper said.

697,AMGN,Amgen's Kyprolis improves overall survival in blood cancer patients,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said on Monday a final analysis of late-stage trial data showed that its Kyprolis combined with two other drugs helped blood cancer patients live longer. Kyprolis when used with two standard of care drugs, dexamethasone and Celgene Corp’s Revlimid, reduced the risk of death by 21 percent and extended survival by 7.9 months, compared with patients treated with the two drugs alone, the company said.  The study, ASPIRE, tested Kyprolis, chemically known as carfilzomib, in multiple myeloma patients whose cancer had relapsed following prior treatment or did not respond to treatment. “The data support the early use of carfilzomib as an effective therapy at first relapse, regardless of prior treatment with Velcade or transplant,” Keith Stewart, principal investigator on the study said, referring to Takeda Pharmaceutical Co’s cancer treatment. Amgen said it had filed with the U.S. FDA requesting to include the new overall survival data in the drug’s label. Kyprolis is approved for multiple myeloma that has progressed after treatment with other medicines. In the United States, nearly 95,000 people are living with, or in remission from, multiple myeloma, according to the National Cancer Institute.  About 30,330 Americans are diagnosed with multiple myeloma and more than 12,600 die from the disease each year.

701,AMGN,Amgen estimates its U.S. tax bill at over $6 billion as it repatriates cash,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) said it expects to incur tax expenses of $6 billion to $6.5 billion over time as it repatriates cash it has accumulated around the world because of the new U.S. tax law signed by President Donald Trump on Friday. Some of the expense is also due to the revaluation of its tax liabilities, the drugmaker said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Amgen did not say how much of its $38.9 billion in cash and other holdings it plans to move back to the United States.

711,AMGN,Amgen profit misses Street view; sees broad tax reform benefits,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) on Thursday reported a fourth-quarter profit well below Wall Street estimates, hurt by a steep decline in sales of blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel and higher-than-expected expenses, and its shares fell nearly 2 percent. But the world’s biggest biotechnology company provided a 2018 earnings forecast range with a midpoint that easily exceeded analysts’ estimates and announced a $10 billion share repurchase program and a lower effective tax rate due to U.S. tax reform. “The benefits of tax reform will be quite broad,” Chief Executive Robert Bradway said. Excluding items, Amgen earned $2.89 per share, 14 cents below analysts’ average expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For 2018, Amgen forecast adjusted earnings per share of $12.60 to $13.70 and revenue of $21.8 billion to $22.8 billion. Analysts were looking for $12.71 per share and $22.8 billion in revenue. Wider-than-usual forecast ranges were due in part to uncertainty over Sensipar, a secondary hyperparathyroidism drug that could lose patent protection as early as March, Chief Financial Officer David Meline said.  “We’re all waiting for them to do at least a modest-size deal. They need another product or two,” said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt. Amgen projected a 2018 adjusted tax rate of 14 percent to 15 percent. Other large drugmakers have announced rates of about 17 percent or 18 percent. AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) surprised investors  by announcing a 9 percent adjusted tax rate, rising to 13 percent over five years. Amgen plans capital investments of about $3.5 billion over the next five years, with 75 percent in the United States.

Revenue fell 3 percent to $5.8 billion, about in line with analysts’ expectations.

The company incurred $79 million in expenses in Puerto Rico for Hurricane Maria recovery and additional incremental expenses related to tax planning.

The drug, part of a class known as bispecific antibodies, is already approved for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) whose cancer has returned after treatment or did not respond to previous treatment, such as chemotherapy. The expanded approval is for patients with “minimal residual disease,” meaning the presence of cancer cells below a level that can be seen under a microscope. Such patients, who can now be identified with new molecular testing, still have an increased risk of relapse.  The FDA approval marks the first time molecular tests are being used to identify patients for early intervention in order to prevent cancer from reappearing, said Gregory Friberg, head of oncology global development at Amgen. In studies, four out of five patients with residual ALL showed no signs of the disease after a single cycle of Blincyto, he said. The drug can cause serious side effects including a potentially life-threatening inflammatory condition called cytokine release syndrome. An estimated 5,960 Americans will be diagnosed with ALL this year, and around 1,470 will die from the disease, according to the National Cancer Institute.

It will create 150 new manufacturing jobs, or half the 300 initially forecast. Amgen, headquartered in Thousand Oaks, California, said in January it would locate the new plant in the United States, due in part to a lower effective tax rate stemming from U.S. tax reform. The company will also receive corporate tax incentives linked to job creation from Rhode Island, according to Governor Gina Raimondo. “We continue to advance the state of technology in biologics manufacturing,” Esteban Santos, head of operations at Amgen, told Reuters in an interview. He said key elements of the new lower-cost technology include processes that yield a larger number of cells to produce biologic drugs, a smaller footprint that emits less carbon and uses less water and electricity.  The new plant will also use diposable plastic containers, instead of the steel vats of a traditional plant, to grow cells, which eliminates the need for complicated piping and wiring, requires less labor and makes it easier to change product lines.Construction time and operating costs for the next-generation technology are about half that of a traditional biotech manufacturing plant, according to Amgen.Biotech drugs like Amgen’s osteoporosis treatment Prolia are antibody proteins designed to interact with the body’s immune system to block the path of foreign, potentially damaging invaders. Drugs in this class, known as monoclonal antibodies, are produced from mammalian cells, often from hamsters, that are usually cultivated in large stainless steel vats. The new plant, which will employ about 150 people, is modeled after Amgen’s Singapore facility, which opened in 2014 and is also set up to allow for faster, more efficient production than traditional biologics plants with fixed bioreactors. The existing Rhode Island plant employs about 625, according to Amgen. Amgen’s largest manufacturing plant is in Puerto Rico. The company in January projected a 2018 adjusted tax rate of 14 percent to 15 percent and said it planned capital investments of about $3.5 billion over the next five years, with 75 percent in the United States.

732,AMGN,Rhode Island governor says Amgen will build another plant in state,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc will build a $165 million next-generation biopharmaceutical plant adjacent to its West Greenwich, Rhode Island manufacturing campus, the state governor’s office told Reuters on Tuesday.

734,AMGN,Amgen's Aimovig halved migraine days in 30 percent of trial patients,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A late-stage trial of Amgen Inc’s experimental drug Aimovig found that it reduced episodic migraines by at least half in 30 percent of patients who had failed up to four previous treatments, while 14 percent of placebo patients achieved that goal, the company said on Tuesday. The 12-week trial, presented this week at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, involved 246 patients suffering four to 14 migraine headaches a month who had tried two to four preventive treatments that either did not work for them or had intolerable side effects. “This is a trial in really difficult to treat patients,” professor Uwe Reuter, trial investigator and managing medical director at Charité Universitätsmedizin in Berlin, told Reuters in a telephone interview. He said previous studies excluded patients who had tried more than two other treatments. Reuter said the 17-point gap between the treatment and placebo groups was in line with previous Aimovig studies. Aimovig, currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is likely to be the first drug in a new class designed to target calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which plays a key role in migraine activation. A decision by the FDA is due by May 17. Amgen has partnered with Novartis AG to co-commercialize Aimovig in the United States, while Amgen has rights to the drug in Japan and Novartis has rights to commercialize in rest of world. The drug, a monoclonal antibody, was given monthly by injection at a dose of 140 mg for the trial. Similar drugs are under development at companies including Eli Lilly & Co and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, but Amgen emphasizes that Aimovig is the only one that targets the CGRP receptor pathway, rather than CGRP itself. Aimovig has the “potential to help fill treatment gaps in more difficult patient populations whose migraine has not been adequately managed with current therapies,” Sean Harper, executive vice president of research and development at Amgen, said in a statement.  Amgen said Aimovig trial patients also had statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in secondary trial goals including fewer monthly migraine days and better physical function. Researchers said no Aimovig patients stopped treatment due to side effects, while around 1 percent of placebo patients discontinued because of side effects. Analytics firm GlobalData has forecast that CGRP antibodies will generate combined sales of $4 billion by 2026.

736,AMGN,Amgen posts higher first-quarter profit as sales rise 3 percent,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) on Tuesday reported a higher first-quarter profit, driven by lower taxes and a 3 percent increase in product sales as growth for newer drugs like cholesterol medication Repatha offset weakness in older products. Shares of Amgen, which fell nearly 2 percent in earlier trading, were down another 1 percent at $170.01 after hours. Repatha sales, which more than doubled to $123 million, were higher than Wall Street expected, but the product “still has a long way to go to restore confidence that it has multi-billion-dollar sales potential,” JP Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov said in a research report. Amgen said it expects to continue volume-driven growth as it launches new products including migraine drug Aimovig, which is likely to get U.S. regulatory approval next month. The nation’s largest manager of prescription benefits, Express Scripts, told Reuters it is pressing Amgen and rival migraine drugmakers to reconsider the usual strategy of high list prices and hefty rebates. [L1N1S11CE] Amgen believes Aimovig has advantages over other migraine drugs and expects a “bolus” of patients once it is approved, Anthony Hooper, the company’s head of commercial operations, said on a conference call with investors. The biotech company slightly raised the lower end of its full-year financial outlook, and said its adjusted tax rate would be 13.5 percent to 14.5 percent, or half a point less than previously expected. Amgen posted first-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.47 per share, up from $3.15 a share a year earlier, helped by lower taxes and fewer outstanding shares. Analysts on average expected $3.23 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. First-quarter revenue rose 2 percent to $5.55 billion, with sales up 3 percent to $5.34 billion.  Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said the results marked “a good quarter and a good start to the year” for Amgen, while noting that expectations for large-cap biotechnology companies were low after weak performance so far this year as investors see a lack of meaningful catalysts to boost shares. Amgen’s sales of anti-inflammatory drug Enbrel, faced with more competition in the rheumatology and dermatology sectors, fell 6 percent to $1.05 billion, below Wall Street estimates of $1.09 billion.  For the full year, Amgen said it now expected adjusted EPS of $12.80 to $13.70, compared with $12.60 to $13.70 previously. It raised the lower end of 2018 revenue guidance to $21.9 billion from $21.8 billion and left the upper end unchanged at $22.8 billion.

739,AMGN,"Express Scripts targets Amgen, Lilly migraine drugs in pricing shift","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The largest U.S. manager of prescription benefits is telling drugmakers that the current pricing model is broken, and taking aim at Amgen Inc, Eli Lilly and Co and other makers of new migraine medicines to try and fix it. Express Scripts told Reuters it is pressing them to forego the usual strategy of setting a high U.S. list price, then lowering the cost for health plans through hefty rebates. It is also seeking a refund if the drugs don’t work within a defined timeframe.The shift could help Express Scripts and other pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) bring prices down, and deflect growing criticism of their role as “middlemen” in the drug supply chain.  The Trump administration and members of Congress have demanded that PBMs pass on more of the rebates they receive to consumers outraged over rising costs at the pharmacy counter. Many Americans now have health plans with higher deductibles or co-payments, making them responsible for more of their medical costs. Express Scripts is advising drugmakers to take that shift into account as they launch a new class of migraine drugs. “If your expectation is that you are not going to actually get that high list price, then don’t do that to patients who have high co-pays,” Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview, describing his message to Amgen and its rivals. “Let’s be more balanced. Let’s get back to where gross-to-net is not so different.”Amgen’s Aimovig is expected to be approved next month, followed by similar drugs from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Lilly that the companies say could benefit up to 4 million people in the United States.  Lilly has been pushing PBMs “for years” to create contracts that take drug performance into account, Chief Executive David Ricks said when analysts asked about the Reuters story on a conference call to discuss quarterly earnings. Ricks said he was happy that Express Scripts “is now changing their view and support this kind of construct. We’ll be happy to work with them on it.” The new injected therapies interfere with the function of a molecule involved in the processes that kick off a migraine, such as dilation of blood vessels in the brain. Wall Street analysts expect Amgen to announce a list price of up to $10,000 per year for Aimovig once it is approved, setting the tone for competitors. But Express Scripts and other PBMs restrict access to new drugs they deem too expensive, asking doctors to provide detailed evidence of why a specific patient may benefit, requiring the use of other drugs for a period of time or favoring cheaper rivals when available. Drugmakers could face similar issues with the new migraine treatments, Miller said: “Should they price these things too high they will probably not be able to achieve much market share.” Express Scripts is also pushing Amgen and its peers to refund two-thirds of the cost of a migraine drug if a patient stops treatment within 90 days because it didn’t work or caused major side effects.      Such guarantees are becoming more prevalent for older drugs with competing products on the market, including diabetes and hepatitis C therapies. It would be unusual to introduce them for the first drug in an entirely new class of therapy.Amgen, which will market Aimovig in partnership with Novartis, declined to comment on talks with Express Scripts. Research chief Sean Harper said in a recent interview that payers share blame for the current pricing model.  Their demands for ever-larger rebates has forced manufacturers to use higher list prices as a benchmark, he said.     “It is a ridiculous situation that we are in,” Harper said. “No one is paying the list price, but patients are exposed for a period of time” until they pay off their insurance deductible. Shares of Amgen, which will report quarterly results on Tuesday afternoon, fell 1 percent in midday trading. Lilly declined 0.5 percent.  Rising U.S. healthcare costs, the most expensive worldwide, are straining budgets for families, employers and government agencies. That has created new pressures within the industry to control costs.  To that end, Express Scripts has agreed to a buyout from health insurer Cigna Corp, while PBM rival CVS Health Corp plans to buy insurer Aetna Inc .     In interviews with Reuters, smaller PBM Abarca Health and insurer Highmark Health said they were adopting similar tactics to Express Scripts in negotiating coverage for the migraine drugs. CVS declined comment.  Teva said it was evaluating the pricing environment for its migraine drug.    The stakes are high for Amgen, which has struggled to grow revenue in recent years.  The biotech company’s last potential blockbuster, high-priced cholesterol treatment Repatha, has been stymied by PBMs who questioned its value compared to generic statins that cost $100 per year.     Repatha and rival Praluent, sold by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, launched in 2015 at list prices near $14,000 a year and were expected to be billion-dollar products. But Express Scripts and other payers have rejected most prescriptions written for the new medicines while awaiting proof that they lower the risk of death. As a result, Repatha sales totaled $319 million last year, while Praluent had sales of $195 million.     “If Amgen and Sanofi had it to do over again, I think they would have priced at half the list price and made a whole lot more money,” said Jason Borschow, chief executive officer at Miami-based Abarca.     Aimovig is far more effective at preventing migraines than current treatments, mainly low cost generic drugs. Recent studies have shown that Aimovig reduces episodic migraines by at least half in around 50 percent of patients.     The Food and Drug Administration is expected to decide on Aimovig by May 17. The agency’s decision on Teva’s treatment fremanezumab had been expected in June, but that may be delayed due to manufacturing issues. A ruling on Lilly’s galcanezumab is expected later in the year.

Repatha and rival Praluent, sold by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, launched in 2015 at list prices near $14,000 a year and were expected to be billion-dollar products. But Express Scripts and other payers have rejected most prescriptions written for the new medicines while awaiting proof that they lower the risk of death. As a result, Repatha sales totaled $319 million last year, while Praluent had sales of $195 million.     “If Amgen and Sanofi had it to do over again, I think they would have priced at half the list price and made a whole lot more money,” said Jason Borschow, chief executive officer at Miami-based Abarca.     Aimovig is far more effective at preventing migraines than current treatments, mainly low cost generic drugs. Recent studies have shown that Aimovig reduces episodic migraines by at least half in around 50 percent of patients.     The Food and Drug Administration is expected to decide on Aimovig by May 17. The agency’s decision on Teva’s treatment fremanezumab had been expected in June, but that may be delayed due to manufacturing issues. A ruling on Lilly’s galcanezumab is expected later in the year.

742,AMGN,RPT-FOCUS-Express Scripts targets new migraine drugs to change U.S. pricing dynamic,"(Repeats to additional customers with no changes to text) By Deena Beasley LOS ANGELES, April 24 (Reuters) - The largest U.S. manager of prescription benefits is telling drugmakers that the current pricing model is broken, and taking aim at Amgen Inc and other makers of new migraine medicines to try and fix it. Express Scripts told Reuters it is pressing them to forego the usual strategy of setting a high U.S. list price, then lowering the cost for health plans through hefty rebates. It is also seeking a refund if the drugs don’t work within a defined timeframe. The shift could help Express Scripts and other pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) bring prices down, and deflect growing criticism of their role as “middlemen” in the drug supply chain. The Trump administration and members of Congress have demanded that PBMs pass on more of the rebates they receive to consumers outraged over rising costs at the pharmacy counter. Many Americans now have health plans with higher deductibles or co-payments, making them responsible for more of their medical costs. Express Scripts is advising drugmakers to take that shift into account as they launch a new class of migraine drugs. “If your expectation is that you are not going to actually get that high list price, then don’t do that to patients who have high co-pays,” Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview, describing his message to Amgen and its rivals. “Let’s be more balanced. Let’s get back to where gross-to-net is not so different.” Amgen’s Aimovig is expected to be approved next month, followed by similar drugs from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Eli Lilly & Co that the companies say could benefit up to 4 million people in the United States. The injected therapies interfere with the function of a molecule involved in the processes that kick off a migraine, such as dilation of blood vessels in the brain. Wall Street analysts expect Amgen to announce a list price of up to $10,000 per year for Aimovig once it is approved, setting the tone for competitors. But Express Scripts and other PBMs restrict access to new drugs they deem too expensive, asking doctors to provide detailed evidence of why a specific patient may benefit, requiring the use of other drugs for a period of time or favoring cheaper rivals when available. Drugmakers could face similar issues with the new migraine treatments, Miller said: “Should they price these things too high they will probably not be able to achieve much market share.” Express Scripts is also pushing Amgen and its peers to refund two-thirds of the cost of a migraine drug if a patient stops treatment within 90 days because it didn’t work or caused major side effects. Such guarantees are becoming more prevalent for older drugs with competing products on the market, including diabetes and hepatitis C therapies. It would be unusual to introduce them for the first drug in an entirely new class of therapy. Amgen, which will market Aimovig in partnership with Novartis, declined to comment on talks with Express Scripts. Research chief Sean Harper said in a recent interview that payers share blame for the current pricing model. Their demands for ever-larger rebates has forced manufacturers to use higher list prices as a benchmark, he said. “It is a ridiculous situation that we are in,” Harper said. “No one is paying the list price, but patients are exposed for a period of time” until they pay off their insurance deductible. Rising U.S. healthcare costs, the most expensive worldwide, are straining budgets for families, employers and government agencies. That has created new pressures within the industry to control costs. To that end, Express Scripts has agreed to a buyout from health insurer Cigna Corp, while PBM rival CVS Health Corp plans to buy insurer Aetna Inc . In interviews with Reuters, smaller PBM Abarca Health and insurer Highmark Health said they were adopting similar tactics to Express Scripts in negotiating coverage for the migraine drugs. CVS declined comment. Teva said it was evaluating the pricing environment for its migraine drug. Officials at Lilly did not respond to a request for comment.

745,AMGN,UPDATE 3-Amgen expects strong demand for new migraine prevention drug,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) on Tuesday reported a higher first-quarter profit, driven by lower taxes and a 3 percent increase in product sales as growth for newer drugs like cholesterol medication Repatha offset weakness in older products. Shares of Amgen, which fell nearly 2 percent in earlier trading, were down another 1 percent at $170.01 after hours. Repatha sales, which more than doubled to $123 million, were higher than Wall Street expected, but the product “still has a long way to go to restore confidence that it has multi-billion-dollar sales potential,” JP Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov said in a research report. Amgen said it expects to continue volume-driven growth as it launches new products including migraine drug Aimovig, which is likely to get U.S. regulatory approval next month. The nation’s largest manager of prescription benefits, Express Scripts, told Reuters it is pressing Amgen and rival migraine drugmakers to reconsider the usual strategy of high list prices and hefty rebates. [L1N1S11CE] Amgen believes Aimovig has advantages over other migraine drugs and expects a “bolus” of patients once it is approved, Anthony Hooper, the company’s head of commercial operations, said on a conference call with investors. The biotech company slightly raised the lower end of its full-year financial outlook, and said its adjusted tax rate would be 13.5 percent to 14.5 percent, or half a point less than previously expected. Amgen posted first-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.47 per share, up from $3.15 a share a year earlier, helped by lower taxes and fewer outstanding shares. Analysts on average expected $3.23 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. First-quarter revenue rose 2 percent to $5.55 billion, with sales up 3 percent to $5.34 billion.  Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said the results marked “a good quarter and a good start to the year” for Amgen, while noting that expectations for large-cap biotechnology companies were low after weak performance so far this year as investors see a lack of meaningful catalysts to boost shares. Amgen’s sales of anti-inflammatory drug Enbrel, faced with more competition in the rheumatology and dermatology sectors, fell 6 percent to $1.05 billion, below Wall Street estimates of $1.09 billion.  For the full year, Amgen said it now expected adjusted EPS of $12.80 to $13.70, compared with $12.60 to $13.70 previously. It raised the lower end of 2018 revenue guidance to $21.9 billion from $21.8 billion and left the upper end unchanged at $22.8 billion.
