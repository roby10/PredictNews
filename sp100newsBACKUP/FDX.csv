1,FDX,Industrials could signal slower growth ahead,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturers are entering an period where growth is more muted, profit margins are harder to raise and earnings beats are less common.  The easy money has been made, many analysts and shareholders of U.S. industrial stocks say.  General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Jeff Immelt, whose company reports second-quarter earnings next week, acknowledges that the industrial conglomerate is operating in volatile times.  Demand is tremendous, the company’s chief executive says. “You see it getting better, yet at the same time, there’s more discontent,” Immelt said this week at a sprawling GE factory in South Carolina. “This recovery has been so different from previous recoveries.”  Analysts say industrials are in transition from a  “V-shaped” recovery after recession, when nearly everyone increased sales and profits, to an unpredictable period when some businesses thrive, others lag and picking winners is harder.  “Industrials as a group may be among the first to see their profit margins challenged,” said Keith Goddard, manager of the Capital Advisors Growth Fund, which owns GE, Johnson Controls (JCI.N) and FedEx (FDX.N), among other companies whose fortunes are tied to the business cycle.  “Margins are bumping up against all-time highs,” said Goddard, who favors healthcare stocks. “Don’t go to the industrial space looking for positive earnings surprises.”  Increasing commodity and labor costs will trim profits across corporate America, he said, hitting labor-intensive manufacturers. GE has more than 100,000 workers just in the United States.  Many investors play down the negative effects of the U.S. government debt-ceiling impasse and a cautious, debt-burdened U.S. consumer. Slow growth is not a double-dip recession, they say.  Although the U.S. recovery has stalled by some measures, other large economies are still hungry for heavy machinery, cooling equipment, tools and other industrial goods.  Companies keyed to Brazil, India and China, including 3M (MMM.N), Eaton Corp (ETN.N) and Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N), will again benefit from robust capital spending, much of it funded by governments.  One question earnings season may answer is whether Europe’s debt crisis will affect growth and alter profit expectations. Europe’s problems are overemphasized, said Oliver Pursche, co-manager of the GMG Defensive Beta Fund, which holds shares of Caterpillar (CAT.N), Deere (DE.N) and United Technologies (UTX.N).  Industrial shares have rallied into earnings season. For a graphic, click: r.reuters.com/wes62s “I’m not too worried about earnings this quarter,” Pursche said — but a potential global economic slowdown could damp prospects for corporate profits. “I’m much more concerned about cautionary statements from CFOs and CEOs about the rest of the year. It’s going to be a much more challenging environment.”  Caterpillar could sound a cautious note because of China’s efforts to rein in its economy, he said. China’s leaders have suggested they will again raise interest rates and bank reserve requirements to bring down inflation.  U.S. industrials are among the most globally diverse multinationals, but the U.S. market still accounts for as much as half of their revenue. Recent data offers fodder for both bulls and bears.  U.S. June industrial production data disappointed on Friday, and May was revised lower.  A monthly gauge of factory activity by the Institute of Supply Management rebounded last month from a May slump, easing fears of a broad slowdown.  But construction spending — a key market for companies ranging from Eaton to Ingersoll Rand (IR.N), United Technologies and Tyco TYC.N — has fallen for six straight months to its lowest in a decade.  And a quarterly Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI survey pointed to further growth, but at a slower rate. The poll of financial executives, a leading indicator of manufacturing activity, found a fourth straight decline in sentiment.  Companies whose fiscal years ended in June, including Parker Hannifin (PH.N) and Kennametal (KMT.N), will give initial glimpses into 2012 when they introduce 12-month earnings forecasts. Both are known for starting with conservative profit targets.  Other variables to watch this quarter are how much Japan’s March earthquake hurts companies such as 3M; electrical manufacturers’ ability to offset higher steel and copper costs with pricing; and the impact of a weak U.S. dollar.  Depressed housing and a delayed recovery in non-residential construction could hurt machinery makers and rental companies, as well as makers of air conditioners and components.  Other late-cycle markets, such as power generation equipment and aerospace, are also expected to grow over the next two years after declines in 2009 and 2010, so any sign of whether their rebound has begun will be an area of focus.  Electrical equipment and multi-industry companies are near the end of a beat-and-raise phase of their cycle, said Nomura analyst Shannon O’Callahan.  “You had the big V-shaped snapback against easy comparisons,” he said. “Growth has been abnormally high. We’re entering a maturing part of the cycle.”  Managers will point to moderating growth rates this quarter, with few sounding especially bullish. Corporate crystal balls are as cloudy as anyone else’s, O’Callahan said.  ‘WHITE-KNUCKLE’ BULLS  Enough investors see the glass as half-full that earnings expectations and price-to-earnings ratios have risen this year. Industrial shares .GSPIC are up 7 percent year to date, outperforming the broader market. A few, such as Tyco and SPX SPW.N, have jumped 25 percent or more.  At 16 times this year’s estimated earnings, industrials are more richly valued than the overall S&P 500, but are only slightly above their historical average, according to Goldman Sachs.  Goldman analysts, in a July 10 note, predicted industrial companies would sound a more “constructive” tone about the second half of the year than recent economic numbers suggest. They cited expanding late-cycle markets, the weak dollar, and share buybacks and acquisitions.  Most U.S. industrials will beat Wall Street forecasts by 1 percent or 2 percent, said analyst Brian Langenberg of Langenberg & Co, who calls himself a “white-knuckle” bull.  “I expect bigger beats out of companies levered to energy,” he said, citing Dover (DOV.N), Ametek (AME.N) and Emerson. “Ninety-some-dollar oil makes it worth punching holes in the ground.”  Langenberg said current expectations of double-digit profit growth over the next two years are reasonable.  “We’re not back at peak earnings yet,” he said.

4,FDX,UPDATE 2-Obama said ready to move on South Korea trade bill," * White House Chief of Staff Daley sees “no time to waste”   * Daley wants action by August congressional recess   * Republicans oppose worker retraining program  (Adds business official quotes, background)   By Doug Palmer   WASHINGTON, July 14 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will soon send a free trade pact with South Korea to Congress for approval despite Republican threats to vote against it because of a retraining program for workers displaced by trade, White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley said on Thursday.   “There is no time to waste fighting politics as usual,” Daley said in a speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the U.S.-Korea Business Council. “If we do not act before the August recess, American business will suffer.”   Obama faces a showdown with Republicans over his insistence that an extension of the nearly 50-year-old Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) retraining program be passed along with the Korea pact and two other pending free trade agreements with Colombia and Panama.   Republicans have objected to Obama’s plan to insert the TAA program into the implementing bill for the South Korea agreement, insisting that lawmakers be allowed to vote separately on the TAA and the trade pact.   The White House believes both could pass separately.   However, Daley said Republicans have yet to offer a “credible” plan that would prevent TAA opponents from blocking a vote on the program, which Democrats see as a vital safety net and many Republicans view as ineffective.   “We can no longer wait. If there’s no agreement on an alternative approach in the very near future, we will move forward to seek passage of the FTA (Free Trade Agreement) with TAA” included, Daley told the audience of U.S. and Korean business officials.   Daley said the White House expects the Korea agreement “to create or support 70,000 American jobs” through tariff cuts that will open the South Korean market to more U.S. exports.   Congress must act soon because a rival deal struck by the European Union with South Korea went into force on July 1, threatening U.S. market share in the longtime ally, he said.   Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has said he would vote against the Korean agreement if TAA is included in the implementing legislation for the deal.   But most business leaders recognize an extension of TAA has to be part of the mix, and don’t believe it is worth holding the agreement up over the issue.   “We can’t let differences over processes and procedures hold back these agreements any longer. American jobs and American standing in the world are on the line,” said U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue.   The deal was originally negotiated during the administration of former President George W. Bush and business groups have been waiting four years for it to become law.   “We’ve seen first hand what these free trade agreements do after implementation,” said Mike Ducker, chief operating officer of FedEx Express, a division of FedEx (FDX.N).   “Not only does it create new commercial opportunities for our customers and greater demand for our services, it allows us to continue growing our operations and our work force around the world,” Ducker told Reuters in an interview.   Critics, including the AFL-CIO labor federation and Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch, say trade deals endanger U.S. jobs by cutting U.S. tariffs and encouraging companies to move their operations overseas.   A study by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute says the Korean trade agreement could displace about 159,000 American jobs over seven years.   But Harrison Cook, vice president of international government affairs for Eli Lilly and Company (LLY.N), said the rival EU-South Korea agreement puts U.S. pharmaceutical companies at a disadvantage in a major market.   “All those tariff preferences are going to go to our Europeans competitors, not to us. That’s a significant consideration in this sector, where you do long-term contracting,” Cook told Reuters in an interview.

5,FDX,"USPS to study 3,600 post offices for closure"," * USPS to look at 3,600 offices in cost-cutting attempt   * Agency has not said how many will close -regulator   * 60 post offices closed since Jan. 1   By Emily Stephenson   WASHINGTON, July 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Postal Service is set to review thousands of post offices for possible closure as part of the agency’s ongoing struggle to cut costs.   The Postal Service is expected to release next week a list of about 3,600 post offices, stations and branches that will be considered for potential consolidation, said Ann Fisher, director of public affairs at the agency’s regulator, the Postal Regulatory Commission.   Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe also will discuss a new concept for replacing post offices, according to a Postal Service advisory.   A spokesman for the agency declined to comment on the review but said offices studied would not necessarily close.   “We only know right now how many they plan to review, but we have no idea how many of those they’ll ultimately close,” Fisher said.   The mail carrier has been struggling for years to counter falling mail volumes and competition from FedEx (FDX.N) and United Parcel Service (UPS.N).   The Postal Service, which receives no tax revenue, reported a $2.2 billion net loss in its second quarter and said it might be unable to pay its debts by September. [ID:nN10127971]   The agency in March said it planned to close about 2,000 post offices around the country by March 2012 and would cut 7,500 jobs. [ID:nN24148639]   The Postal Service has closed 60 post offices and placed 98 under suspension in 2011, Fisher said in an email.   The agency, which has struggled with growing employee costs in addition to eroding business, last month suspended some payments to retirement funds to save cash. [ID:nN1E75L0NR]   The Postal Service has repeatedly asked Congress to give it more flexibility to handle its finances.   Senator Susan Collins in February introduced legislation that would reduce the agency’s payments to pension funds and improve its contracting practices.   Representative Darrell Issa in June proposed cutting Saturday delivery and giving the agency more authority to close post offices and mail processing centers. His bill also would create an oversight board to help reduce costs.

The Postal Service, which is bleeding cash due to declining mail volumes and private-sector competition, said it is studying more than 3,600 sites for possible closure.   It hopes to enter contracts with about 2,500 community retailers across the United States, which will be called Village Post Offices, in the next year to sell stamps and provide flat-rate packaging services.   “When you think about it, Village Post Offices provide some really nice options for people in terms of access and convenience,” Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe said on Tuesday.   “It’s a very good opportunity for a lot of small businesses ... many of these general stores have been hanging on for dear life out there.”   The agency is preparing to review 3,653 facilities in 49 states — all but Delaware. Several Washington, D.C., locations made the list, including offices at the departments of state and agriculture and at the Pentagon.   If the Postal Service closed every site, which have seen low traffic and falling revenues, the agency could save up to $200 million annually, Donahoe said.   The Postal Service has frequently seen backlash from community leaders and Congress when it tried to close offices. This time, the agency has reached out to communities under review and local input will be expanded, said Dean Granholm, vice president for delivery and post office operations.   The review is expected to take four to six months, and the Postal Service has not determined exactly how many of its 32,000 offices, stations and branches to shutter, Granholm said.   Falling mail volumes as consumers increasingly use email and pay bills online, coupled with competition from United Parcel Service UPS.N and FedEx FDX.N, have hurt revenues.

UPS raised its 2011 guidance in April to between $4.15 and $4.40 per share, citing cost-containment and little customer resistance to a 4.9 percent net rate increase.   Barclays Capital analysts said in a research note they expect “volumes to remain muted, but believe pricing will drive impressive earnings gains.”   UPS announced this month a planned 6.9 percent average rate increase for certain shipments in its freight division and several other companies have mimicked the move. [nN1E7600A4]   “We expect international volume to be stronger, but expect very little domestic growth,” the Barclays analysts said. “In our view the market does not fully appreciate the potential earnings power UPS and FedEx can develop over time from improved pricing.”   In April, UPS forecast record 2011 results, despite what it called a “cloudier” economic outlook than at the year’s start.   UPS handles goods equal to 6 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product and 2 percent of global GDP in its trucks and aircraft, so its shipment trends give a tangible view of consumer demand.   Analysts are keen to see if international demand grew at a faster clip than domestic business during the quarter.   In the first quarter, UPS said it averaged 14.96 million daily deliveries. Of those, domestic deliveries edged slightly lower to about 12.7 million, while international shipments rose slightly to around 2.3 million.   Global trade is a key focus at UPS, as CEO Scott Davis is on the President’s Export Council that aims to drive U.S. business growth by doubling exports by 2015.   Among reasons UPS earnings could rise above consensus going forward, Jefferies & Co analysts said in a research note, is growing international export volumes two to three times global GDP. UPS shares closed at $74.05 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, up 2 percent year-to-date. The Dow Jones Transportation average .DJT is up 6 percent in that period.

12,FDX,"RPT-UPDATE 6-UPS view cautious citing debt talks, shares drop","  (Repeating July 26 story with no change to text)   * CEO-mood could quickly change with US debt ceiling talks   * Shares down 3.6 pct in midafternoon trading   * Q2 adjusted EPS $1.05 vs $1.04 Wall Street view   * Revenue $13.2 bln vs $13.14 bln Wall Street estimate  (Adds CEO quotes, analyst comment, updates shares)   By Lynn Adler   NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), the world’s largest package delivery company, gave a cautious economic outlook and cited stalled U.S. debt ceiling talks, pushing its shares down nearly 4 percent on Tuesday.   UPS, which posted a higher quarterly profit and affirmed its view for record 2011 earnings, voiced caution about peak season shipments because of economic uncertainty and the deadlocked negotiations over the U.S. debt.   “If Congress and the president resolve the debt ceiling issue satisfactorily in the next week, the mood of the country could change pretty quickly,” UPS Chief Executive Scott Davis told analysts on a conference call.   Without a resolution, or free-trade agreements, the company’s business customers are keeping inventory thin and expansion plans on hold, UPS said.   U.S. consumer sentiment edged up in July, but labor market worries kept consumers gloomy. [ID:nN1E76P0NI]   “While fuel prices have come down some and Japan appears to be recovering, high unemployment and weak consumer confidence continue,” Davis said. “The end of the second round of quantitative easing and the government debt issues only add to the uncertainty.”   As a result, he said second-half U.S. gross domestic product could be anywhere within a wide range of 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent and harder than usual to estimate. Second-quarter GDP being reported on Friday is seen having grown at a 1.8 percent rate, down from 1.9 percent in the first quarter.   Jeffrey Kauffman, a managing director at Sterne Agee, said the company’s record quarterly results show resilience in the face of a tenuous economy and political wranglings. UPS had pricing power in all of its business segments, he said.   “I didn’t interpret this as UPS saying ‘look out below,’ I interpreted it as UPS delivering a message to our politicians saying ‘don’t put political ambitions ahead of a recovery that needs to sustain.’”   UPS handles goods equal to 6 percent of the U.S. GDP and 2 percent of global GDP in its trucks and planes, so its shipment trends give a tangible view of consumer demand.   Its shares were down 3.6 percent at $71.36 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They have declined about 1.5 percent so far this year.   Smaller rival FedEx (FDX.N) in June said cost controls and higher shipping rates more than offset the slowing economic recovery and high fuel prices in its fourth quarter, and forecast an improved second-half economy. [ID:nN1E75L034]   Its shares were 1 percent lower at $90.95, down about 2.2 percent so far this year.   In the quarter, UPS’s international shipment volume escalated while domestic deliveries stayed flat because of the tepid U.S. economy.   Global trade is a key focus at UPS, as Davis is on the President’s Export Council that aims to drive U.S. business growth by doubling exports by 2015.   “International growth is really bearing fruit for them,” said Kevin Sterling, a BB&T analyst. “The thing that caught my eye is they continued to add flights in and out of China.   The company, which said export volume rose about 8 percent in the quarter, announced it launched a new flight between Europe and western China this week.   Davis said there will be “tremendous growth in western China over the next five years and we think we are in a position to well serve that market.”   In April, when UPS raised its 2011 guidance to the current record high between $4.15 and $4.40 per share, it noted its cost-containment efforts and little customer resistance to higher rates.   Atlanta-based UPS on Tuesday reported net earnings of $1.063 billion, or $1.07 per share, up from $845 million, or 84 cents a share a year ago.   Adjusted earnings were $1.05 per share, slightly beating the $1.04 per share that economists expected on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   UPS is ending the first half of the year with $2.3 billion in free cash flow, even after accelerated pension contributions and spending on four B-767 and two B-747-400 aircraft.   “We do think businesses and consumers are cautious given the chaos that seems to be, especially in Washington these days,” Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn said in an interview. “Nonetheless the company is in great shape and we feel very confident that we can manage through this environment while still growing the business and producing record earnings.”   The highest second-quarter earnings per share on record were driven by “the quality of revenue in the U.S. domestic, superior export volume growth in International and record supply chain & freight results,” he said.   Revenue rose to $13.2 billion from $12.2 billion a year ago, slightly edging above analyst forecasts of $13.14 billion.

The express delivery firm has been suffering on two fronts; its customers are less willing to pay for pricey air transport, while operational problems in its Brazilian unit have led to a loss of clients and a drag on earnings.	   “The drop in adjusted operating income was less than expected due to improved performance in Europe and the non-allocated items, which have to do with costs,” ING analyst Axel Funhoff said.	   TNT Express said non-allocated costs were lower as a result of overhead control and reduced project-related costs. These non-allocated costs are associated with operations outside its main networks.   	   Shares in TNT jumped as much as 7.5 percent and were trading at 7.39 euros, up 5 percent. They trade at 17.8 times forward price earnings according to Thomson Reuters Starmine, compared to 14.6 and 12.7 times for UPS and FedEx , often cited by investors as possible acquirers of TNT.	   While TNT Express Chief Executive Marie-Christine Lombard acknowledged that clients continued to shift to economy services at the expense of air transport, she said the company was taking measures to improve profitability across its network.	   “Europe’s performance was once again solid ... Demand from Asia to Europe has been volatile, and we are optimising our capacity accordingly,”  Lombard said in a statement.	   The International Air Transport Association said last week that there was little sign of an uptick in air freight volumes, even though world trade is currently growing at about 7 percent a year, because a rise in jet fuel prices makes other modes of transport more attractive.	   Last week UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, said it saw international shipment volumes jump in the latest quarter while domestic deliveries stayed flat because of the tepid U.S. economy. 	   Analysts expect Deutsche Post (DPWGn.DE), which runs rival express delivery firm DHL, to post a 7.8 percent rise in second-quarter underlying EBIT when it reports earnings on Tuesday. 	   In its first quarterly results since the company separated from Dutch mail group PostNL , TNT Express reported an 8.1 percent drop in adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to 79 million euros on revenues of 1.8 billion euros, up 0.9 percent year-on-year.	   Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast underlying EBIT of 70.5 million euros on revenues of 1.86 billion euros.	   The company said recovery in Brazil was on track and that while the short term would be challenging, it confirmed its second-half 2012 deadline to turn operations around. 	   The firm said it would issue an interim dividend of 0.04 euros per share, representing a payout of about 43 percent of normalised net income over the first half of 2011, in line with its dividend guidelines.	   TNT Express also said it had started to implement the 50 million euro cost savings it was targeting in 2012, with 5 million euro in restructuring charges in the second quarter and its head office restructuring planned for the third quarter.

As the economy improves, manufacturers of machine parts, cars and other goods ramp up production and pay Deutsche Post to transport parts and finished products.	   Europe’s biggest express delivery and mail company said on Tuesday it now expects full-year operating profit to reach the upper end of the outlook range of 2.2-2.4 billion euros ($3.2-3.5 billion), compared with consensus of 2.36 billion.	   The positive earnings trend would last into 2012 if the global economy continues to recover, Deutsche Post said.	   “The cyclical divisions showed an excellent performance in particular in view of slowing economic growth and what we saw from competitors,” WestLB analyst Raimon Kaufeld said.	   “Express showed roughly twice the margin reported by TNT (Express) as underlying development, forwarding matched the strong earnings growth reported by DSV , and the progress at supply chain is significantly better than that seen from almost any competitor.”	   FedEx Corp and Dutch TNT Express have both reported better than expected quarterly results as cost controls offset high fuel prices.  	   Deutsche Post’s supply chain business, which generates about a quarter of group revenue, agreed new contracts representing about 540 million euros in annual revenue in the first half and more than doubled its operating margin to 3.6 percent.	   Deutsche Post will run a high-security warehouse for Philips  , distribute drugs made by Bristol-Myers Squibb  in the United States and deliver cars to dealerships in Scotland for BMW , which earlier reported consensus-busting quarterly profits. 	   Deutsche Post’s second-quarter earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) more than doubled to 562 million euros, beating consensus of 542 million.	   Its shares gained 1 percent to 12.14 euros by 0815 GMT, while Germany’s blue-chip DAX index fell 0.5 percent.	   Aside from demand for supply chain services, results were also helped by the sale of unprofitable express businesses in Britain and France last year and by Deutsche Post’s ability to pass on higher fuel costs to customers.	   The company has raised prices for express delivery in Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa this year, and Rosen said it was able to fully pass on higher costs in the second quarter.	   Deutsche Post also sent more express shipments with a guaranteed delivery time — the most profitable category — driven by demand in Asia, where it generates about a fifth of group revenue.	   The company has benefited from growth in emerging markets as its customers grew there, and finance chief Larry Rosen said on Tuesday he saw good growth prospects for regions such as China, India and Latin America in the second half of this year.

16,FDX,FedEx Freight raises some shipment rates 6.75 pct," * Follows UPS and other transport rate increases   * Applies in U.S., Canada; cross-border with Canada, Mexico   NEW YORK, Aug 8 (Reuters) - FedEx Freight, a division of the No. 2 package delivery company FedEx Corp (FDX.N), is raising its rates on some shipments by 6.75 percent while keeping its fuel surcharge unchanged.   FedEx is the latest transport company, including United Parcel Service (UPS.N) and truckers such as Con-way Freight, a division of Con-way Inc CNW.N, to raise delivery fees.   Shippers have been able to pass through rising costs to customers with minimal pushback despite tough economic conditions.   FedEx’s rate increases apply to shipments within the contiguous United States and within Canada, and between the United States and Canada. The higher rate also applies to the U.S. portion of shipments between the United States and Mexico.   The higher rates are effective Sept. 6.

23,FDX,EBay shares slip on concern over U.S. Postal Service closures,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - EBay Inc (EBAY.O) shares dropped more than six percent on Friday on concern the company may be among the most exposed e-commerce players affected by the massive post office closures at the U.S. Postal Service.  The move by the USPS will impact e-commerce because when consumers buy a physical product online it has to be shipped, and often in the U.S. that’s carried out by the USPS.  The USPS is losing billions of dollars a year and Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe told Congress this week that it may default on a $5.5 billion payment due to a retiree health program at the end of September.  Donahoe wants to cut more than 100,000 workers, close thousands of post offices and end Saturday mail delivery.  “Any changes with any of the carriers that impact service are a big deal for e-commerce,” said Dan Weiss, vice president of operations at Shipwire, which stores and ships products for online merchants.  E-commerce has exploded and has taken market share from brick and mortar retailers. Part of that success has been fueled by efforts to make online shopping much like an in-store experience, while offering very cheap and fast delivery.  “Turmoil at the U.S. Postal Service will make it harder to do that,” Weiss told Reuters.  Big Internet retailers, like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), tend to use FedEx Corp (FDX.N) and United Parcel Service (UPS.N) rather than the U.S. Postal Service, according to Scot Wingo, chief executive of ChannelAdvisor, a software provider that helps merchants sell more online.  However, if thousands of post offices close, that will make it harder and more expensive for small and medium-sized online sellers, known as SMB sellers, to ship products, Wingo explained.  “That means eBay has the most exposure,” Wingo added. “That’s where those SMBs live and thrive mostly.”  About 30 percent of eBay sales come from SMB sellers, Wingo estimated.  All the smaller online sellers on eBay’s main marketplace will find it tougher to ship items. They will have to travel further to post offices, or pay more to ship using FedEx or UPS.  EBay shares closed down 6.7 percent at $28.46 on Friday, while Amazon.com declined 2.7 percent to $211.39. The Nasdaq Composite index shed 2.4 percent.  “EBay has historically relied more on small and medium sized businesses, as well as individual proprietors, as a source of activity, listings and transaction revenue,” said Scott Kessler, an Internet analyst Standard & Poor’s Equity Research. “It would definitely be one of the companies adversely affected by some type of restructuring involving the U.S. Postal Service.”  Spokeswomen at eBay and Amazon didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment about the impact of U.S. Postal Service changes.

25,FDX,"UPS expects record profit, ""slow-growth economy""","LOUISVILLE, Kentucky (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) Chief Executive Scott Davis said the world’s largest package delivery company is on track for record results this year in the face of the economy’s “bumpy ride” and expectations for sluggish economic growth.  Analysts were concerned that package delivery companies such as UPS and rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) would fall short because of the economy and plummeting consumer sentiment. Even as the company repeated its expectations, concerns about near-term economic growth appear to be clouding the reaction of investors.  UPS shares closed at $66.18, essentially flat compared with the prior session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up about 1.6 percent, while FedEx was about 1.4 percent higher at $77.08  Since peaking in February, UPS shares have fallen 14 percent. FedEx shares have fallen 22 percent in that same time period.  “The last few months, we’ve seen a bumpy ride that may likely continue,” Davis said. “Despite this great uncertainty UPS still expects to set a new high for EPS this year.”  UPS repeated its forecast in July for record earnings per share of between $4.15 and $4.40, citing cost cuts and higher rates.  “The odds are higher than six to nine months ago, but I don’t expect a double-dip,” Davis told reporters at the close of the investor meeting. “I expect a slow-growth economy.”  Davis and other UPS executives spoke at the Atlanta-based company’s first investor meeting in more than three years.  The company’s outlook, in spite of an unsettled global economy, follows similarly bullish comments by diesel engine maker Cummins Inc (CMI.N) on Tuesday.  General Electric Co (GE.N) Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said earlier on Thursday he sees “good, decent economic growth everywhere,” including in the United States, and is not worried about the economy slipping back into recession.  Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn said UPS remains cautious.  “We do remain cautious on the U.S. economy, but our expectation is that we have another year, year and a half, of sub-par growth and then we’ll return” to pre-recession trend growth levels of 2.5 percent to 3 percent, Kuehn said.  Two expected UPS growth drivers are global trade that creates jobs and healthcare logistics, which the company is investing in heavily and which Davis said is in the “early innings of outsourcing.”  “America is fed up and I am hopeful, maybe naively, that we will start seeing some policy decisions” shortly, particularly on global trade policies, Davis said, adding that one UPS job is created for every 22 packages that cross international borders.  “Consumer confidence, consumer trust in Washington, can’t get much lower than it is right now,” Davis said.  UPS’s small-business customers will start hiring once there is some clarity, he added.  U.S. postal service downsizing and U.S. defense spending constraints that lead to greater outsourcing by the U.S.P.S. and the military are also growth opportunities, Davis said.  Kuehn said shippers continue to keep inventory light, suspicious of consumer demand heading into this peak season, but the slow and stable U.S. domestic business is in line with its forecasts.  UPS expects earnings per share to rise 10 percent to 15 percent and revenue to increase 6 percent to 8 percent annually from 2011 to 2016. Its capital spending will be 4 percent of revenue over the same period, focused more on growth than on maintenance.  The company also said on Thursday it is expanding capacity by 65 percent at its hub in Cologne, Germany.  On Wednesday, it announced a service that enables greater control over the timing of package delivery for residential consumers. Consumers will get alerts via text message and other means, as the company offers free and premium options to make missed deliveries a thing of the past.  Kuehn said UPS has been buying back shares at discounted prices and raised the full-year estimate by $700 million to $2.7 billion. Buybacks should reach about $8 billion between 2012 to 2014 and return on invested capital is expected to be at least 25 percent by 2014,  The investor meeting is being held at UPS’s Worldport, the base for its international air express hub, its airlines headquarters and its largest distribution facility.

27,FDX,UPDATE 2-Obama's Postal Service plan would cut Saturday mail," * Ends Saturday mail, restructures huge upcoming payment   * Some proposals criticized by key Republican   * Postmaster general thanks president, offers no opinion  (Updates with business impact, lawmaker, USPS reaction)   By Emily Stephenson   WASHINGTON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - The Obama administration’s plan to rescue the U.S. Postal Service would allow the agency to end Saturday mail delivery and sell non-postal products, according to documents released on Monday.   The plan, introduced alongside a deficit-reduction package, also would restructure a massive annual payment to prefund retiree health benefits and refund $6.9 billion the mail carrier says it overpaid into a federal retirement fund.   The White House says its plan would save the Postal Service more than $20 billion in the next few years.   “The administration recognizes the enormous value of the U.S. Postal Service to the nation’s commerce and communications, as well as the urgent need for reform to ensure its future viability,” the White House document said.   (View the document here: r.reuters.com/wed83s)   The Postal Service has watched its core business of delivering mail erode as consumers send email and pay bills online. The agency has said it needs to downsize drastically or it will be unable to deliver mail by the end of next summer.   The agency has said it needs to reduce payrolls by about 220,000 by 2015 and is studying thousands of post offices and about 300 processing facilities for possible closure. [ID:nS1E78E16D]   Analysts have said the move to five-day mail delivery could hurt e-commerce businesses that rely on the Postal Service to carry their products to consumers. [ID:nN1E7881QF]   Shares of eBay Inc (EBAY.O) fell more than 6 percent this month on concerns that proposed cuts could raise costs for the site’s small sellers.   The Postal Service contends that weekend mail traffic is too light to support Saturday delivery.   “The president’s proposal would help the Postal Service update its business model to reflect Americans’ changing communications habits,” said Senator Tom Carper, a Democrat.   Many lawmakers in Congress back five-day mail delivery, but little consensus has emerged on how to overhaul the agency. Republican Darrell Issa has refused to consider revamping the prepayment or returning retirement fund money, which the White House plan and several Democratic lawmakers’ bills would do.   Issa, chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight Committee, offered an amendment on Monday that he says brings the savings in his USPS bill to more than $10 billion per year through cuts and restructuring.   His bill would end Saturday mail and set up groups to close facilities and cut costs if the agency misses payments. The amendment doubles the amount the agency would have to save by closing processing facilities and phases out delivery to front-door mail slots.   Issa’s plan, which allows USPS to override contracts and cut the workforce, could spark arguments in Congress when a subcommittee takes up the bill on Wednesday.   Obama administration officials said their plan supports retirement incentives but not layoffs, which postal unions and many Democratic lawmakers fiercely oppose.   The Postal Service relies on revenue from stamps, packages and other services, not tax dollars, to fund its operations. The agency lost more than $3 billion last quarter.   The agency expects to default on the $5.5 billion retiree health payment due at the end of September unless Congress provides relief. Lawmakers have indicated they want to extend the due date for the payment.

28,FDX,Amendment seeks to save US Postal Service $10 bln," * Parts could be controversial in mark-up on Wednesday   * White House to release USPS strategy on Monday   * Plans include ending Saturday mail, front-door delivery   * Also seeks to charge Alaska for rural delivery   By Emily Stephenson   WASHINGTON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Republican lawmaker Darrell Issa plans to offer an amendment that boosts the annual savings in his bill to overhaul the U.S. Postal Service to more than $10 billion, his office said.   Issa, who is chairman of the powerful House of Representatives Oversight Committee, will announce the amendment on Monday, when the Obama administration is expected to unveil its own strategy for saving the mail carrier.   The Postal Service has watched its core business of delivering mail erode as consumers send email and pay bills online. The agency has said it needs to downsize drastically or it will be unable to deliver mail by the end of next summer.   A draft version of the Issa amendment viewed by Reuters doubles the amount the agency would have to save by closing mail processing facilities, phases out delivery to front-door mail slots, and reduces the postal workforce starting with retirement-eligible workers before laying off other employees.   This adds more than $4 billion in savings, but some provisions contradict USPS policies or could anger lawmakers. A subcommittee will debate and amend, or “mark up,” Issa’s bill on Wednesday.   “Finding greater savings will ultimately give Postal Service leaders greater flexibility to protect core services that are critical for long-term success,” Issa said.   Several bills in Congress take different overhaul approaches. Plans include ending Saturday delivery, allowing the Postal Service to tap into an estimated retirement fund surplus and raising its borrowing limit.   The White House is expected to offer its proposal alongside a deficit reduction package, and at least one House Democrat has said he is thinking about offering a new bill. [ID:nN1E78520T]   The Postal Service relies on revenue from stamps, packages and other services, not tax dollars, to fund its operations. The agency lost more than $3 billion last quarter.   Issa’s bill would end Saturday mail and set up groups to close facilities and cut costs if the agency misses payments to the federal government. He has refused to consider fixes many lawmakers support, such as returning the retirement fund surplus or restructuring a payment to pre-fund retiree health benefits.   “I’m not going to go along with a fictitious story about taxpayers owing the Postal Service money when the facts show that’s simply not the reality,” Issa said.   His amendment could spark new arguments in Congress.   A spokeswoman for the Postal Service said some of the proposals have been discussed before but were not possible under current law.   The boost in required savings from facility closings follows a new Postal Service plan to close processing sites. Some lawmakers supported the proposal, but many have fought planned closings in their districts or states in the past.   Issa’s plan to end mail delivery to front doors matches recommendations of the Postal Service inspector general, who reported potential savings by sticking to curbside mail boxes or “cluster” boxes — multiple receptacles in a common area.   But USPS management said the inspector general’s proposals were unrealistic.   (Read the inspector general's report here: here)   The amendment also would require Alaska to pay for costs incurred delivering to residents in remote parts of the state. The plan likely will see pushback from Alaska lawmakers, who already this year criticized the USPS for considering closing some post offices in rural Alaska.   A reimbursement requirement also could be seen to violate the Postal Service’s ‘universal service’ mandate, the USPS spokeswoman said.   A spokesman for Issa said the bill puts all the possible cuts on the table regardless of expected popularity.   Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe last week told reporters he would continue working with Congress to shape an overhaul.   “I’m glad everybody has a plan because they’re interested. If nobody had a plan I’d be sweating it out,” Donahoe said. “It’s key for all of us to work together to craft up long-term legislation that puts us on good financial footing.”  ",9192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-postalservice-amendment/amendment-seeks-to-save-us-postal-service-10-bln-idUSS1E78H06N20110919

Chief Executive Fred Smith said he did not expect economic conditions to improve much any time soon, although he did not expect the United States to slip back into recession.  “We expect sluggish economic growth will continue, largely due to a lack of confidence that U.S. and European policy makers will effectively address current economic challenges,” Smith said on a conference call to discuss quarterly results.  The sour mood of the consumer, which is compelling companies around the world to squeeze costs and hold down inventories, remains the biggest drag on the economic growth that FedEx needs to give its business a boost, company executives said on the call on Thursday.  With inventories low, FedEx expects to benefit if there is an uptick in demand in the run-up to the holiday shopping season and retailers needed fast delivery. Much is also riding on robust online orders. But for now, things remain subdued.  “Our customers’ hair is not on fire,” said FedEx Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf. “They’re just saying, you know, we’re going to be steady as she goes, so it just feels completely different than it did back in 2008.”  The sheer volume of goods moved by FedEx makes its shipment trends a bellwether for consumer demand and economic growth. The value of packages handled by FedEx’s trucks and planes every year is equivalent to about 4 percent of U.S. gross domestic product and 1.5 percent of global GDP.  FedEx shares closed down 8.2 percent at $66.58, their biggest one-day fall in about 2-1/2 years and well below their year-high of $98.66 in July.  “The stock price action is clearly telling me that the market doesn’t believe that FedEx can even do the low end of its guidance. They think it’s that bad,” said Kevin Sterling, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets.  Donald Porter, an analyst at Dalton, Greiner, Hartman, Maher & Co, said the stock was cheap, and that it would be a good buy if the economy was just going through a slow patch.  But if there’s a recession “I would say you wouldn’t want to own it,” said Porter, whose firm holds shares in rival United Parcel Service (UPS.N).  FedEx, which is also being hurt by a slowdown in international trade reported earnings of $1.46 per share, just beating the average analyst estimate of $1.45, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/. (For a graphic, see r.reuters.com/kys83s )  To help counter falling volumes in the Express division, its biggest, FedEx said it would raise shipping rates by a net 3.9 percent on average for U.S. domestic, U.S. export and U.S. import services from January 2.  The company so far has had little resistance to rate increases, the latest of which went into effect this month.  Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx reiterated its $4.2 billion capital expenditure plan for the year ending next May. The company is considering buying about 50 wide-body freighters from Boeing Co (BA.N) and Airbus EAD.PA to update its fleet to more fuel-efficient models.  At FedEx Express, which represents more than 60 percent of total revenue, domestic revenue per package rose 13 percent in the three months ended August 31, mainly due to higher fuel surcharges and increased weight per package. Average daily package volume dropped 3 percent.  Volume fell 4 percent in the division’s international unit, mainly due to a decline in traffic from Asia. Revenue per package grew 16 percent, helped by favorable exchange rates.  FedEx is the world’s biggest air cargo carrier, a fact that Fred Labatt, director of equity research at South Texas Money Management, said made it more vulnerable than UPS to weakness in international trade.  “The stock is going to be more sensitive than UPS, which has a lot more ground and less air,” he said. “On the other hand, the yields were better pretty much across the board in all the segments, which means they’re getting pricing and the company’s doing a really good job of managing their costs,” said Labatt, whose firm holds FedEx shares.  FedEx said fiscal first-quarter profit, which slightly beat forecasts, rose to $464 million, or $1.46 per share, from $380 million, or $1.20 per share, a year ago. Analysts, on average, had expected a profit of $1.45 per share.  The company cut its forecast for earnings for the year to May 2012 to $6.25 to $6.75 per share from its June estimate of between $6.35 and $6.85.  Revenue rose 11 percent to $10.52 billion from $9.46 billion a year earlier. That was above the average forecast of $10.32 billion.  With the stock down about 30 percent this year, FedEx said it planned to buy back 5.7 million shares under its existing repurchase authorization.  The Dow Jones Transportation average .DJT has dropped about 19 percent this year while UPS shares have fallen about 14 percent.  UPS, the world’s biggest package delivery company, last week affirmed its call for record earnings in 2011, downplaying the likelihood of a double-dip recession.

40,FDX,UPDATE-Wall St Week Ahead:Earnings calls wake up to Wall St pain,"  (Updates with U.S. stock indexes' losses for the week)  * Analysts cut Q3 earnings growth to 13.7 pct from 17 pct  * Forecasts start to pull back for Q4 and 2012  * Financials seen most vulnerable; tech targets rise  By Claire Sibonney  NEW YORK, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Earnings forecasts for U.S. companies are starting to feel the pain on Wall Street and in the broader economy as the odds of another recession rise.  Intense fear that global debt issues and stagnant growth cannot be resolved has pummeled market confidence in the past couple of months.  Earnings have been one of the market's few positives, coming in strong despite economic woes.  But analysts now are toning down double-digit growth targets for the rest of this year and next on the heels of a record second quarter.  A distressing signal came from FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the world's No. 2 package delivery company, which many on Wall Street look to as an economic bellwether. FedEx lowered its full-year profit outlook this week, citing high fuel costs and a struggling global economy. [ID:nS1E78L03W]  Since July 1, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX has tumbled 15 percent. Forecasts for third-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 companies have slipped to 13.7 percent growth from 17 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. But many strategists say those estimates are still too high.  For next year, S&P 500 earnings-per-share estimates are eyeing $112, which would be a record.  ""If that number is anywhere near real, order the champagne now,"" said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P.  Over the last few weeks, analysts have cut earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies across all sectors except technology. Financials are among the hardest hit.  Negative guidance from companies is also on the rise, outweighing positive guidance by a ratio of more than 2 to 1.  Estimates for the fourth quarter and 2012 are down slightly to around 15.4 percent and 13.5 percent, respectively, and could pull back further as analysts react to more guidance, as well as to critical economic data, including housing and jobs numbers, and a worsening debt crisis in the euro zone.  Profit growth could still be relatively strong for the season that kicks off in early October, and that could lift stocks, which sold off nearly every day this week on panic reminiscent of the financial meltdown in 2008.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI ended the week down 6.4 percent, its largest weekkly percentage loss since October 2008, while the S&P 500 slid 6.6 percent. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC tumbled 5.3 percent for the week.  ""The way things are going, we're going to be in a recession by the end of the fourth quarter,"" said Barton Biggs, managing partner of New York-based Traxis Partners, in an interview with Reuters Insider.  The mystery lies beyond the third quarter into next year. Strategists speculate that estimates may be inflated by 5 percent to 15 percent as the market questions how far the cost slashing since the last recession can shield the bottom line.  FINANCIALS: THE ACHILLES' HEEL  Financials, worth more than 13 percent of the S&P 500 and the second-most influential group behind technology stocks, have been subjected to drastic cuts in earnings estimates.  ""That's obviously the Achilles' heel of the market,"" said Robbert Van Batenburg, head of equity research at Louis Capital in New York. ""Investment banking is probably going to be very moribund, bank lending is still not existing, and there are no gains to be booked at all.""  Banks are also suffering from worries about possible write-downs of euro-zone debt and less profitable lending due to the U.S. Federal Reserve's new measures to lower longer-term interest rates.  Financial institutions' shares have been dragged lower in recent days on renewed fears of exposure to European debt. Credit-default swaps, a measure of the cost of insurance against default on long-term debt, have been climbing.  ""The wild card here is really the banks. That's really where the earnings for the S&P have been kind of jerked around in the last couple years,"" said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., in San Francisco.  Insurers are also very susceptible to a lower-rate environment, while energy and consumer discretionary sectors are vulnerable to see-sawing commodity prices and damaged confidence.  For the country's biggest insurers, the Fed's ""Operation Twist,"" designed to stimulate credit for consumers and businesses, could threaten earnings for years to come. The problem is returns on insurers' investment portfolios can't keep pace with the obligations they have accumulated from torrid sales of annuities and life policies. [ID:nS1E78L0OE]  TECHS BUCK TREND  Tech, meanwhile, has been the sector where forecasts are rising behind powerhouses such as Apple, (AAPL.O), whose stock hit an all-time high this week.  The forecast for technology earnings for the full-year 2011 is 16.6 percent growth, compared with 2010, according to Thomson Reuters data released on Friday. In July, the forecast called for growth of 13.7 percent.  Yet even in this healthy sector, a cautionary tale came this week from chipmaker Xilinx (XLNX.O), a component of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index .SOX.

42,FDX,"Senator McCain offers postal bill, mirrors House","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator John McCain unveiled a bill on Friday to revamp the U.S. Postal Service, including an end to Saturday mail delivery, the latest of a series of legislative proposals to shore up the financially shaky mail service.  The proposal, which would also create advisory groups to reduce the number of post offices and cut costs, is based on Republican Representative Darrell Issa’s bill in the House of Representatives, a McCain spokesman said.  A Republican-controlled subcommittee advanced the bill Wednesday in a party-line vote.  Mail volumes have plummeted as Americans send email and pay bills online. The Postal Service says it must downsize or it will have to stop delivering mail by the end of next summer.  “Congress can no longer enact temporary fixes that avert financial crisis for only a brief period,” McCain, a Republican, said in a statement. “Congress, the Postal Service, labor unions and the mailing community must be willing to lay everything on the table and make hard choices.”  McCain’s bill leaves out some of Issa’s less popular ideas, such as phasing out delivery to front-door mail slots, requiring Alaska to pay the agency to deliver in rural areas, and boosting the USPS borrowing limit by $10 billion.  Democrats have balked at the idea of allowing the agency to break contracts with unions, and some lawmakers from both parties oppose ending Saturday mail delivery.  The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is hammering out a bill its backers say will earn bipartisan support. Moving to five-day mail has been contentious, and a Senate staffer said lawmakers from rural states were particularly concerned about the proposed change.  The Issa and McCain bills do not include proposals favored by lawmakers in both parties to return a $6.9 billion surplus in a Postal Service retirement fund and to restructure a massive annual payment for pre-fund retiree health benefits.  The Postal Service, which receives no taxpayer revenue to fund daily operations, says it will default on a $5.5 billion retiree health payment due on September 30.

Earnings have been one of the market’s few positives, coming in strong despite economic woes.

FedEx lowered its full-year profit outlook this week, citing high fuel costs and a struggling global economy.  Since July 1, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has tumbled 15 percent. Forecasts for third-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 companies have slipped to 13.7 percent growth from 17 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. But many strategists say those estimates are still too high.  For next year, S&P 500 earnings-per-share estimates are eyeing $112, which would be a record.  “If that number is anywhere near real, order the champagne now,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P.  Over the last few weeks, analysts have cut earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies across all sectors except technology. Financials are among the hardest hit.  Negative guidance from companies is also on the rise, outweighing positive guidance by a ratio of more than 2 to 1.

Profit growth could still be relatively strong for the season that kicks off in early October, and that could lift stocks, which sold off nearly every day this week on panic reminiscent of the financial meltdown in 2008.  The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week down 6.4 percent, its largest weekly percentage loss since October 2008, while the S&P 500 slid 6.6 percent. The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 5.3 percent for the week.  “The way things are going, we’re going to be in a recession by the end of the fourth quarter,” said Barton Biggs, managing partner of New York-based Traxis Partners, in an interview with Reuters Insider.  The mystery lies beyond the third quarter into next year. Strategists speculate that estimates may be inflated by 5 percent to 15 percent as the market questions how far the cost slashing since the last recession can shield the bottom line.  Financials, worth more than 13 percent of the S&P 500 and the second-most influential group behind technology stocks, have been subjected to drastic cuts in earnings estimates.  “That’s obviously the Achilles’ heel of the market,” said Robbert Van Batenburg, head of equity research at Louis Capital in New York. “Investment banking is probably going to be very moribund, bank lending is still not existing, and there are no gains to be booked at all.”  Banks are also suffering from worries about possible write-downs of euro-zone debt and less profitable lending due to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s new measures to lower longer-term interest rates.  Financial institutions’ shares have been dragged lower in recent days on renewed fears of exposure to European debt. Credit-default swaps, a measure of the cost of insurance against default on long-term debt, have been climbing.  “The wild card here is really the banks. That’s really where the earnings for the S&P have been kind of jerked around in the last couple years,” said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., in San Francisco.  Insurers are also very susceptible to a lower-rate environment, while energy and consumer discretionary sectors are vulnerable to see-sawing commodity prices and damaged confidence.  For the country’s biggest insurers, the Fed’s “Operation Twist,” designed to stimulate credit for consumers and businesses, could threaten earnings for years to come. The problem is returns on insurers’ investment portfolios can’t keep pace with the obligations they have accumulated from torrid sales of annuities and life policies.

New home sales for August are due on Monday, followed by the consumer confidence index on Tuesday.

48,FDX,Wall St Week Ahead: Earnings calls wake up to Wall Street pain,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Earnings forecasts for U.S. companies are starting to feel the pain on Wall Street and in the broader economy as the odds of another recession rise.  Intense fear that global debt issues and stagnant growth cannot be resolved has pummeled market confidence in the past couple of months.  Earnings have been one of the market’s few positives, coming in strong despite economic woes.  But analysts now are toning down double-digit growth targets for the rest of this year and next on the heels of a record second quarter.  A distressing signal came from FedEx Corp, the world’s No. 2 package delivery company, which many on Wall Street look to as an economic bellwether. FedEx lowered its full-year profit outlook last week, citing high fuel costs and a struggling global economy.  Since July 1, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has lost 15 percent. Forecasts for third-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 companies have slipped to 13.7 percent growth from 17 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. But many strategists say those estimates are still too high.  For next year, S&P 500 earnings-per-share estimates are eyeing $112, which would be a record.  “If that number is anywhere near real, order the champagne now,” said Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&P.  Over the last few weeks, analysts have cut earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies across all sectors except technology. Financials are among the hardest hit.  Negative guidance from companies is also on the rise, outweighing positive guidance by a ratio of more than 2-to-1.  Estimates for the fourth quarter and 2012 are down slightly to around 15.4 percent and 13.5 percent, respectively, and could pull back further as analysts react to more guidance, as well as to critical economic data, including housing and jobs numbers, and a worsening debt crisis in the euro zone.  Profit growth could still be relatively strong for the season that kicks off in early October, and that could lift stocks, which sold off nearly every day last week on panic reminiscent of the financial meltdown in 2008.  The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week down 6.4 percent, its largest weekly percentage loss since October 2008, while the S&P 500 fell 6.6 percent. The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 5.3 percent for the week.  “The way things are going, we’re going to be in a recession by the end of the fourth quarter,” Barton Biggs, managing partner of New York-based Traxis Partners, said in an interview with Reuters Insider.

50,FDX,U.S. to print stamps with images of living people," * Postal Service asking for names of people to be honored   * In past, people on stamps had to have been dead 5 years   * Move comes as USPS faces financial trouble   By Molly O’Toole   WASHINGTON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Americans will soon be stamping their mail with the faces of living figures, the United States Postal Service said on Monday.   The new rule for honoring individuals on stamps replaces a former policy requiring a person to be dead at least five years before being memorialized on postage, reduced from 10 years in 2007.   “The rule is changed as of today,” Stephen Kearney, USPS executive director of stamp services, told Reuters on Monday. “And we hope to have at least the first living subject on a stamp in 2012.”   Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe said in a statement: “This change will enable us to pay tribute to individuals for their achievements while they are still alive to enjoy the honor.”   Last year USPS sold 12.5 billion stamps, 700 million of which were commemorative, according to Kearney.   He said USPS thinks the move “will take stamps, which are already important and relevant to a lot of people ... and get more people involved, particularly young people.”   The Postal Service is inviting members of the public to submit their top five choices for living individuals they would like to see on a stamp via social media sites Facebook and Twitter — and, “as always,” according to the USPS website, by mail.   The new stamp policy comes as personal mail use declines and budgetary obstacles mount for the Postal Service.   Republican Senator John McCain unveiled a bill on Friday to revamp USPS, including an end to Saturday mail delivery.   The Postal Service, which receives no taxpayer revenue to fund daily operations, says it faces default on a $5.5 billion retiree health payment due on Sept. 30.   Kearney said the Postal Service makes over $200 million a year from stamp collecting.   “But it’s not the main reason to do it,” Kearney said. “(It’s) serious money, but a fairly small proportion of the financial situation we’re in.”  (Editing by Jerry Norton and Eric Beech)   ",9262011,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stamps/u-s-to-print-stamps-with-images-of-living-people-idUSS1E78P14820110926

52,FDX,CEOs say U.S. unlikely to slip back into recession,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (Reuters) - Corporate America’s chiefs do not expect the nation to slip back into recession, but say political gridlock in the United States and Europe could make for a long, slow recovery.  Top chief executives including General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Jeff Immelt and ExxonMobil Corp’s (XOM.N) Rex Tillerson said on Thursday that the U.S. economy could remain sluggish but will likely avoid an outright double-dip downturn.  “Recovery is underway, but it’s a long, slow recovery. Slower than we’d like,” the head of GE (GE.N) told a group of about 500 executives from mid-sized U.S. companies.  While conditions are making executives nervous, the situation does not seem nearly as dire as it did during the credit crunch during the last recession.  “This is a lot different than 2008,” said Immelt, chief executive of the largest U.S. conglomerate. “There’s liquidity; there’s pockets of growth.”  The head of FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the world’s second-largest package delivery company also offered a cautious view.  “We don’t see a contraction; we don’t see a recession,” said FedEx founder Smith. “It’s steady as you go, slow growth.”  Tillerson, who heads the world’s largest publicly traded oil company, sounded a similar note.  “I am not as optimistic as I was six months ago. It will continue, I am afraid, to be a sluggish (U.S.) economy, and globally the economy will not perform as well as we expected,” Tillerson told the Washington Ideas Forum.  “We will have positive growth (but) it is not going to be as positive as we hoped.  Data released on Thursday backed up their guarded confidence, showing a pick-up in consumer spending and modest improvement in employment — critical given that stubbornly high joblessness has been the main roadblock to the nation’s economic recovery.  New unemployment claims rose slightly to 401,000 last week, near a level that is associated with modest improvement in the jobs market.  And major U.S. retailers including Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N) and Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) reported stronger-than-expected sales in September, on average up 5.1 percent at stores open at least a year. A 4.6 percent gain had been expected.  Those reports and news that the European Central Bank was taking new measures to help the continent's banks weather the euro zone debt crisis boosted U.S. shares, with the broad Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX up 1.1 percent, for a third straight day of gains.  But even with that rise, the index is down about 8 percent for the year, reflecting deep unease among over the direction of the U.S. and European economies.  Immelt and Smith spoke at an event where GE Capital and Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business unveiled research on the “middle market” sector of U.S. business, companies with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue.  The study found that tier of business is an underappreciated jobs engine for the U.S. economy that accounts for about one-third of employment and continued to add workers through the recession, while big U.S. companies were shedding people.  Executives said political logjams in Washington and Brussels have made businesses more reluctant to invest and hire.  “The world has problems and classic institutions have not been able to solve these problems — that creates volatility,” Immelt said. “I’d like to think that a fully functioning integrated financial system in Europe could have stopped the Greece crisis quickly. That hasn’t taken place.”  Concerns that Greece could default on its debt have rattled European and U.S. banks over the past couple of weeks.  The logjams are not limited to Europe. Immelt cited this summer’s standoff in Washington over whether to raise the debt ceiling or allow the United States to slip into default.  “Congress just doing one bipartisan thing, however small, would be conducive to the market. It would be a positive to investors,” Immelt said.  Immelt, a lifelong Republican, currently serves as a top adviser to the Obama administration on jobs and the economy.  However, not all the blame lies with politicians, Smith said. He suggested that CEOs, who command considerable public attention in their own right, could do more to tamp down the partisan bickering that has flared in the United States.  In part, he said, CEOs can afford to be more candid in commenting on when they agree or disagree with policymakers than can officials who face election.  “If one person on the right said, ‘You know President Obama did a hell of a job on that bin Laden thing,’ the next time he ran for anything it would be on the TV and his opponent would say, ‘Obama supporter, I’m a better Republican,’” Smith said.  “Those of us in the business community who don’t need to run for anything probably need to be a bit more candid.”  ",10062011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-corporate/ceos-say-u-s-unlikely-to-slip-back-into-recession-idUSTRE7954D520111006

54,FDX,"DealTalk: Brad Jacobs: a U.S. transport ""serial acquirer""","(Reuters) - Bradley Jacobs sees a pioneering role in the U.S. transport business: to be an acquisition juggernaut and create a multi-billion dollar company in a $3 trillion global industry.  To narrow that down, the 55-year-old entrepreneur and investor wants to transform a $158 million company, XPO Logistics (XPO.A), into a $4-$5 billion business in just a few years, mostly through acquisitions.  Ambitious? Yes.  But industry experts think Jacobs’ “serial acquirer” approach will get him there — just as it did with United Rentals (URI.N) and United Waste Systems, companies he founded and swiftly built into market leaders.  “It’s going to be a little bit of a snowball effect,” said Ken Novotny, an industry banker at Morgan Keegan.  “He’s going to start with something that’s a nice core and then as he rolls it down the hill, it’s going to continue to pick up momentum both in quality and size.”  Jacobs already has the platform.  In June, he invested some $150 million in XPO Logistics and took over as chief executive of the third-party logistics provider.  XPO has about $72 million in cash on its balance sheet, and a $10 million credit line from its bankers.  Speaking to Reuters, Jacobs said deals he does in the near term would be similar in size to his XPO investment, and most likely involve buying private companies.  “The first step is to double the size of the company. We can do that with the financial means we have right now, without raising another dollar,” he said, adding banks are willing to raise XPO’s credit line.  Jacobs is targeting four areas in the transport business: truck brokerage, freight forwarding, expedited and intermodal. XPO is already present in the first three.  The transportation industry is highly fragmented, with hundreds of thousands of companies offering a variety of services — and more opportunity for consolidation.  The U.S. truck brokerage business, for example, is worth $50 billion a year and has more than 10,000 operators — but only 25 have revenue above $200 million.  The transport industry’s big guns are UPS (UPS.N) and FedEx (FDX.N), with annual revenues of $50 billion and $40 billion respectively. The vast majority of firms have just a few million dollars in revenue.  XPO’s large-cap rivals include CH Robinson Worldwide (CHRW.O) and Expeditors International of Washington (EXPD.O).  Bankers and analysts expect Jacobs to start with small acquisitions, and then pick up scale. Novotny said the sweet spot for Jacobs initially would be $30-$75 million.  Jacobs dropped out of university in the late-1970s — he was studying music and math — to start an oil brokerage business.  In 1989, he founded United Waste Systems and, largely through buying some 200 companies in 8 years, turned it into one of the top garbage collectors in the United States. He sold the business, now Waste Management (WM.N), for about $2.5 billion in 1997.  That year, he founded United Rentals and, within a year, transformed it into the world’s largest equipment rental firm in a year — sometimes averaging two acquisitions a week.  By 1999, Jacobs was worth an estimated $590 million, and missed making it on to the Fortune 400 list by a whisker.  Private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management offered $6.6 billion for United Rentals in 2007, but later withdrew the bid.

55,FDX,DEALTALK-Brad Jacobs: a U.S. transport 'serial acquirer'," * Jacobs aims to build $4-$5 bln business in a few years   * XPO Logistics to be his acquisition platform   * Jacobs to make small buys initially, then build scale    By A. Ananthalakshmi	   Oct 6 (Reuters) - Bradley Jacobs sees a pioneering role in the U.S. transport business: to be an acquisition juggernaut and create a multi-billion dollar company in a $3 trillion global industry.	   To narrow that down, the 55-year-old entrepreneur and investor wants to transform a $158 million company, XPO Logistics , into a $4-$5 billion business in just a few years, mostly through acquisitions.	   Ambitious? Yes. 	   But industry experts think Jacobs’ “serial acquirer” approach will get him there — just as it did with United Rentals and United Waste Systems, companies he founded and swiftly built into market leaders.	   “It’s going to be a little bit of a snowball effect,” said Ken Novotny, an industry banker at Morgan Keegan.	   “He’s going to start with something that’s a nice core and then as he rolls it down the hill, it’s going to continue to pick up momentum both in quality and size.”	   Jacobs already has the platform. 	   In June, he invested some $150 million in XPO Logistics and took over as chief executive of the third-party logistics provider.	   XPO has about $72 million in cash on its balance sheet, and a $10 million credit line from its bankers.	   Speaking to Reuters, Jacobs said deals he does in the near term would be similar in size to his XPO investment, and most likely involve buying private companies.	   “The first step is to double the size of the company. We can do that with the financial means we have right now, without raising another dollar,” he said, adding banks are willing to raise XPO’s credit line.	   Jacobs is targeting four areas in the transport business: truck brokerage, freight forwarding, expedited and intermodal. XPO is already present in the first three.	   The transportation industry is highly fragmented, with hundreds of thousands of companies offering a variety of services — and more opportunity for consolidation.	   The U.S. truck brokerage business, for example, is worth $50 billion a year and has more than 10,000 operators — but only 25 have revenue above $200 million.	   The transport industry’s big guns are UPS and FedEx  , with annual revenues of $50 billion and $40 billion respectively. The vast majority of firms have just a few million dollars in revenue.	   XPO’s large-cap rivals include CH Robinson Worldwide  and Expeditors International of Washington .	   Bankers and analysts expect Jacobs to start with small acquisitions, and then pick up scale. Novotny said the sweet spot for Jacobs initially would be $30-$75 million. 	   Jacobs dropped out of university in the late-1970s — he was studying music and math — to start an oil brokerage business.	   In 1989, he founded United Waste Systems and, largely through buying some 200 companies in 8 years, turned it into one of the top garbage collectors in the United States. He sold the business, now Waste Management , for about $2.5 billion in 1997.	   That year, he founded United Rentals and, within a year, transformed it into the world’s largest equipment rental firm in a year — sometimes averaging two acquisitions a week.	   By 1999, Jacobs was worth an estimated $590 million, and missed making it on to the Fortune 400 list by a whisker.	   Private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management offered $6.6 billion for United Rentals in 2007, but later withdrew the bid. 	   Michael Jesselson, who has worked with Jacobs for about 30 years and sits on XPO’s board, is confident Jacobs will expand the business dramatically in a short time. He reckons Jacobs can hit the $4-$5 billion target within 5 years, or 7 if the current market uncertainty drags on.

56,FDX,Midsized firms an underappreciated jobs engine: GE,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (Reuters) - American family lore holds that the middle child is often the least appreciated — not as cute as the baby and constantly struggling to catch up with the accomplishments of the firstborn.  There is a parallel in corporate America: the 200,000 companies that make up the “middle market,” bigger than the start-ups and small businesses that attract government help but not as hefty as the big businesses whose revenues have passed $1 billion and have Wall Street’s backing.  According to an analysis by General Electric Co and the Ohio State University Fisher College of Business, these companies, which together generate more than $9 trillion in annual revenue, are an underappreciated driver of employment: They account for one in three U.S. jobs and continued to add workers — 2.2 million of them — during the recession, when their larger rivals shed some 3.7 million employees.  Even so, with the memory of the 2008 credit crisis still fresh, these companies are also worried about their finances, GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt told reporters.  “They have access but they’re worried,” Immelt said. “This is a lot different than 2008, guys. There is liquidity, there are pockets of growth, and I think people have confidence that they might be able to find the right pockets of growth.”  MORE LABOR-INTENSIVE  Two factors contribute to their continued hiring, the report found. Even during the recession more mid-sized than large companies grew revenue and they are generally less able to automate processes than their larger peers.  “Middle market firms are, by nature, more employee-intensive than large firms,” the report found. “Their processes and systems are typically less mature than those of large corporations, so they tend to compensate by hiring more people.”  Mid-sized companies employ 80 percent more workers per dollar of revenue that they generate than their larger rivals, according to the study, based on a poll of 2,028 executives, including 1,447 from middle-market companies.  While GE, the largest U.S. conglomerate with $147.97 billion in forecast 2011 revenue, is far from a mid-sized company, those are a core market for its GE Capital finance arm, which loans money and leases equipment to them.  Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE, along with fellow large U.S. companies including FedEx Corp, on Thursday is convening several hundred executives and academics in Columbus, Ohio, for a summit intended to discuss the role that mid-sized companies play in the U.S. economy.  At a time when stubbornly high unemployment — which has hovered near 9 percent for more than two years — remains one of the biggest problem spots in a sluggish U.S. economy, more mid-sized than large companies are planning to add jobs.  A related GE Capital study released on Monday found that 68 percent of chief financial officers of middle-market companies, defined as those with more than $10 million and less than $1 billion in annual revenue, plan to hire more people over the next year. That is nearly double the 36 percent of chief executives of large U.S. companies who plan to add jobs over the next six months, according to a Business Roundtable survey of its members released last week.  Job creation has been an area of particular focus for GE’s Immelt since he signed on as a top adviser to the Obama administration on jobs and the economy early this year. He has repeatedly said that GE, which like many of its peers reduced its headcount by tens of thousands during the downturn, plans to hire some 15,000 people in the United States this year, a figure that includes both new positions and people to fill jobs that become vacant.

59,FDX,UPDATE 2-TNT Express warns on profits as demand sags," * Aims for 2011 EMEA underlying EBIT margin of 8-9 pct   * Targets H2 EBIT result in Asia in line with H1   * Plans value assessment for Brazilian operations in Q4   * Shares down 4.6 percent to record low   (Adds analyst comment, details, shares)	   By Greg Roumeliotis	   AMSTERDAM, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Dutch freight and delivery firm TNT Express issued a profit warning on Thursday as the global economic slowdown led more customers to snub air transport in favour of cheaper shipping.	   TNT Express, which listed in May after it split from Dutch mail group PostNL , cut its 2011 outlook and said it saw revenue pressure in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) in the third quarter as well as weaker demand in Asia.	   The news came in an unscheduled trading update, knocking the shares down 4.6 percent to 4.63 euros by 0954 GMT, the worst performers in Amsterdam’s bluechip index , which was up 1.4 percent. The stock first traded at 8.9 euros on May 26.	   Shares in PostNL, which still owns a 29.9 percent stake in TNT Express, gained 1.2 percent.	   Just last week TNT Express Chief Executive Marie-Christine Lombard, who also issued a profit warning in April, told a Dutch newspaper that economic woes had not hit the firm in Europe.  	   “Clearly a highly negative statement, things just seem to keep getting worse for this company,” Royal Bank of Scotland analysts wrote in a note.	   The company, which is relying on cost cuts to cushion the downturn, revised its 2011 outlook for the EMEA region to muted revenue growth with an underlying operating margin of 8 to 9 percent. In August it had guided for modest growth with an underlying operating margin of at least 9 percent, in line with last year.	   In Asia Pacific, weak demand weighed on the firm’s pricing and left spare aircraft capacity. It now expects the second-half operating result there to be in line with the first half, which saw a loss. In August, it had guided for a partial recovery.	   It also warned that other regions, excluding the Americas, would perform somewhat below the prior year.	   ASIA-EUROPE ROUTES	   TNT Express acquired Chinese freight firm Hoau in 2007 and has expanded in Asia by following its European customers. But the latest financial downturn has hit volumes and competitor FedEx last month also flagged lower traffic in Asia.  	   The International Air Transport Association said last month that Asia Pacific was the region that had seen the most dramatic downturn compared to 2010 and that, on a global scale, air freight had stagnated since the start of 2011. 	   But some carriers have fine-tuned capacity better than others. TNT Express’s main European rival Deutsche Post (DPWGn.DE) nudged up its 2011 outlook in August while UPS  has guided for a record profit this year.  	   Apart from the unwillingness of its clients to pay for pricey air transport, TNT Express has been grappling with operational issues in Brazil, where a botched integration of acquired businesses has led to a loss of clients and a drag on earnings.	   Lombard has set a second-half 2012 deadline to turn the Brazilian operations around. On Thursday the company said that a value assessment would take place in the fourth quarter of 2011.	   TNT Express reiterated that its planned cost savings for the year of about 50 million euros were under way and that it expected related charges and write-offs of 45-65 million euros. It is due to publish third-quarter earnings on Oct. 31.

60,FDX,Baird finds some PGA Tour comfort after again falling short,"SAN MARTIN, California (Reuters) - For only the second time in 348 career starts on the PGA Tour, Briny Baird felt he was poised to win a tournament before falling agonisingly short Sunday at the Frys.com Open. Seeking his maiden victory on the U.S. circuit, journeyman Baird was beaten by fellow American Bryce Molder on the sixth hole of a sudden-death playoff after missing a seven-foot birdie putt for the title four holes earlier. “I’m happy, and I’m very disappointed,” Baird told reporters after watching Molder sink a six-footer for birdie at the par-four 18th to claim his own breakthrough success on the PGA Tour. “I know how long I’ve played, and I lost my concentration one time today and it was one of the putts that I had to win the golf tournament. I looked ahead, and that was a mistake,” he said, referring to a missed birdie opportunity on the second extra hole. “I don’t know if I missed the putt because of that or what, but I did some really good things today. I was happy with the good things, I’m not happy with the outcome, but what are you going to do?” Baird, who had led by two shots going into the final round at CordeValle Golf Club, closed with a four-under-par 67 to finish level with Molder at 17-under 267. Four times previously Baird had been a runner-up on the PGA Tour but only once - at the 2001 John Deere Classic - did he feel capable of clinching the title. “The other times...I didn’t feel like I was out there to win the tournament,” Baird, 39, said. “I was ready for the tournament to kind of fall back to me. “Today I felt like I was out there to win the tournament. I hit some shots when I really needed to hit some shots, and for me that’s a big deal. There’s a hurdle that I overcame today.” Baird appeared to have the title in his grasp in regulation play after he chipped in to eagle the drivable par-four 17th but Molder joined him at 17 under with a birdie at the last. “Going into the day, it was like a lot of Sundays I’ve gone into,” Baird said. “I wasn’t feeling great, but I figured if I could just stick to my game plan and stick with a routine... “And I did that really, really good. I played good.” ",10102011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga-baird-1/baird-finds-some-pga-tour-comfort-after-again-falling-short-idUSTRE7990SU20111010
61,FDX,"Analysis: UPS, FedEx poised to gain from USPS pain","(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N), which have long been undercut by the U.S. Postal Service’s low prices for package delivery, could have much to gain as the agency faces a painful restructuring. Lawmakers are weighing a suite of options for the struggling Postal Service, including ending Saturday delivery, shuttering about 3,600 post offices and hundreds of processing facilities, and scrapping overnight delivery of letters and postcards. Analysts said market leader UPS, given its size, stands to win the lion’s share of the packages the Postal Service could lose, although any downsizing is widely seen bolstering the fortunes of FedEx as well. Research firm Sterne Agee estimates the Postal Service does about $20 billion of business in parcel-related markets. “I don’t think the whole $20 billion is up for grabs, but it doesn’t take but a small part of that to make a meaningful difference in terms of volume or profitability,” said Jeffrey Kauffman, managing director at Sterne Agee in New York. Pressure is mounting on the Postal Service to cut costs and restructure, as mail volumes decline with the growth of email and online bill paying. The agency is expected to announce next month a multi-billion dollar loss for the last fiscal year. Analysts are watching out for deeper cuts than already mentioned by Postal Service officials. “If the USPS were also to drop a mid-week delivery day — say Wednesdays — this might be a bit of a tipping point,” wrote Jefferies & Co equities analyst Peter Nesvold. “If the USPS were to start closing distribution centers and thus extend delivery times by another one to two days, market share gains by UPS would probably be more dramatic.” Others say the Postal Service is treading on thin ice if it cuts into the basic needs of consumers and could spur more people to switch to private shipping companies. “There is a certain segment that’s always going to want the cheapest delivery method, but there’s also another segment of the population that just wants to get it there in a certain number of days,” S&P; Capital IQ analyst Jim Corridore said. “It’s the kind of thing that could feed on itself. The Postal Service cuts delivery days so they get less volume and they get less revenues and then they may have to cut more ... it could be a self-fulfilling prophecy in some way and, eventually, they’d effectively end up privatizing the mail.” UPS is the No. 1 multi-day deferred parcel delivery player, followed by the Postal Service and then FedEx. Globally, UPS delivers 15.6 million total packages and documents each day, on average. FedEx handles about 8 million shipments daily. Ending Saturday delivery alone would have limited impact on the market, analysts said, as customers who use postal delivery tend to be less time-sensitive and more cost conscious. The Postal Service charges an average parcel rate of $3.26, roughly half that of private competitors. For that reason, David Vernon, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, is less convinced that UPS and FedEx have a major opportunity to cut into the Postal Service’s one-fifth share of the package delivery market in the United States. “Most likely that stuff that’s already in the postal service network is there because they can’t afford to go faster,” he said. “If you just lower the transit time, that doesn’t automatically make that shipment now worth spending double on upgrading to a UPS or FedEx ground shipment.” UPS, however, has pointed to an “upside opportunity” in pricing if the Postal Service’s current turmoil leads to an increase in the fees it charges. “When you’ve got a competitor that’s losing that much money something has to change,” UPS Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn told investors and analysts last month at a meeting in Louisville, Kentucky. Some postal package and first-class products are underpriced and if the Postal Service lifts prices, “we see that as raising the floor in the market,” he said. Investors will look for additional details when UPS reports quarterly results on October 25. FedEx spokesperson Maury Donahue said the company has long advocated changes at the Postal Service that would enable it to run more like a business. “We believe that a healthy Postal Service, the largest postal operator in the world, is important to America,” she said. Although most commonly viewed as competitors, the private delivery companies, most notably FedEx, works with the Postal Service on key pieces of business. FedEx was the largest postal service supplier last year at $1.37 billion, based on USPS payments received in fiscal 2010, and UPS was 12th on the list with $95 million, according to David Hendel, chairman of Husch Blackwell LLP’s postal service contracting practice group. The Postal Service makes final-mile deliveries for FedEx’s SmartPost and UPS’s SurePost offerings. But FedEx may not entirely be out in the cold. SmartPost, through which FedEx ships goods to the Postal Service for final delivery to residential customers, does not guarantee Saturday delivery, Dahlman Rose analysts led by Jason Seidl wrote. “If Saturday deliveries were eliminated, business levels at FedEx Home delivery could actually see a boost, as this division does guarantee Saturday delivery,” they added.

63,FDX,"FedEx sees record holiday volume, adding workers","(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N) expects a 12 percent jump in holiday shipments this year and will add about 20,000 workers to handle the record volume driven by online shopping. The surge is driven by a combination of gradual economic improvement and ever-increasing Internet sales, analysts said. “This is slightly better than we anticipated,” and suggests some restocking by retailers as well as more online shopping by consumers, said Dahlman Rose & Co. analyst Jason Seidl. “The economy right now is not as bad as some people had feared, though I wouldn’t say it’s going great guns, and this is also an indication that a lot of retailers kept inventories low and the consumer is not totally in the dumps,” he added. FedEx shares were up 3.5 percent on Monday after the company detailed its holiday expectations. Retailers and manufacturers have been keeping inventories lean because of low consumer confidence. Demand that develops closer to the holidays this year now will most likely be delivered by FedEx and United Parcel Service (UPS.N), which offer fast shipment options. FedEx said it will add about 20,000 seasonal workers to help handle the volume surge, up from 17,000 last year. “Peak season” shipping, in which goods are moved here from Asia in the fall for the holidays, was dulled this year because companies are not keeping excess goods on their shelves due to the sour mood of the consumer. U.S. gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the second quarter, underscoring the tepid pace of economic recovery. FedEx’s forecast “is a combination of maybe the economy is a little better than we thought, and that this really speaks to the growth of on-line shopping,” said BB&T; Capital Markets analyst Kevin Sterling. “Inventories are extremely lean, so any pulse of demand has got to come by airfreight, and that’s right in the wheelhouse for FedEx and UPS,” said Sterling, based in Richmond, Virginia. And e-commerce is showing no signs of abating, which plays into the hands of FedEx and UPS, the two largest package delivery companies, which move goods faster than ship or rail. “The buzzword this year is M-commerce, or mobile commerce,” in which convenience-seeking consumers order products via their mobile phones, further boosting online sales, Sterling added. FedEx said it delivers 61 percent of its packages in two days or less, for example. FedEx expects to deliver more than 260 million packages globally between Thanksgiving and Christmas, up 12 percent from a year earlier. Apparel, consumer electronics, luxury goods, books and other items from big Internet retailers will account for a large portion of holiday volume, the company said on Monday. FedEx expects to move more than 17 million packages on December 12, the projected busiest day in company history, more than double its average daily deliveries. That would top last year’s record 15.6 million shipments on December 13. As recently as 2005, the Memphis, Tennessee-based company’s peak shipping day was below 10 million packages. In its forecast, FedEx cited a National Retail Federation estimate that holiday sales in November and December will rise 2.8 percent from 2010 to $465.6 billion, surpassing the average increase of 2.6 percent over the last 10 years. It also noted various forecasts for rising Internet sales this year. One beneficiary will be the beleaguered U.S. Postal Service, which partners with FedEx for FedEx SmartPost deliveries. With SmartPost, FedEx delivers to post offices, which in turn make final delivery to residential customers. “As e-commerce continues to grow and demand increases with more customers shopping and conducting their business online, FedEx SmartPost is poised to handle the increase in shipments,” FedEx Chief Executive Frederick Smith said in a statement.

FedEx said it will add about 20,000 seasonal workers to help handle the volume surge, up from 17,000 last year. “Peak season” shipping, in which goods are moved here from Asia in the fall for the holidays, was dulled this year because companies are not keeping excess goods on their shelves due to the sour mood of the consumer. U.S. gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the second quarter, underscoring the tepid pace of economic recovery. FedEx’s forecast “is a combination of maybe the economy is a little better than we thought, and that this really speaks to the growth of on-line shopping,” said BB&T; Capital Markets analyst Kevin Sterling. “Inventories are extremely lean, so any pulse of demand has got to come by airfreight, and that’s right in the wheelhouse for FedEx and UPS,” said Sterling, based in Richmond, Virginia. And e-commerce is showing no signs of abating, which plays into the hands of FedEx and UPS, the two largest package delivery companies, which move goods faster than ship or rail. “The buzzword this year is M-commerce, or mobile commerce,” in which convenience-seeking consumers order products via their mobile phones, further boosting online sales, Sterling added. FedEx said it delivers 61 percent of its packages in two days or less, for example. FedEx expects to deliver more than 260 million packages globally between Thanksgiving and Christmas, up 12 percent from a year earlier. Apparel, consumer electronics, luxury goods, books and other items from big Internet retailers will account for a large portion of holiday volume, the company said on Monday. FedEx expects to move more than 17 million packages on Dec. 12, the projected busiest day in company history, more than double its average daily deliveries. That would top last year’s record 15.6 million shipments on Dec. 13. As recently as 2005, the Memphis, Tennessee-based company’s peak shipping day was below 10 million packages. In its forecast, FedEx cited a National Retail Federation estimate that holiday sales in November and December will rise 2.8 percent from 2010 to $465.6 billion, surpassing the average increase of 2.6 percent over the last 10 years. It also noted various forecasts for rising Internet sales this year. One beneficiary will be the beleaguered U.S. Postal Service, which partners with FedEx for FedEx SmartPost deliveries. With SmartPost, FedEx delivers to post offices, which in turn make final delivery to residential customers. “As e-commerce continues to grow and demand increases with more customers shopping and conducting their business online, FedEx SmartPost is poised to handle the increase in shipments,” FedEx Chief Executive Frederick Smith said in a statement. FedEx shares were up 3.5 percent in midday trading at $82.16. ",10242011,http://www.reuters.com/article/fedex/update-3-fedex-sees-record-holiday-volume-adding-workers-idUSN1E79N0C720111024
65,FDX,Higher profit seen from UPS; macro comment awaited,"* Analysts see Q3 EPS rising to $1.05 from 93 cents * Revenue expected to rise to $13.2 bln from $12.2 bln * Economic outlook key heading into peak delivery season By Lynn Adler Oct 25 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service is expected to deliver a stronger set of third-quarter results on Tuesday, driven by price increases, cost cuts and technology that improved efficiency in a weak global economy. And it will likely be its comments on the macro-economic outlook that will attract most attention as the world’s biggest package delivery company enters the peak delivery season. UPS and rival FedEx Corp are considered economic bellwethers because of the sheer volume of packages they handle: an average of about 15.6 million a day for UPS and 8 million for FedEx. The value of packages handled by UPS trucks and planes each year is equivalent to about 6 percent of U.S. gross domestic product and 2 percent of global GDP. “Their macro commentary is really going to be keyed upon by a lot of people,” said Jason Seidl, an analyst at Dahlman Rose & Co. At its first analyst meeting in more than three years in September, UPS said it still expected record results this year even in the face of a weak economic rebound. For the latest quarter, Atlanta-based UPS is expected to report earnings of $1.05 per share, up from 93 cents a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue is expected to rise to about $13.2 billion from $12.2 billion. UPS has forecast earnings per share of $4.15 to $4.40 this year on the back of cost cuts and higher shipping rates. “Even if you have flat or slightly declining numbers, you can still be profitable or increase your profitability if you’re able to increase price,” said Keith Schoonmaker, an analyst at Morningstar in Chicago, who expects UPS to report relatively flat domestic package deliveries for the quarter. The slow holiday shipping season for goods from Asia could actually be a boon for the express package deliveries that are UPS’s and FedEx’s bread and butter, analysts said. Retailers and other companies have kept inventories lean because of low consumer confidence. But if consumer demand rises with the slowly improving economy, and as online sales escalate, it would increase the need for on-time deliveries from these two companies that deliver far faster than ship or rail. FedEx on Monday forecast record holiday shipments, mainly due to online shopping, and said it planned to add 20,000 seasonal workers to handle the volume.. UPS shipped an average 12.6 million packages per day domestically and 2.3 million internationally in the second quarter. It has said it expects earnings per share to rise by 10 percent to 15 percent and revenue to increase 6 percent to 8 percent annually from 2011 to 2016. UPS shares rose 1.2 percent to $70.87 on Monday, and are down 2.4 percent so far this year.

66,FDX,How to play it: Riding the holiday shopping wave,"(Reuters) - Retailers have grappled with rising commodity costs, thinning margins and jittery consumer confidence all year. Now they’re set for the ultimate test: The make-or-break holiday shopping season, which accounts for 20-to-30 percent of all retail sales. Despite the still-sluggish economy, holiday retail sales are expected to rise 2 to 6 percent this year over the same time last year, according to analysts. In actual dollars, holiday spending is expected to reach $465 billion, according to the National Retail Federation. Shipping companies like UPS and FedEx say that boost will also mean increased business for them, with FedEx projecting a 12 percent increase in shipping volume during the season. Of course, not every retailer or business that could benefit from holiday sales will actually find profits in their stockings. How to find and play the holiday shopping season winners: Online retailers are again expected to take a large share of holiday shoppers spending money, with Amazon.com Inc leading the pack. “E-commerce in the United States is growing at about 14-to-15 percent, while brick and mortar sales are up about 7 percent,” said Rahul Sharma, managing director of investment management firm Neev Capital based in London and New Delhi. In the third quarter, total sales at Amazon grew 44 percent and analysts say the outlook going forward is rosy, largely because the company’s low-priced tablet, the Kindle Fire, is expected to be among the hottest selling items this year. “Amazon offers just about everything under the sun...there’s a reduced shipping cost,” said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at New York-based Banyan Partners LLC. “With the new Kindle line, people are going to be exploring buying a tablet that maybe might have been out of their budget in the past.” Tablet leader Apple Inc is also going to stay a winner as the new iPhone sells well along with the iPad, said Matt McCall, president of Penn Financial Group and editor of The ETF Bulletin. “The recent news surrounding the stock has brought the price back down to very attractive levels for investors,” he said, referring to a drop in stock prices after the company’s rare miss in its most recent quarterly earnings. In the third quarter, 74 percent of all U.S. Internet users conducted at least one purchase online, according to online data tracking service comScore Inc, buoying shipment volumes at courier companies such as FedEx Corp and rival United Parcel Service Inc. ComScore expects online sales in the months of November and December to be around $37 billion to $38 billion this year. And, of course, purchases made online must be shipped to their destination. “FedEx and UPS are well positioned to capitalize on that,” said Kevin Sterling, senior vice president of BB&T; Capital Markets in Richmond, Virginia. In October, FedEx said it expected a 12 percent jump in holiday shipments this year. It expects to handle a record volume of packages, driven by online shoppers, and will add about 20,000 workers to handle the rising demand. Rival UPS said this month it plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers to handle the extra holiday-related business it expects. Sterling predicts the two shippers could see package volume nearly double from typical volume during the peak of the selling season. “I have a price target of $90 on Fedex and $85 on UPS,” Sterling said. The two now trade at about $82 and $71 per share, respectively. Sterling views FedEx and UPS as two bellwethers of economic activity. He said that as their business picks up, and people “people start feeling better about the economy... we could see price appreciation.” Among traditional retailers, those catering to the well-heeled will do better than others, said New York-based Standard & Poor’s senior index analyst Howard Silverblatt, who picked out Tiffany & Co and upscale handbag maker Coach Inc as potential winners. The jeweler raised its full-year profit outlook in August, as consumers barely flinched at its price increases, while Coach expects sales gains during the holiday season as it ropes in new clients. “I like Tiffany, Ralph Lauren Corp, Nordstrom Inc and Williams-Sonoma Inc — companies that have mid- to high-end shoppers and some kind of unique products because that is what will give them pricing power,” said Neev Capital’s Rahul Sharma, adding that the companies are also benefiting from industry consolidation as weaker players have gone under. Penn Financial’s McCall said bootmaker UGG’s parent firm, Deckers Outdoor Corp, is another holiday play. He said a recent pullback in the share price after strong earnings offers investors a chance “to ride the sheepskin boot craze.” Companies that cater to shoppers seeking value might also be strong plays. Among them, McCall said the stock of off-price fashion retailer Ross Stores Inc is cheaper than its peers, making it a good buy in the run-up to the holidays. Powershares Dynamic Retail ETF, up 9.87 percent this year, holds a mix of retailers, with about 5.4 percent of assets in Coach and about 3 percent in Ross.

Police were alerted to a “domestic disturbance” at the facility at about 8 a.m. local time, according to the Bedford Park Police Department. While police were on the way to the scene, several 911 calls were received about shots being fired at the facility. Bedford Park police and other law enforcement agencies helped employees exit the building. Police then discovered that the shooter had killed himself. He had been armed with a handgun. Police used a remote camera to identify the gunman and look for other victims, according to a Cook County Sheriff’s Department representative. The man’s identity is being withheld until next of kin can be notified. No other injuries have been reported.

68,FDX,"Strong seasonal shopping lends UPS, FedEx holiday cheer","* Strong early holiday sales bode well for UPS, FedEx * Record e-commerce, m-commerce drive deliveries * Lean brick and mortar inventories may need replenishing By Lynn Adler Dec 1 (Reuters) - A combination of brisk online orders for items from tablet computers to Omaha Steaks and thinly stocked shelves at conventional stores is lending a fresh dose of holiday cheer for shippers United Parcel Service and FedEx. Blockbuster sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday largely exceeded analyst expectations, raising the likelihood that the two largest package delivery companies will notch record delivery volumes during the 2011 holiday season. Analysts will now keep a close eye on whether an expected late-season rush to grab new discounts in the final days before Christmas lifts UPS and FedEx above their expectations for the season. The holiday season has become increasingly important to shippers as shoppers shift more of their business to e-commerce and m-commerce — buying more goods via the Internet or mobile phone. This puts more small packages on trucks and planes operated by FedEx and UPS, both of which have shipping contracts with most of the biggest e-tailers. UPS has contracts with 21 of the top 25 e-tailers, based on rankings from Internet Retailer magazine. In addition, retailers - pressured by uncertain economic conditions - have generally kept leaner inventories, and this boosts their reliance on speedy shipping services to help them fill immediate upticks in demand. The two companies ship goods, such as Kindles and ski jackets, directly to consumers for a wide array of Internet or catalogue companies such as Amazon and Lands’ End. Traditional big box retailers, such as Best Buy , also are relying on UPS or FedEx to ship items like digital cameras and video games directly to customers. Cyber Monday online sales jumped 22 percent to a record $1.25 billion, closely watched Web tracking firm comScore Inc said. IBM Benchmark, an International Business Machines Corp unit, estimated a higher 33 percent increase.. UPS is seeing a gradual shift in doing business directly with individual consumers, rather than dealing with the businesses that sold most of the goods they purchased. About 35 percent of UPS’s domestic volume is “B to C”, or business to customer, rather than business-to-business shipments. Fifteen years ago, that share was just 10 percent. For the entire season, UPS expects bricks-and-mortar business to grow in the low single-digit percent area, compared with the double-digit growth forecast on the online side “UPS and FedEx both were planning on 5 to 10 percent parcel volume growth in the December peak period this year versus December peak last year,” said Benjamin Hartford, senior research associate at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. “That’s supported by the leanness of inventories, the continued penetration of e-commerce deliveries, and their models supporting both of those activities in the holiday shipping season.” FedEx and UPS both set records in the 2010 holiday season. UPS did not forecast volume for the full season, but expects “peak week” volume, for the seven days leading up to Christmas, to rise 6 percent and is hiring 10 percent more seasonal workers this year than last to handle the extra business. FedEx sees a 12 percent jump in holiday deliveries to record volume this year, driven by ever-growing online sales and a gradual economic improvement. It is hiring nearly 18 percent more seasonal workers this year. “We certainly are helping brick and mortar stores replenish their inventory at any given point,” said UPS spokesman Norman Black. “The more the online sector strengthens and grows and becomes an even more important part of retailing, the more important a factor it is to our business.” “Because of the recession, retailers learned they would have to do some discounting, find some way to entice people to buy, and they wanted to do that as absolutely long as they possibly could to Christmas,” said Black. UPS expects to deliver 25 million or more packages on at least five of the last 10 days before Christmas. Last year it had only one day of that magnitude. Consumer confidence is rising from depressed levels, but the early holiday sales rush in response to aggressive promotions could be followed by a lull until more deals are announced just before the holidays, economists and retail analysts agree. “This goes back to a game of chicken,” said  David Bassuk, head of AlixPartners global retail practice. “Shoppers are willing to wait until the last minute for deals. We will see a big pop right before Christmas that will be driven by promotions.”",12012011,http://www.reuters.com/article/holidayship-analysis/strong-seasonal-shopping-lends-ups-fedex-holiday-cheer-idUSN1E7AR0FG20111201
69,FDX,UPDATE 2-FedEx raising some shipping rates by 4.9 pct,"* Ground, Home Delivery, SmartPost up net avg 4.9 pct * Net increase matches 2011 * UPS previously announced similar rate increase By Lynn Adler Dec 2 (Reuters) - FedEx Corp said it will raise rates for FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery by a net average 4.9 percent next year, matching the 2011 increase. FedEx and its larger competitor United Parcel Service are among transportation companies that have been able to pass through higher rates to their customers, despite an uneven economic recovery, because of demand for their services. Hit by the recession, shippers have been keeping inventories lean and depending on just-in-time deliveries that companies like UPS and FedEx make. “The value we provide to customer supply chains, especially as speed and information can replace working capital and inventory, is even more important in today’s economic environment,” said spokeswoman Carla Boyd. UPS in November announced similar rate increases for small packages delivered by its Ground and Air services in 2012. FedEx’s new rates, starting Jan. 2, also apply to its SmartPost offering, in which FedEx ships packages to local post offices that, in turn, deliver the goods to residential customers. The No. 2 package delivery company in September said it would raise rates for its FedEx Express service by a net average of 3.9 percent, also starting Jan. 2 and matching the rate increase for 2011. In September, FedEx Freight began a 6.75 percent general rate increase, similar to the 6.9 percent rate rise the prior period.",12022011,http://www.reuters.com/article/fedex/update-2-fedex-raising-some-shipping-rates-by-4-9-pct-idUSN1E7B112R20111202

72,FDX,"FedEx profit beats Street, updating Boeing fleet","(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N) beat its quarterly profit forecasts and is updating its fleet with fuel-efficient Boeing aircraft while delaying delivery of other new planes to cut overall costs, driving its shares up nearly 8 percent. Cost curbs, fuel surcharges and other higher rates paid by shippers helped increase margins as volume declined in the Express and Freight segments, analysts and investors said. Online shopping boosted demand for FedEx’s home delivery services, increasing volume and raising expectations of ongoing growth in this smaller segment. FedEx’s fleet management for its Express segment, its biggest, was an encouraging sign for a company typically seen eager to incur expenses by adding aircraft. The company said on Thursday it is deferring delivery of 11 Boeing Co (BA.N) 777 freighter aircraft, adjusting for slowing volume out of Asia. FedEx also signed an agreement to buy 27 new 767-300F Boeing aircraft, replacing some that are more than 40 years old. The company said the 767s will provide similar capacity as the MD10s being retired, with about 30 percent more fuel efficiency and a minimum 20 percent reduction in unit operating costs. “Delaying of the triple-7s is favorable; in general Wall Street thinks that they spend too much money on planes,” said Kent Winegar, analyst at Terry McDaniel & Co in Austin, Texas, which holds both FedEx and United Parcel Service (UPS.N) shares. “When I go to conferences and talk to sell-side analysts, they’re always complaining that (Chief Executive) Fred Smith — he never saw a plane he wouldn’t buy,” he added. “They’re being a bit more cautious.” FedEx expects continued moderate economic growth, with trade flows staying volatile, executives told analysts on a conference call after the company reported results on Thursday. “FedEx Express took action during the quarter to adjust its network, particularly in Asia, as recent inventory destocking trends have impacted demand for our FedEx Express services,” FedEx Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf told analysts. “Balancing the network is a key driver in Express’ profitability and the volatility of trade flows is as high as it’s ever been and we think it’s going to be the new normal,” he said. “We’re going to have to be much more adept at matching our capacity quicker. I think we’re doing that.” The world’s No. 2 package delivery company reported fiscal second-quarter net profit of $497 million, or $1.57 per share, up from $283 million, or 89 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts had been expecting a profit of $1.52 a share. FedEx also affirmed its fiscal 2012 guidance for $6.25 to $6.75 per share, after trimming it in September on tepid global economic growth and high fuel costs. Revenue rose 10 percent to $10.59 billion. Analysts, on average, expected revenue would rise to $10.61 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Coming out of the downturn, we have learned that FedEx can push through price increases even on sluggish volumes,” said Matt Collins, Edward Jones analyst in St. Louis. “We think we’re only in the early or middle innings of FedEx’s yield improvement strategy, and that pricing should help returns in the future as long as the global economy does not fall into another recession.” FedEx delivered about 17 million packages on December 12, its busiest day in its 40-year history and twice the average daily shipments, driven by online holiday orders. “Our improved performance was largely a result of effective yield management programs and strong demand for FedEx Home Delivery and FedEx SmartPost services,” Smith said. “With the healthy growth in online shopping this holiday season, demand is increasing for these residential delivery services.” ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ For related graphic see link.reuters.com/fed65s ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The massive volume of goods moved by FedEx makes its shipping trends a bellwether of consumer demand and the economic climate. The value of packages that it handles in its trucks and planes each year is equivalent to about 4 percent of U.S. gross domestic product and 1.5 percent of global GDP. FedEx shares rose 8 percent to end at $83.47 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The company also has exercised options for two additional Boeing 777 freighters. The world’s No. 2 package delivery company said three of the 767s would be delivered in fiscal 2014 and six per year in fiscal 2015-2018. FedEx said the 767s will replace FedEx Express’ MD10 aircraft with a 30 percent increase in fuel efficiency and a 20 percent reduction in unit operating costs. FedEx has also been considering the competing Airbus EADS EAD.PA A330 for its upgrade, according to sources. The company also said it would delay delivery of 11 larger 777 freighters it has on order. Softening cargo traffic has caused some airlines to rethink their freighter purchases in recent months. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has warned of further declines after a significant cargo market deterioration in the third quarter. FedEx is the largest operator of 777 freighters, with 17 aircraft in operation and with orders and options for an additional 41 aircraft, Boeing said.

TNT said on Friday it is still in talks after turning down UPS’s offer of 9 euros per share, a 42 percent premium to TNT’s closing price of 6.343 euros. Some analysts said the UPS proposal sets the price floor and could flush out another bidder, such as U.S. rival FedEx Corp , looking for a stronger position in Europe. Those questions will come up when TNT’s executives announce fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday. TNT is a company under siege. It was spliced off from Dutch post firm PostNL last year in order to ringfence the more attractive express delivery operations from a traditional post business that is in decline in the age of electronic mail. TNT however faces tough price competition on its key routes, a recession in its core European market, and problems in Brazil, where it bought Expresso Mercurio in 2007 and its delivery partner Expresso Aracatuba in 2009, and where it has struggled to integrate those businesses. Its poor performance in terms of revenue, profit, and share price has led investors — including PostNL, which still owns 29.9 percent — to agitate for change. Activist shareholders want a new chief executive, a stronger supervisory board and a turnaround in performance, whether as part of a bigger group such as UPS or FedEx, or as an independent company. On Tuesday, TNT is expected to report fourth-quarter underlying operating profit of 61.2 million euros ($80.6 million), down 39 percent from a year ago and dragged lower by its loss-making operations in Asia-Pacific and in the Americas, according to an analysts’ poll commissioned by Reuters. The average forecast for fourth-quarter revenue is 1.85 billion euros, little changed from a year ago. TNT, which operates in over 200 countries with more than 30,000 trucks and vans and 50 aircraft, has already announced a 50 million euro cost-savings programme and promised to tackle excess capacity on its Asia-Europe routes. Earlier this month, the International Air Transport Association said freight traffic fell 0.8 percent year-on-year in December, and was down 0.6 percent for 2011 as a whole.",2202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/tntexpress/eyes-on-tnt-stock-beyond-results-after-ups-offer-idUSL5E8DI0EI20120220
76,FDX,TNT Express not expecting bid from FedEx-source,"* FedEx has not signaled intent to make a counterbid-source * FedEx sees strategic value in TNT, but price high-source * Analysts say FedEx could scoop up divested assets By Sophie Sassard and Soyoung Kim LONDON/NEW YORK, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Dutch delivery firm TNT Express is not expecting U.S. rival FedEx  to trump a 4.9 billion euros ($6.5 billion) takeover bid from United Parcel Services, a source close to TNT said on Thursday. TNT last week rejected a 9 euros per share cash offer from UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, but is still in talks with its U.S. suitor. TNT’s shares jumped to an all-time high of 10.24 euros this week partly on hopes that FedEx, which has flirted with the idea of buying TNT for years, might trigger a bidding war. “The last discussion we had with them (FedEx) didn’t give us the impression that they were ready to make a move”, the source said, adding he had sounded out FedEx’s intentions very recently. While FedEx sees strategic value in combining with TNT, it feels the price has become too expensive to do a deal at this point, another source close to the situation said. The sources asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak with the media. FedEx and TNT declined to comment. Some analysts said FedEx could be better off scooping up assets that competition regulators might require UPS to sell if it succeeds in winning over its Dutch target. Sources close to the talks between UPS and TNT said a combined firm would need to make significant asset sales in Europe - the Netherlands, Britain and Germany in particular - to win regulatory approval. “You could see some assets that are displaced or some market share opportunities that come from the deal as well that could benefit FedEx,” said Benjamin Hartford, senior research associate at Robert W. Baird. FedEx has the financial wherewithal to make a counter bid for TNT. But its lower valuation than UPS could make a deal more difficult to sell to its shareholders, a banker familiar with FedEx’s thinking said. Its smaller presence in Europe also means it may not be able to make as many cost savings. UPS shares trade at 9.8 times current-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), while FedEx trades at just above 6 times, Reuters Starmine data shows. With a market capitalisation of $28.5 billion, FedEx also has a weaker balance sheet than the $73 billion UPS. FedEx has a negligible 3 percent market share in European delivery, a third of what UPS claims, making it harder for FedEx to make savings from a deal. TNT is the market leader in Europe with an 18 percent share, followed by Deutsche Posts’ DHL at 15 percent. “It’s hard for FedEx. UPS has been watching this for a really long time, and they’re pretty well positioned to buy this,” said one sector banker who is not directly involved in the situation. “You could argue that FedEx gets involved only to make it more expensive for UPS, but I don’t think FedEx will make a proposal if they don’t have the intent to really buy that.” The source close to TNT thought the most likely scenario was that UPS would eventually sweeten its offer to win over TNT. Deutsche Bank analysts said FedEx could focus instead on making several smaller acquisitions in select markets or explore a joint venture with DHL, where FedEx would leverage DHL’s presence in Europe and DHL could leverage FedEx’s strength in the United States. FedEx has said in the past it plans to grow in Europe organically and with small “tuck-in” purchases. Its focus over the next 10 and 20 years has been and will continue to be developing in Asia, according to analysts. “We really think the company has been more focused on trying to find higher growth regions than Europe, which we would expect to grow at a pace no greater than what the U.S. would grow,” said Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker.",2232012,http://www.reuters.com/article/tnt-fedex/tnt-express-not-expecting-bid-from-fedex-source-idUSL5E8DN3P120120223
77,FDX,FedEx settles hiring probe for $3 million,"(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N) will pay back wages and interest to more than 21,000 people rejected for jobs in a $3 million settlement of a bias case brought against two of the company’s units by the U.S. Department of Labor. FedEx Ground Package System Inc and FedEx SmartPost Inc were the focus of a 7-year-long review by the Labor Department’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP). This was the largest single financial settlement it had negotiated since 2004, OFCCP said in a statement. Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx, the world’s No. 2 package delivery company, also agreed to reform hiring practices and make job offers to 1,703 of the affected workers as positions open. “This settlement is proof that we will aggressively protect workers, promote workplace diversity and enforce the laws governing federal contractors,” Labor Secretary Hilda Solis said in a statement. The biggest prior such settlement in 2004 was for $5.5 million with Wachovia Corp, in which OFCCP alleged that more than 2,000 female workers had been underpaid, a Labor Department spokeswoman said. OFCCP compliance officers found evidence that FedEx’s hiring processes and selection procedures violated a presidential order from 1965 by discriminating on the bases of sex, race and/or national origin against specific groups identified at 23 facilities in 15 states, the department said. Affected workers included men and women; African-American, Caucasian, Native American job seekers; and potential employees of Hispanic and Asian descent. The reviews also uncovered extensive violations of record-keeping requirements, the department said. “While we admitted no wrongdoing and believe the DOL’s position was not supported by the law, we agreed to pay $3 million to avoid what would have been certainly a prolonged and much more expensive resolution process,” a FedEx spokesman said. “We have and will continue to review and enhance our hiring practices to promote FedEx Ground’s commitment to diversity and equal employment opportunity.” The allegations, he said, were based on computer statistical analysis rather than on individual complaints or investigations. FedEx on Thursday reported a big jump in quarterly profit but downgraded its outlook for the rest of the year due to tepid global economic growth. Among other recent discrimination settlements with the Department of Labor, Tyson Fresh Meats Inc, a unit of Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N), agreed in September 2011 to pay $2.24 million to settle sex discrimination claims with more than 1,650 qualified female applicants denied jobs at four Midwest plants. Alcoa (AA.N) unit Alcoa Mill Products agreed in August 2011 to pay more than $540,000,and in June 2011, pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca (AZN.L) agreed to pay $250,000.

Newly released manufacturing indicators for China, Germany and France drove home the faltering pace of recovery. “They did a great job managing the business, but volumes just aren’t as strong as we’d like to see,” said Collins. FedEx on Thursday set a fiscal fourth-quarter profit target of $1.75 to $2.00 per share, compared with analysts’ average expectation of $1.98, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Memphis, Tennessee-based company’s shares fell 4 percent to $91.95 in late morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. “The fourth quarter is still very good, but what we’re seeing at the moment ... is we just don’t have as strong an economy as we would have hoped it would be a year ago,” Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf told analysts on a conference call. “The economic environment and the elasticity that we’re seeing on our premium services due to high fuel costs are dampening momentum a bit.” The company said more expensive fuel was prompting customers to choose to ship goods by truck rather than air to save money. FedEx said on Thursday that net earnings in the third quarter that ended February 29 rose to $521 million, or $1.65 per share, from $231 million, or 73 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, profit rose to $1.55 per share from 81 cents a year ago. On that basis, analysts had expected $1.35 per share. Revenue increased 9 percent to $10.56 billion from $9.66 billion a year ago. Analysts on average were expecting $10.6 billion, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “This is a very good year for them and quite frankly it isn’t even a year where they’re hitting on all cylinders. There’s a lot of upside potential for this company,” said Art Hatfield, managing director in equity research at Morgan Keegan in Memphis. “We’re looking at a company that’s probably pretty close to prior peak earnings, but they’re nowhere near operating at peak levels with regards to margins and other things.” FedEx shares are still up about 10.3 percent so far this year, compared with larger rival United Parcel Service Inc, which is up 9.5 percent and the broad Standard & Poor’s 500 index, which is up 10.5 percent. Both companies have been able to push through rate increases to customers this year and each reported record holiday shipping driven by escalating demand for on-line shopping. UPS on Monday reached a $6.85 billion deal to buy Dutch peer TNT Express, extending its lead over FedEx in Europe. FedEx Chief Executive Fred Smith declined to comment on the UPS and TNT tie-up but said his company’s approach in Europe would not change. “FedEx Express has a profitable multibillion-dollar business in Europe and it is growing strongly,” Smith told analysts. “We are very confident in our plans to continue expansion, primarily through organic growth.” FedEx is undergoing a fleet upgrade to improve fuel efficiency, having announced in December that it was buying new Boeing aircraft to replace some aging planes and delaying delivery of others to cut expenses.

84,FDX,Fedex in talks to buy France's TATEX,"(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N) said on Tuesday it is in talks to possibly buy French express company TATEX, less than two weeks after announcing plans to buy family-owned Polish shipping company Opek Sp. Z o.o., as it expands in Europe with small takeovers. FedEx, the world’s No. 2 package delivery company, has said it plans to grow organically and through small “tuck-in” purchases in Europe, where it expects a mild recession. No. 1 package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), on the other hand, is in the midst of its largest takeover in its nearly 105-year history with the purchase of Dutch peer TNT Express NV TNTE.AS for about $6.8 billion. TATEX has annual sales of about 150 million euro, or roughly $200 million, FedEx said. Opek’s domestic ground network has an estimated $70 million in annual revenue. Analysts endorsed FedEx’s strategy of growing in Europe with small purchases, saying it can stay competitive there even with UPS’s large tie-up with TNT. The company has also said it will focus on expanding in Asia, where economic growth is seen topping the pace in Europe. “I view FedEx’s strategy favorably,” said Benjamin Hartford, senior research associate at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. “Some investors look at UPS purchasing TNT as effectively locking FedEx out of Europe. I don’t think that’s the case.” “From a shareholder perspective as well, it makes more sense for them to deploy capital opportunistically through these small tuck-ins that through a large deal that might be viewed as defensive or unnecessarily expensive if they were to go after TNT,” Hartford added. The European parcel delivery business is fragmented enough for FedEx to target smaller companies and work toward consolidating that market, analysts agree. “I would say that certainly a third of the European parcel market in aggregate is comprised of these relatively small, local national or regional parcel providers,” said Hartford. That is a much larger share of smaller companies than in the United States or Asia, from which FedEx can build its European footprint, he added. TATEX, founded in 1976, is a business-to-business express transportation company for heavy shipments in France, with more than 1,000 employees and a central hub near Paris, FedEx said in a statement. The company carries more than 19 million parcels annually, specializing in high-tech, spare parts, automotive and clothing. “We view the potential tuck-in acquisition of TATEX and recent agreement to acquire Opek in Poland as good strategic purchases with relatively low risk,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note. “We reiterate our Buy rating as we see compelling value at current levels given U.S. domestic package consolidation, solid pricing trends, and better margins at FedEx Ground.” FedEx shares were up 2.8 percent in afternoon trading at $90.63 on the New York Stock Exchange, for an 8.5 percent gain year-to-date.

86,FDX,FedEx to buy France's TATEX to expand in Europe,"(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N) said Thursday its Express arm will buy privately held French package delivery company TATEX to expand its express delivery network in Europe. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. TATEX, with a central hub near Paris, employs more than 1,000 people and carries 19 million packages a year. Its annual revenue is about 150 million euros ($194 million). FedEx, the world’s No. 2 package delivery company, has said it plans to grow organically and through small “tuck-in” purchases in Europe. In March, FedEx beat Wall Street’s quarterly profit estimate but lowered its outlook for the rest of the year based on tepid economic growth and expectations of a mild euro zone recession. FedEx’s gradual expansion comes as No. 1 package delivery group United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) is in the midst of its purchase of Dutch peer TNT Express NV TNTE.AS for about $6.8 billion, the largest takeover in FedEx’s nearly 105-year history. “The TATEX business complements FedEx existing operations in the French market, and will enable the company to provide additional local services in one of Europe’s largest geographies,” Chief Executive Fred Smith said in a statement. He said the takeover shows “we are continuing to systematically and strategically invest in growing our network” in Europe, the Middle East, Indian subcontinent and Africa (EMEA) region. FedEx entered the French market in 1985 and employs more than 3,000 people there. It expanded its EMEA hub at Paris’ Roissy Charles de Gaulle Airport in 2009, making it the biggest FedEx Express hub outside of the United States. Analysts at Stifel Nicolaus estimated the TATEX purchase in the range of $75 million to $120 million, at most. “While UPS tries to figure out how to integrate its European operations with those of TNT, we prefer to own FedEx, which should have a much easier time growing with these smaller, less risky integrations,” the analysts said in a note. Last month FedEx said it would buy family-owned Polish shipping company Opek, also for undisclosed terms. Separately on Thursday, FedEx said its Office unit will sell the Japanese operations, including 61 printing centers, to Konica Minolta for $44 million. The transaction will close on or about May 31 after regulatory approval, FedEx spokesman Jess Bunn said. FedEx shares were down 0.2 percent at $86.91 at midday on the New York Stock Exchange.

FedEx will retire 18 Airbus A310-200 aircraft and 26 related engines, as well as six Boeing MD10-10 aircraft and 17 related engines. The majority of these aircraft are currently parked and not in revenue service, FedEx said in a statement. The company has already retired five aircraft this quarter and plans to shed 21 more in the next fiscal to modernize its fleet. “Along with the decisions to retire these 50 aircraft, we are also developing detailed operating and cost structure plans to further improve our efficiency,” FedEx Express Chief Executive David Bronczek said in a statement. The company said FedEx Express is shortening the depreciable lives of some aircraft. The accelerated depreciation on these aircraft is expected to total $196 million over the next three fiscal years.

94,FDX,FedEx to slash costs as global outlook dim,"(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N) is stepping up cost-cutting measures to boost profit margins as sluggish global economic growth curbs shipping volumes and increases customer demand for lower-priced delivery options. The company’s profit outlook fell short of analysts’ estimates, but shares were up more than 3 percent after FedEx said it was taking steps to slice expenses and drive up margins in express shipping, its biggest division. “We are firmly convinced that we can get Express to double-digit margins,” from current single-digit growth, Chief Executive Fred Smith told investors on a conference call. Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx told analysts it will provide more details on its cost-cutting initiatives at its investor meeting in October. The company is upgrading its fleet to improve fuel efficiency and in December said it would buy new Boeing Co (BA.N) aircraft to replace some aging planes, while delaying the delivery of other aircraft to trim expenses. “They’re doing the right things,” said Adi Padva, research analyst for Neuberger Berman Large Cap Disciplined Growth team, which holds FedEx shares. Revenue per package in the express segment rose 6 percent in the fourth quarter due to higher rates per pound, fuel surcharges and growth of premium services, even as volume declined 5 percent. International priority revenue per package rose 3 percent while average daily volume declined 3 percent, driven by year-over-year declines from Asia. The massive volume of goods moved by FedEx makes its shipping trends a closely watched indicator of consumer demand and economic growth. Moderate global economic growth that keeps shippers conservative will continue into the next year, FedEx said. “We believe U.S. domestic and global economic conditions will be impacted by the European debt crisis, slowing growth in Asia,” Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf said on the call. “These weaker global economic conditions have driven a shift by our customers from premium services to our deferred products. We expect that trend to continue in 2013.” FedEx, whose fiscal 2013 began earlier this month, said it also faces cost increases, including higher pension expenses and depreciation costs. The company said it sees profit per share of $1.45 to $1.60 in its first quarter and $6.90 to $7.40 in fiscal 2013. The quarterly forecast was below the $1.70 average expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For the full year, the average estimate is $7.39 per share. The outlook “does not include the impacts of the significant cost reduction programs currently under review that should be announced in the fall,” the company said in a statement. “The fact that the guidance doesn’t include any restructuring and that they say they can go back to double-digit growth in the operating margins of their Express business, gives the market optimism that earnings can be much higher than what they actually guide now,” Padav said. The company also hopes to match the size and volume of its packages to the size and type of its aircraft. FedEx said on June 4 it was accelerating its aircraft retirement schedule, and taking a related net charge of $84 million, or 26 cents per share, in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, FedEx’s freight division, which hauls goods with an average weight of 1,000 pounds and is mainly business-to-business, is raising rates by 6.9 percent on many shipments, effective July 9. Rates increased in other segments early in the year. The guidance was “slightly disappointing,” but is likely to be revised upward at October investor meeting, after cost-cutting measures such as retiring the “gas-guzzling” aircraft take hold, said Kevin Sterling , BB&T; Capital Markets analyst in Richmond, Virginia. FedEx reported net profit for its fiscal fourth quarter ended May 31 of $550 million, or $1.73 per share, down from $558 million, or $1.75 per share, a year earlier. But adjusted profit before items was $1.99 per share, up from $1.75 a year before and above the $1.92 average forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 4 percent to $11.0 billion, near the $11.1 billion Wall Street estimate. FedEx announced the purchase of three companies in its most recent quarter - in Poland, France and Brazil - in keeping with its stated strategy of expanding in Europe by growing organically and with small “tuck-in” purchases. Last week, it said it completed the takeover of one of them, family-owned Polish courier company Opek Sp z.o.o., which has an estimated $70 million in annual revenue. FedEx is “in the position that we don’t have to make any acquisitions in any sector,” Smith said. United Parcel Service (UPS.N), the No. 1 package delivery company, is in the midst of the largest takeover in its nearly 105-year history, the purchase of TNT Express TNTE.AS for about $6.8 billion. FedEx’s shares were up 3.4 percent at $91.54 in afternoon trading on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

This order is in addition to FedEx Express’ agreement with Boeing announced in December 2011 to buy 27 new 767s for delivery between fiscal 2014 and 2018 and to delay delivery of 11 of the 777 aircraft to save on fuel and cut costs. The company said on June 19 it was focused on cost cuts to boost profit margins during a prolonged period of slow global economic growth. The latest purchase announced on Friday is for planes that will be delivered from fiscal 2015 to 2019 and will replace current MD-10 and A310-200 aircraft, FedEx said. The new planes provide similar capacity as the MD-10s, but are about 30 percent more fuel-efficient and reduce unit operating costs by more than 20 percent, the company said. FedEx, the world’s No. 2 package delivery company, said the 19 new aircraft on order include four that used money previously applied to orders for four 777 aircraft. Financial terms were not disclosed. “FedEx Express is positioning itself for more profitable growth by modernizing its aircraft fleet and better aligning its U.S. domestic air network to match current and anticipated shipment volumes,” FedEx Express Chief Executive Officer David Bronczek said in a statement.

100,FDX,FedEx risks losing $1 billion-plus Post Office contract to UPS,"(Reuters) - Package-delivery company FedEx Corp (FDX.N) risks losing its business with the U.S. Postal Service, worth more than $1 billion a year, when the beleaguered postal service puts the contract up for bid next year. The postal service alerted FedEx that it will seek bids for the contract after it expires in September 2013, FedEx said in a regulatory filing late on Monday. That clears the way for larger competitor United Parcel Service (UPS.N) to grab the business - domestic air transportation for first-class, priority and express mail - that FedEx has had since 2000. FedEx, the No. 2 package delivery company, signed its first contract in 2000 and started providing postal service in April 2001. In 2006, it signed an extension through September 2013. “By flying some of the fastest growing and most successful postal products, FedEx Express continues to provide the Postal Service and postal customers important services,” FedEx spokesman Jess Bunn said on Tuesday. “We look forward to continuing our excellent relationship.” FedEx is the postal service’s top contractor, earning an estimated $1.5 billion in revenue in fiscal 2011 from this business, according to Husch Blackwell LLP’s postal service contracting practice group. UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, earned about $100 million in revenue during that period. “UPS has informed the U.S. Postal Service that it definitely intends to bid on this work,” said UPS spokesman Norman Black. Dahlman Rose analyst Helane Becker said the contract loss would be small compared FedEx’s $42.7 billion in revenue, but disruptive. “We believe the probability of FedEx losing the USPS contract is relatively small, but until we hear confirmation otherwise, the contract renewal will cast an overhang on the stock,” she wrote in a note. “UPS’s current contract is dwarfed by FedEx’s and would give the company a solid boost to earnings,” she said. Shares of Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx were down 0.9 percent in midafternoon trading at $91.04 on the New York Stock Exchange and up 9 percent so far this year. FedEx is focused on cost-cutting to boost profit margins with sluggish economic growth curbing shipping volumes and leading customers to demand lower-priced delivery options. Chief Executive Fred Smith in June said the company would provide greater detail of its planned Express division restructuring at its October analyst meetings. “The timing of contract expiration — a year following FedEx’s expected restructuring announcement — provides FedEx visibility to plan for any potential loss of business and resulting impact to network utilization,” Robert W. Baird analysts led by Benjamin Hartford wrote in a note. FedEx also said it is preparing to remove about 5,000 drop boxes at U.S. Postal Service locations in about 340 metropolitan areas, in line with a separate agreement that expired in June.

The job cuts follow a warning from the company in June that it needed to cut costs in the face of the European debt crisis and slowing growth in Asia.

107,FDX,"FedEx slashes forecast, citing weak global economy","(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the world’s second-largest package delivery company, cut its profit outlook for the current quarter, saying weakness in the global economy was hurting demand for overnight international shipments more than anticipated. The new forecast pushed FedEx shares down 3.5 percent in after-hours trading. For its first fiscal quarter ended August 31, Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx expects to earn $1.37 to $1.43 per share. The company previously expected earnings of $1.45 to $1.60 per share for the period. Analysts expect earnings of $1.56 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue at the FedEx Express business, the company’s largest and which transports parcels internationally, has been affected by “weakness in the global economy,” the company said in a statement. A FedEx spokesman declined to say which regions are the most affected, but added that more detail will be available when quarterly results are released on September 18. “If you look at the recent international trends, they’ve certainly been weaker,” William Blair & Co analyst Nathan Brochmann said. “I really don’t think this is a terrible shock.” The lower forecast comes after rival United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) lowered its 2012 earnings forecast in July and capacity in Asia, bemoaning “global economic uncertainty. FedEx’s last quarterly earnings report in June fell short of expectations and the company promised it would respond by cutting expenses and boosting margins at FedEx Express. But Tuesday’s forecast cut effectively means the company was unable to boost margins in that unit amid the tough economic landscape. The massive volume of goods moved by FedEx makes its shipping trends a closely watched indicator of consumer demand and economic growth.

Equities seesawed between positive and negative territory throughout the session but in general held steady on media reports European policymakers would unveil a bond-buying plan to bring down crippling borrowing costs in debt-troubled euro zone economies. Those reports offset a sell-off at FedEx Corp, which late Tuesday cut its quarterly profit outlook on weakness in the global economy. The stock, which is viewed as a proxy for business activity, fell 1.6 percent to $86.13. United Parcel Service fell 2 percent to $72.23 and the Dow Jones Transportation index lost 1.1 percent. “While FedEx is only one company, it’s one whose warning is indicative of the global economic slowdown we’re dealing with,” said Leo Grohowski, chief information officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management in New York. Central Bank sources told Reuters the ECB was ready to waive seniority status on government bonds it buys under a new program which it is set to agree on at Thursday’s Governing Council meeting. Bloomberg earlier reported that the ECB would, with broad support from its council members, unveil an unlimited, sterilized program of bond purchases. The ECB has been expected to be cautious about disclosing the size of its bond-buying, given opposition from Germany’s central bank. Further details of the plan will be revealed by ECB President Mario Draghi after Thursday’s meeting, but some analysts cautioned the ECB may opt to wait until after the German constitutional court rules on the region’s bailout funds on Sept. 12 to announce any new steps. “These reports are helping the market turn around despite FedEx, but while some of the rhetoric coming out of Europe has been positive, we’ll need to see follow-through in actions now,” said Grohowski, who helps oversee $171 billion in client assets. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 20.71 points, or 0.16 percent, at 13,056.65. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was up 0.10 points, or 0.01 percent, at 1,405.04. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 0.87 points, or 0.03 percent, at 3,074.19. Equities have received a boost in recent months on expectations the ECB would start buying Spanish and Italian government bonds to ease the pressure on those countries’ bond markets and that the Federal Reserve will adopt new stimulus to prop up the economy.

The world’s second-largest package delivery company last month cut its 2013 profit forecast, blaming a growing shift by corporate customers to shipping goods by sea rather than air due in part to increases in jet fuel prices and in part to slowing economic growth. “We intend to improve annual profitability substantially in our FedEx Express segment,” Chief Executive Fred Smith said, speaking at a dinner with investors and analysts in Memphis that was broadcast over the Internet.

124,FDX,FedEx sees holiday shipping volume rising 13 percent,"(Reuters) - FedEx Corp on Monday forecast a 13 percent annual increase in holiday shipping volume, driven by e-commerce and last-minute orders, but stuck to its view of a tepid economy that is pushing customers to pick cheaper shipping options. The company plans to hire 20,000 seasonal workers, the same as last year, when its holiday deliveries rose 10 percent, to handle the more than 280 million shipments it expects during the season between Thanksgiving and Christmas. “On-line shopping is here to stay regardless of economic concerns,” said Kevin Sterling, BB&T; Capital Markets analyst in Richmond, Virginia. “A lot of this is going through SmartPost, a cheaper delivery option. Customers are moving to a slower mode of shipping, which drives down (FedEx’s) revenue per package.” FedEx, closely watched as an indicator of consumer demand and economic health, said an increase in holiday shipments was already included in its fiscal 2013 earnings outlook. FedEx twice this year has cut its 2013 global forecast, citing slower growth in China, recession in some European economies and high energy prices. The company also reduced its profit outlook because customers have been opting for slower and less expensive shipping options. FedEx can add the same number of seasonal workers as last year because it has been hiring staff through 2012, especially at its Ground and SmartPost divisions, which will handle the bulk of the holiday volume, said T. Michael Glenn, executive vice president of market development and corporate communications. The company said December 10 - so-called Green Monday - is expected to be its busiest day ever with some 19 million shipments - a 10 percent increase from last year. E-commerce will drive the shipping volume on Green Monday, which falls on the second Monday of December and kicks off the heaviest online shopping week of the year. Green Monday was the third heaviest shopping day after Cyber Monday and Black Friday last year — two shopping days that follow the Thanksgiving holiday. “Despite everything we read, the world’s not ending, at least not before Christmas this year,” said Jeffrey Kauffman, a managing director at Sterne Agee. As more shoppers buy their holiday gifts on the Internet or via mobile phone, it means higher shipping volume for FedEx and United Parcel Service - both of which have delivery contracts with most of the large Internet retailers. Delivery volumes for FedEx’s busiest day of the year have consistently grown, and will be nearly double the 9.8 million shipments it handled in 2005. FedEx has gained share of catalog and other Internet orders via SmartPost in which it delivers packages to the U.S. Postal Service, which in turn makes final delivery to residential customers, Kauffman noted. SmartPost average daily package deliveries jumped 18 percent to 1.7 million in fiscal 2012. U.S. retail sales are expected to rise 4.1 percent this holiday season, a slower pace than in prior years, according to the National Retail Federation. Online holiday sales, excluding travel, are expected to increase 16.8 percent from last year to as much as $54.5 billion, FedEx said, citing eMarketer data. “We always see a significant push for last-minute orders, and a lot of it has to do with procrastination, which for FedEx is a good thing during the holiday season,” FedEx’s Glenn said in an interview. FedEx said 82 percent of its ground deliveries are shipped in three business days or less, 61 percent are delivered in 2 business days or less, and 24 percent are delivered the next business day. “There are a lot of high-tech products out there and people are saving money in other places to spend on these goods,” Glenn said. “We certainly are expecting a strong peak season for FedEx.” UPS, the largest package delivery company, could give insight into its seasonal hiring plans when it reports quarterly results on Tuesday. UPS added about 55,000 workers for the holidays last year, 10 percent more than it hired in 2010.

UPS added the same amount of workers in 2011 to keep pace with a similar increase in holiday shipments. The world’s largest package delivery company, and rival FedEx Corp, are closely watched for indications of consumer demand, the health of retailers and the state of the economy. The company estimates it will deliver 527 million packages between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which would top last year’s record of 480 million, driven by e-commerce. As shoppers buy more of their holiday gifts over the Internet, this means more shipping volume for FedEx and UPS, which each have delivery contracts with most of the biggest e-tailers. Large chain stores including Toys R Us [TOY.UL}, Kohl’s Corp , Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Macy’s Inc plan on adding more holiday workers than last year, based on the view that consumers will spend modestly more this year as the economy mends gradually. Improved technology and productivity will help UPS handle the increased shipping volume with the same amount of seasonal hires as last year, said spokesman Susan Rosenberg. UPS said its busiest day of the year will be Dec. 20, with an estimated 28 million packages delivered. That would be up from 27 million on its busiest days last year. Typically, it handles 15.8 million packages daily. “Once again, the popularity of e-commerce and mobile accessibility are likely to delay online shopping and compress deliveries into the final two weeks before Christmas,” UPS said in a statement. This year, global economic weakening and concerns about expiring U.S. tax cuts could also keep more consumers waiting until the last minute and searching for discounts before ordering holiday gifts. Retailers are keeping inventory fairly lean, so a bigger-than expected jump in demand could boost demand for the quick deliveries offered by UPS and FedEx. UPS last week reported lower quarterly profit and “some uncertainty” about the strength of the coming holiday season. FedEx, the No. 2 package delivery company, has said it plans to keep this year’s seasonal hires at 20,000, the same as last year, to handle volume that it expects will be 13 percent higher than last year. Analysts said that while shipping volume is increasing, delivery companies face revenue constraints as frugal customers opt for cheaper shipping methods.",10292012,http://www.reuters.com/article/ups-holidays-forecast/ups-sees-10-pct-rise-in-holiday-shipping-to-hire-55000-workers-idUSL1E8L4DMQ20121029

Rating Action As Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services previously announced, on Nov. 2, 2012, we affirmed our ‘BBB’ corporate credit and unsecured debt ratings on FedEx Corp. The outlook is stable. At the same time, we lowered the ratings on the 1998-A and 1999-A equipment trust certificates (EETCs) to ‘BBB+’ from ‘A-‘ and on the 1998-B and 1999-B EETCs to ‘BBB’ from ‘BBB+’. We affirmed the ratings on the 1998-C and 1999-C EETCs at ‘BBB’. Rationale Our affirmation of the corporate credit rating on Memphis, Tenn.-based FedEx Corp. reflects our expectation that the company will continue to generate credit ratios that are appropriate for the rating despite pressures from a weak global economy. Lowering the rating on selected EETCs is based on our assessment that there is an increasing risk that FedEx would seek to renegotiate payments on these issues, which could cause a default, in a bankruptcy scenario. The values of the aircraft that secure these EETCs have declined more rapidly than the certificates are paid down, reducing collateral coverage. We believe that there would be few alternate operators for these airplanes in the very difficult economic environment that would accompany a FedEx bankruptcy. We did not lower the rating on the 1998 and 1999 Class C certificates because we already rate them at the level of senior unsecured debt. The ratings on FedEx reflect the transportation services company’s strong competitive position, moderate financial policies, and good cash-generating capability. Its participation in competitive markets with significant capital expenditure and investment requirements and exposure to cyclical pressures offsets those factors somewhat. Standard & Poor’s categorizes FedEx’s business risk profile as “satisfactory” and its financial risk profile as “intermediate,” as defined by our criteria. Although its largest operating unit, FedEx Express (the founder and leading participant in the air express segment of the domestic package express industry), still contributes the majority of revenues (62% of total revenues in fiscal 2012), FedEx has become a much more diversified company in recent years and now has a well-established global footprint, offering its customers a full range of transportation and logistics services. While FedEx lacks a ground network in Europe, it does have a sizeable European express business, primarily focused on intercontinental services. FedEx is pursuing an organic growth strategy in Europe and currently participates in specific European domestic markets. The proposed merger of rival United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS, A+/Negative/A-1) and TNT Express N.V. (BBB+/Watch Pos/A-2) is likely to be a modest competitive disadvantage for FedEx, but we believe that FedEx will remain a strong competitor in the region. Cross-selling its portfolio of services and continuing its geographic expansion are key elements of the company’s growth strategy. FedEx has a substantial market position in each of its business segments and has been gaining share in its ground business. Most of the markets in which FedEx competes have significant barriers to entry. However, FedEx faces formidable competition from a handful of other integrated service providers, as well as from a wide range of companies competing in specific market segments. FedEx uses independent contractors to pick up and deliver shipments at FedEx Ground. The company is facing a number of lawsuits arguing that workers in this segment should not be classified as independent contractors and is vigorously defending its current business model. Our ratings assume that the structure of this business will not change significantly. We believe FedEx will continue to benefit from initiatives to improve yield (revenue per shipment) across its portfolio of businesses over the coming year and from its efforts to improve operating efficiency in its U.S. package delivery network. However, the economic outlook remains uncertain, as does the outlook for fuel prices. As a result, we believe the express business is likely to continue to experience volume pressure over at least the next few months, although continued strong growth in the ground business should offset this somewhat. FedEx recently unveiled a program designed to generate $1.7 billion in profit improvement by the end of fiscal 2016, with a significant portion of the improvement occurring in fiscal 2015. This is based on FedEx’s expectation of slow economic growth over the next two years. We believe that the initiatives the company is undertaking, including headcount reductions, fleet modernization, network optimization, and yield initiatives, will lead to improved operating efficiency. However, we do not expect a material improvement in credit metrics over the next two years, absent a significant improvement in the global economy. Our ratings incorporate our expectation that funds from operations (FFO) to total debt will average 30%-35% and that adjusted debt to capital will average 45%-55%. As of Aug. 31, 2012, these figures were 37% and 54%, respectively. Liquidity The short-term rating is ‘A-2’. We characterize FedEx’s liquidity as “strong” under our criteria. We expect that sources of cash will exceed uses by at least 1.5x over the next 12 to 24 months, the minimum requirement for such a designation. We believe sources will exceed uses even if EBITDA were to fall by 30%. Sources of liquidity include existing cash balances of more than $2 billion and anticipated cash flow. During fiscal 2012, FedEx generated about $4.8 billion in operating cash flow and spent $164 million on dividends. FedEx recently stated that it expects to increase its dividend payout modestly, but it gave no time frame for doing so. We believe the company can accommodate this increase without jeopardizing its credit quality. In the unexpected event that operating performance declines materially, we would expect the company to modify its dividend plans. We do not expect the company to engage in share buybacks, except to the extent needed to offset dilution from the exercise of stock options. We expect operating cash flow to decline this fiscal year, reflecting continuing high capital expenditures and recently completed acquisitions. The company spent $4 billion on capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 and is likely to spend a similar amount this year. We expect capital spending to moderate as the fleet renewal program winds down. Even so, capital expenditures will remain a significant use of cash flow because of the capital intensity of the industry. Debt maturities over the next few years are modest relative to liquidity. FedEx entered into a $1 billion, five-year credit agreement in April 2011, which replaced its existing $1 billion credit agreement. The financial covenant requires FedEx to maintain a leverage ratio of adjusted debt to capital of no greater than 70%. As of Aug. 31, 2012, this ratio was 53.5%. Bank lines support the firm’s commercial paper (CP) borrowings. It had none outstanding as of Aug. 31, 2012. Outlook The outlook is stable. We believe FedEx will face some operating challenges over the coming year because of the uncertain economic environment and reduced demand in its express business. The company is addressing these challenges through yield and efficiency improvement initiatives. As a result, we do not expect credit metrics to materially decline. Over the longer term, we believe the company’s recently announced profit improvement program will lead to improved operating results and credit metrics. However, we do not expect significant improvement until at least fiscal 2014. If operating performance exceeds our expectations and FFO to debt increases to 40% and we believe it will stay there, we could raise the ratings. While we think this is unlikely, we could lower ratings if unanticipated operating challenges or weaker-than-expected demand results in FFO to debt falling to less than 25% and we expect it to remain there.

129,FDX,FedEx to hike ground shipping rates 4.9 percent in 2013,"(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the No. 2 U.S. package-delivery company, said on Friday it will raise its average rates for ground shipments and home deliveries by 4.9 percent beginning in January.

The 78-year-old football legend fell to the floor after his 45-minute keynote speech at the Monona Terrace conference center in downtown Madison. “After a few minutes, he was feeling better and speaking well,” said Kevin Fischer, spokesperson for the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority, the host of the conference. Starr refused medical care from paramedics and left the conference with his wife, Cherry, in a limousine, Fischer said. “They went to the local airport here in Madison to fly back to Alabama,” Fischer said. “He rebounded quickly. He’s doing fine.” Starr, who lives in Alabama, is Packer royalty, having led the team to seven titles, including the first two Super Bowl championships.

134,FDX,FedEx profit drops less than investors feared,"(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N) profit fell 11.9 percent in the second quarter, less than investors had feared, as the No. 2 U.S. package delivery company struggled to improve results at its air freight business. Demand for air express shipments has fallen as customers turn to slower, less costly methods of delivering goods. Those declines were partly offset by strong growth at the company’s unit that ships goods by truck. “Over the last couple of years ... customers have opted to trade a bit of speed for a lower price,” Chief Executive Fred Smith told investors on Wednesday. “We’re moving it on the ground more as opposed to flying it as much.” As part of a restructuring plan announced in October, the company plans to shed some staff; it has extended a buyout offer that it expects thousands of U.S. workers to accept as it bids to trim costs at the air express unit, where profit slumped about 33 percent. FedEx reported fiscal second-quarter earnings of $438 million, or $1.39 per share, on Wednesday, compared with $497 million, or $1.57 per share, a year earlier. Disruptions relating to Superstorm Sandy - which walloped the East Coast late in October and killed more than 130 people - pulled earnings down by about 11 cents per share. Factoring out those charges, profit was $1.50 per share, more than the $1.41 analysts had forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “It’s mostly a continuation of the trends that we’ve been seeing, that is solid execution in the face of customers downshifting from premium products to more economy products,” said Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker, referring to a shift away from air express deliveries. “But we have to accept that today’s economy products are yesterday’s premium products. Sometimes getting it in two days by truck is fast enough.” FedEx shares rose 3 percent to $95.24, their highest since March, in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company’s ground business, meanwhile, is taking market share from larger rival, United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), a FedEx executive said. “There is no question that with our value proposition that we are taking some level of share,” said David Rebholz, who heads the company’s ground operation, which generates about a quarter of FedEx sales. “We’re absolutely winning the game over the long run.” Revenue grew 4.7 percent to $11.1 billion from $10.6 billion a year earlier. The company held steady its profit forecast for 2013 - it expects to earn $6.20 per share to $6.60 per share for the fiscal year through May. In September, FedEx had cut that forecast by about 10 percent. That forecast does not account for the costs of buying out thousands of workers, which could total $550 million to $650 million, the company said. At the end of its last fiscal year, FedEx employed about 300,000 people worldwide, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Its forecast also presumes that leaders in Washington will reach a deal soon to avert the “fiscal cliff” - steep spending cuts and tax hikes that come into effect in 2013, executives said. “Our outlook ... assumes that the U.S. does not go off the fiscal cliff and into a recession,” said Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf, on a conference call with stock analysts. FedEx said shipments relating to the holiday shopping season - a key period for U.S. retailers - were on track to set a record. FedEx shares have gained about 9 percent over the past 12 months, outperforming the 5-percent rise in shares of rival UPS. Still, both companies have underperformed the broader U.S. market; the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX has surged 19 percent over the same period.

140,FDX,FedEx rejects UPS offer of TNT Express assets-FT,"LONDON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Informal approaches by United Parcel Service to FedEx to sell a package of TNT Express assets have been rebuffed by its U.S. rival, making it potentially harder for UPS to win approval for its takeover of the Dutch delivery group, the Financial Times reported. FedEx is refusing to engage in serious talks unless they cover a bigger slice of the TNT business, the newspaper said on Tuesday. The European Commission (EC), Europe’s competition watchdog, is worried that the 5.2 billion euros ($6.8 billion) takeover by UPS, the world’s no. 1 package delivery company, would leave only two other big players, Deutsche Post AG’s DHL and U.S.-based FedEx. In November, UPS and TNT said they planned to sell assets in order to meet European anti-trust concerns. Analysts and investors have said that FedEx wants the takeover to be blocked. French mail group DPD is currently the sole contender to buy the assets, which cover TNT subsidiaries in at least 16 European Union countries including Spain, the FT cited several people familiar involved with the clearance talks as saying. Joaquin Almunia, the EU’s competition chief, is however cautious about a sale to DPD as it does not have an air network and would rely on buying space in aircraft from its rival, which  has raised doubts about its future commitment to compete with UPS, the FT said. A TNT spokesman declined to comment on the FT report but said UPS and TNT were fully committed to the deal and were working closely with the EC. Fedex declined to comment while the EC and UPS were not immediately available to comment.",1072013,http://www.reuters.com/article/fedex-ups-tntexpress/fedex-rejects-ups-offer-of-tnt-express-assets-ft-idUSL5E9C7BAX20130107

143,FDX,UPDATE 6-TNT slumps as UPS pulls bid on EU veto,"* TNT Express shares down 42 pct, PostNL down 36 pct * EU told firms market position would be too strong * Efforts to hive off assets failed to find buyers * DHL rules out bid, FedEx in background By Sara Webb and Anthony Deutsch AMSTERDAM, Jan 14 (Reuters) - UPS is dropping its $7 billion bid for Dutch delivery firm TNT Express after European anti-trust regulators said they would veto it, leaving TNT’s future in doubt and almost halving the value of its shares. Shares in U.S.-based United Parcel Service Inc  gained 1.2 percent on Monday after the world leader in the sector said in a statement that European Union officials told it the EU executive Commission would veto the deal. An EU source confirmed that and said the decision could be made public as early as next week. UPS wanted to buy the smaller firm for its European network and assets in fast-growing Asia and Latin America. While the collapse of the 5.2 billion euro takeover means a rethink at UPS, the impact is far greater on TNT, which is struggling in a weak European market and lacks a strategy for developing on its own after nearly a year of negotiations on the merger. Investors wiped nearly 2 billion euros off its value as the share price dived 42 percent to 4.750 euros. The two companies offered to sell some operations to ease concerns about competition in Europe, where rivals FedEx Corp  and DHL had lobbied the Commission to block the deal, a banking source said. But UPS and TNT failed to find buyers and planned asset sales were not enough to satisfy EU officials. “It’s more than a minor setback” for UPS, said Kurt Hoefer, research analyst at portfolio manager Golub Group in San Mateo, California, which holds UPS shares. “It would have been a nice addition to have TNT’s domestic routes as part of the UPS system.” Having been blocked in its attempt at a large takeover, UPS will likely return to its prior strategy of pursuing strings of small deals on the continent, Hoefer said, adding, “I don’t think they have any alternative but to grow it organically.” UPS will pay TNT a termination fee of 200 million euros. Shares in U.S.-based FedEx were slightly firmer, up 0.3 percent, while those of DHL’s German parent Deutsche Post  were down by a similar margin. Deutsche Post’s finance chief told Reuters the company had no interest in buying TNT nor any other express delivery business. TNT faces an uncertain future. It has had to cut capacity in Europe in response to falling demand, was hit by restructuring problems in Brazil and is considered a minor player in China. Its chief executive quit soon after UPS made its offer in March. TNT had been partially split from Dutch postal operator PostNL in May 2011 in an attempt to profit from express operations as traditional mail business declines. But its weak performance quickly prompted activist shareholders to push for a management shake-up or an outright sale. “Now TNT will have to continue alone,” said Philip Scholte, an analyst at Rabobank. “TNT’s management will have to roll up their sleeves, come up with a plan and get down to work.” TNT, which reports annual results on Feb. 18, said it would update investors on its strategy in due course. Shares in PostNL, its biggest shareholder, plunged by over a third. A new merger proposal for TNT seems unlikely, at least in the short term. Its closest European rival, DHL, is bigger in Europe and would be unlikely to get EU competition approval. “FedEx is the only other option,” said analyst Maarten Bakker at ABN Amro. “And they are not going to be in any hurry because there is simply no rival bid.” Others suggested TNT would be a poor fit with FedEx. “They seem to be committed to faster-growing regions, and adding a thoroughly unionized European Union entity to the FedEx mix would certainly be a shock to that culture,” said Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker, who noted that few FedEx employees are unionized. A FedEx spokesman declined to comment on whether the company would pursue a bid for TNT. Any bid from an existing operator will face questions from an EU Commission concerned about prices being pushed up and wary of mergers that shrink any market to three players from four, as would have happened had UPS faced only FedEx and DHL. Competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said last week that UPS would need to create an equivalent rival to TNT before he would approve the deal. In the end, the U.S. firm seemed not to have done enough to help France’s DPD expand its challenge. UPS had offered to sell warehouses and customer bases in 15 countries, mainly in eastern Europe, and discussed divesting other assets, including some to FedEx, according to media reports. But FedEx and DPD did not take up offers of assets. “FedEx’s heavy lobbying against the deal didn’t help either, and more generally the lack of bidders was a problem,” said a source familiar with the deal. “FedEx didn’t offer to buy any of the assets on the block. La Poste-DPD were very close to buying the international express unit but it didn’t happen in the end.” UPS CEO Scott Davis voiced his disappointment: “We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC’s concerns with the transaction,” he said in a statement. The European Commission, however, was left unimpressed. In other anti-trust rulings recently, Almunia vetoed a $7.4 billion financial exchange merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse in February, saying the deal would have given the new company a lock on European futures trading. This month Hutchison Whampoa overcame his concerns that its purchase of Orange Austria would reduce competition in the Austrian telecoms market only by agreeing to help other companies break into the market. Universal Music Group staved off an EU veto on its $1.9-billion plan to buy EMI’s recorded music unit in September only after promising to sell some of the British firm’s most valuable labels, to get its market share below 40 percent.",1142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/ups-tntexpress/update-6-tnt-slumps-as-ups-pulls-bid-on-eu-veto-idUSL6N0AJ69220130114

145,FDX,Singh withdraws from Phoenix Open,"(Reuters) - Vijay Singh pulled out of the Phoenix Open on Thursday before the start of the first round, a day after admitting he had used deer antler spray which contains an ingredient banned by the PGA Tour. The former world number one, who was scheduled to tee off in the company of American Ryan Moore and Swede Carl Pettersson at the TPC Scottsdale, cited a back injury for his withdrawal. Singh, 49, was replaced in the field by American Richard H. Lee. A three-times major winner, Fijian Singh revealed earlier this week he had been using deer antler spray for a couple of months in an interview with Sports Illustrated magazine. On Wednesday, he issued a statement in which he expressed shock that the spray contained IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor), a natural anabolic hormone that stimulates muscle growth. “While I have used deer antler spray, at no time was I aware that it may contain a substance that is banned under the PGA Tour anti-doping policy,” said Singh, who has battled assorted health problems in recent years, especially with his back. “I am absolutely shocked that deer antler spray may contain a banned substance and am angry that I have put myself in this position. I have been in contact with the PGA Tour and am cooperating fully with their review of this matter.” The PGA Tour is now “looking into the matter” and has a variety of sanctions at its disposal, including disqualification, a one-year suspension for a first violation and up to five years for a second violation. Since the Tour’s anti-doping programme was launched in 2008, American journeyman Doug Barron is the only player who has been suspended for a violation. Barron, then 40, was banned for one year in November 2009 for taking a performance-enhancing drug.

151,FDX,FedEx cuts forecast as air freight weakness hits profit,"(Reuters) - FedEx Corp cut its full-year forecast after a worse-than-expected quarterly profit as customers shift from air express to slower but cheaper modes of international shipping. The No. 2 U.S. package-delivery company said it would step-up restructuring efforts, cut capacity in Asia and realign its global aircraft network to cut costs and boost earnings. Shares of the company, which has cut its full-year earnings forecast twice in the last six months, fell more than 5 percent in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. The company’s express unit, its biggest source of revenue, has been hit as more cost-conscious international customers opt to use container ships instead of costly overnight shipment by air. Operating income in the express unit fell 66 percent in the third-quarter ended February 28. FedEx said the express unit had underperformed largely due to weakness in Asia and other international markets, where margin pressures caused by excess capacity in the air freight industry had more than offset increased volumes. “We have a yield issue that exaggerated itself this quarter over last quarter,” Dave Bronczek, CEO of FedEx Express, said on a conference call with analysts. FedEx, the world’s biggest air freight company, plans to cut express capacity to and from Asia from April 1 and is looking at reducing its fleet by retiring more of its older, less-efficient aircraft, among other options to realign its network. The actions, along with cost cuts, will help the express unit perform better in the current quarter, Bronczek said. “They have got to lower their costs because they are getting paid a lot less for the packages they are shipping,” said BB&T; Capital Markets analyst Kevin Sterling. “It is hard for them to adjust quickly because we are talking about planes which cannot just be parked in the garage overnight,” said Sterling, who doesn’t expect margins to improve for a few quarters. Atlantic Equities analyst Rorrie Mars said FedEx’s cost-cutting plans would be enough to boost earnings but margins would remain under pressure for the next couple of quarters. FedEx, considered an economic bellwether because of the massive volume of goods it moves, forecast fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.90 to $2.10 per share. Analysts on average expect $2.07 per share. The company now expects a profit of $6.00 to $6.20 per share for fiscal 2013 ending May 31. It had earlier forecast $6.20 to $6.60 per share. Analysts on average expect earnings of $6.31 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Our forecast calls for modest growth in the global economy,” Chief Executive Fred Smith said on the call. “The calendar 2013 outlook certainly remains uncertain due mainly to policy issues in the U.S., Europe and China.” Rival United Parcel Service Inc, which reported quarterly results in January, forecast weaker-than-expected 2013 profit, citing an uneven global economy. UPS has less exposure to international markets than FedEx, Mars said. It also has more ground operations than air. FedEx announced plans in October to improve profits by $1.7 billion over four years by cutting costs in the express unit. FedEx said a number of its executives accepted voluntary buyouts in early February, and that it had notified thousands more of their eligibility for buyouts. On Wednesday, the company said it had cut its estimate of charges in fiscal 2013 resulting from the buyouts by $100 million, to $450 million to $550 million, mainly because of a hiring freeze. Third-quarter net income fell 31 percent to $361 million, or $1.13 per share. Excluding items, FedEx earned $1.23 per share. Revenue rose 4 percent to $11.0 billion. Analysts expected earnings of $1.38 per share on revenue of $10.85 billion. FedEx shares were trading at $100.53 at midday, down 5.6 percent. UPS shares were down 0.5 percent at $84.64.

European Union lawmakers agreed to bar bankers in Europe from getting bonuses bigger than their salaries, approving the proposal with only minor tweaks to appease the UK. JPMorgan Chase & Co’s board is expected reject calls from some shareholders to strip Jamie Dimon of his chairman title and back the current structure in the wake of the company’s “London Whale” trades. PC maker Hewlett-Packard suffered a shareholder protest vote at its annual meeting on Wednesday, but its chairman and members of the board survived calls for their removal. FedEx Corp said it would step up restructuring efforts, cut capacity in Asia and realign its global aircraft network to cut costs and boost earnings as it cut its full-year forecast.

The company said it took an impairment charge of $100 million in May due to the aircraft retirement plan and said it expects an additional expense of $74 million in 2014. “With the planned acquisition of new aircraft and projected slower economic growth than previously forecast, FedEx Express is lowering maintenance costs by aggressively parking and retiring aircraft,” Chief Executive David Bronczek said. FedEx last year unveiled a prolonged restructuring plan that includes updating and modernizing its air fleet. The company also declared a dividend of 15 cents a share, an increase of one cent a share over the previous dividend payment.

162,FDX,US STOCKS-Wall St drops after Bernanke hints at slowing stimulus,"* Shares tumble after Fed chief signals stimulus could be pared back * Fed maintains pace of bond purchases for the present * REITs slump after Bernanke comments * Adobe, FedEx rise after results; Sprint tumbles * Indexes off: Dow 1.3 pct, S&P; 500 1.4 pct, Nasdaq 1.1 pct By Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK, June 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell more than 1 percent on Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the central bank would start to reduce its stimulus measures later this year if the economy  is strong enough. Equities have been closely tethered to ultra-loose monetary policy, which has been key to the S&P;’s climb of more than 14 percent so far this year. Benchmark 10-year U.S. bond yields jumped to a 15-month high on expectations the Fed will reduce its bond buying. Bernanke said at a news conference the Fed may reduce its bond-buying program with the goal of ending it in mid-2014. While investors have expected the Fed to pull back on its stimulus, Bernanke’s comments gave the most explicit timeline to markets, causing stocks to tumble on heavy volume. In the days leading up to the Fed announcement, stocks had swung between modest losses and breakeven. “I was surprised he addressed the issue of tapering, since last time he did we saw a fairly significant market hiccup,” said Randy Bateman, chief investment officer of Huntington Asset Management in Columbus, Ohio. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 205.96 points, or 1.34 percent, at 15,112.27. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 22.89 points, or 1.39 percent, at 1,628.92. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 38.98 points, or 1.12 percent, at 3,443.20. Shortly before Bernanke spoke at a news conference, Fed policymakers said in a statement the Fed would keep buying $85 billion in bonds per month and gave no explicit indication that it was close to scaling back the stimulus program. About 6.65 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, above the daily average so far this year of about 6.36 billion shares. “If the economic growth we have is sustainable without the Fed, that’s good news,” added Bateman, who helps oversee $15 billion. “But it is hard to wean the system off the easy money.” The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 1 9/32, with the yield rising to a 15-month high of 2.3325 percent. The S&P; 500 rose for the two days before the Fed decision on confidence that current stimulus would be left in place even if Bernanke nods at the need to begin reducing bond purchases later in the year. The stimulus helped the stock market reach a record high on May 21, one day before Bernanke said the Fed could reduce its bond-buying in the “next few meetings” if the economy gained momentum. His comments rocked markets, boosting bond yields and halting stocks’ rally. Despite the increased volatility of the past month, the market has moved largely sideways. The S&P; 500 is about 2.4 percent below its record high of 1,669.16, reached May 21. More than four-fifths of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange fell while 70 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares ended lower. Real estate investment trusts, whose dividends attracted investors during the low interest-rate period, were among the hardest hit on Wednesday. The benchmark MSCI US REIT index  was down 3.1 percent, with Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust off 2 percent to $19.19 and Simon Property Group down 2.9 percent to $162.52. REITs are exempt from corporate-level income tax if the companies distribute at least 90 percent of their taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders. Since Bernanke began to signal the possible end of the policy, the index is down 12 percent. Shares of Adobe Systems Inc rose 5.6 percent to $45.78 a day after the maker of Photoshop and Acrobat software reported a higher-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit. FedEx Corp reported higher quarterly profit than expected as its ground shipment business improved. Shares were up 1.1 percent at $100.54. After the market closed, Jabil Circuit Inc fell 1.6 percent in extended trading after it reported a steep drop in quarterly profits, while Micron Technology Inc lost 1.5 percent to $13.76. Red Hat Inc rose 3.9 percent to $48 after the closing bell. The company posted a strong jump in earnings and revenue. On the downside, Sprint Nextel was both the most heavily traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange and one of the biggest decliners on the S&P; 500, down 4.4 percent to $7. Japan’s SoftBank cleared a major hurdle in its attempt to buy Sprint as rival bidder Dish Network  declined to make a new offer after SoftBank sweetened its own bid last week.",6192013,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-usa-stocks/us-stocks-wall-st-drops-after-bernanke-hints-at-slowing-stimulus-idUSL2N0EV25W20130619
163,FDX,"FedEx posts higher-than expected profit, will cut more capacity","(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday as it cut costs and its U.S. truck business continued to pick up steam. Shares were up 2.3 percent to $101.80 Wednesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange while the broader S&P; 500 was trading down 0.13 percent. The company, considered an economic bellwether because of the massive volume of goods it moves around the world, is cutting costs and jobs to adjust to higher demand for less expensive international shipping. In addition to cutting jobs, FedEx is taking steps to rein in costs, including retiring older, less efficient airplanes and raising shipping rates. The company’s express unit, its biggest source of revenue, has suffered as more cost-conscious international customers opt to substitute costly overnight air shipments with cheaper shipping. FedEx had said earlier that the express unit had underperformed largely due to weakness in Asia and other international markets, where margin pressure caused by excess capacity in the air freight industry had more than offset increased volumes. Companies like Apple and Samsung have seen demand for their smartphones soften in recent months, and many analysts have cut back on their shipment forecasts accordingly. “I would assume about 40 percent of FedEx’s international priority shipments out of China are tech and telecoms,” said Peter Nesvold, analyst with Jefferies & Co. “What happens in that segment does matter for this company.” International priority shipment volumes fell 2 percent during the quarter, while international export revenue per package fell 2 percent as rates dropped. In contrast, bigger rival United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), the world’s No. 1 package delivery company, said in April that its international package business will drive results in the near term and that it expects the small-package market to grow faster than the U.S. economy in 2013. Adjusted operating margins for the company’s ground transport segment were 20.1 percent, almost triple that of its express segment. Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker said the company could consider expanding that business to Canada and Mexico to boost earnings. He also said the company’s forecast of a 7 percent to 13 percent increase in full-year earnings, excluding special items, was conservative. Schoonmaker said that though the earnings outlook could be seen as conservative, the numbers for the quarter did not change FedEx’s standing among rivals. “We still think the shares are a buy,” he said. The company said earlier this month that it would permanently retire or will speed up the retirement of 86 aircraft and more than 300 engines as it modernizes its fleet. It is also increasing rates for its FedEx Freight subsidiary by an average of 4.5 percent, effective July 1. “Our profit improvement program is progressing, but we continue to see the effects of customers selecting lower-rate international services,” Chief Financial Officer Alan B. Graf Jr. said. “FedEx Express will further decrease capacity between Asia and the United States in July.” FedEx reported net income of $303 million, or 95 cents a share, for the fourth quarter ended May 31, compared with $550 million, or $1.73 a share, a year earlier. (Graphic: link.reuters.com/cyh98t) Excluding costs of a business realignment program and aircraft impairment charges, the company earned $2.13 a share. Analysts on average were expecting $1.96, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 3.6 percent to $11.4 billion, with FedEx Express revenue up 3 percent at $6.98 billion. Revenue for the ground segment was $2.78 billion, up 12 percent. FedEx Ground’s average daily volume grew 10 percent in the quarter, helped by market share gains and growth in e-commerce. For its new fiscal year FedEx forecast earnings growth of 7 percent to 13 percent, excluding special items, assuming U.S. gross domestic product growth of 2.3 percent, world GDP growth of 2.7 percent and the current outlook for fuel prices. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $7.31 a share, which would be about 11 percent higher than last year. They termed the outlook conservative. “FedEx’s full-year guidance is readily achievable and creates a lower hurdle rate for success if the economy were to improve at a faster-than-expected rate,” Duetsche Bank analyst Justin Yagerman wrote in a note. Oppenheimer analyst Scott Schneeberger said he expected earnings growth to accelerate in fiscal 2015 and 2016.

The central bank gave no explicit indication that it was close to pulling back on its program to buy $85 billion in bonds per month, a policy that has been a key to the market’s rally this year. Investors have speculated the Fed might start drawing down soon, contributing to a spate of volatility, though equities advanced strongly on both Monday and Tuesday ahead of the statement. “The fact that this is status quo is enough to put a little pressure on the market, largely because of the run-up we’ve seen over the past few days,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “This is something of a non-event statement.

168,FDX,US STOCKS-Wall St dips after recent rally as Fed statement looms,"* Fed statement, news conference in focus * Adobe shares up, FedEx up after results * Dow, S&P; off 0.2 pct, Nasdaq off 0.1 pct By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, June 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dipped modestly at the open on Wednesday, but held on to most of their gains over the last two days, ahead of a highly anticipated Federal Reserve statement and news conference. The Fed will release a policy statement at 2:00 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), which will be followed soon after by a news briefing with Chairman Ben Bernanke. “The early morning action is not surprising given the fact that we’ve had two days of position jockeying ahead of the (Fed)announcement,” said Andre Bakhos, director of market analytics at Lek Securities in New York. The advance this week so far suggested investors expect reassurances of continued economic support from the U.S. central bank. The equity market had been roiled recently by indications that the Fed’s asset purchases would be scaled back earlier than anticipated. Even as volatility had spiked in the wake of Bernanke’s comments to Congress May 22, which triggered investors’ angst over a winding-down of quantitative easing, equity markets have mostly traded sideways.

169,FDX,US STOCKS-Wall St to open little changed as Fed statement looms,"* Fed statement, news conference in focus * Adobe shares up, FedEx down after results * Futures: Dow off 6 pts, S&P; flat, Nasdaq up 4 pts By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, June 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set to open little changed on Wednesday, holding on to gains over the last two days, ahead of a highly anticipated Federal Reserve statement and news conference. The Fed will release a policy statement at 2:00 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), which will be followed soon after by a news briefing with Chairman Ben Bernanke. “The early morning action is not surprising given the fact that we’ve had two days of position jockeying ahead of the FOMC announcement,” said Andre Bakhos, director of market analytics at Lek Securities in New York. The advance this week so far suggested investors expect reassurances of continued economic support from the U.S. central bank. The equity market had been roiled recently by indications that the Fed’s asset purchases would be scaled back earlier than anticipated. Even as volatility has spiked in the wake of Bernanke’s comments to Congress May 22, which had triggered investors’ angst over a winding-down of quantitative easing, equity markets have mostly traded sideways. The S&P; 500 is now 1 percent below its record closing high set on May 21. “A well perceived statement, and the upside momentum will continue,” Bakhos said. “However, a statement which creates concern with Fed policy may prove to be a chance for the market to reverse its recent gains.” September futures for the S&P; 500 were flat in terms of fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures fell 6 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 4 points. Fed policymakers will likely announce that they will keep buying bonds at a monthly pace of $85 billion, while keeping their options open to scale back the program later this year if the U.S. labor market continues to improve. Shares of Adobe Systems Inc rose 7.9 percent to $46.80 in premarket trading a day after the maker of Photoshop and Acrobat software reported a higher-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit and said demand rose for Creative Cloud, the subscription-based version of its flagship software package. FedEx Corp posted a larger than expected quarterly profit as its ground shipment business did well, and the company saw benefits from lower jet fuel prices. Its shares were down 0.7 percent at $98.75 in premarket trading. Other S&P; 500 companies scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday include Jabil Circuit Inc, Micron Technology Inc and Red Hat Inc.

170,FDX,"Wall Street rises for fourth day on earnings hope, FedEx jumps","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks rose for the fourth session in a row on Tuesday as investors bet that companies will be able to surpass the low bar set for earnings season, leaving room for better-than-expected results that could drive the rally further. The push higher in recent days has taken the benchmark S&P; 500 to 1 percent below its all-time closing high of 1,669.16 reached on May 21. The gains also suggest that investors are becoming more comfortable with the prospect of the Federal Reserve slowing the pace of its economic stimulus, which has been a major driver of the equity rally this year. FedEx Corp (FDX.N) climbed on speculation that billionaire William Ackman would make a big investment in the company. FedEx shot up 4.4 percent to $103.15, its highest close since mid-March. Nine of the 10 S&P; 500 industry sector indexes ended higher. Material and industrial shares recorded the biggest gains after Alcoa Inc (AA.N) affirmed its global demand forecast for aluminum products when it reported results after Monday’s closing bell. Alcoa’s release is traditionally viewed as the unofficial start to earnings season. For the most part, analysts are expecting second-quarter results to be soft with weak sales, but expectations are for a pickup later in the year. Even so, investors are starting to think earnings expectations may have been ratcheted down too low. “We think we have the potential once again for an earnings season where expectations are a little too low, and when the earnings finally do come out, we could have a little bit of an upside surprise,” said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati. Analysts expect S&P; 500 companies’ earnings to grow 2.9 percent in the second quarter from a year ago, well below the 6.1 percent that was forecast in April, according to Thomson Reuters data. Forecasts for growth in the first quarter were similarly revised lower to as little as 1.5 percent. The earnings season ended up beating that with growth of 5.4 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 75.65 points, or 0.50 percent, to end at 15,300.34. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX rose 11.86 points, or 0.72 percent, to 1,652.32, the highest close since the end of May. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC climbed 19.43 points, or 0.56 percent, to close at 3,504.26. Alcoa reported adjusted profit and revenue above Wall Street forecasts after Monday’s closing bell. Still, its stock dipped 0.1 percent to $7.91. In contrast, the S&P; materials sector index .SPLRCM jumped 1.6 percent. The S&P; industrials index .SPLRCI climbed 1.5 percent. “(Analysts) have lowered the expectations enough that even if the numbers aren’t materially better, the outlooks will be more favorable than what is the consensus now,” said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc in Toledo, Ohio. “If Alcoa can do it with their clouds hanging over them, then these other sectors should have a lot of room to beat expectations and please investors.” The earnings calendar remains light until Friday when JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) are set to report results. Volatility has plunged in recent weeks on waning fears about imminent reductions in the Federal Reserve’s $85 billion a month of bond purchases. The Market Volatility Index .VIX, Wall Street’s favorite barometer of investor fear, has tumbled more than 30 percent since late June. On Tuesday, the VIX fell 2.9 percent to end at 14.35. “It almost seems like the market is starting to get more comfortable with the fact that the Fed could taper,” Detrick said. “We’re in a different area from where we would have been five or six weeks ago, where strong economic data was met with selling. Now good news is actually being perceived as good news.” The Fed will release the minutes from its June policy meeting on Wednesday. Investors will watch for clues into the timing of possible trimming of stimulus measures. Last month, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the economy is expanding strongly enough for the central bank to start slowing the pace of its bond-buying stimulus later this year. In the health-care sector, Health Management Associates Inc HMA.N has attracted takeover interest from Community Health Systems Inc (CYH.N) and other rivals about buying the hospital operator, sources said. Shares of Health Management surged 8.3 percent to $16.75. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG.O) shares slid 16.2 percent to $419.30 after the maker of the Da Vinci surgical robot said on Monday it expects second-quarter revenue below analysts’ expectations. Volume was roughly 5.8 billion shares on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the NYSE MKT, below the year-to-date average daily closing volume of 6.4 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a ratio of nearly 3 to 1. Advancers also had the upper hand on the Nasdaq, with three stocks gaining for nearly every two that fell.

173,FDX,FedEx rises on chatter Ackman may buy stake,"July 9 (Reuters) - Shares of FedEx Corp rose as much as 8 percent on Tuesday on speculation that billionaire investor William Ackman would make a big investment in the world’s No.2 package delivery company. Ackman wrote to clients on Monday asking them to commit $1 billion to two new funds by the end of next week to invest in a major U.S. company that he did not name. “The increasing volume in shares and options is being attributed to talk that activist investor Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square might be taking a stake in FedEx,” said WhatsTrading.com options strategist Frederic Ruffy. Ackman said the large-cap company he had in mind was engaged in a simple and predictable business that had high barriers to entry. Its stock also traded at a lower earnings multiple than its most comparable competitor, he said. Market speculation centered on FedEx as the company that best fit Ackman’s description. The company’s shares trade at 13.9 times forward 12-month earnings estimates of the most accurate analysts, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Shares of larger rival United Parcel Service Inc trade at 16.6 times. FedEx spokesman Jess Bunn said the company had no comment. A spokeswoman for Ackman was not immediately available. “We agree that the (FedEx) valuations are attractive but we’re not convinced that there is an opportunity for an activist investor to catalyst a big operational improvement at FedEx like there was at Canadian Pacific,” Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker said. A $1 billion investment would get Ackman a 3.2 percent stake in FedEx, based on the company’s market value of $31.32 billion as of July 8. Ackman has been investing in transport companies and fought a bitter proxy battle last year to overhaul Canadian Pacific , Canada’s No. 2 railway. FedEx shares were up 7 percent at $105.94 in heavy afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. UPS shares were up 3 percent. Option volume on FedEx was running eight times the daily average with 60,000 calls and 21,000 puts crossing the tape during the first half of Tuesday’s trading session, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.

181,FDX,US STOCKS-Wall St drifts lower as Fed decision looms,"* FOMC statement due at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT * Fed expected to be cautious with cuts to bond purchases * FedEx shares rise after results * Indexes off: Dow 0.4 pct; S&P; 0.2 pct; Nasdaq 0.2 pct By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, Sept 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dipped on Wednesday ahead of an announcement by the Federal Reserve on the future of an economic stimulus program that has been a main reason for Wall Street to hit record highs. Investors were hesitant to make big bets ahead of what is expected to be the first step by the Fed to take the economy off its massive quantitative easing stimulus program. Bets are that the Federal Open Market Committee will be cautious with cuts to its $85 billion in monthly asset buying when it announces its plans at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), while also seeking to reassure investors that an actual rise in interest rates is still distant. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke holds a press conference at 2:30 p.m. (1830 GMT). “We expect the consensus expectations to be met by the Fed,” said Jim Russell, senior equity strategist for U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Cincinnati. “The market would be surprised if there’s not a $10-to-$20 billion decline in monthly purchases announced today.” The Fed will also publish its fresh economic forecasts, and is expected to slow its growth predictions as well as lower its range for the unemployment rate. “We think the Fed’s view of the domestic economy is very important, it matters very much what they think despite perhaps their accuracy has been off a bit,” said Russell. Betting on S&P; 500 Index options suggests the market doesn’t see more volatility coming this week, even though the size of the reduction of the Fed program could be crucial to how it is received in the markets. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 55.35 points or 0.36 percent, to 15,474.38, the S&P; 500 lost 4 points or 0.23 percent, to 1,700.76 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 7.137 points or 0.19 percent, to 3,738.561. Volatility is expected after the statement, as has been the case during recent Fed meeting days. Looking beyond the Fed, market participants had an eye on the looming budget and debt limit debate in Washington. The White House said Wednesday the latest Republican proposal moves away from compromise.

182,FDX,FedEx signals better economy; express shipping rates to rise,"(Reuters) - Shares of FedEx Corp (FDX.N) jumped as much as 4 percent on Wednesday after the shipping company said cost cuts helped it to post a better-than-expected quarterly profit, and it announced rates would increase next year for express shipping amid improving global economic conditions. The company also backed its full-year profit outlook for earnings-per-share growth of 7 percent to 13 percent. FedEx, considered an economic bellwether because of the massive volume of goods it moves around the world, said on a conference call that the company was seeing “signs of improvement” in China and Europe. “The FedEx economic forecast calls for continued moderate growth both in the global and domestic economy,” Mike Glenn, executive vice president of market development, said on the call. FedEx said express shipping rates would increase an average 3.9 percent for U.S. domestic and international services, effective January 6. Rate increases for its ground courier facilities will be announced later this year, the company said. Deutsche Post (DPWGn.DE), the owner of DHL, quickly followed with its own planned express shipping price increases for 2014. A DHL spokesman declined to give details. FedEx’s express business has suffered recently as clients chose slower but cheaper delivery options. To combat that, the company revamped its routes, cutting capacity to Asia and other international markets. Analysts said FedEx’s plan for raising prices indicates the market is stabilizing after customers moved away from overnight delivery. The cutback in less profitable routes should help the overnight business remain profitable even at lower volumes, they said. “We’ve seen most of the shift (from express to cheaper options) happen at this point,” said Logan Purk, an industrials analyst for Edward Jones. Purk and S&P; Capital IQ equity analyst Jim Corridore both noted FedEx tends to come in at or above its profit forecasts. FedEx said on Wednesday it earned $489 million, or $1.53 a share for its first quarter that ended August 31. Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx beat Wall Street profit estimates by 3 cents on cost cuts and other price increases it implemented earlier. Its shares were up 2.7 percent, or about $3.24, at $113.93 in late morning New York Stock Exchange trading.

Cyber Monday is the Monday after Thanksgiving when employees return to offices and purchase items with their computers at work.

FedEx said categories like consumer electronics, apparel and luxury goods will be among the most shipped items, apart from e-commerce purchases. FedEx said it expects its busiest day ever on Dec. 2, which is Cyber Monday this year and expects to move more than 22 million shipments across the world. During that whole week, FedEx expects move more than 85 million shipments, a rise of 13 percent over last year. Shipment forecasts from companies like FedEx are considered a barometer of broader economic health because of the volume of goods they move.

188,FDX,"Third Point's Loeb owns FedEx stock, bullish on Japan: CNBC","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Activist investor Dan Loeb, founder of hedge fund Third Point LLC, said Tuesday that his investment firm owns shares of FedEx Corp (FDX.N) and remains bullish on Japan. Loeb, whose hedge fund oversees $13 billion, said in an interview at a Dealbook conference, shown on CNBC television, that he met with FedEx chief executive Fred Smith recently. Shares in FedEx were up 2.2 percent at $135.43 in morning trading following Loeb’s comments. Loeb reiterated his bullish views on the Japanese economy, adding that the hedge fund’s investment in Sony Corp (6758.T) had also been a bet on growth policies being pursued by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda. “We remain very bullish on Japan,” Loeb said. Loeb said that he has met twice with Sony Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai and that his firm has had a “very good relationship” with the company. He said the company will continue to benefit from the weakness in Japan’s yen currency. Loeb has been one of the most vocal hedge fund managers on opportunities to invest in Japan in the past year. He also said that his bet on nutritional supplements company Herbalife (HLF.N) was not an instance of “pumping and dumping” a stock. Loeb took a stake after hedge fund manager William Ackman said the company was a pyramid scheme and had a “short” bet against its shares. Loeb said those accusations were unfounded. Loeb, who said that he bought shares in Herbalife when they were trading at around $28 per share and wrote a letter to his investors that said he expected the stock to rise to between $55 and $70 per share, added that he sold his stake when shares touched $44 per share several weeks later. “That to us is a gift. We decided to take the money and run. So there was no pump and dump,” Loeb said.

192,FDX,FedEx second-quarter profit misses estimate; offers holiday optimism,"(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N) posted a 14 percent rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday on stronger margins and cost cuts, but results missed Wall Street estimates, which overshadowed the company’s confident forecast for the holiday shopping season. Wall Street analysts expressed disappointment at the slight dip in revenue at the express delivery business, FedEx’s biggest unit. They also noted softening volume growth for ground deliveries. Average daily volume at FedEx Ground rose 8 percent in the fiscal second quarter, slowing from the 11 and 10 percent growth in the previous two quarters, and below the 10 percent expected by Logan Purk, an analyst at Edward Jones. A 3 percent rise in overall revenue to $11.4 billion and success in ongoing cost cutting efforts helped offset some of the volume weakness. FedEx earned $500 million, or $1.57 a share, in the second quarter ended November 30, versus $438 million, or $1.39, in the same quarter last year. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of $1.64 as per Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of the global shipping company slid as much as 3 percent in premarket action. By mid-morning, the stock dipped 0.1 percent at $138.93 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Graphic on FedEx results: link.reuters.com/byn55v) FedEx predicted a strong holiday season and forecast full-year earnings per share growth between 8 percent and 14 percent above last year. Previously, its outlook was for growth between 7 percent and 13 percent. While part of that boot to earnings per share will be attributed to the company’s repurchase of 10 million shares year to date, FedEx has also said it expects shipping volumes to pick up during the holiday season. In October, the company forecast more than 85 million shipments during Cyber Monday week, up 13 percent from last year. On a conference call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf said seasonal increases in volume, revenue, and operating income related to cyber Monday week will come in the third quarter this year, not the second quarter as it was last year. “More than a quarter of the volume that we see in peak comes in Cyber Week. And if you think about it, that volume and revenue and profit was all shifted to the third quarter,” added FedEx Ground chief executive Henry Maier. Cyber Monday comes right after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday as employees return to work and many make purchases on their office computers.

193,FDX,REFILE-UPDATE 5-FedEx 2nd-qtr profit misses estimate; offers holiday optimism,"By Nivedita Bhattacharjee Dec 18 (Reuters) - FedEx Corp posted a 14 percent rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday on stronger margins and cost cuts, but results missed Wall Street estimates, which overshadowed the company’s confident forecast for the holiday shopping season. Wall Street analysts expressed disappointment at the slight dip in revenue at the express delivery business, FedEx’s biggest unit. They also noted softening volume growth for ground deliveries. Average daily volume at FedEx Ground rose 8 percent in the fiscal second quarter, slowing from the 11 and 10 percent growth in the previous two quarters, and below the 10 percent expected by Logan Purk, an analyst at Edward Jones. A 3 percent rise in overall revenue to $11.4 billion and success in ongoing cost cutting efforts helped offset some of the volume weakness. FedEx earned $500 million, or $1.57 a share, in the second quarter ended Nov. 30, versus $438 million, or $1.39, in the same quarter last year. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of $1.64 as per Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of the global shipping company slid as much as 3 percent in premarket action. By mid-morning, the stock dipped 0.1 percent at $138.93 on the New York Stock Exchange. FedEx predicted a strong holiday season and forecast full-year earnings per share growth between 8 percent and 14 percent above last year. Previously, its outlook was for growth between 7 percent and 13 percent. While part of that boot to earnings per share will be attributed to the company’s repurchase of 10 million shares year to date, FedEx has also said it expects shipping volumes to pick up during the holiday season. In October, the company forecast more than 85 million shipments during Cyber Monday week, up 13 percent from last year. On a conference call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf said seasonal increases in volume, revenue, and operating income related to cyber Monday week will come in the third quarter this year, not the second quarter as it was last year. “More than a quarter of the volume that we see in peak comes in Cyber Week. And if you think about it, that volume and revenue and profit was all shifted to the third quarter,” added FedEx Ground chief executive Henry Maier. Cyber Monday comes right after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday as employees return to work and many make purchases on their office computers.

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will follow the 2:00 p.m. EST (1900 GMT) announcement with his final press conference at the helm of the U.S. central bank at 2:30 p.m. Many expect the Fed to continue its quantitative easing program at the current pace of $85 billion monthly asset purchases into next year. Still, sturdier recent economic data led some to believe it is time to take the training wheels off the world’s largest economy and to allow it to progress on its own. Data on Wednesday showed U.S. housing starts surged to their highest in nearly six years in November, a sign of strength in the housing market that could support a Fed decision to soon start cutting back its bond purchases. “I don’t think the market should ignore these numbers as an indication the consumer is in decent shape,” said Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management in New York. “The reaction from the market is not too strong before the Fed, as nobody wants to take on a big position in the morning.” The stimulus has kept a lid on borrowing costs and flooded markets with liquidity, boosting an equities rally. The S&P; 500  closed at a record high on Dec. 9. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 61.62 points or 0.39 percent, to 15,936.88, the S&P; 500 gained 3.38 points or 0.19 percent, to 1,784.38 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 3.018 points or 0.08 percent, to 4,020.662. Apple and Micron weighed on the Nasdaq, with the iPhone maker down 1.5 percent at $546.73 and Micron off 7.5 percent at $21.20. Ford shares fell 5.4 percent to $15.80 after the carmaker said it expects North American pre-tax profit to be lower in 2014 than in 2013. FedEx Corp’s quarterly results missed Wall Street estimates as revenue declined at its biggest unit. Its shares edged down 0.4 percent to $138.50. CVS Caremark said it expects sales and earnings to rise in 2014 even though it anticipated only a “modest” benefit next year from the launch of the U.S. Affordable Care Act. Its shares jumped 3 percent to $68.82.

198,FDX,NYC sues FedEx for illegally shipping cigarettes to homes,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City has sued FedEx Corp, accusing it of illegally delivering millions of contraband cigarettes to people’s homes and seeking $52 million in fines and unpaid taxes. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, marks one of the last acts by the administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg, whose more than decade-old campaign to ban smoking in various public and private places has been credited with saving thousands of lives and become a blueprint for other cities. According to the city, package delivery company FedEx created a “public nuisance” through its partnership with Shinnecock Smoke Shop, located on the Shinnecock Indian Nation reservation in Southampton, New York, to ship untaxed cigarettes to residential homes. FedEx allegedly did so despite, and even while negotiating, a February 2006 agreement with New York State’s then attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, to stop such deliveries in the state, an agreement later expanded to cover deliveries throughout the country. The city said FedEx delivered about 19.5 tons, or 55,000 cartons, of cigarettes to city residents in 9,900 shipments from 2005 to 2012 and deprived it of a $15 excise tax on each carton. A typical carton has 200 cigarettes. FedEx’s activity violated various federal and state laws, including an anti-racketeering statute, the complaint said. The city wants FedEx to pay a $49.5 million fine, equal to $5,000 per shipment, plus $2.48 million representing triple the lost tax revenue. It also wants FedEx to hire an independent monitor to ensure future compliance and provide training. In a statement, Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx said it has stopped doing business with known shippers of untaxed cigarettes. “Through its contracts with customers, FedEx prohibits the shipment of tobacco direct to consumers and believes the claims made by the city are overstated and not founded in law,” it said. “FedEx intends to defend this case while continuing to work with authorities to stop prohibited tobacco shipments.” Eric Proshansky, deputy chief of the New York City Law Department’s affirmative litigation division, called the case “part of our comprehensive efforts to end the trafficking of contraband cigarettes into the city and to hold accountable any business that contributes to that illegal trade.” City and state officials have long fought in court to collect taxes on cigarettes sold by Indian-owned businesses. The Shinnecock Indian Nation did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither it nor the smoke shop are defendants in the lawsuit against FedEx. The lawsuit comes two days before New York Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio takes office, ending Bloomberg’s 12-year mayoralty. De Blasio has named Zachary Carter, the former U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, to succeed Michael Cardozo as corporation counsel, the city’s top lawyer. Cardozo filed the FedEx lawsuit.

202,FDX,"DHL, FedEx suspend shipments to Russian customers","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Express delivery companies DHL and FedEx (FDX.N) said on Thursday they had suspended foreign shipments to individual customers in Russia because of stricter customs procedures, making it harder for internet users to buy goods from abroad. President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign late last year to “put into order” a booming e-commerce sector. One of the proposed measures was lowering a value threshold for purchases in foreign online stores that are subject to customs duty. According to DHL Express, part of Deutsche Post (DPWGn.DE), Russian authorities from January 2014 expanded the list of documents required to ship goods to individual customers, which has significantly slowed customs clearance. DHL will suspend all shipments of goods for personal use to Russia from January 27, the company said in emailed comments, after already suspending most such imports already in 2010. A Moscow call-centre operator for FedEx said shipments to individual customers in Russia were “temporarily suspended”. The FedEx press office was not immediately available for comment. According to a draft letter to clients from Russia’s Association of Express Carriers, seen by Reuters, other providers such as UPS (UPS.N), TNT TNTE.AS, and DPD also decided to suspend imports. UPS said it had seen significant delays in delivery of packages to private individuals in Russia due to the additional customs procedures. TNT TNTE.AS and DPD could not be reached. Maxim Andryukhin, head of representation for Russia at Bay.ru, a company which helps Russians buy products from sites such as eBay (EBAY.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O), said the procedures meant it was now asking customers to provide more documents such as a scanned copy of their passports.

204,FDX,FedEx raises freight unit rates 3.9 percent,"(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N) said on Monday it will raise shipping rates at its freight business by 3.9 percent, effective March 31. The rate increase is for FedEx Freight shipments within the United States including Alaska and Hawaii, as well as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, Canada and within Mexico. The world’s second biggest parcel delivery company after United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), FedEx had last year raised rates by 3.9 percent for its domestic express shipping unit, effective Jan 6. The increase is smaller than last year’s, when FedEx increased freight rates by 4.5 percent, effective July. The freight segment contributes about 12 percent to FedEx’s overall revenue. Freight is a more competitive market than the ground and express businesses, where FedEx and UPS are the only two big players. “Freight operates in a more highly fragmented space with many competitors. This can lead to irrational pricing during tough markets, as other carriers will continue to bid down rates to maintain asset utilization,” analyst Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar said. Schoonmaker said he expects FedEx to raise rates regularly as the shipper covers inflating costs, and said increases in the range of 4-6 percent is “normal”. The FedEx Freight segment includes FedEx Freight, which is a provider of less-than-truckload freight services, FedEx Freight Canada and FedEx Custom Critical. Less than truckload is the shipping of relatively small loads of freight, and customers use this method because it costs less than hiring an entire truck for an exclusive shipment. While FedEx and UPS revise their shipping rates every year, the rate increase comes at a time when both companies have been trying to adjust to changes in shipping patterns, as many customers move towards cheaper shipping services, especially internationally. UPS said late last year the company planned to raise rates across the board on an average of 4.9 percent within and between the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico.

UPS said late last year the company planned to raise rates across the board on an average of 4.9 percent within and between the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. FedEx shares were trading down 0.3 percent at $132.90 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.

209,FDX,UPS raises freight unit shipping rates,"(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc said it will raise shipping rates at its freight unit by 4.4 percent, more than rival FedEx Corp did earlier this month. The new rates apply to non-contractual less-than-truckload shipments rated on the current UPS tariffs, the company said, and will come into effect March 31. Less than truckload is the shipping of relatively small loads of freight, and customers use this method because it costs less than hiring an entire truck for an exclusive shipment. On March 3 FedEx said it will raise shipping rates at its freight business by 3.9 percent, effective March 31. While FedEx and UPS revise their shipping rates every year, rate increases this time come while both companies have been trying to adjust to changes in shipping patterns, as many customers move towards cheaper shipping services, especially internationally. UPS shares were trading at $96.35 after the bell. They closed at $96.27 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.

211,FDX,Wall Street drops after Yellen moves up possible rate hike,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday after comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen raised the possibility of an earlier- than-anticipated increase in interest rates. The central bank dropped the U.S. unemployment rate as its definitive yardstick for gauging the economy’s strength and made clear it would rely on a wide range of measures in deciding when to raise interest rates. Equities extended declines after Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the “considerable period” between the end of its quantitative easing program, known as QE, and the first rate increase from the central bank could be six months. With QE forecast to wind down sometime near the end of the year, a six-month lag would move up the timetable for the Fed’s first hike, which many market participants had been expecting in the second half of 2015. “She certainly moved it up a little bit, and I don’t think the market was expecting that at all because she is widely viewed as being more on the dovish side of the aisle than she is on the hawkish side,” said Peter Kenny, CEO of Clearpool Group in New York. “That is not a particularly hawkish comment, but the fact of the matter is, it was not expected.” The Fed also said it would cut its monthly purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to $55 billion, from $65 billion. The S&P; 500 was within 1 percent of its record closing high, though economic bellwether FedEx Corp (FDX.N) hit a sour note in its outlook. Geopolitical concerns related to Ukraine also stayed in focus. FedEx posted results below expectations and gave a weak full-year profit forecast, but the package shipper said it had been significantly hurt by winter storms, and the stock slipped 0.1 percent to close at $138.38. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 114.02 points or 0.70 percent, to end at 16,222.17. The S&P; 500 .SPX slipped 11.48 points or 0.61 percent, to finish at 1,860.77. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 25.711 points or 0.59 percent, to close at 4,307.602. Equities had rallied to start the week, buoyed by easing geopolitical concerns, though trading volume has been light. The S&P; 500 .SPX has climbed 1.7 percent over the previous two days, the best back-to-back performance for the benchmark index since early February. First Solar Inc (FSLR.O) surged 20.6 percent to $69.40 and ranked as the S&P; 500’s best performer after the company forecast a rise of up to 21 percent in revenue this year. First Solar also said it was developing cost-effective solar plants with General Electric Co (GE.N). Volume was light, with about 6 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.7 billion average so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets. Volume is expected to surge on Friday as options expiration takes place alongside multiple index rebalances. Credit Suisse estimates $14 billion in gross trading will stem from the S&P; 500 index rebalance, with another $6 billion coming from rebalancing in other indexes. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the New York Stock Exchange by a ratio of 3 to 1. On the Nasdaq, nearly two stocks fell for every one that rose.

213,FDX,"REFILE-UPDATE 3-Winter storms hit FedEx's quarterly results, outlook","(Removes extraneous “‘s” after FedEx Corp in first paragraph) By Nivedita Bhattacharjee March 19 (Reuters) - FedEx Corp on Wednesday said severe winter conditions had hurt quarterly earnings and revenue, prompting the world’s No. 2 package delivery company to cut its fiscal-year profit forecast. The unusual weather disrupted operations, reduced shipping volumes and increased costs, decreasing operating income by about $125 million in the third quarter ended on Feb. 28, FedEx said. But the company also said it was on track with its plan to improve earnings at the FedEx Express air delivery unit by $1.6 billion by the end of 2016. FedEx reported earnings of $378 million, or $1.23 a share, compared with $361 million, or $1.13 a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting $1.45 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 3 percent to $11.3 billion, missing forecasts of $11.43 billion. The company said it expected to earn $6.55 to $6.80 a share for the year, down from its earlier outlook of $6.73 to $7.10. Analysts had forecast $6.89. While analysts expected weather conditions to hurt FedEx, it was difficult to estimate the financial impact without interim data, said Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker. Shares of FedEx were down 0.4 percent at $137.99 in afternoon trading. “While we were disappointed with the third-quarter earnings miss, the shortfall was due to weather-related costs,” Deutsche Bank analyst Justin Yagerman wrote in a note to clients. “FedEx remains one of our favorite ways to benefit from an improving economy.” FedEx’s numbers provide the first real look at the impact the brutal winter had on the shipping industry. Temperatures across a vast area of the United States, from the Great Plains through the Midwest and into the northern Appalachians, ran 6 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (3.3 to 5.5 degrees Celsius) below normal for 2-1/2 months straight. Companies across the board have been talking about how the weather hurt their quarterly results. McDonald’s Corp  partly blamed a fall in January sales at its established U.S. restaurants on the frigid cold and snow, while vitamin and nutritional supplements retailer GNC Holdings Inc warned that its first-quarter results would miss expectations for that reason. Ford Motor Co, railroad operator CSX Corp and air carrier United Continental Holdings Inc have also said the weather was affecting operations in the first quarter. During the third quarter, FedEx entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to buy back an aggregate of $2.0 billion of common stock. The third-quarter results benefited from Cyber Week, a heavy online shopping period that had fallen in the second quarter last year, as well as from one additional operating day, the company said. However, problems stemming from the harsh winter overshadowed those benefits. Apart from bad weather, FedEx, like bigger rival United Parcel Service Inc, was also hit by an unprecedented surge in online holiday shipping volumes. Typically, a rise in online sales is good news for companies like these because it means more demand for their services. But this time, UPS said it had been overwhelmed by the volume of holiday packages. The arrival of Christmas presents around the globe was delayed, and angry customers took to social websites to complain. However, on a conference call with analysts, FedEx Chief Executive Officer Frederick Smith said the company was able to handle a rise in volumes and that social media might have blown the problems out of proportion. “We live in a world where Twitter and social media makes anecdotes,” Smith said. “That was the big difference.” While an increase in e-commerce was helpful to FedEx, he said, many shippers did not have the ability to handle last-minute orders, which added to the holiday delivery congestion. Many industry experts think shoppers are more comfortable with making online purchases at the last minute because large online retailers like Amazon.com Inc can deliver the orders in one or two days. Not all retailers have the necessary infrastructure to do that, however, so courier companies saw a huge rise in last-minute shipping volumes. In the third quarter, average daily volume at FedEx’s ground unit rose 8 percent.

That will be followed by Yellen’s first news conference as chair. * The Fed is not expected to deviate from its policy path so far, and analysts said a further reduction in the central bank’s stimulative bond-buying program was largely priced into markets. Still, as the Fed’s stimulus has kept a floor under equity prices, market participants will be attuned to any comments on the speed of future cuts, as well as how soon interest rates might be raised. * S&P; 500 futures rose 2.9 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract.

216,FDX,New York state joins New York City in suing FedEx over untaxed cigarettes,"(Reuters) - New York state joined New York City in suing FedEx Corp for allegedly violating state and federal laws by delivering untaxed cigarettes, but the company said customer privacy prevented it from checking packages without reason. New York City accused FedEx of creating a “public nuisance” through its partnership with Shinnecock Smoke Shop to ship untaxed cigarettes to homes. An amended complaint filed on Sunday included New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman among the plaintiffs seeking more than $239 million in damages and penalties. ""Not only has FedEx cheated the state out of millions in tax dollars - but many of these cigarettes may have ended up in the hands of teenagers, who are particularly vulnerable to low-priced cigarettes,"" Schneiderman said in a statement. (r.reuters.com/hex97v) New York state alleged that FedEx knowingly shipped nearly 400,000 cartons of unstamped cigarettes to homes in the state, depriving it of $15, $27.50 or $43.50 on each carton in tax revenue. FedEx said the case lacked legal foundation. The company said it had to protect the privacy of customers and would not open packages to determine their contents without reason. “While the lawsuit identifies several shippers of untaxed cigarettes with which we stopped doing business, those shippers are not being sued in the case, nor are any recipients who evaded paying applicable taxes,” FedEx spokesman Perry Colosimo said in a statement emailed to Reuters. New York City had alleged in December that the company deprived it of excise tax of $15 per carton. “The claims advanced in the amended complaint by the NYAG are substantively identical to the City’s claims in the original complaint,” Assistant Corporation Counsel Eric Proshansky, who represents New York City in the case, said in a letter on Sunday. “Accordingly, the proposed objections to the pleadings raised by FXG (FedEx Ground Package) should still form the basis for discussion at the April 9th pre-motion conference.” FedEx requested the court last week to dismiss or substantially narrow New York City’s complaint.

219,FDX,UPDATE 1-Investigators focus on cause of deadly California crash,"(Adds NTSB saying bus tracking module likely destroyed, paragraphs 12-16) By Sharon Bernstein SACRAMENTO, Calif., April 12 (Reuters) - Investigators were focusing on Saturday on what caused a FedEx tractor-trailer to collide with a bus in a fiery crash in northern California that killed 10 people, five of them teenage students en route to a college recruitment event. It remained unclear whether the FedEx driver was somehow distracted or lost consciousness, or whether a mechanical failure occurred when his truck swerved across the median of Interstate 5 and slammed head-on into the motor coach full of students from the Los Angeles area on Thursday evening. The California Highway Patrol also raised the possibility that a separate collision on the truck’s side of the highway might have been a factor. Early highway patrol accounts of the accident said the truck side-swiped a car after crossing the center divider, before hitting the bus. Two witnesses, Bonnie and Joe Duran, who were reported to be in the clipped car, told California media outlets that the truck was on fire before the collision. “I was heading along in the outside lane and I looked over and saw the FedEx truck coming straight for me and he was in flames already,” Bonnie Duran told a local CBS television affiliate. Reuters could not immediately contact the Durans and a California Highway Patrol spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A powerful explosion unleashed by the impact was heard throughout the nearby community of Orland, about 90 miles (145 km) north of Sacramento, said Glenn County Sheriff Larry Jones. Among the dead were the two drivers, as well as five high school students and a college recruiter on their way north to visit Humboldt State University in Arcata, California, as part of a program to help disadvantaged college hopefuls. More than 30 others were injured in the wreck. “We don’t know whether the FedEx driver had fallen asleep, whether he experienced a mechanical failure with his vehicle or whether there was a separate collision on the southbound side that caused him to lose control,” said Lieutenant Scott Fredrick, the lead Highway Patrol investigator. A team of investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board are likely to remain on-site for about two weeks for the board’s independent review of the accident. Most of the FedEx truck, which was hauling two semi-trailers, was consumed in the fire, Mark Rosekind, an NTSB investigator, said at a briefing late on Friday. But, he added, there were sufficient remains of both drivers for authorities to have collected samples for blood and toxicology analysis. “So right now, one of the things we’re in the process of doing is seeing whether or not those required samples were actually collected,” he added. The fire was so intense that it could be days or weeks before some of the bodies can be identified, and investigators will have to rely on dental records or in some cases DNA testing, he said. On Saturday, an NTSB spokesman said there was a chance that the fire destroyed any electronic tracking modules on the bus that would have recorded the speed and braking. The stricken motor coach was one of three buses of students traveling from Southern California to participate in a spring break recruitment program at Humboldt State. The two other buses had arrived safely at the campus before the third bus crashed. Nestled near the redwoods about 100 miles (161 km) south of the Oregon border, the university every year invites high school seniors from disadvantaged backgrounds or who may be the first in their families to attend college to tour the campus. The Los Angeles Unified School District, the largest in Southern California, said some of the 19 students from its high schools who were on the tour rode on the ill-fated bus, but it could not say whether any of them were among the victims. Apart from the driver, the bus was carrying 44 to 48 students and several chaperones, highway patrol spokeswoman Lacey Heitman said. About 34 people were taken by air and land ambulances to hospitals with a variety of injuries, police said. Among those killed was Humboldt State recruiter Arthur Arzola, 26, who worked for the university out of the Southern California community of Rancho Cucamonga. A recently engaged couple serving as chaperones were also among the dead, local media reported. Jonathan Gutierrez, 17, told NBC’s “Today” show that after the crash the bus filled with smoke and students broke windows to escape. “It was a very surreal moment,” he said. “All of a sudden I heard people screaming,” said Gutierrez, who had been asleep before the impact. Pictures from the scene showed the bus reduced to a burned-out chassis resting sideways across the highway. Yellow tarps were draped over what appeared to be bodies in the wreckage.

He said the NTSB probe would examine human factors as well as “the machine and the environment,” including highway design elements, vehicle inspection records and driver training and medical records. The FedEx truck, which was hauling two semi-trailers, was mostly consumed in the fire that followed the crash, but Rosekind said there were sufficient remains of both drivers for authorities to have collected samples for blood and toxicology analysis. “So right now, one of the things we’re in the process of doing is seeing whether or not those required samples were actually collected,” he added. The fire was so intense that it could be days or weeks before some of the bodies can be identified, and investigators will have to rely on dental records or in some cases DNA testing, he said. The stricken motor coach was one of three buses of students traveling from Southern California to participate in a spring break recruitment program at Humboldt State. The two other buses had arrived safely at the campus before the third bus crashed, Rosekind said. Nestled near the redwoods about 100 miles (161 km) south of the Oregon border, the university every year invites high school seniors from disadvantaged backgrounds or who may be the first in their families to attend college to tour the campus. The Los Angeles Unified School District, the largest in Southern California, said some of the 19 students from its high schools who were on the tour rode on the ill-fated bus, but it could not say whether any of them were among the victims. Apart from the driver, the bus was carrying 44 to 48 students and several chaperones, highway patrol spokeswoman Lacey Heitman said. About 34 people were taken by air and land ambulances to hospitals with a variety of injuries, police said. “They are traumatized, absolutely,” another patrol  spokeswoman, Tracy Hoover, said. “Most of them have scratches, cuts, burns, contusions and lacerations.” Among those killed was Humboldt State recruiter Arthur Arzola, 26, who worked for the university out of the Southern California community of Rancho Cucamonga, the Sacramento County coroner said on Friday morning. The school’s website describes Arzola as a counselor and recruiter. In a biography on the site, Arzola characterized himself as hard-working, compassionate and friendly, and described the university as offering “incredible opportunities that change the world for the better.” A recently engaged couple serving as chaperones were also among the dead, local media reported. Jonathan Gutierrez, 17, told NBC’s “Today” show that after the crash the bus filled with smoke and students broke windows to escape. “It was a very surreal moment,” he said. “All of a sudden I heard people screaming,” said Gutierrez, who had been asleep before the impact. Pictures from the scene showed the bus reduced to a burned-out chassis resting sideways across the highway. Yellow tarps were draped over what appeared to be bodies in the wreckage. “The big rig and the bus were both engulfed in flames. You are talking about two vehicles that are destroyed. There is hardly anything left of the truck,” Hoover said. Bonnie Kourvelas, a spokeswoman for FedEx Corp, said the company was aware that one of its trucks was involved in the crash and is “cooperating fully with authorities.” Humboldt State President Rollin Richmond said the students were to attend a spring preview event on Friday. “Our hearts go out to those who have been affected, and we are here to support them, and their families, in any way possible,” he said in a written statement.

222,FDX,UPDATE 2-Truck in deadly California crash on fire before collision - witness,"(Recasts with truck ablaze at impact, adds detail) By Sharon Bernstein SACRAMENTO, Calif., April 12 (Reuters) - A witness reported that a FedEx tractor-trailer that crashed into a bus in northern California on Thursday killing 10 people was on fire before impact, the National Transportation Safety Board said on Saturday. The driver of a car that had passed the bus just before the crash said flames were coming from beneath the cab of the truck, board member Mark Rosekind told a Saturday evening news conference. The truck clipped the car and then hit the bus, Rosekind said. Among those killed were five teen-aged students en route to a college recruitment event, along with the drivers of the bus and truck. Some of the dead were ejected from the bus, he said. The crash happened on Interstate 5, about 90 miles (145 km) north of the state capital, Sacramento. The students were from the Los Angeles area. The truck left a southbound lane at a 10-degree angle, crossed a 58-foot median into a northbound lane, hit a Nissan Altima and then struck the bus which was behind the Nissan, Rosekind said. There were no barriers in the median, he said. “There is no indication of tire marks from braking in the median or in the northbound lane,” Rosekind said. The driver of the Nissan said flames were coming from under the truck’s cab, although her passenger did not see the flames, Rosekind said. He did not identify the driver or passenger, but they were interviewed by California news media and Bonnie and Joe Duran said the truck was on fire before the collision. “I was heading along in the outside lane and I looked over and saw the FedEx truck coming straight for me, and he was in flames already,” Bonnie Duran told a CBS television affiliate. The preliminary investigation showed that the bus driver  swerved to the right in an attempt to avoid the crash. “There was clearly reaction on the part of the bus driver,” Rosekind said, adding “We can differentiate that from the truck driver, where we see no (skid) marks.” Blood samples from the two drivers would be tested for alcohol, medication or illegal drugs, Rosekind said. “We don’t know whether the FedEx driver had fallen asleep, whether he experienced a mechanical failure with his vehicle or whether there was a separate collision on the southbound side that caused him to lose control,” said Lieutenant Scott Fredrick, the lead California Highway Patrol investigator. CHP also raised the possibility that a separate collision on the truck’s side of the road could have been a factor. A powerful explosion from the impact was heard throughout  nearby Orlando, Glenn County Sheriff Larry Jones said. The five students and a college recruiter who were killed were on their way to visit Humboldt State University in Arcata, California, as part of a program to help disadvantaged college hopefuls. More than 30 were injured. A team of investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board are likely to remain on-site for about two weeks for an independent review of the accident. Most of the FedEx truck, which was hauling two semi-trailers, was consumed in the fire, Rosekind said earlier. The fire was so intense it could take days or weeks before some of the bodies can be identified. Investigators will have to rely on dental records or in some cases DNA testing, he said. An NTSB spokesman also said there was a chance that the fire destroyed any electronic tracking modules on the bus which would have recorded the speed and braking. The stricken motor coach was one of three buses of students traveling from Southern California to participate in a spring break recruitment program. The two other buses had arrived safely at the campus before the crash. Nestled near the redwoods about 100 miles (160 kms) south of the Oregon border, the university every year invites high school seniors from disadvantaged backgrounds or who may be the first in their families to attend college to tour the campus.

223,FDX,'No evidence' of pre-collision fire in deadly California crash: NTSB,"(Reuters) - An investigation into the northern California crash between a FedEx truck and bus that killed 10 people last week has turned up “no evidence” of a pre-collision fire, contrary to a witness report, authorities said on Sunday. A witness in a car the truck clipped before crashing into the bus reported flames shooting from underneath the truck’s cab before the fatal collision. Further investigation found no evidence of that, said Mark Rosekind, a National Transportation Safety Board member. “There is no evidence of pre-impact fire located at the accident scene, on the median or on the highway,” Rosekind told a news conference. “This is all preliminary, factual information. Nothing is ruled out yet.” Among the dead were the drivers of the truck and the bus, and five teenage students and a college recruiter going to an event at Humboldt State University in Arcata, California, as part of a program to help disadvantaged college hopefuls. More than 30 others were injured in the crash Thursday evening on Interstate 5 about 90 miles north of Sacramento. The students were from the Los Angeles area. At least one of the injured, a female patient, was listed in critical condition Sunday at the UC Davis Medial Center where another patient had died earlier, a hospital spokeswoman said. Rosekind said the truck left a southbound lane, crossed a 58-foot (18-meter) median into a northbound lane, hit a Nissan Altima and then struck the bus which was behind the car. There were no barriers in the median, he said. Glenn County Sheriff Larry Jones had said previously that a powerful explosion unleashed by the impact was so loud it was heard throughout the nearby community of Orland. The fire consumed the truck and the bus and was so intense that it could be days or weeks before some of the bodies can be identified, and investigators will have to rely on dental records or in some cases DNA testing, the NTSB has said. Rosekind said the NTSB planned to release a preliminary report on the crash in 30 days.

224,FDX,Neighbors rushed in vain to help in California bus crash that killed 10,"ORLAND, California (Reuters) - Newly released recordings of 911 emergency calls revealed the helplessness of stunned residents in the California town of Orland who witnessed the aftermath of last week’s fiery crash between a FedEx truck and a tour bus that killed 10 people. The California Highway Patrol made the recordings public on Thursday as investigators returned to the scene of the accident, painstakingly driving a pristine white tour bus back and forth over the charred and bubbled surface of Interstate 5 in an effort to reconstruct the April 10 collision. “Whatever is on the freeway is on fire,” a man is heard telling emergency dispatchers on one of the recordings. “I just heard an explosion, but now I hear sirens. I’m running over to see what it is.” Five high school students and five adults, including the two drivers, died when the FedEx tractor trailer swerved across the highway median and slammed head-on into a motor coach filled with about 50 Los Angeles-area teenagers on their way to visit Humboldt State University in Arcata, California. A blast unleashed by the impact was so loud that it was heard throughout nearby Orland, an agricultural community about 90 miles north of Sacramento. Authorities said Thursday they still have not determined what caused the freight truck to careen through the tall, thick bushes growing along the center of the divided interstate and plow directly into the path of the motor coach. In an audio replay of the experiences neighbors recounted from the moments after the crash, 911 operators can be heard telling the callers to stay away from the scene, and that emergency personnel were already arriving. Carla Lopez, 17, and her mother live just a few feet away from the highway in a neighborhood of modest houses so close to the accident site that some residents fretted that one of the vehicles could have come flying off the road into their homes. On Thursday, they clung to each other next to a makeshift memorial by the side of the interstate, watching Highway Patrol drivers maneuver a borrowed bus and FedEx tractor-trailer back and forth along the road. On the clear, sunny afternoon last week when the collision occurred, the family heard a noise and ran outside, the teenager recalled. “We couldn’t help because the bus kept exploding,” Lopez said quietly. “So we couldn’t get near it.” The scene was all fire and pandemonium, said Glenn County Sheriff Larry Jones. “People don’t realize how easily it could have been everyone on that bus who died,” Jones said. “They were on fire. The girls’ hair was on fire.” Had it not been for the relative youth and flexibility of the passengers, and for two students who managed to kick out the windows of the bus, everyone aboard the bus might have perished, Jones said. “If this had been a bus full of older people headed to the casinos or something, they would have all died,” he said. “It’s just by the grace of God that we have these survivors.” At a news conference at the crash site on Thursday, officials said it could be months before they know what caused the crash. Investigators trying to determine the presumed speed of the colliding vehicles slowed traffic on the interstate - the main West Coast highway from San Diego to Washington state - running a stand-in bus and truck past each other repeatedly, and taking measurements. Another test checked how far the bus would skid if the brakes were applied at highway speeds. Nearby, three small memorials shone in the bright sunlight of the hot Sacramento Valley afternoon. One consisted of a single red flower, planted in a square of orange emergency tape out on the highway where workers had hauled away the last of the debris from the crash earlier Thursday morning. The largest, pressed up against a chain-link fence erected to keep pedestrians off of the freeway, featured a cross made of yellow blossoms, vases of red, purple and vanilla-colored flowers and 35 religious candles. Above these hung posters, some signed by relatives of the dead and others by residents of Orland. A palette of paints with brushes attached was taped on to the poster, in memory of a teenaged artist among the victims. “To my dear cousin,” someone had written on the poster, “It was early for you to go.” ",4182014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-california-crash/neighbors-rushed-in-vain-to-help-in-california-bus-crash-that-killed-10-idUSBREA3H03O20140418

227,FDX,"Six hurt, suspect dead in Georgia FedEx facility shooting","KENNESAW, Georgia (Reuters) - A FedEx Corp package handler armed with a shotgun opened fire at a shipping facility in suburban Atlanta early on Tuesday, injuring six people before killing himself, apparently with his own weapon, police and hospital officials said. Three people were in critical condition, two of them with life-threatening injuries, after being shot by the 19-year-old gunman just before 6 a.m. EDT at a FedEx warehouse near the airport in Kennesaw, Georgia, about 30 miles northwest of Atlanta, police and hospital officials said.

232,FDX,FedEx Freight to raise fuel surcharge by 3 pct in June,"May 2 (Reuters) - FedEx Corp, the world’s second largest parcel delivery company, said FedEx Freight would raise fuel surcharge by 3 percent next month, aiming to offset an increase in costs from rising fuel prices. The company also said FedEx Ground would start applying dimensional weight pricing to all shipments from January next year. Dimensional weight pricing is currently applied only to packages measuring three cubic feet or greater. “They are raising their fuel recovery. It will increase the cost to shippers,” said David Vernon, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein. The move comes after FedEx reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and cut its full-year forecast in March due to higher costs related to rising fuel prices and the winter storms in the United States. Fuel costs at FedEx Freight rose 3 percent in the third quarter ended Feb. 28. The business contributed about 12 percent to the company’s total revenue in the quarter. Both FedEx and larger rival UPS raised shipping rates for their freight units in March. Freight is a more competitive than the ground and express businesses, where FedEx and UPS are the only two big players. The FedEx Freight business includes FedEx Freight Canada, FedEx Custom Critical and FedEx Freight, which is a provider of less-than-truckload freight services. Less-than-truckload is the shipping of relatively small loads of freight, and customers use this method because it costs less than hiring an entire truck for an exclusive shipment. FedEx Ground ships small packages throughout the United States and Canada and also delivers low-weight packages through a partnership with the U.S. Postal Service.

233,FDX,Crane spreads wings to lead in Memphis,"(Reuters) - American Ben Crane defied recent poor form to post a bogey-free seven-under 63 and surge to a two-shot lead in a weather-affected first round of the FedEx St. Jude Classic in Memphis on Thursday. Crane, a four-time winner on the U.S. tour but without a title since 2011, sits alone as the clubhouse leader after darkness halted play with 60 players still to complete their rounds due to an earlier storm delay. Fellow Americans Peter Malnati (65) and Billy Horschel, five-under through 16 holes, shared second at five-under. Major winners Retief Goosen (66) and Zach Johnson (15 holes) were joined by Joe Durant (66), Jason Bohn (14 holes) and Australian Stuart Appleby (17 holes) in a tie for fourth at four-under. Phil Mickelson, a runner-up last year, started his tune-up for the U.S. Open with a solid 67, leaving him in a tie for ninth. Playing the back nine of TPC Southwind first, Crane started modestly with birdies on the 11th and 16th holes before making his move at the turn. Three birdies on the trot to start the front side and two to finish sent the 38-year-old to the top of the pile, unfamiliar ground for Crane in recent times. Since a tie for ninth at the Humana Challenge in January, Crane hasn’t finished better than a tie for 32nd and missed five of his last seven cuts leading in. Malnati, a 26-year-old rookie coming off the secondary web.com tour, was another surprise packet given he has missed the cut on eight of his 11 appearances on tour this year. His 65 equaled his career low on tour and was his first round in the 60s since early March in Puerto Rico. “There have been some negative thoughts bouncing around in my head for most of the year but in the last couple of weeks I’ve kind of gotten it turned around,” said the Tennessee resident, who sits 172nd on the FedEx Cup points list. “I expected to come out and play well so it was great. I am really trying hard to really think about just playing golf and having fun. Mickelson, who will attempt to complete the career grand slam in the U.S. Open next week was treading water at one-over through 11 holes before making birdies on four of his last seven to push right into the mix.

The benchmark S&P; 500 set intraday and closing record highs while the CBOE Volatility Index or the VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell to its lowest since February 2007. “It’s onwards and upwards for equities, especially after the Fed’s announcements today,” said Mike Arone, chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors’ intermediary business in Boston. “There is an improved labor environment and inflation that is still below what the Fed considers a normal level,” Arone said. “I think that environment shapes up very well for risk assets and equities in particular.” After a two-day policy meeting, the U.S. central bank slashed its forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to a range of between 2.1 percent and 2.3 percent from an earlier projection of around 2.9 percent. But the Fed’s forecasts for 2015 and 2016 were unchanged, and it expressed confidence that the recovery was on track. “Economic activity is rebounding in the current quarter and will continue to expand at a moderate pace,” Fed Chair Janet Yellen told a news conference. “The economy is continuing to make progress towards our objectives” of full employment and 2 percent inflation. As widely expected, the Fed pushed ahead with plans to wind down one of its main stimulus programs, reducing its monthly bond purchases to $35 billion from $45 billion. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.13 points or 0.58 percent, to end at 16,906.62. The S&P; 500 gained 14.99 points or 0.77 percent, to 1,956.98, a record closing high. The Nasdaq Composite added 25.60 points or 0.59 percent, to 4,362.84. Wednesday’s advance pushed the S&P; 500 above its previous record closing high of 1,951.27, which was set on June 9. The S&P; 500 index has gained 1.1 percent for the week as investors largely shrugged off mounting tensions in Iraq and focused on a flurry of merger and acquisition activity as well as on better-than-anticipated manufacturing data. The VIX slid 12 percent to close at 10.61, its lowest in more than seven years. Part of the drop was because of options contract expirations on Friday. Among the biggest gainers was FedEx Corp, which rose 6.2 percent to $148.95 after hitting an all-time intraday high of $149.34. The world’s No. 2 package delivery company reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue. The stock’s gain helped push the Dow Jones Transportation Average up 1.5 percent. Amazon.com Inc shares jumped 2.7 percent to $334.38 after Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos unveiled a “Fire” smartphone with free, unlimited photo storage, jumping into a crowded field dominated by Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics. Adobe Systems shares shot up 8.2 percent to $73.08. Adobe was the S&P; 500’s best performer a day after the maker of Photoshop and Acrobat software reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue.

237,FDX,"Online shopping boosts FedEx's profit, shares hit life high","(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit as strong shipments of items ordered online boosted the ground business of world’s No. 2 parcel delivery company. FedEx said results in 2015 would also benefit from the restructuring of its express business, its largest by revenue, and it forecast full-year earnings that were better than many analysts and investors had expected. The company’s shares rose as much as 5.4 percent to a life high of $147.89 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. “Forward earnings estimates across the Street (had) declined, as many were somewhat cautious on the quarter...,” Cowen & Co analyst Helane Becker wrote in a note to clients. The company, like larger rival United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), has been cutting costs to offset rising fuel prices. The Memphis-based company is also restructuring its Express business, which has suffered as clients choose slower but cheaper delivery options, by revamping its routes and cutting capacity to Asia and other international markets. “Ground and Freight are performing well and Express remains on track to achieve its profit improvement plan despite the fuel headwinds we’ve experienced,” Chief Executive Fred Smith said on a post-earnings call. Revenue from FedEx’s ground business, which accounts for a quarter of the company’s total revenue, rose 8 percent to $3.01 billion in the fourth quarter ended May 31. U.S. online retail sales are expected to increase to about $300 billion in 2014 from $260 billion last year, according to John Yozzo, managing director of FTI Consulting Inc’s (FTI.N) Corporate Finance/Restructuring business. FedEx said last month it would start charging for all ground shipments by parcel size, in addition to weight, to reduce costs. UPS followed suit with a similar announcement on Tuesday in the face of rising oil prices amid concerns that escalating violence in Iraq could disrupt supplies. The new pricing will allow the logistics giants to charge more for items that are bulky, but not necessarily heavy, such as diapers and large soft toys. That will add to shipping costs for online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and eBay Inc (EBAY.O). FedEx forecast 2015 earnings of $8.50 to $9.00 per share. Analysts expect $8.75, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. If FedEx meets the high end of its forecast, it would beat or be in line with the expectations of 22 out of the 29 analysts covering the company, according to Thomson Reuters data.         Total revenue in the quarter rose 3.5 percent to $11.8 billion. Analysts had expected $11.66 billion.  The company reported earnings of $2.46 per share, well above the average analyst estimate of $2.36 per share. FedEx said capital expenditure would rise about 2 percent to $4.2 billion in 2015. The increase is largely due to aircraft deliveries to support the company’s fleet modernization program and for expansion of its ground network.

242,FDX,Texas mass murder suspect collapses in court as crime recounted,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - The man accused of killing six members of his former wife’s family, including four children, at their suburban Houston home collapsed in court on Friday when details of the crime were read aloud and was wheeled out in an office chair by sheriff’s deputies. Ronald Lee Haskell, 33, was in court wearing orange prison attire for a hearing after being charged on Thursday with capital murder in the shooting deaths of his former wife’s sister, her husband and four of their children, aged 4 to 14. He was being held without bond. Police have said Haskell entered the home on Wednesday posing as a delivery man and searching for his former wife, then methodically executed members of the family. Doug Durham, Haskell’s public defender, said his client had been in and out of hospitals in Utah and California with a history of mental illness and that he was not taking prescribed medication at the time of the killings.     He was expected to face a hearing on his mental capacity. A grand jury will decide whether he will be tried for capital murder, which carries the possibility of the death penalty. Haskell said “Yes, sir” to the judge after his rights were read and then fainted to the floor as details of the crime were read in court by the prosecutor. Sheriff’s deputies picked him up and wheeled him out of the courtroom in an office chair. Haskell is accused of fatally shooting two boys ages 4 and 14, two girls ages 7 and 9, and their parents Stephen Stay, 39, and Katie Stay, 33. Five of them were dead when found and one of the children died after being air-lifted to a hospital. Cassidy Stay, 15, survived a gunshot wound to the head. Cassidy was released from the hospital earlier on Friday and is expected to make a full recovery, the hospital said. Harris County prosecutor Tammy Thomas told the judge that Haskell methodically executed the family, tying them up and then firing two bullets into each of them, starting with the mother. Haskell, pretending to be a FedEx delivery man, entered the home when Cassidy told him to wait while she got a pen to take down his name and number, Thomas said. The teenager did not recognize her uncle, who had grown a beard in recent months, until after Haskell told her his name, Thomas said. He then pulled a gun and ordered her to assemble the other children in the living room before tying them up as they lay on the floor, Thomas added.  Their parents were confronted by Haskell when they returned from a trip to the bank, according to the prosecution.  When the family was together in one room, Haskell began to shoot them in a brazen attack that showed elements of planning, said Thomas, who appeared distraught after reading details of the crime to the court. “Maybe reality is finally settling in,” she told reporters afterward when asked what prompted Haskell to collapse.  “It makes no difference to me if he understands how much trouble he is in. We’ll get a jury to do that for him.” A neighbor previously told Reuters that Haskell was angry with the family for facilitating the divorce from his former wife, who did not live at the house and was not harmed in the incident.    Cassidy Stay, left for dead, called police and alerted them to the shootings and said that Haskell was going to the home of more relatives. Police intercepted him before he arrived. Police in San Marcos, California, have said they suspect Haskell bound his mother to a chair during an argument last week. Police in Logan, Utah, have said they once arrested Haskell for domestic violence when he lived there with his then-wife from 2006 to 2013, but charges were dropped in a plea deal.

243,FDX,UPDATE 1-Royal Mail given notice of French competition investigation,"* Authorities investigating French parcel delivery business * Could be fined 10 pct of turnover -analysts * Probe is part of wider industry investigation * French operations of FedEX and TNT Express also contacted   (Adds details) By Neil Maidment LONDON, July 16 (Reuters) - Britain’s Royal Mail has received notice from French competition authorities over a possible breach of antitrust law by one of its subsidiaries, which could result in a fine for the recently privatised group. Royal Mail said on Wednesday that it had received a notice regarding an issue with the French arm of its GLS business, one of Europe’s largest ground-based parcel delivery services. “We are currently considering the notice received from the French regulator,” it said. “Given the early stage of this matter, we cannot yet determine the amount or range of potential loss; however, it is possible that it could be material.” The company did not provide further specific details but said the matter was part of broader competition investigations in France. The French regulator declined to comment. Royal Mail shares were down 1.8 percent at 480 pence in early trading. Both FedEX Corp, the world’s No.2 parcel delivery group, and Dutch logistics company TNT Express have also released similar notice statements about their businesses in France. FedEx said that French authorities were investigating anticompetitive behaviour that is alleged to have occurred “primarily during trade association meetings” involving general managers of Tatex, which became FedEx Express France after the American company bought the business in July 2012. TNT Express said it had cooperated with the investigation since it started in 2010. Analysts at Espirito Santo said any fine would be relatively insignificant for Royal Mail but would represent worse news for TNT Express. “French antitrust law permits a maximum fine of 10 percent of worldwide turnover,” Espirito analysts said in a note. “This would lead to a worst-case scenario of around a 160 million pound ($274 million) fine for Royal Mail (10 percent of GLS revenue) and about a 670 million euro ($908 million) fine for TNT Express (group revenue of 6.7 billion euros). GLS contributed about 17 percent of Royal Mail’s 9.45 billion pound revenue for the year to March 30. The GLS network covers 37 countries but its main markets are Germany, Italy and France, which account for 70 percent of sales. Royal Mail is in the middle of a turnaround programme in France, where its business made an operating loss of 27 million euros in its previous financial year. The group has exited its overnight courier service and is focusing on two to three-day parcel deliveries rather than an express service.

The 15-count indictment, handed down by a federal grand jury in San Francisco, includes charges for conspiracy to distribute controlled substances.  In a statement, FedEx Senior Vice President Patrick Fitzgerald said the company is innocent and will plead not guilty. “FedEx transports more than 10 million packages a day,” Fitzgerald said. “The privacy of our customers is essential to the core of our business.

In one instance, FedEx knew the Drug Enforcement Administration shut down one pharmacy, but continued to ship packages from its affiliates. FedEx’s Fitzgerald said U.S. prosecutors are asking that the company assume responsibility for the legality of millions of packages a day.  “We are a transportation company.

253,FDX,"UPS, Fedex get approval for express services in more Chinese cities","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - After years of waiting, United Parcel Service Inc (UPS) (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) have received licenses in China to extend domestic express package services to Beijing and other cities without needing joint-venture partners. The U.S. companies had been waiting for permission to independently courier packages from businesses to consumers (B2C) via their entire Chinese networks, since a 2009 postal law largely restricted foreign firms to delivering packages from abroad. The licenses increase access to a market second in size only to the United States. Thanks to online shopping, the Chinese market is growing 60 percent annually and next year could be worth 280 billion yuan ($46 billion), said consultancy Deloitte. “We now have 33 licenses,” UPS President of Global Public Affairs Laura Lane told Reuters. “The government just approved them in May,” Lane said, referring to UPS’s latest 14 licenses for cities including Beijing, Wuhan and Hefei. “We’re really looking at developing those capabilities in those 33 cities, expanding our investment,” Lane said. “But we haven’t developed a concrete plan yet in terms of where we want to go beyond those 33 cities.” FedEx received 21 licenses in May, returning its total to the 58 it held before the 2009 law, a spokesman told Reuters. Each license permits the holder to operate B2C domestic express package services within a single city and between cities for which a license is also held. “We have been working closely with the relevant authorities to obtain the express delivery services permits for our business,” the spokesman said. “So far we have received all the permits for our domestic business.” Neither company has disclosed the size of their businesses in China, where since 2009 they have mainly handled documents and packages to and from overseas. But both companies have cited China as one of their fastest-growing markets. UPS and FedEx had to reapply for licenses to offer domestic B2C services after the law changed. In 2012, the pair were granted their first five and eight respectively. FedEx was able to continue offering services by entering joint ventures with local peers. But even at full strength, UPS and FedEx still face daunting competition in state-backed China Post and large, privately run rivals such as Shentong Express and S.F. Express.  Seeming willingness among private services to cut margins to win customers also constitutes a challenge. Deutsche Post AG’s (DPWGn.DE) DHL courier service pulled out of its money-losing China domestic delivery business in 2011 citing a lack of cost advantage. UPS’s Lane said allowing greater competition would help improve standards across China’s logistics industry. “With greater competition there’s always the beneficial effect of raising the professionalism and quality of services that consumers come to expect,” Lane said.

258,FDX,"UPDATE 2-U.S. court clears FedEx Ground drivers to pursue wage, benefit claims","(Adds background, context) By Amanda Becker Aug 27 (Reuters) - Groups of mostly former FedEx drivers in California and Oregon can move forward with lawsuits alleging they are owed unpaid wages and benefits under state and federal labor laws after a U.S. appeals court said Wednesday they were employees, not independent contractors. A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting in Portland, Oregon, reversed a lower court’s ruling, noting that FedEx drivers wear company uniforms, drive company-approved vehicles and are told where and when to deliver packages. The appeals court noted that the claims brought by the California and Oregon drivers are among similar cases filed against FedEx in approximately 40 states. Other courts have sided with FedEx, finding that drivers are independent contractors. FedEx said Wednesday it will challenge the decision, and will ask the full 9th Circuit to review the panel’s findings. “We fundamentally disagree with these rulings,” FedEx Ground Senior Vice President and General Counsel Cary Blancett said in a statement. The FedEx cases highlight how employees and independent contractors are entitled to different rights and protections under a patchwork of federal and state labor laws. Non-exempt employees are entitled to overtime compensation under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, protection under state minimum wage laws and time off under the Family Medical Leave Act, for example, whereas independent contractors are not. The California case was brought by about 2,300 workers who were full-time FedEx delivery drivers between 2000 and 2007. The Oregon claims were brought by roughly 360 full-time FedEx delivery drivers between 1999 and 2009. Under the terms of an operating agreement used by FedEx, the drivers were classified as independent contractors, court documents state. But, FedEx had a “broad right to control the manner in which its drivers perform their work,” the panel wrote in determining the drivers were employees. The panel highlighted the fact that FedEx assigned the drivers delivery areas, directed where packages went and assessed drivers’ workloads. Though drivers provided their own vehicles, the agreement used by FedEx mandated that vans have certain dimensions, the FedEx logo and be painted a specific shade of Sherwin-Williams paint known as “FedEx white”. FedEx said that it is no longer using the operating agreement on which the 9th Circuit’s rulings were based and that it has updated its agreements to reflect state-level legal and regulatory changes, clarifying that FedEx Ground drivers are independent contractors. The cases are Dean Alexander, et al v. FedEx Ground Package System Inc dba FedEx Home Delivery and Edward Slayman, et al v. FedEx Ground Package System Inc dba FedEx Home Delivery, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 12-17458 and 12-35525.

The union touted the victory as an organizing inroad into the Memphis-based company. FedEx on Wednesday forecast a record holiday season due to the continued rise of online consumer sales and said it would add more than 50,000 seasonal workers to handle the anticipated spike in shipping. “FedEx is the largest non-union company in North America,” said Stan Hennessy, president of Teamsters Local 31. “With this small success up here in B.C, this will encourage more warehousemen and truck drivers throughout Canada and the U.S. to certify with the union.” Hennessy said the FedEx workers unionized because of issues with work hours, wages and benefits, which the group will look to address in a first contract.

265,FDX,FedEx sees e-commerce driving record holiday season,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Package delivery company FedEx Corp should enjoy a record holiday peak season thanks to the continued rise of  online consumer sales in the United States, company officials said on Wednesday. Executive vice president Michael Glenn said on a conference call with analysts after FedEx reported better-than-expected quarterly results that the company would add more than 50,000 seasonal workers to handle the anticipated spike in shipping.  Alongside its main rival United Parcel Service Inc, FedEx is considered a bellwether of U.S. economic activity.   FedEx has been in an “active dialogue with our retail and E-tail customers all year to understand their peak shipping needs and plan our operations accordingly,” Glenn said. UPS announced this week that it would hire up to 95,000 seasonal workers for peak season, nearly double the 55,000 it hired last year. A surge in online shopping and severe weather  last Christmas caught UPS off guard, resulting in delays that angered customers. Beyond the holiday season, FedEx expects the U.S. economy to grow at a rate of 3.1 percent in 2015. The company said the global economy should also grow at a rate of 3.1 percent next year.  Constraints across America’s supply chain system as the economy grows have enabled shipping and transport companies to raise prices for customers. That pricing power is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Late Tuesday FedEx announced an across-the-board 4.9 percent rate increase effective early January 2015.  FedEx reported a better-than-expected 24 percent jump in quarterly profit Wednesday as it benefited from higher shipment volumes. The company’s net income rose to $606 million, or $2.l0 per share, in the first quarter ended Aug. 31, from $489 million, or $1.53 per share, a year earlier.  Revenue increased 6 percent to $11.7 billion. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.96 per share on revenue of $11.48 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Coupled with solid general rate increases announced last night...FedEx appears well positioned in the competitive landscape to outperform through the peak season,” Citigroup analyst Christian Wetherbee wrote in a note for clients. FedEx Ground average daily volume grew 6 percent in the quarter, primarily driven by growth in e-commerce, the company said. The company also reaffirmed its 2015 earnings forecast of $8.50-$9.00 per share. Analysts are expecting earnings of $8.84 per share. In early trading FedEx’s shares were up 3.4 percent at $159.96.

271,FDX,FedEx expects record peak volume of 22.6 mln packages on Dec. 15,"CHICAGO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Package delivery company FedEx Corp on Wednesday forecast a record holiday season this year, with 22.6 million shipments expected for its anticipated peak day on Dec. 15. The Memphis-based company said it looks to move more than 290 million packages between Black Friday, the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday that kicks off the holiday shopping season, and Christmas Eve. With the rise of e-commerce, FedEx’s annual peak has nearly doubled since 2007, when it moved 11.5 million packages on Dec. 17. Last year a later-than-usual surge before the holidays left an estimated 2 million packages stranded on Christmas Eve, a problem that affected Atlanta-based United Parcel Service Inc  far more than FedEx. “We’re very proud of our performance last year when we faced the most challenging weather in our company’s history,” said Patrick Fitzgerald, vice president of integrated marketing and communications at FedEx. “We have worked in a very collaborative way with our retail partners to see what their needs are going to be and we stand ready to deliver.” FedEx has said up to 90 percent of its $1.2 billion in capital investments this year are designed to increase capacity to handle peak season. The company plans to hire 50,000 seasonal workers, up from 40,000 last year. UPS has not yet provided a peak holiday volume forecast for this year, but typically does so after it reports third-quarter earnings, which are due on Oct 24. UPS has said it will take on 95,000 seasonal workers to handle holiday packages, up from around 55,000 last year.

272,FDX,"UPS, FedEx seek ways to manage massive peak season package bulge","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Determined not to repeat a holiday season that left millions of packages delivered too late and customers seething, United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) are investing heavily in new infrastructure - but the continued dynamic growth of e-commerce will test those efforts.  The world’s two largest shipping companies are building new facilities, adding more temporary holiday workers and pushing retailers to help them avoid a recurrence of a pre-Christmas shipping logjam.  Even so, the rise in shipping originating with e-tailers including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Zappos could test even the new capacity levels. Peak days at both companies now equal roughly double their average daily volumes.  Mark Wallace, vice president of engineering in the United States at UPS, said the company still has volume limits, despite substantial investment this year. “There is only so much capacity in the network.” A late spike in demand last year caused by last-minute online promotions plagued express delivery companies.  Some 2 million express packages were left stranded by delivery companies on Christmas Eve, according to shipment-tracking software developer ShipMatrix Inc. UPS experienced far more severe problems than FedEx.   This year, UPS has allocated $500 million to expand and improve facilities and is hiring 95,000 seasonal workers - or 10,000 more than last year - to handle 2014 holiday packages. During its second-quarter conference call, UPS Chief Executive David Abney said “these projects will weigh on earnings in 2014” but pay off long-term. A spokesman declined to comment further ahead of UPS’s next quarterly earnings, expected to be released on Friday.   FedEx has said up to 90 percent of its $1.2 billion investments this year are to boost capacity. The company plans to hire 50,000 seasonal workers, up from 40,000 last year. Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of marketing and communications at FedEx, said this year’s capital investments would not affect the company’s earnings forecast. The investment is designed to address the rapid growth of consumer goods ordered online. Through 2013, peak volume, referring to the busiest day of the year, had climbed 57 percent over five years at FedEx, to 22 million packages. It jumped 40 percent at UPS, to 31 million packages.  Deloitte LLP predicts sales growth of up to 14 percent this holiday season, and FedEx said on Wednesday it expected peak-day package volumes to reach 22.6 million this year.  The peaks have become more pronounced closer to Christmas as last-minute online free shipping deals have proliferated. Unchecked, those peaks will only grow worse, experts said.  “The e-commerce shipping model isn’t sustainable in its current form,” said Yossi Sheffi, a professor of engineering systems and director of the Center for Transportation & Logistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). “You cannot build a shipping network to operate 365 days a year based on a spike in packages three days before Christmas.”  In a bid to better manage the peak, the shipping giants have asked retailers for clearer estimates of 2014 holiday volumes and have encouraged earlier deadlines for consumer orders.  “We now have the kind of visibility we didn’t before on what to expect from our largest customers,” said UPS’s Wallace. FedEx’s Fitzgerald said customers could be disappointed if they offer last-minute sales without first consulting FedEx. “If we don’t have the right discussions up-front, we may not be ready to handle” a sudden surge, Fitzgerald said.   In mid-August, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) gave its carriers its peak forecast, both by day and by shipping facility, three weeks earlier than usual. Contingency plans include shipping from alternate Wal-Mart distribution centers or upgrading packages to faster services if “deemed at risk” of missing Christmas, said spokeswoman Jaeme Lazckowski. Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) has moved up its cutoff point for Christmas deliveries by three hours on Dec. 23, and UPS has agreed to additional last-minute flights for the company.   FedEx and UPS had no choice but to engage retailers in reducing peak loads and getting them to manage consumer expectations on realistic delivery deadlines, said veteran Cowan & Co analyst Helane Becker. “They can’t keep trying to squeeze more and more through such a narrow funnel,” she said.  Both FedEx and UPS are concerned about impact on their core business-to-business customers.   “When packages went undelivered last year, that also affected high-volume business customers,” said Rick Jones, a former UPS executive and now CEO of regional delivery company Lone Star Overnight. “Have no doubt this is not about getting little Johnny his Christmas present. It’s about protecting that core business.” Logistics experts say the 2014 adjustments are a temporary fix, and more changes are needed for the 2015 holiday season. A price hike might help tackle ubiquitous free shipping offers, and negotiations with Amazon, in particular, likely will occur.   “What you will see is Amazon Prime with a little minus for the three days before Christmas - where free shipping doesn’t apply,” said MIT’s Sheffi. “And Amazon will be able to blame UPS for it anyway.” Amazon declined specific comment. “We work very closely with all of our delivery partners and are confident in their ability to deliver for Amazon customers this holiday,” the company said in a statement.  FedEx’s Fitzgerald said the company does not plan a 2015 price increase “at this point.” A UPS spokesman said the company has focused on fixing last year’s problems instead of pricing.

275,FDX,"Teamsters step up union drive at FedEx Freight, Con-way","CHICAGO (Reuters) - After years of failed efforts, the Teamsters union has won a toehold in the trucking units of FedEx and Con-way and is targeting more facilities at both, potentially threatening what analysts see as a core competitive advantage for the companies.   The push by the Teamsters comes as a shortage of experienced drivers in the trucking industry is prompting companies to hike pay and offer improved working conditions. The International Brotherhood Teamsters, which represents 1.4 million workers and is one of North America’s most powerful unions, has long tried to unionize workers at FedEx Corp and last month won votes to have union representation at two local FedEx Freight facilities out of three holding secret ballots. Five ballots are scheduled at FedEx Freight facilities this month, with the next due on Nov. 12 in Newark, New Jersey. With the exception of its pilots, FedEx’s workforce is non-unionized. While pay for its drivers is above that of some competitors, its larger rival United Parcel Service Inc pays its unionized drivers more, and FedEx has higher profit margins.  The Teamsters also won two out of four recent ballots at Con-way Freight, part of Con-way Inc, which according to industry estimates pays slightly more than FedEx but less than UPS. The Teamsters declined to comment for this article.  The expanding U.S. economy has driven up freight demand at a time when older truckers are retiring and fewer new drivers are signing up. That shortage hurts long-haul truckers more than less-than-truckload operators like FedEx Freight and Con-way Freight, which fill up trucks with smaller orders from multiple customers. But it has forced up pay across the industry. In April, FedEx announced pay increases for 19,000 FedEx Freight drivers at the unit’s 360 facilities, effective October. “Drivers and dock workers currently have the ball in their court, and it may be there for a long while,” Cowen & Co analyst Jason Seidl said in an Oct. 30 client note, adding Con-way’s battle against the Teamsters could weigh on its results short term. FedEx Freight accounted for $5.8 billion of FedEx’s $45.6 billion fiscal 2014 revenue, while Con-way Freight contributed $3.5 billion of Con-way’s $5.5 billion revenue in 2013. Both companies are fighting the unionization effort. After the Teamsters scored wins against Con-way, one in September and one in October, the company filed objections to the ballots with the National Labor Relations Board claiming the union intimidated workers, and emphasizes the union’s victories affect only two out of around 300 facilities.      “We don’t believe we need a third party between ourselves and our employees,” Con-way Chief Executive Officer Doug Stotlar told analysts in an Oct. 31 conference call. FedEx has said it is weighing an appeal with the NLRB against the most recent vote in favor of union representation on Oct. 31 at a facility in New Jersey. While gains have so far been small - there are only about 150 drivers at the FedEx Freight facilities where the Teamsters won ballots - the union said on its website other campaigns were under way.  “The aim here appears to be to unionize an entire sector,” said Dan Cornfield, a Vanderbilt University labor analyst. But it could be an uphill struggle. According to data compiled by industry expert SJ Consulting Group Inc, as of July this year Con-way Freight drivers made $24.75 an hour, while FedEx Freight drivers earned $24.40. Among unionized companies, wages at ArcBest Corp were $23.17 and $21.10 at YRC Worldwide Inc. Unionized truckers at UPS Freight make an estimated $26.65. SJ Consulting founder Satish Jindel said the Teamsters will likely face difficulty persuading FedEx Freight and Con-way Freight drivers that collective bargaining is a boon when two major unionized carriers pay less. “FedEx Freight and Con-way are seasoned campaigners, as they have been fighting unionization for decades,” he said. “They are not going to be easy targets for the Teamsters.” ",11102014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fedex-unions/teamsters-step-up-union-drive-at-fedex-freight-con-way-idUSKCN0IU24S20141110

286,FDX,FedEx profit misses expectations; stock down,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - FedEx Corp on Wednesday posted lower-than-expected quarterly earnings as results at its FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight units missed estimates, and it reiterated an outlook analysts consider conservative, sending its stock down nearly 5 percent. Both FedEx and main rival United Parcel Service Inc are in the final days of their peak holiday season, which has boomed over the past decade due to the rise of e-commerce. Last year both companies were hit by a last-minute surge in online orders and bad weather, leaving an estimated 2 million packages undelivered on Christmas Eve.  The two companies have worked with online retailers in hopes of avoiding a repeat of last year. So far the plans appeared to be paying off. On a conference call with analysts, FedEx executives said labor problems at West Coast ports this year had left cargo shipments backed up over the last three months, causing inventory shortages.  Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx reported net income of $616 million, or $2.14 per share, for the second quarter ended Nov. 30, up from $500 million, or $1.57 a share, a year earlier.  Analysts on average had expected $2.22 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Revenue totaled $11.9 billion, below expectations of $11.99 billion, and was up in all of FedEx’s major business segments.  Volumes at FedEx Ground in the United States were up 7 percent for the quarter, but revenue per package fell 2 percent due in part to lower fuel surcharges, which decline as fuel prices come down. Package volumes were up 5 percent in the international economy business and rose 1 percent in the international priority business.  FedEx said it benefited from an ongoing profit improvement plan, falling fuel prices and lower pension expenses, partly offset by aircraft maintenance costs. The company still expects earnings per share of $8.50 to $9.00 for the year ending May 31. Analysts have forecast $9.14. Analysts said results from FedEx Ground and trucking unit FedEx Freight, in particular fell short. The company’s full-year outlook was also seen as too conservative.   “We believe that investors were anticipating an upside second quarter and an increase in (full-year) 2015 guidance ... and as a result we expect pressure on (FedEx) stock today,” UBS analysts wrote in a note to clients.

A strengthening U.S. economy is expected to trump global economic worries and the Fed is likely to signal it is still on track to raise rates, with many investors devoting attention to whether the central bank drops its longstanding view that it would wait a “considerable time” before raising rates. “I don’t know that it really makes a huge difference because ultimately they will hedge anything they do in that regard by simply saying it is all data-dependent,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin. “There does seem to be a lot of focus on the language, but I don’t know that the removal of the language, even if it happens, really brings the date of rate increases any closer if the data doesn’t support it.” U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest drop in nearly six years in November as gasoline prices tumbled, but this probably will do little to change views the Fed will start raising interest rates in mid-2015. The Fed’s statement is due at 2:00 p.m. (1900 GMT) and will be followed by a news conference by Chair Janet Yellen half an hour later.

U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest drop in nearly six years in November as gasoline prices tumbled, but this probably will do little to change views the Fed will start raising interest rates in mid-2015. “I do think they will take in consideration slow global economic activity and perhaps mention the threat of deflation in Europe,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. “If there isn’t a change in language, that would be the surprise,” he said, adding that as the U.S. economy continues to strengthen and lower oil prices give a boost to the consumer “the year-end rally in stocks will resume.” The Fed’s statement is due at 2:00 p.m. (1900 GMT) and will be followed by a news conference by Chair Janet Yellen half an hour later. S&P; 500 e-mini futures were up 10 points and fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract, indicated a higher open. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures rose 64 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures added 17 points.

298,FDX,"Small U.S. firms may struggle with new UPS, FedEx dimensional prices","CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) are rolling out new pricing systems to curb online retailers’ large package sizes, but industry experts warn many small firms are unprepared and could pay up to 50 percent more for shipping. Starting Monday, UPS will no longer charge for U.S. ground packages under 3 cubic feet by weight but by their “dimensional weight.” Memphis-based FedEx will roll out the same change on Jan 5. Instead of simply weighing a box, retailers must multiply its length by its height and width, and then divide that by 166 to reach its dimensional weight. “We believe this (dimensional weight pricing) will encourage customers to reduce their package sizes,” Bill Smith, UPS vice president of marketing, told Reuters. UPS and FedEx announced the change in May and have worked to help customers adjust. But some small firms lack the resources to change packaging and may switch to the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), said Amine Khechfe, general manager of Endicia, which offers shipping solutions for e-commerce vendors. Under the new systems, according to Endicia, a woman’s shoulder bag weighing 2 pounds – shipped in a box measuring 19 by 15 by 5 inches - will have a dimensional weight of 9 pounds and cost 45 percent more to ship. Atlanta-based UPS says retailers are shipping lighter goods, but have not shrunk the size of their packaging materials. “We need to charge a fair value for use of our asset, which in this case is space,” FedEx spokesman Jess Bunn told Reuters. Online retailers such as Amazon (AMZN.O) are expected to be prepared. But smaller firms like Oregon-based Natura Health Products would struggle: It expects to pay 36 percent more for shipping many packages.  Natura sells nutritional supplement products, many for cancer patients, and spends about $180,000 a year on shipping through FedEx and USPS, said logistics manager Chris Thorsen. To avoid such increases, the company will shift more shipping business in 2015 to USPS. The share shipped by USPS will rise to about 50 percent from 40 percent in 2014. The USPS still charges by weight. In July, it announced some price cuts to target e-commerce. Research firm Morningstar estimates e-commerce will grow at least 10 percent annually over the next five years.

Materials shares weighed on the S&P; 500, falling 1.3 percent in afternoon trading. Goldman cut its price target on Freeport McMoRan by 42 percent to $18 and cut prices on other miners, and separately slashed forecasts on commodity prices including aluminum, copper and nickel. UPS was the largest drag on the S&P; 500, followed closely by Exxon Mobil. On Friday Credit Suisse cut Exxon to “underperform.” A jump in Starbucks shares on the back of strong quarterly earnings results helped partly offset losses. Declines were capped, moreover, by bullish investor sentiment after Thursday’s move from the European Central Bank, which detailed a bigger-than-expected bond-buying program to lift the region’s sagging economy and fight deflation.

UPS gave a fourth-quarter earnings outlook that was below expectations, citing a disappointing performance in U.S. domestic ground shipments. Shares slumped 9.6 percent to $103.30. Oil major Exxon’s shares fell 1.8 percent to $91.22. With 18 percent of S&P; 500 companies having reported, 72.2 percent have topped earnings expectations, while 54.4 percent have beaten on revenue, according to Thomson Reuters data. That compares with the long-term average of 63 percent for earnings and 61 percent for revenue. Starbucks rose 6.3 percent to $87.98 a day after the coffee chain reported same-store sales growth that was better than expected in its Americas region.

The world’s largest package delivery company, citing a disappointing performance in U.S. domestic ground shipments,  said its fourth-quarter earnings per share would come in below market expectations. The comments sent UPS shares down 9.2 percent to $103.73 at midday. “Clearly, our financial performance during the quarter was disappointing,” UPS Chief Executive Officer David Abney said in a regulatory filing. “Going forward, we will reduce operating costs and implement new pricing strategies during peak season.” UPS also said 2015 earnings-per-share growth would be slightly below its long-term target ranging from 9 percent to 13 percent. In a separate announcement, main rival FedEx reaffirmed its earnings outlook for its fiscal 2015 year ending May 31. During the 2013 peak season UPS and FedEx Corp were hit by a late surge in online orders that left an estimated 2 million packages stranded on Christmas Eve. Both companies worked last year to avoid a repeat. UPS spent $500 million on network improvements to handle anticipated growth in e-commerce shipments. The Atlanta-based company expects earnings of approximately $1.25 per share for the fourth quarter. Analysts estimated $1.47. Its international business was also hurt by one-time charges and negative foreign exchange comparisons. UPS also said it will take a noncash, aftertax charge of $670 million related to its pension plans. The company said it prepared its network to handle a spike in package volumes on Cyber Monday and on its peak day, Dec. 22. But demand was less than expected on those days. As a result, UPS was hurt by a decline in productivity and extra costs it incurred on those days. “I think UPS was so concerned about the horrible 2013 they over-planned for 2014, and voila, they spent too much money and hired too many people to handle what wound up being a muddled peak,” said Helane Becker, an analyst at Cowen & Company. Becker said the peak season was also affected by the slowdown at West Coast ports, a problem FedEx highlighted in a Dec. 17 earnings conference call. She said raising peak prices was a smart move under the circumstances, but added some large customers will push back.

310,FDX,UPDATE 1-U.S. aviation giants split on Gulf carrier subsidy row,"(Adds airports letter, further Boeing comment) By Jeffrey Dastin and Tim Hepher Feb 26 (Reuters) - A push by three U.S. airlines to curb competition from Gulf state carriers has exposed divisions over free trade with other powerful U.S. aviation players including Boeing Co and FedEx Corp, potentially complicating the airlines’ campaign for Obama administration support. Delta Air Lines Inc, United and American Airlines have asked the White House to look into the financial statements of competitors from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, which they accuse of receiving more than $40 billion in government subsidies since 2004. But calls for the United States to tamper with Open Skies agreements with the Gulf nations are at odds with the stance of other major U.S. companies that benefit from the pacts. The agreements eliminate barriers that would block some FedEx operations and slow the expansion of carriers like Emirates that have showered Boeing with orders. Boeing, which like European rival Airbus has filled its order book with commitments from Gulf carriers, said it would continue to support pacts such as the more than 100 Open Skies agreements negotiated by the U.S. since the 1990s. “Boeing supports a commercial-aviation industry based on open and fair competition, and Open Skies has long been a key factor in this, benefiting both U.S. and international airlines,” spokesman Jim Proulx said in an emailed statement. Boeing later added that it was not jumping directly into the feud between some of its biggest airline customers. “We are in no position to make judgments about the allegations, nor is it our role to do so,” spokesman Tim Neale said. But experts say the groundswell of support for Open Skies from Boeing, FedEx and others could make it easier for the White House to resist renegotiating individual agreements. “I think the entry into the fray of Boeing and the others as countervailing pressures to the airlines will make it easier politically for the administration to do what I believe the Department of Transportation wants to do, namely, to continue to pursue its successful Open Skies strategy,” said New York University law professor Michael E. Levine. Other companies were more blunt. “The U.S. should not capitulate to the interests of a few carriers who stand ready to put their narrow, protectionist interests ahead of the economic benefits that Open Skies provides,” David Bronczeck, chief executive of FedEx’s Express air cargo unit said in a Feb. 18 letter to the heads of the U.S. Departments of State, Transportation and Commerce. JetBlue Airways Corp, which has a codeshare agreement with Emirates, wrote a similar letter. Meanwhile, a group representing 200 North American airports said it had written to the Obama administration warning that the U.S. “leadership role” in international aviation could be threatened by any weakening of the Open Skies policy. Delta, United Continental Holdings Inc and American Airlines Group Inc say in the report - which has been reviewed by Reuters but not yet been made public - that they support Open Skies agreements but not their abuse through what they regard as trade-distorting Gulf subsidies. Historically, however, analysts say the top U.S. carriers have been involved in frequent disputes about liberalization. “The major U.S. carriers have opposed Open Skies and deregulation all along the way, even from the word go, and yet have been major beneficiaries due to domestic consolidation and also globally in terms of market access,” said Peter Harbison, a chairman of Sydney-based consultancy CAPA-Centre for Aviation. Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways deny receiving subsidies. So far, the Obama administration says it is reviewing the U.S. airlines’ claims but has made no decisions. In an interview with Reuters Wednesday, Emirates  President Tim Clark hinted at possible legal action over potential commercial harm done by the U.S. airlines’ campaign. The clash between Delta and the Gulf airlines has taken a caustic turn, including remarks by Delta’s chief executive that were perceived as linking the Gulf carriers with the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States in 2001.. Delta later clarified its remarks and apologized. Clark also called his U.S. rivals’ service “shoddy” and said they would do better to focus on improving their own product. The Business Travel Coalition, a for-profit company whose clients include travel agents and corporate travel managers, agrees that the top U.S. airlines have only themselves to blame for the market share loss, a contention disputed by Delta. Still, the U.S. airlines may have one trump card to play in the form of Americans for Fair Skies, an organization opposed to alleged Gulf subsidies that is the project of former Air Line Pilots Association President and former Delta captain, Lee Moak.

314,FDX,U.S. airline unions join campaign against Gulf carriers,"(Reuters) - U.S. airline unions have added their voices to their employers’ escalating campaign to persuade the United States to alter commercial flying agreements with Qatar and the United Arab Emirates amid allegations of unfair subsidies. In a press conference with U.S. airline officials Thursday, several union leaders repeated the airlines’ warning that U.S. workers will lose their jobs if domestic airlines are pushed out of key markets because of competition from three Gulf airlines. They also repeated the allegations by U.S. airlines that Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways have received billions of dollars of subsidies from their home states, which those three carriers have strongly denied. The Gulf carriers say U.S. airlines are losing market share because of their inferior service. “This impacts our careers,” said Rick Dominguez, the executive administrator of the Air Line Pilots Association. “We have an obligation to not only expose the (subsidies), but to call upon our government to make it right.” The allegations have created a politically charged dogfight, with companies such as FedEx Corp asking the Obama administration not to alter the “Open Skies” agreements, from which FedEx has benefited, and saying the U.S. airlines have protectionist interests. Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines intend to release a 55 page white paper detailing the allegations against the Gulf carriers following demands from their opponents for a wider release.

Cities ranging from Chicago to Bangor, Maine, set all time records for the lowest February temperatures. Boston got more than 100 inches of snow, crippling mass transit and prompting the system’s head to quit. Lexington, Kentucky, is covered in more than 20 inches of snow, the result of the biggest snowstorm since 1943. In Miami, it was 83 under sunny skies on Thursday. Still, it’s not all misery, all the time. While the relentless weather has dented traffic and sales for restaurants and mall retailers and frustrated delivery firms like United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp, it’s increased sales of snow shovels and rock salt from local hardware stores as well as Home Depot Inc and Lowe’s Cos . “Cold is like gold,” said Matthew Maloney, the chief executive of online meal delivery service GrubHub Inc , based in Chicago and New York and affiliated with about 30,000 restaurants. In the afternoon before winter storm Juno hit the Northeast at the end of January, the size of GrubHub’s orders rose 45 percent, with cheese pizza and hot chocolate orders more than doubling, according to company data provided to Reuters. If and when the weather gets nicer, the home improvement stores will look forward to customers looking to fix damaged lawns, gardens and siding. Carmakers, who posted disappointing February sales, could rebound if consumers opt to replace less reliable or damaged vehicles. Clothing stores may languish further if temperatures don’t rise soon enough to persuade shoppers it’s time to buy spring apparel. “If people look outside and see walls of snow, they’re not going to buy a t-shirt,” said Simeon Siegel, an analyst at Nomura. February shopper traffic in the U.S. fell 12.5 percent compared with same month last year, and sales overall fell 10.4 percent, according to RetailNext, a research firm. The decline could have been worse if more of the storms occurred on the weekends because that’s when shoppers restock groceries and visit the malls, analysts said. At Amazon.com, the top sellers on Thursday included humidifiers, snow melt products and a $19.99 device called the Paw Plunger, used to clean Fido’s paws, the company said.

318,FDX,FedEx must face NY claims over contraband cigarettes,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday said FedEx Corp must face claims that it violated federal law by delivering contraband cigarettes in New York, cheating the state and New York City out of millions of dollars of excise taxes. U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos in Manhattan denied FedEx’s bid to dismiss claims it violated an anti-racketeering law and the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act by knowingly shipping nearly 400,000 cartons of untaxed cigarettes to individual residences from 2005 to 2012. But the judge also dismissed a claim seeking civil fines for alleged violations of a state public health law, saying a 2013 amendment did not apply retroactively. Ramos separately dismissed a claim that FedEx created a public nuisance by distributing cigarettes at less than the legal price. The lawsuit had sought roughly $239 million in fines and alleged unpaid taxes. A similar lawsuit seeking more than $180 million was filed last month against FedEx rival United Parcel Service Inc. “We are pleased that the court agreed with several of our arguments in granting, in part, our motion to dismiss, and we look forward to continuing to defend this matter vigorously,” FedEx spokesman Perry Colosimo said in a statement. Eric Proshansky, a lawyer for the city, said: “We are pleased that the court upheld our most significant claims.” A spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman had no comment. The lawsuit against FedEx claimed that the Memphis, Tennessee-based company cost the state between $15 and $43.50 per carton, and the city $15 per carton, in excise taxes by illegally delivering cigarettes on behalf of various sellers. These sellers included a shop on the Shinnecock Indian Nation reservation in Southampton, New York, among others. A carton of cigarettes usually contains 10 packs. In letting some claims go forward, Ramos said the state and city alleged in sufficient detail that FedEx “had some part in directing the affairs of the cigarette seller enterprises.”  The case is City of New York et al v.

But the judge also dismissed a claim seeking civil fines for alleged violations of a state public health law, saying a 2013 amendment did not apply retroactively. Ramos separately dismissed a claim that FedEx created a public nuisance by distributing cigarettes at less than the legal price. The lawsuit had sought roughly $239 million in fines and alleged unpaid taxes. A similar lawsuit seeking more than $180 million was filed last month against FedEx rival United Parcel Service Inc. FedEx, representatives for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and the New York City law department had no immediate comment. The lawsuit against FedEx claimed that the company cost the state between $15 and $43.50 per carton, and the city $15 per carton, in excise taxes by illegally delivering cigarettes on behalf of various sellers, including a shop located on the Shinnecock Indian Nation reservation in Southampton, New York. A carton of cigarettes usually contains 10 packs. In letting some of the claims go forward, Ramos said the state and city alleged in sufficient detail that Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx “had some part in directing the affairs of the cigarette seller enterprises.” The case is City of New York et al v.

323,FDX,Grizzlies bounce back to defeat Bucks,"Grizzlies bounce back to defeat Bucks MEMPHIS, Tenn. — After getting a reboot during the end of a forgettable Eastern road swing, the Memphis Grizzlies regained their balance as a team and rolled to a 96-83 win over the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday night before a sellout crowd of 18,119 at FedEx Forum. Grizzlies coach Dave Joerger sat center Mark Gasol, power forward Zach Randolph, point guard Mike Conley and dervish Tony Allen on Thursday while Memphis endured a 20-point national TV loss at Washington. On Saturday, a sputtering Grizzlies offense found a modest spark by the end of the first quarter and by game’s end, everybody seemed to get into the act. All five Grizzlies starters finished in double figures, led by 17 points from struggling shooting guard Courtney Lee and 15 each from forwards Jeff Green and Randolph. “I came in (on the off day) and got in extra shots. We all got to rest and recover a bit,” Lee said. “I’d been getting open shots, but I needed to see a few go in yesterday, and once we hit some today, we got confidence. It also allowed us to set up our defense.” Memphis coach Dave Joerger said, “Lee got open looks and with him as this focal point sets the table for so many other guys.” Beno Udrih, subbing for Conley (ankle sprain) at the point, had 15 points and Gasol had 12 points, seven rebounds and seven assists despite missing some of the first half with a knee tweak. The Grizzlies shot 47.4 percent from the field and were 8 of 14 from 3-point range, getting two each from Green, Lee, Udrih and guard Vince Carter. “For us, where we are, I thought we took a step forward tonight. ... It’s not about trying to get wins; it’s trying to play as well as we can,” Joerger said. The Bucks, who have lost eight straight on the road, were led by 19 points from forward Giannis Antetotokounmpo, including 13 in the first half. Guard Khris Middleton added 17, center Zaza Pachulia 14 and forward Ersan Ilyasova 12. Michael Carter-Williams, who hurt his ankle in Orlando then came back with 28 points in an overtime loss at Indiana Thursday, was a late scratch Saturday. Tyler Ennis got the start and dished out 11 assists to go with seven points. “It wasn’t a setback. The next guy was up and I thought Tyler played a great game,” Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. “I thought some of our guys got better tonight.” But after the Bucks closed to 63-58 early in the third quarter, they were never a factor. The Grizzlies went on a 15-3 run to close the quarter, sparked by two buckets from Randolph and then a feed to Allen for a three-point play. “We gave ourselves a chance (in the third quarter) but didn’t take advantage,” Ennis said. “We have to do a better job of that.” Kidd said, “The second and third quarters we have been struggling a little bit getting stops. ... We have to look at getting a little bit tired defensively.” The Bucks got the first punch in, bolting to a 14-4 lead behind six quick points from Antetotokounmpo. Memphis continued a trend of flat-footed starts, turning the ball over four times in the first four minutes. But a couple of mid-range jumpers each from Udrih and Lee led to a burst of muscle by Randolph, and that seemed to oil the gears for the Grizzlies, who chased the Bucks down and took a 22-20 lead by the end of the quarter. Memphis stretched the lead to double digits in the second quarter before a couple of late 3-pointers helped Milwaukee close to 49-42 at the break. Gasol left the game with 3:11 left in the second quarter after tweaking his right knee on a collision. He went to the dressing room briefly but came back, scored three buckets and also finished the half with five assists. NOTES: The Grizzlies limped home after a 1-3 trip that ended with coach Dave Joerger sitting Gasol, Randolph, Conley and Allen in a 107-87 loss at Washington. “You don’t do that for short-term response but more long-term. We’d been scaling back their minutes already,” said Joerger, whose team had played eight games in 12 days. “What you do hope to see when they come back is some energy and fight.” ... Conley was inactive for the second straight game with an ankle sprain suffered in Wednesday’s loss at Boston. “He’s day to day, and I’m in no hurry,” Joerger said of Conley. ... Grizzlies F Jon Leuer (back contusion) did not play Saturday. Former Grizzlies G O.J. Mayo came back from a hamstring but struggled offensively, while backup G Jerryd Bayless, who also once played in Memphis, sat out again with an ankle injury. It was a game-time decision. ... The Grizzlies are 7-6 since the All-Star break, while Milwaukee is 4-9. ... The Grizzlies are home Monday night against Denver, while the Bucks travel to New Orleans to try and snap a 12-game losing streak against the Pelicans.",3152015,http://www.reuters.com/article/bkn-bucks-grizzlies-writethru/grizzlies-bounce-back-to-defeat-bucks-idUSMTZEB3F8F6XE520150315

325,FDX,"UPDATE 3-FedEx 3rd-qtr profit jumps, outlook lags market view","(New throughout, adds analyst comment) By Nick Carey March 18 (Reuters) - Package delivery company FedEx Corp  reported a better-than-expected quarterly net profit on Wednesday but forecast full-year earnings would be below analysts’ estimates due to lackluster global economic growth. Memphis-based FedEx also said fuel expenses fell 30 percent due to low oil prices but its international business was hurt by declining fuel surcharges and the strong dollar. The quarter included FedEx’s crucial peak U.S. holiday season. “We had a very successful peak season as volumes grew across all our segments,” Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith said on a conference call with analysts. Last month, FedEx’s main rival, United Parcel Service Inc , reported a disappointing profit due to soaring peak season costs. UPS mobilized workers and equipment for an anticipated holiday surge that failed to materialize, forcing the company to begin applying surcharges for residential packages for this year’s peak season. FedEx’s operating expenses rose just 1 percent during the quarter, while UPS’ fourth-quarter expenses jumped nearly 16 percent, which also included a pension-related charge. FedEx said on its earnings call it expects the U.S. economy to grow at a rate of 3.1 percent in both 2015 and 2016. FedEx said fiscal third-quarter net profit soared 53 percent to $580 million, or $2.01 per share, from $378 million, or $1.23 per share, a year earlier. Analysts expected earnings per share of $1.87. Revenue for the quarter ended Feb. 28 totaled $11.7 billion, up nearly 4 percent from $11.3 billion a year earlier. Analysts estimated $11.79 billion. The company expects full-year earnings in a range of $8.80 to $8.95 per share, which it said “assumes continued moderate global economic growth.” Analysts had expected earnings of $8.97 for the full fiscal year ending May 31. In a note for clients, Cowen & Co analyst Helane Becker said that FedEx’s results for the current would be hurt by the strong dollar and oil’s recent rebound in prices. “These are temporary problems that will affect FedEx’s (fourth quarter) results and are unrelated to the improving core business,” she wrote. FedEx said package volumes in its international economy business rose 4 percent, while daily volumes in its U.S. ground package delivery business increased 7 percent. Revenue in the express business was flat at $6.66 billion due to lower fuel surcharges and the stronger U.S. dollar. But revenue at the U.S. ground package delivery and freight units rose 12 percent and 6 percent, respectively. FedEx shares were down nearly 2 percent at $172.28.

The S&P; utilities sector, which helped lead gains on Monday, was the biggest drag on the S&P; 500, closing down 1.1 percent.

Shares of FedEx rose 2.7 percent to $171.16 as it seeks to buy Dutch package delivery company TNT Express for $4.8 billion.  Two years ago, competition regulators blocked United Parcel Service’s bid for TNT because, unlike FedEx, that suitor already had a strong European network.

General Motors shares fell 2.5 percent to $35.73 and the stock was among the day’s most active after Canada agreed to sell nearly 73.4 million shares of the automaker to Goldman Sachs. Other decliners included shares of Viacom, which fell 1.9 percent to $67.28 after it halted its $20 billion repurchase program as it embarks on a restructuring that includes cutting jobs and reorganizing three of its domestic network groups.

331,FDX,"U.S. dollar rallies, eroding Wall Street gains","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose more than 1 percent on Tuesday, resuming a recent upward trend and weighing on Wall Street stocks as investors fretted the currency’s strength would hurt multinational corporate profits. U.S. equities had traded higher for much of the session but turned negative in the final hour of trading. European shares ended sharply higher, as did crude oil. Recent market activity has favored risk assets, a move tied to Friday’s weaker-than-expected U.S. payrolls report. While the data, along with other recent indicators, pointed to slowing U.S. growth, market participants viewed them positively, as they suggested the U.S. Federal Reserve would delay its first interest rate increase in nearly a decade.  The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 1.22 percent on Tuesday. Until recently, the dollar had rallied sharply on increased expectations for higher rates from the U.S. central bank, although those expectations have dimmed somewhat of late.   While a strong U.S. dollar is a sign of solid fundamentals, analysts are concerned that the currency will weigh on the earnings of U.S. multinational companies. Bank of America-Merrill Lynch on Tuesday cut its 2015 earnings estimates for the S&P; 500 by $2 a share, citing the foreign exchange headwind. “If the (dollar) move is gradual it shouldn’t impact stocks too much, as companies will have a chance to hedge against the impact, but a sharp rise will have an impact,” said Tony Roth, chief investment officer of Wilmington Trust in Wilmington, Delaware. It “acts as a natural brake to the U.S., and we expect it will continue to strengthen.” The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.43 points, or 0.03 percent, to 17,875.42, the S&P; 500 lost 4.29 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,076.33 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.08 points, or 0.14 percent, to 4,910.23. The MSCI International ACWI Price Index slipped 0.16 percent. The S&P; 500 rose as much as 0.4 percent earlier in the session, boosted by FedEx Corp’s offer to buy TNT Express for $4.8 billion, the latest in a series of multi-billion-dollar deals that suggest companies continue to see value. The potential trans-Atlantic takeover supported European shares, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst index of leading 300 shares closing 1.6 percent higher. Europe, which was closed Monday for Easter, was also fueled by comments from Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, who on Sunday said the country intended “to meet all obligations to all its creditors, ad infinitum,” seeking to quell fears of a default. The euro fell 1 percent while the yen lost 0.7 percent against the dollar. Bucking the U.S. dollar’s strength, the Australian dollar rose 0.54 percent after the country’s central bank surprised some by leaving interest rates at a record low 2.25 percent.  The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 4/32 in price, pushing the yield down to 1.8865 percent. In commodities, U.S. crude oil futures jumped 3.5 percent to settle at $53.98 per barrel, recovering from an earlier drop of more than 2 percent and building on a rise of more than 6 percent on Monday. Prices were boosted by U.S. government forecasts of lower domestic crude production growth, higher global demand for oil and data showing a jump in U.S. job openings. Brent crude rose 1.7 percent to settle at $59.10 per barrel. Gold prices fell 0.4 percent as the dollar rebounded. Silver lost 0.7 percent while copper rose 1.4 percent.

Shares of FedEx rose 2.7 percent to $171.16 as it seeks to buy Dutch package delivery company TNT Express  for $4.8 billion. Two years ago, competition regulators blocked United Parcel Service’s bid for TNT because, unlike FedEx, that suitor already had a strong European network. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.43 points, or 0.03 percent, to 17,875.42, the S&P; 500 lost 4.29 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,076.33 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 7.08 points, or 0.14 percent, to 4,910.23. While a strong U.S. dollar is a sign of solid fundamentals, analysts are concerned that the currency will weigh on the earnings of U.S. multinational companies. Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Tuesday cut its 2015 earnings estimates for the S&P; 500 by $2 a share, citing the foreign exchange headwind. General Motors shares fell 2.5 percent to $35.73 and the stock was among the day’s most active after Canada agreed to sell nearly 73.4 million shares of the automaker to Goldman Sachs. Other decliners included shares of Viacom, which fell 1.9 percent to $67.28 after it halted its $20 billion repurchase program as it embarks on a restructuring that includes cutting jobs and reorganizing three of its domestic network groups. Shares of Twitter jumped 4 percent to $52.87 and hit their highest in six months following a Barron’s report that the company has hired advisers to fend off a takeover bid. Informatica Corp jumped 4.3 percent to $47.79 after the enterprise software provider said it would be taken private by Permira Advisers and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,699 to 1,352, for a 1.26-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,457 issues fell and 1,267 advanced for a 1.15-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.

334,FDX,FedEx to buy TNT for $4.8 billion to take on rivals in Europe,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N) is to buy Dutch package delivery firm TNT Express TNTE.AS for an agreed 4.4 billion euros ($4.8 billion), stepping up the challenge to rivals United Parcel Service (UPS.N) and Deutsche Post (DPWGn.DE) in Europe. European regulators blocked a 2013 takeover of TNT by UPS due to concerns it would stifle competition, but analysts and executives said on Tuesday FedEx, with its strong air fleet, would complement TNT’s sizeable European road network. “Europe, despite the fact that there has been low growth, is still an enormous market both for import and export,” FedEx Corp. (FDX.N) Chief Executive Fred Smith told analysts. TNT gives FedEx access to pan-European service and the domestic UK and French markets, areas where it is not yet a big player, Smith said, while TNT customers will get access to FedEx’s global distribution platform. ING analysts estimate Deutsche Post’s DHL currently has a 19 percent market share in Europe, followed by UPS with 16 percent, TNT with 12 percent and FedEx at 5 percent — meaning the deal could catapult FedEx to second place. FedEx will offer 8 euros in cash per ordinary TNT share — a 33 percent premium on last week’s close, though below UPS’s 2013 offer of 9.5 euros.  Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx is financing the deal with debt, the latest company to take advantage of low interest rates. TNT shares were up nearly 30 percent on Tuesday, close to FedEx’s bid price, while FedEx stock rose 3.6 percent. “FedEx has laid on the table an attractive offer price,” said ABN Amro analyst Maarten Bakker, who has a “hold” rating on TNT shares.  “With FedEx having always been the most logical predator of TNT Express, we see the chances of a competing offer as slim.” FedEx finance chief Alan Graf said the company would “be very aggressive on spending on integration in the first year,” and the deal would create unspecified cost synergies. The deal has been unanimously recommended by TNT’s supervisory board. TNT’s largest shareholder, PostNL (PTNL.AS), also said it would tender its 14.7 percent stake to FedEx. PostNL shares rose 17 percent. European regulators’ decision to block UPS’s bid for TNT dealt a blow to the Dutch firm, which had been counting on adopting much of UPS’s logistics backbone.  TNT, whose European market share has slumped by as much as 5 percentage points since that deal fell apart, has cut costs, sold operations and invested in its road network in an effort to hold on to customers in a weak European market for business package deliveries. “There is no regulatory risk whatsoever,” said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Andre Mulder of the proposed FedEx deal, calling the offer fair in view of TNT’s weaker market position. “FedEx made a smart move and their rivals can do virtually nothing,” he added. FedEx’s decision to bid followed a 17 percent drop in TNT shares over the past year, versus a 21 percent rise in the benchmark Dutch AEX index. A stronger U.S. dollar against the euro will also have worked in the U.S. firm’s favor.  TNT warned in February it expected tough trading to continue in its main western European markets.

336,FDX,"In TNT, FedEx may get last major package target UPS once sought","CHICAGO, April 7 (Reuters) - FedEx Corp’s $4.8 billion bid Tuesday for TNT Express took the world’s last large potential package delivery acquisition target off the table, marking a victory in FedEx’s battle to gain market share from rival United Parcel Service Inc. If FedEx wins regulatory approval for the proposed acquisition, it would pull into the No. 2 spot among package delivery services in Europe with a 17 percent market share. That would put it ahead of UPS in Europe, but leave Deutsche Post’s  DHL with the lead at 19 percent of the market. For FedEx, this is a case where being No. 2 could be an advantage. In 2013, European regulators blocked a $6.9 billion bid from Atlanta-based UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, for TNT on grounds that the combined companies would have more than 30 percent of the European market. FedEx has a better shot at getting regulatory approval, analysts say, in part because TNT has lost share since the UPS bid. “It looks like FedEx came in and got something that UPS couldn’t,” said John Haber, chief executive of Spend Management Experts, which helps clients reduce supply chain spending. “It looks like FedEx paid a lot less and it puts them in a sweet position.” UPS has said it will not renew its bid for TNT and last year said it would invest $1 billion over four years in expansion projects to grow its business organically. FedEx has had a good run recently against UPS. UPS had a second consecutive poor peak season in 2014, as it overspent to compensate for being stuck with a glut of packages on Christmas Eve 2013. FedEx experienced no such problems. “FedEx is currently better positioned and is doing a better job of executing,” said Jim Corridore, an equity research director at S&P; Capital IQ. If regulators give FedEx’s TNT offer the nod, it would leave no other major package delivery firm as targets for DHL, UPS or FedEx, which have global market shares of 41 percent, 25 percent and up to 22 percent, including TNT, respectively. “There’s really nothing juicy left out there to buy,” said Helane Becker, a Cowen & Co analyst. Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker said acquisitions by the two package delivery firms from now on may focus on growing other parts of their business, such as contract logistics, logistics or freight forwarding. “Unless a large package business develops independently in Asia, all that’s left out there are small, regional players,” Schoonmaker said. The barriers to entry for a major new package delivery company are high. A potential rival to the three global leaders would need to own an airline, a prohibitive obstacle for most firms.

Shares in BG Group rose as much as 42 percent in early trade after Royal Dutch Shell agreed to pay that amount (47 billion pounds) for its smaller rival, making it the biggest deal in the sector in more than a decade. Germany was the main exception, where shares slipped after data showed that industrial orders surprisingly fell in February. In early trading Europe’s EuroFirst 300 index of leading shares was up 0.3 percent at 1,617 points. This followed Tuesday’s 1.6 percent rise, the market’s biggest gain since Jan. 23. Britain’s FTSE 100, of which energy shares are a major component, was up 0.6 percent at 7,002 points. Shares in Shell fell more than 2 percent but BP was up more than 4 percent. “We have been buying the oil majors over the last couple of weeks. There is a bit of weakness in Shell this morning due to the very high premium that Shell is offering, but in the long-term, this does look like creating a business that will be well-positioned within the energy sector,” said Dafydd Davies, partner at Charles Hanover Investments. Elsewhere, Vivendi is looking at a possible acquisition of pay-TV group Sky, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, in a deal that could cost the French media conglomerate up to 28 billion pounds. Following FedEx Corp’s 4.4 billion euro ($4.8 billion) bid to buy Dutch package delivery company TNT Express  on Tuesday, investors shunned the temptation to cash in on a decent run for Europe’s main indexes in recent days. Earlier in Asia, Japanese stocks rose 0.8 percent to a fresh 15-year high after the Bank of Japan’s latest policy meeting. Some investors were disappointed no fresh stimulus was announced, but with inflation near zero expectations are high that more will come at its next meeting. Hong Kong and Chinese markets both hit seven-year peaks, while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 1.2 percent to its highest since mid-September. Futures pointed to a higher open on Wall Street too. In currency markets the dollar took a breather after rising more than 1 percent on Tuesday, its biggest gain in almost a month. The euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.0870, sterling was up 0.6 percent at $1.4895 and the dollar slipped a third of one percent against the yen to 119.86 yen. Markets continue to readjust expectations on the timing of the Federal Reserve’s first interest rate rise since June 2006. Last Friday’s weak jobs report for March prompted many observers to strike June off as a potential date for “lift-off”. Minutes from the Fed’s last policy meeting released later on Wednesday will be scrutinised closely for clues on the timing. Reflecting the uncertainty, Goldman Sachs economists said they are sticking with September but admit December is an increasingly “close call”. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was one basis point lower on Wednesday at 1.87 percent, while the comparable German yield was two basis points lower at 0.16 percent after the 0.9 percent fall in German industrial orders in February. European bond traders will also pay close attention to demand at Germany’s two-year, zero percent bond auction later on Wednesday, and headlines from Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s visit to Russia. Athens has not asked Moscow for financial aid, a Greek government spokesman said on Wednesday, a day before Greece is due to due to repay a loan tranche of around 450 million euros to the International Monetary Fund. In commodities, oil pared recent gains after Saudi Arabia reported record production of 10.3 million barrels per day in March, a figure the country’s oil minister said was unlikely to fall by much. U.S. May crude fell 2.5 percent to $52.71 a barrel while Brent shed 1.6 percent to $58.14. Gold got a boost from the weaker dollar and edged up a couple of bucks to $1,210 an ounce.

341,FDX,UPS CFO - Europe plans unchanged by possible TNT deal,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Package delivery giant UPS does not expect to change its current expansion plan in Europe despite a recent acquisition bid by main rival FedEx that would knock the firm into third place on the continent, a top executive said on Tuesday. Last year UPS announced a four-year, $1 billion investment to grow its European network.  Earlier this month, its main rival, FedEx Corp (FDX.N), announced it would buy Dutch package delivery firm TNT Express TNTE.AS. A 2013 UPS bid to buy TNT was blocked by European regulators. If FedEx’s acquisition of TNT is approved, it would become the second-largest package delivery firm in Europe behind Deutsche Post’s (DPWGn.DE) DHL but ahead of UPS. Speaking after UPS posted a better-than-expected quarterly net profit and reaffirmed its 2015 earnings outlook, chief financial officer Kurt Kuehn told Reuters that FedEx’s bid for TNT had not changed UPS’ plans. “We’re continuing at full speed with our expansions plans,” said Kuehn, who is due to retire this summer. “Actually Europe was one of the stars of the show in the (first) quarter.” Export volumes in Europe at UPS rose over 9 percent in the quarter and Kuehn said the company’s compound annual growth over the past decade has also been around 9 percent.  “We’re going to keep on doing what we can to compete in that environment,” he said. While many publicly traded companies have complained about the impact of the strong dollar as overseas sales in foreign currencies translate into lower revenue at home, UPS said it had hedges in place on major currencies that should protect it until the end of 2016.  But Kuehn said that UPS is unprotected in minor currencies, which should be a slight drag for the company this year. At the start of 2015 UPS expected that would affect revenue by $50 million this year, but it now puts that figure at $70 million. What UPS is more concerned about moving forward is the impact of the strong dollar on U.S. exports, Kuehn said. Although he said it was hard to predict exactly how much its U.S. customers would be affected, the strength of the dollar would continue to act as a headwind for exports, he said.

FedEx said it recorded charges of 47 cents per share, net of tax, in its fourth quarter ended May 31 related to the settlement. The ground package delivery business is the company’s second largest after FedEx Express and accounts for more than a quarter of its total revenue. Shares of FedEx, which is scheduled to report quarterly results on June 17, were little changed at $184.14 on Friday. Up to Thursday’s close, they had risen nearly 7 percent this year.

352,FDX,US STOCKS-Wall St ends higher in choppy post-Fed trading,"* Fed says economy strong enough to handle rate hike * Oracle slides after the bell on revenue miss * FedEx down after results * Indexes up: Dow 0.17 pct, S&P; 0.2 pct, Nasdaq 0.18 pct   (Updates to close) By Rodrigo Campos June 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended slightly higher following a choppy session Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said the U.S. economy is likely strong enough to withstand an interest rate hike later this year. Even if a majority of Fed officials continue to see higher rates by the end of 2015, they expect rates to rise slightly less by the end of 2016 and 2017 than they did in their March forecasts. That view on rates saw high-yielding stocks gain, with the S&P; 500 utilities sector up 0.9 percent after hitting on Tuesday its lowest since late September. Stocks with higher dividend yields attract investors when there is an expectation that Treasury yields will fall, or in this case, remain relatively low. “The Fed is talking about the labor market tightening somewhat, which seems to be a hint that it is a step closer to raising rates. At the same time, it seems like there was a notching down of the magnitude of rate hike expectations,” said Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at Invesco PowerShares in Downers Grove, Illinois. “Those two things are what is causing stocks to go back and forth.” Major indexes were volatile following the Fed statement. Stocks initially added to losses, then hit session highs as Fed Chair Janet Yellen spoke to the media in a follow-up to the statement. They lost more than half the day’s gains at the close. The S&P; 500 has hovered near the 2,100 level for more than a month as sentiment shifts between hopes for a stronger economy and fears of the effect of rising rates coupled with high valuations. At the closing bell on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 31.26 points, or 0.17 percent, to 17,935.74, the S&P; 500 gained 4.15 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,100.44 and the Nasdaq Composite added 9.33 points, or 0.18 percent, to 5,064.88. At its session high, the S&P; had been up 0.5 percent. Adding to support for equities, investors have seen the proximity of rising rates as a trigger for more M&A; activity, with mergers and acquisitions already at record levels. Away from the Fed, FedEx fell 3 percent to $176.73 after the package delivery firm reported a quarterly net loss. Oracle shares fell nearly 7 percent in after-hours trading after the enterprise software and computer hardware company missed revenue expectations. During regular market hours, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,606 to 1,446, for a 1.11-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,441 issues fell and 1,301 advanced for a 1.11-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The S&P; 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 145 new highs and 34 new lows. About 6.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 5.94 billion daily average so far this month, according to BATS Global Markets.

353,FDX,"FedEx swings to quarterly net loss, weighed by pensions","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Package delivery company FedEx Corp (FDX.N) on Wednesday posted a fiscal fourth-quarter net loss of $895 million, weighed by pension costs, a stronger dollar and lower fuel surcharges. FedEx shares fell more than 3 percent following the announcement. It said the loss, compared with a year-earlier profit of $780 million, included a non-cash pretax charge of $2.2 billion due to a move to mark-to-market accounting, announced last week, for employee pensions. The company added that unfavorable exchange rates due to the strong dollar also weighed on earnings at its most profitable international segment, as did falling fuel surcharges.  Like other shippers, FedEx levies surcharges as fuel prices rise. As the price of oil comes back down, so do the surcharges which curbs  revenue. “It’s clear just how critical Fuel Surcharge revenues are to FedEx overall revenues as this was a major contributor to FedEx missing both earnings and revenue guidance for their fourth quarter,” said John Haber, chief executive of Spend Management Experts, which helps companies manage shipping costs, adding that surcharges will continue to weigh on FedEx earnings this year.  The Memphis-based company reported an adjusted net profit for the fiscal fourth quarter ending May 31 of $753 million or $2.66 per share, unchanged from $753 million or $2.54 per share a year earlier.  Analysts had expected earnings per share of $2.68 for the quarter.   In the fiscal fourth quarter, the net loss was $3.16 per share compared with $2.62 profit per share a year earlier. The company reported revenue for the quarter of $12.1 billion versus $11.8 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $12.3 billion.  FedEx said that for the fiscal year 2016 it expects earnings in the range of $10.60 to $11.10 per share. Analysts have forecast full-year earnings of $10.88.

The deal is awaiting approval by European regulators and the company said the cost of the deal is not included in its earnings outlook. European regulators blocked a 2013 takeover of TNT by FedEx’s main rival United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) due to concerns it would stifle competition, but analysts say that the combined size of FedEx and TNT in Europe would not threaten competition.

363,FDX,FedEx orders 50 Boeing freighters in deal worth $9.97 billion at list prices,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the world’s largest cargo firm, has signed a deal to buy 50 additional Boeing Co (BA.N) 767-300 freighters in the biggest order ever for the plane, allowing the aircraft maker to extend its production line well into the next decade. The deal, announced in a statement by the U.S. cargo operator, includes options for another 50 767Fs and is worth $9.97 billion at list prices. Customers typically receive an undisclosed discount off the list prices. FedEx said the aircraft will be delivered by Boeing for its FedEx Express arm over the fiscal years 2018-2023. The latest deal brings FedEx’s firm orders for 767Fs to 106 and extends the company’s drive to modernize its fleet. “Acquiring additional 767F aircraft...will enable us to reduce structural costs, improve our fuel efficiency and enhance the reliability of our global network,” David J. Bronczek, president and chief executive officer of FedEx Express, said in the statement. The air cargo business has remained soft compared to the general aviation business since the 2008 global financial crisis. Weak demand, overcapacity and competition from the belly space of passenger planes has driven down yields and reduced the need for dedicated freighters.

The fourth-largest global logistics firm, which in April agreed to be taken over by larger U.S. rival FedEx for $4.8 billion, said it still expected 2015 to be a difficult year, marked by restructuring costs and major investments in logistics facilities around the world. “We are achieving good growth in the SME customer segment after years of decline,” said Chief Executive Tex Gunning in a statement on Monday. “We have experienced some positive developments in Western Europe, but we remain cautious given the economic volatility in China, Brazil, Australia and Greece.” Revenues were up 6.2 percent at 1.8 billion euros ($1.98 billion), higher than the 1.7 billion euros expected by analysts polled by Reuters. That was helped by revenue boost from a stronger dollar, though lower fuel surcharges were a headwind. The company made operating income of 19 million euros.

373,FDX,New U.S. airline group backs Gulf carriers in Open Skies dispute,"Aug 3 (Reuters) - A challenge by U.S. airlines that accuses three Gulf carriers of distorting competition via government subsidies took another turn on Monday with the formation of a U.S. airline group that backs the Gulf-carriers’ cause. Four long-time supporters of U.S. Open Skies agreements with Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, which remove restrictions on flying to and from those states, have formally banded together to create the U.S. Airlines for Open Skies Coalition. They are the air cargo unit of FedEx Corp, JetBlue Airways Corp , Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc and Hawaiian Holdings Inc. “We thought it was important that the government understand that there are many different voices in this choir,” JetBlue’s general counsel, James Hnat, told reporters Monday in announcing  a letter from the group to the Obama administration. The letter comes just hours before the U.S. government closes a public comment period on Aug. 3 asking for views on whether Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways have dumped capacity and begun pushing competitors out of key markets via $42 billion in subsidies over the past decade. Each Gulf carrier has denied the subsidy claims. A coalition representing American Airlines Group Inc , Delta Air Lines Inc, United Continental Holdings Inc and seven airline unions - known as the Partnership for Open and Fair Skies - has called on the Obama administration to initiate consultations with the Gulf states to address the alleged subsidies. The Partnership’s spokeswoman, Jill Zuckman, called the new U.S. group “a meaningless coalition without a cause.” A majority of comments submitted to the U.S. government have backed the Partnership, according to the group. The carriers in the new coalition have benefited from the Open Skies agreements in question: for example, FedEx Express has a hub in Dubai, and JetBlue has seen a boost in passenger traffic from a relationship with Emirates that feeds the New York-based airline many international customers.

382,FDX,"In North Korea, deals on the bus make markets go round","SEOUL (Reuters) - It’s not Amazon or FedEx, but in North Korea’s fledgling market economy a fleet of repurposed old passenger buses is the next best thing for moving trade goods, from rice to textiles and livestock, between far-flung corners of the country. Known as “servi-cha” - the name comes from “service” and “car” - the money-making buses have been transporting goods in recent years in what satellite imagery shows is an increasingly robust, if still primitive, network. “In the past you had to deliver stuff in person. Now, buses are the way it is,” said Kim Heung-kwang, a defector who heads the North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity organization in Seoul and maintains links with sources inside his secretive homeland. “Rice can be sent ... cattle move around with these buses.

383,FDX,"In North Korea, deals on the bus make markets go round","(This is part of a series of Reuters stories on how life is changing in North Korea) By Ju-min Park and James Pearson SEOUL, Sept 11 (Reuters) - It’s not Amazon or FedEx, but in North Korea’s fledgling market economy a fleet of repurposed old passenger buses is the next best thing for moving trade goods, from rice to textiles and livestock, between far-flung corners of the country. Known as “servi-cha” - the name comes from “service” and “car” - the money-making buses have been transporting goods in recent years in what satellite imagery shows is an increasingly robust, if still primitive, network. “In the past you had to deliver stuff in person. Now, buses are the way it is,” said Kim Heung-kwang, a defector who heads the North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity organisation in Seoul and maintains links with sources inside his secretive homeland. “Rice can be sent ... cattle move around with these buses. Raw materials can now be delivered around the country.” The servi-cha are another example of a growing tolerance for private enterprise within North Korea, where informal markets and small trading firms have burgeoned in recent years alongside a creaking centrally-planned Soviet-style economy.

384,FDX,"FedEx profit misses expectations, lowers earnings forecast","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Package delivery company FedEx Corp (FDX.N) posted a higher quarterly profit on Wednesday, but missed Wall Street expectations due to weak global economic conditions and the strong U.S. dollar.	 The Memphis-based company also lowered its full-year earnings forecast, citing modest economic growth and higher-than-expected operating costs plus self-insurance reserves at its ground domestic U.S. package unit. It also sees weaker demand for its less-than-truckload business, in which operators fill trucks with smaller orders from multiple customers as opposed to regular trucking firms that haul full loads for single customers. The news sent FedEx shares down more than 2 percent. Often considered a bellwether of U.S. economic activity, FedEx said it now expects earnings per share for the fiscal 2016 year ending May 31 next year in a range from $10.40 to $10.90 before year-end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments. The company had previously forecast full-year earnings per share  of $10.60 to $11.10.  Analysts have on average predicted full-year earnings per share of $10.82.  “We remain focused on executing our profit improvement program, leveraging e-commerce growth and enhancing our revenue quality,” Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf said in a statement. FedEx reported a net profit for its fiscal 2016 first quarter ending Aug. 31 of $692 million or $2.42 per share, up 6 percent from $653 million or $2.26 per share a year earlier. Analysts had on average expected earnings per share of $2.46.  FedEx said its U.S. domestic package business revenue rose 29 percent, but freight unit revenue was flat and was down 4 percent in its international package unit due to the strong U.S. dollar and lower fuel surcharge revenue. The company reported revenue for the quarter of $12.3 billion versus $11.7 billion a year earlier, in line with analyst estimates.  FedEx said its planned fiscal 2016 capital expenditures remain unchanged at $4.6 billion. The company said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.5 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2016, led by consumer spending. Executives said on a conference call with analysts FedEx expects a record peak holiday season this year and will hire up to 55,000 seasonal workers. Last year the company said it would hire up to 50,000 workers for the peak season. On Tuesday, main rival United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) said it would hire up to 95,000 workers to handle the holiday surge in packages. In early trading, FedEx shares were down 2.6 percent at $149.86.

With a European market share of 17 percent, the combined company would be Europe’s second-biggest delivery services business, behind Deutsche Post’s DHL but ahead of UPS. The deal would also strengthen FedEx’s position as the world’s No.3 player. TNT shares jumped 10 percent to 7.55 euros, the biggest gainers in the STOXX Europe 600 Industrial Goods and Services index, after Reuters cited sources saying unconditional EU approval was imminent. It was the biggest rise in the stock since April, when the takeover was announced. Shares in PostNL, which owns just under 15 pct of TNT Express according to Thomson Reuters data, rose 8.3 percent. “FedEx and TNT have been informed by the European Commission that no statement of objections will be issued,” the companies said in a joint statement. “FedEx and TNT continue to expect that the offer will close in the first half of ... 2016.”  Prospects for a reduction in the number of European players from four to three had triggered a full-scale investigation by the European Commission on July 31, because of concern that the deal could reduce competition and result in higher prices. The EU antitrust enforcer subsequently made a price analysis to help it decide whether to send a so-called statement of objections or charge sheet listing problematic issues to FedEx. Such moves usually ratchet up the pressure on companies to offer concessions unless they can convince regulators otherwise. A decision not to send a charge sheet usually means regulators do not see serious competition issues. Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso declined comment. The EU executive is scheduled to announce its decision by Jan. 13. UPS had sought to buy TNT in 2012, but the bid was scuppered by the Commission because the combined company would have controlled more than 30 percent of the European market.

393,FDX,FedEx profit beats forecasts as margins rise; shares jump,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Package delivery company FedEx Corp (FDX.N) on Wednesday reported a better-than-expected quarterly net profit, saying higher margins, cost-cutting and a lower effective tax rate offset weak industrial production and global trade.  The news sent FedEx stock up 5 percent in after-market trading.  Often seen as a bellwether of U.S. economic activity, Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx reiterated its fiscal 2016 earnings forecast between $10.40 and $10.90 per share. The company reported adjusted net income for its fiscal second quarter ended Nov. 30 of $729 million, or $2.58 per share, up 17 percent from $622 million, or $2.16 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had on average expected earnings for the fiscal second quarter of $2.51 a share. FedEx said its adjusted earnings per share reflected one-off expenses of 9 cents a share related to settling litigation over its use of independent contractors as drivers at FedEx Ground and 4 cents related to its pending acquisition of Dutch package deliver company TNT Express NV TNTE.AS. During a conference call with analysts, executives said the company expects to receive “final, unconditional approval” from the European Union for its takeover bid for TNT in the second half of January. FedEx expects to complete the acquisition of the Dutch carrier in the first half of 2016. FedEx “posted solid earnings despite continued weakness in industrial production and global trade, and we are making impressive progress toward our goals to increase margins, earnings per share, cash flows, and returns on invested capital,” Chief Executive Frederick Smith said in a statement. Revenue for the quarter totaled $12.5 billion, up from $11.9 billion a year earlier.  The company said revenue at its more lucrative international segment fell 6 percent to $6.59 billion from $7.02 billion, which it said stemmed in part from the strong U.S. dollar.

Arch rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) experienced problems on a smaller scale.    Last year, UPS spent $500 million, boosted seasonal hiring and worked with retailers to forecast package volumes that failed to materialize and overspending hurt fourth-quarter earnings. FedEx did not experience problems that year. This year UPS focused on what spokesman Steve Gaut described as a “disciplined approach” to peak season, that included pulling delivery dates forward on days when it had excess capacity in its network and informing retailers of hard cutoff dates for packages to make it by Christmas using UPS’ cheaper ground delivery service.  As a result, many retailers informed customers free shipping would end the week before Christmas - as shipping by air would be too expensive. Noelle Sadler, chief marketing officer at online clothing retailer LuLu’s, said the firm stopped free shipping over a week before the holidays because it was “hamstrung by UPS and have to follow their rules.”  UPS network was snarled up for about a week after Black Friday particularly in California, Texas and the Northeast, but focused its resources to catch up, spokesman Gaut said.

The company’s on-time rate on a normal day, when daily package volumes are around half those during peak, is between 98 percent and 99 percent.

400,FDX,"U.S. judge dismisses FedEx billing fraud, racketeering lawsuit","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday dismissed a federal racketeering lawsuit claiming FedEx Corp overcharged customers by inflating package weights, and wrongly collecting customs duties on products sent to Canada from shippers instead of recipients. U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan said the FedEx Ground unit that imposed the charges was not “sufficiently distinct” from its parent and another unit to justify holding all three liable for violating the federal anti-racketeering law known as RICO. NYBikerGear, a Putnam Valley, New York-based online seller of motorcycle apparel and accessories, claimed it was overcharged more than 150 times through inflated package weights, and a similar number through improper customs charges, according to court papers. In a 21-page decision, Forrest said the fact that FedEx Ground was incorporated separately and based in a Pittsburgh suburb, while FedEx and its FedEx Corporate Services unit were based in Memphis, Tennessee, did not matter in the racketeering context, or affect NYBikerGear’s dealings with the company. “If plaintiff’s theory of RICO distinctness were accepted, it would transform every routine allegation of fraud involving a company that uses the routine holding company/subsidiary structure at issue here into a RICO claim,” Forrest wrote. “That is not and should not be the law.” The plaintiff, which is also known as U1it4less Inc, had sought triple damages for customers since 2007 over the alleged inflated weights, and since 2008 over the customs charges. It sued in March 2011. Another judge had dismissed other claims. Michael Paleudis, a lawyer for the plaintiff, declined to comment. FedEx, in a statement, said it is pleased with the decision, and that the plaintiff’s allegations were unfounded. It is common for FedEx and rival United Parcel Service Inc, which together command much of the U.S. express package delivery market, to be accused of overcharges by customers. RICO is short for the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. It is most commonly associated with organized crime prosecutions. The case is U1it4less Inc v.

405,FDX,TNT to sell airlines to meet EU rules after FedEx acquisition,"AMSTERDAM, Feb 5 (Reuters) - TNT Express will sell its airline operations to ASL Aviation Group to comply with European Union rules if the Dutch logistics company’s sale to larger rival FedEx goes ahead, the company said on Friday. The company said it needed to sell TNT Airways and Pan Air Lineas Aereas to comply with EU airline ownership and control roles after FedEx’s 4.4 billion euro ($4.90 billion) acquisition of the company. Under EU rules, foreign investors cannot own more than 49 percent of a European airline and control of the company must remain in EU hands. Ireland-based ASL, a global cargo, passenger and leasing company, will continue to operate flights for TNT following its acquisition by FedEx under a multi-year service agreement. Its fleet will grow from 90 to 130 aircraft after the sale. With a European market share of 17 percent, the combined FedEx-TNT will be Europe’s second-biggest delivery services business, behind Deutsche Post’s DHL but ahead of UPS . The deal also strengthens FedEx’s position as the world’s No.3 player. FedEx and TNT Express said last month they had obtained unconditional approval from the European Commission for their proposed merger.

407,FDX,UPDATE 3-Amazon to start air delivery network with leasing deal,"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) said on Wednesday it had signed a deal to lease 20 Boeing (BA.N) 767 widebody freighter aircraft to handle more of its own deliveries in the United States. The deal comes at a time when the world’s biggest online retailer is offering ever-faster, and increasingly free, deliveries for millions of online orders. Amazon, which relies on carriers like United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) to deliver most of its packages, spent $11.5 billion on shipping last year. In a bid to assume more control over its supply chain and reduce costs, Amazon has rolled out thousands of trailers and launched a program that uses contract drivers to deliver fast orders. But analysts said the long-rumored plan to build its own air fleet posed little threat to the leading delivery companies. “This is an incremental negative for FDX and UPS as it will likely remove some higher yielding express freight and parcel volume from each of the respective networks,” RBC Capital Markets analyst John Barnes wrote in a client note. UPS, the world’s No. 1 package delivery company, operates about 240 large planes while FedEx has a fleet of about 370, Barnes noted. FedEx and UPS shares were down about 1.5 percent. FedEx said on Wednesday the announcement was not a surprise and called Amazon a valuable customer. “We work closely with Amazon and have been aware for some time about their need for supplemental air capacity related to inventory management,” said Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of integrated marketing and communications at FedEx.  The leased planes will start to go into operation on April 1, Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said in an email. Amazon has been testing deliveries by drones but has not said when they would be in service. The duration of the leases will be five to seven years, lessor Air Transport Services Group Inc (ATSG.O) said. As part of the agreement, Amazon has the right to buy up to 19.9 percent of ATSG’s stock over five years at $9.73 per share. ATSG’s stock soared almost 27 percent to a record high of $14.90, before paring gains to about 16 percent.

409,FDX,Robust FedEx fiscal 2016 outlook sends stock up 5.0 percent,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Package delivery company FedEx Corp (FDX.N) forecast better than expected full year earnings and reported fiscal third quarter earnings that also beat analysts expectations, sending its stock up 5.0 percent in after-hours trade on Wednesday. The Memphis-based freight forwarder gave its forecast while posting quarterly results that reflected costs related to its pending acquisition of Dutch package company TNT TNTE.AS and a legal case over FedEx Ground drivers.  Excluding those costs, FedEx recorded a strong performance during the quarter, despite some problems delivering packages in time for Christmas during its key holiday period.  “FedEx has demonstrated once again that it knows how to run an efficient operation during peak season,” said Logan Purk, an analyst at Edward Jones. “The strong results coupled with a robust outlook bodes well for the stock.” FedEx reported net income for its fiscal third quarter ending Feb. 29 of $507 million or $1.84 per share, down nearly 20 percent from $628 million or $2.18 a share a year earlier. Excluding those one-time items, the company reported a profit of $692 million or earnings per share of $2.51. Analysts on average had expected earnings per share on that basis for the quarter of $2.34. Revenue rose 9.0 percent to $12.7 billion from $11.7 billion, driven in a large part by a 30 percent jump in revenue at its FedEx Ground unit to $4.41 billion from $3.39 billion a year earlier. FedEx said it expects its full-year fiscal 2016 earnings to fall within a range of $10.70 to $10.90 per share. The company said that forecast was based on an assumption of moderate economic growth and excludes legal issues as well as any TNT-related costs or operating results. Analysts had previously forecast earnings per share of $10.52 for the full year.  The European Commission approved FedEx’s 4.4 billion euro ($4.8 billion) bid for TNT in January. FedEx made the bid in April 2015 and the deal should move FedEx to second place in Europe behind Deutsche Post’s (DPWGn.DE) DHL. The European Commission had rejected an earlier bid for TNT from FedEx’s main rival United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) on the grounds that a merger would harm competition in the European Union.  During the third quarter, FedEx settled all cases related to its independent contractor model at FedEx Ground. The company recognized a liability for the net expected loss of $204 million related to these cases.  In after-market trading FedEx shares were up 5.0 percent at $151.50.

411,FDX,FedEx shares could rise 15-20 percent over next year: Barron's,"(Reuters) - Shares of U.S. delivery services company FedEx Corp (FDX.N) could rise another 15 to 20 percent over the next year after soaring 12 percent on Thursday, Barron’s reported on Sunday. Even with last week’s gain, the stock has fallen about 8 percent over the last nine months, due in part to worries that Amazon.com (AMZN.O) was looking to enter the delivery business, the financial paper said. FedEx shares closed at $163.71 on Friday. Amazon was reportedly negotiating to lease 20 jets from Boeing Co (BA.N) in December. But analysts think Amazon will probably use the planes to shift merchandise among its distribution centers, Barron’s said. FedEx said on its earnings call last week that no customer accounted for more than 3 percent of revenue for any of its businesses, including express, ground and freight, much lower than many analysts had assumed, Barron’s said. FedEx also said more retailers were shipping to homes from stores, rather than from distribution centers, Barron’s noted. That plays into FedEx’s strength in having a vast driver network, it said. FedEx has historically traded at a discount to rival United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), Barron’s said, because ground is a more lucrative business than express and FedEx is an express specialist. But FedEx’s recent discount of 23 percent to UPS compares with an average of 13 percent over the past decade, Barron’s said, noting that the gap is expected to grow smaller.

414,FDX,FedEx fails to end New York lawsuit over illegal cigarettes,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - FedEx Corp must face a second lawsuit claiming it shipped thousands of cartons of untaxed cigarettes in New York over roughly a decade, cheating the state and New York City out of tax revenue and undercutting their efforts to curb smoking. In a decision made public on Friday, U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos in Manhattan rejected FedEx’s bid to dismiss claims by New York State and New York City that it violated a federal anti-racketeering law and the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act. Ramos said FedEx must also face claims it violated its 2006 agreement with the state, later extended nationwide, not to do business with sellers that ship cigarettes to people’s homes. He dismissed two other claims related to a state public health law. The judge rejected FedEx’s argument that its alleged dealings with shippers such as “Your Kentucky Tobacco Resource,” “Cigarettes for Less” and “Smokin’ Joes” was too far removed from the resulting financial harm. FedEx’s alleged involvement “was precisely the conduct that led to the plaintiffs’ losing tax revenue,” he wrote. “The alleged scheme’s entire purpose was to evade the City and State’s cigarette taxing regime.” A spokesman for FedEx had no immediate comment. The office of state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Eric Proshansky, a lawyer for the city, said he was pleased with the decision. The lawsuit covers Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx’s dealings with 21 shippers, including some associated with Native American tribes such as Shinnecock Indian Nation. It is separate from a lawsuit by the state and city over FedEx’s dealings with four other shippers. Ramos refused to dismiss that lawsuit in March 2015, and in a separate ruling on Friday narrowed FedEx’s defenses to some claims it raised. Both lawsuits accuse FedEx of costing the state between $15 and $43.50 per carton, and the city $15 per carton, in excise taxes through illegal cigarette shipments. A carton usually contains 10 packs. The state and city have also sued FedEx rival United Parcel Service Inc over cigarette shipments.

In a conference call with analysts, the company said it expects the U.S. economy to grow at a rate of 1.8 percent in 2016, below its previous forecast of 2.2 percent. FedEx said it expects consumer spending to lead U.S. economic growth of 2.4 percent in 2017. When asked by analysts what issues in the upcoming U.S. presidential election concern the company most, Chief Executive Fred Smith said “we have a hard time putting up a list of the things that don’t concern us giving the two candidates positions,” especially “the anti-trade rhetoric.” “Hopefully, after the election cooler heads will prevail,” he said.

Excluding charges, FedEx posted quarterly net income of $879 million, or $3.30 per share. Charges for pensions totaled $3.47 per share. TNT-related charges amounted to 34 cents per share.

433,FDX,U.S. prosecutors launch review of failed FedEx drug case,"SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice has begun a rare internal examination of what went wrong in the prosecution of a controversial drug conspiracy case against delivery service Federal Express, the department’s top prosecutor in San Francisco told Reuters. The review plays into a broader debate about how the government prosecutes suspected corporate wrongdoing and could influence its approach to such cases in the future. Prosecutors obtained a grand jury indictment against FedEx in 2014 on charges the courier service had knowingly helped Internet pharmacies ship illegal pills. But four days into a trial in San Francisco last month, the Justice Department abruptly dropped all charges. The judge commended the decision, saying it was clear FedEx was “factually innocent.” The U.S. Attorney in San Francisco, Brian Stretch, said he has assigned the office’s deputy criminal chief to a review that could take two months. It will examine why prosecutors brought the case, what oversight supervisors provided and what role officials in Washington D.C. played, Stretch said in an interview Wednesday. “This is not a finger pointing exercise,” he said. “This is an exercise with the singular purpose to find lessons learned, and apply them to current and future cases.” The outcome could hold lessons for government regulators, prosecutors and corporate defense lawyers, said Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and a former assistant U.S. Attorney. “It can impact policies not just on whether they go after individuals or organizations,” Levenson said. “It can impact how aggressive you get with the use of criminal law, as opposed to civil law or regulatory actions.” The Justice Department’s strategy in the FedEx case is one that had worked for it many times before: Call in a company suspected of wrongdoing, present it with the evidence and try to come to a settlement in exchange for not seeking criminal charges. In October 2012, DOJ officials from Northern California and Washington met with FedEx attorneys in San Francisco and presented evidence the prosecutors said showed the company had knowingly shipped illegal Internet prescriptions, according to a person who attended. The Justice Department already had wrung $500 million from Google over ads it carried for online pharmacies, and the government was in negotiations with United Parcel Service  over drug deliveries that would lead to a $40 million settlement. Key to the case against FedEx, prosecutors told company lawyers at the 2012 meeting, were internal corporate emails the government obtained by subpoena. In one, a FedEx executive wrote about online pharmacies: “It is becoming more apparent to us that many of these companies are fraudulent.” FedEx said the emails were taken out of context, according to the source at the meeting. Not only had it done no wrong, its lawyers said, the company had repeatedly told the Drug Enforcement Administration it would suspend deliveries from any pill distributor identified by investigators as engaging in illegal action. FedEx refused to settle and opted to take the case to trial. In accepting the government’s decision to drop the case last month, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer noted the company’s cooperation and said FedEx “did not have criminal intent.” FedEx’s trial lawyer, Cristina Arguedas, said a government review was essential because the Justice Department had repeatedly ignored evidence of the company’s cooperation. “This was an epic institutional failure on the part of the Department of Justice, and the department owes an explanation to the public on how this failure occurred,” she said. Stretch declined to respond. But he said he was proud of the effort, despite the result. Critics have argued that non-prosecution agreements, the type of deal the government sought in the FedEx case, unfairly burden shareholders and are ineffective deterrents against individual wrongdoing. Such settlements, which include deferred prosecution agreements, were rare in the 1990s. But after the indictment of audit firm Arthur Andersen led to its demise, companies and the government have sought to avoid trials. In recent years, the Department of Justice has negotiated 20 to 40 deferred and non-prosecution agreements annually, according to data compiled by the University of Virginia. Today, most government investigations into potential wrongdoing at large, publicly traded companies are resolved with agreements that involve fines but no criminal charges, said Brandon Garrett, a University of Virginia professor who has studied corporate prosecutions. “Hardly any corporations risk a criminal trial,” Garrett said. “The biggest companies tend to settle out of court and the small fry plead guilty.” When they are charged, most companies plead guilty and avoid trial. Of 1,795 companies sentenced in federal court between 2006 and 2014, only about 7 percent were the result of convictions at trial, according to U.S. Sentencing Commission data. The rest agreed to plea bargains. The case against FedEx grew out of a law enforcement campaign to shut down online pharmacies that supply pills to customers without verifying prescriptions. In recent years, the government broadened its scrutiny to companies that sell advertising to or deliver drugs for those pharmacies. The strategy resulted in the non-prosecution agreements with Google and United Parcel Service. In a statement this week, UPS said it “made a business decision” in 2013 to end the government investigation. Google declined to comment. Neither company faced criminal charges. After the 2014 FedEx indictment, Judge Breyer warned prosecutors in pretrial hearings that he viewed FedEx’s intent as crucial and the company’s claim that it cooperated with the DEA as an important consideration. The judge ordered prosecutors to hand over notes taken by the DEA during meetings with FedEx. They corroborated the company’s account that it had volunteered to help. Still, prosecutors moved forward, arguing in an opening statement that they would prove FedEx was “no more than part-time drug dealers.” Arguedas, the lawyer for FedEx, responded by citing many meetings with the DEA at which the company offered assistance, and noted FedEx had no way of identifying valid shipments. Ultimately, the judge said he was “critical of the decision to prosecute.” But, he added, abandoning the case was “entirely consistent with the government’s overarching obligation to seek justice even at the expense of some embarrassment.”",7152016,http://www.reuters.com/article/fedex-doj/u-s-prosecutors-launch-review-of-failed-fedex-drug-case-idUSL1N1A10C0

But four days into a trial in San Francisco last month, the Justice Department abruptly dropped all charges. The judge commended the decision, saying it was clear FedEx was “factually innocent.” The U.S. Attorney in San Francisco, Brian Stretch, said he has assigned the office’s deputy criminal chief to a review that could take two months. It will examine why prosecutors brought the case, what oversight supervisors provided and what role officials in Washington D.C. played, Stretch said in an interview Wednesday. “This is not a finger pointing exercise,” he said. “This is an exercise with the singular purpose to find lessons learned, and apply them to current and future cases.” The outcome could hold lessons for government regulators, prosecutors and corporate defense lawyers, said Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and a former assistant U.S. Attorney. “It can impact policies not just on whether they go after individuals or organizations,” Levenson said. “It can impact how aggressive you get with the use of criminal law, as opposed to civil law or regulatory actions.” The Justice Department’s strategy in the FedEx case is one that had worked for it many times before: Call in a company suspected of wrongdoing, present it with the evidence and try to come to a settlement in exchange for not seeking criminal charges. In October 2012, DOJ officials from Northern California and Washington met with FedEx attorneys in San Francisco and presented evidence the prosecutors said showed the company had knowingly shipped illegal Internet prescriptions, according to a person who attended. The Justice Department already had wrung $500 million from Google over ads it carried for online pharmacies, and the government was in negotiations with United Parcel Service  over drug deliveries that would lead to a $40 million settlement. Key to the case against FedEx, prosecutors told company lawyers at the 2012 meeting, were internal corporate emails the government obtained by subpoena. In one, a FedEx executive wrote about online pharmacies: “It is becoming more apparent to us that many of these companies are fraudulent.” FedEx said the emails were taken out of context, according to the source at the meeting. Not only had it done no wrong, its lawyers said, the company had repeatedly told the Drug Enforcement Administration it would suspend deliveries from any pill distributor identified by investigators as engaging in illegal action. FedEx refused to settle and opted to take the case to trial. In accepting the government’s decision to drop the case last month, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer noted the company’s cooperation and said FedEx “did not have criminal intent.” FedEx’s trial lawyer, Cristina Arguedas, said a government review was essential because the Justice Department had repeatedly ignored evidence of the company’s cooperation. “This was an epic institutional failure on the part of the Department of Justice, and the department owes an explanation to the public on how this failure occurred,” she said. Stretch declined to respond. But he said he was proud of the effort, despite the result. Critics have argued that non-prosecution agreements, the type of deal the government sought in the FedEx case, unfairly burden shareholders and are ineffective deterrents against individual wrongdoing. Such settlements, which include deferred prosecution agreements, were rare in the 1990s. But after the indictment of audit firm Arthur Andersen led to its demise, companies and the government have sought to avoid trials. In recent years, the Department of Justice has negotiated 20 to 40 deferred and non-prosecution agreements annually, according to data compiled by the University of Virginia. Today, most government investigations into potential wrongdoing at large, publicly traded companies are resolved with agreements that involve fines but no criminal charges, said Brandon Garrett, a University of Virginia professor who has studied corporate prosecutions. “Hardly any corporations risk a criminal trial,” Garrett said. “The biggest companies tend to settle out of court and the small fry plead guilty.” When they are charged, most companies plead guilty and avoid trial. Of 1,795 companies sentenced in federal court between 2006 and 2014, only about 7 percent were the result of convictions at trial, according to U.S. Sentencing Commission data. The rest agreed to plea bargains. The case against FedEx grew out of a law enforcement campaign to shut down online pharmacies that supply pills to customers without verifying prescriptions. In recent years, the government broadened its scrutiny to companies that sell advertising to or deliver drugs for those pharmacies. The strategy resulted in the non-prosecution agreements with Google and United Parcel Service. In a statement this week, UPS said it “made a business decision” in 2013 to end the government investigation. Google declined to comment. Neither company faced criminal charges. After the 2014 FedEx indictment, Judge Breyer warned prosecutors in pretrial hearings that he viewed FedEx’s intent as crucial and the company’s claim that it cooperated with the DEA as an important consideration. The judge ordered prosecutors to hand over notes taken by the DEA during meetings with FedEx. They corroborated the company’s account that it had volunteered to help. Still, prosecutors moved forward, arguing in an opening statement that they would prove FedEx was “no more than part-time drug dealers.” Arguedas, the lawyer for FedEx, responded by citing many meetings with the DEA at which the company offered assistance, and noted FedEx had no way of identifying valid shipments. Ultimately, the judge said he was “critical of the decision to prosecute.” But, he added, abandoning the case was “entirely consistent with the government’s overarching obligation to seek justice even at the expense of some embarrassment.”   (Editing by Sue Horton and Lisa Girion)",7152016,http://www.reuters.com/article/fedex-doj/repeat-u-s-prosecutors-launch-review-of-failed-fedex-drug-case-idUSL1N1A1042

444,FDX,Rising revenue boosts FedEx quarterly profit,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Package delivery company FedEx Corp (FDX.N) said on Tuesday quarterly profit rose more than expected on stronger revenue in its express, ground and freight business units, lifting its stock by almost 3 percent. This was the first full quarter since FedEx completed its $4.8 billion acquisition of Dutch package delivery company TNT Express in May. “As we integrate these networks and take advantage of the unmatched road capabilities of TNT Express, I am confident there is going to be a tremendous opportunity to increase” FedEx earnings, Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf said in a statement. Excluding TNT integration costs, FedEx said it expected full-year fiscal 2017 earnings of $11.85 to $13.35 per share. Analysts’ consensus forecast is $11.93. Like main rival United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), FedEx is seen as a bellwether of U.S. economic activity. FedEx said it expects moderate economic growth, with U.S. gross domestic product up 1.6 percent in 2016 and rising 2.3 percent in 2017. U.S. industrial production should fall 0.7 percent this year and grow 2.2 percent in 2017, FedEx estimated. Memphis-based FedEx posted net income for its fiscal first quarter ended Aug. 31 of $715 million or $2.65 per share, compared with $692 million or $2.42 per share a year earlier. On an adjusted basis the company earned $2.90 per share. Analysts had on average expected earnings per share of $2.81. Revenue rose to $14.7 billion from $12.3 billion, above analysts’ expectations of $14.61 billion. Margins rose at the company’s FedEx Ground unit as average daily package volumes rose 10 percent over the previous year, driven by e-commerce. But margins fell at its Express and Freight units. Revenue at TNT was $1.8 billion, unchanged from the year-ago quarter. Restructuring and integration costs totaled $20 million, FedEx said. The company also incurred $28 million in intangible asset amortization expenses for TNT in the quarter. Edward Jones analyst Logan Purk said FedEx’s results reflected a solid performance in both its express and ground units.  “But investors want more details about TNT and rightfully so because this is a massive acquisition, it’s a bit of a game changer for them,” Purk said. “I would love more details too but I am going to give FedEx management the benefit of the doubt because this is a new acquisition and it’s a moving target for them.” In after-market trading, FedEx shares rose to $167.40 from a closing price of $162.65.

Circuit, NLRB attorney Kellie Isbell tried to convince the three-judge panel that the circuit’s 2009 rejection of the board’s decision about the employment status of Boston-area FedEx drivers does not prevent it from accepting the board’s ruling on the Connecticut drivers, which was based on a revised standard.

449,FDX,UPDATE 1-FedEx to invest $1.5 bln in France to double capacity at Roissy airport,"PARIS (Reuters) - Package delivery company FedEx Corp (FDX.N) said on Tuesday it would invest 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) to double the capacity of its logistics activities at Charles de Gaulle International Airport in the Paris suburb of Roissy. The initial investment by the U.S-listed firm will amount to 200 million euros ($220 million) for the extension of its facility in Roissy, the remaining 1.2 billion euros representing the guaranteed total amount of rent over 30 years. Under the plan, the U.S. group plans to open a new package sorting facility in 2019, creating between 200 and 400 jobs, according to a document handed out during a visit by President Francois Hollande.  “The opening of this facility is an additional sign of France’s attractiveness,” Hollande said.  “With the decision by Britons to leave the European Union, it should lead us to attract even more investments,” he added.  The extra 25,000 square meters of space will make FedEx’s Roissy center its second biggest in the world after the one in Memphis in the United States.  Delivery service company TNT Express, which was bought in May by FedEx, also plans to open a new facility in the Parisian region, according to the same document.

452,FDX,ZTO spurns huge China valuations for benefits of US listing,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese logistics company ZTO Express is turning up the chance of a much more lucrative share listing at home in favor of an overseas IPO that lets its founder retain control and its investors cash out more easily. To steal a march on its rivals in the world’s largest express delivery market, it is taking the quicker U.S. route to raise $1.3 billion for new warehouses and long-haul trucks to ride breakneck growth fueled by China’s e-commerce boom. Its competitors SF Express, YTO Express, STO Express and Yunda Express all unveiled plans several months ago for backdoor listings in Shenzhen and Shanghai, but ZTO’s head start could prove crucial, analysts and investors said. “ZTO will have a clear, certain route to raise additional capital via U.S. markets, which their competitors, assuming they all end up quoted in China, will not,” said Peter Fuhrman, CEO of China-focused investment bank China First Capital. With a backlog of about 800 companies waiting for approval to go public in China and frequent changes to the listing rules by regulators, a New York listing is generally a quicker and more predictable way of raising funds and taps a broader mix of investors, bankers and investors said. “ZTO will have a built-in long-term competitive advantage - more reliable access to equity capital,” Fuhrman added. U.S. rules that allow founder Meisong Lai to retain control over the company and make it easier for ZTO’s private equity investors to sell their shares were some of the main reasons to go for an overseas listing, according to four people close to the company. U.S. markets allow a dual-class share structure that will give Lai 80 percent voting power in the company, even though he will only hold 28 percent of the stock after the IPO.  Most of Lai’s shares are Class B ordinary shares carrying 10 votes, while Class A shares, including the new U.S. shares, have one vote. China’s markets do not allow shares with different voting power. ZTO’s existing shareholders, including private equity firms Warburg Pincus, Hillhouse Capital and venture capital firm Sequoia Capital will also get much more leeway and flexibility to exit their investment under U.S. market rules. In China, they would be locked in for one to three years after the IPO. As concerns grow about a weakening Chinese currency, the New York IPO also gives it more stable dollar-denominated shares it can use for international acquisitions, the people close to the company said. Demand for the IPO, the biggest by a Chinese company in the United States since e-commerce giant Alibaba Group’s $25 billion record in 2014, already exceeds the shares on offer multiple times, two of the people said. That underscores the appeal of the fast-growing company to global investors, despite a valuation that places it above household names United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp. The shares will be priced on Oct. 26 and start trading the following day. ZTO is selling 72.1 million new American Depositary Shares (ADS), equivalent to about 10 percent of its outstanding stock, in the range $16.50 to $18.50 each. The range is equal to 23.4-26.3 times its expected 2017 earnings per share, according to people familiar with the matter. By comparison, Chinese rivals SF Express, YTO Express, STO Express and Yunda shares trade between 43 and 106 times earnings, according to Haitong Securities estimates. UPS and FedEx, which are growing at a much slower pace, trade at multiples of 17.8 and 13.4 times. “The A-share market (in China) does give you a higher valuation, but the U.S. market can help improve your transparency and corporate governance,” said one of the people close to ZTO. “Becoming a New York-listed company will also benefit the company in the long-term if it plans to conduct M&A; overseas and seek more capital from the international market.” China’s express delivery firms handled 20.7 billion parcels in 2015, shifting 1.5 times the volume in the United States, according to consulting firm iResearch data cited in the ZTO prospectus. The market will grow an average 23.7 percent a year through 2020 and reach 60 billion parcels, iResearch forecasts. Domestic rivals STO Express and YTO Express have unveiled plans to go public with reverse takeovers worth $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion, while the country’s biggest player, SF Express, is working on a $6.4 billion deal and Yunda Express on a $2.7 billion listing. ZTO plans to use $720 million of the IPO proceeds to purchase land and invest in new facilities to expand its packaged sorting capacity, according to the listing prospectus. The rest will be used to expand its truck fleet, invest in new technology and for potential acquisitions. “It’s a competitive industry and you do need fresh capital for your expansion, in particular when all your rivals are doing so or plan to do so,” said one of the people close to the company.

457,FDX,Exclusive: FedEx grounds one plane over GE engine part concern,"(Reuters) - FedEx Corp is grounding one of its planes temporarily that has an engine General Electric Co flagged after a passenger jet erupted in flames last month, a spokesman for the cargo airline told Reuters on Monday. Engine-maker GE on Friday alerted airlines about a small number of parts under investigation following American Airlines Flight 383, which caught fire on Oct. 28. The parts were made from the same lot of alloy as a turbine disk used by American, which GE subsequently discovered had a “material anomaly.” While U.S. investigators have yet to assign blame for the non-fatal incident, they have found what appeared to be fatigue cracking where the disk had an anomaly. Experts have said the disk’s corrupted material may indicate a manufacturing defect, either by the parts or metal maker. In a statement, FedEx spokesman Chris Allen said the company was notified that an engine in one MD11 aircraft was affected.  “The aircraft associated with the affected engine is temporarily not in service until the engine is replaced.  Safety is our top priority,” he said. GE on Friday said all but one of the parts related to the anomalous disk were out of service. The component on the now-grounded FedEx plane had been the one in operation, GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said on Monday. “The part has been taken out of service, not because it was viewed as defective but because it was simply from the same lot of material,” Kennedy said in a statement. The American Airlines flight from Chicago to Miami aborted takeoff following an “uncontained” engine failure, a rare event in which components spew from an engine and can tear through an aircraft cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings. The airline was flying a Boeing Co 767 aircraft with CF6-80C2 engines made by GE. In this instance, the failure caused a fuel leak that resulted in a fire, though no one aboard was seriously injured. GE has stressed the reliability of its CF6 engines, which it said had flown more than 400 million hours since the 1970s.

463,FDX,FedEx CEO calls Trump's withdrawal from trade deal 'unfortunate',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump should reconsider his positions on international trade and work to embrace China and its vast market, FedEx Corp’s (FDX.N) chief executive officer said on Tuesday, one day after Trump made good on a campaign promise to pull out of a major trade deal with Asian allies. CEO Fred Smith, in separate media appearances on Tuesday, questioned Trump’s decision to formally withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The package and business services company employs thousands of people whose jobs depend on international trade.  “The United States being cut off from trade would be like trying to breathe without oxygen,” Smith said in an interview with Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo. Trump’s protectionist tone boosted his popularity with white, working class voters during the election, who helped him win some traditionally Democratic areas even as his words put him at odds with Republican orthodoxy on free trade.  Smith on Tuesday argued that some 40 million Americans have jobs as a result of trade, whose benefits are more “diffuse” and harder to see than the “pain” in areas like manufacturing.  “It’s an essential part of our economy. I think the decision to pull out of TPP is unfortunate because the real beneficiary of that is China. And China has been very mercantilist, very protectionist,” Smith said.  “We need to try to stop those things and get the Chinese to open up their 1.3 billion person market, not cut them off. We have the opportunity to sell huge amounts of goods into China.” Smith’s criticisms risk placing him in the president’s crosshairs as Trump has shown a willingness to rip into companies or individuals who displease him.  “I wouldn’t be surprised if Trump pushes back,” said Republican strategist David Carney. “Trump’s a new sheriff in town. The niceties of diplomacy and international trade... it’s just not the Trump way.” Trump also risks friction with members of his own party who support free trade, said Republican strategist Tom Doherty. On Monday, Trump signed an executive order to formally withdraw from the TPP as China’s influence in the region grows. The Republican president has been critical of China, which was not a party to the TPP.  Trump also said he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement at an “appropriate time,” following another campaign pledge to redo the NAFTA trade pact with Canada and Mexico. Smith, who met with Trump in New York following his November election victory, urged the new president to reconsider his position toward the Asian powerhouse despite China’s historic protectionism during an earlier interview on CBS’ “This Morning.”  “To some degree, the administration’s positions are a little bit out of date with reality of China today. They want to open their markets today,” Smith told CBS. Since well before November’s election, Smith, 72, criticized the positions of both Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, saying he hoped cooler heads would prevail after the election. In June 2016, he told analysts on an earnings conference call, that anti-trade rhetoric and anti-business positions expressed on the campaign trail were “very worrisome.” FedEx, with revenues topping $50 billion last year, employs more than 400,000 people globally, according to its website.

466,FDX,"UPDATE 5-Facing rising e-commerce, UPS looks to automation, higher prices","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Facing lower margins from its rising e-commerce business, package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) said on Tuesday that it would pull forward investments in automation and technology and could raise prices to offset the reduced profits from delivering packages to consumers. Atlanta-based UPS posted a quarterly loss Tuesday caused by a pension charge and gave a full-year profit forecast below analysts’ expectations, helping push its shares down nearly 7 percent. Like rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N), UPS has been struggling to figure out how to lower e-commerce-related costs. UPS and FedEx have raised package rates by between 4.9 percent and 5.9 percent annually since 2009.     “At the same time as we’re going to focus on the cost curve ... we’re also going to continue to focus on yield management,” Chief Executive David Abney told Reuters. “If (e-commerce) is going to continue to drive additional costs, then we have to make sure we pass on that cost to our customers.”  Delivering packages to residential addresses costs more than to businesses because businesses received more packages per stop than individual consumers.  UPS said fourth-quarter shipments to residential addresses from business rose 11.5 percent and a record-high 63 percent of deliveries in December were to homes. But while revenue at UPS’ flagship U.S. domestic package business rose 6.3 percent, revenue per package fell 6.1 percent. Abney said the company would increase its capital expenditures to around $4 billion in 2017 from $3 billion last year, further boosting automation and technology to handle e-commerce packages. He said UPS would examine how to pass on rising costs to customers. Stephens Inc analyst Jack Atkins said that investors are beginning to chafe at rising capital investments at UPS and FedEx that have not led to margin growth in recent years. “What’s got people troubled is they’re making all these investments just to keep margins where they are,” Atkins said. “Investors are beginning to ask when will we see returns on these investments?” In a client note, Credit Suisse analyst Allison Landry said the additional spending “calls into question whether e-commerce is more capital intensive than previously understood, and it leaves less cash available for share buybacks.”  The package delivery company reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $239 million, or 27 cents per share, compared with a net profit of $1.33 billion, or $1.48 per share, a year earlier.  Excluding the non-cash, after-tax pension charge of $1.90 per share, UPS reported earnings per share of $1.63. Analysts expected $1.69. The charge is related to the company’s defined benefit pension programs for employees. When UPS finds that its long-term obligations for the pensions are not fully funded, it sets aside extra cash to cover the shortfall. UPS said it expected full-year 2017 EPS in a range of $5.80 to $6.10, adding that the strong U.S. dollar should lower adjusted EPS by 30 cents.   Analysts have predicted earnings per share of $6.17 in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue in the quarter rose to $16.93 billion from $16.05 billion a year earlier.

467,FDX,"Amazon to spend $1.49 billion on air cargo hub, fans talk of bigger ambitions","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc plans to invest $1.49 billion to build a large air cargo hub in northern Kentucky, state officials said on Tuesday, stoking expectations it may one day opt to directly compete with FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc. The world’s biggest online retailer has agreed to a 50-year lease for about 900 acres of property from Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport - close in size to the global hubs of top cargo airlines. Amazon is handling more shipping in-house so it can deliver packages to customers faster, as well as cut costs and uncertainty associated with relying on third parties. It has said its moves are designed to supplement, not replace cargo carriers. Analysts suspect it has larger ambitions. “We estimate a $400 billion-plus market opportunity for Amazon in delivery, freight forwarding, and contract logistics,” Colin Sebastian, an analyst for Baird Equity Research, said in a note to clients.     Amazon, which has not announced a start date for the hub,  said it expects to create more than 2,000 jobs when the site opens. The northern Kentucky location - not far from UPS’s major hub - puts Amazon’s aircraft in shooting distance of top cities. The company said last year it would lease 40 Boeing Co 767 planes, 16 of which are currently in service. It also lets Amazon’s trucks reach 11 fulfillment centers in state. And a large operation of Deutsche Post DHL there lets Amazon transfer packages easily abroad, said Brian Clancy, managing director of advisory firm Logistics Capital & Strategy LLC. As part of the investment, Amazon anticipates it will spend nearly $462 million on building and improvements over an unspecified number of years, according to a report by the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority. The authority’s board tentatively approved $40 million in tax incentives for Amazon over ten years if it meets hiring commitments, with average wages including benefits targeted at $26 per hour, the report said.      So far, Amazon has loaded its aircraft with big but lightweight boxes, according to data reviewed by Reuters and interviews with airport officials around the United States. This has helped it dodge fees from cargo partners, which are increasingly pricing by volume rather than weight. Amazon’s new site compares with about 1,220 acres UPS has in Louisville. FedEx has more than 900 in its Memphis hub, a 2010 airport plan showed.

Amazon, which has not announced a start date for the hub,  said it expects to create more than 2,000 jobs when the site opens. The northern Kentucky location - not far from UPS’s major hub - puts Amazon’s aircraft in shooting distance of top cities. The company said last year it would lease 40 Boeing Co 767 planes, 16 of which are currently in service. It also lets Amazon’s trucks reach 11 fulfillment centers in state. And a large operation of Deutsche Post DHL there lets Amazon transfer packages easily abroad, said Brian Clancy, managing director of advisory firm Logistics Capital & Strategy LLC. As part of the investment, Amazon anticipates it will spend nearly $462 million on building and improvements over an unspecified number of years, according to a report by the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority. The authority’s board tentatively approved $40 million in tax incentives for Amazon over ten years if it meets hiring commitments, with average wages including benefits targeted at $26 per hour, the report said.      So far, Amazon has loaded its aircraft with big but lightweight boxes, according to data reviewed by Reuters and interviews with airport officials around the United States. This has helped it dodge fees from cargo partners, which are increasingly pricing by volume rather than weight. Amazon’s new site compares with about 1,220 acres UPS has in Louisville. FedEx has more than 900 in its Memphis hub, a 2010 airport plan showed.

471,FDX,Market delivers crazy love letter to China's FedEx,"HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Stock-market investors have sent a love letter to China’s FedEx. A rally in the newly listed firm behind SF Express makes boss Wang Wei one of China’s richest men. At roughly $40 billion, his company is now worth nearly as much as Deutsche Post. That looks like an overreaction, driven by hype over e-commerce and a shortage of tradable shares. Few foreigners will have heard of Wang or his delivery group. But shares in SF Holding have shot up more than 70 percent since it finalised a reverse listing in Shenzhen last week, making it the most valuable company on China’s second bourse.  On Wednesday, the 46-year-old briefly overtook Alibaba boss Jack Ma as China’s second-richest man with a $29 billion fortune, according to Forbes.  SF Express, which focuses on business-to-business deliveries, has emerged as a leader in China’s fast-growing logistics sector. But the figures are still hard to justify. At Wednesday’s closing price of 70 yuan ($10.19) the stock is worth 53 times this year’s earnings, according to Sinolink forecasts. Even allowing for considerably greater growth potential, that is a huge premium over U.S. peers FedEx and United Parcel Service, which both trade at less than 20 times forward earnings. China’s wonky markets deserve some blame. A lack of flotations in Shanghai and Shenzhen means reverse listings will typically lure lots of retail investors. Many punters focus on concepts more than valuation – and the delivery sector looks like an attractive bet on China’s new economy. SF Holding’s small free float makes matters worse. Last year, it agreed a reverse merger with a little-known metals company to gain a backdoor listing. The deal means most SF shares are under a three-year lockup and other restrictions: Eikon categorises just 3 percent of its total shares as “negotiable”, suggesting the rest cannot be easily bought and sold. The craze may be starting to fade, however. Caixin says regulators are looking at the rapid ascent. And as of early afternoon on Thursday, SF shares had dipped, making Wang merely China’s third-richest man. The country’s fickle investors can blow hot and cold.",3022017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sf-holdings-stocks-breakingviews/market-delivers-crazy-love-letter-to-chinas-fedex-idUSKBN1690UF
472,FDX,UPDATE 2-UPS wins court challenge against EU block to TNT bid,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - An EU court agreed with United Parcel Service (UPS.N) on  Tuesday that the EU had wrongly blocked its takeover of Dutch peer TNT four years ago, potentially allowing the world’s largest package delivery company to sue regulators for damages. The European Commission rejected the 5.2 billion euro ($5.5 billion) deal in 2013, saying UPS had not offered sufficient concessions to allay concerns that the deal would hurt consumers. The deal would have expanded its presence in Asia and Latin America. While TNT has since been bought by FedEx (FDX.N) in a 4.4 billion euro deal approved by the Commission last year, the ruling by Europe’s second-highest court could affect other contentious deals. UPS subsequently challenged the EU decision at the Luxembourg-based General Court. Judges annulled the EU decision on Tuesday, citing a procedural irregularity. The court said the Commission had infringed UPS’s rights of defense by using a different econometric model in its analysis than that used in previous exchange of views and arguments. “UPS might have been better able to defend itself if it had at its disposal, before the adoption of the contested decision, the final version of the econometric model chosen by the Commission,” it said. While the ruling is not expected to have any impact on the package delivery market, it shows that regulators have to present and communicate their case clearly to merging companies, said James Killick, a partner at law firm White & Case. “I don’t think you can undo the two mergers. You can’t rewrite history. The ruling shows, however, the importance of due process especially in the merger process where time is short,” he said. UPS could potentially now sue for damages, he added. UPS said it was pleased with the court’s reasoning. “While the decision in UPS’s favor makes a number of points, the most significant of this decision is its impact in helping to preserve a competitive environment in Europe by clarifying the procedure and relevant criteria for merger approval,” it said. The Commission said it was studying the judgment.

473,FDX,6th Circuit delivers win to former FedEx worker in age bias case,"A federal appeals court on Wednesday revived age discrimination claims against Federal Express Corp by a former manager, saying a lower court erred in finding that derogatory comments a supervisor made about older workers were irrelevant. A unanimous three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Gerard Howley, who worked at a FedEx office in Novi, Michigan for more than two decades before he was fired in 2013, had sufficiently alleged that his supervisor used minor infractions as an excuse to terminate him.

474,FDX,"FedEx misses on earnings, but sees higher margins ahead","NEW YORK (Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N) on Tuesday reported worse-than-expected quarterly operating earnings, but an optimistic outlook for margins in the near-term soothed investor concerns and pushed the stock higher in after-hours trading. Shares of FedEx, often considered a bellwether for the U.S. economy like rival UPS (UPS.N) because they offer a window into how the economy is faring, dropped around 4 percent after the company released earnings, but bounced back to trade up 2.4 percent to $196.39. “Looking at the quarter in isolation, it’s not great, but looking forward, which is what the market is going to focus on, it actually looks fairly bright,” said Logan Purk, an analyst with Edward Jones. Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith said in a conference call with analysts that the company expects a margin of “15 percent plus in the current quarter” for the ground segment, and was broadly optimistic beyond that.  “Margins, cash flows and returns are going to increase over the next several years,” he said. The company has been grappling with lower margins on its ecommerce business, as deliveries to individual homes are typically more expensive than deliveries to businesses that often get several packages at once. FedEx has also faced increased competition from Amazon (AMZN.O), which has expanded into the delivery business.  But the company on Tuesday dismissed Amazon’s move into that area. “Let me just say that Amazon is a longstanding customer of ours,” said Raj Subramaniam, executive vice president of global marketing and communications. “They still rely heavily on USPS, UPS and FedEx for delivery.” Smith said Amazon was unlikely to pose a major threat to FedEx. “Amazon is a wonderful company, and they certainly have revolutionized the ecommerce world, and we’re not sure what Amazon’s going to do one way or another,” he said. “But the FedEx system that consists of thousands of facilities ... has been decades in the making,” Smith said. Revenue rose 19 percent, however, reflecting a rise in fuel and other costs, margins were lower in the ground and freight segments and net income rose only 11 percent.  The Memphis-based company reported net income for its fiscal third quarter ending Feb. 28 of $562 million or $2.07 per share, up from $507 million or $1.84 per share, a year earlier. Adjusted for one-time items, the company reported earnings per share of $2.35. Analysts had expected $2.62 per share.

478,FDX,U.S. prosecutors to monitor corporate cases after failed FedEx trial,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department in San Francisco has instituted new oversight for complex cases, a federal prosecutor said, following a failed drug conspiracy prosecution against delivery service FedEx Corp (FDX.N). U.S. Attorney Brian Stretch, in an interview with Reuters last week, said his staff has identified about 20 of the office’s most complex cases to undergo “investigative progress reviews.” He declined to identify any specific matters but said such cases would likely include corporate fraud and complicated drug investigations. Every two months, the lead prosecutor assigned to such a case will meet with supervisors in the office, including the U.S. attorney, Stretch said. Management will receive regular updates on the investigation, help decide novel legal issues, and ensure the case receives proper resources. “This allows everybody in chain to be sharing in real time a lot of the decisions on these larger investigations,” Stretch said. The new protocols were put in place after Stretch ordered a review of the FedEx case to improve future prosecutions. In that case, prosecutors obtained a grand jury indictment in 2014 against the courier service alleging it had knowingly helped internet pharmacies ship illegal pills. The Justice Department abruptly dropped all charges four days into trial last year amid evidence the company had actually tried to cooperate with the government on combating such pharmacies. The judge commended the decision, saying it was clear FedEx was “factually innocent.” An attorney for FedEx called the prosecution “an epic institutional failure.” Stretch’s office is currently investigating a phony accounts scandal at Wells Fargo & Co. John Zach, a former federal prosecutor in Manhattan who investigated SAC Capital, said unit chiefs in that U.S. attorneys office closely monitored cases but line prosecutors did not usually meet with top officials until it was time to decide if someone would face charges.    The problem in the FedEx case was that prosecutors, including supervisors, did not recognize the significance of cooperation evidence that FedEx had highlighted before the company was charged, FedEx attorney Cristina Arguedas said.  The new oversight system “is certainly a good idea,” Arguedas said, although its success will depend on whether supervisors look at the actual evidence or rely on a single prosecutor’s interpretation. Stretch declined to comment on FedEx case details, but said no one wants to have to dismiss a case during trial.  “It is my expectation that this new review process can only aid with such situations,” he said.

Shares of the company, often considered a bellwether for the U.S. economy like rival United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), were marginally up at $210.6 in after-market trading on Tuesday. FedEx forecast adjusted earnings of $13.20 to $14 per share for fiscal 2018, excluding mark-to-market pension adjustments and expenses on TNT Express integration.  The company reported adjusted earnings of $12.30 per share for fiscal 2017. Sales in its biggest business, FedEx Express, rose 6.9 percent to $7.18 billion. The business provides U.S. domestic and international shipping services for delivery of packages and freight. Sales in its ground business unit rose 9.1 percent and freight business 5.7 percent. FedEx and UPS have been spending billions of dollars to upgrade their networks to handle rapidly rising e-commerce package volumes, leaving investors chafing over the expense. UPS said on Monday it will levy surcharges on U.S. residential packages during its crucial peak holiday season this year as it seeks to combat the spiraling costs of delivering e-commerce packages. However, FedEx has not made a final decision on additional charges during the holiday season, the company said on post-earnings conference call.  The Memphis-based company has also faced increased competition from Amazon (AMZN.O), which has expanded into the delivery business and announced last week that it was buying Whole Foods Market Inc WFM.O for $13.7 billion.

506,FDX,FedEx will not charge extra for most holiday home deliveries,"(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N) said on Thursday it will not charge customers extra fees for most packages delivered to homes during the peak holiday shopping season this year, challenging rival United Parcel Service, which plans more widespread peak-season surcharges. FedEx’s holiday pricing strategy steps up the Memphis-based company’s battle with UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, for a greater share of e-commerce business driven by retailers like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N). UPS and FedEx have spent billions of dollars on upgrading their networks to handle rapidly rising e-commerce package volumes, particularly in the weeks leading up to Christmas.  Atlanta-based UPS has charted a different course for pricing this holiday season. Parcels delivered to residences, as well as large packages and those exceeding system weight limits, would face surcharges of up to 97 cents for two-day air services to residential addresses from Dec. 17-23, UPS said. A 27-cent surcharge per package will apply to UPS’ ground service from Nov. 19 to Dec. 2 and between Dec. 17 and Dec. 23, UPS said. UPS declined to comment on FedEx’s surcharges, but said its own peak-season pricing makes sure its “appropriately compensated for the high value we provide at a time when the company must double daily delivery volume for six-to-seven consecutive weeks to meet customer demands.” Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said usually large shippers such as Amazon negotiate their own rates, so the impact from this would likely be limited.  A spokeswoman for Amazon did not immediately return a request for comment. FedEx and UPS shares dipped slightly in trading on Thursday. FedEx Express and FedEx Ground in the U.S. and Canada will increase holiday surcharges for additional handling by $3 per package and for oversized goods by $25. FedEx will charge an extra $300 for parcels that exceed its maximum weight limit. FedEx said the new surcharges on oversize packages hit roughly 10 percent of its ground-shipping volume during the holiday rush and will be in place the week leading up to Black Friday through Christmas Eve. Amit Mehrotra, an analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York, said UPS and FedEx “aren’t that far off from each other.” “FedEx will not be matching UPS as far as a blanket surcharge, but it is taking equal steps to manage its higher costs associated with oversized or extraordinary packages, things that are huge to push through their facilities.” ",8032017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fedex-surcharge/fedex-will-not-charge-extra-for-most-holiday-home-deliveries-idUSKBN1AJ1V5

UPS (UPS.N), the world’s largest package delivery company, has restored service to more than 150 zip codes in Texas over the last 24 hours though operations remained at a standstill in storm-battered Houston and other Gulf Coast areas, UPS spokesman Matt O’Connor said. Trucks for both companies returned to deliveries on routes in Corpus Christi.  “The safety of our employees comes first and we will be resuming service as soon as it is safe to do so,” O’Connor said. “In Houston, that will come down to local areas that were impacted and how quickly water subsides.” The first UPS plane into Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport will land on Thursday afternoon and three flights were expected to depart Friday morning, O’Connor said. The airport was closed to commercial flight operations from Sunday and said limited flight operations were resuming Thursday afternoon. Memphis-based FedEx was also running some ramp operations at Bush and resumed limited delivery service in parts of Corpus Christi and Victoria, Texas, a spokeswoman said.

524,FDX,"Cyber attack, hurricane weigh on FedEx quarterly profit","(Reuters) - Package delivery company FedEx Corp (FDX.N) said on Tuesday a June cyber attack on its Dutch unit slashed $300 million from its quarterly profit, and the company lowered its full-year earnings forecast. The company said the cyber attack slashed 79 cents per share from its profit - nearly 40 times the 2 cents per share caused by deadly Hurricane Harvey, which brought catastrophic flooding to southeastern Texas. FedEx joins a string of companies that reported big drops in earnings due to the NotPetya virus, which hit on June 29, crippling Ukraine businesses before spreading worldwide to shut down shipping ports, factories and corporate offices. “The impact of the cyberattack on TNT Express and lower-than-expected results at FedEx Ground reduced our first-quarter earnings,” said FedEx Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf. “We are currently executing plans to mitigate the full-year impact of these issues.” Shares of the Memphis-based company, often considered a bellwether for the U.S. economy as are those of rival United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), dipped more than 2 percent in after-hours trading. FedEx reported net income for its fiscal first quarter ended Aug. 31 of $596 million or $2.19 per share, down more than 16 percent from the year-ago $715 million or $2.65 per share.   Excluding one-time items, the company reported earnings per share of $2.51. Wall Street analysts had expected earnings per share of $3.09. Excluding the impact of the cyber attack and Hurricane Harvey, FedEx said it would have posted EPS of $3.32, above analysts’ expectations. Most services of the Dutch TNT Express unit resumed during the quarter and systems had been restored, but TNT Express volume, revenue and profit still remained below pre-attack levels, the company said. FedEx did not have insurance in place that covered the impact from the cyber attack. FedEx also said higher shipping rates across its operating units were more than offset by the cyber attack, costs related to the integration of its TNT unit, higher costs at its FedEx ground, and a higher tax rate. The company’s operating margin fell to 7.3 percent from 8.6 percent. FedEx lowered its forecast for fiscal 2018 earnings per diluted share to a range of $11.05 to $11.85, from a previous range of $12.45 to $13.25. Analysts forecast earnings of $13.01 per share for the full year. Overall revenue rose to $15.3 billion from $14.7 billion in the year-ago period. Analysts had expected 15.35 billion. FedEx said on Monday it will increase its Express, Ground, and Home Delivery shipping rates by an average of 4.9 percent on Jan. 1. FedEx and UPS usually unveil price increases for the coming year around this time.

528,FDX,FedEx says financial drain from cyber attack to linger through 2018,"Sept 20 (Reuters) - Package delivery company FedEx Corp said on Wednesday a June cyber attack on its Dutch unit will continue to hurt revenue through its second fiscal quarter and fiscal full-year 2018 and force bigger investments in information technology. FedEx joins a string of companies that reported big drops in earnings because of the NotPetya virus, which hit on June 29, crippling Ukraine businesses before spreading worldwide to shut down shipping ports, factories and corporate offices. FedEx Corp on Tuesday reported a lower-than-expected quarterly net profit due to the cyber attack, the impact of Hurricane Harvey and higher costs, and also lowered its full-year earnings forecast. While the Memphis-based company has made progress restoring operations at TNT Express, which it acquired last year for $4.8 billion, its revenues, volumes and profits remain below pre-attack levels, FedEx said. It said it expects ongoing, but diminishing, financial impacts through the remainder of 2018. FedEx also said in filings its second-quarter 2018 results will be hurt by the integration of TNT Express and disruptions to its service from hurricanes that unleashed damage across the southern United States in recent weeks.

535,FDX,Turboprop maker ATR clinches U.S. comeback with FedEx order,"PARIS (Reuters) - ATR, the world’s largest maker of regional turboprop planes, on Wednesday announced an order from FedEx Express for at least 30 newly designed 72-600F freighter models, sealing its return to the lucrative U.S. market for the first time in over two decades. The aircraft will be the first to be delivered by the Franco-Italian planemaker in a brand-new freighter configuration rather than as passenger planes, a move that may also boost the recently lacklustre second-hand market for its turboprop fleet. ATR, a joint venture between Airbus (AIR.PA) and Italian company Leonardo (LDOF.MI), said the FedEx order comprised firm plans to buy 30 of the planes, with an option to buy another 20. Deliveries will begin in 2020, it added. ATR earlier this year reported a preliminary deal to supply 20 aircraft to Fort Lauderdale-based Silver Airways, but the FedEx deal marks its first firm contract in the world’s largest aviation market and involves a marquee customer. “It is an important deal for ATR which has been cooking for some time,” a person familiar with the negotiations said. “Having a freighter program also opens a greater perspective for the second-hand market,” he added. Passenger jets often get recycled as freighters after years in service. The U.S. breakthrough follows tentative deals announced at the Paris Airshow earlier this year to sell ATR turboprops to China, which is on course to overtake the U.S. as the world’s  aviation powerhouse and is developing its own rival turboprop. Brazil’s Embraer (EMBR3.SA) has also expressed interest in returning to the market for turboprops, which tend to be more efficient than some jets over short distances. ATR’s only significant current competitor is Canada’s Bombardier, whose Q400 it outsells by around three to one. Bombardier has said it is confident of increasing its 25 percent market share. The U.S. deal is a victory for ATR chief executive Christian Scherer, who was appointed a year ago with plans to expand the European company’s footprint. Industry sources say the Airbus veteran was involved in a previous assault on the U.S. market via FedEx in the 1980s, when the then struggling European company struck a tentative deal to sell 24 unwanted jets to the U.S. package firm. That deal was never completed and Airbus later secured a foothold in the U.S. by offloading half of the jets to PanAm.

541,FDX,"Strong package volume, global economy boost FedEx profit","(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N) on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected quarterly net profit due to strong global demand and increased package volumes during the peak holiday shipping season, but its results were hit by lingering effects from a cyber attack on its Dutch unit. The Memphis-based company, which is often considered a bellwether for the U.S. economy, said the June cyber attack on TNT Express TNTEF.PK cut $100 million from fiscal second-quarter profit. FedEx raised its projected costs of integrating TNT Express through fiscal 2020 to about $1.4 billion from a previous estimate of $800 million. It acquired the Dutch company last year for $4.8 billion.  Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith said FedEx was “on track for another record holiday-shipping season,” referring to late November through the New Year. Edward Jones analyst Logan Purk said FedEx “clearly exceeded expectations on the earnings front,” but “there might be some push-back in regards to the increased integration costs with TNT and the overall flat profitability in its ground (small-package delivery services) segment.” FedEx and rival United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) have spent billions to upgrade their networks to handle rapidly rising e-commerce package volumes, particularly in the weeks leading up to Christmas.  FedEx has been grappling with lower margins on its e-commerce business, as deliveries to individual homes are typically more expensive than deliveries to businesses that often receive several packages at once. FedEx has also faced increased competition from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), which has expanded into the delivery business.  FedEx’s quarterly net income rose to $775 million, or $2.84 per share, from $700 million, or $2.59 per share, a year earlier. Adjusted for one-time items, FedEx reported earnings per share of $3.18, beating analysts’ expectations of $2.89. Results also reflect a roughly $80 million tax benefit from foreign tax credits associated with a dividend from overseas operations, and a favorable net impact from fuel, the company said. FedEx said it expects full-year fiscal 2018 earnings per share in a range of $12.70 to $13.30, excluding items. Analysts had forecast earnings of $12.45 per share for the full fiscal year.  Its full-year estimate would be improved by changes the company has said it hopes to see under a sweeping tax overhaul that appeared headed for congressional approval soon.

543,FDX,"UPDATE 4-Trump wants Postal Service to charge ""much more"" for Amazon shipments","SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge “much more” to ship packages for Amazon (AMZN.O), picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.     “Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year, Trump has said the “Amazon Washington Post” fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax, which is not true, and so hurts other retailers, part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives, a research analyst at GBH Insights, said Trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However, he said he was not concerned for Amazon. “We do not see any price hikes in the future. However, that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively,” he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service, including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015, the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1,175.90 by early afternoon. Overall, U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix Inc, which analyzes shipping data, disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services, he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages, for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season, Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys, from post offices to customers’ doorsteps. Amazon’s No. 2 carrier is UPS, at 21 percent, and FedEx is third, with 8 percent or so, according to Jindel. Trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce, which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service, but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon, the White House, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump’s tweet. According to its annual report, the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year, and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service’s revenue for first class mail, marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining, revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February, the service is facing growing personnel expenses, particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law, the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue.

544,FDX,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 3-Trump wants Postal Service to charge ""much more"" for Amazon shipments","(Fixes name to Government Accountability Office in paragraph 20) By Makini Brice and Eric M. Johnson WASHINGTON/SEATTLE, Dec 29 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge “much more” to ship packages for Amazon, picking another fight with the online retail giant he has criticized in the past. “Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!” Trump wrote on Twitter. The president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have been shipped all over the country for the holiday season. The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website. The U.S. president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November. Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper that Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year, Trump has said the “Amazon Washington Post” fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax, which is not true, and so hurts other retailers, part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives, a research analyst at GBH Insights, said Trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However, he said he was not concerned for Amazon. “We do not see any price hikes in the future. However, that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively,” he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service. In 2015, the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.

Amazon is running “Shipping with Amazon” in Los Angeles and possibly other locations, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on condition of anonymity. News of the test sparked investor concern that the world’s largest online retailer would upend the shipping market. FedEx Corp (FDX.N) and United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) shares were down more than 4 percent in afternoon trading. FedEx, UPS and analysts played down the idea that a trial poses a near-term threat to the couriers’ businesses.  Cowen and Co analyst Helane Becker estimated Amazon would have to invest $100 billion to build a global network of facilities, planes and trucks to compete with FedEx and UPS. See a graphic unpacking Amazon and the 'Prime economy' here: http://reut.rs/2EfyCqy The program, while still at an early stage, aims to reduce hurdles that some sellers face getting their inventory to Amazon’s facilities. Under the new process being tested, Amazon sends a truck to pick up sellers’ products, which then takes inventory either directly to an Amazon fulfillment center or to the U.S. Postal Service or to couriers like FedEx, depending on what’s most cost-effective, said the person who spoke to Reuters. Amazon has run a number of experiments in Los Angeles because the city is spread out and is a big market for deliveries. “Shipping with Amazon” is currently intended for select third-party sellers in the test, not for businesses in general, and still it is not yet ready to roll out widely to sellers on Amazon, said the person. FedEx and UPS customers should not expect to shift their business to Amazon any time soon. The Seattle-based company has considered taking work from the couriers on a conceptual level but does not have initiatives currently planned to ramp up competition, the person said. Amazon said on Friday it was “always innovating and experimenting on behalf of customers and the businesses that sell and grow on Amazon to create faster lower-cost delivery choices.” UPS and FedEx have both spent billions of dollars in recent years to upgrade and expand their networks to handle soaring e-commerce volumes. UPS said last week it plans to spend $7 billion on upgrading its network this year alone. UPS and FedEx also consider Amazon an important customer. Amazon accounts for less than 10 percent of total revenue for UPS and 4 percent of revenue for FedEx, according to Wolfe Research analyst Scott Group. UPS and FedEx declined to comment on Amazon’s specific strategies or decisions regarding the utilization of their services. “There is tremendous opportunity in the business-to-customer market and more growth coming to the sector and UPS, irrespective of how other companies shift strategies,” UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara said.

The data was stored on a Amazon S3 storage server and collected by a company FedEx acquired in 2014, Bongo International, which calculated international shipping prices and provided other services. FedEx later discontinued the service. “After a preliminary investigation, we can confirm that some archived Bongo International account information located on a server hosted by a third-party, public cloud provider is secure,” FedEx spokesman Jim McCluskey said in a statement.  “We have found no indication that any information has been misappropriated and will continue our investigation,” McCluskey said. McCluskey declined to elaborate on what portion of the records were secure, or whether FedEx had notified authorities. The incident affected a tiny portion of FedEx customers globally. The exposure appears far less disruptive than a cyber attack last year on Fedex’s Dutch TNT Express unit, which slashed $300 million from its quarterly profit.

Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) plans to compete directly with package delivery companies UPS (UPS.N) and Fedex (FDX.N) as it expands its transport and logistics business, its chief executive said on Tuesday. Maersk, the world’s largest container shipping company, sold its North Sea-focused oil and gas business in August to France’s Total (TOTF.PA) in a $7.5 billion deal in August as it focuses on transport and logistics.  As part of its restructuring, Maersk aims to expand its services to all parts of the supply chain, giving customers the chance to deal with one firm when shipping goods from one side  of the world to another. “We’re building this company that is a global integrated container business, a company very similar to UPS and Fedex,” CEO Soren Skou told investors at a capital markets day in Copenhagen on Tuesday. “I hope they will be considered peers of ours, when we are done with this journey in 3-5 years,” he added. The capital markets day was being held less than two weeks after the world’s largest container shipping firm missed profit forecasts and gave what analysts saw as a conservative outlook. Maersk has acknowledged that despite handling one in seven containers globally, being the biggest is no longer enough, as the growth of e-commerce is driving demand for quicker, easier and more flexible shipping. “Our customers businesses are to a large extent changing, they are being disrupted by new technologies, by e-commerce and new ways of doing things,” said Maersk’s chief commercial officer Vincent Clerc. Maersk is betting that a digital drive, in which it for example has teamed up with IBM (IBM.N) to create an industry-wide blockchain-based trading platform, will allow it to offer more value-added services in areas such as freight forwarding and trade finance. However, on Tuesday investors were left with little detail on Maersk plans to monetize the blockchain project or how it will use the proceeds from breaking up the conglomerate. Shares in Maersk were trading 4.6 percent lower at 10,400 Danish crowns at 1420 GMT, below the August level when the Total sale was announced and around same level as when it announced its new strategy in September 2016.  “Many had hoped for something more specific for example with regards to how the proceeds from the sale of Maersk Oil will be distributed,” said Sydbank analyst Morten Imsgard of the fall in share price. The firm still aims to find solutions this year for its offshore drilling and supply service unit, which is being valued at $4.7 billion and $0.6 billion respectively according to analysts’ consensus.

FedEx said its positions on the issues of gun policy and safety differ from those of the NRA. The shipper supports restricting assault rifles to the military and opposes allowing civilians to use them. (bit.ly/2EUzRvH) “While we strongly support the constitutional right of U.S. citizens to own firearms subject to appropriate background checks, FedEx views assault rifles and large capacity magazines as an inherent potential danger to schools, workplaces, and communities when such weapons are misused,” FedEx said. As for discounts, it added that “FedEx has never set or changed rates for any of our millions of customers around the world in response to their politics, beliefs or positions on issues.” ",2262018,http://www.reuters.com/article/fedex-nra/fedex-wont-drop-nra-from-discount-program-idUSL4N1QG62H

Through DHL eCommerce’s Parcel Metro service, first reported by Reuters, contractors will make same-day or next-day deliveries from retailers and fulfillment centers directly to homes, the company said.  “This sector (e-commerce) offers a tremendous amount of opportunity to the logistics space,” DHL eCommerce Americas Chief Executive Officer Lee Spratt said when announcing the service at an event in San Francisco.

FedEx and UPS have told Amazon they won’t scale with them, meaning that Amazon has to figure out a way to support their delivery network themselves,” Becker said. “It also helps that DHL’s U.S. hub is in Cincinnati and that is where Amazon is building their air hub. We don’t think that’s a coincidence,” she added.  DHL eCommerce Chief Executive Charles Brewer told Reuters Amazon is a large customer but Parcel Metro was not designed with Amazon in mind.  Amazon and FedEx did not immediately respond to requests for comment. UPS said it does not comment on competitor business strategies. DHL has been testing Parcel Metro in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York for the last two years, the company said. It will roll out in Dallas, Atlanta, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. by end-2018 and look to add other global cities in the years ahead, it said. Parcel Metro relies on third-party contract couriers and app-based driver pools to pick up products like books, shoes, shampoo, and electronics from retailers or warehouses and deliver the items directly to households, Spratt said.

569,FDX,"Strong economy, higher rates lift FedEx quarterly profit","(Reuters) - Package delivery company FedEx Corp (FDX.N) on Tuesday reported a higher quarterly net profit on revenue gains, strong volumes and changes to U.S. tax law even as it was hurt by peak holiday season costs and bad weather.  Shares in the Memphis-based company, considered an indicator of U.S. economic strength like its main rival United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), initially rose 2.6 percent in after-market trade following the results but settled down about 1 percent. “We view this quarter as a bit of a disappointment due to weakness in the Express business,” Edward Jones analyst Logan Purk said in a client note, adding strong package volume and higher package revenue were offset by higher expenses in its Express unit. Higher peak-related costs, integration costs of its Dutch TNT Express unit, bad weather, and other factors sapped profit by about $170 million year-over-year, FedEx said. FedEx’s results came the day a package bomb blew up at a FedEx distribution center near San Antonio, the fifth in a series of attacks that have rocked Texas this month. FedEx Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith told analysts on a call following the results he was thankful there were no serious injuries and said FedEx has provided law enforcement “extensive evidence from our advanced technology security systems.”  FedEx reported its daily package volume were up 6 percent in the quarter, driven by demand during the peak holiday shipping season that begins after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday and lasts through year-end. FedEx investments to expand capacity and choose higher-profit shipments, coupled with higher prices and volumes, paid off slightly as its Ground unit saw quarterly operating margins rise to 12.1 percent from 11 percent in the year-ago period. Like its main rival, FedEx has spent billions of dollars on upgrading its network to handle rapidly rising deliveries of products ordered online, and investors were watching eagerly for evidence the investments were paying off.  FedEx lowered it 2018 capex spending forecast by $100 million to $5.8 billion.

Adjusted for one-time items, the company reported earnings per share of $3.72. Wall Street analysts had expected earnings per share of $3.11.

579,FDX,Sixth Texas parcel bomb leaves U.S. investigators baffled,"AUSTIN/SCHERTZ, Texas (Reuters) - A parcel packed with nails and shrapnel blew up on Tuesday at a FedEx Corp center near San Antonio, Texas, injuring a worker, before a second booby-trapped package was intercepted in Austin - the latest in a chain of bombings that have killed two people. The two FedEx bomb incidents hours apart on Tuesday morning brought to six the number of explosive devices - five of them detonated - that have come under investigation in Texas this month as the work of a suspected serial bomber. Baffled investigators have taken the extraordinary step of issuing public appeals through the media asking that whoever is responsible to at least come forward with a demand or an explanation. Adding to tensions, police and federal agents said that a third package they described as an “incendiary device” went off Tuesday evening in Austin, the Texas capital, injuring a man there. But police and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) said they had no reason to believe that incident, reported to have occurred at a thrift shop for the charity Goodwill Industries, was related to any of the others or the act of a “copy cat.” All but one of incidents have occurred in Austin. The exception came early on Tuesday when a package filled with nails and metal shrapnel exploded at about 12:30 a.m. on a conveyer belt at FedEx distribution center near San Antonio, knocking a female employee off her feet, officials said.  The package was being sent from Austin to another address in the city and passed through a sorting facility in the town of Schertz, about 65 miles (105 km) away. Authorities said the worker was treated for her injuries at the scene. Later in the morning, authorities were alerted to a suspicious package at a separate FedEx facility in Austin. Police and federal agents called to the scene found the package contained a bomb and it “was disrupted by law enforcement,” according to a joint statement from Austin police, the ATF and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. No injuries were reported, the statement said. The three agencies said investigators had determined that the two FedEx bombs “are connected” to the four other bomb blasts that occurred between March 2 and March 18 in Austin, killing two people and injuring four others. But ATF and police said the incident Tuesday evening in south Austin “does not appear to be related” to the previous bombings. Local emergency services officials said the victim, a man in his 30, was treated for minor burns and released. A FedEx manager told Reuters the company would begin conducting special safety screenings of packages at its facilities in Schertz and Austin where Tuesday’s incidents occurred. Speaking through the media, officials have appealed to the bomber to reveal the motives for the attacks and have asked the public for any tips, offering a $115,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. “Somebody has to know something,” FBI spokeswoman Christina Garza said. “The person behind these explosives, please, we want to know why.” “This is obviously a very, very sick individual, or maybe individuals,” President Donald Trump told reporters. “These are sick people, and we will get to the bottom of it.” The four previous explosions killed two people and injured four others, unnerving residents of Austin, a city of some 1 million people. The first bombings occurred as the state capital was hosting the annual South By Southwest music, film and technology festival The first three devices were parcel bombs dropped off in front of homes in different Austin neighborhoods. The fourth went off on Sunday night on the west side of the city and was described by police as a more sophisticated device detonated through a trip wire.

580,FDX,RPT-FedEx to scan every parcel at two Texas facilities after blast,"(Repeats with no changes) By Eric M. Johnson March 21 (Reuters) - FedEx Corp will screen every package at the Texas facility where a parcel exploded on Tuesday, according to a FedEx manager, describing extraordinary steps the company is taking in response to a series of bombings in the state capital. The package delivery company will also X-ray entire truckloads of parcels at its sorting facility outside Austin, and then divert them elsewhere for sorting and delivery, said the FedEx employee who was not authorized to speak on the record. The source does not work at the sorting facility but was briefed on the situation. FedEx spokesman Jim McCluskey said he had no immediate comment. The blast at FedEx on Tuesday was one of six explosions in Texas in the past 18 days. The attacks have killed two people, injured others and left hundreds of federal and local investigators scrambling to find the perpetrator and a motive. Package screening is not routine at the nation’s big delivery companies such as FedEx, United Parcel Service Inc or the U.S. Postal Service. The industry delivers a total of around 40 million parcels in the United States each day, industry experts said. Checking every package on a regular basis would virtually paralyze their operations. FedEx will carry out the special screenings at the sorting facility in Schertz, Texas where the package exploded, injuring one worker, and at a second location in Austin, where another explosive device was found, the employee said.

581,FDX,FedEx to scan every parcel at two Texas facilities after blast,"(Reuters) - FedEx Corp will screen every package at the Texas facility where a parcel exploded on Tuesday, according to a FedEx manager, describing extraordinary steps the company is taking in response to a series of bombings in the state capital.  The package delivery company will also X-ray entire truckloads of parcels at its sorting facility outside Austin, and then divert them elsewhere for sorting and delivery, said the FedEx employee who was not authorized to speak on the record. The source does not work at the sorting facility but was briefed on the situation. FedEx spokesman Jim McCluskey said he had no immediate comment. The blast at FedEx on Tuesday was one of five explosions in Texas in the past 18 days. A sixth explosion on Tuesday night did not appear related, authorities said. The five attacks have killed two people, injured others and left hundreds of federal and local investigators scrambling to find the perpetrator and a motive. Package screening is not routine at the nation’s big delivery companies such as FedEx, United Parcel Service Inc or the U.S. Postal Service. The industry delivers a total of around 40 million parcels in the United States each day, industry experts said. Checking every package on a regular basis would virtually paralyze their operations. FedEx will carry out the special screenings at the sorting facility in Schertz, Texas where the package exploded, injuring one worker, and at a second location in Austin, where another explosive device was found, the employee said.

584,FDX,FBI reminds couriers on suspicious package protocols after Texas bombings,"(Reuters) - The FBI has reminded parcel delivery companies in the United States to follow “established protocols” for handling suspicious packages following a bomb blast at a FedEx Corp (FDX.N) sorting facility in Texas, an agency spokeswoman said on Wednesday. A three-week bombing spree, which sent a shiver through the Texas capital of Austin and rattled the rest of the country, raised fears about the possibility of other attackers via package delivery. “In light of the bombings in Austin the FBI has reached out to our private-sector partners to remind them of established protocols of how to handle suspicious packages,” Federal Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Lindsay Ram said by email. There was no suggestion by the FBI that FedEx had not followed protocols to the letter. Federal prosecutors said on Wednesday they had charged Mark Conditt of Pflugerville, Texas, with unlawful possession and transfer of a destructive device before he blew himself up as police closed in on his vehicle. FedEx, United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and other couriers collect a vast amount of data on packages in their systems. Some of the information may have helped identify the man who carried out the bombings, a FedEx executive said. FedEx Chief Operations Officer David Bronczek told employees in an internal memo seen by Reuters that the company provided “key evidence” to law enforcement officials on identifying the suspect. The FBI’s Ram did not elaborate on whether the agency was concerned about other deadly packages that may have slipped into a mail network that handles roughly 40 million parcels daily in the United States. FedEx was taking the extraordinary step of screening every package at the sorting facility outside Austin where a parcel bomb exploded on a conveyor belt on Tuesday. It was also x-raying entire trailers filled with packages at that location and other trailers with packages originating from central Texas, a FedEx manager said. FedEx spokesman Jim McCluskey declined to comment on package screening and on the evidence FedEx provided authorities. Like FedEx, UPS shipping terms and conditions allow employees to open and inspect packages, and the companies train employees on how to respond if they see packages that look suspicious or may contain drugs. FedEx and UPS have so far not described steps they may take to expand screening.  UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara said the company constantly evaluates and adjusts its security measures, but does not discuss them in order to maintain their effectiveness. The United States Postal Service said in a statement that although it appeared none of the devices in Austin were sent through the U.S. mail, USPS reminded employees and customers to be observant about suspicious packages. Inspectors in its Dangerous Mail Investigations Program “are trained to recognize the common characteristics of suspicious mail and are highly proficient in the use of state-of-the-art equipment to include portable X-ray machines,” the USPS said. The FedEx manager said in-bound international shipments are screened by x-ray or bomb-sniffing dogs, and said the Texas blast could lead to changes in domestic security screening. Airport-like security measures inside package sorting facilities and retail locations would be a costly and unnecessary step that would paralyze operations, particularly given the rarity of package bombs, said Satish Jindel, a founder of the delivery company that became FedEx Ground.

588,FDX,UPDATE 5-Amazon finishes higher despite Trump's new threat on shipping rates,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The largest American business lobby group came to the defense of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) on Tuesday after a multi-day Twitter attack by U.S. President Donald Trump that included unsubstantiated criticism of the world’s biggest online retailer. The value of Amazon (AMZN.O) shares held by Jeff Bezos, the online retailer’s chief executive and single largest shareholder, had taken a $10 billion hit in the week since Trump began attacking him and his company on Twitter. Citing an unspecified report, Trump told reporters at the White House that the company was not paying the U.S. Postal Service a fair rate, and that it was costing U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars and forcing other retailers out of business, and he threatened to raise rates. Late on Tuesday afternoon, a source familiar with proceedings at the White House said no specific actions addressing Trump’s concerns about Amazon were on the table at the White House at this time, but that could change given Trump’s dissatisfaction with the company.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest business lobby group in the country, stepped in on Tuesday to defend Amazon, which is a member. “It’s inappropriate for government officials to use their position to attack an American company,” Neil Bradley, chief policy officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement, citing the value of the free enterprise system and the rule of law. “The record is clear: deviating from those processes undermines economic growth and job creation.” It is not the first time Trump, or another U.S. president, has been publicly critical of a company. Trump has previously criticized automakers, Carrier Corp, which is owned by United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N). In 2015, then-President Barack Obama criticized office supply company Staples Inc for not embracing the Affordable Care Act, drawing a quick rebuke from Republicans and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Trump has progressively escalated his criticism of Amazon and Bezos, who also privately owns The Washington Post, which has published stories that have angered the president. Bezos, ranked by Forbes magazine as the world’s richest man with an estimated net worth of $115.6 billion, owns 78.89 million Amazon shares, worth about $110 billion at Tuesday’s market close. Amazon shares closed up 1.5 percent at $1,392.05. The shares started the day higher but fell as low as $1,355.33 after Trump’s latest Amazon-related tweet. Trump has accused Amazon of not paying enough tax, taking advantage of the U.S. postal system and putting small retailers out of business, but he has offered no evidence to back up his criticisms. “The post office is losing billions of dollars ... because it delivers packages for Amazon at a very low rate,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday. “If you look at the cost that we’re subsidizing, we’re giving a subsidy to Amazon.” Trump offered no details about the report he cited or how he might charge the company more through USPS. Amazon also ships packages through providers such as FedEx Corp (FDX.N) and United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) as well as its own experimental shipping service. Representatives of Amazon and USPS had no comment on Trump’s tweet on Tuesday and could not be immediately reached regarding his latest comments to reporters.

592,FDX,"MetLife to provide pension benefits to 41,000 FedEx retirees through annuity","(Reuters) - U.S. insurer MetLife Inc (MET.N) has entered into an agreement to provide pension benefits for about 41,000 FedEx Corp (FDX.N) retirees and beneficiaries through an annuity, the two companies said on Tuesday. MetLife and FedEx expect to close the deal, which includes about $6 billion in pension obligations, on May 10, they said. The deal is the first “jumbo-sized” U.S. transfer of pension obligations to an insurer, measured by premium, since 2013, wrote Wells Fargo Securities LLC analyst Sean Dargan in a research note late on Tuesday.  It also marks MetLife’s entry into the market for jumbo-sized transfers, Dargan wrote. The insurer has historically competed for pension transfer deals with less than $1 million in premiums, Dargan wrote.  Some life insurers, including Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N) and  MetLife, take over corporate pension plans from companies that want to offload them. The insurers then use a group annuity to make regular payments to the retirees and beneficiaries who are entitled to benefits under those pensions. These deals, known as pension risk transfers, have been around for at least 90 years, but rising interest rates and stock market values are expected to make it easier for more companies unload their plans to insurers. In 2017, MetLife disclosed that it had failed to make payments to pensioners whom it could not locate after taking over their plans from private companies. MetLife since been trying to locate the individuals, whom it intends to pay, the company has said. The deal “is a vote of confidence after MET’s group annuitant issues and charges of the recent past,” Dargan wrote. FedEx’s purchase of the group annuity contract will be funded by assets of its pension plan, the company said.  The amount of monthly payments to the pensioners will not change, the companies said.
