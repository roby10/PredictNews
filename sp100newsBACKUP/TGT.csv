1,TGT,"Retail, tech lead Wall Street rally before jobs data","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks closed sharply higher and the Nasdaq notched an eighth day of gains on Thursday as improved labor market and retail sales data added to optimism a day before the critical June payrolls report.  Equities have been on a tear recently as improving economic data and a potential resolution to Greece’s fiscal issues paved over fears of slowing growth and contagion stemming from the euro zone’s debt crisis.  The Nasdaq’s 8.3 percent gain over the past eight trading sessions is the most for the index in two years and the S&P’s 6.7 percent rise is its best since September 2010, as the market reacted to news of the Fed’s second round of stimulus. The Dow is up 6.6 percent over the same period.  “It’s all about the data today, which was great, and is causing people to revise their outlooks up for tomorrow,” said Jeffrey Friedman, senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago. “We passed through a resistance level of 1,352 on the S&P, and the next stop after that could be new highs for the year.”  All 10 S&P sectors rose, led by materials .GSPM, which gained 1.5 percent, while Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold (FCX.N) climbed 3.7 percent to $55.49.  Both the S&P retail index .RLX and the Dow Jones Transportation Average .DJT hit all-time highs.  Data from payrolls processor ADP showed U.S. private-sector employers added 157,000 jobs last month, more than double what was expected. The report, coupled with a fall in new claims for jobless benefits, raised hopes that a recent slowdown in the economy may only be temporary.  The report fueled speculation that Friday’s non-farm payrolls report from the Labor Department would provide more evidence of an improving labor market, a key factor if markets are to rally into the end of the year.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI shot up 93.47 points, or 0.74 percent, to 12,719.49. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX gained 14 points, or 1.05 percent, to 1,353.22. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC climbed 38.64 points, or 1.36 percent, to 2,872.66.  The market’s rally has some analysts calling for a near-term pullback.  “I can’t make a case from this rally that we’re home clear,” said James Meyer, chief investment officer of Tower Bridge Advisers in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. “We’ve gone from the bottom of the range to the top, and I suspect trading will be choppy around here.”  Retailers were among the best performers after several top companies reported better-than-expected sales gains for June, using bargains to lure shoppers in an uncertain economy.  Target Corp (TGT.N) jumped 6.7 percent to $51.67 while Macy’s Inc (M.N) added 5.5 percent to $30.46 and Gap Inc (GPS.N) gained 5.2 percent to $19.28.

3,TGT,Chains' deals won over shoppers in June,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top U.S. retailers reported better-than-expected June sales after luring shoppers with targeted bargains that they will now have to keep in place to satisfy shoppers through the summer.  The 25 chains tracked in the Thomson Reuters sales tally reported a 6.5 percent gain in sales at stores open at least a year, beating the 4.9 percent rise that analysts expected.  “It’s a good sign that the consumer is feeling good and prepared to spend appropriately,” Macy’s Inc (M.N) Chief Executive Terry Lundgren told Reuters.  All but four of the chains reported increases, suggesting retailers by and large are savvier about offering discounts without the panicked price-slashing they resorted to in 2008. The level of discounting showed that retailers are seeking the right strategies as the back-to-school shopping season begins.  “They are very focused on making the right offer to the consumer, in contrast to the uneducated sales we saw during the crisis,” said Janet Hoffman, global managing director for Accenture’s Retail Practice. “The sales now are much more targeted.”  J.C. Penney (JCP.N) was a notable exception, missing estimates and cutting its quarterly earnings forecast after it had to do too much discounting. Its shares fell 1.5 percent.  For a graphic with the sales results, see r.reuters.com/caq52s BACK-TO-SCHOOL BARGAIN HUNTING  Shoppers have some economic momentum pushing them to open their wallets. Gasoline prices have retreated from recent highs and the job market appears to be improving.  U.S. private employers added far more jobs than expected in June, bouncing back from a surprise slump the month before, a report by a payrolls processor showed.  The International Council of Shopping Centers expects retailers to keep their momentum in July, forecasting a same-store sales jump of 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent.  But many analysts caution against reading too much into the strong numbers from June, since that is when retailers typically cut prices on spring and summer items to make room for back-to-school and fall merchandise.  Stores will probably have to keep offering discounts during back-to-school, which accounts for about one-sixth of total retail sales and is the most important shopping period after the holiday season.  “July is where consumers can pull back and think about where they can get bargains,” said David Bassuk, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners.  Shoppers said early deals prompted them to spend.  Lizzie Widhelm, a 33-year-old mother of three from Pacific Palisades, California, already has bought uniforms and backpacks. “There were such good early sales,” she said.  Only three of 24 chains that Wall Street tracks missed expectations.  The Standard & Poor's Retail Index .RLX rose as much as 2.8 percent to a new high, outpacing the S&P 500's .SPX 1 percent increase. Target Corp (TGT.N) shares rose 7 percent and Hot Topic HOTT.O jumped 13 percent, while Dillard's hit an all-time high. Shares of Macy's and Nordstrom reached peaks not seen since late 2007.  Macy’s Lundgren said the fight was still on for middle-class shoppers.  “All boats are rising in the luxury segment of the business, but I think the middle market is much more of a market share game,” Lundgren said.  Macy’s, continuing a streak of strong gains, said same-store sales rose 6.7 percent in June, and raised its quarterly sales forecast.  Penney conceded that it had to use more promotions to try to win over its shoppers, who have more modest incomes than patrons of Macy’s and are more exposed to the economy’s ups and downs.  Penney now expects quarterly same-store sales to rise about 1 to 2 percent, down from its prior forecast of 3 to 4 percent. It forecast quarterly earnings of 6 cents per share, including charges, down from May’s outlook of 20 to 24 cents, including about 6 cents in charges.  Penney rivals Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N) and Dillard’s (DDS.N) fared much better. Kohl’s, where same-store sales were up 7.5 percent, has benefited by having exclusive merchandise that accounts for half of its sales. Its shares were up nearly 7 percent.  Macy’s got help from its upscale Bloomingdale’s chain. High-end department store chains Saks Inc SKS.N and Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) easily beat Wall Street forecasts.  Retailers are starting to raise clothing prices to reflect higher cotton costs. At least at Macy’s, shoppers have not pushed back so far, Lundgren said.

Thursday’s data from payrolls processor ADP showed U.S. private hiring increased by 157,000 in June, well above the expected 68,000, bouncing back from a surprise slump the month before. For details, see [ID:nEAPA70EH0]   In a separate report, new claims for unemployment benefits fell slightly more than expected last week, although distortions due to a holiday and other factors made interpretation difficult. [ID:nOAT004827]   Still, stock futures climbed after the reports on speculation Friday’s non-farm payrolls report from the Labor Department would benefit stocks.   “They are absolutely going to look at ADP and they are going to use it as another reason to buy the market — clearly people are going to say tomorrow’s (jobs) number is going to be even better because this is only private payrolls,” said Ken Polcari, managing director at ICAP Equities in New York.   “We have seen with this market that it has ignored everything negative. They have taken anything they can sink their teeth into that is slightly positive. Today they are just taking this (ADP) number and they are running with it.”   S&P 500 futures SPc1 rose 12.6 points and were well above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 gained 92 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures NDc1 added 22.75 points.   Employers are expected to have added 90,000 jobs in June in Friday’s Labor Department report, according to a poll of economists by Reuters.   Retailers will also be in focus as they release monthly sales data. Top U.S. retailers are on pace to report better-than-expected sales gains for June after bargains lured shoppers contending with high gasoline prices and a wobbly economy. [ID:nN1E76602K]   Target Corp (TGT.N) shares jumped 6.8 percent to $51.75 and Macy’s Inc (M.N) added 3.2 percent to $29.80 in premarket trade.   Investors may be optimistic about a resolution to the U.S. debt ceiling debate as President Barack Obama and top congressional leaders were aiming for “something big” when they resume budget talks on Thursday to avert a default soon after weeks of impasse. For details, see [ID:nN1E76523G]   However, a small team of U.S. Treasury officials is discussing options to stave off default if Congress fails to raise the country’s borrowing limit by an Aug. 2 deadline, sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

6,TGT,"IPO view: Toys R Us IPO taking shape slowly, now seen in 2012","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Selling Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels to children may prove far easier than hawking Toys R Us TOY.UL to investors.  The New Jersey-based company behind the iconic dolls and model cars filed its IPO paperwork in May 2010 but is now not expected to go public until 2012, two sources told Reuters.  Toys R Us has made it through the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission review process, so it could launch an IPO any time it wants — yet it is expected to delay the offering until next year, one of the sources said.  The sources declined to be named as the information is not public. Toys R Us, which operates stores under its own brand as well as the Babies R Us and FAO Schwarz banners, declined to comment.  A decision to wait boils down to basic concerns about the markets and the travails of being a retailer with more than 40 percent of its annual sales coming from the holiday season.  There are two big windows left this year for U.S. IPOs. The summer window began this week, after the July 4 holiday, and will last until mid-August when much of Wall Street heads for the Hamptons. The fall window opens after the U.S. Labor Day holiday in September, shuts temporarily for Thanksgiving, and lasts till mid- to late December.  Some of the immediate concerns about Greece’s debt have eased but markets are wary of a crisis in Portugal. There is also still no deal on the debt ceiling and the unemployment rate just climbed to a six-month high.  That means a tough IPO market, at least in the near term. Toys R Us is planning to wait out the summer window because of macroeconomic uncertainties, one of the sources said.  In general, there is less optimism about consumer and retail IPOs in the second half of the year. A survey of 100 investment bankers by accounting firm BDO USA last month showed that more than 40 percent of those surveyed expect consumer and retail IPOs to be flat and 36 percent expect them to decrease. For a related graphic, r.reuters.com/heq52s Even if markets improve come fall, that would be a difficult time for Toys R Us to go public. Having an IPO in the autumn could be inconvenient with the retailer in the thick of preparations for the all-important holiday selling season.  “If they don’t go public within the next one or two months, they probably have to wait until after the holidays to go public,” Wedbush analyst Edward Woo said.  “Holidays are very, very important for them,” Woo said. “It is unlikely they will want to do it during the time they have their (holiday) sales. That will probably be distracting.”  Another industry source agreed: “Once you get past August, you are in prime shipping season. All the products (will be) coming in. You have got to set your stores. You have got to run your promos. From September to December, nothing else will get done besides preparing for holiday.”  Toys R Us first went public in April 1978 and operated as a public company until July 2005, when it was taken private by Bain Capital Partners LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co (KKR.N) and Vornado Realty Trust (VNO.N) in a $6.6 billion deal.  Toys R Us CEO Jerry Storch told the Reuters Consumer and Retail Summit last week that an initial public offering would depend on both the state of the markets and on company-specific factors.  The retailer reported a wider net loss and a 2.1 percent decline in U.S. same-store sales in its first quarter ended April 30. While it gained market share from mass discounters including Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) in the fourth quarter, its 2010 Christmas sales were still weaker-than-expected.  The company and its private equity backers were discussing whether they might get a higher price if they allow the company more time to recover from weaker-than-expected Christmas sales, a source told Reuters in April.

Since late 2005, the SEC and CFTC have ordered $12.3 billion in penalties for alleged wrongdoing. But more than $4.5 billion hasn’t been paid yet.	   * Silicon Valley’s technology boom is giving a lift to the venture-capital industry. But many of the gains are being disproportionately reaped by brand-name venture firms, which are benefiting from a wave of Internet IPOs and the soaring valuations of closely held companies such as Facebook Inc.	   * A long list of U.S. businesses have been waiting for Congress to ratify trade deals that would reduce big tariffs in South Korea, Colombia and Panama, but that still hasn’t happened and the delays are taking a toll.	   * NYSE Euronext investor-owners approved a plan to merge with German exchange operator Deutsche Börse, moving ahead a plan to create the biggest exchange group in the world.	   * Tobacco bonds were stars in June, rising an average of 10 percent with some up more than 60 percent. The big beneficiaries were hedge funds that scooped them up after many muni-bond funds were forced to sell months earlier, often at a big loss.	   * Retailers reported solid sales for June, although the gains were aided by significant promotions. Macy’s , Kohl’s  , Target , Costco and Limited Brands  were among those that beat estimates.	   * China’s retail megastore sector is about to get a megadose of new competition. A billion-dollar share sale planned by Sun Art Retail Group Ltd is likely to give the operator of retail megastores in China a powerful new war chest that it can use to extend its advantage over rivals Wal-Mart Stores Inc  and Carrefour SA in one of the world’s most competitive and fastest-growing retail industries.

Having an IPO in the autumn could be inconvenient with the retailer in the thick of preparations for the all-important holiday selling season.  “If they don’t go public within the next one or two months, they probably have to wait until after the holidays to go public,” Wedbush analyst Edward Woo said.  “Holidays are very, very important for them,” Woo said. “It is unlikely they will want to do it during the time they have their (holiday) sales. That will probably be distracting.”  Another industry source agreed: “Once you get past August, you are in prime shipping season. All the products (will be) coming in. You have got to set your stores. You have got to run your promos. From September to December, nothing else will get done besides preparing for holiday.”  Toys R Us first went public in April 1978 and operated as a public company until July 2005, when it was taken private by Bain Capital Partners LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co and Vornado Realty Trust in a $6.6 billion deal.  Toys R Us CEO Jerry Storch told the Reuters Consumer and Retail Summit last week that an initial public offering would depend on both the state of the markets and on company-specific factors.  The retailer reported a wider net loss and a 2.1 percent decline in U.S. same-store sales in its first quarter ended April 30. While it gained market share from mass discounters including Wal-Mart Stores Inc in the fourth quarter, its 2010 Christmas sales were still weaker-than-expected.  The company and its private equity backers were discussing whether they might get a higher price if they allow the company more time to recover from weaker-than-expected Christmas sales, a source told Reuters in April.

15,TGT,Union grocers stuck in California pressure cooker,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A high-stakes supermarket labor dispute in southern California, the nation’s toughest and most trend-setting food retail market, is exposing the challenges facing the grocery business and its union workers.  In 2003, the region played host to the longest work stoppage in the history of the U.S. grocery industry. That bitter, four-and-a-half-month standoff shifted more than $1 billion in sales, and the loyalty of some shoppers, to competitors.  Back then, the threat was Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s push into groceries. The growth of Wal-Mart and other nonunion food sellers has turned southern California into one of the hardest markets for union supermarkets to prosper.  Now, union membership is dwindling among U.S. retail workers, along with the market share controlled by unionized grocers. As in many union battles across the country, a big issue is who should pay for rising healthcare costs.  “The grocers don’t want to pick up that tab if their competitors don’t have to do it,” said supermarket consultant David Livingston.  Experts said many other U.S. markets may one day mirror California’s diversity and hyper-competitiveness.  “California tends to be the leading indicator for the rest of the United States,” said Burt Flickinger, managing director of retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group.  Southern California workers and management side-stepped a strike in 2007, but the threat of another stoppage is back.  The 62,000 employees of Ralphs, Vons and Albertsons stores have been without a contract since it expired in March. They have authorized a strike and have been busy picketing.  Ralphs owner Kroger, Vons owner Safeway and Albertsons owner Supervalu are negotiating as a group — adding complexity to the talks.  Grocery employees are members of seven union locals. The biggest is United Food and Commercial Workers Local 770.  This time, the retailers and the unions face unprecedented pressure, Flickinger said.  In the 1970s and 1980s, Albertsons, Vons, Ralphs and Stater Bros, a private, unionized supermarket chain not involved in the negotiations, controlled close to 90 percent of the southern California retail food market. That has fallen to less than 40 percent, Flickinger said.  The number of union retail workers also has shrunk.  Union membership among U.S. retail workers fell from a high of 933,000 in 2003 to 687,000 in 2010 — a decline of more than 26 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which does not break out figures for individual states.  Southern California is now crowded with nonunion rivals including Wal-Mart, Costco, Tesco’s Fresh & Easy, Whole Foods Market, Trader Joe’s, Winco, Hispanic supermarkets like Superior Grocers and deep discounters such as 99 Cents Only Stores. Even Target is adding grocery sections more than 100 existing stores in the area.  Those colliding trends have made southern California home to some of the most contentious supermarket labor battles.  “My hope is that cooler heads prevail ... It is in no one’s interest to have a strike,” said Walter Stackow, senior research analyst at Manning & Napier, which owns shares of Kroger, Safeway and Supervalu.  While Kroger has outperformed Safeway and Supervalu, analysts said supermarket profits are not growing.  Kroger and some other grocers have made progress closing the price gap with Wal-Mart, which has pulled away from short-term deep discounts and is focusing on low prices and matching rivals’ advertised prices.  Labor costs remain a hot issue because every penny of expense counts when retailers compete on price.  The unions say supermarket operators want workers to shoulder a burdensome share of their own healthcare costs.  “As it is, I barely make enough money to make ends meet,” said Lisa Marie Wheeler, 41, a checker at Vons in San Pedro. The single mother of four works two part-time jobs.  “If I have to pay more just to keep the insurance, and then more for the costs that they don’t cover, where will I be? I’ll be devastated,” said Wheeler.  Kroger spokesman Keith Dailey said workers’ healthcare cost increases would be modest, and that the proposal on the table will not lower the grocer’s healthcare costs, only moderate future cost increases. Safeway and Supervalu declined comment.  “The irony is, the harder they each pull on the rope, the higher the likelihood that the damage to both parties will be bigger,” Bill Bishop, chairman of consultancy Willard Bishop, said of the negotiations.

18,TGT,Tengelmann expects to exit A&P; in bankruptcy process," MUEHLHEIM AN DER RUHR, Germany, July 14 (Reuters) - German retailer Tengelmann expects to exit its holding in Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea (A&P) GAPTQ.PK when the U.S. grocery store chain emerges from bankruptcy protection.   “We hope that A&P can be led out of its insolvency. But we do not believe that we will be significant shareholders after the process ends,” Tengelmann Chief Executive Karl-Erivan Haub told reporters on Thursday.   A&P, once the largest U.S. grocer, filed for bankruptcy protection in December as it ran low on cash and was squeezed by discounters like Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N).   “A&P is currently in freefall,” Tengelmann’s Chief Financial Officer Jens-Juergen Boeckel said.   Tengelmann, which owns about 38 percent of A&P, said last year it expected the company to be combined with another retailer in the long term. It has now fully written off the value of its stake in A&P.   Haub also said on Thursday that Tengelmann’s home improvement store chain OBI would not take over peer Praktiker PRAG.DE, in part or in whole.   Praktiker declined to comment on the matter.

19,TGT,Mattel 2nd-quarter profit tops Wall Street estimates,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mattel Inc (MAT.O), the world’s largest toy company, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on strong sales of its Barbie dolls and toys based on the “Cars 2” movie.  The sales increase shows the growing global reach of Mattel. International sales increased 12 percent, excluding currency fluctuations.  “They’re looking to have a great year,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Edward Woo. “They’ve gained market share and they’re likely to continue to maintain that momentum into the holiday season.”  The shares had been up more than five percent, but they gave back some of their gains because they are getting close to their fair value, said MKM Partners analyst Eric Handler, whose price target is $28.  Now the question is whether the shares will keep rising in the run-up to the holidays.  Woo thinks that could happen and his price target is under review. The company is in a position to grow earnings by at least 10 percent on a revenue increase in the mid to high single digits, he said.  “Barbie is getting big internationally,” said Handler. “The whole company has become more internationally focused.”  The maker of Hot Wheels cars and Fisher-Price toys said second-quarter net profit rose to $80.5 million, or 23 cents per share, from with $51.6 million, 14 cents per share, last year.  U.S. toy companies, which make most of their toys in China, are grappling with rising costs of plastics, packaging paper, freight and labor. Mattel’s gross margins fell 20 basis points.  “Costs have been rising, but it’s manageable for them,” Woo said.  Sales at the company, which counts Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Toys R Us TOYS.N TOY.UL and Target Corp (TGT.N) as its biggest customers, rose 14 percent to $1.16 billion.  Analysts on average expected earnings of 16 cents a share, on sales $1.11 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The company’s shares were up nearly 2 percent at $27.29 in midday trading. They have risen 6.3 percent so far in 2011. They trade at about 13.1 times forward earnings, well above the sector average of 7.9. Rival Hasbro Inc’s (HAS.O) shares trade at a multiple of about 13.9.  ",7152011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mattel/mattel-2nd-quarter-profit-tops-wall-street-estimates-idUSTRE76E2Z920110715
20,TGT,Frugal is in: deals to drive back-to-school shopping for clothes,"BANGALORE (Reuters) - For young Americans, frugal dressing is in this back-to-school season.  Retailers like Abercombie & Fitch (ANF.N), Aeropostale ARO.N and Zumiez (ZUMZ.O) may be showing off offers and promotions, but shoppers on skimpy budgets want to wait it out or check with value retailers for the best deals this season.  The back-to-school season — the second-largest shopping period in the United States — kicks off in July and runs through Labor Day in early September.  “The good news is that we’re up against soft numbers (from last year), the bad news is that teens still don’t have jobs and they still don’t have discretionary income,” said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at retail market researcher NPD Group.  Consultants Challenger, Gray & Christmas, citing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said employment among 16- to 19-year-olds increased by 960,000 jobs from May through July — the lowest level of summer hiring in over 60 years.  Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rivera is a case in point.  Window shopping with her mother at Harlem-Irving Plaza in Norridge, Illinois, she was looking for deals to replenish her wardrobe. She didn’t have a job, and said she prefers Target (TGT.N) and Kohl’s (KSS.N) for her back-to-school shopping.  “I like PacSun PSUN.O but it’s expensive there. They don’t have good deals,” she said.  Like Rivera, 19-year-old Scott Gamm, student at New York University’s Stern School of Business and founder of personal finance website helpsavemydollars.com, said most of his purchases would be for school necessities, and he is waiting “till the end to find the best deals.”  A poll of its roughly 12,000 members by NPD showed shoppers have roughly the same budget as last year for clothes and shoes.  But, having been trained to bargain hunt, people are more likely to play smart.  Retailers like Target Corp, (TGT.N), Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N), JC Penney (JCP.N), Limited Brands LTD.N and Children’s Place (PLCE.O) and Wet Seal WTSLA.O, which offer better deals, are expected to outdo others.  “They will be able to go to Abercrombie or American Eagle for one or two things, but the balance of the clothes is going to come from better value-oriented retailers,” Cohen said.  Specialty clothes retailers are going to see very quickly that the consumer will not rush in, that they will prioritize their spending more on essentials, and fashion retailers are not going to get a July or even a early August push this year.  This season, clothes will be about 10 percent pricier than last year as companies, hurt by rising raw material costs, pass on these costs to shoppers.  At the same time, high gasoline prices and a 9.2 percent unemployment rate are still weighing on household budgets.  “You will see consumers disappointed when they reach for a pair of jeans at Abercrombie for $110, which was selling last year at about $80-$90,” Brian Sozzi, analyst with Wall Street Strategies, said.  A PriceGrabber survey said 48 percent of shoppers polled by them were planning to spend $250 or more on back-to-school purchases, down from last year’s 56 percent. People planning to spend $500 or more fell from 31 percent to 25 percent.  Manufacturers typically start shipping fresh merchandise to retailers during spring, in time to hit stores by mid summer.  With shoppers waiting on last minute discounts, it is getting difficult for stores to gauge customer sentiment and bet on when to increase discounts to push out inventory.  As customers keep pushing back their purchases, “the secret hope would be that the (supply) chain moves later in the year, but that’s not what’s happening,” said Pierre Mercier, partner and supply-chain expert with the Boston Consulting Group said.  “It’s still about who gets there first,” Mercier said, adding that on the inventory front, “at this point in time, it’s too late for retailers to fix things.”  Though the days of 80-percent-off-on-everything are over, retailers need to plan targeted discounts to avoid getting stuck with stuff that won’t sell.  For example, instead of a flat buy-one-get-one-free, what could appeal to shoppers more is an offer of a discount on a t-shirt on the purchase of a pair of jeans.  “They aren’t going to go shopping for back-to-school clothing 5 times. They’re going to do it once and are going to look for the right product at the right price,” said Cohen.

However, the company, whose brands include Hanes, Champion and Wonderbra, may get a boost at least from cotton prices which have recently fallen from the all-time highs they reached in March.	   The Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based company expects third-quarter earnings to rise 30 percent from a year ago. This implies earnings of 82 cents per share, which is below analysts’ average estimate of 92 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.	   Hanesbrands reported second-quarter net income of $86.8 million, or 87 cents a share, compared with $85.4 million, or 87 cents a share, a year ago.	   Sales rose 14 percent to $1.23 billion.

23,TGT,Wal-Mart to once again share U.S. store data,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) will no longer keep a tight lid on its U.S. sales data after agreeing to share information with outside research firms to help it better understand how and why customers make choices.  The world’s largest retailer said on Thursday it would provide sales data from its U.S. Walmart chain to Nielsen Holdings NV (NLSN.N), bolstering an industry benchmark that has lacked Walmart’s sales data for more than a decade.  Walmart has posted two straight years of declining sales at stores open at least a year, an industry metric known as same-store sales, as rivals chip away at its dominant market position. It aims to return to growth sometime this year.  Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club warehouse club chain was already sharing data with outside firms.  SymphonyIRI said it would soon announce a similar pact with Walmart, which accounts for close to 11 percent of total U.S. retail sales. Wal-Mart will use research from the firms to better understand its customers.  Nielsen and SymphonyIRI gather and analyze sales data from U.S. chain stores ranging from grocery stores such as Kroger Co (KR.N) to mass merchants such as Target Corp (TGT.N) to give manufacturers, Wall Street analysts and others insight into how various products are selling.  Without Walmart, the widely used data did not include the country’s largest retailer. Walmart rang up $260.3 billion in sales in its latest fiscal year. U.S. retail sales topped $2.37 trillion in 2010, according to the National Retail Federation.  The change is important for companies such as chocolate manufacturer Hershey Co (HSY.N) and household products maker Clorox Co (CLX.N) , which depend on Wal-Mart for a quarter or more of their sales.  Companies that sell their goods to Walmart were already able to see some performance data, but generally could not see how their sales stacked up against competitors.  “This is a very big deal, to know how these companies’ products are selling at Walmart,” said Dave Kolpak, an analyst at Victory Capital Management.  Unlike many other chains, Walmart does not have a loyalty card, which can help retailers track how shoppers spend their money, what times of day they buy, how much they are buying on sale or with coupons, and other data.  Wal-Mart appears ready to figure out the best way to use its data and work with outsiders to gain more insights.  In February, it named Sam’s Club executive Cindy Davis as the executive vice president of global customer insights, a new team that is studying customer trends.  Along with sharing its data, Walmart will also use Nielsen as its primary provider for market information, tools and training.  SymphonyIRI said it was working on a similar data agreement and that it would become Walmart’s preferred provider of shopper insights, an area that Walmart is working on.  “Now we just need them to start giving monthly same-store sales again,” said Kolpak.

25,TGT,"UPDATE 2-Loblaw profit rises, cautions on competition","   * EPS C$0.67 vs C$0.64 a year earlier   * Same-store sales down 0.4 percent   * New president to join on Aug. 2   * Shares down 0.08 percent  (Adds details, analyst’s comments, share price; changes per-share figures to diluted from basic)   By S. John Tilak   TORONTO, July 21 (Reuters) - Loblaw Cos Ltd (L.TO), Canada’s No. 1 grocery chain, posted a higher quarterly profit on Thursday but warned that its sales position is at risk due to “unpredictable and competitively intense market conditions”.   Competition in the C$100 billion-plus Canadian grocery sector has heated up greatly in the last three quarters, with Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) expanding its food-stocked supercenters.   Loblaw has historically competed against Metro Inc MRUa.TO and Empire Co Ltd (EMPa.TO), and the three control more than half of the grocery industry. But Wal-Mart and Costco (COST.O) have been gaining share.   Sales at Loblaw stores open for at least a year, a key measure for retailers, dropped 0.4 percent in the second quarter ended June 18. Overall sales rose 0.2 percent.   The results came as newly named Loblaw president, former Carrefour (CARR.PA) executive Vicente Trius, is set to join the company on Aug. 2 and as Canadian retailers prepare for the entry of Target Corp (TGT.N) into the market. Target plans to open its first Canadian stores in two years.   “We are seeing a very cautious consumer that’s very value-driven. People are looking for deals right now,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said.   “What consumers will do is they will cherry pick” and go from one store to another to buy what’s on sale, he said.   Such an environment prompts retailers to get more aggressive in cutting prices to drive store traffic, he added.   Loblaw has been focusing more on its lower-priced banner, No Frills, as uncertain times push consumers are toward discount stores. The competition for No Frills includes FreshCo from Sobeys and Food Basics from Metro.   Target Corp (TGT.N) has said it plans to stock food, though the scope of its offerings is likely to be limited by the size of the stores it has leased. Earlier this year it bought the the leases of Zellers discount department stores from Hudson’s Bay Co.    Loblaw’s earnings rose to C$197 million ($209 million), or 67 Canadian cents a share, in its second quarter from C$181 million, or 64 Canadian cents a share, the year before.   Revenue rose slightly to C$7.28 billion.   The stock slipped 0.08 percent to C$38.28 in the Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday morning.

26,TGT,Wal-Mart to give its U.S. store data to Nielsen,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) has agreed to give its U.S. store data to Nielsen Holdings NV (NLSN.N), bolstering an industry benchmark that has long lacked insights into sales at the world’s largest chain.  Nielsen gathers and analyzes sales information from a variety of U.S. chain stores, giving manufacturers, Wall Street analysts and others a glimpse at how products such as food and detergent are selling — everywhere from grocery stores such as Kroger Co (KR.N) to mass merchants such as Target Corp  (TGT.N).  However, Wal-Mart’s U.S. discount stores had not shared its data in more than a decade, which meant that Nielsen’s widely used metrics were missing the country’s largest retailer in terms of revenue.  Walmart and Sam’s Club stores will now report their sales information to Nielsen, and Nielsen will become Walmart’s primary provider for market information, tools and training, the companies said in a joint announcement on Thursday.  The move comes after Wal-Mart in February named Sam’s Club executive Cindy Davis as the executive vice president of Walmart global customer insights, a new team that is studying customer trends.

27,TGT,"Amazon revenue surges, stock jumps","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc reported a surge in quarterly revenue on sales of its kindle electronic reader and other electronics and forecast far better-than-expected revenue for the current quarter, sending its shares up more than 6 percent.  The largest Internet retailer benefited from growth in e-commerce, though margins continued to be pressured by heavy spending on distribution, technology and digital content.  But the market focused more on sales growth than profits.  “If you look at top-line growth it was extremely strong,” Dan Geiman, analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen, said. “At this point it’s a question of how long the company is going to continue to invest at their current levels. Presuming these investments don’t go on forever, earnings should grow going forward.”  The world’s largest web retailer reported a 51 percent climb in revenue to $9.91 billion, surpassing Wall Street’s expectations for $9.4 billion.  Operating margin fell to 2.0 percent from 4.1 percent a year earlier.  Amazon is investing heavily to build warehouses and distribution to support its main e-commerce business. It is also spending on servers and datacenters for its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, while buying more digital content to bolster media offerings such as streaming video.  The company is expected to introduce a tablet computer later this year that would compete with Apple Inc’s iPad.  Amazon forecast third-quarter sales of $10.3 billion to $11.1 billion, compared with the average forecast for $10.35 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Operating income is expected to be between $20 million and $170 million in the period, the company also estimated. The guidance includes about $180 million of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets. It also assumes no other acquisitions or investments close in the quarter.  Shares of the company, which have risen about 18 percent since the start of 2011, gained 6.3 percent to $227.57 in after-hours trade.  Second-quarter net income came in at $191 million, or 41 cents per share, versus $207 million, or 45 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts expected 35 cents per share for the latest second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Sales in Worldwide Electronics and Other General Merchandise, which includes sales of the Kindle e-reader, computers, cameras and other consumer electronics, jumped 69 percent to $5.89 billion in the second quarter.  Excluding currency fluctuations, sales rose 62 percent.  “That’s very strong,” said Scot Wingo, chief executive of ChannelAdvisor, a software provider that helps retailers sell more online through channels including Amazon and eBay Inc.  “E-commerce in general is growing at 10 percent to 14 percent, so Amazon continues to gobble up market share.” Wingo owns Amazon shares and eBay is an investor in ChannelAdvisor.  Amazon shares have climbed this year as investors are betting the company will benefit as more shopping moves online from traditional retail outlets.  E-commerce sales represent just 6.3 percent of total retail sales, but that may climb to 30 percent in the next five to 10 years, according to a survey this week by investment bank Piper Jaffray.

29,TGT,How to play it: Amazon stock stoked on earnings,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon became the latest Internet company to post stellar earnings this week, after the Internet retailer recorded a 51 percent pop in second-quarter sales.  Amazon was a bright spot in an otherwise rough day for tech stocks on Wednesday. Here are some ways to play the stock’s gains.  Amazon shares rose 6 percent to a year high of $227.20 on earnings momentum on Wednesday — a spike that technology analyst Colin Gillis of BGC Partners says marks a good time to sell. The stock had been trading in a 52-week range of $114.51 to $220.20 and is now up about 24 percent from the start of the year.  “It’s becoming a very momentum-driven name right now,” said Gillis, who warned that any slowing in revenue growth could put the stock at risk. He has a 12-month target of $190.  On the contrarian end, ETF investor Gregory Spear sees a good potential to gain from buying Amazon’s stock “on the dips” and accumulating slowly. Spear is looking for the stock to fall to $219 before buying.  “I wouldn’t buy after a strong earnings announcement,” Spear said. “That’s why it’s up today, and we don’t know how long it will last. If the run-of-the-mill speculation is that it’s going to try to go straight up, you can pretty much bet that it won’t.”  The last time Amazon announced earnings results in late April, the stock rose 8.5 percent the following day, but lost its upward momentum in less than two weeks, gradually sliding back down for the rest of the month.  Amazon’s surge has put other retail stocks at risk of share loss, analysts at William Blair found. Amazon’s prices are 11 percent below retail store prices, the analysts found, which makes it a tough competitor in the Internet retail world.  They assessed the degree of overlap and price differentials of 2,400 randomly selected items at 24 different retailers with those of Amazon to see how much of a threat Amazon’s strength has on retailers with an e-commerce division.  Companies they viewed as facing a potential downside from Amazon’s surge include Bed Bath & Beyond, Best Buy, Target, PetMed Express, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Hhgregg Inc and Kohl’s.  Of those names on the decline, Bed Bath & Beyond shares were down 2.4 percent on Wednesday, while Best Buy shares fell 3.6 percent, Target shares fell 0.4 percent, Dick’s Sporting Good shares declined 3.7 percent, Hhgregg shares dropped 2 percent and Kohl’s shares dipped 1.5 percent.  INTERNET EFs  For an investor interested in Amazon with a more diversified exposure, a good exchange-traded fund with exposure to a broad swath of Internet companies is the Dow Jones Internet Index. All stocks within the ETF generate at least 50 percent of their annual sales from the Internet.  Among top holders in the ETF are Google, with an 8.5 percent weight, Amazon, with an 8.1 percent weight, and eBay, with a 5.6 percent weight.  ETF investor Dave Fry favors FDN over others like the Merrill Lynch Internet Holders Fund because of FDN’s large diversification. HHH has over 40 percent of its weight in Amazon alone.  “You’re just as well to go buy Amazon,” Fry said, rather than hold onto HHH.  FDN is up 6.5 percent at $36.30 since the middle of June, just before earnings season. The ETF peaked at $38.25 in early July.  “We haven’t found another equal in terms of good structure,” said Fry, who sees a target of $38.50 as the next “breakout level” for the ETF.

30,TGT,Amazon revenue and spending surges,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc will use its surging revenue to boost growth and drive expansion into areas such as Web content and cloud computing rather than boost its margins.  The largest Internet retailer reported a jump in quarterly revenue on sales of its Kindle electronic reader and other electronics and forecast better-than-expected revenue for the current quarter, sending its shares up more than 6 percent late on Tuesday.  Amazon benefited from growth in e-commerce, though margins continued to be pressured by heavy spending on distribution, technology and digital content.  The company is investing to build warehouses and distribution to support rapidly growing e-commerce, its main business.  It’s also spending heavily on servers and data centers for its cloud computing business Amazon Web Services, while buying more digital content to bolster media offerings, such as streaming video.  This spending has dented profit margins in recent quarters. Analysts and investors are mostly happy to see such investment by the company — as long as it winds down at some point and lays the foundation for future profit increases.  “They’re sacrificing near-term profitability for longer-term revenue growth,” said Michael Souers, specialty retail analyst at S&P Equity Research. “As long as they are able to transform growth into profits in the future, investors will be satisfied. The chances are strong.”  Amazon on Tuesday reported a 51 percent rise in second-quarter revenue to $9.91 billion, surpassing Wall Street’s expectations for $9.4 billion.  The company forecast third-quarter sales of $10.3 billion to $11.1 billion, compared with the average forecast for $10.35 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Second-quarter net income fell to $191 million, or 41 cents per share, from $207 million, or 45 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier.

Operating income is expected to be between $20 million and $170 million in the third quarter, the company estimated. The guidance includes about $180 million of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets. It also assumes no other acquisitions or investments will close in the quarter.  That forecast suggests Amazon’s third-quarter pro-forma operating margin will be 1.8 percent to 3.2 percent, according to Aaron Kessler, an analyst at ThinkEquity. That’s below his previous estimate.  “Amazon’s willing to give up short-term profits for long-term growth and more market share,” Kessler told Reuters. “But ultimately they are managing the business for shareholders. We’re expecting modest margin expansion next year. Investors would like to see some return on these investments starting next year.”  The company is expected to introduce a tablet computer later this year that would compete with Apple Inc’s iPad.  Souers reckons thin third-quarter margins suggest Amazon is spending heavily on this new tablet.  “Longer term this is the best move they can make. The world is shifting toward digital from physical media and a tablet will help them cement a position in streaming content like movies and music,” the analyst said.  Amazon Chief Financial Officer Tom Szkutak declined to comment on whether the company was working on a new tablet computer. However, he pledged to keep spending and investing to support growth and new businesses.  Amazon said it spent $941 million on so-called “fulfillment centers” — warehouses or logistics centers — in the second quarter, compared to $582 million a year earlier. Technology and content costs totaled $698 million in the latest period, versus $408 million in the same period of 2010.  “We’re investing in the conversion from physical to digital and we feel very good about the traction we’re getting there,” he said.  Szkutak also stressed that the company is focused on cash flow and high returns on investment, rather than profit margins.  Amazon’s main online retail business is growing so fast that the company needs to spend on a lot of new distribution capacity, he explained during a conference call with analysts.  Amazon has announced 15 new fulfillment centers so far in 2011 and the company will unveil more before the end of this year, he noted.  Amazon Web Services — which hosts computing for corporate clients over the Internet — accounts for a “big piece” of Amazon’s current and future spending, because it’s growing so fast, the CFO added.  Amazon shares, which have risen about 18 percent since the start of 2011, gained 6.1 percent to $227.35 in after-hours trade.

32,TGT,"UPDATE 5-Amazon revenue, spending surges; stock jumps"," * Operating margin 2 pct vs year-earlier 4.1 pct   * Spending and margins still a concern   * Shares up 6.1 percent in after-hours trading  (Rewrites first paragraph, adds details on spending, profit margins)   By Alistair Barr   SAN FRANCISCO, July 26 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will use its surging revenue to boost growth and drive expansion into areas such as Web content and cloud computing rather than boost its margins.   The largest Internet retailer reported a jump in quarterly revenue on sales of its Kindle electronic reader and other electronics and forecast better-than-expected revenue for the current quarter, sending its shares up more than 6 percent late on Tuesday.   Amazon benefited from growth in e-commerce, though margins continued to be pressured by heavy spending on distribution, technology and digital content.   The company is investing to build warehouses and distribution to support rapidly growing e-commerce, its main business.   It’s also spending heavily on servers and data centers for its cloud computing business Amazon Web Services, while buying more digital content to bolster media offerings, such as streaming video.   This spending has dented profit margins in recent quarters. Analysts and investors are mostly happy to see such investment by the company — as long as it winds down at some point and lays the foundation for future profit increases.   “They’re sacrificing near-term profitability for longer-term revenue growth,” said Michael Souers, specialty retail analyst at S&P Equity Research. “As long as they are able to transform growth into profits in the future, investors will be satisfied. The chances are strong.”   Amazon on Tuesday reported a 51 percent rise in second-quarter revenue to $9.91 billion, surpassing Wall Street’s expectations for $9.4 billion.   The company forecast third-quarter sales of $10.3 billion to $11.1 billion, compared with the average forecast for $10.35 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Second-quarter net income fell to $191 million, or 41 cents per share, from $207 million, or 45 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts expected 35 cents per share for the latest second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   The operating profit margin fell to 2.0 percent from 4.1 percent a year earlier.   Operating income is expected to be between $20 million and $170 million in the third quarter, the company estimated. The guidance includes about $180 million of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets. It also assumes no other acquisitions or investments will close in the quarter.   That forecast suggests Amazon’s third-quarter pro-forma operating margin will be 1.8 percent to 3.2 percent, according to Aaron Kessler, an analyst at ThinkEquity. That’s below his previous estimate.   “Amazon’s willing to give up short-term profits for long-term growth and more market share,” Kessler told Reuters. “But ultimately they are managing the business for shareholders. We’re expecting modest margin expansion next year. Investors would like to see some return on these investments starting next year.”   The company is expected to introduce a tablet computer later this year that would compete with Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPad. [ID:nN1E76C1MO]   Souers reckons thin third-quarter margins suggest Amazon is spending heavily on this new tablet.   “Longer term this is the best move they can make. The world is shifting towards digital from physical media and a tablet will help them cement a position in streaming content like movies and music,” the analyst said.   Amazon Chief Financial Officer Tom Szkutak declined to comment on whether the company was working on a new tablet computer. However, he pledged to keep spending and investing to support growth and new businesses.   Amazon said it spent $941 million on so-called “fulfillment centers” — warehouses or logistics centers — in the second quarter, compared to $582 million a year earlier. Technology and content costs totaled $698 million in the latest period, versus $408 million in the same period of 2010.   “We’re investing in the conversion from physical to digital and we feel very good about the traction we’re getting there,” he said.   Szkutak also stressed that the company is focused on cash flow and high returns on investment, rather than profit margins.   Amazon’s main online retail business is growing so fast that the company needs to spend on a lot of new distribution capacity, he explained during a conference call with analysts.   Amazon has announced 15 new fulfillment centers so far in 2011 and the company will unveil more before the end of this year, he noted.   Amazon Web Services — which hosts computing for corporate clients over the Internet — accounts for a “big piece” of Amazon’s current and future spending, because it’s growing so fast, the CFO added.   Amazon shares, which have risen about 18 percent since the start of 2011, gained 6.1 percent to $227.35 in after-hours trade.   The company said sales in Worldwide Electronics and Other General Merchandise, which includes the Kindle e-reader, computers, cameras and other consumer electronics, jumped 69 percent to $5.89 billion in the second quarter.   Excluding currency fluctuations, sales rose 62 percent.   “That’s very strong,” said Scot Wingo, chief executive of ChannelAdvisor, a software provider that helps retailers sell more online through channels including Amazon and eBay Inc (EBAY.O).   “E-commerce in general is growing at 10 percent to 14 percent, so Amazon continues to gobble up market share.” Wingo owns Amazon shares, and eBay is an investor in ChannelAdvisor.   At some point, such growth will taper off and this is when Amazon will be able to cut back on spending and increase profitability, S&P’s Souers said. He’s expecting margins to increase “significantly” in coming years.  ",7272011,http://www.reuters.com/article/amazon/update-5-amazon-revenue-spending-surges-stock-jumps-idUSN1E76P1J620110727
33,TGT,Newell beats; outlook not as bad as feared,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Newell Rubbermaid Inc (NWL.N) beat Wall Street’s lowered quarterly profit and sales expectations as strength in Latin America and Asia Pacific offset weak demand in United States and Europe, sending its shares up almost 9 percent.  The results echoed those from other consumer products makers. Big gains in Latin America covered up U.S. declines at Colgate-Palmolive (CL.N) and Avon Products (AVP.N) as well.  Newell, the maker of Sharpie markers and Rubbermaid storage containers, had already lowered the bar for its new chief executive officer — former Unilever (ULVR.L) executive Michael Polk. In early June, it predicted a weak second quarter and slashed its 2011 forecast, prompting a 12 percent slide in its shares.  On Friday, investors overlooked the consumer product maker’s second profit warning in two months, pushing the stock up 8 percent to $15.51. The stock is still trading below where it was before the June 3 warning.  “The revised guidance is not a surprise in the current economic environment,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Connie Maneaty said, adding that the new CEO would likely want to have achievable targets.  The company now expects to earn $1.55 to $1.62 a share this year, excluding items, down from the lowered forecast of $1.60 to $1.67 given just eight weeks ago.  The latest forecast is “slightly above” the $1.50 to $1.55 or so that many analysts were anticipating, said JPMorgan analyst John Faucher.  The average Wall Street forecast is $1.58 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Polk, who joined Newell in mid-July, was not responsible for the second-quarter performance.  Now he is trying to set the company’s future tone, including some price increases that Newell asserts are necessary even as shoppers contend with economic woes.  “The consumer environment remains very tough,” Polk said. “The debt crisis in the U.S. and across many countries in Europe could further stress consumer confidence.”  Despite the uncertain sales climate, the company — which counts Target Corp (TGT.N), Staples Inc SPLS.O and Williams-Sonoma (WSM.N) as customers — raised its prices again in July as it pays more for oil, resin and other necessities.  As prices have gone up, the company is seeing some consumers buy less, as it expected, Polk said.  The company is well-positioned for the back-to-school season, Polk said. However the “key uncertainty is whether the consumer will show up and spend.”  Oppenheimer analyst Joe Altobello was more skeptical about Newell’s sales prospects for the rest of the year and concerned about rising commodity costs. He rated Newell’s shares at “perform” despite what he called a “reasonable” valuation.  Newell forecast core sales growth of 1 percent to 3 percent, down from its previous forecast of 3 percent to 4 percent. Core sales exclude foreign currency impact.  Net income rose to $146.7 million, or 49 cents a share, in the second quarter, from $130.4 million, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, the company earned 46 cents a share, beating the analysts’ average estimate of 42 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Net sales rose 5.1 percent to $1.57 billion, while analysts expected $1.55 billion.  ",7292011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-newell/newell-beats-outlook-not-as-bad-as-feared-idUSTRE76S4AQ20110729

The maker of Sharpie markers and Rubbermaid storage containers had already lowered the bar for its new chief executive officer by forecasting a weak second quarter and slashing its outlook for the year in June.

36,TGT,"Discounts, warm weather seen helping July sales","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Retailers are poised to report higher sales for July, a discount-driven month that may do little to lift their margins.  July sales figures will give investors an early read on demand in the consumer-driven U.S. economy at the start of the back-to-school season, the second-biggest selling period of the year after Christmas.  Retail chains ranging from Target Corp (TGT.N) to Saks Inc SKS.N will report closely watched sales at stores open at least year on Wednesday and Thursday. (For a related graphic, click r.reuters.com/ryz82s)  Analysts are expecting same-store sales to show a 4.1 percent rise for July, compared with a year-earlier increase of 2.8 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.  “The hot weather has certainly helped drive people into malls and helped clear out summer seasonal merchandise,” said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics Inc.  At issue, he added, is whether retailers will be able to sell their wares at full price in the back-to-school season.  It is not uncommon for retailers to offer discounts in July as they try to clear store shelves for back-to-school merchandise. Some investors worry that the discounting may have been deeper than usual and could weigh on margins.  “There was a lot of clearance merchandise,” said Trutina Financial Chief Investment Officer Patricia Edwards. “While the sales may be there, the margins may not.”  The back-to-school selling season has important implications as consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of the U.S. economy, which barely grew in the first half of 2011.  Retail stocks have fallen in the past month. The Standard & Poor's Retail Index .RLX is down 4.2 percent since retailers reported June sales, although the broad Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX fell more steeply at 5 percent.  NO STOMACH FOR FULL-PRICE GOODS  Analysts expect warehouse club operators such as Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc BJ.N to post some of the largest sales gains in July.  Warehouse clubs, which charge customers an annual fee to shop in their stores, have won shoppers seeking low prices on necessities such as groceries or toiletries.  Analysts also expect healthy sales gains at dollar stores and off-price retailers TJX Cos Inc (TJX.N) and Ross Stores Inc (ROST.O). Off-price chains sell sharply discounted designer merchandise often returned to vendors by department stores.  “I just don’t think that the consumer has the stomach right now to really pay full price, even for new ... back-to-school merchandise,” Perkins said. “Consumer confidence is not particularly strong right now.”  U.S. consumer sentiment fell in July to its lowest point in more than two years as anxieties over stagnant wages and unemployment deepened, a survey showed.  Rhonda Douma, who was shopping for her 3-year-old daughter at American Girl in a mall in Hollywood, California, said she planned to spend the same amount this back-to-school season as she did last year.  Her top destinations for the season highlight the price sensitivity of the post-recession American shopper.  “Usually it’s Walmart (WMT.N) and Target and Marshalls,” said Douma, 42. “We just found out about this store, and they have a lot of cute, fun stuff — and brand names for cheaper prices.  Analysts also expect a strong July for luxury chains such as Saks and Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) because of the purchasing power of higher-income shoppers.

39,TGT,Back-to-school shoppers want a D-E-A-L,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Less than two weeks into the back-to-school season, U.S. shoppers have a loud and clear message for retailers: “Make me an offer I can’t refuse.”  Saddled with longer-than-usual school supply lists and fewer discretionary dollars, budget-conscious parents are ruthlessly hunting for bargains.  “I was a little surprised about how long the list was. There were things I didn’t expect,” said Angie Brady, a resident of Decatur, Georgia, who has two young school-age children.  “I’m hoping to be able to find better deals. I’ll look for 2-for-1s and things on sale, but I’m also going to look for quality stuff at a good price,” Brady said.  Many parents are even becoming “brand-agnostic” in their search for bargains.  They are now willing to venture beyond traditional back-to-school destinations such as office supply stores and specialty apparel chains, and open to shopping at mass merchants, drugstores, dollar stores, online stores and pretty much anywhere else where they can find decent bargains.  For U.S. retailers, the back-to-school season is the second-biggest selling period of the year after the December holiday season. The season has important implications as consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of the U.S. economy, which barely grew in the first half of 2011.  The season typically runs from late July into early September as students gear up for the upcoming school year.  Susan Rau, 42, who was shopping for her twin sons at a mall in Hollywood, California, said she will buy more store brands and shop at department stores this season.  “They don’t really need that much and they’re growing so fast, I’m gonna wait till when they actually need it.”  Retailers are not waiting, though.  “Retailers are starting to advertise for back-to-school earlier and earlier. They are trying to make sure they are top-of-mind of consumers,” said Anthony Chukumba with BB&T Capital Markets. “We are going to see some real kind of blockbuster, traffic-driving deals just to try to pull the customers into the stores.”  Rhonda Douma, who was shopping for her 3-year-old daughter at American Girl in another mall in California, also plans to chase the bargains.  Her top destinations for the season highlight the price sensitivity of the post-recession American shopper.  “Usually it’s Wal-Mart and Target and Marshalls ,” said Douma. “We just found out about this store (Marshalls), and they have a lot of cute, fun stuff — and brand names for cheaper prices.”  Office supply stores are already feeling the pinch.  “While it is early in the back-to-school season, we have seen softer traffic trends versus the prior year,” OfficeMax Chief Executive Ravi Saligram said on Tuesday.  “We have targeted our assortments and promotions to an extremely value-conscious consumer in a highly promotional retail environment,” Saligram added.  Larger rival Staples Inc is touting everything from a $10 savings pass that lets shoppers save 15 percent on supplies throughout the season, to a ream of paper for 25 cents.  “The customer is very demanding right now,” said Demos Parneros, president of U.S. retail for Staples. “They want deals, special offers, special pricing. They don’t want to overpay.”  From Staples to Sharpie maker Newell Rubbermaid, companies are planning on little help from the economy in the crucial selling season.  “We would love upside. But we can’t count on it. So our plans don’t have any upside from the economy in them,” Parneros said. “So if things stay the way they are, how are we going to win more customers? How will we get more customers to come to the store? The answer is steady diet of deals.”  Data from Experian shows that back-to-school campaigns with an offer had 69 percent higher transaction rates than those that did not feature a deal.  Many school districts with strained budgets are requiring parents to supply more and more items that in the past would have been purchased by the schools, including basic items such as paper towels and hand sanitizers.  “That list just continues to get longer. (With the) sort of economy that we have been in for the past two-and-a-half to three years, that is becoming a way of life,” Kmart’s chief marketing officer, Mark Snyder, told Reuters.  The result is more pressure on parents already struggling to make household budgets work.  “Where we live, in our school district, you can ask the parents to do that. But there are districts where they just can’t afford that,” Rau told Reuters. Rau lives in Leesburg, Virginia, and was visiting California.  About 65 percent of parents surveyed by America’s Research Group said they did not plan to spend more this season.  “Necessity, not desire, will drive this year’s back-to-school season purchases,” said Janet Hoffman, managing director of Accenture’s Retail practice.

Steven Madden now expects third-quarter gross margins to fall 550-650 basis points due to the acquisitions of Topline and Cejon, which make store-branded products that typically sell at lower prices to name brands.	   “The shares are going down (because) the market is terrible today and some people are thinking about it as a gross margin story, which it is not. It’s a (product) mix issue,” Sterne, Agee & Leach analyst Sam Poser said.	   The company is unlikely to see gross margin improvement till the second half of 2012 because of the acquisitions and the way they are changing their product mix, Poser added.	   The broader U.S. market also fell on Tuesday on investors’ fears of a possible credit downgrade and concerns that economic growth could remain subdued as consumer spending in June declined for the first time in two years. 	   Excluding effects of a shift in product mix, the company said margins would have been flat to modestly up this year, as sales at its flagship Steve Madden brand remained strong. 	   The retailer, which also sells the Stevies and Candies brands, said it sees gross margins pressured by 200 basis points next year, due to a 5-8 percent increase in cost of goods in southern China.	   On a post-earnings call, Chief Executive Edward Rosenfeld said the company would mitigate these increases by moving production more north in China, where costs are lower, and by shifting some production to countries such as Mexico.	   He also expressed growing interest in emerging markets and said the company would open 5 stores in India by the year end. 	   “We are launching in India very soon. I think our first store opens in Mumbai within a couple of weeks,” Rosenfeld said.   For the second quarter, the company founded by designer Steve Madden in 1990 with $1,100 in his bank account, earned 55 cents a share, slightly above analysts’ estimates of 54 cents. 	   Shares of the Long Island City, New York-based company were trading down 5 percent at $37.65 on Tuesday afternoon on Nasdaq.

42,TGT,Target hopes exclusive designer deals boost sales," * Gwen Stefani launching kids’ clothing line at Target   * Kohl’s, Macy’s, others tout exclusive apparel brands   * Target apparel/home goods prices to rise later this year   By Jessica Wohl   CHICAGO, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) is hoping that Gwen Stefani can be the next Michael Graves.   Just as architect and designer Graves’s tea kettles and other home goods helped Target pioneer the concept of higher-end partnerships at mass chains, the retailer hopes hip children’s clothes from Stefani will bring in shoppers now that every retailer seems to feature exclusive merchandise.   “That really lifted their image in a huge way that lasts until today,” Peter Brown, vice chairman of retail consultancy Kurt Salmon, said of the 1999 debut of Michael Graves items.   Heading into the critical holiday season, Target will roll out Harajuku Mini kids’ clothing from singer and designer Stefani that will stay on its racks for more than a year.   Target will also stock women’s hats, jewelry and lingerie from high-end designers for shorter periods.   “It provides, I think, an opportunity to showcase to someone things they might not be able to afford otherwise,” said Trish Adams, senior vice president of apparel and accessories at Target. “With all of our sourcing power we’re able to do things at a price that most people can’t even think about doing.”   The four lines, which include hats from milliner Albertus Swanepoel and Josie Natori lingerie, are all priced under $50. The least expensive items, in the Harajuku Mini line debuting in November, will be $3.99. The priciest pieces, in the Dana Kellin jewelry collection due in October, are $49.99.   “When you’re competing on price, you need something that sticks out,” said Wall Street Strategies analyst Brian Sozzi, who said that Target seems to have lost some of its luster in exclusive apparel as other retailers signed their own deals.   The lines, when done right, also boost retailers’ profits.   “Generally they add a few points to the bottom line,” said Brown. “They are very important profit drivers in these businesses, in addition to being real ways to be different.”   These days, Target faces stepped up competition as other stores try to lure shoppers, mainly women, with items they cannot buy anywhere else.   At the same time, all retailers are struggling to hit the right balance of costs and price tags after spending more on cotton and other materials late in 2010 and early in 2011.   Target decided not raise all of its prices. It made changes such as moving some manufacturing to lower-cost countries, using different fabrics or blends, and even changing the types of button hole used to keep prices in check, said Adams.   Still, average prices in the third and fourth quarters “will be up double digits both in home and apparel at Target,” she said.   Apparel and accessories are critical to Target, accounting for 20 percent of its $65.8 billion in sales last year.   While that percentage is expected to dip as the company starts selling a wider variety of food at more of its stores, apparel carries much higher returns than the low-single digit profit margins retailers squeeze out by selling food.   At Target, exclusive brands such as C9 by Champion from Hanesbrands Inc (HBI.N), Just One Year by Carter’s Inc (CRI.N), Circo and Merona make up the bulk of apparel sales.   “Apparel has always been their kind of claim to fame,” said Sozzi. “So they have to get the exciting brands into stores and go out and market effectively, because I think the department stores are going to be out there marketing their brands quite effectively,” said Sozzi.   At Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N), private and exclusive lines such as Simply Vera Vera Wang accounted for 50 percent of first-quarter apparel sales. Its new goods include lines from Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony that are moving forward despite the celebrity singers’ very public breakup.   J.C. Penney Co Inc’s (JCP.N) proprietary items such as One Kiss jewelry from Cindy Crawford and I “heart” Ronson clothing from Charlotte Ronson make up nearly 50 percent of sales.   At Macy’s Inc (M.N), which on average has higher-income shoppers than the others, private brands are less crucial to overall results. Brands such as Charter Club represented about 20 percent of Macy’s sales in 2010.   Still, Macy’s is expanding lines such as Material Girl, the brainchild of Madonna and her daughter that includes clothing and accessories, and is adding beauty products, bedding and intimate apparel.   “This was once just kind of a margin enhancer for basic products,” said Kurt Salmon’s Brown. “Now, it’s the the foundation of the successful differentiation amongst most of the mass retailers.”  (Additional reporting by Phil Wahba in New York; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)   ",8022011,http://www.reuters.com/article/target-exclusives/target-hopes-exclusive-designer-deals-boost-sales-idUSN1E7700FA20110802

44,TGT,Discounts help chains in July; tough battle ahead,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Deep discounts brought shoppers to malls and helped many retail chains report sales gains in July, in an early sign that consumers will keep demanding bargains in the back-to-school season.  The 25 chains tracked by Thomson Reuters reported a 4.4 percent gain in sales at stores open at least a year. That just met analysts’ expectations for July, the month that kicks off the second-biggest selling season of the year after Christmas.  Most retail stocks fell. The Standard & Poor's Retail Index .RLX was down 2.0 percent at midday, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX fell more steeply at 2.3 percent.  The back-to-school selling season has important implications as consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of the U.S. economy. The July sales numbers did little to dispel concerns about the economy, which barely grew in the first half of 2011.  “Back-to-school (sales) will be an increase over last year, but it will be a hard-fought increase for retailers,” said Joel Bines, a managing director at advisory firm AlixPartners. “This year’s promotional activity may end up being heavier than last year.”  Consumers face not only a tough economy but also a myriad of choices.  “August is the month that price increases from higher cotton and petroleum prices will be felt,” Bines said. “Retailers won’t want to wait too long to see if consumers will balk at higher prices.”  Michael Niemira, chief economist of the International Council of Shopping Centers, also urged investors not to get too optimistic over the sales gains in July, which came in below his expectations of 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent, excluding higher gasoline prices.  “Overall, there’s a lot of worry where the industry and economy are heading,” Niemira said.  The ICSC is expecting same-store sales to rise 4 percent to 5 percent in August.  While sales held up “relatively well” for the quarter that ended in July, “the key question will be whether or not demand is starting to slow,” Goldman Sachs analyst Michelle Tan wrote in a research note.  “It’s a very Darwinistic environment in retail right now,” said Lawrence Creatura, portfolio manager at Federated Clover Investment Advisors in Rochester, New York.  Warehouse clubs Costco (COST.O) and BJ’s BJ.N and luxury chain Saks SKS.N posted some of the biggest sales gains in July, highlighting the bifurcation in the U.S. economy. Department store and other retailers that cater to the middle were among those that disappointed.  “The folks that are doing well economically are going to continue to spend at a pretty good clip, and the families that have less means are going to continue to pick and choose and only spend on what they need versus what they want,” said Alison Paul, leader of Deloitte’s U.S. retail practice.  The July figures made some chains, such as Target Corp (TGT.N), optimistic about demand heading into the second-biggest selling period of the year after Christmas.  “Back-to-school sales are off to a solid start, contributing to our confidence in the strategies we have in place and our ability to execute them,” Target Chief Executive Officer Gregg Steinhafel said on Thursday.  The discounter reported a better-than-expected 4.1 percent rise in same-store sales and forecast a low to mid-single-digit percentage increase for August.  “My mom is paying the bills, and they’re telling me that they need to cut back on me spending all this money on me buying clothes,” said Ed Rush, 15, who was shopping at a Target store in Chicago.  Costco Wholesale Corp reported a 10 percent rise in total July sales at stores open at least a year, beating the analysts’ average estimate of an 8.6 percent increase.  BJ’s Wholesale Club reported a 9.2 percent same-store sales rise, while analysts only expected 6.6 percent growth.  U.S. consumer sentiment fell in July to its lowest point in more than two years as anxieties over stagnant wages and unemployment deepened, a survey showed. [nN1E76S0T1]  That may have shown up in same-store sales from retailers like Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N) and Gap Inc (GPS.N), which disappointed investors by posting big declines.  The apparel sector reflected the mixed fortunes for retailers in July.  Teen-oriented chains Hot Topic HOTT.O and Wet Seal WTSLA.O blew past estimates, with Hot Topic forecasting a smaller quarterly loss than Wall Street was expecting.  But rival Zumiez Inc (ZUMZ.O) missed July sales expectations, blaming the weakness on lackluster sales of accessories.  Same-store sales reports capture only part of the retail economy.

51,TGT,UPDATE 3-Ingersoll to sell Hussmann stake for $370 mln," * To use proceeds to speed up $2 bln share repurchase   * To buy 28 million-32 million shares by the end of 2011   * Says Q3 continuing operations to include deal charge   * Keeps fiscal year EPS outlook, excluding charge  (Adds details on Hussmann sales, NEW YORK dateline)   NEW YORK, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Industrial conglomerate Ingersoll Rand PLC (IR.N) said it would sell a 60 percent stake in its Hussmann stationary refrigerated display case business to private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice for about $370 million.   The cooling systems maker said it would use the cash to speed up its $2 billion share repurchase program which began on June 8, and expects to buy 28 million to 32 million shares by the end of 2011.   Hussmann, founded in 1906 by Harry Hussmann, who pioneered food refrigeration systems, provides supermarkets and food retailers with display cases, refrigeration systems and beverage coolers.   It was sold to Ingersoll in 2000 for $1.55 billion in cash. The business recorded sales of about $800 million last year. Hussmann display cases are used by 17 of the largest 20 retailers in North America, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N).   Analysts have described Hussmann as underperforming and have praised the company for ditching assets bought for inflated prices by previous managers. Some call the Hussmann sale a positive catalyst for Ingersoll stock, which is down nearly 40 percent from its 52-week high in May.   The deal is expected to close near the end of the third quarter. Clayton Dubilier & Rice would pay Ingersoll a $30 million fee if the deal were canceled, according to a regulatory filing.   Ingersoll Rand said its third-quarter results from continuing operations will include a charge to reflect the terms of the Hussmann agreement. Excluding the charge, it stuck to its 2011 full-year earnings from continuing operations forecast of $2.90 to $3.10 a share.   It said it was watching for signs of changing market conditions amid a “growing level of uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment.”   The refrigeration display business is considered cyclical and exposed to rising raw material costs. Grocery stores and food retailers held back new investments during the economic downturn, squeezing margins for Hussmann and its rivals.   Ingersoll Rand sold its KOXKA European refrigerated display business in late 2010 to a unit of American Industrial Acquisition Corporation.

52,TGT,High-end retail shunned by investors favoring bargains,"CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goodbye jewelry and $100 yoga pants. Hello discount retailers.  As the U.S. stock market slides in and out of correction territory, consumers remain cautious and investors are acting as if it is 2008 again — unloading stocks of higher-end retailers including Tiffany & Co (TIF.N), Saks Inc SKS.N and Lululemon LLL.TO.  “I’ve really always been looking for a bargain, but on a high-end thing, it’s going to have to be a bigger bargain to be able to make the purchase,” Melanie Yoder, 40, a nurse from Chicago who works in the medical devices industry, said of how her behavior has changed since the 2008/2009 recession.  Yoder, who was leaving a Saks store on Michigan Avenue with a Saks shopping bag on Monday as the Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX was falling 6.6 percent, may be disappointed by the discounts this time around.  Retailers have grown more accustomed to keeping inventories lean and cutting costs, which could keep top-tier stores like Saks from having to result to the bargain-basement discounts of the last recession.  “There is absolutely a risk of having to discount, but it wouldn’t be as a dramatic as in 2008 when store chains were ordering a lot to fuel growth,” Paul Swinand, a retail analyst at Morningstar, said.  In the past several days, the market was betting that shoppers would pull back and return to discount stores.  In volatile markets since Friday, shares of Saks were down 7 percent; Lululemon fell 9.9 percent and Tiffany’s shares were 2.2 percent lower. On the other side of the spending spectrum, the stock of discounter Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) was up 1.44 percent and rival Target Corp (TGT.N) rose 2.6 percent, as investors expect discretionary spending to be curtailed, while falling gasoline and commodity prices help lower-income shoppers.  Some of the higher-end retail stocks went into last week “priced to perfection,” Wall Street Strategies analyst Brian Sozzi said. That left them vulnerable to any cutback by higher- end shoppers — and those that aspire to the higher end.  “If you are priced to perfection, everything has to be good,” Sozzi said. “When everything is good for Lululemon, people are buying two pairs of yoga pants and two T-shirts.”  The S&P 500 rebounded 4.7 percent on Tuesday. But the same day the Federal Reserve said U.S. economic growth was proving to be considerably weaker than expected, suggesting inflation, which has already moderated recently, will remain contained for the foreseeable future.  “I see myself doing a lot of saving at this point, until the economy actually gets back right, which is not going to be too soon,” Antoine Sykes, 37, a security officer at the Willis Tower in Chicago said. “I have a daughter going to college. A lot of my big spending, my big shopping is on hold until she has everything she needs.”  As growth slows, demand for oil and other commodities wanes, sending prices lower. For example, crude oil traded in New York is down 14 percent so far this month.  The drop in commodity prices could be welcomed news for lower- to middle-income consumers in a two-pronged economy where they have been steadfastly frugal, while the upper-income shopper spends.  “That’s presumably boosting discretionary power for the middle- to lower-income consumers,” Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said of the commodity price drops.  But consistently high unemployment, a weak economy and a volatile stock market continues to affect consumer spending, cutting into big-ticket purchases.  “It’s something that makes you think twice before making any big purchases, like for a mortgage for a house or even for automobiles,” Wilson Aguilar, 38, a business analyst for J.P. Morgan in Chicago said.  Smaller expenditures have been hit as well. U.S. cable and satellite TV providers lost more subscribers than ever in the second quarter.  Still, analysts believe that even if the economy were to fall into another recession, the shock to the consumer would not be as bad as it was in 2008, when some people felt the need to be more discreet about openly displaying signs of wealth.  “I don’t think people are going to be worried about going out to a restaurant with a Gucci bag.”  ",8102011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-stocks/high-end-retail-shunned-by-investors-favoring-bargains-idUSTRE7794JP20110810

54,TGT,UPDATE 5-Canadian Tire profit falls on higher spending," * Q2 2011 EPS C$1.29 vs C$1.50 in Q2 2010   * Profit missed C$1.45 estimate, according to I/B/E/S   * Revenue up 4 pct to C$2.57 bln   * Spending on promotions, infrastructure holds back profit (Adds further detail on costs from earnings call)   By Allison Martell and S. John Tilak   TORONTO, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Canadian Tire Corp (CTC.TO) (CTCa.TO), one of the country’s biggest retailers, said on Thursday quarterly profit fell 14 percent as it spent more on promotions and invested in infrastructure.   Profit at the company, whose flagship Canadian Tire chain sells housewares, sporting goods and automotive products, dropped even as higher gasoline prices helped boost retail sales by 5.1 percent.   Earnings fell to C$105.8 million, or C$1.29 a share, in the fiscal second quarter ended July 2, from C$122.8 million, or C$1.50, a year earlier.   Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of C$1.45 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Revenue, which includes financial services, rose 4 percent to C$2.57 billion, compared with the average analyst estimate of C$2.62 billion.   Lower-than-expected sales of some seasonal goods and costs related to the company’s Forzani Group acquisition held back profit, said Chief Executive Officer Stephen Wetmore in a release.   A new loyalty program raised operating expenses, and the company will spend more on the pilot, Chief Financial Officer Marco Marrone said on a conference call Thursday afternoon.   But growth in marketing and advertising expenses will taper off in the second half, he said.   The company also invested an undisclosed amount on the September launch of online tire sales.   “We want to bring online tire sales to the mass market,” said Glenn Butt, executive vice president of automotive, in an email.    Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said that higher costs will likely taper off in the coming quarters, as short-term investments wrap up. But competition and consumer confidence are more of a challenge.   “It’s a tough operating environment,” he said.   Canadian Tire’s stock took a hit in January when Target Corp (TGT.N) said it would enter Canada. Shares are still well below their January high.   The full impact of Target’s entry will not be clear for some time, but Yarbrough said that Canadian Tire only has a 15 percent product overlap with Target.   Canadian Tire’s planned C$771 million purchase of Forzani Group Ltd FGL.TO, the country’s top sports retailer, cleared a review by the Competition Bureau in early August. The company said it expects that transaction to close in the current quarter.   The Toronto-based company also owns PartSource autoparts outlets and Mark’s Work Wearhouse, a chain of casual and work clothing stores that it acquired about a decade ago.   Since the acquisition, revenue and margins have improved substantially at Mark’s, and analysts have pointed to that as an indication of what the retailer could achieve with Forzani.   Canadian Tire’s more heavily traded Class A shares rose 0.7 percent to C$55.92 Thursday afternoon on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

Claiborne also struck a deal with Li & Fung Ltd (0494.HK) to have the Hong Kong-based clothing exporter handle U.S. distribution for Claiborne’s retail chains, which include Juicy Couture, Mexx and Lucky Brand. That will “significantly” reduce its fixed costs, the company said in a statement.   Li & Fung manages the supply chains for retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N).   Elizabeth Arden will pay Claiborne $58.4 million in cash that it will use to pay down debt. But Arden will offer a lower royalty rate for the brands that will stay under license to Claiborne, include Juicy Couture and Lucky Brand fragrances.   Claiborne last month reported a quarterly loss. It has not reported an annual profit since 2006.

57,TGT,"Li & Fung H1 profit falls on rising costs and weak U.S., Europe","By Donny Kwok and Rachel Lee HONG KONG (Reuters) - Li & Fung Ltd (0494.HK), the manager of supply chains for retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N), posted a 15 percent decline in its first-half net profit, as rising operating costs and flagging U.S. and European demand ate into margins.  It is the first time in at least 14 years the Hong Kong-based consumer goods exporter has registered a year-on-year decline in interim earnings and analysts say the firm faces bigger challenges in the second half.  Weak economies in the United States and Europe, where the firm is heavily exposed, are adding to its margin pressures. Core operating profit margin fell to 3.2 percent from 5.09 percent a year ago.  Li & Fung CEO Bruce Rockowitz told reporters that economic growth in the U.S. and Europe was slower than expected, but he did not believe there would be a recession.  “We don’t think it’s going into double dip,” he said, adding that he expected the company’s margins to improve in the second half.  But analysts were not convinced.  “We are very much concerned about the outlook of its businesses in the U.S. and Europe,” said William Lo, analyst at Ample Capital. “Apart from cost cutting, I can’t see much the company can do for the time being.”  Li & Fung, which supplies consumer goods such as garments and toys, said about 58 percent of its revenue came from the U.S. market in the first six months, while Europe’s contribution was 22 percent.  Li & Fung posted a net profit of $236 million for January-June, compared with $278 million in the same period of 2010.  The profit is roughly in line with an average forecast of HK$1.77 billion ($227 million), according to seven analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, who expected Li & Fung’s first-half profit to be hurt by higher costs of sourcing, staff, raw material, and an increase in operating expenses related to its acquisitions.  Li & Fung sources more than half of its goods from China — whose currency has risen sharply against the U.S. dollar in the past few years and where labor and raw material costs have also surged.  Excluding one-off gains of $46.5 million from disposal of businesses and exceptional gain of $13.7 million from sales of properties, the firm’s interim profits were disappointing as U.S. and European demand sputtered.  “We have started to see the negative impact on its earnings. Second half will be even worse,” Conita Hung, head of equity research at Delta Asia Financial. “They may need to slow down their M&A activities in the current economic climate.”  Li & Fung said on Thursday it would buy the distribution networks Fishman & Tobin and Crimson Rose. It did not elaborate.  In June, Li & Fung said it acquired five sourcing and trading companies in the United States, Europe and Thailand to beef up its trading and distribution networks.  In May, it said it would focus on internal growth over the next three years, but would look for acquisition opportunities in Japan.  Li & Fung, which missed its 2008-2010 profit target, has set an ambitious growth plan for 2011-2013, aiming for a core operating profit of $1.5 billion by 2013. This compares with $725 million in core operating profit it booked last year against a target of $1 billion.  Some analysts worry about the sustainability of the company’s business model as customers increasingly bypass intermediaries and go for direct sourcing to cut costs.  Li & Fung has been taking some steps to reduce costs and bolster growth.  Last month, it said it would lay off 40 staff in Hong Kong to meet the changing needs of its European business.  The exporter said in June that it planned to expand its sourcing business in fast-growing emerging markets, such as China, South America and Eastern Europe.  It was also banking on higher-margin businesses such as beauty products for growth, and aimed for a larger presence in markets such as Turkey, India and China.  Shares of Li & Fung ended unchanged on Thursday prior to the results, outperforming a 0.95 percent fall by the benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI.

60,TGT,"Wal-Mart U.S. sales start to perk up, as do shares","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc said same-store sales at its U.S. discount chain rose in July, as a renewed emphasis on offering low prices on a wide assortment of goods started to stem more than two years of quarterly sales declines.  Wal-Mart’s comments and better than expected quarterly results that it also reported on Tuesday sent its shares over 4 percent higher. The world’s largest retailer, with nearly 9,700 stores, stressed its commitment to pricing products below its competitors and emphasizing that promise to shoppers.  Walmart discount stores account for nearly 11 percent of U.S. retail sales. More of its shoppers are relying on government aid to help them pay for food and other necessities, are shopping less often to save money on gasoline and are spending less when paychecks run out, showing that the low- and middle-class Americans to which chains such as Walmart cater clearly remain under pressure.  Recent analyst reports have suggested that competitors have closed the price gap with Walmart in areas such as food.  “The vast majority of people who shop at Walmart no longer believe that Walmart is the lowest-priced on most things,” said Wendy Liebmann, CEO of WSL/Strategic Retail, citing her firm’s April survey of Walmart shoppers.  While Walmart U.S. same-store sales fell 0.9 percent in the quarter that ran from May through July, that measure rose in July and the company still expects it to rise on a quarterly basis at some point this year, Walmart U.S. Chief Executive Officer Bill Simon said.  “It seems like they’re going to kind of ramp up that pressure on lowering price,” said ITG Investment Research analyst John Tomlinson.  Wal-Mart posted larger-than-anticipated increases in quarterly profit and sales, helped by its Sam’s Club warehouse and international chains such as Britain’s Asda.  Still, the United States remains its biggest market, accounting for 62.1 percent of the $419 billion in sales last year, and many of Walmart’s U.S. customers are struggling.  “They’re trading down to stretch their budgets — buying a lower-priced brand of detergent, moving from branded canned goods to private label and purchasing half gallons of milk instead of gallons,” Wal-Mart Chief Executive Mike Duke said during a recorded call.  U.S. shoppers’ biggest economic concerns are job security, the rising cost of food and the high price of gasoline, Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley told reporters.  The number of shoppers relying on government aid has risen over the last 2-1/2 years, Holley said, noting that unemployment levels have been higher for people who had less education and less income to begin with.  Sales at Wal-Mart's U.S. discount stores open at least a year, excluding fuel, have now fallen for nine straight quarters. (Graphic on U.S. Walmart same-store sales: r.reuters.com/bad33s)  The second quarter’s decline was near the low end of Wal-Mart’s forecast of down 1 percent to up 1 percent. Analysts on average had expected a decline of 0.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Even though Walmart’s U.S. same-store sales were worse than those of competitors such as Target Corp, dollar stores and warehouse chains, Walmart gained momentum, said Wall Street Strategies analyst Brian Sozzi, who upgraded the shares to “hold” from “sell.”  Wal-Mart said U.S. same-store sales improved each month during the quarter. Fewer customers visited the stores, but those who shopped spent more on average.  Wal-Mart appears to be taking the right steps, including pricing changes, growing its international business and opening more smaller stores. But the stock may be too pricey for some as it is hard to see substantial changes in such a large company, said Larry Carroll, president of Carroll Financial, based in Charlotte, North Carolina.  “I’m neutral on it, and if it were 10 or 15 percent cheaper, I’d be inclined to buy it,” said Carroll, who has owned Wal-Mart in the past.  Shares were up $2.41 at $52.39 in afternoon trading. Shares of Home Depot Inc, which also reported better-than-expected quarterly results, climbed as well.  Wal-Mart earned $1.09 per share from continuing operations in the second quarter ended July 31, up from 97 cents a year earlier and near the high end of its forecast. Excluding items, earnings were $1.12, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.08, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 5.5 percent to $108.64 billion.  The company raised its fiscal year profit forecast and said Walmart U.S. same-store sales should be down 1 percent to up 1 percent in the current third quarter.

(Graphic on U.S. Walmart same-store sales: r.reuters.com/bad33s)   The second quarter’s decline was near the low end of Wal-Mart’s forecast of down 1 percent to up 1 percent. Analysts on average had expected a decline of 0.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.   Even though Walmart’s U.S. same-store sales were worse than those of competitors such as Target Corp (TGT.N), dollar stores and warehouse chains, Walmart gained momentum, said Wall Street Strategies analyst Brian Sozzi, who upgraded the shares to “hold” from “sell.”   Wal-Mart said U.S. same-store sales improved each month during the quarter. Fewer customers visited the stores, but those who shopped spent more on average.   Wal-Mart appears to be taking the right steps, including pricing changes, growing its international business and opening more smaller stores. But the stock may be too pricey for some as it is hard to see substantial changes in such a large company, said Larry Carroll, president of Carroll Financial, based in Charlotte, North Carolina.   “I’m neutral on it, and if it were 10 or 15 percent cheaper, I’d be inclined to buy it,” said Carroll, who has owned Wal-Mart in the past.   Shares were up $2.41 at $52.39 in afternoon trading. Shares of Home Depot Inc (HD.N), which also reported better-than-expected quarterly results, climbed as well. [ID:nN1E77F08O]   Wal-Mart earned $1.09 per share from continuing operations in the second quarter ended July 31, up from 97 cents a year earlier and near the high end of its forecast. Excluding items, earnings were $1.12, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.08, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 5.5 percent to $108.64 billion.   The company raised its fiscal year profit forecast and said Walmart U.S. same-store sales should be down 1 percent to up 1 percent in the current third quarter.

62,TGT,Wal-Mart to show if U.S. stores are back to growth," * Wal-Mart to report Q2 earnings on Tuesday morning   * Company EPS forecast $1.05-$1.10, analysts’ view $1.08   * U.S. same-store sales view down 1 pct to up 1 pct   * Analysts’ U.S. same-store sales view down 0.6 pct    By Jessica Wohl	   CHICAGO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Turning around a prolonged U.S. sales slump is key to Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s success, and Tuesday’s results will show if the retailer’s strategies to mend its biggest business have really started to pay off.	   Wal-Mart is making every effort to offer the best prices on a wider variety of goods in order to win over shoppers who have gone to other chains, such as dollar stores, and who continue to cut back on spending as high unemployment and other economic troubles persist.	   The world’s largest retailer has suffered two consecutive years of declines in sales at U.S. Wal-mart stores open at least a year. It predicted that U.S. same-store sales would return to positive territory this year, maybe as soon as the second quarter, though most industry-watchers predict the return to growth at its biggest unit will take a bit longer.	   In May, Wal-Mart forecast same-store sales at the Wal-mart chain in the United States, excluding fuel, would be down 1 percent to up 1 percent. Analysts, on average, expect to see a 0.6 percent decline, according to Thomson Reuters data.	   “They are having to get more competitive on pricing just as inflation is hitting,” Wall Street Strategies analyst Brian Sozzi said of Wal-Mart.	   As Wal-Mart works to offer the lowest prices, manufacturers from Kellogg Co to Procter & Gamble Co are trying to raise prices as they pay more for essentials such as grains and oil-based materials, highlighting the pressures facing major companies, not to mention the low-income shoppers trying to buy their goods.	   Raymond James analyst Budd Bugatch checked prices on a variety of groceries on Aug. 11, and found that Wal-mart’s price advantage on branded goods narrowed versus Target Corp  and Publix after two months of expansion. Wal-mart was still the price leader, but to a lesser extent than in July.	   At the same time, the price of a basket of goods sold under Wal-mart’s Great Value private brand fell for just the second time in the 14 months Bugatch has tracked such data, he said.	   Wal-mart’s everyday low-price strategy now includes stepped-up advertising behind its guarantee to match competitors’ prices. The company is also busy bringing thousands of items such as fishing lures and fabric back to thousands of stores to satisfy shoppers.	   Wal-mart U.S. is Wal-Mart’s biggest unit by far, accounting for $260.3 billion, or 62.1 percent, of sales in fiscal 2011, so growth in the business is crucial.	   For now, strong results from its smaller international units and Sam’s Club warehouse club unit should continue to help mitigate the impact of the U.S. slump.

The Dow and S&P indices ended little changed in an up-and-down session where investors sold growth sectors in favor of defensive shares like telecoms and utilities.  Computer maker Dell DELL.O was the S&P’s worst performer, losing 10 percent to $14.20 after cautious comments on spending on technology by the government sector.  Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) was also hit, falling 3.7 percent to $31.39 and weighing on the Dow as investors also worried business spending could decline in coming quarters.  “You don’t usually see tech down so sharply while the rest of the market is down less, which shows that the latest earnings have created a lot of concerns,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at the ConvergEx Group in New York.  In after-hours action by tech companies, NetApp Inc (NTAP.O) slumped 14.5 percent to $35.60 after its revenue missed expectations while JDS Uniphase JDSU.O lost 3.2 percent to $11.32 following a weak first-quarter outlook.  Retailers slipped following a weak report from Abercrombie & Fitch, despite good news from Target. With 94 percent of S&P companies reporting earnings, 72 percent have beaten expectations.

The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was down 11.97 points, or 0.47 percent, at 2,511.48.  Concerns that the U.S. economy may be headed for another recession and that Europe may be unable to stem its financial troubles have hit the market, with a strong earnings season one of the few bright spots for traders, though they often have not been enough to offset macroeconomic woes.  “So with technology concerns, and then more than our fair share of recession concerns and continued concerns about Europe, we’re in a real ‘three strikes, you’re out’ situation today with no reason to buy,” Colas said.  Both Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF.N) and Deere & Co (DE.N) slumped on disappointing margins news. Abercrombie also raised concerns about the consumer response to higher prices going into the crucial back-to-school shopping season.  Abercrombie dropped 8.7 percent to $64.87 while Deere lost 1.2 percent to $74.26 and was one of the biggest drags on industrial shares. The S&P retail index .RLX fell 0.6 percent.

Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the Nasdaq by about seven to six. On the New York Stock Exchange, three stocks rose for every two that fell.  The day’s moves were reminiscent of the sharp downward swings last week after Standard & Poor’s downgrade of the United States’ top-tier credit rating on August 5. The top two S&P sectors were telecom .GSPL, up 1.6 percent, and utilities .GSPU, up 0.8 percent. Both groups are considered defensive strategies.

69,TGT,"Target profit, forecast surpass Street, shares up","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) reported a bigger-than-expected rise in quarterly profit and forecast a more profitable year than analysts were anticipating on Wednesday, as its credit card business continued to grow and sales perked up as the summer progressed.  Shares of Target, which has more than 1,760 U.S. stores and is getting ready to open stores in Canada, soared 5.8 percent to $52.25 in premarket trading.  Target has been adding groceries to more of its stores, a move that boosts sales but also pressures profitability, as food carries lower margins than merchandise such as apparel.  Still, the second-quarter gross margin decline was not too steep. Gross margin declined to 31.6 percent from 32 percent.  “The big win was the gross margin coming in better than expected,” said Rob Plaza, senior equity analyst at Key Private Bank, who had anticipated gross margin would fall to around 31.2 percent to 31.3 percent.  A large part of Target’s profit coming in ahead of expectations also came from the credit card business, he said.  Target said in January that it wants to sell its credit card receivables, or the debts that cardholders owe the retailer.  But it wants to keep control of the credit card operations, which are part of a key marketing strategy in which it offers a 5 percent discount to cardholders who pay with their Target branded cards.  Average receivables declined 12.4 percent to $6.2 billion, bad debt expense plunged to $15 million from $138 million and profit rose to $171 million from $149 million.  Target earned $704 million, or $1.03 per share, in the second quarter, up from $679 million, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier.  Analysts, on average, expected it to earn 97 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Target was not the only retailer reporting better-than-expected results. Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), the world’s largest retailer and Target’s main superstore competitor, said its profit rose more than expected. [ID:nN1E77F03P] On Wednesday, retailers such as BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc BJ.N and Staples Inc SPLS.O also surpassed expectations.  Target forecast third-quarter earnings per share of 70 cents to 75 cents, and full-year earnings per share of $4.15 to  Analysts were looking for Target to earn 71 cents per share this quarter and $4.12 per share this year.  Earlier this month, Target said second-quarter sales rose 5.1 percent to $15.9 billion, with sales at stores open at least a year up 3.9 percent.

Stocks saw sharp downward swings last week after Standard & Poor’s downgrade of the United States’ top-tier credit rating on Aug. 5. The benchmark S&P 500 index is down 12.8 percent from its April 29 high.   Concerns that the U.S. economy may be headed for another recession and that Europe may be unable to stem its financial troubles have hit the market, Saut said, but he said he doubts another U.S. recession is likely at this point.

71,TGT,"UPDATE 5-Target, other retailers beat estimates"," * Q2 EPS $1.03 tops Wall St view $0.97   * Sees FY shr $4.15-$4.30, St view was $4.12   * Shares up 2.1 percent  (Adds comments from Target, analyst; updates stock activity)   By Jessica Wohl   CHICAGO, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) reported a bigger-than-expected rise in quarterly profit and forecast a more profitable year than analysts were anticipating, as its credit card business continued to grow and sales heated up with the summer weather.   Shares of Target, which has more than 1,760 U.S. stores and is getting ready to open stores in Canada, were up 2.1 percent to $50.41 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading after rising as much as 5.8 percent earlier on Wednesday.   Retail results are highlighting a split between middle- and upper-income shoppers, who may be waiting a bit before they buy, versus the unemployed and low-income workers struggling to make ends meet. [ID:nN1E77F08O]   “While optimism at all income levels has improved since the recession, wealthy households continue to be the most optimistic,” Kathryn Tesija, Target’s executive vice president of merchandising, said during a conference call.   “The 20 percent of households with the highest incomes are shopping more often and spending more, while the other 80 percent have been cutting trips and spending less,” she said of retailers’ experience in general.   Target’s shoppers are buying closer to when they need things, so the company said it is a a bit too early to fully judge August sales that include back-to-school purchases from school uniforms to dorm-sized refrigerators.   So far, August sales are within Target’s forecast of a mid single-digit increase, though slightly below the increases seen in June and July, Chief Financial Officer Douglas Scovanner said.   Target’s same-store sales rose 4.5 percent in June, 4.1 percent in July and 3.9 percent in the second quarter.   Target was not the only retailer reporting better-than-expected results. Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), the world’s largest retailer and Target’s main competitor, said Tuesday that its profit rose more than expected. [ID:nN1E77F03P]   On Wednesday, retailers such as BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc BJ.N and office supplies leader Staples Inc SPLS.O also reported results that surpassed expectations. [ID:nN1E77F16Q] [ID:nN1E77G01P]   Staples Chief Executive Officer Ron Sargent said he did not see a double dip in the U.S. economy, though the country is “probably more likely to stay in economic purgatory for a while longer.”   Abercrombie & Fitch Co’s (ANF.N) quarter was also better than anticipated, but it warned of troubles as it enters “a period of greater uncertainty,” and its shares tumbled. [ID:nL3E7JH1NE]   Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold urged investors to be more picky while investing in the retail space, identifying companies “with sustainable long-term competitive advantages.”   His top retail picks include Target, Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N), Staples, Nike Inc (NKE.N) and VF Corp (VFC.N).   Target’s move to add groceries to more stores has boosted sales but also pressured profitability, as food carries lower margins than merchandise like apparel. Still, the second-quarter gross margin decline was not too steep. Gross margin dipped to 31.6 percent from 32 percent.   “The big win was the gross margin coming in better than expected,” said Rob Plaza, senior equity analyst at Key Private Bank, who had anticipated gross margin would fall to around 31.2 percent to 31.3 percent.   A 0.5 percent rise in same-store transactions was a surprise given Target’s efforts to bring people in more often, such as the grocery expansion and a credit card discount program, said Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser.   A large part of Target’s profit coming in ahead of expectations also came from the credit card business.   Target’s “super-charged” profitability from credit card receivables is likely to moderate when the write-off rate settles into a more normal pattern, Scovanner said.   Target said in January that it wants to sell its credit card receivables, or the debts that cardholders owe the retailer, and talks with potential buyers are progressing.   But it wants to keep control of the credit card operations — a key part of its marketing, as it offers a 5 percent discount to cardholders who pay with Target REDcards. [ID:nN13293279]   Average receivables declined 12.4 percent to $6.2 billion, bad debt expense plunged to $15 million from $138 million and profit rose to $171 million from $149 million.   Target earned $704 million, or $1.03 per share, in the second quarter ended July 30, up from $679 million, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had expected it to earn 97 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Sales rose 5.1 percent to $15.9 billion.   Target forecast third-quarter earnings per share of 70 cents to 75 cents, and full-year earnings per share of $4.15 to $4.30. Analysts have been looking for Target to earn 71 cents per share this quarter and $4.12 per share this year.   The company said it would give details on its longer-term plans during a Thursday meeting with investors in New York.

Energy shares gave an extra boost to Wall Street as crude futures jumped more than 2 percent after a drop in gasoline stockpiles and as the euro rose versus the U.S. dollar. The S&P energy sector .GSPE rose 1.6 percent.   Earnings beats and strong forecasts from retailers Target and Staples shifted the focus to the U.S. economy and away from Europe’s debt crisis, which has driven U.S. trading of late.   Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity in the United States.   “Consumers may not be very confident, but they’re still spending money,” said Al Kugel, chief investment strategist at Atlantic Trust. “For Target to make that comment is a confirmation of that,” he said, referring to its bullish profit outlook.   The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI added 96.04 points, or 0.84 percent, to 11,501.97. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX gained 13.44 points, or 1.13 percent, to 1,206.20. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC rose 23.32 points, or 0.92 percent, to 2,546.77.   The S&P 500 is up nearly 10 percent from a nearly 1-year low hit last week as sovereign debt and economic growth worries pressured equities.   European shares .FTEU3 bounced back from earlier losses to gain 0.7 percent, even as financial shares .SX7P fell as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy made clear joint euro zone bond issuance was not on their agenda.

73,TGT,"UPDATE 1-Target optimistic on REDcard holders, Canada"," * Sees sales of $100 bln or more, EPS of $8 in six years   * REDcard holders to make up larger chunk of overall sales   By Jessica Wohl   CHICAGO, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Target Corp’s (TGT.N) customers like its REDcard credit and debit cards, with the top 25 percent of shoppers who used the cards spending $3,000 a year or more, it said on Thursday.   Target, which has had its own credit cards for years, last year introduced a nationwide 5 percent discount for shoppers using its cards as it works on increasing shopper loyalty and getting them to buy more when they visit.   More than 9 percent of sales now come from REDcard holders, and that should rise to more than 12 percent next year, Chief Financial Officer Douglas Scovanner said during a New York meeting with Wall Street analysts that was also webcast.   The Minneapolis-based discount retailer, known for selling a mix of household basics and chic apparel and accessories, has no plans to enter another country besides opening shops in Canada, said Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel. More than 30,000 Canadians already have REDcards even though Target has yet to open any stores there, the company said.   The company expects annual sales of $100 billion or more and earnings of at least $8 per share in six years, once initiatives such as opening its first Canadian stores in 2013, selling fresh food at additional U.S. stores and testing new smaller City Target stores in major markets such as Chicago next year take hold. Last year, Target had $65.79 billion in sales and earnings of $4 per share.   On Wednesday, Target reported a bigger-than-expected rise in quarterly profit and forecast a more profitable year than analysts were anticipating.

The news pushed down shares of the parent of the Sears department stores and Kmart discount chain by almost 7 percent to its lowest level in two years.  Sales at Sears Holdings have fallen every year since 2005, when billionaire investor Eddie Lampert formed the company by merging the two chains.  “Essentially, the message from consumers to Sears is “we will shop there, but not at the prices you wish to charge as we won’t pay full price for substandard service and unwelcoming physical facilities,” Credit Suisse’s Gary Balter said.  Sears shares fell 6.5 percent to $56.25  The retailer, home to brands such as Craftsman tools and Kenmore appliances, is a victim of the weak economy and stiff competition as well as its own problems.  Analysts have criticized Sears for relying too heavily on cost-cutting to boost profit, rather than upgrading its stores and improving its customer service.  It faces tough competition from retailers including Home Depot Inc (HD.N), Lowes Cos Inc (LOW.N), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Target Corp (TGT.N) and Best Buy Co (BBY.N). It has been losing market share in appliances and apparel. For a related graphic, click r.reuters.com/fap33s Sears has made some decent investments in its internet offerings, but has fallen well behind the value offering at other rivals, Balter said.  The retailer has also been revamping its management team. It recently named former Hewitt Associates Chief Financial Officer Robert Schriesheim as its CFO and former FreshDirect executive Monica Woo as its new chief marketing officer. Former Avaya Inc AVXX.UL CEO Lou D’Ambrosio joined Sears as its CEO in February, ending the company’s three-year search for a new chief executive.  Sears Holdings has had trouble hiring executives since Lampert is seen as being difficult to work with and does not want to pay too much, Morningstar analyst Paul Swinand told Reuters in early August.  Higher costs also hurt Sears Holdings, which said it would lay off about 250 employees in support and field roles.  The news on Thursday came two months after the retailer laid off 700 employees who worked in the appliance section of its Kmart stores.  It is also closing 29 stores and seven product repair center locations, while converting 14 Sears Grand stores to Kmarts. The company said there could be more job cuts from those actions.  In the second quarter, sales fell 1.2 percent to $10.3 billion, while analysts expected $10.5 billion. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year fell 0.7 percent, with those at the namesake stores down 1.2 percent and Kmart staying flat.  The company blamed the lackluster sales numbers on weak demand for consumer electronics at both Sears and Kmart.  It took bigger discounts to boost sales of appliances, apparel and home goods. Sears is now trying to boost traffic by rolling out exclusive apparel brands with TV celebrities such as the Kardashians and Sophia Vergara.  The net loss at Sears Holdings widened to $146 million, or $1.37 a share, from $39 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the loss was $1.13 a share.

76,TGT,Toys R Us puts baby gear near toys in more stores," NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Toys “R” Us [TOY.UL] is opening 21 new stores this year that will sell toys side-by-side with products such as baby food and laundry supplies, the world’s largest toy retailer said on Tuesday.   The company, which is looking to go public, said the new stores will include 11 “R” superstores and 10 side-by-side locations. The retailer is also renovating 23 existing locations to the side-by-side format.   The news comes just months before the key holiday season, when toy retailers make more than a third of their income.   In recent years, Toys R Us has been placing necessities such as baby food beside toys in its stores to woo customers who prefer one-stop shopping.   The New Jersey-based retailer, which operates stores under its namesake brand and the Babies R Us and FAO Schwarz labels, filed for an IPO of up to $800 million in May. In early July, two sources told Reuters the retailer was not expected to go public until 2012.

77,TGT,"Home Depot, Walmart, grocers get boost from Irene","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene sent East Coast shoppers into stores to stock up on essentials this week, instead of the clothes, notebooks and other supplies that retailers were counting on selling as children get ready to go back to school.  Chains such as Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) were doing brisk business on Friday, selling water, flashlights, batteries and other goods in states standing in Irene’s potential track from the Carolinas to Massachusetts.  “Most probably, the biggest demand right now is for generators, obviously,” said Suzanne Roche, manager of a Sears (SHLD.O) store in Wilmington, North Carolina. “We have got customers calling nonstop.”  Irene is due to make its first U.S. landfall in North Carolina on Saturday. The storm, which battered Atlantic and Caribbean islands including the Bahamas and the Dominican Republic, is then expected to head to the densely populated Northeast.  Those who were not trying to squeeze in one last summer stay on the New Jersey shore or Long Island beaches may have been planning to go to shopping malls to buy clothes, shoes and other items for children who will soon head back to school. Now those plans will be on hold.  “Nobody is going to go to a mall to buy a pair of jeans,” said Richard Hastings, consumer strategist at Global Hunter Securities.  The back-to-school shopping season is the second-largest spending time for U.S. shoppers, behind the winter holidays.  The storm may dent the upcoming index of August sales at stores open at least a year by 1.5 percentage points, Hastings said.  About two dozen retailers, including department stores and apparel chains, are due to report monthly same-store sales on September 1. Analysts were expecting a 4.8 percent rise for August, Thomson Reuters said on Friday.  The storm could hurt retailers like Saks Inc SKS.N and Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) if airports stay closed for too long or people cancel trips, said Morningstar analyst Paul Swinand. The hurricane hitting on a weekend worsens its impact, he added.  That pain may be compounded following New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s announcement that New York City’s subways, buses and commuter lines, which serve 8 million riders a day, will shut down around noon on Saturday.  Chains such as Target Corp (TGT.N) planned to keep their stores open as long as it is safe for shoppers and workers, and to comply with any evacuation orders.  Walgreen Co WAG.N said it would keep many stores open 24 hours a day to meet demand for supplies. It was still deciding which stores may close because employees might not be able to get to work.  Retailers kept shoppers informed online.  Home Depot, Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) and other chains posted details on their websites.  Whole Foods Market Inc WFM.O, known for its array of organic and natural products, was communicating with customers through local stores’ Facebook pages and other social media.  After rumors spread in West Hartford, Connecticut, that all local stores were out of water, employees of a Whole Foods there took pictures of all the water they had in the store and posted them on the Facebook page, a spokeswoman said.  If retailers have excess merchandise because they lose out on a weekend of the back-to-school shopping season, it “could lead to markdowns in September and October,” said Keith Jelinek, a director of AlixPartners’ global retail practice.  Hastings expects Home Depot to do well, as it has 35 percent more stores than Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) in the affected region. He also expects Newell Rubbermaid Inc (NWL.N) to benefit from demand for storage containers.  Newell shares rose about 1 percent on Friday. Among battery makers, Energizer Holdings Inc (ENR.N) was up almost 2 percent, and Spectrum Brand Holdings (SPB.N) gained nearly 3 percent.  Drugstores and grocery stores should also see a sales lift.  “It helps the supermarkets most because people really stock up,” said BB&T Capital Markets analyst Andrew Wolf, noting Supervalu Inc’s (SVU.N) strength in Boston and Philadelphia, and Safeway Inc SWY.N and Ahold’s AHLN.AS big presence in Washington.  Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co Inc GAPTQ.PK is stocking extra water, ice, bleach and other goods at its A&P, Waldbaum’s and Pathmark chains.  In particular, Irene could affect companies with a strong presence on the East Coast in terms of higher sales before the storm and potential closings once it hits.  BJ’s Wholesale Club BJ.N said 96 of its 190 stores are in the storm’s expected track. They are receiving extra deliveries of items such as batteries, flashlights, generators and groceries, and the Massachusetts-based company’s buyers are working to get water delivered to those locations.  Wal-Mart, which has an emergency operations center in its Bentonville, Arkansas headquarters, is tracking how the storm may affect roughly 600 of its stores and distribution centers.  It has also offered its help to governments in states such as New York, where hurricanes are less common.  “This is obviously not something that they probably plan for on a regular basis,” said Mark Cooper, Wal-Mart’s new senior director of emergency management, “so we just want to make sure that they know we are available to assist.”  ",8262011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-hurricane/home-depot-walmart-grocers-get-boost-from-irene-idUSTRE77P4HK20110826

Wal-Mart, which has an emergency operations center in its Bentonville, Arkansas headquarters, is tracking how the storm may affect roughly 600 of its stores and distribution centers.   It has also offered its help to governments in states such as New York, where hurricanes are less common.   “This is obviously not something that they probably plan for on a regular basis,” said Mark Cooper, Wal-Mart’s new senior director of emergency management, “so we just want to make sure that they know we are available to assist.”  (Reporting by Dhanya Skariachan, Phil Wahba and Ernest Scheyder in New York; Jessica Wohl and Brad Dorfman in Chicago.

79,TGT,"Home Depot, Walmart, grocers get boost from Irene"," * Supercenters, grocers see shoppers stock up before storm   * Other chains likely to see August sales crimped   * Travel pause to cancel high-end sales - analyst   By Dhanya Skariachan and Phil Wahba   NEW YORK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene sent east coast shoppers into stores to stock up on essentials this week, instead of the clothes, notebooks and other supplies that retailers were counting on selling as parents prepare to send their children back to school.   Chains such as Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) were doing brisk business on Friday, selling water, flashlights, batteries and other goods in states standing in Irene’s potential track from the Carolinas to Massachusetts.   “We’re selling things like generators almost as soon as they arrive at the stores in the watch areas,” said Home Depot spokesman Stephen Holmes.   Irene is due to make its first U.S. landfall in North Carolina on Saturday. The storm, which battered Atlantic and Caribbean islands including the Bahamas and the Dominican Republic, is then expected to head to the densely-populated Northeast. [ID:nN1E77P00B]   Those who were not trying to squeeze in one last summer stay on the New Jersey shore or Long Island beaches may have been planning to go to shopping malls to buy clothes, shoes and other items for children that will soon head back to school. Now, those plans will be on hold.   “Nobody is going to go to a mall to buy a pair of jeans,” said Richard Hastings, consumer strategist at Global Hunter Securities.   The back-to-school shopping season is the second-largest spending time for U.S. shoppers behind the winter holidays.   The storm may dent the upcoming index of August sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, by 1.5 percentage points, Hastings said. About two dozen retailers, including department stores and apparel chains, are due to report their monthly tallies on Sept. 1.   It could hurt retailers like Saks Inc SKS.N and Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) if airports stay closed for too long or people cancel their trips, said Morningstar analyst Paul Swinand. The hurricane hitting on a weekend worsens its impact, he added.   Hastings expects Home Depot to do well, as it has 35 percent more stores than Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) in the affected region. He also expects Newell Rubbermaid Inc (NWL.N) to do well as people buy storage containers.   Hastings and others expected to see brisk business at wholesale clubs that sell bulk packs of batteries and water.   At a Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) in New York’s Long Island City neighborhood late Thursday, it was mostly business as usual.   “It’s usually crazy here no matter what day of the week it is,” said manager Rose Ramos. “This is a normal day for us.”   Some items were selling faster than others as Hurricane Irene set its sights on the largest city in the United States. Costco stacked 24-packs of Poland Spring and Glaceau water bottles by its entrance.   “The water is going very quickly,” Ramos said. “People want to stock up.”   Tim Buxton, a missions director at the Times Square Church, stopped in to get supplies for the church’s 22 interns. The church has not decided whether to hold services on Sunday, when the storm is expected to reach New York, he said as he pushed a cart filled with four cases of gallon-water jugs, four packs of bottled water, instant soup and granola bars.   Based on Friday’s storm track from the National Hurricane Center, 96 BJ’s Wholesale Club BJ.N stores in 10 states will be affected, a spokeswoman said. Those stores are receiving extra deliveries of items such as batteries, flashlights, generators and groceries, and the Massachusetts-based company’s buyers are working to get water delivered to those locations.   Target Corp (TGT.N) said it stores merchandise in distribution centers before hurricane season so supplies can be sent to stores where they are needed most.   Walgreen Co WAG.N, CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) and Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N), the nation’s largest drugstore chains, reminded customers to keep a supply of medication on hand and keep medicine bottles in waterproof bags to make it easier to refill prescriptions at out-of-town pharmacies, if necessary.

80,TGT,"Irene likely dented August auto, retail sales","NEW YORK/DETROIT (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene hit the U.S. East Coast at the most inopportune time for many businesses, keeping millions of shoppers away from stores and auto dealerships during what should have been a busy weekend.  Irene struck a wide area from North Carolina to Vermont, inflicting damage on the August sales results that automakers and many big U.S. retailers are set to report later this week.  The weight of low consumer confidence, the stock market and low inventories of Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and Honda Motor Co (7267.T) vehicles are the key reasons auto analysts expect U.S. new vehicle sales to fall in August from July or be flat at best.  Still, analysts predict a 5.2 percent increase from August 2010, though that tally was made before the weekend’s storm shut many East Coast auto dealerships.  “What’s concerning to us is a huge percentage of sales come in the last weekend or the last week of the month so it hit at that really crucial time,” said Edmunds.com analyst Michelle Krebs. “The good news is that sales are better than May and June.”  The storm also forced stores including Macy’s Inc (M.N) and TJ Maxx in New York to close over the weekend, a period when people are more likely to be shopping.  A tally issued by Thomson Reuters on Monday found that analysts expect the 25 retailers in its index — including Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), Target Corp (TGT.N), J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) and Saks Inc SKS.N — to report a 4.7 percent increase in August sales at stores open at least a year, a measure known as same-store sales.  The chains that report monthly sales represent only about 10 percent of retailers, and the storm affected roughly 15 percent of the U.S. population, said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, who lost power at his Connecticut home early on Sunday.  “There will be a few retailers that will use the hurricane as an excuse for poor performance, but these are some of the same people who have been performing poorly for months now,” he said. “Gap’s numbers are going to be lousy this month, Aeropostale’s will not be good, but they were bad before the storm.”  AUTO SALES UP - AND DOWN  As much as a fifth of U.S. auto sales are often generated in the states that were affected by Irene, said Paul Taylor, chief economist with the National Automobile Dealers Association. In those states, August sales will likely be down about 10 percent.  A bigger problem related to Irene may affect September sales as well, Taylor said.  “The real issue is going to be flooding,” he said.  The average forecast of 44 economists surveyed by Reuters was 12.1 million vehicles were sold on an annualized basis, up from 11.5 million a year ago, but off slightly from 12.2 million in July.  Honda appears to be struggling the most. Edmunds.com and TrueCar.com expect Honda’s sales for August to drop by 22 to 25 percent from last August, and for Toyota’s sales to fall 11 percent to 14 percent.  They show General Motors Co’s (GM.N) August sales up 20 percent, Ford Motor Co (F.N) up 12 to 14 percent, Chrysler Group LLC up 21 to 22 percent and Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) up 16 to 22 percent. Chrysler is under the management of Italy’s Fiat SpA. FIA.MI  Jim Ziegler, a dealer consultant who spoke with dozens of dealers on Monday, said August auto sales figures will “definitely take a hit” due to Irene.  Due to power outages and flooding, Ziegler said, customers are not expected to return in big numbers until the upcoming Labor Day weekend in early September.  Still, auto dealers are happy the storm was not as damaging as some had expected.  “Almost everybody has the feeling that they dodged a bullet,” Ziegler said.  Retailers that sell back-to-school items likely felt Irene’s pinch as the storm essentially shut down malls on a weekend when parents normally shop for clothes and notebooks, not bottled water and flashlights.  “This is a major weekend of sales that were planned, but that won’t happen, in one of the most densely populated regions,” said Joel Bines, a managing director of consulting firm AlixPartners.  The damage could take 1 percentage point off August same-store sales, said Bines, adding that leftover merchandise will likely be discounted, damaging gross margins.  Department stores including Penney and Macy’s and such clothing chains as Gap Inc (GPS.N) and Aeropostale Inc ARO.N are seen as most exposed to a slowdown.  Most retailers’ monthly reporting periods ended on Saturday, meaning the pain of Sunday’s missed sales will carry over into September’s tally. Chains that report monthly sales and are heavily exposed to the East Coast include BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc BJ.N and TJX Cos Inc (TJX.N).  Home improvement chains like Home Depot (HD.N) and supermarkets like Supervalu (SVU.N) likely received a boost that will continue as people pump water from their basements and focus on repairs.  However, those chains as well as others such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), do not report monthly sales.  A large portion of back-to-school sales, retailers’ second-most important season after the winter holidays, could be lost for good, especially if it takes time for the transportation infrastructure to get back in place.  “There are millions of dollars in economic activity and productivity that were lost and simply will not and cannot be recouped,” said weather tracking firm Planalytics.

83,TGT,Americans not scrimping on clothes this fall: study,"BANGALORE (Reuters) - Shoppers may not be feeling too good about the economy, but that is not stopping them from adding clothes and shoes to their wardrobes, a recent study shows.  A report by IBM, to be released later on Wednesday, says demand for apparel and accessories will stay strong this fall, as parents spend on their kids, and then on themselves.  “They are buying more clothes than they are other kinds of goods and services,” said Michael Haydock, retail analytics leader at IBM Global Business Services.  “Before the recession people shopped aggressively in all categories. This year, people are not shopping in all categories — in consumer electronics, automobiles, appliances, they are actually staggering their purchases, but (they are) buying more clothes,” he told Reuters.  Haydock expects sales of clothes and shoes to rise 6.3 percent in August, to $19.49 billion. In September, he expects them to rise 6.6 percent.  For the three fall months of August through October, children’s apparel is expected to see an 11.1 percent rise followed by men’s at 5.5 percent and women’s at 3.1 percent.  “Adults are holding back on purchasing for themselves during their back-to-school shopping for the kids. But once the kids are in school, mom and dad will go out and spend in September and October,” Haydock said.  IBM’s report does not break out results from different stores types. Instead, it shows a general trend across specialty retailers like Abercrombie & Fitch, department stores like J.C. Penney Co Inc and discounters like Target Corp.  Specialty apparel retailers, especially those that cater to teens and young adults, are widely expected to lose sales to discounters and department stores this year, as shoppers look for bargains and deals.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index showed increased weakness in August, with the final reading on the overall index of consumer sentiment at 55.7, down from 63.7 the month before.  “People are being a lot more conservative about their purchases, but when they decide what to buy, they are buying,” Haydock said, adding that these numbers are not an indicator of the upcoming holiday season.  “There isn’t necessarily a pattern that we see that says if back-to-school is good that holiday will be good. It’s worth waiting till August results to get to that,” he said.  Several chains are set to report their August sales this week.

The final tally on Thursday, based on reports from 23 retailers, showed sales at stores open at least a year rose 4.4 percent in August, just shy of the 4.6 percent analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters.   Given the unusual events that hit consumer confidence in August — from a Standard & Poor’s downgrade of the U.S. credit rating to volatile stock markets to an earthquake and Hurricane Irene — results were decent, analysts said.   “Despite all these headwinds, consumers still managed to shop for back-to-school at a relatively decent clip,” said Ken Perkins, president of tracking firm Retail Metrics.   Chains were evenly split between those that beat expectations and those that missed.   (For a graphic on same-store sales, click r.reuters.com/hep53s.)   Discounters like BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc BJ.N and Target Corp (TGT.N) saw a lift in sales ahead of Irene, which hit the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina to New England beginning on Saturday, Aug. 27, causing the worst flooding in decades in areas of New York, New Jersey and Vermont.   Shoppers along the Eastern Seaboard stocked up on necessities like batteries, flashlights and bottled water.   But clothing and department stores such as J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) and Macy’s Inc (M.N) lost sales as stores closed in what could have been a big shopping weekend for families.   Oppenheimer apparel analyst Pamela Quintiliano estimated Irene reduced results at clothing and department stores by 1 to 2 percentage points.   The Standard & Poor's Retail Index .RLX was down 1 percent in afternoon trading, compared with a 0.8 percent drop in the wider S&P 500 .SPX.   STORM RAINS ON BACK-TO-SCHOOL   August is the peak of back-to-school shopping, the second most important period for U.S. retailers after the year-end holiday season.   Sales in recent months have held up despite weak economic indicators, offering hope for August and the rest of the year. The latest retail data shouldn’t derail those expectations.   “You can’t be over-exuberant about it, but I think you’re seeing steady progress,” Barbara Kahn, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, said of the retail landscape.   The International Council of Shopping Centers expects overall same-store sales to rise 4 to 5 percent in September, after a gain of 4.6 percent in August.   Macy’s, which closed more than 100 stores for all or part of last Saturday due to Irene, said the storm shaved about 1.5 percentage points from its August same-store sales. Still, it posted a 5 percent increase, topping analysts’ average estimate of 4.5 percent.   “We expect the hurricane’s effect on sales will be substantially offset as we move through September and the third quarter,” said Macy’s Chief Executive Officer Terry Lundgren.   J.C. Penney and TJX Cos Inc (TJX.N) missed sales estimates and blamed the storm.   TJX, operator of the off-price TJ Maxx chain, reported a 1 percent same-store sales gain, below a 2 percent forecast. Following Irene, it said business rebounded solidly early in the September reporting period, leaving it comfortable with its quarterly sales and earnings forecasts.   Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N), whose sales also came in lower than expected, blamed weak traffic at its stores and said it would focus on lowering prices this fall to “reverse this trend.”   The monthly sales tally speaks to the strength of consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70 percent of U.S. economic activity.   The storm’s full sales impact will not be known until September’s monthly report, since many retailers’ August reporting periods ended on Saturday.   Many major retailers that saw brisk storm-related business, such as grocers, Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), do not release monthly results.   But those that do showed significant gains. BJ’s same-store sales rose 11.5 percent, blowing past analysts’ forecast of 7.8 percent, according to Thomson Reuters.   Target beat analysts’ forecast for a 3.5 percent gain with a 4.1 percent increase. The company said the pre-storm rush lifted same-store sales by about 0.5 percentage point in August and would reduce them in September by a little less than that. It sees September same-store sales up at a low- to mid-single-digit rate.   While “the pace of the economic recovery is uneven and uncertain,” Target had solid results in the back-to-school and back-to-college categories, said CEO Gregg Steinhafel. The discounter benefited from moves such as putting dorm-sized refrigerators next to clothing in some stores.   Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), the largest U.S. warehouse club and the biggest retailer to report monthly same-store sales, posted a higher-than-expected 11 percent rise.   “August was a period like many others for Costco throughout the economic recovery, showcasing an upper-middle-income consumer continuing to be fully engaged in the process of saving where applicable,” Wall Street Strategies analyst Brian Sozzi wrote in a research note.   Costco also said legendary co-founder Jim Sinegal plans to step down as CEO in January.

86,TGT,Retailers' August sales just miss Wall St view,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. retailers reported mixed August sales results after Hurricane Irene drove away business at some chains and boosted it at others.  The final tally on Thursday, based on reports from 23 retailers, showed that sales at stores open at least a year rose 4.4 percent in August, just shy of the 4.6 percent rise analysts expected.  The results raise the possibility that certain back-to-school sales are lost for good.  Chains were evenly split between those that beat expectations and those that missed.

Discount stores such as BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc BJ.N and Target Corp (TGT.N) saw a lift in sales ahead of Hurricane Irene, as shoppers along the Atlantic coast stocked up on necessities like batteries, flashlights and bottled water.  BJ’s said same-store sales, including those of gasoline, rose 11.5 percent, blowing past the analysts’ forecast of 7.8 percent, according to Thomson Reuters.

87,TGT,CORRECTED-Aug 31-(OFFICIAL)-Americans not scrimping on clothes this fall - study," (In Aug 31 item, corrects sales forecast in paragraph 5 to $19.103 bln from $19.49 bln after IBM Global Business Services clarified)	   By Nivedita Bhattacharjee	   BANGALORE, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Shoppers may not be feeling too good about the economy, but that is not stopping them from adding clothes and shoes to their wardrobes, a recent study shows. 	   A report by IBM, to be released later on Wednesday, says demand for apparel and accessories will stay strong this fall, as parents spend on their kids, and then on themselves. 	   “They are buying more clothes than they are other kinds of goods and services,” said Michael Haydock, retail analytics leader at IBM Global Business Services. 	   “Before the recession people shopped aggressively in all categories. This year, people are not shopping in all categories — in consumer electronics, automobiles, appliances, they are actually staggering their purchases, but (they are) buying more clothes,” he told Reuters. 	   Haydock expects sales of clothes and shoes to rise 6.3 percent in August, to $19.103 billion. In September, he expects them to rise 6.6 percent.	   For the three fall months of August through October, children’s apparel is expected to see an 11.1 percent rise followed by men’s at 5.5 percent and women’s at 3.1 percent.	   “Adults are holding back on purchasing for themselves during their back-to-school shopping for the kids. But once the kids are in school, mom and dad will go out and spend in September and October,” Haydock said. 	   IBM’s report does not break out results from different stores types. Instead, it shows a general trend across specialty retailers like Abercrombie & Fitch , department stores like J.C. Penney Co Inc and discounters like Target Corp  . 	   Specialty apparel retailers, especially those that cater to teens and young adults, are widely expected to lose sales to discounters and department stores this year, as shoppers look for bargains and deals. 	   The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index showed increased weakness in August, with the final reading on the overall index of consumer sentiment at 55.7, down from 63.7 the month before. 	   “People are being a lot more conservative about their purchases, but when they decide what to buy, they are buying,” Haydock said, adding that these numbers are not an indicator of the upcoming holiday season. 	    “There isn’t necessarily a pattern that we see that says if back-to-school is good that holiday will be good. It’s worth waiting till August results to get to that,” he said. 	   Several chains are set to report their August sales this week. Sales at stores open at least a year are expected to rise 4.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters.

89,TGT,Exclusive: Holiday shoppers to spend less,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Most than a quarter of Americans expect to spend less during the holidays this year, a survey showed on Monday in an early sign that retailers will have to try harder to win shoppers in the biggest selling season of the year.  The findings underscore the fragility of the U.S. recovery, since consumer spending accounts for almost 70 percent of the nation’s economy.  About 27 percent of people surveyed by America’s Research Group said they planned to spend less this year, while about 55 percent expects to spend only as much as last year.  The question was one of several asked exclusively for Reuters as part of a larger America’s Research Group survey.  More than half of those surveyed said they expected the economy to slow further before it recovers. About 51 percent said they did not feel better about their family finances than they did a year earlier.  “Retailers better be worried about Christmas,” America’s Research Group President Britt Beemer said in an interview. “If half of Americans believe it is going to be worse before it gets better, they may not be too excited about buying much this Christmas season.”  Only about 18 percent of Americans plan to spend more this holiday season, down from 23 percent last year, in a worrying sign ahead of a period when some U.S. retailers make as much as a third of their annual sales.  “This is not the kind of number that retailers want to have going into November 1 or they are going to be in big trouble,” Beemer said. “They are going to have to give consumers better deals earlier.”  Fewer pay raises, falling home values, rising prices for food and other goods, and political gridlock in Washington are all taking a toll on Americans, Beemer said.  “Not that there is no hope at the end of the tunnel, but the light is very, very dim,” he said.  Post-recession American shoppers are extremely sensitive to price and continue to chase bargains, according to both the shopper survey and recent data on credit card spending.  Heavy back-to-school promotions pushed credit card spending up in August, figures from U.S. payment processing company First Data Corp show.  The unit of private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co found overall dollar volume rose 9 percent in August from a year earlier, but the average purchase increased only 0.3 percent.  “In August, consumers were drawn to stores by aggressive back-to-school promotions,” said Silvio Tavares, senior vice president and division manager of First Data Information and Analytics Solutions. “These sales increased overall card spending despite lower average prices.”  Budget-conscious shoppers are also venturing beyond discount chains while hunting for bargains, the America’s Research Group survey showed.  About 68 percent of those surveyed said they had started shopping at dollar stores, and 42 percent said dollar stores offered better value than discounter Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  That is also bad news for other mass merchandisers such as Target Corp and even Family Dollar Stores Inc and Dollar General Corp, which despite their names also sell goods priced above $1.  “Anybody who is another discounter that sells commodities is vulnerable,” Beemer said. “Dollar stores are attacking them at their lowest price level.”  The telephone survey of 1,000 consumers took place was conducted September 6-8 and has an error factor of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.

90,TGT,Holiday shoppers plan to spend less this year,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Most Americans expect to spend less or the same on the holidays this year compared with last year, a survey showed on Monday, an early sign that retailers will have to try harder to win shoppers in the biggest selling season of the year.  A whopping 82 percent of those surveyed by America’s Research Group said they planned to spend less or the same as last year. Consumer spending accounts for almost 70 percent of the U.S. economy.

Target recently took over running its website from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and the Missoni launch was the first major initiative for the retailer since that change.   Patrons were seen lining up in stores in Chicago, New Jersey and elsewhere to check out the goods from the high-end Italian fashion house known for its bold knit designs.   “Due to an overwhelming amount of traffic to Target.com as a result of the Missoni launch this morning, guests are unable to access the site,” Target said in a statement.   Shoppers snapped up everything from glassware to bicycles, bath towels and clothing, leaving others empty-handed.   Among them was “The Office” actress Mindy Kaling, who tweeted: “@target broke my heart today when I could not access their site once in 9 hours for Missoni.”   The retailer, which previously has offered limited-time lines from exclusive designers such as Jean Paul Gaultier and Alexander McQueen, said it was working to get the site back up as soon as possible and apologized for the inconvenience caused by the outage.

93,TGT,Kleenex hopes cooling tissue will heat up sales,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Kleenex is hoping that consumers will pay significantly more per tissue to soothe their noses with coconut oil, aloe extract and ingredients often used in anti-aging creams.  The patent-protected Kleenex Cool Touch tissues cost about 65 percent more than other premium Kleenex tissues, but Kleenex owner Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N) thinks that consumers will be willing to pay extra, despite an economy that may be bordering on a double-dip recession.  Kleenex, which debuted in the 1920s, is a big business for Kimberly-Clark and one that is gaining market share even though shoppers have traded down to store branded goods in other categories such as paper towels and food.  Now, Kleenex hopes that despite the difficult economic climate, U.S. households will buy more than the average five boxes of tissues they purchase each year. A lot of that buying comes during the fall and winter, when cold and flu rates soar.  Kleenex Cool Touch tissues feel thicker than traditional tissues and react with body temperature to send a cooling sensation to people’s noses. They also cost a lot more than regular Kleenex.  “Consumers are willing to pay a premium for what they perceive to be a value-added benefit,” Craig Smith, Kleenex brand director, said in an interview.  In Kleenex’s research, shoppers were even willing to pay more than the price the company set for the new tissues, said Tracy Buelow, Kleenex senior brand manager.  Kleenex Cool Touch have a suggested price of $2.19 for a box of 50, or 4.38 cents per tissue, though initial prices will likely be lower to get people to try them. Kleenex lotion and ultra soft tissues, two other high-end varieties, go for $1.99 for a box of 75 tissues, or roughly 2.65 cents per tissue.  “Innovation has to come without the price, that’s the problem that we have in this environment,” said RBC Capital Markets household products analyst Jason Gere, who has an “outperform” rating on Kimberly-Clark.  “As long as the sticker price seems more in line with some of the other products out there it should do OK,” Gere said, referring to the price per box, not per tissue.  Tissues are one category where store branded products have had less of an impact. Different varieties of Kleenex rang up more than $461 million in U.S. sales during the 52 weeks ended on August 7, excluding sales at Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and wholesale chains such as Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), according to data from Chicago-based SymphonyIRI Group. While sales of Kleenex increased, sales of private label tissues fell, according to the firm’s data.  Kimberly-Clark said Kleenex gained 2 percentage points of market share in North America during the second quarter. Puffs, from Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), are a distant No. 2 player in the category.  “If you have a consumer who wants the lotion and all of that stuff they’re going to stick with a brand, whether it’s Kleenex or Puffs,” said Gere.  While Kimberly-Clark appears comfortable with its Kleenex pricing strategy for now, the company is keeping an eye on prices for northern bleached softwood kraft, a benchmark for pulp paper prices in the industry. The company is cutting costs to help offset the higher material costs it faces and is raising some prices.  Kimberly-Clark is basing expectations for the year on the price of pulp staying between $1,000 and $1,020 per metric ton, versus $970 in the first quarter and $1,030 in the second quarter, Chief Executive Tom Falk said during a July conference call.

We are not playing just to defend against them. We want to beat them. There is no doubt about that,” Storch said of mass merchants such as Wal-Mart and Target Corp (TGT.N).  Toy stores took market share from mass market discounters in the 2010 holiday quarter, data from NPD showed. Toy stores picked up one-half a share point, while the mass merchants and discount retailers lost 3 share points.  Winning over shoppers may be tougher this year.  More than a quarter of Americans expect to spend less during the 2011 holiday season, a survey showed, signaling that retailers must try harder to win shoppers.  “It is certainly clear that any reasonable expectation would be that the economy will be sluggish for a long time to come,” Storch said. “That doesn’t mean that we can’t succeed.”  Toys R Us is getting an early start to the holiday season, bringing out its first-ever catalog of “Only at Toys R Us” items this weekend.  The winter holiday season traditionally runs from the day after U.S. Thanksgiving through Christmas and is the most important time of year for retailers.  Toys R Us rings up more than 40 percent of its annual sales during the holiday season. This year’s period is even more vital as the results will weigh on its plan to go public.  Toys R Us, which operates stores under its namesake brand, Babies R Us and FAO Schwarz, filed for an IPO of up to $800 million in May 2010. But it is not expected to go public until 2012, two sources told Reuters in early July.  Toys R Us plans to step up promotions on its web site and Facebook and carry more products online to appeal to parents who want to avoid heading into crowded stores.  “I am a huge believer in the Internet,” Storch said.  Toys R Us, which saw its e-commerce sales rise 30 percent to $782 million in 2010, recently invested in a new distribution center in Nevada equipped with robots to reduce turnaround time for online orders.  The focus on e-commerce is one reason Toys R Us is opening fewer temporary U.S. stores this year. Last year, it opened about 600 temporary stores, more than six times what it opened in 2009. This year, it will open between 90 and 600.  Still, Storch sees seasonal hiring close to last year’s level. The company, which hired 45,000 seasonal workers last year, has not yet finalized its hiring numbers.

97,TGT,Fund manager Ackman looks to Hong Kong dollar,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager William Ackman, best known for selecting stocks, said he was buying the Hong Kong dollar, noting that it could become his biggest bet ever.  The manager of New York-based Pershing Square Capital Management, said he believes that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will eventually allow the currency to appreciate dramatically against the U.S. dollar.  For nearly three decades the Hong Kong dollar has been pegged to the greenback. The link has pushed up inflation in Hong Kong and increased local debt levels.  The fund manager, who oversees about $10 billion, made the disclosure at the Delivering Alpha conference sponsored by CNBC and Institutional Investor.  Ackman said the Hong Kong dollar is cheap right now and if this bet works out it could become extremely lucrative for his investors. Even a small appreciation of the Hong Kong dollar above its current 7.8 to US$1 exchange rate will pay off big, Ackman said.  Known largely as an activist investor who has prodded U.S. corporations to change, Ackman underscored that he was not pushing a foreign government to do anything here.  “I am looking for hedges, I like asymmetry. And after some digging around, I came up with this.”  So far Ackman’s biggest winner has been General Growth Properties (GGP.N), the shopping mall operator which emerged from bankruptcy in November 2010. Its stock surged to a 52-week high of $17.43 in July.  Ackman has made his reputation by sticking largely to U.S. stocks, including retailers like JC Penney (JPC.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N).  Nearly 20 years ago another hedge fund manager, George Soros, earned about $1 billion by betting against the British pound. Ackman, who like Soros has become one of the industry’s best known and most closely watched managers, said he was not emulating Soros. But the two men play tennis together from time to time and have offices in the same midtown Manhattan building.

100,TGT,Analysis: Wary retailers play safe with holiday hiring,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - People looking for a temporary retail job this holiday season will have better luck at dollar stores and discounters than at department stores and middle market apparel chains, as the anemic U.S. economy keeps other retailers cautious.  Discounter Target Corp (TGT.N), which hired more than 92,000 seasonal workers last year, and home shopping channel QVC Inc LQCVI.UL are among the few that plan to hire more temporary workers.  “The biggest area (of hiring) will be in the discounters, who will have new shoppers in their stores who are moving down from the middle market. The upper end seems to be fairly stable, but it is the middle end of the spectrum that I think will be very minimalist in their hiring,” said John Challenger, chief executive of global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.  Chains including J.C. Penney (JCP.N), Kohl’s (KSS.N), GameStop (GME.N), Toys R Us TOY.UL and Crate & Barrel told Reuters they plan to hire roughly the same number of seasonal workers as last year.  “They are being very conservative because they just don’t know what to expect,” Elizabeth Moughan, senior manager of retail and hospitality marketing at Kronos, said. “There was a little bit of false optimism for a while.”  But that was earlier this year, before fear of the slowing U.S. economy took hold. Consumer spending accounts for almost 70 percent of the economy.  “If you had asked me 4-5 months ago, I think they were much more optimistic,” Challenger said, referring to retailers. “We have now had consecutive quarters where the GDP has been revised downwards.”  A quarter of the retailers surveyed by the Hay Group said they were hiring fewer seasonal workers this year, while more than two-thirds see seasonal hiring at the same level as last year. Only 10 percent plan to hire more.  The survey included responses from chains including Charlotte Russe, Coldwater Creek CWTR.O, DSW (DSW.N), Macy's (M.N), Michael's Stores and Pier 1 (PIR.N). For a graphic on holiday hiring, click r.reuters.com/nex73s More than a quarter of Americans surveyed by America’s Research Group said they planned to spend less this holiday season.  In addition to hard-to-please shoppers, retailers face rising costs of cotton and other raw materials, forcing them to find other ways to save money.  “They are ... looking to sell a lot more product with less promotion and probably with less inventory, which means less product in the store, which means you need less people to help push the product through the store,” Craig Rowley, vice president of Hay Group’s retail practice, said.  A bigger push to sell online is another reason why retailers are seeking fewer temporary workers in stores during the biggest selling season of the year, retail experts said.  “E-commerce is rocking and rolling, and more and more customers are willing to go online to do their shopping, and more and more retailers are creating a very effective ecommerce strategy,” Rowley said. “That is taking some of the sales out of the stores.”  Nineteen percent of chains said they will hire fewer seasonal staffers in stores this year due to the increase in their online sales, Hay Group said. This decline may be offset by the 19 percent that say they will hire more seasonal workers in distribution centers to support the uptick in online orders.  Many chains will delay holiday hiring because they can afford to do it.  “Retailers will have the luxury of being very choosy about who they hire because there will be many who want those jobs,” Challenger said. “Many retailers wait until they see people in their stores.”  “In the past, people would double their staff levels for holiday shopping. We are just not seeing them do that,” said Becca Dernberger, vice-president of Manpower’s (MAN.N) Northeast Division. “There is a wait and see approach.”  Merchants agreed.  “Over the last two years, we have hired seasonal workers a bit later than in previous years,” Melissa Childers, manager of corporate recruitment at Crate & Barrel, said.  Merchants have also becoming better at finding other ways to get work done.  “Retailers manage not just the headcount but the hours that they use,” Daniel Butler with the National Retail Federation said, adding that many chains now have “floater staff.”  “From time to time, they are not on their regular staff, they don’t show up on the regular schedules but they come and work holidays and big promotions and help cover vacations, kind of on an on-call basis,” Butler said.

101,TGT,HOW TO PLAY IT-Stocks that inspire consumer confidence," THE ISSUE: The Thomson Reuters/U of Michigan’s Consumer Confidence index rose slightly more than expected but remained at nearly the lowest level in years at 57.8. In a healthy economy, it would be over 70 percent.   By Sam Forgione   NEW YORK, Sept 16  (Reuters) - Consumers are still gloomy, and the retailing recovery that had been expected has failed to materialize.   That’s a disappointment for the investors who steadily boosted the S&P Retailing index from last August through July of this year. It has fallen since, in step with sagging reports on confidence like the one reported Friday.   What’s eating consumers? Unemployment is hovering around 9 percent. Add to it fears surrounding the U.S. debt ceiling and ratings down-grade and the Euro-zone crisis, and overall expectations have been at historic lows.   What should investors do? Avoid the sector all together?   In the view of three experts who follow the industry, it’s time to be picky.    Here are views of three experts on how to find companies that inspire confidence even when the Consumer Confidence survey sags:      One strategist, Kate Warne at Edward Jones, cited retail and consumer stocks that do well regardless of consumer confidence.   Among her retailing favorites, Kohl’s (KSS.N) was up 61 cents to $47.59 in afternoon trading or 1.30 percent, Target (TGT.N) was up $1.19 to $52.89 or 2.3 percent,  Tiffany (TIF.N) was up 55 cents to $75.38 in afternoon trading.   Her list topped the overall gain of the Standard & Poor’s Retailing Index .XRT which was up a modest half a percent.   In the broader consumer sector, she cited Colgate Palmolive (CL.N) , which was  up  1.15 percent to $93.35, and Procter & Gamble (PG.N) up $1.69 or 2.68 percent to $64.46.   She pointed to solid brands and retailers who can manage in a weak environment.    “Whether confident or not, consumers are going to buy toothpaste,” said Warne, explaining her choice of the two consumer giants.   “Kohl’s has a long track record of delivering good value for consumers. People are shifting to cheaper items and spending less,” she said.   Ross Stores Inc.(ROST.O), which specializes in low-priced brand merchandise and Limited Brands Inc.LTD.N, with moderately priced women’s fashion, are also safe choices for investors, according to another strategist   “We continue to believe LTD (Limited) and ROST (Ross) are well positioned for the second half given strong top-line momentum and the relatively lower cost pressure they face compared to many apparel retailers,” reported Paul Lejuez, CFA of Nomura Holdings, in a research note.   A third strategist is undaunted by the sluggish confidence report and sees the anticipated recovery still on track. The key test for the sector will come in the big season ahead as holidays approach.   “When looking into Q2 results from retailers, for the most part, reporting is in line with expectations. We haven’t seen any major indications of them pulling back yet,” said John Long, retail strategist at Kurt Salmon.   Long also cites back-to-school spending as a bright sign.”If we look at back-to-school as a bellwether for holiday sales, which history indicates is the case, then retailers will have a good season, and only a major unforeseen event could change that.”    ",9162011,http://www.reuters.com/article/howtoplayit-consumer/how-to-play-it-stocks-that-inspire-consumer-confidence-idUSS1E78F0UU20110916
102,TGT,"SoCal grocers, union avert strike with deal","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Albertsons, Ralphs and Vons and the union representing their Southern California supermarket employees reached a tentative agreement on a new labor contract on Monday, averting a threatened strike.  Negotiators for the United Food and Commercial Workers union said the new contract, which must be approved by union members, will cover 62,000 union supermarket workers in Southern California when it is ratified.  “The agreement increases wages, protects health care and pension benefits throughout the life of the three-year contract,” UFCW said in a statement.  The deal came after a negotiating session lasting more than 24 hours. Specific details were not released.  Southern California is one of the most competitive food retailing markets in the United States. Many analyst see the region as a trend-setter for the rest of the industry.  Parties to the latest talks were involved in a bitter 141-day strike in Southern California that spanned 2003 and 2004. It was the longest work stoppage in the history of the U.S. grocery industry, costing an estimated $1.5 billion in lost sales to competitors and permanently shifting the loyalties of some shoppers.  Since that time, nonunion food sellers ranging from Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp and Target Corp have been chipping away at their overall market share. At the same time niche players, ranging from upscale grocer Whole Foods Market Inc to ethnic chains and even dollar stores, have taken a bite.  “We are pleased to have reached a tentative settlement agreement with the union that continues to preserve good wages, secure pensions and access to quality, affordable health care - while allowing us to be competitive in the marketplace,” the grocers said in a joint statement on Monday.  Analysts said both sides had something to lose in the event of a strike. That’s because such standoffs can accelerate store closures, contribute to market share losses and ultimately reduce the number of union jobs.  “The contract is probably mutual pain and compromise,” BB&T Capital Markets analyst Andrew Wolf told Reuters.  The shares in Kroger Co, which operates Ralphs stores, closed up 0.04 percent at $22.38 amid a broader market sell-off prompted by European debt fears.  Vons owner Safeway Inc finished down almost 0.2 percent at $17.67.  Albertsons parent Supervalu Inc saw its volatile shares fall 3.5 percent to close at $7.42. Supervalu — which has been cutting workers, closing stores, selling assets and paying down debt — has lagged many of its rivals in recent years and could least afford a strike.  The UFCW, frustrated over unproductive negotiations on wages and healthcare, increased pressure on the supermarkets when it canceled its extended contract, effective Sunday night. That action opened the door for it to call a strike and sparked intense negotiations.

The United Food and Commercial Workers union on Thursday issued a required 72-hour notice of its plan to cancel its extended contract, a move that opened the door for workers to strike if an acceptable deal could not be reached.  “Albertsons, Ralphs and Vons are still at the table with the union. Progress is being made, but we do not yet have an agreement,” said Jeff Swanson, a spokesman for Albertsons parent Supervalu Inc.  Kroger Co owns Ralphs and Safeway Inc operates Vons and Pavilions stores. The three supermarket companies are negotiating jointly, as they have in the past.  A spokesman for the union confirmed that the parties were still in talks.  The three grocers and UFCW were involved in the 2003-04 strike that at 141 days was the longest in the history of the U.S. grocery industry. It caused some shoppers to permanently shift business away from the region’s “big three” supermarkets and caused financial hardship for many striking workers.  Roughly 54,000 UFCW union members are employees of the region’s three largest grocers. The 8,000 remaining members are employed by stores that are negotiating separately.  The grocery workers’ contract expired in March and had been renewed on a day-to-day basis.  The opposing sides are deadlocked over employer contributions for healthcare. The union says the proposal from the companies is insufficient to guarantee that healthcare benefits will be covered for the duration of the new contract.

Inc., calling for big changes at the struggling online media giant to lift its stock price. The number of companies being targeted has risen sharply.  By Katya Wachtel  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Daniel Loeb, one of the $2 trillion hedge fund industry’s most successful managers, is going back to his investing roots in pushing for more action at Yahoo after the recent ouster of CEO Carol Bartz.  Yahoo stock is up 7 percent since Loeb’s Third Point revealed its push for change at the Internet portal.  A rising number of companies are becoming targets of investors demanding share-boosting actions.  To date, activists have made formal requests for structural or management changes at 241 U.S. companies, compared to 231 companies for all of 2010, according to Hedge Fund Solutions, a company that tracks activist activity.

How you know which companies they will target?  Damien Park, managing partner of Hedge Fund Solutions, says that in the current environment activists are busy looking at companies that removed anti-takeover provisions and are holding big piles of uncommitted cash.

That’s a more ambitious plan than the two-way breakup McGraw-Hill announced on September 12.  In the case of Yahoo, the stock’s 7 percent rise began with a regulatory filing by Loeb’s Third Point fund September 8. The investor called for even greater management changes at the company.

108,TGT,UPDATE 1-U.S. pharmacy customers less patient - J.D. Power," * Good Neighbor, Target, Publix top pharmacy survey   * Kaiser Permanente again ranks as top mail-order firm   * Customers more satisfied when wait times shorter  (Adds J.D. Power comments, additional rankings)   By Jessica Wohl   Sept 20 (Reuters) - Patients filling prescriptions have become a lot less patient.   Customers who wait less than three minutes to give their prescription information to someone at a chain drugstore have a higher level of satisfaction than those who have to wait longer, according to the J.D. Power and Associates 2011 U.S. National Pharmacy Study released on Tuesday.   In 2010, satisfaction did not significantly fall until after seven minutes, the company said.   J.D. Power measured customer satisfaction with store pharmacies and mail-order companies. Supermarkets had the highest average ranking, followed by drugstores, mail-order pharmacies and mass merchandise stores.   “Having the lowest cost doesn’t always equate with the highest customer satisfaction,” said Rick Millard, senior director of J.D. Power and Associates’ healthcare practice.   Retailers have promoted their pharmacies more heavily in recent years as they try to get customers to visit more often, and to buy other items when they come in to drop off or pick up prescriptions. Grocery stores, warehouse clubs and traditional drugstores offer services such as flu shots and health screenings as well.   The biggest improvement across all categories came from Duane Reade, the New York-based drugstore chain Walgreen bought in 2010. Its ranking went up 36 points to a score of 724 out of a possible 1,000.   “It’s interesting that it didn’t go down, which is sort of what the conventional wisdom is” after a company is acquired, Millard said.   Among drugstore chains, two smaller companies, Good Neighbor Pharmacy and Health Mart, tied for the highest ranking, with a score of 851. The Medicine Shoppe Pharmacy came in third, followed by Walgreen Co WAG.N, Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) and CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) stores.   Among supermarkets, privately held Publix came in first for the second straight year, with a score of 867, followed by another private chain, Wegmans. Both chains typically rank high in customer-satisfaction surveys. Winn-Dixie Stores Inc WINN.O ranked third.   For mail-order pharmacies, overall satisfaction fell from 2010, due mainly to lower satisfaction in prescription ordering and delivery.   Still, fewer customers said they would switch to buying their medications in a store instead of through a mail-order service, possibly because they find going to a store less convenient or because their insurance providers require them to use a mail-order service for certain prescriptions.   Kaiser Permanente Pharmacy was the top-ranked mail-order pharmacy for the third year in a row, with 848 points, followed by Humana Inc’s (HUM.N) RightSourceRx and Express Scripts Inc (ESRX.O). Caremark Mail Service, part of CVS, came in sixth.   Target Corp (TGT.N) was the highest-ranked mass merchandise store for the fifth year in a row, with a score of 846. Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s (WMT.N) Sam’s Club was second, followed by Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O).  The study was based on responses from more than 12,300 customers who filled a new prescription or refilled a prescription during the three months prior to the survey, which was fielded during May and June.   The Department of Veterans Affairs had a higher score, 876, than any company in any of the four categories. However, it was excluded from the official survey rankings since it is only open to U.S. military veterans and their families.   J.D. Power is a unit of McGraw-Hill Cos Inc MHP.N.

110,TGT,Holiday retail sales expected to be tepid,"(Reuters) - U.S. retailers may see more moderate sales gains this holiday season as persistently high unemployment and steeper gasoline and grocery prices prompt shoppers to think twice about spending, according to early forecasts.  Retail sales are expected to rise 3 percent in November and December, a slower pace than the 4.1 percent gains in 2010 and barely more than inflation, research firm ShopperTrak said on Wednesday.  The International Council of Shopping Centers suggested that sales at U.S. shopping centers would rise just 2.2 percent, to $449 billion, after a 5 percent increase in 2010. Kantar Retail, which includes online sales in its forecast, said it expects growth of 2.8 percent, half last year’s rate.  ShopperTrak, which measures foot traffic to stores, said people will head out with a set list of what to buy and spend less time browsing.  “People are going to the malls and the stores less frequently, but when they go there, they know what they’re after,” ShopperTrak Chief Executive Christopher Ainsley told Reuters.  That means retailers will have fewer chances to turn browsers into buyers and will be under pressure to offer attractive selections, better in-store presentations and more targeted customer loyalty programs, Ainsley said.  It could also mean less impulse buying.  Foot traffic is expected to slip 2.2 percent as high gasoline prices prompt fewer shopping trips, ShopperTrak forecast.  Retailers are already girding for battle with each other this fall, especially chains whose shoppers are particularly vulnerable to the economy’s mood swings.  Kohl’s Corp’s (KSS.N) sales were unexpectedly weak in August and the department store chain plans to boost advertising and “sharpen” its prices this fall.  Target Corp (TGT.N) Chief Financial Officer Doug Scovanner said at a conference this month that the discount chain has to compete “vigorously this holiday season for our fair share.”  J.C. Penney Co Inc Chief Executive Myron Ullman said at that same conference: “We have pulled back a bit in terms of our expectations.”  The holiday season can make or break a company’s annual results, accounting for one-third of annual sales in many cases. Last year, according to the National Retail Federation, U.S. holiday sales reached $462 billion, up 5.7 percent over 2009, raising hopes the economic recovery was on solid footing.  But unemployment has barely budged since then and consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest in a generation.  A survey for Reuters this month by America’s Research Group found that 27 percent of Americans plan to spend less this holiday season, while 55 percent plan to spend the same.  Still, no one is expecting a bloodbath at the malls.  Global Hunter Securities analyst Richard Hastings said back-to-school sales have tracked close to the firm’s forecasts and retailers understand the state of the economy and have planned accordingly, being careful about building inventory.  Ullman said at the conference that Penney had planned for a better year but that his chain was keeping a tight lid on inventory, lest Penney find itself forced to offer bigger discounts than planned and lose gross margin if shoppers do not show up.  ShopperTrak estimates that sales of clothing and accessories will rise 2.7 percent and that lower-end chains will have to offer bargains to compete with discounters.  Shares of Macy’s (M.N) and VF Corp, (VFC.N) parent of Nautica and The North Face, were each down 2.4 percent in afternoon trading, while Wal-Mart’s (WMT.N) shares slipped 1 percent.  High-end stores such as Saks Inc SKS.N and Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) will continue to have an advantage over their more affordable peers Penney and Kohl’s.  Sales of electronics will lag other holiday gift categories, rising only 1.2 percent, largely because of the limited number of blockbuster electronic gadgets that will be offered this year, ShopperTrak predicted.  ShopperTrak, which gathers data at 25,000 stores in the United States, does not include online sales, restaurants, automobiles or gasoline in its data.

120,TGT,UPDATE 1-Aetna and CVS latest to offer Medicare drug plan," Oct 3 (Reuters) - Aetna Inc (AET.N) and CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) are jointly offering a U.S. Medicare prescription drug plan, the latest such arrangement between a health insurer and a drugstore chain.   Coventry Health Care Inc CVH.N said over the weekend it would offer a Medicare drug plan in 2012 with Walgreen Co WAG.N and discount retailers Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N), which have pharmacies in their stores.   The Aetna plan, which the companies announced on Monday, has no deductible for generic drugs and will cost $26 per month in premiums. The Coventry plan has an average monthly premium of $25.60 and no annual deductible.   A year ago, Humana Inc (HUM.N) and Wal-Mart teamed up for a Medicare drug plan.   The Aetna-CVS plan deepens the companies’ relationship. Last year, CVS landed a 12-year deal to manage some pharmacy benefits for about 9.7 million Aetna pharmacy members and administer about $9.5 billion in annual drug spending.   Medicare, the U.S. government health coverage program for the elderly and disabled, began offering a drug benefit, known as Medicare Part D, in 2006 through private plans approved by the government.

123,TGT,"Retailers ring up solid September, holidays loom","(Reuters) - Brisk back-to-school shopping benefited many U.S. retailers in September, with strong sales growth at chains from Kohl’s Corp to Nordstrom Inc suggesting optimism for the holiday season.  Shoppers largely brushed off the prolonged economic malaise and the U.S. East Coast’s recovery after Hurricane Irene.  Chains with fresh items enticed shoppers while others were left to question their strategies heading into the critical winter holiday shopping season.  Overall, 23 U.S. retailers posted an average sales gain of 5.1 percent at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, according to Thomson Reuters.  “I’m not saying it’s going to be going to an exceptional or a blow-away holiday, but I wonder if people are being overly pessimistic,” Madison Riley, managing director for retail consulting firm Kurt Salmon, said after reviewing retailers’ September reports.

September sales were “positive signals,” said Janet Hoffman, managing director of Accenture’s retail practice.  “The consumer has done a great job of focusing on their savings, reducing their debt and they are back in the market place, shopping. But they are choosing where they are going to spend their money,” she said.  Meanwhile, new claims for U.S. unemployment benefits rose less than expected last week, hinting at an improvement in labor market conditions.  Holiday season forecasts have largely been tepid as the economy takes its toll on consumer sentiment.

Others were more optimistic.  “Despite being buffeted by the winds of inflation, Irene and unemployment, this back-to-school season was the best since 2006,” said Craig Johnson, president of retail consultant Customer Growth Partners.  Back-to-school sales from July to September rose 6 percent based on his firm’s review, hovering just below its forecast of 6.2 percent.  A 5 percent to 6 percent holiday season gain “is clearly in reach,” Johnson said.  Retailers also are preparing for the holidays by keeping inventories lean to avoid the margin-sapping deep discounts they were forced to take in 2008 and 2009.  Port of Long Beach, California, Executive Director Richard Steinke said retailers were being cautious about building up inventory. In August, imports going through the port — which is a major hub for goods coming from Asia — were down more than 10 percent.  “This traditional gearing up for the holiday season by retailers may not be happening in 2011,” Steinke said in a meeting with Reuters reporters.  Retailers are doing what they can to appeal to shoppers such as Joanna Polowitz, who said she lost her job a month ago and thinks the economy is getting worse.  “I’m definitely holding back, only buying necessities, socks for my son, food because it’s reasonable here,” Polowitz said at a Walmart in North Bergen, New Jersey, on Wednesday. “We’re buckling down, not going to dinner as much.”  Kohl’s said it attracted more shoppers as it launched Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony clothing lines.

125,TGT,Target shoots for brisk holiday electronics season,"* Tablets are hot; Kindles to get their own display * Demand for new Call of Duty game stronger than last year * Electronics promoted weekly in ads starting Oct. 30 By Jessica Wohl Oct 25 (Reuters) - Guns and bloodshed may be the perfect gifts to ensure a merry Christmas for Target Corp . The U.S. discount chain hopes that a new slate of video games, along with gadgets such as e-readers and tablets, will lead to a strong holiday season in the electronics department, an executive said on Tuesday. “Within gaming it’s been a pretty soft industry over the course of the year, but I do think that given the slate of games this fall we should be set up to have a really strong holiday,” said Nik Nayar, Target’s vice president of electronics and gaming. Electronic Arts Inc’s “Battlefield 3” hit stores on Tuesday and fans are placing orders for Activision Blizzard Inc’s “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3,” which debuts on Nov. 8. Target feels “really good” about “Battlefield” and orders for the new “Call of Duty” game are ahead of last year when another version of the game was launched, Nayar said. With the economy weighing on the minds of shoppers, U.S. holiday spending is expected to rise modestly. Target and its competitors are gearing up for what could be a price war. Target matches prices if shoppers find items advertised for less at other stores, so it can compete with the new “Christmas Price Guarantee” that rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc announced on Monday.. On Tuesday, Best Buy Co Inc said it would offer free shipping on online orders from Nov. 1 through Dec. 27. Target, which offers free shipping on online orders of $50 or more, is thinking about its options on matching plans from competitors, Nayar said. Meanwhile, its website crashed on Tuesday for the second time in six weeks. For now, Target will promote its trade-in plan, which gives shoppers Target gift cards when they bring in old electronics, and a 5 percent discount for Target credit card holders. Target will highlight items such as video games and televisions in weekly circulars starting on Oct. 30. Gadgets such as Apple Inc’s iPhone and iPad, LCD televisions and e-readers are expected to be hot sellers, Nayar said. Amazon.com Inc’s Kindle will get its own display in stores starting next week to let users try the e-reader and the Kindle Fire, which debuts in mid-November. One category getting less attention this year is 3D televisions. All Target stores have one 3D TV in stock, and some have two varieties. “We feel that it still hasn’t caught up to the mainstream consumer,” Nayar said.",10252011,http://www.reuters.com/article/target-electronics/target-shoots-for-brisk-holiday-electronics-season-idUSN1E79O1HY20111025

128,TGT,WRAPUP 5-Lingering anxiety curbs U.S. chain store gains,"* Same-store sales index up 3.4 pct vs 4.5 pct view * Costco, Target, Macy’s, Saks, Limited miss Street views * Penney, Gap comp sales fall * ICSC sees Nov. same-store sales up 3.5-4 pct * S&P; Retail Index up 0.6 pct, S&P; 500 up 1.5 pct  (Updates share prices) By Phil Wahba Nov 3 (Reuters) - Sales at major U.S. retailers rose in October but not as much as Wall Street analysts had thought, showing that consumers are still anxious about the state of the economy as they begin their holiday shopping. Chains up and down the price spectrum, from Macy’s Inc and Saks Inc to those catering to more frugal shoppers such as Target Corp and J.C. Penney Co Inc reported lower-than-expected sales at stores open at least a year. Even as the stock market rose last month, unemployment barely budged, and shoppers faced a barrage of scary headlines last month about the economy that gave them pause about spending, experts said. “This uncertainty, the news changing every day, it causes a freeze,” said Wharton School professor Barbara Kahn. Overall, the 23 major U.S.-based retailers that report monthly results posted a composite 3.4 percent gain in sales at stores open at least a year, according to Thomson Reuters data. That missed the 4.5 percent increase that Wall Street was expecting. but was more than the 1.6 percent gain in October 2010. Retailers that have struggled recently against rivals reported some of the biggest misses: Penney and Gap Inc posted comparable-sales declines. Despite the tepid month, retailers by and large did not lower their own sales and profit forecasts. Macy’s said it still expected a gain of 4 percent to 4.5 percent for the current holiday quarter, while Gap and Limited Brands even raised their outlooks for the just-ended period. Costco, a perennial winner as shoppers seek low prices, reported U.S. same-store sales rose 9 percent, which were below Wall Street forecasts of 9.8 percent. The Standard & Poor’s Retail Index was up 0.6 percent in the afternoon, recovering after earlier losses. That compares with a 1.6 percent rise for the broader S&P; 500. The biggest losers included Saks, down 2 percent, and Target, down 1 percent. Gap shares were up 3.5 percent. Abercrombie & Fitch reported strong U.S. sales in the current quarter, but its shares fell 21 percent after it reported weak international sales. The chain does not report monthly sales. Several companies that have regularly beaten Wall Street forecasts had a disappointing October. Macy’s said sales suffered because of a warm start to the month, which prompted people to delay buying winter clothes. Limited Brands, the parent of Victoria’s Secret, narrowly missed analysts’ estimates with a 6 percent rise in sales at stores open at least a year and forecast a slower pace of gains for November. The International Council of Shopping Centers expects same-store sales to be up 3.5 percent to 4 percent this month. Chief economist Michael Niemira said he expected a “slower but more sustainable pace of growth” in the coming months after several months of large gains. Retailers came off a strong back-to-school season, but that doesn’t mean shoppers are any less careful, analysts said. “Now going into the holiday season, consumers are going to start to be more selective,” said Kurt Salmon retail strategist Megan Donadio. “They want to make sure they are getting value.” Consumer confidence did brighten a bit but was still low compared with historic levels. October is historically the third-smallest month for sales but with holiday shopping starting earlier than ever, the numbers are a foretaste of that all-important season. Bright spots included Kohl’s Corp, which reported a 3.9 percent gain, and Zumiez Inc, which also beat forecasts. Off-price retailers TJX Cos Inc and Ross Stores Inc, which sold designer brands at major discounts, were also big winners. Ross raised its profit forecast. Overall, some analysts faulted Wall Street for underestimating how much caution is still out there. For example, upscale Nordstrom Inc missed analysts’ lofty expecations despite a 5.4 percent same-store sales rise. “This is expectations getting ahead of reality,” said AlixPartners Managing Director Joel Bines. “It’s still a solid performance,” he said of U.S. retail sales reports on Thursday.

Limited Brands , the parent of Victoria’s Secret, reported a 6 percent jump in same-store sales, while teen retailer Zumiez reported a 3.3 percent gain, above Wall Street’s expectations. Costco Wholesale Corp reported a 9 percent increase, helped by higher gasoline prices and shoppers’ continued search for bargains. Overall, 23 major U.S.-based retailers that report monthly results were expected to post an composite gain of 4.5 percent in sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, according to Thomson Reuters data. That would come off a strong back-to-school season and suggest that U.S. shoppers are growing more comfortable spending. Consumer confidence was still low in October compared with historic levels, but did brighten a bit. And U.S. private employers added more jobs than expected last month, according to the ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday. “What we’re seeing right now is a surprisingly resilient consumer,” said Michael McNamara, vice president of research and analysis for MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse. But October is the third-smallest month for sales, with shoppers taking a breather between back-to-school and the holidays. And while shoppers are hitting stores, they are still careful heading into the biggest spending season of the year. “Now going into the holiday season, consumers are going to start to be more selective,” said Kurt Salmon retail strategist Megan Donadio. “They want to make sure they are getting value.” Other retailers set to report October sales later on Thursday include Target Corp , Macy’s Inc and TJX Cos Inc .",11032011,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-retail/corrected-wrapup-1-u-s-chain-store-sales-rise-in-october-idUSN1E7A10TA20111103
130,TGT,Target blames Walmart layaway for toy sales slump,"(Reuters) - Target Corp’s (TGT.N) toy business took a big hit from Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) early in the U.S. holiday shopping season, as Walmart’s return to offering layaway seems to be gaining momentum even before Thanksgiving. Comments from Target’s top executives, made after the chain posted a much better-than-expected third-quarter profit, showed that the chic discount chain may be suffering from its plan to wait until next week to unveil its Black Friday plans and largely stick to familiar strategies while others such as Walmart tweak their tried-and-true pitches. Walmart, the largest retailer, brought back holiday layaway on toys and electronics in October after a five-year hiatus. It has been advertising a lot more, including releasing its Black Friday ad last week, and plans to start special sales earlier than ever, at 10 p.m. on Thanksgiving night. “Toys is off to a slow start and I think that’s going to be a bit of an uphill climb for us this year, although we’re still optimistic about the rest of the fourth quarter,” Kathryn Tesija, Target’s executive vice president of merchandising, said during a conference call. “Walmart’s layaway program has certainly hurt us in November.” Target is opening its stores at midnight the day after Thanksgiving, earlier than it has before, but does not plan to reveal its Black Friday specials until the day before Thanksgiving. [ID:nN1E7A8134] It is also offering its card holders free shipping online, hoping to woo shoppers away from sites such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Shares of Target, up as much as 3.4 percent earlier in the day, were up 1.3 percent in afternoon trading. This year’s early promotional push has led some shoppers to buy. According to a new National Retail Federation survey, 51.4 percent of Americans had already started holiday shopping in early November, up from 48.9 percent last year. Target said the early release of Black Friday deals by competitors has led people to do more comparison shopping. The U.S. discount chain also indicated that this quarter’s profit may be better than Wall Street has been anticipating. It expects sales at existing stores to rise about 4 percent during the fourth quarter that ends in January, relatively in line with the past two quarters of this year. It expects shoppers to spend cautiously this quarter. Target, which had forecast a low-to-mid single-digit percentage rise in November same-store sales, said that so far results were in line with its expectations. Still, the number of shoppers at Target is up, while traffic at Walmart U.S. stores continues to decline, albeit at a slower pace, as that company works on winning back patrons. On Tuesday, Wal-Mart’s profit came in just short of expectations. ( For a graphic on Target vs. Wal-Mart, click link.reuters.com/xuv94s ) Target’s profit rose much more than expected, with strong retail margins and shoppers responding to its 5 percent discount for cardholders. The number of transactions at stores open at least a year rose just 0.3 percent, after increasing 0.5 percent in the second quarter, suggesting that expanded food departments and a limited-edition line of Missoni goods did little to lure more shoppers to the stores during the quarter. Target earned $555 million, or 82 cents per share, in the third quarter ended on October 29, up from $535 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. The company had forecast earnings of 70 cents to 75 cents per share, and analysts on average were expecting 74 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Minneapolis-based Target has 1,767 U.S. stores and plans to open some in Canada starting in 2013. Excluding costs from the Canada entry, Target said it had earned 87 cents per share. Gross margin slipped to 30.5 percent from 30.6 percent, but was less of a decline than analysts expected. Third-quarter sales rose 5.4 percent to $16.05 billion. Same-store sales rose 4.3 percent. The average amount spent per transaction at those established stores rose 4.1 percent as shoppers bought more items and prices were higher. Target forecast fourth-quarter earnings of $1.43 to $1.53 per share, excluding certain items. Analysts were looking for a profit of $1.47 per share.

131,TGT,UPDATE 5-Target blames Walmart layaway for toy sales slump,"* Q3 EPS $0.82 vs Wall St view $0.74 * Sees Q4 EPS ex-items $1.43-$1.53 * Toy sales slow so far after Walmart’s layaway push * Shares up 1.3 percent By Jessica Wohl Nov 16 (Reuters) - Target Corp’s toy business took a big hit from Wal-Mart Stores Inc early in the U.S. holiday shopping season, as Walmart’s return to offering layaway seems to be gaining momentum even before Thanksgiving. Comments from Target’s top executives, made after the chain posted a much better-than-expected third-quarter profit, showed that the chic discount chain may be suffering from its plan to wait until next week to unveil its Black Friday plans and largely stick to familiar strategies while others such as Walmart tweak their tried-and-true pitches. Walmart, the largest retailer, brought back holiday layaway on toys and electronics in October after a five-year hiatus. It has been advertising a lot more, including releasing its Black Friday ad last week, and plans to start special sales earlier than ever, at 10 p.m. on Thanksgiving night. “Toys is off to a slow start and I think that’s going to be a bit of an uphill climb for us this year, although we’re still optimistic about the rest of the fourth quarter,” Kathryn Tesija, Target’s executive vice president of merchandising, said during a conference call. “Walmart’s layaway program has certainly hurt us in November.” Target is opening its stores at midnight the day after Thanksgiving, earlier than it has before, but does not plan to reveal its Black Friday specials until the day before Thanksgiving.It is also offering its card holders free shipping online, hoping to woo shoppers away from sites such as Amazon.com Inc . Shares of Target, up as much as 3.4 percent earlier in the day, were up 1.3 percent in afternoon trading. This year’s early promotional push has led some shoppers to buy. According to a new National Retail Federation survey, 51.4 percent of Americans had already started holiday shopping in early November, up from 48.9 percent last year. Target said the early release of Black Friday deals by competitors has led people to do more comparison shopping. The U.S. discount chain also indicated that this quarter’s profit may be better than Wall Street has been anticipating. It expects sales at existing stores to rise about 4 percent during the fourth quarter that ends in January, relatively in line with the past two quarters of this year. It expects shoppers to spend cautiously this quarter. Target, which had forecast a low-to-mid single-digit percentage rise in November same-store sales, said that so far results were in line with its expectations. Still, the number of shoppers at Target is up, while traffic at Walmart U.S. stores continues to decline, albeit at a slower pace, as that company works on winning back patrons.

132,TGT,"UPDATE 3-Children's Place sees strong holiday quarter, shares up","* Q3 EPS $1.33 vs est $1.27 * Sees FY11 EPS $3.24-$3.29 from cont ops vs est $3.22 * Says margins to rise 30-50 bps in FY11 * Shares up 15 percent Nov 17 (Reuters) - Children’s Place Retail Stores Inc  is eyeing a strong end to the year as it expects to keep a tight leash on its merchandise, helping it ride through a highly promotional holiday season with improved margins. Shares of the company were up more than 14 percent at $51.46 on Thursday, recovering their losses since May when it had forecast a weak second quarter. Children’s Place, which competes with chains like Target Corp and Gap Inc’s Old Navy, caters to households with a median annual dual income of about $70,000 — or people who are still leaning on deals and discounts for their shopping. “We have a stronger promotional strategy in place for fourth quarter versus last year,” Chief Executive Jane Elfers said on a conference call with analysts. In the past, the company has made inventory and merchandise missteps that had often led the retailer to discount heavily at the end of each season to get rid of unsold merchandise, hurting margins. Elfers, who took charge of the company last year, has been working to correct those issues with revamped styles in clothes and deals. The company recently appointed former Pepsico Inc  official Lori Tauber Marcus as its marketing chief. “Barring a material weakening of the economy, we firmly believe that the significant progress we have made ... will result in positive comp sales growth, continued gross margin expansion and operating margin expansion in fiscal 2012,” she said. For the third quarter ended Oct. 29, which takes into account sales during the back-to-school-season, the kids’ clothes retailer saw gross margins expanding 110 basis points to 41.3 percent, and expects them to grow 30-50 basis points in the fiscal year. Margins were helped by higher prices on products, but CEO Eflers said even with the new price tags, Children’s Place is priced notably below the mall-based competition by about 30 percent, and in line with other value retailers. The Secaucus, New Jersey-based company also expects to earn more than its earlier forecast this fiscal year. For the third quarter, the company earned $33.7 million, or $1.33 a share, topping analyst estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 7 percent to $484.1 million. Children’s Place shares rose 13 percent to $50.95 Thursday morning before the bell.",11172011,http://www.reuters.com/article/childrensplace/update-3-childrens-place-sees-strong-holiday-quarter-shares-up-idUSL3E7MH20B20111117
133,TGT,Chains brace for season of holiday discounts,"(Reuters) - Retailers trying to woo shoppers with early deals and longer hours this week, and throughout the holiday season, could be putting their profits at risk as shoppers search for bargains and not much else. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Toys R Us and outlet malls are among those hoping that big discounts on Thursday night will attract shoppers hungry for deals after Thanksgiving meals. Others such as Target Corp, Macy’s Inc and Kohl’s Corp will join the fray during the wee hours of Friday, opening their doors hours earlier than in past years. The early sales, along with more advertising spending, show that retailers are taking no chances as they fight for their share of the limited amount shoppers plan to spend. The moves, which include adding staff, securing bargains on video games and offering free shipping, also can eat into profit margins. Gross margins at U.S. department stores and broadline chains are expected to fall an average of 0.4 percentage points this year because of higher product, labor and transportation costs, according Barclays Capital analyst Robert Drbul. Discounts just add to that margin pressure. “If you’re not promotional and you don’t have great product, I think you’re going to have a very challenging time this holiday season,” said Jeff Van Sinderen, senior analyst at B. Riley & Co. Some 152 million shoppers plan to hit stores on November 25, the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, up 10.1 percent from 138 million people last year, according to a survey by the National Retail Federation. “Each time there is an occasion to spend, the consumer seems to come out in force and do exactly that,” said Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold. Van Sinderen said American Eagle Outfitters Inc is one of the best-positioned teen chains early in the holiday season, with a good assortment of items and inventory. American Eagle’s shares have climbed this month, outpacing a small decline in the S&P; retail index and a deeper one in the broader S&P; 500 index. Meanwhile, Pacific Sunwear of California Inc, or PacSun, “fundamentally is still struggling” and Abercrombie & Fitch Co’s plan to be less promotional this season could backfire if other chains offer deep discounts, he said. This year, almost 81 percent of consumers told market research firm NPD that the economy will have an effect on their spending, up from 79 percent in 2010 and 78 percent in 2009. While the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s preliminary reading on U.S. consumer sentiment rose in early November from October, the unemployment rate remains above 9 percent. A survey from the Consumer Federation of America and the Credit Union National Association showed that 41 percent of consumers plan to spend less than they did in 2010, while just 8 percent plan to spend more. Still, holiday spending plans are “substantially stronger than they were” in 2008 and 2009, said Bill Hampel, chief economist at CUNA. Angelo Ojeda, a married father of two, is among those spending more this year even though he has what he calls a “neutral to bad” view on the economy. “There’s a little bit more of a comfort level in terms of employment,” he said on Monday, adding that he plans to shop at Target, Best Buy and Walmart on Black Friday and is allotting most of his budget of about $2,000 toward electronics. While predictions vary, most retail industry experts do not expect to see much growth in sales above inflation. “That’s part of the reason you are seeing the catfight over Black Friday,” said Patty Edwards, chief investment officer at Trutina Financial. “If you are going to open five hours earlier, OK, I’ll open six hours earlier. Click here for a graphic on busy shopping days: link.reuters.com/fen25s Click here for a graphic on U.S. holiday spending: link.reuters.com/ten25s Walmart is counting on early sales, layaway, price matching and other tactics to help it hold on to the shoppers who have come back to the world’s largest chain, pushing sales at its stores into positive territory starting in July. That bodes ill for competitors. “A Black Friday where Walmart is to be the sales winner means no one will be a profit winner,” said Goldman Sachs analyst Adrianne Shapira. Walmart advertised items on the cover of its Black Friday circular at lower prices than last year’s, while others such as Sears Holdings Corp’s Kmart and Sears chains are promoting higher-priced goods, according to Goldman Sachs. Walmart’s decision to bring back layaway has already eaten into toy sales at Target, showcasing the fierce competitive race underway. The toy game will get hotter on Friday when Walmart and Best Buy Co Inc slash prices on some popular video games. Retailers must figure out how to convert shoppers who come in for specific items into loyal customers, experts said. “You are certainly at risk for having that be a one-and-done customer,” said Janet Hoffman, managing director of Accenture’s retail practice. “Customers will switch for price, they will stay for experience.” The calendar also has an impact. There are five Saturdays between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, after just four last year, when Christmas fell on a Saturday. With Christmas landing on a Sunday this year, shoppers have a chance to buy last-minute gifts that could be discounted by chains that did not see stellar business earlier in the month. Also, many Americans have off on Monday, December 26, giving them time to shop for what they really wanted and to start redeeming gift cards, which are popular. Online sales are growing more rapidly than sales at stores as shoppers do more browsing and buying on computers, tablets and mobile phones. U.S. retail e-commerce holiday sales are expected to soar 17 percent to $46.7 billion, while total retail sales should grow about 3 percent this season, according to eMarketer. Fifty-one percent of online retailers plan to offer promotions on Thanksgiving, according to a survey from the National Retail Federation. Retailers such as Best Buy are touting free shipping from their web sites all season, while others such as Walmart will ship for free depending on how much is spent. Potential benefactors include FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc. Both hired more seasonal workers to handle the online shopping-related rush. The NRF expects total sales to rise 2.8 percent to $465.6 billion in November and December combined, after a 5.2 percent rise in 2010.

Walmart’s decision to bring back layaway has already eaten into toy sales at Target, showcasing the fierce competitive race underway.

There are five Saturdays between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, after just four last year, when Christmas fell on a Saturday. With Christmas landing on a Sunday this year, shoppers have a chance to buy last-minute gifts that could be discounted by chains that did not see stellar business earlier in the month. Also, many Americans have off on Monday, December 26, giving them time to shop for what they really wanted and to start redeeming gift cards, which are popular. Online sales are growing more rapidly than sales at stores as shoppers do more browsing and buying on computers, tablets and mobile phones. U.S. retail e-commerce holiday sales are expected to soar 17 percent to $46.7 billion, while total retail sales should grow about 3 percent this season, according to eMarketer. Fifty-one percent of online retailers plan to offer promotions on Thanksgiving, according to a survey from the National Retail Federation. Retailers such as Best Buy are touting free shipping from their web sites all season, while others such as Walmart will ship for free depending on how much is spent. Potential benefactors include FedEx Corp (FDX.N) and United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N). Both hired more seasonal workers to handle the online shopping-related rush.

138,TGT,Target in talks on credit card receivable deal,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Discount retailer Target Corp  said on Wednesday it was in negotiations for the sale of its credit card receivables and a deal could be reached by the end of the year. “We are currently negotiating a potential transaction,” Target said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. “It is possible that a sale agreement could be executed as early as the fourth quarter of 2011.” Target is only looking to sell the debts it is owed by cardholders. It would still keep control of the credit card operations, which are part of a key marketing strategy for the company. Earlier this month, Target Chairman Gregg Steinhafel said the company believed the most likely form of such an announcement would be that it had agreed with a buyer on terms of such a sale and on the nature of an ongoing arrangement with the buyer. In January, Target said it wanted to sell all of its credit card receivables, which totaled $6.7 billion as of Oct. 30, 2010. It sold a 47 percent stake in those loans to JPMorgan Chase & Co in 2008. Credit card portfolios sold at an average premium of 15 percent in 2010, meaning the full business could fetch up to $7.7 billion, analysts have previously said. Proceeds could be reduced by third-party stakes in the receivables.",11232011,http://www.reuters.com/article/target-creditcards/target-in-talks-on-credit-card-receivable-deal-idUSN1E7AM1LV20111123
139,TGT,RPT-PREVIEW-U.S. chains brace for season of holiday discounts,"* Sales start earlier, some stores open on Thanksgiving * Shoppers armed with more price data than ever * Retail stocks have outperformed broad market this month By Jessica Wohl Nov 21 (Reuters) - U.S. retailers trying to woo shoppers with early deals and longer hours this week, and throughout the holiday season, could be putting their profits at risk as shoppers search for bargains and not much else. Wal-Mart Stores Inc , Toys R Us and outlet malls are among those hoping that big discounts on Thursday night will attract shoppers hungry for deals after Thanksgiving meals. Others such as Target Corp , Macy’s Inc and Kohl’s Corp will join the fray during the wee hours of Friday, opening their doors hours earlier than in past years. The early sales, along with more advertising spending, show that retailers are taking no chances as they fight for their share of the limited amount shoppers plan to spend. The moves, which include adding staff, securing bargains on video games and offering free shipping, also can eat into profit margins. Gross margins at U.S. department stores and broadline chains are expected to fall an average of 0.4 percentage points this year because of higher product, labor and transportation costs, according Barclays Capital analyst Robert Drbul. Discounts just add to that margin pressure. “If you’re not promotional and you don’t have great product, I think you’re going to have a very challenging time this holiday season,” said Jeff Van Sinderen, senior analyst at B. Riley & Co. Some 152 million shoppers plan to hit stores on Nov. 25, the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, up 10.1 percent from 138 million people last year, according to a survey by the National Retail Federation. “Each time there is an occasion to spend, the consumer seems to come out in force and do exactly that,” said Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold. Van Sinderen said American Eagle Outfitters Inc is one of the best-positioned teen chains early in the holiday season, with a good assortment of items and inventory. American Eagle’s shares have climbed this month, outpacing a small decline in the S&P; retail index and a deeper one in the broader S&P; 500 index . Meanwhile, Pacific Sunwear of California Inc , or PacSun, “fundamentally is still struggling” and Abercrombie & Fitch Co’s plan to be less promotional this season could backfire if other chains offer deep discounts, he said. This year, almost 81 percent of consumers told market research firm NPD that the economy will have an effect on their spending, up from 79 percent in 2010 and 78 percent in 2009. While the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s preliminary reading on U.S. consumer sentiment rose in early November from October, the unemployment rate remains above 9 percent. A survey from the Consumer Federation of America and the Credit Union National Association showed that 41 percent of consumers plan to spend less than they did in 2010, while just 8 percent plan to spend more. Still, holiday spending plans are “substantially stronger than they were” in 2008 and 2009, said Bill Hampel, chief economist at CUNA. Angelo Ojeda, a married father of two, is among those spending more this year even though he has what he calls a “neutral to bad” view on the economy. “There’s a little bit more of a comfort level in terms of employment,” he said on Monday, adding that he plans to shop at Target, Best Buy and Walmart on Black Friday and is allotting most of his budget of about $2,000 toward electronics. While predictions vary, most retail industry experts do not expect to see much growth in sales above inflation. “That’s part of the reason you are seeing the catfight over Black Friday,” said Patty Edwards, chief investment officer at Trutina Financial. “If you are going to open five hours earlier, OK, I’ll open six hours earlier.

140,TGT,UPDATE 2-Thanksgiving kicks off fight for U.S. holiday sales,"* Wal-Mart, Old Navy, Kmart, Toys R Us, open on Thursday * Kohl’s, Macy’s, Target, Best Buy open at midnight * Old Navy in NJ packed, pitched tent at a Best Buy * Shoppers seek deals, but retailers eye margins By Phil Wahba and Dhanya Skariachan Nov 24 (Reuters) - The holiday shopping season is in full swing on Thursday, with retailers hoping U.S. consumers will spend big despite worries about the fragile economy and their own precarious finances. The shopping period has been underway for some time as retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Toys R Usstarted early by offering layaway programs. But shoppers are looking for major bargains and retail executives are predicting a more competitive season than 2010. An Old Navy store in Watchung, New Jersey, was teeming with shoppers on Thursday morning, while a line outside a Best Buy in Union, N.J., included shoppers who had pitched a tent to stay warm until the store’s midnight opening, according to Charles O’Shea, a Moody’s senior retail analyst. O’Shea said he was visiting various retailers to gauge consumer traffic. The big draws are deals, like t-shirts for $6, down from $12. Bargains like those will be a fixture for the season, he said. “There is no question that the shopper is looking for deals,” O’Shea said. “Nobody wants to feel like they’re leaving money on the table, especially when they have less money now.” Millions of Americans will head out to shop once they are done with their turkey dinners, getting a jump-start on “Black Friday” - the single biggest shopping day of the year, which sets the tone for the entire season. Still, many others will be watching their pennies. Paula Taero, a 58 year-old housekeeper from Queens, New York who was shopping on Thursday at a Kmart in Manhattan, said she is cutting back this year on her Christmas shopping. “Santa will buy for others. I don’t have so much money this year.” Wal-Mart, Old Navy, which is part of Gap Inc and KMart, owned by Sears Holdings’ , are among the few retailers open on Thanksgiving. Toys R Us opens Thursday evening. To narrow the gap in store hours with rivals, discounter Target Corp , electronics chain Best Buy and department store chains Macy’s Inc and Kohl’s Corp will open at midnight - their earliest starts ever. Others, including J.C. Penney Co Inc , are opening early Friday morning as they did last year. The National Retail Federation expects sales in November and December to be up 2.8 percent over last year, but below 2010’s 5.2 percent gain. So retailers, online and offline, see little margin for error. Wal-Mart starts its Black Friday “doorbuster” deals on Thursday at 10 p.m. at its stores. Amazon.com Inc , not to be outdone, will offer its deals online at 9 p.m. Newspaper inserts on Thursday morning were boasting of the usual “Black Friday” bargains to get people into stores. For example, Staples Inc was offering an ink jet printer for 60 percent off, while Target was offering 46-inch, high-definition televisions for about 45 percent off. The knock-down-drag-out fight comes as the rebound in sales cooled in October, when many top chains like Macy’s and Saks reported disappointing sales. It will be even tougher for chains that have struggled with sales declines lately, like Gap and Penney. The NRF expects 152 million people to hit stores this weekend, up 10.1 percent from last year. But much of that traffic will be fueled by bargain hunting, analysts said, with the real test coming after the weekend when retailers see if spending happens only if there are big bargains on the table. Last year, after a strong Black Friday weekend, shoppers sat on their hands until closer to Christmas. This year, those looking for steals beyond the requisite “Black Friday” specials may be disappointed. In a research note on Tuesday, Wells Fargo economist Mark Vitner said: “Bargain hunters may have a tougher time finding those markdowns this year, as retailers are keeping a sharper eye on profit margins.” Either way, middle class shoppers are also more frugal now, taking a page from their lower income counterparts, Andrew Stein, vice president of marketing planning at Sears Holdings told Reuters. “The Kmart customer has always been a value shopper. The rest of the country is behaving like the Kmart shopper now,” he said, noting that there were a lot of people at Kmart’s layaway lines on Thursday.",11242011,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-retail-thanksgiving/update-2-thanksgiving-kicks-off-fight-for-u-s-holiday-sales-idUSN1E7AN0FR20111124
141,TGT,Midnight Black Friday start likely to become norm,"(Reuters) - Earlier than ever store openings at Macy’s Inc, Target Corp and Best Buy Inc this year were such hits with shoppers that their midnight start on Black Friday will likely become the norm. Macy’s said about 10,000 people thronged its Manhattan flagship at midnight on Thursday, while a Best Buy store in Union, New Jersey, had people lined up for hours before. Most retailers last year kicked off Black Friday at 4 a.m. But this year, some decided not to cede an inch of opportunity to rivals. And the strategy seems paid off. “Now that we’re open at midnight, we’re getting an entirely different customer,” Macy’s Chief Executive Terry Lundgren told Reuters, speaking of night owl shoppers under age 30. More traditional shoppers, who prefer to sleep off turkey dinner before hitting stores, came later in the morning as usual, Lundgren said, giving the chain two waves of customers. The crowds at Macy’s, Target, Best Buy and elsewhere mean midnight openings will be irresistible to more retailers. “After seeing what I saw last night I can’t imagine that this is going to be a one year only shot,” said Charlie O’Shea, senior retail analyst at Moody’s. A major benefit is that it gives shoppers more choices. “I did Black Friday at Target (in a prior year), I stood in line from 12:30 to 6 o’clock in the morning. I don’t have to do it this year,” said Desiree Schoolfield, a 49 year old public servant from Queens shopping at a Toys R Us in Manhattan Wednesday evening. For the retailers, there are competitive considerations in what promises to be a tough holiday season. Soon after Macy’s announced it would move up its Black Friday opening to midnight, rival Kohl’s Corp followed. And it would be unthinkable for Best Buy to be closed while Target is open, and vice versa. Still, some bucked the trend this year and suffered little if any consequence. J.C. Penney Co Inc stuck to its 4 a.m. opening, with the only apparent effect of rivals’ earlier opening being a morning shopper traffic peak that came minutes earlier than last year, said Penney executive Mike Thielmann. At 4:15 am on Friday, the parking lot at North Point Mall in suburban Atlanta, which has a Penney and Macy’s, was 80 percent full, hours after 1,500 lined up for Macy’s opening, said general manager Nick Nicolosi. And the Penney at Newport Center in Jersey City, N.J., was packed in the early morning. Still, analysts say it is just a matter of time before the competitive pressure prompts holdouts to open at midnight too, in a continuation of “store hour creep” that has seen Black Friday sales start earlier and earlier. Only a few years ago, a 6 a.m. start seemed outrageously early.",11252011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-retail-midnight/midnight-black-friday-start-likely-to-become-norm-idUSTRE7AO1UD20111125

143,TGT,"Black Friday draws crowds, but spending in doubt","(Reuters) - Retailers were hoping for more shoppers like Shawn Elzia as the annual Black Friday bargain stampede marked the unofficial start of what is widely expected to be a middling holiday shopping season. The Brooklyn, New York teacher, one of hundreds of thousands of shoppers jostling for deals around the country, said he ended up spending about 25 percent more than he planned, even while worrying about the state of the economy. “I did not expect such deals,” the 33-year old said as he left a Macy’s store in Jersey City, New Jersey clutching bags full of clothing for himself and his family. “It’s slashed down to the bones,” he said. “There were some great discounts if you showed up early.” Deals are always part of the picture on the Friday after Thanksgiving. This year was notable for an earlier opening for some retailers and possibly for the one shopper using pepper spray to make sure she could get a popular video game system. The early start by stores brought out younger shoppers such as Alina Ybarra, who spent the wee hours of the morning with her friends as they all looked for items for themselves. “It’s really chaotic,” Ybarra, 17, said of her first Black Friday outing as she finished her shopping in Santa Monica, California. She said that she liked the deals at stores such as Gap Inc’s Old Navy and Urban Outfitters. “It seems like a lot of teenagers were the primary shoppers, maybe because of the hour, but I think net-net it’s not really going to result in an incremental positive for retailers,” Ed Yruma, senior equity analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said after checking out crowds at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. He said shoppers were not carrying a lot of shopping bags. Leon Clare, 24, and Shawn Sykes, 27, both U.S. Navy Corpsmen, drove about 125 miles from 29 Palms Marine Base to Santa Monica so they each could spend close to $175 on a pair of Air Jordan Retro 3 shoes in “Black Cement,” popular new sneakers from Nike Inc. “This is for me,” said Clare, who plans to spend more on holiday gifts later on in the season. “I’m leaving for Afghanistan in March. I’m getting something for everyone, just in case I don’t come back.” More than 120 stores at the Mall of America opened at midnight. The crowd at that point was about 15,000 people. Mall operators estimated that it was the largest crowd ever at the mall, which is big enough to hold seven Yankee Stadiums. While eager shoppers emerged from stores around the country lugging big-screen TVs and bags full of video games and toys, it was far from certain that people will pull out their wallets for much more than the best deals this year. Shoppers with limited budgets started using layaway at chains such as Walmart as early as October. Retail shares fell more than the overall market on Friday. “Americans are still worried about jobs, still worried about the economy,” said Mike Thielmann, group executive vice president at J.C. Penney, who noted that shoppers were buying gifts and for themselves, and said jewelry was selling well. In Houston, Rico Salvosa, 60, bought two cameras at Best Buy and said he had saved about $170. “It’s worse than before because business is slow,” Salvosa, who wholesales stone countertops, said as he left the store with his daughters. “I don’t have a lot of savings for holiday shopping. I told them, ‘I cannot buy everything that you’d like.’” Competition among the retailers was fierce as it was among shoppers, as some stores opened hours earlier than before. Outside Macy’s flagship store in New York, some Occupy Wall Street activists chanted “boycott Macy’s” and “stop supporting big corporations” even as about 9,000 people lined up to shop when the store opened at midnight. Opening early appeared to work, judging from the long lines at stores such as Macy’s, Toys R Us, Best Buy, Walmart and Target. “It was crazy around midnight and one in the morning,” said a Target employee at the chain’s East Harlem, New York store, where the crowd thinned out later on Friday morning. Even after a Toys R Us in New Jersey had been open for nearly an hour, at 9:50 p.m. EST on Thursday night, there was still a line of about 300 people waiting to get inside. The 24 hours that started at 9 p.m. Thursday will be the biggest in retail history, with sales estimated at $27 billion, according to Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, one of the few experts predicting a strong season. The term “Black Friday” commonly refers to the day after Thanksgiving, the traditional start of the busy holiday shopping season when retailers do brisk business. (See related story: Spirited ‘Black Friday’ has dark roots. While it is the busiest day of the year in terms of store traffic, it does not always mean that sales will soar for the season. Despite brisk sales right after Thanksgiving in 2008 and 2009, total holiday season sales fell as the recession gripped the country. The National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, expects 152 million people to hit stores this weekend, up 10.1 percent from last year. Yet it expects sales for the full November-December holiday season to rise just 2.8 percent, well below the pace of last year when sales rose 5.2 percent. Luxury chains such as Saks Inc and those catering to lower-income shoppers, such as dollar stores, are expected to do well this shopping season. “For our products that are $25,000 and up, growth is phenomenal,” said Mark Vadon, founder of online jewelry retailer Blue Nile. “Price points under $100 are also doing really well. For the mass part of the market, consumers are strapped and being a lot more wary.” Overall, retail executives and analysts expect a more competitive shopping season than in 2010. Unemployment remains at 9 percent, European debt woes are weighing on the stock market, and consumer confidence remains spotty. Online sales on Thursday and Friday surpassed last year, and more shoppers used their mobile devices to buy, according to IBM data. The amount U.S. shoppers spent via eBay Mobile more than doubled on Thanksgiving, while eBay’s PayPal Mobile unit saw a five-fold increase in global mobile payment volume versus last Thanksgiving. The online push put pressure on some companies. Walmart.com saw some very high traffic, so some customers may have experienced delays as they tried to check out, it said. Even Apple Inc gets into the Christmas spirit on Black Friday, the only day that it usually offers discounts. This year it offered its typical $101 discount on its $900-plus Mac laptops and $41 or more off its $499-plus iPads.

Luxury chains such as Saks Inc and those catering to lower-income shoppers, such as dollar stores, are expected to do well this shopping season. “For our products that are $25,000 and up, growth is phenomenal,” said Mark Vadon, founder of online jewelry retailer Blue Nile . “Price points under $100 are also doing really well. For the mass part of the market, consumers are strapped and being a lot more wary.” Overall, retail executives and analysts expect a more competitive shopping season than in 2010. Unemployment remains at 9 percent, European debt woes are weighing on the stock market, and consumer confidence remains spotty. Online sales on Thursday and Friday surpassed last year, and more shoppers used their mobile devices to buy, according to IBM data. The amount U.S. shoppers spent via eBay Mobile more than doubled on Thanksgiving, while eBay’s PayPal Mobile unit saw a five-fold increase in global mobile payment volume versus last Thanksgiving. The online push put pressure on some companies. Walmart.com saw some very high traffic, so some customers may have experienced delays as they tried to check out, it said. Even Apple Inc gets into the Christmas spirit on Black Friday, the only day that it usually offers discounts. This year it offered its typical $101 discount on its $900-plus Mac laptops and $41 or more off its $499-plus iPads.

145,TGT,UPDATE 3-Thanksgiving kicks off fight for U.S. holiday sales,"* Hundreds in line at Toys R Us * Kohl’s, Macy’s, Target, Best Buy open at midnight * Old Navy in NJ packed, pitched tent at a Best Buy * Shoppers bargain-hunting, retailers eye margins * 152 million expected to hit stores this weekend-NRF By Phil Wahba and Dhanya Skariachan Nov 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. holiday shopping season was in full-swing on Thursday, with retailers hoping consumers will spend big despite worries about the fragile economy and their own precarious finances. Stores looking to grab as big a piece as possible of what is expected to be a middling holiday shopping season pushed post-Thanksgiving openings into Thursday evening, getting an early  start on “Black Friday,” the traditional start to the U.S. holiday shopping season. The strategy appeared to be working, judging from the 300  people lined up at a Toys R Us store on Long Island, New York before it opened at 9 p.m. on Thursday. Shoppers were looking for bargains, but customers like James McBreaty were just what retailers were hoping for; those who will also buy things beyond the “doorbuster” deals retailers offer to entice customers. “We came for the deals, but we were just discussing if we will buy things that aren’t discounted,” said McBreaty, 32, a paralegal who was waiting with his wife Nicole. “Most likely the entire store isn’t discounted, but we’re here so we’ll probably buy some crap anyway.” In reality, the shopping period has been underway for some time as retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Toys R Us started early by offering layaway programs. Retailers from Amazon.com to Wal-Mart were also offering online deals as Thanksgiving has become one of the biggest online shopping days of the year. Retail executives and analysts are predicting a more competitive season than 2010. Unemployment still remains at 9 percent, European debt woes are weighing on the stock market and consumer confidence remains spotty. The National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, forecast a 2.8 percent increase in sales for the November-December holiday season, down from the 5.2 percent increase in 2010. Some shoppers even feel as though the recession has returned, even if it has not shown up in economic data. “This year, we are going to do shopping, but I don’t think it is going to be as much shopping as we usually do. Because of the recession, we are not going to shop as much,” said Desiree Schoolfield, 49, a public service profession from Queens who was shopping at the Toys R Us in Times Square. Earlier on Thursday, a line outside a Best Buy in Union, N.J., included shoppers who had pitched a tent to stay warm until the store’s midnight opening, according to Charles O’Shea, a Moody’s senior retail analyst. O’Shea said he was visiting various retailers to gauge consumer traffic. The big draws are deals like t-shirts for $6, down from $12. Bargains like those will be a fixture for the season, he said. “There is no question that the shopper is looking for deals,” O’Shea said. “Nobody wants to feel like they’re leaving money on the table, especially when they have less money now.” The retail federation expects 152 million people to hit stores this weekend, up 10.1 percent from last year. Paula Taero, a 58 year-old housekeeper from Queens, New York who was shopping on Thursday at a Kmart in Manhattan, said she is cutting back this year on her Christmas shopping. “Santa will buy for others. I don’t have so much money this year,” she said. Wal-Mart, Old Navy, which is part of Gap Inc and KMart, owned by Sears Holdings, were among the few retailers open on Thanksgiving. To narrow the gap in store hours with rivals, discounter Target Corp, electronics chain Best Buy and department store chains Macy’s Inc and Kohl’s Corp  will open at midnight, their earliest starts ever. Others, including J.C. Penney Co Inc, are opening early Friday morning as they did last year. Wal-Mart started its Black Friday “doorbuster” deals on Thursday at 10 p.m. at its stores. Amazon.com, not to be outdone, will offer its deals online at 9 p.m. Newspaper inserts on Thursday morning were boasting of the usual Black Friday bargains to get people into stores. For example, Staples Inc was offering an inkjet printer for 60 percent off, while Target was offering 46-inch, high-definition televisions for about 45 percent off. The knock-down-drag-out fight comes as the rebound in sales cooled in October, when many top chains like Macy’s and Saks reported disappointing sales. It will be even tougher for chains that have struggled with sales declines lately, like Gap and Penney. Last year, after a strong Black Friday weekend, shoppers sat on their hands until closer to Christmas. This year, those looking for deals beyond the requisite Black Friday specials may be disappointed. In a research note on Tuesday, Wells Fargo economist Mark Vitner said: “Bargain hunters may have a tougher time finding those markdowns this year, as retailers are keeping a sharper eye on profit margins.” Either way, middle-class shoppers are also more frugal now, taking a page from their lower income counterparts, Andrew Stein, vice president of marketing planning at Sears Holdings told Reuters. “The Kmart customer has always been a value shopper. The rest of the country is behaving like the Kmart shopper now,” he said, noting that there were a lot of people at Kmart’s layaway lines on Thursday.

147,TGT,UPDATE 2-Amazon says Kindle sales surge on Black Friday,"* Four times as many Kindles sold on Black Friday in ‘11 * Kindle Fire outsells iPad at Target on Black Friday * Kindle ‘sharply outselling’ Nook at Best Buy -Goldman By Alistair Barr Nov 28 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Monday it saw a surge in sales of its Kindle devices, helped by its new Kindle Fire tablet, on the crucial “Black Friday” shopping day after Thanksgiving. Consumers bought four times as many Kindles on Black Friday as they did on the same day last year, when the company sold only e-readers, the largest Internet retailer reported. The $199 Fire was the best-selling product on Amazon.com on Black Friday and it has been the top seller over the eight weeks since the tablet was launched, the company added. “We’re seeing a lot of customers buying multiple Kindles - one for themselves and others as gifts - we expect this trend to continue on Cyber Monday and through the holiday shopping season,” said Dave Limp, vice president, Amazon Kindle. Amazon shares were up 6.5 percent at $194.25 on Monday afternoon, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was up 3.4 percent. “If the 4x sales run-rate (vs. 2010) is representative for the entire fourth quarter, then we believe our current Kindle estimates could be conservative,” Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Barclays Capital, wrote in a note to investors. Amazon sold about 3.4 million Kindle e-readers in the fourth quarter of 2010, DiClemente estimated. Data released on Monday by Amazon suggests the company may sell 13.6 million Kindle devices in this year’s fourth quarter, the analyst noted. DiClemente was previously forecasting Kindle sales of 11 million in the fourth quarter, which consisted of 4.5 million Kindle Fire tablets and 6.5 million other Kindle devices. The new Kindle Fire is a crucial part of Amazon’s effort to sell more digital products such as e-books, apps, video games, music and movies. The company is selling the tablet in more than 16,000 retail stores to try to get the device into as many hands as possible. IN-STORE SALES The Kindle Fire was the best-selling tablet in Target Corp stores on Black Friday, Nik Nayar, vice president of merchandising at Target, said in a statement. Target sells several tablets, including the market-leading iPad from Apple Inc . Over Black Friday, Target offered a $75 gift card when customers bought an iPad 2 with 3G. Goldman Sachs analysts visited stores run by Best Buy Co Inc and other retailers in recent days and found that Kindle products were “very sharply outselling” Nook devices from bookseller Barnes & Noble Inc . At stores run by Barnes & Noble, interest in the Nook was “robust,” but the Goldman analysts said extra distribution to other retail stores was having less impact than expected. “Now Amazon has a more competitive suite of hardware, its hardware share should increase, and its ebook share should follow,” the analysts wrote in a note to investors on Monday. Barnes & Noble shares were up 7.3 percent at $17.25 on Monday afternoon.",11282011,http://www.reuters.com/article/amazon-kindle/update-2-amazon-says-kindle-sales-surge-on-black-friday-idUSN1E7AR15O20111128

152,TGT,"Target to host boutiques, and Apple, in stores","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) will soon have exclusive shops selling everything from candy to clothing as the discount chain tries to stand out among the growing ranks of retailers offering trendy, often low-priced merchandise. Target will also have 25 stores featuring special displays of Apple Inc (AAPL.O) merchandise, a move that had been the subject of speculation last week and which the retailer confirmed on Thursday. Target, which is based in Minneapolis, unveiled its “The Shops at Target” concept in New York. Items from boutiques such as Boston’s Polka Dog Bakery, Miami’s The Webster and San Francisco’s The Candy Store will be priced from $1 to $160 and be sold in Target and on its website for six weeks starting in early May. A new collection will then be sold in the fall. Architect and designer Michael Graves’ tea kettles and other home goods helped Target pioneer the concept of higher-end partnerships at mass chains back in 1999. Now Target, which has more than 1,760 U.S. locations, is scouting around the world for unique shops that will co-create merchandise to be sold exclusively through Target. The push comes as Target has watched other chains launch more exclusive goods, such as Kohl’s Corp’s (KSS.N) line of Vera Wang apparel and shoes, and stores within their stores, such as J.C. Penney Co Inc’s (JCP.N) partnership with Sephora for cosmetics boutiques. “We’ve gone through a cycle where everybody looked like everybody else and had the same product mixes and now the way to really differentiate this is to do your own concept shops,” said Roseanne Morrison, fashion director at retail consulting firm The Doneger Group. Target’s plan could be a big payoff for small retailers such as Connecticut’s Privet House, which opened its first store in 2008 and its second in 2009 where it sells a mix of vintage goods and new home accessories. Its Target collection includes melamine plates, cloth napkins and metal planters and bins. At the Privet House stores, glasses might sell for $15 or more, said co-founder Suzanne Cassano. At Target, cups in the Privet House collection for Target will be priced at $3.49 and $3.99. “Good design at any price is good design,” said Richard Lambertson, who started Privet House with Cassano after years in retail including co-founding bag maker Lambertson Truex. The first five shops — The Webster, The Candy Store, PolkaDogBakery, Cos Bar and Privet House — all hail from the United States. International partnerships are also a possibility, said Brian Robinson, Target’s director of fashion and design partnerships. Target has used limited-time designer partnerships to drive sales of apparel and accessories before, including lines from exclusive clothing designers such as Thakoon Panichgul and Zac Posen. September’s Missoni line of products, which included everything from sweaters to a bicycle, proved so popular that it brought down Target’s website on the day of the launch. “That was an unprecedented event,” said Stacia Andersen, Target’s senior vice president of merchandising for home and seasonal goods. Target is trying to balance having the new items in stock, both in stores and online, yet also conveying to shoppers that they are only limited-edition goods, she said. The company could use some momentum after posting disappointing sales at existing stores in November and December and cutting its profit forecast just last week. Lambertson and other store owners partnering with Target said they were not concerned about diluting the value of their brands by working with a retailer known for low-priced goods. Lambertson, for one, already shops at Target and does not refer to the chain as a discounter. Target is a “mass retailer,” he said. Separately, Target said that its board authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion worth of shares over the next two to three years once its current $10 billion buyback program expires in early 2012. Shares of Target closed up 1.6 percent at $49.81 on Thursday. ",1132012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-target-design/target-to-host-boutiques-and-apple-in-stores-idUSTRE80B16120120113

The world’s largest retailer said on Tuesday it would invest more than $750 million in the program. The money will go in part toward the coversion of most of the 39 former Zellers locations that Wal-Mart picked up from Target. Wal-Mart’s rival - the No. 2 U.S. discounter - had purchased dozens of Zellers leases from Hudson’s Bay Co in preparation for its Canadian entry, now set for early 2013. Target then sold off some leases for stores in unwanted locations. Minneapolis-based Target plans to open up to 135 stores in Canada, starting in March or April 2013. By the end of January 2013, Wal-Mart expects to have more than 375 outlets in Canada, up from 333 at the end of January 2012, and 325 a year earlier. Wal-Mart is earmarking much of the spending on its Canadian supercenters, which represent more than half of the 73 projects. Supercenters, which feature a wider array of grocery items than standard Walmart stores, have already put pressure on profit margins at Canadian grocers.

More than half of the projects will be part of the company’s program on supercentres — Wal-Mart stores with the addition of full-service supermarkets — and the rest will be discount stores.

Canadian grocers are facing tough competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc, which is expanding its grocery offerings in Canada. The market will heat up further when Target Corp  enters Canada in the spring of 2013, but the impact on Sobeys may be less than on its rivals due to its agreement to supply U.S. discount retailer Target with groceries.",2082012,http://www.reuters.com/article/empire/update-2-canadas-empire-says-sobeys-ceo-to-retire-idUSL2E8D86P720120208
156,TGT,"Kohl's forecast disappoints, Target sees pickup","(Reuters) - Department-store operator Kohl’s Corp on Thursday gave a profit forecast that came in below Wall Street expectations this year as customers balked at its attempts to pass on rising costs, while Target Corp said it would be helped by its credit card business. Results and forecasts from those two retailers showed that consumers at the low to mid-end of the U.S. economy are pressured by rising gasoline prices and still high unemployment even as Dillard’s Inc, which caters to a more affluent customer, posted better sales during the holiday quarter. Both Kohl’s and Target tried to protect margins as best they could during the holiday quarter by not slashing prices beyond a certain point, but that came at the cost of disappointing sales for both retailers. “We did see resistance from our customer,” Kohl’s Chief Executive Kevin Mansell told analysts on a conference call, referring to prices hikes put in the place to counteract higher product costs. That cost the company customers, leading to same-store sales falling 2.1 percent over the holiday quarter despite a stepped-up advertising campaign. Kohl’s may have little choice but to relent on those price hikes. “They absolutely have to stand out as the promotional department store that they are,” said Matt Arnold, an analyst with Edward Jones. Kohl’s said it expects same-store sales to be up 2 percent this year, while Macy’s on Tuesday forecast a 3.5 percent gain. It also said online sales passed $1 billion last year. But those sales came at the expense of those at its brick-and-mortar stores. As a result, it plans to slow the pace of new store openings and shift some of its capital expenditure to its online business. Kohl’s said it would earn $4.75 per share in fiscal 2012, below the $4.95 that Wall Street analysts were projecting. It Kohl’s forecast gross margin would fall 1.6 percentage points in the current quarter compared with a year ago Kohl’s shares were down 5.8 percent to $49.17 in afternoon trading, while Dillard’s were up 9.2 percent. Target shares were up 2.4 percent. Target got some relief from the growing popularity of its debit and credit cards that give shoppers a 5 percent discount. And after a tough holiday season, the discounter said sales trends are returning to normal. It expects same-store sales to be up 3 percent this year. The trendy discounter was largely able to contain the damage to its gross margin, which edged down 0.3 percentage point to 28.4 percent of sales, helped by more sales rung up through its credit and debit card rewards. The erosion to gross margin was more moderate than what analysts expected. Customers continued to respond to Target’s credit and debit cards. Target said 10.8 percent of sales were made using those cards, compared with 7.4 percent a year earlier, and it expects that percentage to rise again this year. “We expect U.S. momentum to improve following a disappointing holiday season,” said Bernstein Research analyst Colin McGranahan, noting that Target shares were undervalued. Target expects to earn between $4.05 and $4.25 per share this year, compared with analyst expectations of $4.27. But without costs associated to its expansion into Canada, with the first stores there set to open next year, earnings would be 50 cents per share higher. Target previously said fourth-quarter sales rose 3.3 percent to $20.94 billion.

158,TGT,"UPDATE 2-Target eyes $3 dividend by 2017, buybacks go on","* Says will maintain investment grade rating * Expects $1.5 billion in buybacks in 2012 March 19 (Reuters) - Target Corp said on Monday it expects its annual dividend to reach $3 per share or more by 2017, if it meets its profit goals, and plans to continue buying back shares even as it spends money to get ready for its Canadian launch next year. Target, which said it had completed a $10 billion share repurchase program from 2007, said in a statement it “continues to generate far more cash than we need to fund” its main business. The discount chain currently pays an annual dividend of $1.20 per share and is planning to open its first international stores in Canada in 2013. Target said it would spend about $1.5 billion on buying back shares this year, less than the $1.9 billion it spent in 2011. But the pace of the repurchases will pick up steam after the launch of its Canadian stores is complete and it has fewer capital expenses. Target said it would manage its share repurchases in a way that would keep its investment grade credit ratings. In January, Target’s board directors authorized a $5 billion buyback the retailer expects to complete within two to three years. Under the previous program, Target bought back 23 percent of the shares that were outstanding in November 2007, when it was authorized. The discount retailer has a goal of a profit per share of $8 by 2017.

165,TGT,Target to stop selling Amazon's Kindle devices,"(Reuters) - Target Corp said on Wednesday it will stop selling Amazon.com Inc’s Kindle devices, the latest in a series of brawls between the companies fueled by Amazon’s increasing competition with brick and mortar retailers. “Target is phasing out Amazon- and Kindle-branded products in the spring of 2012,” Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder wrote in an email to Reuters. “We will continue to offer our guests a full assortment of e-readers and supporting accessories.” The decision includes Amazon’s new Kindle Fire tablet, its range of Kindle e-readers and all accessories for the devices, including covers and chargers. Target will still sell other e-readers and tablets, including the Nook from Barnes & Noble, Snyder added. “This is evidence that Target is getting more serious about Amazon as an enemy rather than a partner,” said Matt Nemer, an analyst at Wells Fargo. Amazon ran Target’s website for several years, but that relationship ended last year amid a legal battle. “That’s probably something Target now regrets,” Nemer said. “It put them behind in the world of multi-channel retail and let a serious competitor learn a lot about their business.” Wal-Mart Stores, the world’s largest retailer, will keep selling Kindles, a spokeswoman said on Wednesday. An Amazon spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment. Target’s move comes as the retailer outfits some of its stores with special displays of Apple Inc products, including the iPad, which competes with Amazon’s Kindle Fire tablet. Amazon’s Kindle Fire is tightly integrated with the company’s huge online retail store, which competes with Target’s physical big-box outlets and its website. “Target is trying to distance themselves from Amazon as much as possible because they recognize they are losing sales to them,” said Scott Tilghman, an analyst at Caris & Co. Target is still selling the Nook because Barnes & Noble is mainly focused on selling books, which are not an important product category for Target, he added. In contrast, everything sold in a Target store, such as apparel, home goods and consumer products, is also offered by Amazon, Tilghman noted. “Nook is much less cannibalistic and Barnes & Noble is not going after Target’s business,” he said. Target’s Snyder said the company “continually evaluates its product assortment to deliver the best quality and prices for our guests.” She declined to comment on whether closer merchandising ties with Apple or broader competition with Amazon were behind the move to stop selling Kindles. Amazon shares were down 89 cents at $229.15 in Wednesday afternoon trading, while Target shares slipped 40 cents to $57.61. Target’s move is not a big problem for Amazon because other retailers are still selling Kindles, Tilghman said. On Wednesday afternoon, Best Buy Co and RadioShack Corp still listed Kindles for sale on their websites. Still, the spat with Target highlights that while Amazon seeks to work with retailers and provide the sector with e-commerce services, it also competes with those companies. “Amazon will continue to partner with retailers, but the focus will be on the e-commerce side,” Tilghman said. “For every Target, there are many smaller retailers that don’t have the deep pockets to build their own e-commerce business.” Tech blog The Verge reported Target’s decision to stop selling Kindles earlier on Wednesday.

169,TGT,UPDATE 2-Steven Madden's private label business hits margins,"* Q1 EPS $0.50, in line with estimates * Rev $266.0 mln vs est. $249.9 mln * Raises FY12 EPS view to $2.62-$2.72 * Expects FY12 sales to rise 24-26 pct * Shares fall as much as 6 pct By Ranjita Ganesan May 3 (Reuters) - Shoemaker Steven Madden Ltd’s  quarterly profit failed to surpass analysts’ expectations for the first time in more than two years, as the expansion of its private-label business continued to weigh on margins. Steven Madden — which has beat analysts’ estimates for the past nine quarters — has seen its margins decline as it shuffles its product mix and offers more private-label items, which typically carry lower margins. The company counts retailers including Target Corp  among its private-label customers. Last May, it bought Topline Corp and Cejon Inc, which make store-branded products that mostly sell at lower prices to name brands. Gross margins fell to 36.1 percent in the first quarter from 41.7 percent a year earlier. The company, which, according its website, was founded by designer Steve Madden in 1990 with just $1,100 in his bank account, is best known for its thick, chunky-heeled shoes. Shares of the company fell as much as 6 percent on Thursday even after it reported quarterly sales above estimates and raised its full-year forecast. C.L. King & Associates analyst Steven Marotta, however, reiterated his “buy” rating on the stock and said the new business model is effective and the company’s fundamentals are still strong. “It was a terrific quarter but it’s not reflected in the stock price because expectations might have been a little bit higher than what (Steven Madden) hit,” Marrotta said. First-quarter profit was $21.9 million, or 50 cents per share, in line with analyst expectations. Revenue rose about 60 percent to $266.0 million, handily beating Wall Street estimates of $249.9 million. Steven Madden also raised its 2012 earnings forecast by 2 cents to between $2.62 and $2.72 per share. Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $2.67 per share for the full year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Full-year sales are expected to grow in the range of 24 to 26 percent, compared with the company’s previous outlook of a 21 to 23 percent rise. Analysts were expecting revenue to rise about 22.9 percent. The company’s shares were down 2 percent at $43.31 on Thursday on the Nasdaq.",5032012,http://www.reuters.com/article/stevenmadden/update-2-steven-maddens-private-label-business-hits-margins-idUSL4E8G35XM20120503
170,TGT,Target raises profit forecast; shares inch up,"(Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) raised its annual earnings forecast after posting a bigger-than-expected rise in quarterly profit, even as it spends more on plans to open stores in Canada and has concerns about U.S. shoppers’ ability to spend. The discount chain expects economic uncertainty to continue for the rest of 2012, Chairman and Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel said on Wednesday. Shares of Target were up 31 cents to $55.39 in midday trading after rising as high as $56.44 earlier in the session. “Consumers are not buying more at Target. What’s driving their sales is maybe people are shopping a bit more often,” said Brian Sozzi, chief equities analyst at NBG Productions. “It’s not like people are going in and loading up their baskets as much as they were a couple of years ago.” Target said it expects sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, to rise about 3 percent this quarter and 3 percent or a little more for the full year. Last year same-store sales rose 3 percent. Target, which sells basic goods such as soap and paper towels along with limited-edition items from the likes of designer Jason Wu, has been seeing more customers shop using its credit cards, which offer a 5 percent discount and free online shipping. Some of the first-quarter strength came from an early Easter and warmer weather, which spurred sales of clothing and other items. Apparel had its best quarterly performance since 2006. The number of transactions at Target stores open at least a year rose 2 percent in the first quarter, while the number of items per transaction rose just 0.6 percent. Selling prices were 2.6 percent higher than a year ago. Target’s latest initiatives include opening its first CityTarget stores - smaller, urban-format stores - this summer. Along with such plans, Target is likely to benefit as J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) works on a makeover, said Consumer Edge Research analyst Faye Landes, who has an “outperform” rating and $63 price target on Target shares. Macy’s Inc (M.N) has already said it is benefiting as J.C. Penney loses sales while it works on a new retail strategy. Target has added a wider variety of food, including fresh produce, to more of its stores. Other chains, such as Dollar General Corp (DG.N) and Family Dollar Stores Inc FDO.N, are also attracting shoppers with more food items. Target earned $697 million, or $1.04 per share, in the first quarter that ended in April, up from $689 million, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, it said it earned $1.11 per share. Target is preparing to enter Canada in 2013 and said costs related to its first international expansion cut about 8 cents per share from first-quarter profit. In 2011, it spent about 17 cents per share on Canada. Excluding the Canada costs, the company earned $1.03 per share, topping analysts’ average forecast of $1.01, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company raised its fiscal-year profit view by 5 cents per share. It now expects adjusted earnings of $4.60 to $4.80 per share. For the second quarter, it anticipates adjusted earnings of $1.04 to $1.14 per share. Analysts expect Target to earn $4.28 per share this year and 99 cents per share in the second quarter. “They set the bar high, and the trends in their business, in my opinion, I don’t know if they support that,” Sozzi said. Target’s same-store sales rose 5.3 percent in the first quarter. While it was the strongest quarterly performance in more than six years, it fell short of analysts’ average forecast of 5.6 percent growth, according to Thomson Reuters. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Target vs Wal-Mart graphic: link.reuters.com/kef38s ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Target is growing faster than rival Walmart U.S., the largest unit of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N). Analysts expect Walmart U.S. to post a 1.4 percent rise in same-store sales when Wal-Mart issues its quarterly results on Thursday. Target’s overall first-quarter sales rose 6.1 percent to $16.54 billion. Total revenue, including credit-card revenue, rose 5.9 percent to $16.87 billion. Target said 11.6 percent of sales in its stores were paid for with its REDcard credit and debit cards. A year ago, only 7.6 percent of sales were paid for with the cards. The company is still committed to selling its credit card receivables portfolio, Steinhafel said during a conference call. Target still expects to hit $100 billion in annual sales and $8 in annual earnings per share by 2017, Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan said. Last year, sales were $68.47 billion and earnings were $4.28 per share. ",5162012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-target/target-raises-profit-forecast-shares-inch-up-idUSBRE84F0IZ20120516

Macquarie Research analyst Liz Dunn, who spoke with the company after the announcement, said Penney wanted to pursue a different approach to marketing. “I think they’ve decided to go in a different direction with the marketing and that was something that Michael Francis owned - the marketing piece of it,” she said. “Although the ads were beautiful and fun, they weren’t resonating.” Penney’s ads, many of which have featured comedienne Ellen DeGeneres, were faulted by many critics for not focusing on product and prices, and ultimately confusing consumers Francis was one of a number of executives hired away from Johnson’s alma maters Target and Apple, where Johnson had built a successful retail chain before leaving last year. Francis spent most of his career at Target.

178,TGT,UPDATE 1-Target's Canadian expansion gets Ottawa's OK,"* Target plans to open 125 to 135 stores in Canada * Target to sell Canadian books, other cultural products OTTAWA, July 6 (Reuters) - The federal government has given Target Corp the green light to open more than 100 stores in Canada after the U.S. discount chain promised to sell Canadian books and other cultural items, Heritage Minister James Moore said on Friday. Target plans to open 125 to 135 stores in Canada starting in March or April 2013, taking over store leases from Hudson’s Bay Co’s Zellers discount banner. Ottawa ordered a review of Target’s intentions in March to judge whether its move into Canada would be of net cultural benefit to the country. “Target has been granted approval ... to sell cultural products in its Canadian stores,” Moore said in a statement, saying the chain had promised more than C$3.5 billion ($3.4 billion) in capital investment. “Target’s new investment in Canada’s economy will create over 20,000 new jobs across the country and will include the commitment to sell uniquely Canadian cultural products in its Canadian stores.” Canada imposes provisions on Canadian cultural content in light of the U.S. dominance of the publishing and entertainment industries. Ottawa’s approval was based on commitments made by Target, which include: * employment of 100 to 200 people at each store * the availability and promotion of Canadian cultural products * the participation of Canadians in the business * Target’s support for Canadian cultural events and organizations.

July 10 (Reuters) - Discount retailer Target Corp  and luxury department store chain Neiman Marcus Group Inc  said on Tuesday they are teaming up to jointly sell a holiday collection featuring limited edition items by 24 top designers, as each retailer seeks to broaden its appeal to more customers. Target and Neiman will each sell 50 items by designers such as Tory Burch, Carolina Herrera and Marc Jacobs in their stores and on their respective websites beginning December 1. Prices will range from $7.99 to $499.99, though the majority of items will cost less than $60. Target has done partnerships with high-end names before, notably last year’s wildly popular Missoni collection.

Penney, Kohl’s and Macy’s July 17 (Reuters) - U.S. retailers face a challenging back-to-school season as consumers tighten their purse strings, Citi Investment Research said, downgrading Target Corp  by a notch to “neutral” and cutting its price targets on several stocks. The downgrade comes a day after a report by the U.S. Commerce Department that said retail sales fell in June for the third straight month. “Since we first introduced our ‘Empty Pockets’ theme ... the consumer environment has deteriorated further and ... sales trends have slowed for the broadlines retailers in July,” Citigroup analyst Deborah Weinswig wrote in a note to clients. According to Citi, in the ‘Empty Pockets’ landscape, consumers find ways to save on the necessities to stretch their discretionary budgets. “Consumers stick to buying the basics and competition from both pure play e-commerce and off-price players puts pressure on our retailers,” Weinswig wrote. Unsold inventories due to soft traffic and conversion trends in June and July will hurt second-quarter margins, said Weinswig, who is rated five stars by Thomson Reuters StarMine for the accuracy of her earnings estimates on companies. Retailers are experiencing trouble selling through clearance despite deeper discounts, she added. High unemployment and anxiety about the economy hurt top U.S. retailers’ sales in June with Costco Wholesale Corp , Macy’s Inc, Kohl’s Corp and Target posting disappointing sales for the month. Citi cut its price target on Target Corp to $68 from $69, on Kohl’s to $55 from $56 and on Macy’s to $37 from $38. Citi also removed J.C. Penney from its “top picks live! list” and cut its target price on the stock to $24 from $40. Shares of J.C. Penney closed at $19.58 on Monday, those of Kohl’s at $47.65 and Macy’s at $33.92.

HBC sold 189 Zellers leases to Target Corp in 2011. Target chose some spots for its own stores, and sold on or returned others to landlords. The U.S. retailer will open its first 125 Canadian stores in 2013. “Zellers is considering options for certain locations, including potentially rebranding some stores,” said spokeswoman Tiffany Bourre. “We haven’t determined which locations those will be, if any. Most will close.” The remaining Zellers stores are mostly in smaller markets across Canada, and employ about 6,400 people. Many stores under the banner, which competes with Wal-Mart Stores Inc, have become run down. Target plans to spend about $10 million renovating each outlet that it takes over. Closely-held HBC, North America’s oldest continually operating company, has been moving upscale in recent years. In Canada, at department store chain The Bay, it has been swapping out brands, pushing to improve customer service and hosting high-profile celebrity fashion events at remodeled downtown stores. In January, HBC completed its acquisition of upmarket U.S. department store chain Lord & Taylor and The Bay’s president, Bonnie Brooks, took charge of both chains. The Bay and Lord & Taylor had been operating as side-by-side affiliates since Richard Baker’s U.S.-based private equity group, NRDC Equity Partners, bought HBC in 2008.

186,TGT,Retailer Target taps demand for office-space makeovers,"* Target unit’s sales outpace business furniture industry * Clients include Chicago Cubs, healthcare companies, Target * Tiny unit benefits from pent-up demand to update space By Jessica Wohl Aug 9 (Reuters) - Across the street from Target Corp’s  Minneapolis headquarters sits a little-noticed office showroom that happens to house one of the retailer’s best-performing businesses. Target Commercial Interiors is a relatively unknown part of a company known for its bullseye logo and so-called cheap chic apparel. Still, it is significant enough to merit a mention in Target’s annual report and, even more, offers a glimpse into how U.S. companies have started to spend more to freshen their digs. After recovering from an industry downturn, when the great recession pushed companies to reduce spending, sales growth at Target Commercial far outpaces that of Target itself. The business projects a strong 2012. The Fortune 250 “is starting to spend a little more capital,” though “cost is prevalent among most conversations,” said Jamie Lowe, senior vice president of strategic alliances. Companies are updating offices that were ignored in recent years, replacing high-walled cubicles with long tables and benches where workers collaborate. Such changes give offices a makeover and can help attract new talent. “As more and more of the Gen Y-ers and younger employees come into the workplace, they don’t care so much about the corner office or dedicated workspace,” said Target Commercial Interiors General Manager Mike Litwin. Back in 2009, the U.S. office furniture market slumped, with sales plummeting 29 percent to $9.23 billion after a 3.2 percent decline in 2008, according to the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer’s Association. Target Commercial’s own sales fell 35 percent in 2009 and were flat in 2010, Litwin said. Sales then rose 16 percent in 2011, eclipsing Target’s overall revenue growth of 3.7 percent and the 12.7 percent growth in the U.S. office furniture market. This year started out strong as well, executives said. “Our first-half sales were substantially beyond what first-half sales have been in 2011 or 2010,” said Litwin, who predicts that sales could rise by 12 to 20 percent in 2012. Such growth, which includes international projects, would far outpace the 4.8 percent sales increase expected in the overall U.S. office furniture market. Still, Target Commercial’s undisclosed revenue is unlikely to gain much attention for Target overall, where annual sales approach $70 billion. The unit has roughly 160 employees, while each of Target’s 1,772 stores employs an average of 200 workers. “It’s not a needle-mover by any stretch,” said Barclays analyst Robert Drbul. “I don’t get the sense that they spend that much time from an executive level focusing on it.” Target Commercial executives say they operate largely on their own, though they are connected “very tightly” with Target on financial measures. The unit, a major seller of Steelcase  furniture, competes against companies such as OfficeScapes, One Workplace, Red Thread and Tangram. One of Target Commercial’s recent projects was to help turn a warehouse and parking garage into office space for more than 125 employees of the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball team. Before the move in March, staff worked in about 10 locations in and near Wrigley Field, including in trailers in the parking lot. Even those who worked inside Wrigley did not have upscale work spaces. Wally Hayward, the team’s chief sales and marketing officer, said his office sat in what used to be a women’s restroom. Employees could often hear beer kegs rolling overhead. Now, the Cubs staff works up the street from Wrigley Field in a nondescript, low brick building. Sports Illustrated magazine covers featuring the Cubs hang on the wall and the boardroom table features baseball stitched panels. Other clients include General Mills Inc, Marriott International Inc, and universities such as Arizona State. Target hires Target Commercial to furnish its offices and helps it with areas such as procurement and human resources. Being associated with the retailer can be an advantage when pitching new business. “It does help open doors,” said Litwin.",8092012,http://www.reuters.com/article/target-furniture/retailer-target-taps-demand-for-office-space-makeovers-idUSL2E8J87KQ20120809
187,TGT,Target beats expectations; shares rise,"(Reuters) - Target Corp posted higher-than-expected quarterly earnings and raised its full-year forecast as it won over shoppers with an expanded selection of food in many stores and discounts for its cardholders without sacrificing its profit margins. Shares of the U.S. discount chain rose 1.8 percent to $64.51 in Wednesday morning trading. Target has been opening smaller city stores and using other tactics to entice shoppers to visit more often. The company will also sell a line of holiday goods with upscale department store Neiman Marcus Group Inc later this year. “They are very well positioned,” said Shawn Kravetz, president of Esplanade Capital LLC, which has owned Target shares for a little more than a year. “They do have a slightly more discretionary mix than say a Walmart,” Kravetz said. “As the American consumer spends, which they appear to be continuing to do, they will incrementally be a beneficiary of that.” Wal-Mart Stores Inc, which gets the bulk of its sales and profits from its huge U.S. unit, is set to report its results on Thursday. Sales at Walmart U.S. have been rising, but the growth still trails the gains at Target, whose shoppers typically have more discretionary income to spend. At Target, adding more food to the stores and offering a 5 percent discount to cardholders attracted shoppers but also weighed on profits. Gross margin declined slightly to 31.3 percent in the second quarter ended on July 28 from 31.6 percent a year earlier. Target needs to “delicately balance” its food and REDcard initiatives with the rest of its plans “in order to maintain reasonable gross margin and not let that slip too much further,” said Sandy Skrovan, U.S. research director for Planet Retail. Target said it was “very pleased” with the early results from its first three CityTargets, which opened in Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle in late July. The stores are about two-thirds of the size of the company’s typical locations and carry a limited selection of some goods. Analysts see CityTarget as a blueprint for how Target plans to run stores in Canada, where its sites are smaller than its typical U.S. shops. Target plans to start opening Canadian stores in March or April, after taking over leases for Zellers stores from Hudson’s Bay Co in 2011. “The success of this format will essentially depend on whether Target can make the economics of the model work,” Stewart Samuel, a Vancouver, Canada-based senior analyst with food and grocery research firm IGD, said earlier this week. Occupancy and operational costs are likely to be higher at CityTarget than at Target stores, he said, while customers’ average spending per visit will be lower. The company’s profit was unchanged at $704 million in the second quarter, while earnings per share rose to $1.06 from $1.03 a year earlier, when there was more outstanding stock. The profit topped the analysts’ average forecast of $1.01, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said costs for the Canada entry had trimmed earnings by about 9 cents per share. Those expenses were a bit lower than anticipated, and the results benefited from that as well as higher-than-expected profitability in the credit card unit, said Janney analyst David Strasser, who has a “neutral” rating on Target stock. The percentage of sales paid for with Target’s REDcard credit and debit cards rose to 12.8 percent from 8.7 percent a year earlier. Target forecast third-quarter earnings per share of 69 cents to 79 cents. Analysts expect it to earn 76 cents. For the year, Target now expects to earn $4.20 to $4.40 per share, up from its May forecast of $4.10 to $4.30. Analysts are calling for a profit of $4.31 per share. As previously reported, sales in the quarter rose 3.5 percent to $16.45 billion, while sales at stores open at least a year increased 3.1 percent. Wal-Mart forecast in May that sales at its Walmart U.S. stores open at least a year would rise 1 percent to 3 percent in the second quarter.

194,TGT,"Target bets on QR codes, exclusive toys this holiday","(Reuters) - Target Corp hopes that letting shoppers scan, buy and ship a selection of toys while shopping in its stores and having hundreds of exclusive toys will help drive sales this holiday season, one of its executives told Reuters. Starting October 14, Target will feature 20 toys at the front of its aisles promoted with signs featuring QR codes. Shoppers with smart phones can scan the codes, those squares with dark boxes and lines, to buy any of those items and have them shipped free. “Providing this convenience for mom is about ensuring that she’s able to shop the way that she wants to,” said Stephanie Lucy, Target’s vice president of toys and the mother of two who knows about not wanting to ruin the surprise of the holidays. Giving shoppers this new way to buy merchandise could help differentiate Target from its rivals including: Toys R Us, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Amazon.com Inc. The holiday season accounts for the bulk of toy sales at Target and other U.S. chains. Last year, Target’s toy sales were hurt by Walmart’s layaway push before Thanksgiving. Unlike some other major toy sellers, Target does not offer layaway, which gives shoppers the ability to put goods on hold and pay over time. Instead, Target uses sales coupons, and free shipping and small discounts for its credit-card holders. Target’s fourth-quarter sales rose 3.3 percent last year, with sales at stores open at least a year up 2.2 percent, down from a 2.4 percent rise during the year-earlier holiday season. The company has not yet given a forecast for the holiday season, and Lucy declined to give a projection for toy sales. Lucy said on Tuesday the top trends this season include: construction toys such as Lego; interactive toys such as Hasbro Inc’s Furby and Just Play’s Bounce Bounce Tigger; and educational toys led by LeapPad 2. LeapPad 2, a kids’ tablet from LeapFrog Enterprises Inc, is on several hot holiday toy lists that retailers and industry groups assemble. To try to stand out, Target has an exclusive $130 LeapPad 2 bundle that includes playlists, a music video collection from Kidz Bop, known for popular music sung by kids, headphones and accessories that are valued at $199. The chain also sells the regular LeapPad 2 for $99. Along with the LeapPad 2 bundle, two of Target’s other top toys - Lego Friends Emma’s horse trailer and Mattel Inc’s Monster High Scary Tales Doll - are exclusive items for the Minneapolis chain. Target has more than 300 exclusive toys this year, roughly the same amount as last year. The chain sells about 10,000 toys online and has roughly 2,500 in stores, Lucy said. “Any retailer whose point of difference isn’t based on having the lowest pricing every day lives and dies by exclusivity,” Dan Cooney, vice president of sales at JAKKS Pacific Inc, said last week. “They need a marketable point of difference that they can compete with other than price.” Mattel works closely with large retailers such as Target, Toys R Us, Walmart and Amazon to identify opportunities to make their products stand out, Tim Kilpin, an executive vice president at Mattel, said last week. “It differs by retailer, but we try to be connected to what they think is going to work best for them,” Kilpin said. “It’s going to be something that they can really behind, that they can really promote so they can explain to their guests why it means more to go there versus others.” Lego also makes exclusive toys for Target, Walmart and Toys R Us, and has done that for some time. Fifteen of the 20 toys on Target’s list are priced below $50 as the chain recognizes that customers want value, said Lucy. “We believe we’re poised to have a strong holiday season,” she said.

196,TGT,"Home Depot, Target could see CDS reverse course","Oct 11 (IFR) - The CDS of big box retailers Home Depot and Target have tightened significantly in recent months, but have the potential to widen in the months ahead as consumer spending is expected to increase only moderately. The US Fed’s Beige Book on Wednesday cited flat consumer spending growth in September, and with a weak holiday shopping season expected, the two retail giants could see their credit default swaps reverse course. Home Depot (A3/A-/A-) and Target Corp  (A2/A+/A-) are both quality names from a credit perspective, with solid balance sheets, stable earnings growth and good customer loyalty. Market sentiment has helped tighten the credit default swaps of Home Depot to 42bp from 52bp in July, while Target’s CDS has tightened to 38bp from 41bp over the same period. Their CDS trade at tight levels relative to other investment-grade names, and are usually resistant to outside factors that provoke spread widening in lesser-rated entities. But despite the solid fundamentals, that outperformance is likely to fade. Moderate CDS widening can be expected if consumer spending continues to advance at a lackluster pace. There are plenty of other problems, too, including the looming fiscal cliff, elevated unemployment, stagnant wages and rising food and gasoline prices. With that as a backdrop, retailers such as Home Depot and Target have adopted a more guarded outlook in the near term - and September same store sales data back up those concerns. If we extrapolate from the self-published figures of a mix of big box, specialty and other retailers, we can get insight into how consumers feel about spending - and sense what to expect in the months ahead. Target’s September store sales came in at 2.1%, as expected, but compare to 5.3% last year. It does, however, place them on track to meet conservative goals. For October, Target forecasts low to mid single digit same store revenue growth. But the retailer had already planned for a stronger first half of 2012 versus the second half, and its CFO John Mulligan said at an analyst presentation last month that he expects “uncertainty” due to the fiscal cliff and presidential election, which is causing consumers to be cautious. At the same presentation, Home Depot CEO Frank Blake noted the tentative nature of consumers who are strapped for cash and less likely to invest in larger home remodeling projects. Even as the nascent housing recovery looks to gain traction, Blake said that many people were still “underwater on their homes,” and less likely to “put money into it and think you’ll get a return.” With expectations for comparable store sales growth in the low single digits, Home Depot has remained conservative in its opinion of the slow economic and housing recovery - and is linking its future growth to the GDP instead. With shoppers already cash-constrained, forecasts for the upcoming holiday season are less than enthusiastic. The National Retail Federation said last week that 2012 holiday sales will rise by an anemic 4.1% year on year, while the International Council of Shopping Centers has put it even lower at 3.0%. Ratings agency Moody’s also anticipates a lackluster holiday season, and expects Q4 sales will grow at their slowest pace since 2009 when, according to their data, the figure was a paltry 0.815%. The agency cites the slow increase of non-wage income as rising prices outpace wages - and as consumers become more reluctant to take on debt. That reluctance to take on debt will curb spending habits, whether holiday or home project-related, and warrants the cautionary outlook from retailers. This will eventually be reflected in the CDS of Home Depot and Target, in the form of widening spreads. And that widening could be spurred on further if consumer spending continues to be restrained.

For the first time, Target will let customers match prices from online retailers, including Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Walmart.com (WMT.N), BestBuy.com (BBY.N), Toysrus.com TOY.UL and Babiesrus.com between November 1 and December 16, the company told reporters at a meeting in New York. Target had previously matched printed advertisements for prices at competitors’ stores, and will still match those prices through December 24. Target’s strategy includes being “highly promotional” and “intensely competitive” on price on items carried by other retailers, while also featuring exclusive merchandise, Steinhafel said. Like many retailers, Target’s holiday season plans include an aggressive push around Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving that traditionally has served as the start of the holiday shopping season. Target did not say what time its stores will open on Black Friday, but it does plan to give out details early on its special prices, said Chief Marketing Officer Jeff Jones. Commercials for the holiday season include phrases such as “Dream big, save bigger” and “It’s On.” Steinhafel also said he is confident Target will meet its financial goals for the year, even though consumer confidence, while rising, remains largely below where it was before the devastating 2007-2009 recession. Last week, Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s preliminary October reading showed consumer sentiment at its highest level in five years. Like its rivals, Target is taking nothing for granted this holiday season. Earlier this month, Toys R Us said it would offer price matching at its namesake and Babies R Us stores. Target and upscale department store Neiman Marcus Group Inc NMRCUS.UL will sell a joint line of holiday goods, starting on December 1 during what is often a lull for retailers between Black Friday and the last couple of weeks before Christmas. The items range from dark gray wrapping paper designed by Rodarte, priced at $7.99 per roll, to a $499.99 floral-and-white bicycle with a neon green seat from Alice + Olivia. Neiman Marcus CEO Karen Katz said one of the items she plans to buy is a $69.99 metallic pouch from Marc Jacobs. In order to avoid the out-of-stock and online ordering glitches that overwhelmed Target during the run on Missoni products in 2011, Target and Neiman Marcus are allowing shoppers to buy only up to five of the same item per transaction. All returns must be made by January 5, 2013. The companies also said that they are sponsoring the November 11 episode of the popular ABC Sunday night show “Revenge” and incorporating products into the episode. Target will also give its REDcard credit and debit card holders an extra 30 days to return nearly all purchases made with the cards. Even though Target stopped selling Amazon.com Inc’s Kindle ereaders earlier this year, it is not concerned about other partnerships with companies that are also sometimes rivals, said Casey Carl, president of multichannel and senior vice president of marketing. Target started testing same-day delivery through Ebay Now in the San Francisco Bay Area market on October 10 and now sells a limited number items, both national branded goods and items only sold through Target, on eBay’s (EBAY.O) marketplace section of its site. But despite the popularity of layaway at other chains, including rival Wal-Mart, Target’s shoppers have not asked for layaway - the option of putting an item on hold and paying for it over time, Steinhafel said. Beyond its Christmas period initiatives, Target has been adding a wider variety of food to more locations, opening smaller city stores and offering a 5 percent discount to its card holders to entice shoppers to visit more often.

205,TGT,TEXT-Fitch: TD Acquisition of Target's U.S. Credit Card Portfolio Ratings Neutral,"NEW YORK, October 23 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings views Toronto-Dominion’s (TD, ‘AA-/F1+’) announced agreement to purchase Target Corporation’s (Target) U.S. credit card portfolio as neutral to TD’s ratings. In Fitch’s view, the transaction is consistent with the bank’s expansion strategy in the U.S. and offers TD exposure to the customer base of a well-established U.S. retailer. The acquisition is also viewed as manageable relative to TD’s overall capital base and banking franchise. Under the terms of the agreement, TD will acquire Target’s existing U.S. Visa and private label credit portfolio with outstanding balances of approximately $5.9 billion. Over the past few years, TD has built a solid presence and a large deposit franchise in the U.S. through several acquisitions. Today, TD owns TD Bank, NA with branches from Maine to Florida. While relatively small in the context of TD’s operations, the transaction is in line with TD’s focus on growing assets in the U.S. Further, it allows TD to redeploy its cost-effective core deposits into assets with a comparatively higher risk-return profile. This in turn should help TD, albeit modestly, achieve its goal of generating $1.6 billion adjusted earnings from its U.S. personal and commercial segment in 2013. Additionally, TD has entered a seven-year program agreement to become the exclusive issuer of Target-branded Visa and private label credit cards to Target’s U.S. customers going forward. Under the terms of the program agreement, TD and Target will share the net profits generated by the credit card receivables, with Target having the greater proportion. TD will provide funding, risk management policies, and regulatory compliance for the portfolios while Target will handle all elements of operations and customer service. Target’s credit card portfolio appears to have experienced comparatively elevated credit losses in prior periods. This is partly mitigated by higher yields relative to TD’s own credit card receivables. The profit sharing agreement also provides TD with some cushion against outsized credit costs. The transaction may bring some execution risks associated with the shared responsibilities for the portfolios. The transaction is anticipated to close in 1H’13 subject to customary regulatory approvals. The acquisition is expected to produce a return on assets of approximately 1% a year after closing, according to TD. Credit card receivables will be consolidated on TD’s balance sheet from closing onwards. The transaction is expected to reduce Tier 1 capital ratio (Basel II) by approximately 20 bps and Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio by approximately 14 bps at closing, on a pro forma basis as of 3Q’12.",10232012,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-ratings-target/text-fitch-td-acquisition-of-targets-u-s-credit-card-portfolio-ratings-neutral-idUSWNA826120121023

208,TGT,Target to sell credit card portfolio to TD Bank,"(Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) agreed to sell its credit card portfolio to Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO)(TD.N), nearly two years after the U.S. discount retailer said it wanted to unload the business. TD will pay an amount equal to the gross value of the outstanding receivables - most recently valued at $5.9 billion - when the deal closes, and signed a 7-year agreement to be the exclusive issuer of Target-branded Visa and private-label cards in the United States. The deal gives Toronto-based TD, the sixth-largest bank in North America, a way to expand its credit card portfolio and allows Target to cut debt as it expands retail operations, including its first foray into Canada, planned for early next year. Target’s credit card business has been growing as the chain offers 5 percent discounts for users of the so-called REDcard and free shipping for online orders. In the second quarter, the percentage of sales in Target stores paid with Target’s REDcard credit and debit cards rose to 12.8 percent from 8.7 percent a year earlier. “This is a pretty high-quality portfolio,” said Tom Lewandowski, a St. Louis-based banking analyst at Edward Jones. Canada’s banks escaped the 2008 financial crisis in relatively strong shape and have been seeking foreign-owned assets to offset meager growth prospects in their home market. Separately, TD’s larger rival Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) said on Tuesday it agreed to buy the Canadian auto finance and deposit arm of Ally Financial was also involved in the bidding for Ally, a source told Reuters. Under terms of the deal, Target, the No. 2 U.S. discounter after Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), will keep earning a substantial portion of profits generated by its credit card and Visa portfolios. Minneapolis-based Target said third-quarter earnings will reflect a pretax gain of about $150 million as it changes the accounting treatment of its receivables from “held for investment” to “held for sale.” It expects to recognize an additional pretax gain of $350 million to $450 million when the deal closes. The deal, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be completed during the first half of 2013. TD shares dropped 1.3 percent at C$81.86, in line with other Toronto-listed financials, while Target added 0.7 percent to $62.66 in New York trading. TD said in a statement the deal would help achieve an adjusted earnings target of $1.6 billion from its U.S. retail segment in 2013. The unit earned $355 million in the fiscal third quarter. Analysts said the deal fits the bank’s strategy of making small acquisitions to bulk up its 1,300-branch U.S. retail bank and provide an outlet for deposits it has accumulated since entering the U.S. market eight years ago. “There’s not a ton of things to do with those deposits, and so this is very much in keeping with that kind of a strategy,” said CIBC World Markets analyst Robert Sedran. Last year, TD acquired the credit card portfolio of MBNA Canada - one of the largest MasterCard issuers in Canada - from Bank of America Corp (BAC.N). Target Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel said last week the company expected to find the right buyer for the credit card business by the end of the year. The company first said it wanted to sell its receivables portfolio in January 2011, then put the plans on hold in January 2012, saying it would restart talks after paying off financing it had with JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM.N). Target plans to use about 90 percent of the proceeds from the deal to reduce its net debt position, and the rest to repurchase its shares over time. Target said adjusted earnings per share will be about 10 cents lower in the first year after the deal closes than they would have been if Target kept funding the portfolio - due to the combination of the profit-sharing arrangement, debt reduction and share repurchases. Over time, Target expects that the deal will be neutral to adjusted earnings per share.

213,TGT,UPDATE 1-Australia's Wesfarmers says Coles Q1 sales up 3.7 pct,"* Coles sees price deflation moderating as fruit, vegetable prices rise * Coles head says consumer sentiment still down vs year ago * Bunnings Q1 same-store sales up 2.5 pct, Target down 4.1 pct   (Adds details, quotes) MELBOURNE, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Australia’s Wesfarmers Ltd  said like-for-like sales at its Coles supermarkets grew 3.7 percent in its fiscal first quarter as a long-running price war enticed cost-conscious shoppers and boosted sales volumes. That beat average market forecasts for 3.4 percent growth, according to a Reuters survey of six analysts, and compared with growth of 2.3 percent at top rival Woolworths Ltd. Australian retailers in general have been forced to deeply discount and accept shrunken profit margins as consumers respond to economic uncertainty and falling home and share market values by freezing spending. “Our customers are as focused on value now as they have ever been, with consumer sentiment still slow to recover to levels seen last year,” said Coles Managing Director Ian McLeod. The retail-to-coal company said food-and-liquor price deflation was 3.2 percent in the first quarter, driven by a price war as Coles competes with Woolworths. Both chains, which control over 70 percent of the grocery market, have slashed the cost of basic items such as food, milk and meat to win foot traffic. Coles, which has now had food and liquor price deflation for 12 of the last 13 quarters, said a rise in fresh produce prices would slow price deflation through the course of the year. First-quarter sales at Wesfarmers’ home improvement chain Bunnings rose 2.5 percent at stores open more than a year, while discounter Target saw same-store sales fall 4.1 percent as it reduced the price of toys. Discounter Kmart had a 2.2 percent increase in sales. “We like the effort in Coles but think the turnaround in Target is taking too long,” said Peter Esho, analyst at Citi Index. “We think the share price will struggle to maintain a rally above A$35 per share until the other pieces of the pie fall into place.” The stock closed Wednesday at A$34.60, off a March low of A$28.25. In its coal business, Wesfarmers agreed an average 26 percent drop in prices for its metallurgical coal exports as a slowdown in demand from Asian buyers bites.

214,TGT,UPDATE 2-Catamaran raises profit forecast on Catalyst buy,"* Now sees full-year adjusted profit of $1.09-$1.13/share * Signs 3-year PBM contract with Target * Q3 adj EPS $0.25 vs $0.22 year earlier * Catamaran shares rose as much as 9 pct Nov 1 (Reuters) - Pharmacy benefit manager Catamaran Corp   raised its earnings forecast for the year betting that it will benefit from the U.S. healthcare reform through its $4.4 billion acquisition of rival Catalyst Health Solutions. Catamaran, formerly known as SXC Health Solutions, said third-quarter revenue more than doubled to $3.2 billion as it added new customers and integrated the existing customers of Catalyst and HealthTran LLC, a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) it bought earlier this year. Catamaran shares rose 9 percent to C$51.18 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, pushing the benchmark S&P;/TSX composite index  higher on Thursday. Catamaran shares have risen 64 percent so far this year. PBMs administer health plans and drug benefits for employers and run mail-order pharmacies. They help cut costs of medication by encouraging more use of generic drugs. The PBM sector is expected to gain from the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, as the most sweeping overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system since the 1960s is expected to provide health insurance for an additional 30 million people. Catamaran has signed a three-year PBM contract with U.S. discount retailer Target Corp, Chief Executive Mark Thierer said on a conference call with analysts, adding that the contract will go live on April 1, 2013. Target, the No. 2 U.S. discounter after Wal-Mart Stores Inc , had about 365,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees as on Jan. 28. “The fact that they have got the PBM contract with Target supports the thesis that the company is now better positioned to win large employer contracts, which had historically been the sweet spot for some traditional PBMs like CVS Caremark Corp ,” analyst Gabriel Leung of Paradigm Capital said. Leung said Catamaran will now be able to go after larger employer groups. “As a combined company we are going to see some much larger deals and possible quicker pace of deal close as well,” he added. Catamaran raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast to between $1.09 and $1.13 per share, from its earlier expected range of $1.07 to $1.09 per share. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $1.09 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to the company fell 19 percent to $20.5 million, or 10 cents per share, in the third quarter, due to higher interest expenses, partly because of loans taken to finance the Catalyst deal, the company said. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 25 cents per share, slightly above analysts’ estimates of 24 cents.",11012012,http://www.reuters.com/article/catamaran-results/update-2-catamaran-raises-profit-forecast-on-catalyst-buy-idUSL3E8M14T920121101

216,TGT,Target to showcase CNET reviews as it courts gadget shoppers,"(Reuters) - Target Corp is bringing reviews from tech news website CNET into its aisles in time for the holiday season as it tries to stand out from a crowd of stores and websites selling a mix of new gadgets. The partnership between the discount chain and CNET, a website popular with gadget enthusiasts and known for its consumer electronics reviews, kicks off this week after a small test this spring showed that Target’s shoppers appreciated getting third-party reviews in stores. Shoppers will see reviews of 28 products in Target stores and reviews of 300 products on Target’s website. In stores, televisions on display will also occasionally show videos featuring CNET Editors’ Picks for Target and how-to videos. The partnership marks a bit of a shift for CNET, whose reviews are sometimes syndicated to places such as retailers’ websites but until now were not on store shelves. “The goal of this is to really make purchase decisions easier during the holidays because this is the time when a lot of people may not be purchasing for themselves,” said Lindsey Turrentine, editor-in-chief of CNET Reviews. A survey released this week by BDO USA found that 62 percent of retail chief marketing officers said consumer electronics would be the strongest selling category this holiday season. The same amount, 62 percent, said that the category would see the most discounts and promotions during the holiday season, BDO, the assurance, tax and financial consulting firm, said. A wide variety of products are hitting stores in time for the busy holiday season, including updated Apple Inc iPads, iPhone and iPods, the new iPad mini, Nintendo’s Wii U, Microsoft Corp’s Windows 8 software and Surface tablets, Google Inc’s Nexus tablets and new Samsung tablets and phones. However, the growing practice of using stores to look at items and then buy them at lower prices elsewhere, known as showrooming, has added pressure to stores. “If you don’t really know what you want, (and) you want the broadest selection, then you go to an electronics store,” said Stephen Baker, vice president of industry analysis for NPD Group. “If you have a better idea about what you want and you’ve narrowed it down then you probably have some more choices in terms of what type of store you want to go to.” For Target, which says that it edits the selection of goods to help make decisions easier for its shoppers, offering reviews may help seal the deal in the stores or push shoppers scanning QR codes to its website, where more reviews will be available. In May, Target tested putting CNET reviews near a handful of items such as cameras and televisions, and shoppers “definitely valued having not only a consumer review but the expert review as well,” Scott Nygaard, Target’s vice president of electronics, said. Now, 28 items - ranging in price from $19.99 to $1,399.99 - will be highlighted with 5-star reviews that CNET writes. Selections were made based on the products’ ease of use, style and value, CNET and Target said. The products selected include cameras from Samsung, Nikon, Fujifilm and Canon. Barnes & Noble Inc’s Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight was chosen as the best e-reader for reading in the dark, while Apple’s iPad was named the best tablet. Nintendo’s DSi was picked as the best gaming system for under $100 and Sony’s PS3 was named the best all-in-one gaming and entertainment system. “We’ve got an edited assortment already that we think helps simplify and we’re hoping this is just a way for the guest to save time, money and have some research done for them, especially at holiday time where we know they’re already doing additional research from a review standpoint,” said Nygaard. Target will also get some added exposure, as its weekly circular promotions will be featured in Marketplace section of CNET.com. Manufacturers are aware of the partnership between Target and CNET but had no input on the reviews, Nygaard said. The holiday quarter is the biggest time of year for Target’s electronics sales. Sales of hardlines, which include everything from videogames to gadgets and toys, accounted for 19 percent of Target’s sales in 2011, down from 20 percent in 2010 and 22 percent in 2009.

218,TGT,Analysis: Hudson's Bay faces tough sell as it prepares for IPO,"TORONTO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - If Hudson’s Bay Co wants to provide some measure of comfort to investors in its upcoming initial public offering, it might have to throw in some of its signature striped wool blankets. The retailer, owner of two of the most venerable names in department stores - Hudson’s Bay in Canada and Lord & Taylor in the United States - faces a big challenge in convincing investors it can win the turnaround game, especially with a hip and agile competitor like Target Corp (TGT.N) about to arrive in Canada. As HBC prepares for its C$400 million ($399 million) initial public offering in Toronto, it is touting a “transformation” that includes rising sales at established stores, a figure investors watch closely. But both chains face increasing competition, a likely medium- and long-run negative for the stock. The department store sector has grown slowly as shoppers look online or seek out discount stores. In the United States, Lord & Taylor competes with a resurgent Macy’s Inc (M.N), and in Canada, HBC faces competition from Target and other U.S. companies intent on shaking up the retail landscape. “I think an investor in the Bay would be well-advised to wait until Target has entered the market and they have some insight as to what the business climate will be for the Bay on a real basis, not on a speculative basis,” said Mark Cohen, former chief executive of Sears Canada Inc SCC.TO and now a professor of marketing at Columbia University in New York. HBC says its transformation is a work in progress, with more upside to come. “The focus will be the opportunity to close the margin gap, the opportunity to grow same-store sales,” said Walter Stackow, analyst with Manning & Napier, which invests in retail stocks. HBC has estimated it will sell up to 19 percent of the company in the IPO at between C$18.50 and C$21.50 per share, giving it a market value of C$2.4 billion, according to a fund manager who has reviewed the firm’s sale documents. The company is braving an otherwise stalled IPO market in Canada. A recent PwC survey counted three issues on the Toronto Stock Exchange in the first nine months of 2012, down from 14 in the same period last year. HBC says it will use the proceeds to pay down debt, although it will remain heavily indebted - as of July 28, total short- and long-term debt came to C$1.37 billion. Ryan Bushell, a portfolio manager with Leon Frazer & Associates in Toronto who manages the IA Clarington Canadian Conservative Equity Fund, said he was briefed on the IPO but is staying on the sidelines for now. “We wouldn’t be stepping into more consumer sensitive names right at this moment,” he said. “We’d rather see how the market digests this IPO and see a few quarters of execution as a public company.” HBC declined to comment for this piece. Founded in 1670, Hudson’s Bay was a fur trading business long before it operated department stores, having been granted control of a significant part of what is now Canada by King Charles II. It went private in 2006, as shoppers fled to specialty retailers and U.S.-based heavyweights like Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N). NRDC Equity Partners, controlled by U.S. real estate investor Richard Baker and his family, bought out HBC’s other investors in 2008, and integrated it with Lord & Taylor, which operates 48 stores across the United States. A recent study by consultancy Kantar Retail singled out Hudson’s Bay’s 90 outlets as particularly vulnerable to Target. Early HBC investors will have little chance to gauge the impact of Target’s 2013 arrival in Canada before buying in. “I wouldn’t touch it (the IPO) with a 10-foot pole,” said Barry Schwartz, vice president and portfolio manager at Toronto’s Baskin Financial Services. “I think it’s an opportunistic idea to take advantage of a pretty good market and the fact that Target hasn’t made any impact yet.” With a presence primarily in the U.S. northeast, Lord & Taylor is small relative to its publicly traded peers. It had sales of C$1.4 billion last year, or roughly three weeks of revenue at Macy’s, which sold Lord & Taylor off in 2006. Hudson’s Bay had sales of C$2.2 billion. HBC has focused on its two marquee banners, winding down discount chains Fields and Zellers, and selling many of its Zellers leases to Target in a C$1.83 billion deal. Home Outfitters, HBC’s 69-outlet Canadian housewares chain, is not much mentioned in the prospectus. Columbia University’s Cohen said the remaining Zellers locations may prove costly to liquidate, and Hudson’s Bay just doesn’t have a strong market position. High-end Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N), legendary in the United States for its customer service, will start rolling out its namesake department stores and lower-priced Rack outlets in Canada in 2014. Even Canadian luxury retailer Holt Renfrew is launching a new lower-priced banner. For its part, Lord & Taylor must take on Macy’s, Nordstrom and Saks Inc SKS.N, all of which are expanding their outlet chains. Macy’s is spending $400 million on its Manhattan flagship, while Kohl’s and Nordstrom are opening new stores. Last year, Lord & Taylor spent C$91 million to improve its stores, including a facelift at its Manhattan flagship. Industry experts say the chain, founded in 1826, let its high-end aura erode over the years, relying too much on discounts. It has ramped up offerings by U.S. designers like Elie Tahari, and shows the biggest image improvement among shoppers in the last 13 months, according to market research firm YouGov. But it still lags Macy’s and Nordstrom. “Lord & Taylor has a very loyal customer base,” said retail industry veteran Walter Loeb, who earlier in his career was a senior merchant at Macy’s and analyst at Morgan Stanley. “But they have to build a new customer base.” Another potential problem for HBC is lagging e-commerce. Last year, it got 2.1 percent of sales online, compared with 8 percent to 15 percent for the publicly traded U.S. department stores. Selling, general and administrative costs in relation to sales have improved in recent years, thanks in part to efficiencies from combining some of the two chains’ operations. At 35 percent of sales last year, the costs are lower than those of Sears stores in Canada, with 38 percent, but far above most of HBC’s peer group. They were 22.6 percent at Kohl’s and 26.7 percent at Nordstrom. HBC’s real estate, including historic buildings in major cities like New York and Toronto, could provide some floor to the stock’s value, should its turnaround stumble. The company owns or ground leases more than 11 million square feet of retail space, and has long-term, low-cost leases for another 14 million. HBC sales rose 6.4 percent from 2009 to 2011, and operating income jumped more than 17-fold as the retailer boosted store productivity and margins, but that growth could falter. “At the end of the day, the department store category is not a fast growing category,” Manning & Napier’s Stackow said.

219,TGT,Target profit beats expectations as store card draws shoppers,"(Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) on Thursday said it expects more shoppers this holiday season to adopt its store credit and debit cards, a key tool that draws customers to the discount chain’s stores and helped it report a bigger than expected third-quarter profit. Target said 14 percent of sales during the third quarter were paid for with its debit and credit cards, compared with 9.5 percent a year earlier. The cards offer a 5 percent discount to foster customer loyalty. “The RedCard is really a way to differentiate themselves and a way to push growth,” said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough. The retailer forecasts that the percentage of sales made through the card would again increase this quarter, by 4 points compared to a year earlier, and sees more room left for growth. A Target executive pointed to the Kansas City where the RedCards were first introduced and said they accounted for 20 percent of the sales. Target expects same-store sales to be up 2 to 3 percent this holiday quarter despite what one executive said would be a “highly competitive and promotional” Christmas period. Target has tweaked its strategy to try to increase its market share during the holiday season. It is offering to match certain online retailers’ prices and will open its stores at 9 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day, rather than staying closed for that holiday. The company has been opening smaller city stores and is set to open its first Canadian stores in 2013. It will also sell a line of holiday goods with upscale department store Neiman Marcus Group Inc NMRCUS.UL in December. Target Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel told analysts that the number of visits by shoppers to the CityTarget stores, which attract a younger crowd, has been strong. Target said it had earned $637 million, or 96 cents per share, in the third quarter ended on October 27, up from $555 million, or 82 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a gain from the pending sale of its credit card receivables, the profit was 81 cents per share, 4 cents more than what Wall Street analysts were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Adding more food, particularly perishables, and offering the 5-percent card discounts weighed on profitability; gross margin during the quarter slipped 0.2 points to 30.3 percent of sales. But Edward Jones’ Yarborough said Target had managed costs to minimize the impact. The company said it expected to earn between $1.45 and $1.55 per share in the holiday quarter, including expenses linked to its entry into Canada next year. That compares with analysts’ forecasts of $1.51. Target previously said third-quarter sales had increased 3.4 percent to $16.60 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year were up 2.9 percent, helped by higher prices and customers’ buying more items per transaction. Shares of Target were up $1, or 1.6 percent, at $61.38 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

223,TGT,"U.S. shoppers welcome early start to ""Black Friday""","NEW YORK/BLOOMINGTON, Minnesota (Reuters) - Retailers declared their experiment with earlier store openings to kick off the holiday shopping season a success on Friday, with those new hours expected to be a Thanksgiving night staple for more retailers next year. Stores such as Target Corp opened hours before midnight on Thursday to try to capture a bigger piece of the retail pie. The move seemed to bring out a different type of shopper than the usual one who grabs the “Black Friday” deals, analysts said. That meant by Friday morning, some shoppers, like Christian Alcantara, 18, at a J.C. Penney Co Inc store in Queens, New York, had already made a lot of their purchases. J.C. Penney stuck to a more traditional 6 a.m. EST (1100 GMT) Friday opening. “They should open earlier. I’ve been everywhere else and I’ve already shopped,” he said. Shoppers like Alcantara are likely to force holdouts like J.C. Penney to move their post-Thanksgiving sales into Thursday night next year, said Liz Ebert, retail lead at consulting firm KPMG LLP. “There will be pressure on them. There’ll be an expansion of it next year,” Ebert said. Hard data on “Black Friday” store traffic will not come in until this weekend. But analysts said retailers who opened early brought in a non-traditional Black Friday shopper, with more families coming in together and buying more than just the “doorbuster” sale items. “I’ve never seen parents bring so many kids on Black Friday,” Toys R Us Chief Executive Jerry Storch said. The National Retail Federation expects sales during November and December to rise 4.1 percent this year, below last year’s 5.6 percent increase. That made store operators’ strategy important as they battled each other, rather than seeing a growing pie in a season when U.S. retailers can make a third of their annual sales and 40 to 50 percent of their profits. “Retailers want them to buy now, they want to get that share of wallet early,” said Michael Appel, a director at consulting firm AlixPartners. He noticed that the Galleria Mall in White Plains, New York, was busy from midnight to 3 a.m., but that traffic, while still brisk, was less heavy by midmorning. Shoppers used smartphones and tablets and a lot of research as they hit stores, a mobile phenomenon that started last year and seemed to be more prevalent this year. Thom Blischok, chief retail strategist and a senior executive adviser with Booz & Company’s Retail practice, was waiting on line with one woman in Phoenix, who was shopping for a refrigerator. Using her mobile device, she found the appliance online for the same price and left the store without. She intended to buy it online instead. “There’s a fundamental transformation of shopping,” he said. Mobile devices account for 45 percent walmart.com traffic and online traffic coming from Walmart’s mobile app was three times bigger than last year, Joel Anderson, chief executive of Walmart.com, said. Overall, online sales were up 20 percent versus the same period last year, through 3 p.m. EST (2000 GMT) on Friday, IBM said. The National Retail Federation said 147 million people would shop Friday through Sunday, when deals are at their most eye-catching - down from 152 million the same weekend last year. The NRF estimate did not account for Thursday shoppers and anecdotal evidence suggested retailers opening earlier may have cut into traffic on “Black Friday”, the traditional start of the holiday season that denotes the point when retailers in the past would turn a profit for the year. “People seemed to be shopping quite a bit, although in talking to mall management, it seemed that traffic was not as busy as last year,” Deloitte retail analyst Ramesh Swamy said. Retailers were also using technology better, allowing sales staff to match prices customers found online and having them use tablets as mobile “checkout stands” so buyers did not have to wait in line, a service consumers were quickly coming to expect. “I even heard customers complaining about a retailer that didn’t have mobile checkout,” he said. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, two-thirds of shoppers were planning to spend the same amount of money as last year or were unsure about plans, while 21 percent intended to spend less, and 11 percent planned to spend more. “I definitely have more money this year,” said Amy Balser, 26, at the head of the line outside the Best Buy store in the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. “I definitely don’t think (the economy) has bounced back anywhere near as much as it needs to, but I see some improvement,” she said. For others, Christmas is the focal point of their annual shopping. “We cut back spending on birthdays and anniversaries so we’d have more for Christmas. We’ve adapted,” said Cheri Albus, 58, of Papillion, Nebraska, after shopping at J.C. Penney at Westroads Mall in Omaha. Retail stocks rose in holiday-shortened trading on Friday, in line with gains across the market. Among the leaders, Wal-Mart ended up 1.9 percent and Macy’s Inc rose 1.8 percent. Across the country, store lines were long - in the hundreds or more in many places - with the move toward earlier opening hours appearing to help. By sunrise on Friday, it was commonplace, even at large stores in the major cities, to find many more staffers than shoppers. While the shift to earlier openings was criticized by store employees and traditionalists because it pulled people away from families on the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, many shoppers welcomed the chance to shop before midnight or in the early morning hours. Some workers used the day to send a message. OUR Walmart - a coalition of current and former Wal-Mart staff seeking better wages, benefits and working conditions - targeted Black Friday for action across the country after staging protests outside stores for months. Nine protesters were arrested on misdemeanor charges after blocking a street outside a Walmart near Los Angeles, police said. Three of those arrested were Walmart workers, OUR Walmart said. Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s U.S. discount stores, which have been open on Thanksgiving since 1988, offered some Black Friday deals at 8 p.m. on Thursday and special deals on certain electronics, such as Apple Inc iPads, at 10 p.m. At the Macy’s store in Herald Square in Manhattan, the line at the Estee Lauder counter was four deep shortly after its midnight opening. The cosmetics department’s “morning specials” included free high-definition headphones with any fragrance purchase of $75 or more, and a set of six eye shadows for $10. But for some people, cheap wasn’t cheap enough - like the Macy’s shopper who bought Calvin Klein shoes at 50 percent off but was still not satisfied. “I was hoping for deeper discounts,” said Melissa Glascow, 35, of Brooklyn, New York. That could actually be an intentional strategy to help retailers’ profits. “It appears that manufacturers and retailers are making concerted efforts to drive margins, which may take some of the sales sizzle out of a traditionally big selling day/period, but should be positive to gross margins,” Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said in a note to clients. Lines at Best Buy stores were similar to last year but the traffic to its website was “significantly” higher, Shawn Score, head of the company’s U.S. retail business, told Reuters.

224,TGT,"UPDATE 4-""Black Friday"" on Thursday starts U.S. holiday shopping","* Wal-Mart “Black Friday” deals at 8 p.m., Target open at 9 * NRF sees holiday sales up 4.1 pct, down from 2011 increase * Waiting in tents at Best Buy in Florida, but some just look By Martinne Geller and Phil Wahba NEW YORK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - U.S. shoppers took advantage of retailers offering a Thursday night start to the traditional post-Thanksgiving holiday shopping season, lining up at stores to get deals on electronics and other items or to just see what the fuss was about. “I like watching the insanity, honestly,”  Jon Stroker, 40, of Littleton, New Hampshire, said after spending about $280 at a Walmart store in town and taking advantage of the retailer’s 8 p.m. Thursday start of “Black Friday” deals. This year, Target Corp joined Wal-Mart Stores Inc  and Gap Inc in being open at least part of the day on Thursday and some retailers will be open throughout the day, a trend that began to take hold in 2011. Wal-Mart’s U.S. discount stores, which have been open on Thanksgiving Day since 1988, offered some “Black Friday” deals at 8 p.m. local time and special deals on some electronics at 10 p.m. Target has moved its opening from midnight to 9 p.m. on Thursday and Toys R Us is opening at 8 p.m. “It’s a recognition that retailers need to be more aggressive and want to show their physical stores are important,” Moody’s senior analyst Charles O’Shea said. While he didn’t see enormous crowds out in Vauxhall, New Jersey, he did see about 15 people lined up already at a Best Buy, which opens at midnight. At a Target in Westbury, only two shoppers were in line for a 9 p.m. opening. Still, for retailers, any crowd could make the effort worth it. “It’s a finite pie; if you can get a bit more by being open, then do it,” O’Shea said. The National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, forecast a 4.1 percent increase in retail sales during the November-December holiday period this year, down from the 5.6 percent increase seen in 2011. In a separate survey, NRF said 147 million people would shop Friday through Sunday, down from 152 million on Black Friday weekend last year. The survey did not say how many shoppers planned to hit stores on Thursday. Some retailers, like Best Buy Co Inc are keeping Black Friday on Friday, waiting until midnight to open. At a Best Buy in Orlando, people had camped out in tents for days waiting for the doors to open. Gabriel Esteves, 33, a self-employed car audio installer, waited in line with a bag of Cheetos and a Coke while his brother and sister went to their homes for Thanksgiving feasts with their families. “They told me to take a break and go to the house, but today’s the worst day to leave the line. People come and cut in line,” said Esteves, who got in line Monday to buy some small electronics and a 50-inch television. Best Buy, which is trying to stem falling sales under new CEO Hubert Joly, is one of the retailers in the spotlight this season. At some stores, workers were not so happy to have early openings encroach on their Thanksgiving holiday. A petition asking Target to “save Thanksgiving” had 371,606 supporters as of Thursday afternoon. Some shoppers agreed. “I don’t think it’s good,” Carol Lucas, 61, of Sugar Hill, N.H., said while her husband waited for a 32-inch television on sale at Walmart. “You’re messing up Thanksgiving.” Still, at a Target on Chicago’s Northwest Side, the first person waiting in line Thursday night was someone who worked at the store, Elsa Acevedo, 46, who finished her shift at 4:30 a.m. and lined up at about 2:30 p.m. to buy a 50-inch Westinghouse television. As for the earlier opening, “I just think it takes people away from their families,” she said. But she added that a midnight opening also pulled workers away from Thanksgiving celebrations because they had to prepare the stores to open. Many shoppers lured into stores by earlier openings on Thursday may just be window-shopping. More than 50 percent of consumers will do some form of “show-rooming” during the Black Friday weekend, said Kevin Sterneckert, vice president of retail research at Gartner Group. “They will buy things because they looked at it in the store. They will touch and feel what they are interested in and then buy it online on Monday, either from the same retailer or a different online retailer,” Sterneckert said. At a Kmart on 34th Street in Manhattan earlier on Thursday, Charles Montague, a 55-year-old mover, was browsing the aisles just to kill time. “I don’t holiday shop,” he said emphatically. “I buy stuff all year long, not during some man-made holiday.” Some were not waiting for Monday to buy on the Internet. Online Thanksgiving 2012 sales were already up 17.8 percent over Thanksgiving 2011 for the same period, measured through 9 p.m. EST, according to IBM. The stakes are high for U.S. retailers, which can earn more than a third of their annual sales in the holiday season. Consumers heading into the holiday shopping season remain worried about high unemployment and possible tax increases and government spending cuts in 2013. Also, lasting effects of Sandy, the storm that lashed the densely populated East Coast in late October, could cut into how much shoppers can spend on the holidays. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, two-thirds of shoppers said they were planning to spend the same amount as last year or were unsure about spending plans, while 21 percent intend to spend less and 11 percent plan to spend more. “My family decided not to buy (Chanukah) presents this year - only for the kids. It’s too expensive,” said graduate student Danielle Slade, 29, from Jericho, Long Island. Still, the Standard & Poor’s retail index is up almost 27 percent this year, compared with a 10.6 percent increase for the broader S&P; 500. In New York’s Times Square, a mix of locals and tourists lined up at Toys R Us. “We just want to see what’s happening,” said a man who arrived Thursday from Paris. “We want to see what Black Friday is.” A Santa hat-wearing expeditor quickly whisked him and his companion away before they could give their names.

226,TGT,BAY STREET-Canadian retailers brace for Target's cheap chic,"* Target to open across Canada starting next spring * Grocery seen at less risk than apparel, general merchandise * Hudson’s Bay, Sears Canada may both be vulnerable * Beauty offerings could challenge Shoppers Drug Mart By Allison Martell TORONTO, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Canadian retailers of all stripes are bracing for the day next spring when Target Corp  unlocks the doors of its first stores north of the border, but its instant competitive heft probably won’t weigh on all retail stocks equally. Sears Canada Inc and Hudson’s Bay Co - two entrenched department store operators - may have the most to fear from the No. 2 U.S. discounter, retail experts say. Their shares may be most vulnerable. HBC, which went public in November, has traded below its C$17 offer price since its first trading day, partly because of  concerns that its turnaround drive might stall once Target arrives. By contrast, Loblaw Cos Ltd and Metro Inc, mainly grocers by trade, face a lesser threat from Target, and their shares may hold up better. That’s not to say any retailer can afford to ignore Target. The company has “proven its success in the U.S. The consumer landscape in Canada ... isn’t all that different,” said Craig Fehr, Canadian market strategist at Edward Jones in Missouri. “It is going to have a meaningful impact.” Target is arriving at a time when most of the retail sector faces sluggish growth, and many shoppers can’t wait for the discounter’s debut. Thanks to cross-border shopping trips, Target is already well known in much of Canada. KubasPrimedia, a Toronto market research firm, surveyed Canadians last spring and found that 43 percent had already shopped at Target south of the border. Thanks to Target’s “cheap chic” strategy, the retailer’s entry may be felt across the price spectrum. It competes with Wal-Mart Stores Inc on basic goods such as cleaning supplies, but also offers unique clothing and housewares. Target does not need to price match on those trendy items, and that drives traffic, sales and margins. A recent report from Kantar Retail concluded that Hudson’s Bay is particularly exposed, based on how many of its customers plan to shop at Target. Sears, majority-owned by Sears Holdings Corp, typically offers lower prices than HBC, closer to Target’s discount profile, and the chain is already reeling from steep sales declines in established stores. Its shares have fallen almost 15 percent over the last month. Thanks to Wal-Mart’s big push into the sector, Canada’s grocery market is already very competitive. Stewart Samuel, senior retail analyst at IGD, a research firm specializing in food and grocery, sees Target’s Canadian stores offering a smaller food selection than its U.S. outlets, given that its Canadian stores will be smaller than typical Target U.S. stores. Samuel believes the Canadian outlets may end up resembling the chain’s downsized CityTarget stores, which dedicate less space to basic groceries. Even if grocers are hit, Empire Co Ltd’s Sobeys might have bought itself some protection with its deal to supply groceries to Target. Beyond department stores and grocers, Target’s impact is less clear. Edward Jones’ Fehr thinks Canadian Tire Corp Ltd, which sells a combination of auto parts, housewares, apparel and sporting goods across several banners, is particularly vulnerable, but Paul Taylor, chief investment officer of fundamental equities at BMO Asset Management Inc, says it is insulated by its auto parts and sporting goods segments. Then there is Shoppers Drug Mart Corp, Canada’s largest drugstore chain, whose shares are up about 2 percent this year. Tight rules on prescription drug prices make it tough to compete on price in Canada, said Matthew Coffina, a Morningstar analyst focused on pharmacy: “Pharmacies compete much more on convenience.” Coffina sees some impact on Shoppers’ sales of over-the-counter medications and beauty products, one of Target’s strengths, but analysts in general are much more concerned about the impact on Shoppers of new government regulations on generic drugs than about Target.. Taylor believes Target’s impact is already priced into the market, given that investors and retailers have had plenty of time to prepare. Target announced its store locations months ago. “The real question will be execution, and that we’ll have to wait and see,” said Taylor, whose firm owns Loblaw and dollar store chain Dollarama Inc, but not Sears or HBC. And if sorting through winners and losers seems too risky, investors can always follow Taylor’s lead on one point - his firm opted to buy a stake in Target itself.",12092012,http://www.reuters.com/article/canada-column-markets/bay-street-canadian-retailers-brace-for-targets-cheap-chic-idUSL1E8N55YY20121209

228,TGT,"UPDATE 4-Hudson's Bay reports loss, sees little Target overlap","* Same-store sales rise at both Hudson’s Bay and Lord & Taylor * Retail sales up 3.8 percent at C$930.4 million * Superstorm Sandy to weigh on sales in current quarter * CEO says company may one day spin off real estate assets By Allison Martell Dec 11 (Reuters) - Hudson’s Bay Co’s chief executive said on Tuesday that he does not see Canadian customers taking their business away from his department stores when Target Corp makes its debut north of the border in the spring. Shares of HBC, which operates Hudson’s Bay in Canada and Lord & Taylor in the United States, have languished since the company’s November IPO. That partly reflects concern that Target - which bought its first Canadian leases from HBC - will derail HBC’s turnaround once its stores open. “We made the deal with Target, so we did a tremendous amount of analysis before we made that deal,” CEO Richard Baker told Reuters on Tuesday after the company posted a quarterly net loss, and warned that the impact of Superstorm Sandy would weigh on sales in the current period. “While they are a similar customer, there is very, very little product overlap.” Customers will buy different products at Hudson’s Bay and Target, Baker said. When a new Target location opens south of the border, nearby Lord & Taylor stores have not been affected at all, he said. HBC fell 0.4 percent to C$16.75 on Tuesday afternoon on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The stock has been pinned below its C$17 offer price since its first day of trading. Hudson’s Bay, North America’s oldest continually operating company, reported its first quarterly results on Tuesday since the initial public offering. In its third quarter ended Oct. 27, sales rose, but gross profit margin fell to 39.0 percent from 41.3 percent a year earlier, hurt in part by markdowns on seasonal goods. HBC turned a small profit after stripping out restructuring charges and other one-time items. Founded in 1670, the company began as a fur trading business and was granted control of a vast part of what is now Canada by King Charles II. It went private in 2006. NRDC Equity Partners, controlled by Baker and his family, bought out HBC’s other investors in 2008 and integrated the company with Lord & Taylor. Ahead of its long-anticipated IPO, HBC focused on its two marquee banners, winding down discount chains Fields and Zellers, and selling many of its Zellers leases to Target in a C$1.83 billion deal. Baker said his team has made progress in improving the performances of both Hudson’s Bay and Lord & Taylor, but he allowed that the turnaround, which kicked off with their 2008 investment, was still a work in progress. “We have what we believe is a long runway of opportunity,” he said. “We didn’t wait five years to go public until everything was perfectly fixed and everything was one hundred percent done.” In its earnings release, HBC warned that Superstorm Sandy would weigh on sales. The storm battered the northeastern United States in late October, just after the end of the company’s fiscal third quarter, forcing HBC to close or cut hours at 80 percent of its Lord & Taylor stores. In November, consolidated sales at established stores were little changed, with a 9.0 percent rise at Hudson’s Bay offsetting a 12.4 percent decline at Lord & Taylor. The effects of the storm may reduce sales in the current quarter by about $20 million and lead to “moderately higher” inventory at Lord & Taylor, the company said. But so far, it looks like the issue was temporary. “We saw a really strong Thanksgiving, Black Friday weekend, so we’re encouraged that things are getting back to normal in most areas,” said Chief Financial Officer Michael Culhane in an interview. In a conference call with analysts and investors, Baker said HBC may one day spin off its property assets into a real estate investment trust, following a path taken recently by Loblaw Cos Ltd, Canada’s No.1 grocery store operator. “We’ve always believed that sometime in the future we could have the opportunity to create a REIT, similar to what Loblaw’s is proposing,” said Baker, who is best known as a real estate investor. “We are not presently working on this plan, but it is something that we often talk about.” The company owns or ground leases more than 11 million square feet of retail space. SAME-STORE SALES RISE In the third quarter, sales at stores open at least 13 months rose 4.5 percent at Hudson’s Bay. The key metric increased 5.2 percent at Lord & Taylor when measured in U.S. dollars. Consolidated same-store sales were up 3.5 percent, weighed down by a decline at Home Outfitters, HBC’s housewares chain. At the end of the third quarter, it had 90 Hudson’s Bay stores, 48 mainline Lord & Taylor locations and 69 Home Outfitters outlets. It also operates two Lord & Taylor Home and three Lord & Taylor Outlet stores. The company reported a net loss of C$2.0 million, or 2 Canadian cents a share, compared with year-earlier earnings of C$1.24 billion, or 12 Canadian cents a share. Excluding restructuring costs and other items unrelated to day-to-day operations, earnings were C$800,000, compared with a loss of C$5.0 million a year earlier.

229,TGT,UPDATE 1-What fiscal cliff? US shoppers shrug off budget debate,"* 73 pct say fiscal cliff didn’t affect holiday spending * 57 pct spent same as they did in 2011-poll * Dec. same-store sales view up 3.3 pct vs 4.2 pct yr ago   (Updates December same-store sales forecasts, adds details on Target) By Jessica Wohl Jan 2 (Reuters) - The “fiscal cliff” drama that dominated the news and spooked businesses and financial markets did little to dampen spending by U.S. shoppers this holiday season. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows nearly three-quarters of Americans said the debate around the fiscal cliff had no impact on their holiday spending. Fewer than 20 percent of those polled said they spent less during the season than they did in the 2011 holidays, according to the poll. Holiday season sales overall - including December sales data from several chains due this week - were likely good, but not great. The expected rise in 2012 holiday spending is poised to show the smallest year-over-year gain since the recession led to a sales drop in 2008. Various estimates suggest that U.S. sales in November and December combined grew at a low single-digit pace, slower than in 2011 and 2010. The fiscal cliff was a nearly constant topic in the news, as the country waited to see if politicians in Washington would reach a deal to avoid $600 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax increases. On Tuesday, the U.S. Congress approved a bill that would raise taxes on the wealthy and preserve certain benefits. The vote averted immediate pain like tax hikes for almost all U.S. households, but did not resolve the issue of raising the federal debt ceiling and fights over the budget in coming months. Seventy-three percent of those polled in the final days of December said concerns about the fiscal cliff did not affect their holiday spending at all, according to findings from an Ipsos poll conducted for Reuters. Back in mid-November, before the holiday season kicked into full gear, 58 percent of those polled had said the fiscal cliff was not affecting their holiday plans. Only 15 percent of those polled in late December said they spent less during the 2012 holiday season because of the fiscal cliff. In mid-November, 28 percent said that they planned to spend less because of the fiscal cliff. Fifty-seven percent of those polled said that they spent the same amount on holiday shopping in 2012 that they did in 2011. Nineteen percent said that they spent less than they did in 2011, while 17 percent said that they spent more. The poll findings are from an Ipsos poll conducted for Thomson Reuters from Dec. 27 to Dec. 31, with 765 American adults interviewed online. Results are within the poll’s credibility intervals, a tool used to account for statistical variation in Internet-based polling. The credibility interval was plus or minus 4 percentage points. The poll is the latest in a series that Ipsos conducted during the holiday season. Taking a look at various retailers, discount chains as a group likely saw the strongest sales growth last month, while profits at some retailers may have taken a hit from the need for sharp discounts to clear merchandise from shelves. “Value and promotions drove consumers to the malls,” according to Jharonne Martis, director of consumer research for Thomson Reuters. “Big discounts and promotions could cut into retailers’ profit margins.” Costco Wholesale Corp is expected to post a 6.5 percent rise in December same-store sales. While Costco holds the highest estimate of any of the 17 chains included in the Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S tally of analysts’ forecasts, the expectations are still below the 7 percent growth the chain posted in December 2011. Still, some analysts are concerned about how Target Corp  fared. The discount chain appeared to struggle with efforts such as its highly touted collaboration of holiday gifts with Neiman Marcus, which Target marked down by 50 percent even before Christmas. On Wednesday, the remaining goods were marked down by 70 percent on Target’s web site and by 50 percent on Neiman Marcus’ site. Target forecast a low single-digit percentage increase in December same-store sales and analysts’ average forecast was for a 0.8 percent rise as of Wednesday. Jefferies analyst Daniel Binder said he expects such sales were just flat to up 1 percent, while JP Morgan analyst Christopher Horvers cut his expectation to a 0.5 percent increase after calling for a 2.5 percent rise. Overall, analysts are looking for 3.3 percent same-store sales growth for December across 17 chains, down from 4.2 percent growth in December 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Such sales rose a disappointing 1.6 percent in November. In December 2008, same-store sales fell 3 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “December’s results will reflect a modest slowdown in overall spending over the past two months ... but the world is not ending,” JP Morgan’s Matthew Boss said in a note this week. The weakest December same-store sales are expected to come from teen apparel chain Wet Seal Inc. Monthly same-store sales tallies exclude major players such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Home Depot Inc and Best Buy Co Inc, as well as online leader Amazon.com Inc .

232,TGT,Target to match some rivals' online prices year-round,"(Reuters) - Target Corp said on Tuesday it will match on a year-round basis the prices found on the websites of key rivals Amazon.com Inc, Best Buy Co Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Toys R Us, its latest tactic to hold onto shoppers focused on price. The move extends an online price-matching program that Target introduced over the holiday season and which was supposed to last only from November 1 to December 16. It also comes after Target last week reported flat sales growth in December at stores open at least a year. “I think this is largely symbolic, it’s akin to removing the Kindle from their stores,” said Wells Fargo analyst Matt Nemer, referring to Target’s decision to stop selling Amazon’s tablet devices last year. In November, Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel said Target was not seeing a lot of price-match activity in its stores. “It’s not likely to have a huge impact on financials or customer behavior,” said Nemer, who noted that customers are not likely to go to Target’s guest services desk for a refund for just a small difference in price. Also, much of what Target sells, such as apparel and accessories, is exclusive to the store, so there would be no comparable prices from competitors. But Target will now also match prices year-round from its own website in its stores. Nemer called that “a really important step,” saying it removes confusion for customers who sometimes see different prices for products such as televisions in stores and online. While shopping online has grown rapidly in recent years, it still represents a small fraction of overall shopping in the United States. Target’s policy of matching online prices differs from policies at several chains, which match only printed advertised prices for items sold at stores. Target said that throughout the year it will match the price when a customer buys an eligible item at one of its stores and finds the same item at a lower price in the following week’s Target circular or in a local competitor’s printed ad. It will also match the price if the customer finds the same item at a lower price within a week on Target’s website or the websites of Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and Toys R Us. Amazon says it offers competitive prices and does not offer price matching when an item’s price drops after a customer buys it, with the exception of televisions. Walmart matches the prices of print ads from competitors and said it has no plans to change its policy. Walmart also says it checks the prices of 30,000 items at competing chains each week to make sure it has the lowest prices. Best Buy matches the price from a local competitor’s store, a local Best Buy store or its own web site. Toys R Us matches in-store prices and certain online prices. Shares of Target were down 60 cents at $60.70 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

237,TGT,H&R; sees Primaris deal as once in a lifetime chance,"(Reuters) - H&R; Real Estate Investment Trust (HR_u.TO) has launched a $4.5 billion bid to buy Primaris Retail REIT PMZ_u.TO because it is a “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity to capitalize on Target Corp’s (TGT.N) imminent expansion into Canada. The opening of the No. 2 U.S. discounter’s first Canadian store this spring comes at a time when other retailers are also looking to expand north of the border. To do so, they will have to vie for prime real estate assets. Primaris owns some 35 properties in cities across Canada, including the Dufferin Mall in Toronto, the Cornwall Centre in Regina, Saskatchewan and the Tecumseh Mall in Windsor. Its tenants include Canadian household names such as Hudson’s Bay, Canadian Tire (CTC.TO) and Reitmans (RET.TO). It also owns about 10 Zellers outlets, which are now being converted into Target stores. The friendly cash-and-equity deal, announced late on Wednesday, values Primaris at about C$2.76 billion ($2.8 billion) and it marginally trumps a C$2.63 billion hostile bid made in December by a consortium led by Canada’s KingSett Capital. The consortium extended its all-cash offer on Thursday to February 4. For H&R;, this is a story about “getting better, getting stronger and buying at a time when there is a game-changer out there called Target,” H&R; Chief Executive Tom Hofstedter said on a conference call on Thursday. “This really, really is an opportunity that is once in a lifetime at a time when the changing landscape for retail is going to make tremendous value for these assets.” But many investors on the call expressed dismay at the size of the break-up fee being offered to H&R; if the deal fails, as it potentially scuttles any hope of a rival offer or a sweetened bid from the KingSett-led consortium. Primaris CEO John Morrison defended the size of the C$106.6 million break-up fee. He said the company accepted the H&R; bid only after reviewing other offers during its review process. The break-up fee is structured as a cash payment of C$70 million and an option to acquire Toronto’s Dufferin Mall and certain Yonge Street properties owned by Primaris. H&R; has also been granted a right to match any superior proposal received by Primaris. Last year, Target, the second-largest U.S. discounter, agreed to take over the Canadian leases for some Zellers stores owned by Hudson’s Bay Co (HBC.TO) in a deal worth some C$1.8 billion. RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust, Canada’s largest REIT, last year signed a C$1 billion joint venture to develop outlet malls in Canada with U.S.-based Tanger Factory Outlet Centers. H&R; units fell 2 percent to close at C$23.28 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, while those of Primaris rose 7 Canadian cents to close at C$26.58 on Thursday.

241,TGT,"Sears Canada shares down on Target's entry plans, weak results","(Reuters) - Department store chain Sears Canada Inc SCC.TO reported a fall in revenue for the 16th straight quarter on a day when Target Corp (TGT.N) said it would open its first 24 Canadian stores by April, intensifying competition in an already crowded market. Shares of Sears Canada, 51 percent owned by U.S.-based Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O), fell as much as 4 percent to a two-year low of C$8.88 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Sears Canada said on Wednesday its revenue for the November-January quarter, which includes the critical holiday shopping season, fell 5 percent to C$1.29 billion. Sales at established stores fell 3.8 percent on lower sales of home electronics and snowblowers. Department stores in Canada and the United States are struggling with declining sales of electronics as they face increasing competition from online retailers. In addition, Canadian retail sales plunged 2.1 percent in December in a weak Christmas shopping season, Statistics Canada said on Friday. Department store sales fell 9.6 percent. Sears Canada is also facing increasing competition as U.S. retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) expand their Canadian operations and new ones like Target enter the country. To compete with the new entrants and to reclaim lost market share, Sears Canada announced a three-year plan in 2012 that includes making radical changes to its pricing strategies and sprucing up stores. However, Chief Executive Calvin McDonald said last month he was not entirely happy with the company’s progress in the 19 months since he took the top job. Target and Wal-Mart Stores continue to be bullish on the Canadian market despite the falling sales at Sears Canada and Canadian Tire Corp (CTCa.TO).

244,TGT,"UPDATE 3-Target cautious after weak holiday quarter, shares fall","* Fourth-quarter profit $1.47/shr vs Street view $1.48 * Sees 2 percent sales growth for 2013 * Shares down 1 percent after steeper decline By Jessica Wohl Feb 27 (Reuters) - Target Corp on Wednesday offered a cautious outlook for consumer spending in 2013 following a weak holiday quarter and said it was on track with its massive Canadian store opening plans this year. The discount retailer’s fourth-quarter profit fell short of Wall Street expectations as the number of purchases dropped 1 percent, the first such decline in 14 quarters. Its shares fell nearly 1 percent at $63.46 after dropping as much as 3.7 percent. “The U.S. economy is growing at a painfully slow rate,” Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel said on a conference call. “We have a tempered view of the near-term sales environment,” he said, adding that shoppers, or “guests” as Target calls them, are “quite resilient.” Target’s sales started off softly in February, similar to results at rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc, though things improved as the month progressed. Target is testing programs such as letting shoppers pay online and pick up in-store, or have items delivered on the same day as well as catering to customers using mobile devices. Some of the plans discussed on Wednesday were similar to efforts already tested or rolled out by Walmart. Target will have a transition year: It is selling its credit card portfolio to Toronto-Dominion Bank  this quarter and opening 124 Canadian stores, more than it has ever handled in a single year. The Canada plans cut earnings by 48 cents per share in 2012 and should trim earnings by about 45 cents in 2013. Target expects sales to rise about 2 percent this year, down from 5.1 percent growth last year, which had an extra sales week. Sales at stores open at least a year should rise in line with 2012’s 2.7 percent increase. The fourth-quarter marked Target’s weakest holiday season performance since 2008, and some strength in January helped prop up what could have been even weaker numbers, said Sandy Skrovan, U.S. research director at Planet Retail. “Walmart proved the victor over Target for the 2012 holiday season,” Skrovan said, pointing out that Walmart U.S. same-store sales rose 1 percent in the quarter. “But Target won the year overall since, unlike Walmart, its affluent shopper base tends to be more insulated from economic swings.” While food and other basics sold well, shoppers held back from discretionary purchases like toys in an uncertain economy. Shoppers bought 0.7 percent more each time they shopped and the average spent was up 1.4 percent. “Given the size of the company, anything that they do is linked inextricably with the economy,” said Cowen & Co analyst Faye Landes. “In addition, they are in the fashion business and that business is clearly not without risk.” Target’s holiday season included a disappointing showing for its collection of gifts sold in collaboration with high-end department store chain Neiman Marcus. The line that included designer dresses and dishes launched on Dec. 1, and Target sharply discounted the goods even before Christmas. Wal-Mart said last week that Walmart U.S. same-store sales were likely to be flat this quarter as consumers faced higher gasoline prices and smaller paychecks after the expiration of the U.S. payroll tax cut. At Target, more shoppers used its credit and debit cards. The cards offer a 5 percent discount to foster customer loyalty, but the discount can also pressure margins. Target said 15.5 percent of store sales during the quarter were paid with its cards, up from 14 percent in the third quarter and 10.8 percent a year earlier. The fourth-quarter gross margin declined to 27.8 percent of sales from 28.4 percent a year earlier, due to the increased card usage, remodeling and markdowns on seasonal merchandise. Target earned $961 million, or $1.47 per share, in the quarter, down from $981 million, or $1.45 per share, a year earlier. Target had fewer shares outstanding in the latest period. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of $1.48 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding items such as costs related to Canada, rose to $1.65 from $1.49 a year ago. Target tempered profit expectations back in early January, when it said earnings would just meet or somewhat exceed the low end of its prior view for net earnings of $1.45 to $1.55 per share and adjusted profit of $1.64 to $1.74 per share. For the current year, Target forecast adjusted earnings of $4.85 to $5.05 per share, which would exceed the $4.76 it earned last year. It forecast first-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.10 to $1.20 per share versus $1.11 a year ago. It was not immediately clear how the company’s profit forecast compared to analysts’ expectations. Target previously said fourth-quarter sales rose 6.8 percent to $22.37 billion, with same-store sales up 0.4 percent. Same-store sales missed analysts’ average target of 0.8 percent. Meanwhile, Dollar Tree Inc, which sells low-priced items, said fourth-quarter sales soared 15.4 percent as it opens more stores and sells more food. Its shares jumped 12.5 percent.",2272013,http://www.reuters.com/article/target-results/update-3-target-cautious-after-weak-holiday-quarter-shares-fall-idUSL1N0BR1VE20130227

Target’s bold entry is expected to threaten a range of Canadian retailers, from department store operators to grocers and pharmacies, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc has planned its own growth spurt in Canada to defend its turf. Target will open three stores in southern Ontario on Tuesday, the first wave of a multi-billion dollar push into Canada that will add 124 stores by this Christmas shopping season. “We know this is an incredibly competitive retail market place,” Target Canada president Tony Fisher told reporters during a store tour in Guelph, an hour’s drive from the Ontario capital of Toronto. “We have a lot to learn, and so I think we’re going to hit a lot of home-runs, but I think we’re also going to have some misses as well.” The other two pilot stores are in the small Ontario towns of Milton and Fergus. They are the first of two dozen stores in the province that will welcome customers later this month, before their official opening in April. Target expects to spend $1.5 billion on its Canadian expansion this year and some $500 million next year. The Minneapolis-based retailer expects big things from Canada, with annual Canadian sales seen rising to at least C$6 billion in as little as six years, compared to the $72 billion the chain currently sells in the United States. It has also said that many of its Canadian stores will likely be much more profitable than its average U.S. locations. While Canadian stores have less retail space than standard U.S. stores, averaging 114,000 square feet versus 135,000 square feet, Target said they will carry a full range of products, unlike the chain’s smaller CityTarget U.S. outlets. Canadian outlets will offer everything from groceries, though not fresh produce, to Apple computer products, as well as the cheap-chic fashion lines for which Target is well-known. To reflect Canadian tastes, for example, Target has worked with Roots Canada, a domestic brand featuring a beaver in its logo, to offer a limited edition fashion line. Fisher said Target Canada will seek an environmental certification for all 124 stores, to reflect energy efficient equipment such as motion-sensor freezer lights. Target has hired 5,000 employees in Canada for its first wave of store openings and expects to hire 27,000 in total. It will run three distribution centers, two of which have already opened. Wal-Mart, which set up shop in Canada in 1994, plans to invest more than $750 million in 2013 to open or remodel 73 Canadian stores, its most ambitious Canadian expansion ever.",3042013,http://www.reuters.com/article/target-canada/target-gives-peek-at-first-canadian-stores-in-expansion-push-idUSL1N0BWEK020130304

Arabtec underwent a management shake-up last month, driven by its biggest shareholder Abu Dhabi investment fund Aabar, which saw its chief executive replaced. Arabtec, which bought a 60-percent stake of Target in 2007, is expected to announce the deal in coming days. No valuation was immediately available. Arabtec declined to comment. Target Engineering specialises in oil and gas and marine projects with operations in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The unlisted firm’s turnover was $387 million last year, according to its website. Target’s current work in hand, as of end 2012, was $310 million, with turnover for 2013 estimated to be around $477 million, the website stated. “This makes perfect sense for Arabtec considering their plans to grow the oil and gas business. Target is well experienced in such projects and their work is growing,” said an analyst who did not wish to be identified. Arabtec said last month it would rely on the reputation of its biggest shareholder and proceeds from a planned $1.8 billion capital raising to expand its business. Aabar owns stakes in companies such as commodities trader Glencore and Italian bank UniCredit. Cario-based EFG-Hermes said in a Feb. 28 note that Arabtec might use funds from the capital hike to take over Dubai interiors contracting firm Depa, in which it has a 23.4 percent stake. One source close to the company said the Target acquisition would be one of the first key steps made by the new management. Aabar has been exerting its influence since it started buying shares in the company last year. It replaced four Arabtec board members with its own candidates and named its chairman, Kadem Abdulla al-Qubaisi, as Arabtec’s chairman.

It had earlier forecast same-store sales to be flat to up 2 percent. “We see this (outlook) as largely expected, given the far-reaching discussion of weak March retail sales,” Stifel Nicolaus analyst David Schick said. U.S. retail sales contracted for the second time in three months in March, falling 0.4 percent, a Commerce Department report said. But readings for retail sales have been volatile so far this year, making it difficult to know whether the weakness in March was due to a tax hike that went into effect at the start of the year or to temporary factors related to the weather. “Target (and retail overall) face difficult comparisons from the first quarter of 2012. So we see the first quarter update as non-issue essentially,” Schick said in a note. In its first quarter last year, Target reported a same-store sales gain of 5.3 percent, its strongest quarterly performance in more than six years at the time. Target on Tuesday stood by its full-year forecast for adjusted earnings of $4.85 to $5.05 per share. Target in February offered a cautious outlook for consumer spending in 2013 and Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel said “the U.S. economy is growing at a painfully slow rate.” “We must acknowledge that seasonal categories are more discretionary and more economically sensitive, particularly following the payroll tax increases at the beginning of the year,” analyst David Strasser of Janney Capital Markets wrote in a note. Strasser was expecting comparable-store sales to rise 0.5 percent. Target is undergoing a year of transition in which it is selling its credit card portfolio to Toronto-Dominion Bank   and opening 124 Canadian stores. It expects net accounting gains of about 36 cents from the sale of the credit card portfolio and a dilution of about 23 cents related to its Canadian business to net earnings per share in the first quarter. The company expects to report its first-quarter numbers on May 22. Shares of the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based company were down marginally at $68.01 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.",4162013,http://www.reuters.com/article/target-results/update-2-target-warns-current-quarter-profit-will-miss-forecasts-idUSL2N0D30LI20130416

256,TGT,Target tests if Facebook-driven deals bring shoppers into stores,"(Reuters) - Target Corp is rolling out Cartwheel, a service that combines social networking and discounts, the latest attempt by a U.S. retailer to lure shoppers into its physical stores rather that seeing them buy from online rivals. Target said its new program relies on shoppers using their Facebook accounts. However, shoppers can only redeem the offers they choose in Target’s U.S. stores, not online. With Cartwheel, shoppers select the deals they want online and then bring a barcode - either on paper or on a mobile phone - to a Target store to get the discounts. Shoppers can see what offers their Facebook friends have chosen, and earn more offers by having their Facebook friends sign up. This service comes as traditional retailers try to keep shoppers buying from them rather than from Amazon.com Inc and other online-only retailers, especially as shoppers use their smartphones to compare prices. Twenty percent of cellphone owners research products using their phones before they buy, and 18 percent of them compare prices on their phones before making a purchase, according to Bill Tancer, general manager of global research for Experian Marketing Services. Cartwheel follows efforts such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc letting shoppers in some of its U.S. stores scan their goods with their iPhones while they shop and then more quickly proceed through a self-checkout lane. Sears Holdings Corp’s “Member Assist” program gives its loyal shoppers the ability to get personalized shopping advice from in-store personnel without even stepping foot in a Sears or Kmart store. “It is very fascinating to see the very different approaches that retailers are taking to achieve the same goals,” said Carol Spieckerman, president of newmarketbuilders, a retail strategy firm. Retailers are using digital tools to better cater to shoppers who love to comparison shop while in their stores. Target and other retailers offer free WiFi, and at one of its Minnesota stores Best Buy Co Inc has tested its “Page a Blue Shirt” service that lets customers summon a store associate with a click on a store iPad. For chains such as Kmart, Target and Walmart, such issues are increasingly important as their businesses have evolved since each opened its doors in 1962. Their stores used to be one-stop shops for everything from books and movies to photo developing. As such services have waned in popularity with the rise of digital books, movies and photo sharing sites, the chains are doing what they can to figure out new ways to make their stores more attractive to shoppers and, ultimately, more profitable. Starting on May 8, Target is opening Cartwheel to the public in a beta test, and asking for feedback as it makes changes. The service will initially be advertised on Target’s website, through Facebook and in emails to Target’s best shoppers and card holders. Target did not rule out the possibility of allowing Cartwheel offers to be redeemed on its website someday. Target said it worked in a close partnership with Facebook Inc for about a year. While Facebook has worked on the project, Cartwheel is owned by Target. For now, Target has no plans to extend it to other social sites such as Pinterest. Linking offers through Facebook will let the retailer know exactly what Facebook can or cannot accomplish for it. While Twitter can be useful to promote timely, limited offers, Facebook is “the dominant platform” for connecting with shoppers and, in turn, with their connections, Spieckerman said. Target sees the program as a way to extend the trips shoppers take into parts of the store they might normally skip, in order to pick up a promoted item. An app coming in June will let shoppers scan a photo of an item’s barcode to quickly see if an offer is available on that item. Shoppers using Cartwheel can choose from hundreds of deals on items such as Target’s own Threshold home goods and name brand goods such as M&Ms; candy and Coca-Cola soft drinks. The weekly, monthly and quarterly deals include discounts from 5 percent off to as much as 40 percent off of certain goods, and differ from other Target offers in circulars or coupon booklets. Shoppers can share the deals they are picking with their Facebook friends, but offers on more discreet items - from bras to Tums - will not be visible to others.

258,TGT,"Target goes hunting in Silicon Valley, following Wal-Mart","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) said on Friday it opened a new San Francisco office to track down technology companies that can help the second-largest U.S. retailer grow its online commerce business. Target’s Technology Innovation Center is run by David Newman, an executive who spent six years at the online business of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), which has had a major presence in Silicon Valley for several years. “Partnership is in our DNA and early-stage companies can sense that and are proving to be very willing to partner and co-develop,” said Newman. Many retailers are pouring money into new technology to help them catch up with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), which has become the world’s largest retailer by grabbing market share from traditional bricks-and-mortar stores. Mobile commerce, powered by smartphone-wielding shoppers, is a particular focus of retailers because this technology has the potential to revitalize in-store sales. Target’s San Francisco office will focus on “core commerce” initiatives, such as speeding up the company’s website. However, it also aims to bring more digital shopping experiences into the retailer’s physical stores through smartphones, Newman said. One area Target is exploring is “augmented reality,” which uses smartphone cameras to give shoppers a digital view of store aisles and show them related products, Newman said. That technology is still a long way off, but Newman noted that Target is already working with eBay Inc (EBAY.O) and Google Inc (GOOG.O), two Silicon Valley giants, on same-day delivery tests. Target also recently began testing a service that allows its employees to order products online and pick them up in the retailer’s stores. The company plans to roll this out to customers this Fall. Wal-Mart’s e-commerce offices, south of San Francisco, have churned out a slew of new online and mobile technology in recent years and these efforts might be showing early signs of success. First-quarter e-commerce sales jumped 30 percent from a year earlier, Wal-Mart reported earlier this week. “The company seems to be gaining traction in several geographies with different technologies such as Scan & Go, Ship from Store and increased mobile capabilities,” Robert Drbul, a retail analyst at Barclays, wrote in a note to investors on Thursday.

260,TGT,Target cuts full-year forecast after weak first quarter,,5222013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-target-results/target-cuts-full-year-forecast-after-weak-first-quarter-idUSBRE94L0GJ20130522
261,TGT,UPDATE 3-Target cuts full-year forecast after weak first quarter,"* Adjusted EPS 82 cents vs Street view 85 cents * Revenue $16.71 billion vs view $16.78 billion * Shares down more than 3 percent By Jessica Wohl May 22 (Reuters) - Target Corp cut its full-year profit forecast on Wednesday while turning in a weak first quarter with disappointing sales, as a chilly start to spring kept shoppers from buying seasonal items like clothing. Target warned in April its first-quarter results would be weaker than anticipated, and its performance was even worse than revised Wall Street expectations due to the cool weather and the impact of higher payroll taxes on spending. Shares of Target fell 3.6 percent to $68.70. First-quarter sales at stores open at least a year fell 0.6 percent, while analysts targeted a 0.03 percent decline, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Back in April, Target forecast same-store sales would be about flat versus its previous outlook of flat to up 2 percent. “This is Target’s weakest quarterly same-store sales performance since the Great Recession year of 2009,” said Sandy Skrovan, U.S. research director at Planet Retail. The last time Target’s quarterly same-store sales fell was in the third quarter of 2009, when it posted a decline of 1.6 percent. This year, shoppers held off buying spring merchandise such as clothing, fans and garden supplies as a chilly start to the season left them little reason to splurge. “Across the board things were disappointing for a lot of retailers,” Skrovan said. The U.S. economy has been somewhat resilient. Core U.S. retail sales, which strip out automobiles, gasoline and building materials, rose 0.5 percent in April, after an upwardly revised 0.1 percent gain in March. The end of a 2 percent payroll tax cut took effect on Jan. 1 and the smaller paychecks have made some consumers less willing to spend. Still, declining gasoline prices have offset some of the drag on household income. “While weather was a clear negative in (the first quarter), the revised view suggests that underlying pressure on moderate income consumer spending remains,” said Bernstein Research analyst Colin McGranahan. The pressure is not limited to Target. Last week, Wal-Mart Stores Inc posted an unexpected 1.4 percent decline in same-store sales at its Walmart U.S. unit, while Kohl’s Corp  posted a 1.9 percent decline in same-store sales. And on Wednesday, Lowe’s Cos Inc reported weaker-than-expected quarterly profit, hurt by the chilly weather as well as competition from larger rival Home Depot Inc. Target earned $498 million, or 77 cents per share, in the first quarter ended on May 4, compared with a profit of $697 million, or $1.04 per share, a year earlier. Including the effects from opening Canadian stores, but excluding losses related to the early retirement of debt and gains from the sale of its credit card business, Target earned 82 cents per share. On that basis, analysts looked for 85 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total sales rose 1 percent to $16.71 billion, while analysts expected $16.78 billion in revenue. The number of transactions in stores open at least a year fell 1.9 percent. Shoppers spent more overall and bought more items, but the selling price per unit was down, suggesting lower-priced items like groceries were selling well, Skrovan said. Also, more shoppers took advantage of the 5 percent discount offered to Target’s REDcard holders. It said 17.1 percent of sales in its stores were paid for with REDcard credit and debit cards, versus 11.6 percent a year ago. Target said its first 24 Canadian stores, opened in March, generated $86 million in sales in the quarter. The company, which plans to have 124 stores in Canada by the end of the year, said costs related to the Canadian launch reduced earnings by 24 cents per share in the first quarter. Target now expects adjusted earnings of $4.70 to $4.90 per share this year, down from its April forecast of $4.85 to $5.05.",5222013,http://www.reuters.com/article/target-results/update-3-target-cuts-full-year-forecast-after-weak-first-quarter-idUSL2N0E30EZ20130522

263,TGT,Fitch Affirms Target's IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed its long-term Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) on Target Corporation (Target) at 'A-', and its short-term IDR at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Target had  $12.3 billion of senior notes outstanding as of May 4, 2013. A full rating list  is shown below. Key Rating Drivers: The affirmation reflects Target's strong competitive position in the discount  retail sector and steady operating performance. The ratings further reflect the  debt repayment with the proceeds from the sale of the company's credit card  receivables, and a relatively steady financial profile on a retail-only basis.  Target completed the sale of its credit business to TD Bank in March 2013. The  sale price was the gross value of the receivables of $5.7 billion, of which 90%  is targeted for debt repayment and the balance for share repurchases.  This  level of debt repayment is consistent with the amount of debt that Fitch had  assigned to the credit business, as it was assumed that the receivables  portfolio was 90% debt-financed.  The sale of the credit card receivables eliminates a more cyclical business  while preserving the customer loyalty benefit for TGT's retail business, and  permits TGT to share in the profits of the credit business going forward.   Target's core U.S. retail business generated comparable store (comp) sales  growth in 2010-2012, ranging from 2.1% to 3.0%. Comp sales turned negative in  first quarter 2013 (1Q'13), coming in at (0.6%), most likely reflecting the  payroll tax hike, continued weak employment growth, and cool spring weather.     The challenging environment facing low- and middle-income consumers will likely  continue to constrain sales growth in the near term. This pressure will be  offset in part by the incremental volume driven by the addition of fresh food to  more stores and the 5% rewards program for users of the Target credit and debit  cards. Fitch expects positive comp sales of around 2% for the full year.  These two programs are expected to be relatively neutral to EBIT margin rates as  sales growth improves, and as the cost of the 5% discounts and the impact on  margin rates from selling lower-margin food is offset by the effect of  leveraging fixed costs against expected higher sales, lowering the operating  expense ratio. However, Target's U.S. retail segment will benefit going forward  from credit card profit sharing, which should drive the segment EBIT margin to  around 7.3% from 7.0% historically.  The company plans to open 124 stores in Canada in 2013 in former Zellers sites.  Fitch expects operating cash flow in 2013 (excluding proceeds from the credit  card receivables sale) will cover the incremental capex to build out these  stores, as well as most of the current year's dividend, and free cash flow (FCF)  is expected to be relatively neutral. FCF is expected to accelerate to more than  $2 billion in 2014 and beyond as Canada is expected to move from a net use of  cash flow to a source of cash flow.  Adjusted leverage was 2.2x at May 2013, compared with 2.5x at end-2012 (Feb. 2,  2013) on a consolidated basis (including credit card receivables), and 2.0x at  year-end on a retail-only basis.  Fitch assumes that TGT will use share  repurchases to manage its adjusted debt/EBITDAR at or around its current level,  and that these repurchases will be partly debt-financed beginning in 2014.   Rating Sensitivities: A positive rating action could be triggered by strong operating momentum in the  domestic business, a successful expansion into Canada, and a policy to maintain  leverage at or below 2.0x.  A negative rating action could be triggered by operating shortfalls and/or more  aggressive share repurchase activity that drove leverage to over 2.5x.   Fitch affirms the following: Target Corporation --Long-term IDR at 'A-';  --Senior unsecured debt at 'A-'; --Bank credit facility at 'A-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'.

264,TGT,"Celebrity chef Paula Deen loses more deals, but book sales soar","LOS ANGELES, June 27 (Reuters) - U.S. celebrity chef Paula Deen saw more lucrative deals evaporate on Thursday despite her renewed apologies for using a racial slur, as retailer Target Corp and drug company Novo Nordisk A/S joined the list of sponsors distancing themselves from the doyenne of Southern cooking. But in a sign that Deen could make a comeback, her upcoming cookbook “Paula Deen’s New Testament,” which features “lightened up” recipes, shot to the top of the Amazon books best-sellers list this week on pre-orders for the Oct. 15 release. And her “Southern Cooking Bible” is No. 2 on the list. Experts say not all may be lost for Deen despite the exodus of sponsors and they point to the comeback of another domestic maven, Martha Stewart, who was able to rebuild her career and image after serving jail time for insider trading. Deen, 66, has been in damage control mode after a deposition surfaced last week in which she admitted to using the “N-word.” She released online apology videos and made a tearful appearance on NBC’s “Today” on Wednesday. For Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys Inc, a consumer and brand loyalty consulting firm, Deen’s apology was “too little, too late.” “She came across as very defensive and when you are talking about contrition, the two words don’t really go together,” Passikoff said. “While she had reasonable brand values that worked for her sponsors, she’s not the only one available and these days sponsors don’t need to take a chance on folks that self destruct,” he added. Forbes estimated Deen’s earnings at $17 million in 2011, placing her fourth on its list of highest-earning chefs last year as her privately held company, Paula Deen Enterprises,  expanded. The contract with Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical company, came in 2012 after she revealed that she had been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. As spokeswoman for the maker of diabetes care and equipment she would earn an estimated $6 million over three years, according to Forbes. The company said in a statement that it had “mutually agreed” with Deen to suspend her partnership with the company “while she takes time to focus her attention where it is needed.” Deen’s merchandising deals, which include cookware, homeware and books, have an estimated value of about $7 million, according to Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst for market researcher The NPD Group. Cohen also estimated Deen’s food and restaurant branding deals added another $6 million to $7 million to her empire. Retail giants Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target  and Home Depot Inc all cut ties with Deen within 24 hours of her “Today Show” appearance. “We have made a decision to phase out the Paula Deen merchandise in our stores as well as on Target.com,” Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said in a statement. “Once the merchandise is sold out, we will not be replenishing inventory.” Since last Friday, Deen has also been dropped by pork producer Smithfield Foods Inc and Food Network, owned by Scripps Network Interactive Inc, home of Deen’s cooking shows. Home-shopping network QVC, owned by Liberty Media Corp , has taken a wait-and-see approach with Deen, saying it was putting a “pause” on her involvement with the network. Sears Holdings Corp, which stocks Deen’s products, said on Thursday it was still deciding the future of the partnership. “Now she’s going to be given an opportunity down the road ... to rebuild and retool,” NPD Group’s Cohen said. “She may never get (her brand) back to the same level, but there’s enough people who will sympathize with her.” QVC said in its statement that “People deserve second chances.” Some companies that have partnered with Deen have stood behind her, including Landies Candies and Sandridge Food Corp, which said it is “proud to provide unwavering support for Paula Deen.” Deen’s comeback may come down to her loyal fans, many of whom have come out in force on social media to voice their support, some threatening in Facebook and Twitter posts to boycott the companies dropping the chef. “The consumers have a very short memory ... in a few years from now, no one is going to remember what Paula Deen did,” Cohen said. “American consumers are very forgiving and very forgetful.”",6272013,http://www.reuters.com/article/people-pauladeen-sponsorships/celebrity-chef-paula-deen-loses-more-deals-but-book-sales-soar-idUSL2N0F31OS20130627

The contract with Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical company, came in 2012 after she revealed that she had been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. As spokeswoman for the maker of diabetes care and equipment she would earn an estimated $6 million over three years, according to Forbes. The company said in a statement that it had “mutually agreed” with Deen to suspend her partnership with the company “while she takes time to focus her attention where it is needed.” Deen’s merchandising deals, which include cookware, homeware and books, have an estimated value of about $7 million, according to Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst for market researcher The NPD Group. Cohen also estimated Deen’s food and restaurant branding deals added another $6 million to $7 million to her empire. Retail giants Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target and Home Depot Inc all cut ties with Deen within 24 hours of her “Today Show” appearance. “We have made a decision to phase out the Paula Deen merchandise in our stores as well as on Target.com,” Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said in a statement. “Once the merchandise is sold out, we will not be replenishing inventory.” Since last Friday, Deen has also been dropped by pork producer Smithfield Foods Inc and Food Network, owned by Scripps Network Interactive Inc, home of Deen’s cooking shows. Home-shopping network QVC, owned by Liberty Media Corp, has taken a wait-and-see approach with Deen, saying it was putting a “pause” on her involvement with the network. Sears Holdings Corp, which stocks Deen’s products, said on Thursday it was still deciding the future of the partnership. “Now she’s going to be given an opportunity down the road ... to rebuild and retool,” NPD Group’s Cohen said. “She may never get (her brand) back to the same level, but there’s enough people who will sympathize with her.” QVC said in its statement that “People deserve second chances.” Some companies that have partnered with Deen have stood behind her, including Landies Candies and Sandridge Food Corp, which said it is “proud to provide unwavering support for Paula Deen.” Deen’s comeback may come down to her loyal fans, many of whom have come out in force on social media to voice their support, some threatening in Facebook and Twitter posts to boycott the companies dropping the chef. “The consumers have a very short memory ... in a few years from now, no one is going to remember what Paula Deen did,” Cohen said. “American consumers are very forgiving and very forgetful.” ",6282013,http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-pauladeen-sponsorships/celebrity-chef-paula-deen-loses-more-deals-but-book-sales-soar-idUSBRE95R00A20130628
266,TGT,Target Stores co-founder dies at 88,"(Reuters) - Douglas Dayton, the man who helped start Target Corp (TGT.N) as a family-owned department store in 1961 and turned it into one of the largest discount retail chains in the United States, has died at the age of 88. Praise for Dayton, who left Target in 1974 to set up a venture capital firm and retired in 1994, came on Sunday from Target as well as businessmen and politicians including his nephew, Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton. “Along with his brothers and cousin, Doug was instrumental in helping to guide the strategic direction of Dayton Hudson Corporation for many years and institutionalize the values that are at the heart of Target Corporation today,” Minneapolis-based Target said in a statement. Douglas Dayton became Target’s first president in 1961, and when the company merged with department store chain J.L. Hudson Co in 1969 he became senior vice president. The new company, called Dayton Hudson Corporation, was renamed Target in 2000. Dayton is survived by his wife Wendy, his four children and six grandchildren. Most of the former Dayton department stores in Minnesota are today operated by Macy’s Inc (M.N) but Target now ranks 36th among the Fortune 500 companies.

267,TGT,UPDATE 1-North American group sets Bangladesh factory safety plan,"* 17-member alliance includes Wal-Mart, Gap, Target, VF Corp * 500 factories to be inspected, have worker training in 1st year By Jessica Wohl and Doug Palmer CHICAGO/WASHINGTON, July 10 (Reuters) - North American retailers unveiled a five-year safety plan for Bangladesh garment factories on Wednesday that would include inspecting within a year every factory they use, following tragedies such as April’s deadly garment building collapse. The North American plan was immediately criticized by groups that think a European-led plan is stronger. The plan announced in Washington, D.C. by the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which includes 17 retailers and apparel companies, comes after 1,129 workers were killed in the collapse of a Bangladesh garment plant in April, and another 112 people perished in a fire at a Bangladesh factory in November. A larger number of mainly European retailers that have signed what is known as the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh announced a similar plan on Monday.  Both plans include factory inspections, worker training and ways for workers to report safety concerns. The two groups also agreed not to use factories considered to be unsafe. Members of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility and long-term shareholders in apparel brands and retailers said the Alliance’s plan lacks sufficient worker protections and accountability mechanisms and called it a weaker alternative to the European-led accord. European unions involved in the other accord, industriALL and UNI Global Union, called the North American alliance “another toothless” auditing program. “This initiative is not serious,” said Tom Grinter, a spokesman for industriALL. More than four million people, mostly women, work in Bangladesh’s clothing sector, making it the second-largest global apparel exporter behind China. The North American alliance plans to inspect the more than 500 factories its members get garments from within a year, while the European-led accord plans to have initial inspections at the factories its 70 members use within the next nine months. “I think both plans are very strong and that we should work together going forward,” said Jay Jorgensen, Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s global chief compliance officer. “Theirs doesn’t recognize the way the U.S. legal system works, which is why the vast majority here in the U.S. didn’t join.” One of the main concerns North American parties had with the European-led accord was the use of a binding arbitration process that would be enforceable in the courts of the country where a company is domiciled. Binding arbitration typically restricts the ability of the parties involved to appeal any decision in court. North American alliance members will be held legally accountable to the group. If they do not do the work they agreed to do, the board can kick members out, their funds will be kept by the alliance and companies can arbitrate to get back in, said Jorgensen, a member of the alliance’s nine-member board of directors. Daniel Duty, Target Corp’s vice president of global affairs who is also on the alliance’s board, said that between the efforts of the alliance and the accord, the groups should be able to cover the majority of the factories in Bangladesh, more than the 500 the North American alliance plans to inspect. Bangladesh’s Ambassador to the United States Akramul Qader welcomed the North American plan and said he was “glad that alliance members have expressed (their) intention to collaborate with the EU-based accord on fire and building safety.” He also expressed hope the United States would quickly restore trade benefits that were suspended in late June because of the poor safety conditions in Bangladesh. The U.S. decision set duties on about $35 million worth of ceramics, golf equipment, tobacco products and other goods from Bangladesh that previously entered the United States duty free. The U.S. move does not directly affect Bangladesh’s multi-billion-dollar clothing exports, since garments are not eligible for U.S. duty-free treatment. So far, $42 million has been raised for the North American project. Companies will contribute up to $1 million a year for five years based on how much they produce in Bangladesh. Ten percent of the funds will be set aside to assist workers temporarily displaced by factory improvements or if a factory closes for safety reasons. The money will also support a non-governmental organization to be chosen within 30 days that will implement parts of the program. The North American alliance’s plan, called the Bangladesh Worker Safety Initiative, was developed with assistance from former U.S. Senators George Mitchell and Olympia Snowe, who acted as independent facilitators at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington-based think thank. The alliance has asked Mitchell and Snowe to verify the effectiveness of the program over at least the first two years. The 17 current members of the alliance include: Canadian Tire Corp Ltd ; Carter’s Inc ; The Children’s Place Retail Stores Inc ; Gap Inc ; Hudson’s Bay Co ; IFG Corp; J.C. Penney Co Inc ; Jones Group Inc ; Kohl’s Corp ; L. L. Bean Inc; Macy’s Inc  ; Nordstrom Inc ; Public Clothing Co; Sears Holdings Corp ; Target; VF Corp ; and Wal-Mart. Hong Kong sourcing company Li & Fung Ltd, which does business with many of the companies involved, is serving as an adviser. Additional members are expected to join. The North American alliance’s plan is also being backed by the American Apparel & Footwear Association, Canadian Apparel Federation, National Retail Federation, Retail Council of Canada, Retail Industry Leaders Association, and the United States Association of Importers of Textiles & Apparel.",7102013,http://www.reuters.com/article/bangladesh-factories-northamerica/update-1-north-american-group-sets-bangladesh-factory-safety-plan-idUSL1N0FG0S220130710
268,TGT,Loblaw to buy Shoppers in C$12.4 billion bid to defend turf,"(Reuters) - Loblaw Cos Ltd (L.TO), Canada’s largest food retailer, announced a C$12.4 billion ($11.9 billion) deal on Monday to buy Shoppers Drug Mart Corp SC.TO, the country’s biggest pharmacy chain, to bulk up against intensifying competition. News of the tie-up, Canada’s biggest merger deal so far this year, sent Shoppers shares soaring 26 percent to just under the C$61.54 per share price offered by Loblaw. Loblaw shares rose more than 9 percent at one point as investors welcomed the prospect of cost savings and increased scale. Loblaw and parent George Weston Ltd (WN.TO) have been under increasing pressure from long-time foreign rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), which has ramped up its grocery offerings. Newer entrant Target Corp (TGT.N), which offers a smaller selection of groceries, opened its first 24 Canadian stores in March and plans to have 124 stores across the country by yearend. And local rival Empire Co Ltd (EMPa.TO) last month said it was acquiring Safeway Inc’s Canadian assets for $5.7 billion, cementing its position as Canada’s No. 2 grocer. “We think the deal was a long time coming ... Shoppers Drug Mart was a sitting duck,” said Barry Schwartz, a portfolio manager at Baskin Financial Services, which owns some 140,000 shares of Shoppers. “I think the Empire-Safeway transaction lit a fire under Loblaws to make a deal.” Loblaw, which opened its first store in Toronto 94 years ago and now operates more than 1,000 corporate and franchised stores in Canada, is owned by Toronto’s billionaire Weston family, repeatedly ranked as the country’s second wealthiest. Starting with a bakery in Toronto, the Westons’ empire now includes Selfridges and Fortnum & Mason in Britain as well as upscale retailers Holt Renfrew in Canada and Brown Thomas in Ireland. Galen Weston, Loblaw’s executive chairman, told reporters he and Shoppers Drug Mart Chairman Holger Kluge brokered the cash-and-stock deal last week during a drive along a country road. Loblaw said the acquisition would create a combined retail operation with more than C$42 billion in annual revenue. Loblaw had C$31.6 billion in revenue in 2012. Several analysts said this would make Loblaw the country’s biggest retailer by revenue. The deal would give Loblaw increased exposure to pharmaceutical sales, which are expected to benefit from the aging of Canada’s population. It would also gain a foothold in the market for smaller stores serving dense urban neighborhoods. While Loblaw has pharmacies in some of its stores, the executives said the acquisition would catapult the company into a position that would otherwise take decades to achieve. “For me it demonstrates Loblaw’s desire to really set the agenda in Canada,” said Stewart Samuel, an analyst at food and grocery researcher IGD. He estimated Wal-Mart’s Canadian sales at about half the combined revenue of Loblaw and Shoppers. Wal-Mart declined to comment. The combination is expected to yield annual cost savings of C$300 million by the third year, Loblaw said. Canada’s Competition Bureau said it will review the proposal, but could not specify how long it will take. The companies expect the deal to close within six or seven months. “We believe the Canadian retail space is as competitive - if not more so - than any place in the world,” Loblaw’s Weston told reporters. “You’ve got ... the most compelling and aggressive international retailers in mass merchandising space in Canada, growing this year at a rate that is faster than at any time in Canadian history.” Loblaw and Shoppers executives said they do not foresee having to sell substantial assets to meet regulatory requirements, and said the transaction would not significantly change market share in their food and pharmacy businesses. “The center of gravity of Shoppers is health-related ... whereas the center of gravity at Loblaws is food and other grocery products, but there is some overlap,” said Anthony Baldanza, a partner at Fasken Martineau and chairman of the law firm’s antitrust and competition group. “The issues presented by the overlap should be manageable.” Loblaw’s offer of C$61.54 in cash and stock represents a 27 percent premium to Shoppers Drug Mart’s closing price on Friday. Before the deal was announced, Loblaw shares had climbed about 47 percent in the past year, while Shoppers shares had risen roughly 17 percent. Shoppers Drug Mart shareholders will own about 29 percent of the combined company. Shoppers Drug Mart will retain its name and brand and will operate as a separate division of Loblaw. While the deal carries a substantial C$300 million break fee, Baskin’s Schwartz said many U.S. pharmacy chains and retailers would now be studying whether a rival bid is feasible. There may be interest because building a competing pharmacy chain to Shoppers from the ground up would be nearly impossible, he said. About C$5.7 billion, or 46 percent of the cost of the deal, will be covered by the issue of Loblaw shares, the companies said. George Weston Ltd (WN.TO), Loblaw’s biggest shareholder, will buy an additional C$500 million in Loblaw shares to help finance a the deal. The C$6.7 billion cash portion of the deal will be financed with about C$2 billion of Loblaw and Shoppers cash on hand, and more than C$4 billion in debt financing.

271,TGT,Target's new baby section takes aim at specialty shops' service,"(Reuters) - Target Corp is testing a baby section with trained staff at 10 Illinois stores in a push to gain a bigger share of the shrinking but highly competitive market for baby gear. The U.S. birthrate has declined in recent years, intensifying competition among mass merchants such as Target, specialty shops led by Toys R Us Inc’s Babies R Us and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc’s buybuy BABY, and websites including Amazon.com Inc and its diapers.com site. For Target, trying to do a better job satisfying new parents could lead to higher sales over time. Households with children spend about 20 percent more each year at Target than patrons without children, said Trish Adams, Target’s senior vice president of merchandising. “We kind of are a store for families, and particularly young families, and we just think there is further opportunity to capture a larger share of their wallet,” she said. The Target test stores feature the same products, but the redesigned baby areas will operate a bit more like specialty shops, with trained staff members assisting shoppers. Other changes could come as Target does more research, Adams said. One reason for the stiff competition is that the U.S. birthrate has declined. There were 63.2 births per 1,000 women in 2012, in line with 2011 and down from 69.3 births per 1,000 women in 2007, according to Centers for Disease Control. The decline in fertility that began in 2008 is closely linked to the weakened economy, the Pew Research Center said in 2011. Still, people do not tend to trade down when buying for babies, and the rise of dual-income households and having children later in life means that parents have more disposable income for those purchases, said Pat Conroy, vice chairman and head of the consumer products group at consulting firm Deloitte. Companies have brought out everything from designer diapers and easier-to-feed foods to sportier strollers and baby monitors with color video screens as they try to push parents to spend more. Sales of baby goods such as cribs, carriers and car seats rose to about $2.8 billion in 2011 from $2.7 billion in 2010, according to data released this month by the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association. The majority of those sales come from mass merchants, discount chains and specialty shops, with just 11 percent purchased online, it said. U.S. sales of diapers and training pants, however, fell 0.3 percent to nearly $5.38 billion in 2012, the third straight year such sales declined, according to Euromonitor International. It expects such sales to fall again in 2013 and then rise through 2017. Specialty shops try to entice new parents with everything from breast-feeding classes to exclusive goods to fend off pressure from other retailers. The baby category is “very, very competitive” and Babies R Us must prove that what it offers is so compelling “that we don’t have to worry about what other people necessarily are up to,” Richard Barry, merchandising officer for Toys R Us Chief, said. He declined to discuss the company’s market share. Target does not plan to offer classes at its stores. For now, the test stores have trained staff members on baby products available during busy shopping times to help shoppers. Content from Johnson & Johnson’s BabyCenter is also loaded onto iPads in the baby area for product research. “Target is never going to have the breadth of assortment that some of the specialists can have,” but adding trained staff “could result in increased shopper activity and purchases in the Target store,” said Sandra Skrovan, research director for Planet Retail U.S. ",7312013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-target-baby/targets-new-baby-section-takes-aim-at-specialty-shops-service-idUSBRE96U16S20130731
272,TGT,Canada's Metro to operate Target's pharmacies in Quebec,"(Reuters) - Canadian supermarket operator Metro Inc (MRU.TO) will partner with Target Corp (TGT.N) to operate the U.S. retailer’s in-store pharmacies in Quebec, a month after Loblaw Cos Ltd (L.TO), Canada’s largest grocer, said it would buy Shopper’s Drug Mart SC.TO. Metro’s Brunet pharmacies will carry Target-owned brands in majority of Target stores in Quebec and provide prescription, pharmacy and health consultation services, the companies said. These deals underscore the increasing appetite of Canadian grocers for the pharmacy business as prescription drugs give them higher margins to offset the relatively low returns on basic food staples. Loblaw said last month it would buy Shopper’s Drug Mart for C$12.4 billion ($11.99 billion). “The agreement with Target provides an excellent growth opportunity for Metro’s pharmaceutical division ... as it enables us to significantly increase our presence, our purchasing power and our sales potential in Quebec,” Metro Chief Executive Eric La Flèche said in a statement. Minneapolis-based Target said it expects to open its first 25 stores in Quebec this fall. An increasing presence of U.S. companies have sent home-grown retailers scrambling to bulk up assets to fend off competition. Metro, one of the few retailers that has not been part of an acquisition this year, operates a network of food and drug stores in Quebec and Ontario under banners such as Adonis and Brunet. Metro said it would open 18 Brunet franchisee stores across Quebec by the summer of 2014. Metro also said it would reorganize its Ontario store network over the next few months that will affect some 15 stores. The company will take a related charge of about C$40 million in the fourth quarter. Metro’s net earnings rose to C$149.8 million, or C$1.55 per share in the third quarter, from C$144.4 million, or C$1.43 per share, a year earlier. Higher competition weighed on sales in the quarter ended July 6, Metro said. Revenue fell about 1 percent to C$3.57 billion and same-store sales, a key measure for retailers, fell 0.9 percent.

274,TGT,Target blames Canada and cautious shoppers as it warns on year,"(Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) warned of weak annual sales and profits on Wednesday as U.S. shoppers remain cautious and its new Canadian stores are not doing as well as anticipated. Shares of Target fell as much as 4.1 percent to $65.14, their lowest level since March, and were down 3 percent in later trading. The chain, which competes against Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and other discount retailers with a mix of basic goods, apparel and accessories, posted a second-quarter profit just ahead of expectations while sales missed estimates. Target said this year’s profit should come in at the low end of already reduced expectations and that sales at stores open at least a year should grow just 1 percent rather than 2 to 2.5 percent, as U.S. shoppers remain cautious in the face of ongoing household budget pressures such as higher taxes and gasoline prices. At the same time, the Canadian business is costing more than Target anticipated and will weigh on full-year profit. Target opened its first Canadian stores in March after announcing its plans in early 2011. That gave Target time to remodel the stores it bought from Zellers, hire and train thousands of employees and set up its supply chain, but it also gave competitors time to step up their efforts. “The competitors have really done a good job in defending their space,” said Stewart Samuel, program director at IGD Canada, pointing in particular to Wal-Mart, Loblaw Cos Ltd (L.TO) and Shoppers Drug Mart Corp SC.TO. Target said it needs to do a better job of advertising low prices on basic goods such as healthcare and food items that bring shoppers in often. Expenses from Target’s Canadian operation cut 21 cents per share from quarterly profit, 5 cents more than it forecast. It expects its Canadian expenses to reduce this year’s earnings by 82 cents per share, up from a previous forecast of 45 cents. “It’s definitely gotten off to a slower start than the company expected,” said Shawn Kravetz, president of Esplanade Capital LLC, which owns Target shares. Target has 68 Canadian stores and plans for 124 by the end of the year. In the United States, which remains Target’s main market by far, shoppers are visiting less often. Consumer spending on homes and cars is crowding out other spending, and income growth remains weak, said Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel. A handful of retailers such as TJX Cos Inc (TJX.N) along with home improvement chains have shown strength but “the rest of retail is sluggish at best,” said Kravetz at Esplanade Capital. “Wal-Mart and others made it crystal clear that it is a little bit tougher out there, so that shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone.” Separately, Walmart U.S. said its holiday layaway program that starts in mid-September will now be free as it gets rid of an opening fee. Layaway allows a customer to keep a product on hold at the store and pay for it over time and is also being used by chains such as Sears Holding Corp’s (SHLD.O) Kmart and by Toys R Us TOYS.UL, but not by Target. Cowen & Co analyst Faye Landes called Walmart’s layaway announcement “a shot across the bow to its competitors, and one that clearly signals intensifying competition ahead of the all-important 2013 holiday shopping season.” Data from an Ipsos poll conducted for Reuters from August 15 to August 19 showed 13 percent of respondents said they were buying more items on layaway this year than last year. “Our customers are feeling the pinch and they are watching every penny today,” Walmart U.S. Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer Duncan Mac Naughton said on Wednesday. In May, Target, noting that shoppers were sticking to shopping lists, trimmed its fiscal-year adjusted earnings per share forecast to a range of $4.70 to $4.90 from $4.85 to $5.05. It now expects a profit near the low end of that range. Target earned $611 million, or 95 cents per share, in the fiscal second quarter ended August 3, down from $704 million, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier. Including the effects from opening Canadian stores but excluding other items, Target earned 97 cents per share, one penny more than analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Second-quarter sales rose 4 percent to $17.12 billion, missing the analysts’ target of $17.26 billion. Target’s same-store sales rose 1.2 percent, below analysts’ estimate of a 2.1 percent increase and its own forecast of a 2 percent to 3 percent gain. Last week, Walmart U.S. posted a 0.3 percent decline in such sales and said they were likely to be flat this quarter.

277,TGT,"Analysis: Spending on cars, homes threatens apparel sales as holidays approach","(Reuters) - Even with consumer confidence at a six-year high, retailers ranging from Target Corp (TGT.N) to Macy’s Inc (M.N) are competing not only with each other but are also having to adapt to shifting spending patterns. Many consumers are taking advantage of still-low interest rates, purchasing cars and houses, but at the same time they are holding back on shirts, dresses and shoes, which doesn’t bode well for many retailers in the run-up to the year-end holiday season. “People are putting their money into things that will last,” said Jill Puleri, IBM’s global industry leader for retail. “If you look at appliances, if you look at jewelry, these are not necessarily small purchases. They’re rewarding each other ... They’re putting money where things are more stable.” IBM expects U.S. appliance sales to rise 6 percent in the current third quarter, with sales of other home goods up 1.67 percent. For the holiday season, it expects appliance sales to rise 2.13 percent and sales of home goods to rise 1.98 percent, while anticipating the steepest decline, 3.62 percent, in men’s apparel. That’s good news for companies such as home improvement chains Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N), which reported strong quarterly results and raised their fiscal year forecasts as people spruced up their homes. In contrast, Macy’s, Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Target Corp (TGT.N) and even luxury chains such as Saks Inc SKS.N and Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) posted disappointing second-quarter sales in recent weeks, and many aren’t hopeful about the holidays. “As people are spending more money on their cars and homes, they are cutting back elsewhere, such as their spending on items like clothes and shoes,” Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O) Chairman and Chief Executive Edward Lampert told Reuters in an interview. Macy’s, which gets about 80 percent of sales from clothing, lowered its sales forecast for the year after it noticed spending shifting away from what department store chains offer. “The problem now is that there is no fashion, and if there is no newness, clothing becomes a commodity,” said Patty Edwards, chief investment officer of Trutina Financial, which sold Nordstrom earlier this year, but owns Michael Kors Holdings Ltd (KORS.N), PVH Corp (PVH.N) and Nike Inc (NKE.N). “Beyond a select few, I’d think twice about getting into apparel and retail stocks.” Some of the biggest hedge funds are shifting out of the sector. An analysis of holdings in the most recent quarter of the top 30 hedge funds by Thomson Reuters shows consumer discretionary stocks suffered the third biggest decline in the period, falling 2.15 percent. Only energy and materials had larger declines, at 5.25 and 11.59, respectively. The research shows that money shifted into healthcare, telecoms and technology stocks. While interest rates have risen sharply in the last few months, they remain low by historical standards, and many consumers are opting to buy now ahead of any potential increase. “Consumers recognize that financed purchases will be more expensive with rising rates, and thus are prioritizing them in the current economy,” said Erich Patten, portfolio manager at Cutler Investment Group LLC in Seattle. “Demand for soft goods will return as interest rates rise and purchasing patterns normalize.” Since early May, mortgage rates for 30-year loans have risen more than a percentage point. U.S. home resales jumped in July to their highest level in over three years, and some of that surge may reflect buyers rushing to lock in rates before they rise further. Still, data showed that sales of new, single-family homes plunged to their lowest level in nine months last month, casting a shadow over the U.S. housing recovery. Auto sales to U.S. consumers beat expectations in July and major automakers reported low inventories for many hot-selling models, suggesting sales would strengthen further. The near-term spending in housing and automotive sectors “is crowding out other spending,” Target Corp (TGT.N) Chairman and CEO Gregg Steinhafel said on an August 21 call. He said that his chain sees “a mix of signals in which emerging optimism is balanced with continuing challenges.” Consumers are also feeling the pinch of payroll taxes that are 2 percentage points higher this year, as well as slightly higher gas prices, leading them to cut back on discretionary items. “You can’t get out of paying your taxes and you have to have gas to go to work and school. Those are real numbers that really do impact real Americans, and I think that’s where other discretionary spend takes a hit,” said Alison Paul, vice chairman and U.S. retail and distribution leader at Deloitte LLP. According to a poll of 1,100 U.S. consumers by Ipsos for Reuters this month, 26 percent plan to spend less on clothing this holiday season, while only 12 percent say they expect to spend more. A few retailers, including Ann Inc ANN.N, posted a rise in quarterly comparable store sales this week. “We’re not saying run away from apparel,” said Shawn Kravetz, president of Esplanade Capital. “We’re saying you have to make sure it really looks good on you. Investors just have to be choosier than ever because it has gotten very messy and very challenging very quickly.” ",8262013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-retail-spending-analysis/analysis-spending-on-cars-homes-threatens-apparel-sales-as-holidays-approach-idUSBRE97P0BX20130826

279,TGT,UPDATE 3-Tiffany's strong China sales offset tepid Americas business,"By Phil Wahba Aug 27 (Reuters) - Tiffany & Co’s strong sales in China and higher prices made up for some disappointing business in its home market in the latest quarter, leading the U.S. jeweler on Tuesday to raise its profit forecast for the year. There were fears this summer that luxury spending in China might slow as the economy there weakened, but Tiffany is the latest Western brand to report good sales there. Prada SpA  and Coach Inc recently posted big gains in the world’s fastest-growing market for luxury goods. Sales at stores open at least a year in Asia, except for Japan, rose 13 percent in the second quarter ended July 31, helped largely by China. But same-store sales were unchanged in the Americas, which is still Tiffany’s biggest market. This suggests the company may have faced the same summer pullback by U.S. shoppers that dented sales at chains ranging from Saks Inc to Target Corp . “Business in the Americas is light,” said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough. Tiffany continues to struggle with low-end jewelry sales, he added. Tiffany executives told analysts on a conference call that tourists’ purchases had helped business tick up at the Fifth Avenue flagship in New York, which generates about one-eighth of sales. Elsewhere, though, there was still reason to be prudent, they said. “We are maintaining a cautious sales outlook for the Americas until we see solid evidence of an upturn,” Chief Financial Officer Patrick McGuiness said. Shares of Tiffany rose 0.1 percent to $81.75 in morning trading. An Ipsos poll conducted for Reuters earlier this month found 35 percent of Americans planned to spend less on jewelry in the 2013 holiday season, while only 5 percent expected to spend more. Tiffany said it still expected net sales worldwide to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage rate for the year, including the effect of the strong dollar. The company has struggled to find the right mix of the expensive jewelry for which it is known and the more-affordable silver items, typically less than $500, that generate 25 percent of sales and comprise its most profitable category. Still, the pickup in business outside the Americas, where Tiffany is focusing its expansion, reassured Wall Street that the jeweler’s growth prospects remain good, Yarbrough said. Sales in Asia outside Japan now account for about 22 percent of overall revenue, compared with 11 percent five years ago. The company, famed for its robin’s egg blue boxes, said global sales rose 4.4 percent to $925.9 million in the second quarter, below the $941.4 million analysts were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales growth would have been 8 percent if not for the strong U.S. dollar, which reduces the value of goods sold overseas. Same-store sales climbed 5 percent, in line with estimates.  Excluding currency fluctuations, they were up 7 percent in Europe and 8 percent in Japan. Despite strong demand for high-end jewelry in Japan, overall sales there fell 14 percent because of the weak yen. Second-quarter net income rose to $106.8 million, or 83 cents per share, from $91.8 million, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier. Per-share profit beat the average Wall Street estimate by 9 cents, helped by lower pressure from diamond and gold costs. Tiffany said price increases in some categories had not deterred shoppers. The company now expects a profit of $3.50 to $3.60 per share for the full fiscal year, up 7 cents from its previous forecast range. Last year, Tiffany’s shares came under attack after it repeatedly lowered its forecasts.",8272013,http://www.reuters.com/article/tiffany-results/update-3-tiffanys-strong-china-sales-offset-tepid-americas-business-idUSL2N0GS0CS20130827
280,TGT,WRAPUP 2-Canadian banks' shares rise as profits top estimates,"* Profits at Royal Bank, TD Bank, CIBC top estimates * Domestic lending drives the profit beats * Wholesale banking a weak spot * TD, Royal Bank boost dividends * Shares of all three banks rise, TD hits record high   (Adds comments from TD CEO and from a fund manager, details on TD branch plans in the United States) By Cameron French TORONTO, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Three of Canada’s biggest banks posted better than expected quarterly results on Thursday, pushing their shares higher as surprisingly strong retail lending and wealth-management income offset weakness in trading and investment banking. Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank , the country’s top two banks, both announced dividend hikes, while No. 5 lender Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce   said it would buy back as much as 2 percent of its stock over the next 12 months. The results close out a financial third-quarter reporting season in which Canada’s top six banks all exceeded market earnings estimates on the back of domestic lending profits that churned higher despite predictions that a cooling housing market would slow growth to a trickle. “These aren’t ‘knocking out of the park’ numbers, but they are better than my expectations,” said Tom Lewandowski, a St. Louis-based analyst for Edward Jones. While loan growth has slowed slightly over the past year as the country’s housing market has begun to cool, it has not slowed to the extent feared by many analysts. And while rock-bottom mortgage rates have pressured lending margins, the banks have been able to blunt the impact by refocusing on higher-margin businesses, such as credit cards and auto lending. The results also affirm the wisdom of recent efforts by the banks to diversify their revenue bases. TD, for instance, had a  profit surge at its U.S. retail banking unit, while RBC was buoyed by strong results from its wealth management division, which it has been expanding, particularly in Europe. Excluding a favorable income tax adjustment and other small items, RBC earned C$1.48 a share, topping analysts’ estimates of C$1.38, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. TD’s profit excluding items was also better than expected at C$1.65 a share versus a market forecast of C$1.55. CIBC’s earnings per share, excluding items, were C$2.29, ahead of expectations of C$2.15. TD shares ended up 2.7 percent at C$89.93, and hit a record high of C$90.54 during the session. RBC rose 1.2 percent to C$65.24, and CIBC gained 2.8 percent to C$82.66. The Canadian banking sector has largely traded sideways in recent months as some investors have opted for U.S. bank stocks, which were slow to rebound from the 2008 financial crisis and are now seen by some as a recovery play. Tim Johal, a portfolio manager at Investors Group, said the U.S. banks may offer better returns as they recover, but that Canadian banks were still appealing at current levels. “These banks are still cheap relative to the profitability that they are able to generate and relative to the consistent earnings that they are able to produce,” he said. RBC raised its quarterly dividend 6 percent to 67 Canadian cents, while TD boosted its payout by 5 percent to 85 Canadian cents a share. On a net basis, RBC earned C$2.30 billion ($2.19 billion), or C$1.52 a share, in the quarter ended July 31, compared with C$2.24 billion, or C$1.47 a share, a year earlier. Earnings at RBC’s retail bank climbed 7 percent to C$1.2 billion, while wealth management income jumped 51 percent to C$236 million. Weighing on the result was the bank’s capital markets wing, where income slid 10 percent to C$388 million on lower investment banking activities and a drop in fixed-income trading revenue. Wholesale banking was also a weight for TD, which saw overall net profit decline due to a previously announced C$418 million insurance charge for higher provisions in its auto lending unit as well as losses from floods in Alberta and Ontario this summer. Net income fell 10 percent to C$1.53 billion, or C$1.58 a share, from C$1.70 billion, or C$1.78 a share, a year earlier. But TD’s retail bank earnings rose 13 percent to C$973 million in Canada and jumped 57 percent to C$445 million in the United States, helped by the acquisition earlier this year of Target Corp’s $5.9 billion U.S. credit card portfolio. Stymied by slim growth prospects in Canada, TD began building its U.S. bank from scratch in 2004 and now boasts about 1,300 branches spread along the Eastern Seaboard. However, TD, which has a goal of containing expense growth to 3 percent on the year, will close 33 U.S. branches in November and may consolidate other facilities to keep costs down, Chief Executive Ed Clark said on a conference call. “We still see 2014 as tough revenue year and we’re saying we’ve just got to go through every part of the company and say is there a way that we could do this for less and actually do better,” he said. Bank officials noted that the branch closures are in addition to the opening of 30 new branches this year in the United States and about 20 in 2014. CIBC’s net income rose 6 percent to C$890 million, or C$2.16 a share, from C$841 million, or C$2.00 a share, a year earlier. Much more domestically focused than RBC or TD, profit at CIBC’s retail and business banking division rose 7 percent to C$638 million, while wealth management profit jumped 34 percent to C$102 million.

Earnings at RBC’s retail bank climbed 7 percent to C$1.2 billion, helped by higher lending volumes and by the acquisition of Ally Financial Inc’s Canadian auto finance and deposit arm in February, a deal which nearly doubled the bank’s commercial auto lending business. Wealth management income jumped 51 percent to C$236 million. Weighing on the result was the bank’s capital markets wing, whose income slid 10 percent to C$388 million on lower investment banking activities and a drop in fixed-income trading revenue. RBC attributed the decline in part to market concerns ahead of the expected scaling back of monetary stimulus by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Wholesale banking was also a weight for TD, which saw overall net profit decline due to a previously announced C$418 million insurance charge for higher provisions in its auto lending unit as well as losses from floods in Alberta and Ontario during the summer. “Our wholesale quarter was a little bit softer, but all-in, the remainder of the business (outside of insurance) was very good,” Chief Financial Officer Colleen Johnston said in an interview. Net income fell 10 percent to C$1.53 billion, or C$1.58 a share, from C$1.70 billion, or C$1.78 a share, a year earlier.

282,TGT,UPDATE 1- Hudson's Bay sales up; to cut dividend after Saks deal closes,"TORONTO, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Retailer Hudson’s Bay Co  reported higher quarterly sales and a small adjusted profit on Thursday as robust demand for apparel at its Canadian namesake stores offset lower traffic at its Lord & Taylor chain in the United States. The company, which announced a deal in July to buy U.S. luxury chain Saks Inc for $2.4 billion, also said it would cut its quarterly dividend after the deal closes so that it can reduce debt faster. The acquisition is due to close by yearend. HBC stock edged down 5 Canadian cents to C$17, exactly the same share price as in its November 2012 initial public offering, with 10 months of high volatility in between. Hudson’s Bay said sales at Lord & Taylor stores open for at least a year declined 1.2 percent, while same-store sales at its Hudson’s Bay stores in Canada climbed 6.2 percent. Faced with increasing competition from U.S. retailers looking to do business north of the border, HBC has been revamping its Canadian stores to boost revenue. It said a recently renovated Vancouver store had strong sales. “The Bay seems to be improving its performance, but I’m sure they’d like it to go much faster,” said Ed Strapagiel, a retail industry consultant based in Toronto. “They’ve renovated some stores, but they have a long way to go to get to where they want to be.” Hudson’s Bay, which is North America’s oldest corporation, had its roots in the Canadian fur trade, and it once controlled much of the land in the Canadian West. Its outlets in Canada now also offer branded goods from Lord & Taylor, whose flagship store is on Fifth Avenue, in central Manhattan. Adjusted to exclude certain nonrecurring items and charges, Hudson’s Bay earned C$3.9 million ($3.78 million), or 3 Canadian cents a share, in its second quarter, ended Aug. 3. In the year-before quarter it had an adjusted loss of C$2 million, or 2 Canadian cents a share. Sales rose 3.9 percent to C$947.7 million. The results were hit by a surge in financing costs related to the Saks acquisition. About C$60 million of the quarter’s total financing costs of about C$77 million were tied to the deal. The company said it would cut its dividend to 5 Canadian cents a share from 9.375 Canadian cents after the Saks deal closes. Strapagiel described Saks as a great brand, but added: “The question is whether HBC can turn it around quickly and start making money.” ",9122013,http://www.reuters.com/article/hudsonsbayco-results/update-1-hudsons-bay-sales-up-to-cut-dividend-after-saks-deal-closes-idUSL2N0H819B20130912
283,TGT,UPDATE 2-Sears Canada CEO resigns as retailer works on turnaround,"* COO Douglas Campbell to take over immediately * McDonald steps down to join unidentified international company * Shares fall as much as 2 pct Sept 24 (Reuters) - Sears Canada Inc Chief Executive Calvin McDonald has resigned just as the department store chain restructures amid intensifying competition from U.S. retailers such as Target Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc . Chief Operating Officer Douglas Campbell will become CEO with immediate effect, Sears Canada said, adding that McDonald is joining an international company it did not identify. The Globe and Mail newspaper, citing sources familiar with the situation, said McDonald’s departure was sparked by differing views with U.S. parent Sears Holdings, controlled by investor Edward Lampert. The disagreement was tied to “the pace at which capital was being deployed to keep the momentum of the transformation going,” the newspaper quoted the source as saying. Vincent Power, Sears Canada’s director of corporate communications, declined to comment directly on the reports. “I do not know of those differences...I say it is just speculation, it is nothing I comment on because it’s not facts that I am aware of,” Power told Reuters. Sears Canada, 51 percent owned by Sears Holdings Corp , announced a three-year plan in 2012 to reclaim lost market share that included making radical changes to its pricing strategies and sprucing up stores. The company posted its 18th quarterly fall in revenue in the second quarter. Sears Canada also closed two high-profile stores in the Toronto area and sold back the leases earlier this year. McDonald told Reuters in January that he was not entirely happy with the company’s progress in the 19 months since he took the top job. Power said he did not have the details on the company McDonald was joining, but it was an “exciting opportunity.” Campbell joined Sears Canada in March 2011 from Boston Consulting Group, where he led turnaround projects and was named COO last November. Shares of Sears Canada, which has a network of 181 corporate stores, fell as much as 2 percent to C$12.11 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

284,TGT,Target aims at online rivals with baby goods subscription plan,"Sept 25 (Reuters) - Target Corp will launch a free service on Wednesday that lets shoppers set up recurring deliveries of bulky baby goods, a move that mimics Amazon.com Inc and is aimed at attracting more moms. Target has a battle ahead since it is not the first to offer such delivery, and for now is only selling 150 items such as diapers, baby wipes and formula. “There are certainly other options in the marketplace and it’s one that they expect Target to have,” Casey Carl, Target’s president of multichannel, said in an interview. After shoppers told Target they wanted a recurring delivery service, the retailer decided to start with baby products since new mothers are an important group of customers for the retailer. It could expand into more categories, based on demand. The U.S. birthrate has declined in recent years, intensifying competition among mass merchants such as Target, specialty shops led by Toys R Us Inc’s Babies R Us and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc’s buybuy BABY as well as websites including Amazon.com and its Diapers.com unit. Target is the largest bricks-and-mortar retailer to offer a service dedicated to baby goods. For now, Target Subscriptions will not offer baby food.

285,TGT,"Target still confident about Canada, despite soft initial sales","TORONTO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - U.S. discount retail chain Target Corp said on Wednesday it expects to recover from initial stumbles in its ambitious push into Canada and still hit long-term growth targets. Canada is still key to Target’s growth over the next five years, executives said. While the company’s near-term outlook remained cautious, Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan said the retailer was expecting three to four percent total annual sales growth through 2017. It was also maintaining its long-term, 2017 earnings per share target of $8.00 and dividends per share of $3.00. Target, which will have 124 Canadian stores by the end of its grand opening year, said a shortfall in sales was the biggest issue in Canada. That shortfall, combined with additional investments to improve operations in Canada, is putting near-term pressure on earnings. Executives, speaking at a special meeting with analysts in Toronto, said it was investing in technology and other tools to help improve stocking and supply chains, a key complaint among Canadian shoppers, as well as changing customer perception on pricing. “2013 has been a year of milestones, learnings and challenges for the Target Canada team,” said Tony Fisher, president of Target Canada. “And while sales are below our initial expectations, our progress to date gives me a tremendous amount of confidence in our ability to meet our long-term goal of $6 billion in annual sales by 2017.” Fisher said Target was not satisfied with initial results, and that it was determined to have a strong holiday performance in the fourth quarter. Target, which is planning to open some 25 more Canadian stores by 2017, noted that some U.S. border stores have been impacted from the Canadian store openings.",10302013,http://www.reuters.com/article/target-meeting/target-still-confident-about-canada-despite-soft-initial-sales-idUSL1N0IJ2BM20131030
286,TGT,"Loblaw, Metro profits fall as competition intensifies","TORONTO (Reuters) - Two big Canadian grocers reported steep declines in quarterly profit on Wednesday in the face of escalating competition from the likes of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N), a new entrant to the Canadian market. Loblaw Cos Ltd (L.TO), Canada’s largest grocer, reported a 29 percent decline in profit for the September quarter and lowered its earnings outlook, while smaller rival Metro Inc (MRU.TO) reported a larger-than-expected 40 percent drop in profit. “The outlook is still very competitive. People are chasing sales at considerable expense. And we have to be careful between chasing those sales, spending too much money and not getting any returns,” Metro’s chief executive, Eric La Fleche, said. Stock of both grocers fell as much as 6 percent. Shares of rival Empire Co Ltd (EMPa.TO), which operates Sobeys stores, also fell, shedding more than 2.5 percent. Sobeys cemented its position as Loblaw’s closest rival earlier this year with a $5.7 billion deal for Safeway Inc’s SWY.N Canadian assets. Shortly after, Loblaw announced a C$12.4 billion ($11.82 billion) deal to buy Canada’s largest pharmacy chain, Shoppers Drug Mart SC.TO. Shoppers reported slightly lower quarterly net income on Tuesday, due in part to charges from the pending acquisition. Loblaw said profit was hurt by a later Thanksgiving holiday and a decline in sales at its drugstores. Canadian Thanksgiving is in October, more than a month ahead of the bigger U.S. holiday, while pharmacies are feeling the squeeze from regulatory changes that cap generic drug prices. It said start-up and other costs related to the spin-off of its real estate assets into a real estate investment trust, which was then taken public, Choice Properties (CHP_u.TO), and restructuring charges also dented profit. Toronto-based Loblaw cut its full-year earnings outlook due to higher-than-expected investments in store expansions and competitive pressure in certain food categories. “I’m disappointed ... we will not be able to deliver on the expectations we set last quarter,” said Loblaw Chief Financial Officer Sarah Davis. “The actual intensity we experienced in Q3 was greater than projected and caused actual performance to be below our expectations.” The grocer, which also owns the Joe Fresh clothing brand, expects flat 2013 operating income. In July, it forecast income would grow in the mid-single digits percentage-wise. It also said it was expecting marginal growth at established stores in the fourth quarter. In 2014, the company was forecasting the first half of the year to be more challenging than the second half. Montreal-based Metro, Canada’s No. 3 supermarket operator, said expanding U.S. retailers provided “intense competition,” especially in the populous province of Ontario. In response to the competition, Metro plans to invest nearly C$250 million ($240 million) in Ontario in 2014. “Overall, we view Metro’s results as disappointing ... and price investments will inevitably be required for Metro to defend its market position,” said BMO Capital Markets analyst Peter Sklar in a client note. Loblaw net income fell to C$154 million ($147 million), or 55 Canadian cents per share, during the third quarter, from C$217 million, or 77 Canadian cents per share, in the same period last year. Excluding certain one-time items, profit was 78 Canadian cents per share, falling short of analysts’ average estimates of 80 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue rose nearly 2 percent to C$10.01 billion, just short of analysts’ average forecast of C$10.04 billion. Sales at established stores, a key measure for retailers, climbed 0.4 percent. Loblaw shares were down 6 percent at C$44.99 late morning. Metro’s net earnings fell to C$83.6 million, or 88 Canadian cents a share, in its fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30 from C$145.1 million, or C$1.46 a share, a year earlier. Adjusted profit was C$1.19, below analysts’ average estimate of C$1.22. Sales fell nearly 9 percent to C$2.61 billion in the quarter, which had 12 weeks compared with 13 weeks the previous year, and same store sales were down 1.8 percent. Metro’s stock was down 5.3 percent at C$62.26, its lowest level since early February.

289,TGT,UPDATE 3-Wal-Mart's U.S. sales miss mark as shoppers stay cautious,"(Adds comments from media call, investor comment; updates share activity) By Phil Wahba Nov 14 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Thursday forecast a disappointing profit for the holiday season after reporting its third straight quarterly decline in U.S. comparable sales because of fewer shopper visits. The company said comparable sales at its U.S. stores, its biggest unit, fell 0.3 percent in the third quarter ended on Oct. 31, in part because of price reductions on televisions and sluggish sales of toys and packaged foods. Analysts had expected flat U.S. comparable sales, which include those online and at stores open at least a year. Business was also slower than expected at Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club chain and in key markets like Canada and Mexico, but the company’s e-commerce operation and small-format stores performed well. Shares of Wal-Mart were up 0.3 percent at $79.10 in midday trading. Even though business improved as the quarter progressed, Wal-Mart expects U.S. comparable sales to be flat during the current holiday quarter, which executives said would be “as competitive” as any in memory. Wal-Mart caters to lower-income customers, who have been reluctant to spend this year because of higher payroll taxes and slow job growth. The retailer and analysts do not expect that caution to abate this holiday period. “That low-end consumer is just not willing to step out and buy those discretionary items,” said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough. Kohl’s Corp, a mid-tier department store chain that serves a price-conscious clientele, said its comparable sales fell 1.6 percent last quarter, while Dillard’s Inc also reported disappointing sales. To kick-start U.S. sales, Wal-Mart in recent years has emphasized the expansion of its smaller-format stores and those that are closer to cities. Last month, the company said that in its next fiscal year, it would for the first time open more of those stores than the large supercenters for which it is best known. Wal-Mart said comparable sales at its fleet of smaller-format U.S. stores rose 3.4 percent last quarter. It currently has 300 such stores and plans to have 400 by year-end. Other positive signs for the company include a 40 percent increase in online sales, which Wal-Mart expects to reach $10 billion this year, or about 2.1 percent of its total. Apparel and home goods were among the company’s best performers last quarter. To compete against retailers such as Amazon.com Inc  and Target Corp, Wal-Mart began its holiday sales earlier than last year and is advertising more heavily. Walmart U.S. Chief Executive Officer Bill Simon told reporters that the company would also “invest” in prices, its term for cutting them. But some analysts were not convinced that would be enough. “Lowering prices no longer drives an offsetting increase in traffic which has been the lifeblood of Wal-Mart,” said Ken Murphy, a senior vice president at Standard Life Investments. Wal-Mart’s overall revenue increased 1.6 percent to $115.69 billion, while Wall Street was expecting $116.8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. International sales rose 4.1 percent to $34.4 billion, excluding any currency impact. Comparable sales fell in Mexico and Canada, but rose in Britain. In one encouraging sign for Walmart International, its operating income rose 9.2 percent despite tepid sales as it made progress in cutting costs. Same-store sales rose 1.1 percent at the company’s Sam’s Club chain, which has long lagged rival Costco Wholesale Corp . Analysts were expecting a gain of 1.3 percent. Third-quarter profit from continuing operations rose 2.8 percent to $3.73 billion, or $1.14 per share. That was 1 cent higher than analysts were expecting. The company forecast a profit of $1.60 to $1.70 per share for the current quarter, while Wall Street analysts were expecting $1.69, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Wal-Mart lowered its full-year forecast and now expects earnings of $5.11 to $5.21 per share, compared with an earlier outlook of $5.10 to $5.30. The company said it still expected sales to rise 3 percent to 5 percent in fiscal 2015, which begins in February.

290,TGT,"Dow ends above 16,000 for first time, boosted by data","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow industrials closed above 16,000 for the first time on Thursday as stocks rebounded from three days of weakness, after economic data pointed to a slowly improving labor market and subdued inflation. Financial shares led the market to its first day of gains after three sessions of losses. Although investors remain unsure about the timing of the Federal Reserve’s scaling back of its $85 billion per month in bond buying, some say the market will weather the eventual pullback in that stimulus. “I think the stock market will be on a rising track for the rest of the year,” said Margie Patel, senior portfolio manager at Wells Capital Management, at the Reuters Global Investment Summit on Thursday. “Everyone would like to see a correction” so they can add to positions, she said, adding that equities will be the strongest asset class in 2014, as well. Investors largely believe markets are due to pull back, even though the rally may continue, thanks to the Fed. The U.S. central bank has said repeatedly that it will not withdraw support until the economy can stand on its own. A combination of a growing economy and Fed support gives investors a good reason to buy stocks, Steven Einhorn, vice chairman of Omega Advisors, told the Summit. There is “a whole host of things the Fed can do to mitigate and moderate the sting” of a pullback in bond buying, Einhorn said. That includes more forward guidance for markets, which the members of the Federal Open Market Committee discussed during their most recent meeting, minutes released on Wednesday showed. The annual inflation rate is at 1 percent, below the Fed’s target of 2 percent. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and a voting member of the FOMC, said on Thursday that the inflation data gives the central bank some leeway to keep the current accommodative policy in place. “What we need to do is continue with the program for now as we have, but if an inflation problem starts to develop, we have to be willing to move to arrest that problem,” Bullard told a University of Arkansas event. “At that point, I’d put on my inflation hawk hat and spring into action.” Expectations that the Fed could start cutting stimulus - but without raising interest rates - have helped to widen the spread between long- and short-run debt. That benefits banks, which make money borrowing at short rates and lending at longer rates. Bank of America Inc (BAC.N) shares jumped 3 percent to close at $15.59. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI shot up 109.17 points, or 0.69 percent, to close at a record 16,009.99. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX gained 14.48 points, or 0.81 percent, to finish at 1,795.85. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC climbed 47.89 points, or 1.22 percent, to end at 3,969.16. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, while producer prices fell for a second straight month in October, indicating inflation pressures remain muted. “The (new claims) number we got this morning is very, very robust ... We’ve been handed a few one-two punches - the government shutdown, the payroll tax increase - but guess what, like Elton John, the economy is still standing,” said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Chase Private Client. Target (TGT.N) shares fell 3.5 percent to $64.19 after comparable sales rose less than expected in the third quarter and it lowered its full-year profit forecast. But the Morgan Stanley retail index .MVR rose 0.5 percent, buoyed by a 7.6 percent climb in Williams-Sonoma Inc (WSM.N) to $59.74. The upscale home products retailer reported quarterly results above estimates and said it was well-positioned for the holiday season.

292,TGT,"UPDATE 2-Target profit pinched by weak U.S. sales, Canadian expansion","(Adds investor quote, Canadian details, byline, updates stock price) By Phil Wahba Nov 21 (Reuters) - Discount chain Target Corp on Thursday blamed what it called “constrained” U.S. consumer spending for a tepid rise in quarterly comparable sales, and lowered its full-year profit forecast as a Canadian expansion proved costlier than expected. Shares fell 3.7 percent to $64 in premarket trading. Target competes most directly with Wal-Mart Stores Inc  and other discount retailers, which have all ramped up their promotions to win over reluctant U.S. shoppers. Last week, Walmart U.S. reported a small decline in comparable sales for its third quarter, and forecast no growth for the current quarter. It is starting holiday season sales earlier than ever to stave off rivals. “It is challenging for retailers because things are OK out there, they’re not good,” said Shawn Kravetz, president of investment firm Esplanade Capital, which owns Target shares. “So retailers are getting more aggressive. Everything’s a bit tighter.” An Ipsos poll for Reuters last week found more Americans were planning to spend less this holiday season than last year, and demanding big bargains. Target’s third-quarter comparable sales were up 0.9 percent, while analysts estimated a rise of 1.3 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Overall revenue rose 4 percent to $17.26 billion, below the Wall Street target of $17.36 billion. Target, which offers a mix of basic goods and trendy apparel and accessories, pared its full-year outlook in part because its Canadian expansion this year has take longer to pay off than expected. Target opened its first Canadian stores in March after announcing the plan in early 2011. The discounter expects its Canadian expenses to reduce this year’s earnings by between 95 cents and $1.05 per share, up from 82 cents previously. Canadian sales totaled $333 million in the quarter, but gross profit margin was 14.8 percent of sales as it cleared unsold inventory. By comparison, the U.S. gross margin was 30 percent. Target Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel said the company was more focused on improving its Canadian operations. The retailer said it was looking to earn an adjusted profit per share of $4.59 to $4.69, compared with an earlier range of $4.70 to $4.90. For the quarter ended Nov. 2, earnings fell to $341 million, or 54 cents per share, from $637 million, or 96 cents per share, a year earlier. “Consumer spending remains constrained” in the United States, Steinhafel said in a statement. Other retailers reported disappointing sales on Thursday.  Dollar Tree Inc said comparable sales rose a less-than-expected 3.1 percent, and Sears Holdings Corp  reported that U.S. comparable stores fell 4 percent. Abercrombie & Fitch Co, struggling with the defection of many teenage shoppers, forecast a double-digit percentage decline in comparable sales in the holiday quarter.

295,TGT,Analysis: Canada's cold shoulder to Target a cautionary tale,"TORONTO (Reuters) - U.S. retailers looking north in their quest for growth should consider the frosty reception Canada has so far given trendy discounter Target Corp a cautionary tale: what looks like a simple border crossing can easily go wrong. On the surface, Canada seems a good bet for retailers tiptoeing outside the United States, with Nordstrom and Saks among those now lined up to test the market. But winning over Canadians is no cake walk, and name recognition alone won’t do the trick. “The bottom line has to be the price,” said Peter Tong, a 38-year-old transit system designer who spends many lunch hours browsing at the Eaton Center mall in downtown Toronto, where a good number of U.S.-based retailers are located. The Black Friday sales there were “hyped up,” he said. At the JCrew store, a C$260 ($240) cashmere sweater is 30 percent off, but a quick check on Tong’s iPhone shows it sells for $200 at JCrew in the United States, with the same discount. “Why are we paying C$60 - and 13 percent taxes - on top?” Retailers underestimate the importance of pricing in Canada at their peril, and Target’s experiences are a case in point. Target had big plans for Canada earlier this year when it started opening the first of an unprecedented 124 stores in one year, along with three distribution centers. But it disappointed shoppers with prices above those it charges in the United States, and then with empty shelves as it miscalculated demand and struggled with managing inventory. Admitting it has had problems in its first international expansion, Target last month cut its full-year profit forecast, due largely to lower-than-expected sales in Canada. “Target had one thing that they had to accomplish...make the first shopping experience for every Canadian a positive one, and unfortunately, they failed at that,” said James Smerdon, vice president and director of retail consulting at Colliers International Consulting. The allure of Canada for U.S. retailers is that it is a market with fewer shopping centers than in the United States, less intense competition and relatively high sales volume. The Eaton Center and the Yorkdale Shopping Center, both in Toronto, for instance, boast North American-leading sales of around C$1,300 per square foot. “Part of the strength of U.S. retailers that are coming to Canada is that there is brand recognition,” said Yorkdale general manager Anthony Casalanguida. “There exists that pent-up demand because of the fact that Canadian shoppers know what these retailers are all about.” Yorkdale is already home to such high-end retailers as Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co, and Casalanguida advises new arrivals to consider their pricing carefully because Canadians are keen comparison shoppers. He said many U.S. retailers at the mall, including Ann Taylor and White House/Black Market, are matching U.S. prices. That may cut into margins, but it stokes sales. An estimated three-quarters of Canadians live just 160 kilometers (100 miles) from the U.S. border. Cross-border shopping and new relaxed duty-free rules create brand familiarity and high expectations. The next wave of U.S. newcomers will be led by luxury retailer Nordstrom Inc, whose Canadian president, Karen McKibbin, acknowledges some prices will have to be higher in Canada due to taxes and duties. She says Nordstrom will try to minimize such cases and won’t be a “Nordstrom-lite” that will disappoint shoppers. Nordstrom will open the first of five Canadian stores next year, and may open 15 to 20 lower-cost Rack outlets. It will have company in upscale chain Saks Fifth Avenue, which was bought by Canada’s oldest retailer, Hudson’s Bay Co, this summer for $2.9 billion. Up to seven full-line Canadian Saks stores and two dozen Off 5th outlets are planned. Target still expects its Canadian operations to bring in 10 percent of its profits by 2017. What it didn’t expect was the rocky start. Experts say it wanted too much, too quickly, from Canada, while underestimating domestic competition. “If they (Target) had set the bar lower, then we would not be having this conversation,” said Wells Fargo analyst Matt Nemer.

296,TGT,U.S. top court agrees to weigh bank fraud case,"WASHINGTON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to decide what federal prosecutors need to prove in order for someone to be convicted of bank fraud under federal law. The court agreed to hear the case of Kevin Loughrin, who was convicted in Salt Lake City, Utah, of six counts of bank fraud for stealing checks that he then altered so he could purchase merchandise at Target Corp stores. Loughrin’s lawyers say federal prosecutors should have to prove that their client intended to defraud the banks under which the checks were issued. Federal appeals courts are split on the intent-to-defraud question. Loughrin told police that his aim was to purchase products using the checks and then return the items for cash refunds. He was charged with using altered checks totaling $1,184. At trial, he argued that although Target suffered a loss, the banks under which the checks were issued did not because Target never submitted them for payment. Loughrin was sentenced to three years in prison. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his conviction in a March 13 ruling. Loughrin is not appealing his related convictions for identity theft and possession of stolen mail. Loughrin carried out the scheme with an accomplice, Theresa Thongsarn, who is not part of the appeal. She pleaded guilty, according to one of Loughrin’s lawyers. A Supreme Court decision is expected by the end of June. The case is Loughrin v.

300,TGT,Target cyber breach hits 40 million payment cards at holiday peak,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Target Corp said hackers have stolen data from up to 40 million credit and debit cards of shoppers who visited its stores during the first three weeks of the holiday season in the second-largest such breach reported by a U.S. retailer. The hackers worked at unprecedented speed, carrying out their operation from the day before Thanksgiving to this past Sunday, 19 days that are the heart of the crucial Christmas holiday sales season. Target, the third-largest U.S. retailer, said on Thursday that it was working with federal law enforcement and outside experts to prevent similar attacks in the future. It did not disclose how its systems were compromised. Target did not detect the attack on its own, according to a person familiar with the investigation. The retailer was alerted its systems might have been compromised by credit card processors who had noticed a surge in fraudulent transactions involving credit cards that had been used at Target, according to the source, who was not authorized to discuss the matter. The timing of the breach could not have been worse for Target, coming just before three of the four busiest days of what has been a bruising holiday season for retailers, with the highest level of discounting in years. Target itself last month lowered its profit forecast for the year after disappointing sales in the third quarter. Complaints from customers began to surface on social media as they learned of it early Thursday morning. “Most of these attacks are just a cost of doing business,” said Mark Rasch, a former U.S. prosecutor of cyber crimes. “But an attack that’s targeted against a major retailer during the peak of the Christmas season is much more than that because it undermines confidence.” Investigators are still trying to understand how the attack was carried out, including whether hackers found a weakness at Target’s own computer network or through credit card services vendors. It was not immediately clear what percent of the transactions at its brick and mortar stores had been compromised but the company said its online business had not been affected. Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley, who headed a multi-state probe into a 2007 data breach at TJX Cos, said in a statement that her office was talking to Target about the breach and how the company is addressing it, and plans to work with other Attorneys General to determine whether the company had proper safeguards in place. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a public statement that he had asked Target for more information as well. Lawyers said that there will almost definitely be class action suits against Target. The affected payment cards include Target’s REDcard private label debit and credit cards as well as other bank cards, Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder told Reuters on Thursday. She declined to say if the incident was affecting store traffic. The largest breach against a U.S. retailer, uncovered in 2007 at TJX Cos Inc, led to the theft of data from more than 90 million credit cards over about 18 months. Since then, companies have gotten far more adept at identifying intruders. But criminals have responded by developing more-powerful attack strategies, spending months on reconnaissance to launch highly sophisticated schemes with the goal of extracting as much data as they can in the shortest period of time. Representatives for J.C. Penney Co Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Best Buy Co Inc and Home Depot Inc told Reuters they believed their systems had not been compromised in similar attacks. Target will provide more details on costs related to the issue at a later date, Snyder said. She declined comment when asked if Target expected potential fines from MasterCard, Visa and American Express or saw a possible increase in merchant fees. “It’s so early in this investigation,” Snyder said. Avivah Litan, a Gartner analyst who specializes in cyber-security and fraud detection, saw costs for Target. “They are going to pay for any fraud on the card,” she said. “They will get fined (by card issuers) for non-compliance with payment card security standards. Their merchant fee will probably go up a few basis points.” Target’s shares closed down 2.2 percent at $62.15 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday afternoon, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index fell 0.06 percent. Target warned customers in an alert on its website that the criminals had stolen names, payment card numbers, expiration dates and security codes. The company had identified the breach on Sunday and had begun responding to it the same day, Snyder said. She declined to explain why the retailer waited until Thursday to alert customers about the breach. Krebs on Security, a closely watched security industry blog that broke the news on Wednesday, said the breach involved nearly all of Target’s 1,797 stores in the United States. The U.S. Secret Service is working on the investigation, according to an agency spokeswoman. A Federal Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman declined to comment. Unhappy customers began to weigh in early on Thursday, posting complaints on Target’s Facebook page. “Thank you Target for nearly costing me and my wife our identities, we will never shop or purchase anything in your store again,” said one posting. “Shop at Target, become a target,” remarked another. “Gee, thanks.” Target’s Snyder said it has been getting an “extremely high” volume of calls from customers and is adding employees to its call centers to answer questions on security breach. Krista Brewer, 27, a student at Bridgewater State University at Braintree, Massachusetts, sent Target an email and canceled her credit card on Thursday because she had used it multiple times in recent weeks at the store. “If they don’t do anything for the customers who had their cards put at risk, such as coupons or a special deal, I think I will avoid shopping there in the future,” she said. “I’m very security conscious, and they aren’t saying exactly how the breech happened.” JPMorgan Chase & Co, one of the biggest U.S. credit card issuers, said it was monitoring the accounts involved for suspicious activity and urged customers to contact the bank if they noticed any. An American Express spokeswoman said the company was aware of the incident and was putting fraud controls in place. Major card brands typically offer their cardholders zero liability and cardholders should contact their issuer if they spot suspicious transactions, a Visa spokesman said, adding that a breached account does not necessarily result in a fraudulent purchase. “This could hurt the end of the holiday season if for no other reason than many of their customers have to cancel cards ahead of holidays,” said Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser. The breach also comes at a time Target is trying to build its online business, which by some estimates is only 2 percent of sales. “All consumers will hear is that Target is not a safe place to use your credit card. That impacts trust, which in turn can impact retail’s fastest-growing and most trust-sensitive touch points: online and mobile,” said Carol Spieckerman, president of retail strategy firm newmarketbuilders. Still, consumers tend to have short memories with these things, so even if it is bad now, it will likely be less of an issue next quarter, said Gartner analyst Litan. “(Consumers) care more about discounts than security,” she said.

302,TGT,Target customers seeing red over store purchase data breach,"Dec 19 (Reuters) - Target customers were seeing red over the company’s buying data breach, venting anger online and in person on Thursday, with one suggesting a new company slogan: “Expect More. Except Security.” News that computer hackers may have stolen data from some 40 million Target-issued credit and debit cards used in stores from November 27 until December 15 shook up customers shopping the store aisles. At a Target store in Mission, Kansas, shopper John Hallock said he was reluctant to use credit cards because of security concerns. “I am wary all the time,” he said. “This makes it worse.” “If I go to Target, it will be cash only. If they knew about it and didn’t say anything, I think they did the customers a disservice, I really do,” he said. Another shopper, Roger Cook of Kansas City, Missouri, said he was “not angry, but disappointed” over the security breaches. “But if they don’t work on correcting the flaw in whatever security was breached, then I’m more likely to get angry,” he said. Target, the third-largest U.S. retailer, said it was working with federal law enforcement and outside experts to prevent similar attacks in the future. It did not disclose how its systems were compromised. Rage boiled on the Internet, where @WhatsTheT tweeted “Wow @Target has been a COMPLETE FAILURE this week. No Beyonce and now a 40 million customer hack of customer’s credit & Debit card info.” The tweet referred to the store’s announcement that it would not sell the singer’s new album because it had been released online before it was available in stores. Another shopper said the hacking episode at the height of the holiday shopping season convinced her to take her business elsewhere. “Maaaaan I had so much shopping to do @Target I guess I’ll just go to @Walmart” tweeted @Caramelbelle. Twitter user @SynAck posted the iconic Target red-and-white bullseye, which is typically accompanied by the slogan, “Expect More. Pay Less.” Instead, it read, “Expect More. Except Security.” Snarky comments, some filed on Twitter with the hashtag #HOHOHOMG, also flew on the social media site Reddit. “I called the police to report the crime. The officer asked for my name. I told him I didn’t have it since my identity had been stolen,” wrote Reddit user frowawayduh.

303,TGT,How to handle Target's data breach,"(Reuters) - If you think yours was one of the 40 million credit or debit cards involved in a data breach at Target, security experts recommend a policy of watching and waiting: Watch the account you used at the retailer on a daily basis, and wait, because there’s no telling when it will be tapped by thieves. With the information that was obtained in the data breach between November 27 and December 15 - cardholder names, card numbers and the three-digit security codes - crooks can use them for online transactions or manufacture duplicate cards. “This could be something that hits your card months from now, so you need to continue to be vigilant,” says Yaron Samid, chief executive officer of BillGuard, a company that offers a free service monitoring credit and debit cards for unusual activity. Don’t look for crazy, big-ticket charges, Samid says. Sophisticated hackers are more likely to make small purchases, sometimes aimed at checking the viability of an account. “These folks are not going to put a $10,000 charge on one card,” Samid says. “They’re going to put a $1 charge on 10,000 cards.” Small charges are less likely to be noticed and disputed, he says, and a single charge - even if it’s for just 99 cents - enables the crooks to resell the stolen information at a premium, according to Samid. A validated stolen card number is worth more than an untested one, he says. If you used a credit card at Target, you have more protection than if you used a debit card. That’s because consumers are protected from the fraudulent use of a credit card. You still have to report the fraud to your card issuer. A fraudulent charge is typically credited back to the consumer’s account after a fraud report is made. The card issuer then investigates the complaint and, unless the charge is found to be valid, the credit will be made permanent. With a debit card transaction, money immediately comes from the consumer’s bank account. After filing a fraud report with the bank, it is then in the bank’s hands when - or if - to return that money. Either way, if a fraudulent charge is spotted, consumers should get a new card. But experts say it’s better to err on the side of caution, and - at least for debit card holders - get a new card now. “I do see this as a very severe breach. Take it very seriously,” says Mark McCurley, senior information security adviser for Scottsdale, Arizona-based IDT911 Consulting, a company that does data breach prevention and post-breach analysis. McCurley says he used his debit card at a Target store during the period the numbers were stolen. He requested a new debit card and PIN number. “That’s how seriously I’m taking the matter,” he says. At a minimum, change your PIN number, experts advise. If the thieves have captured your PIN, you can prevent them from getting a cash-back during a transaction or using your card at an ATM machine, McCurley says. Molly Snyder, a spokeswoman for Target, says there is no indication at this point that PINs were collected by the thieves. Target is getting out the word to potential victims through the media and on its website, Snyder says. Consumers who have the store’s credit card or have an email address on file have been or will be notified directly, Snyder says. Customers with questions about the breach are asked to call 866-852-8680. At this point, credit monitoring is not being offered to potential victims. Additional information will be posted to Target.com, Snyder says. A notice to the retailer’s customers is posted on the company’s site, with information about putting a security freeze on credit reports, and other post-breach basics. “If you shopped in a U.S. store during that time period, we encourage you to watch your accounts.” Target has addressed the problem, she says, and assures consumers that future transactions will be protected. Robert Siciliano, online security expert for Internet security company McAfee Inc., says consumers shouldn’t have to get identity theft monitoring or freeze their credit in this case. “It didn’t affect the users’ Social Security number,” Siciliano says. “This is plain and simple a credit card breach. Bad guys use (Social Security numbers) to open up a new credit card. In this case, they don’t have to. They already have the best data they can to turn into cash.” Beyond checking on account activity and obtaining new credit cards, consumers should be on the lookout for scammers trying to take advantage of the data breach. “Be wary of any communications from people claiming to be your bank,” warns Lee Weiner, senior vice president of products and engineering for the Boston-based software security firm Rapid7. “Incidents like this provide a great opportunity for other criminals to launch ‘piggyback’ attacks,” Weiner adds. Scammers can contact you through a call or email claiming to be your card issuer, and then get you to give them your banking information, online security credentials, or visit a malicious website. If you are contacted by what appears to be your bank or other financial service company, do not clink on links, and certainly do not provide the information requested by phone or email. Contact your bank, for instance, using the number on the back of your card, Weiner says, or by going directly to the bank’s website. Piggyback crimes are claiming more victims. Just last week, Javelin Strategy & Research released a report that found the number of people notified after a data breach that they were victimized by fraud rose by 340 percent between 2010 and 2012.

306,TGT,Target probe eyes overseas hackers; stolen cards for sale online,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Investigators believe that overseas hackers were responsible for the cyber attack on U.S. retailer Target Corp that compromised up to 40 million payment cards during the first three weeks of the holiday shopping season, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday. The person, who was not authorized to talk publicly about the matter, declined to say how the hackers got in or where investigators believe they are based, saying investigators don’t want to show their hand to the criminals. Meanwhile the blogger who first broke news of the breach, Brian Krebs, reported that data stolen from Target had begun flooding underground markets that sell stolen credit cards. KrebsOnSecurity.com reported on Friday that cards stolen from Target were being offered at “card shops” for rates starting at $20 each and going to more than $100. Target has said that hackers accessed data on up to 40 million payment cards over 19 days through Dec 15 in the second-largest retail breach in U.S. history. It is not known who is behind the attack or how they accessed Target’s network. A Secret Service spokesman declined to comment on the investigation, which the agency is running. The retailer reported the breach on Thursday, a day after Krebs broke news of the attack. Target has declined to say how its systems were compromised and has provided few other details about the case. Target sought to reassure customers that it was safe to shop at its stores and encouraged them to do so by offering 10 percent discounts off most merchandise on Saturday and Sunday, the last weekend before Christmas. “We’re in this together, and in that spirit, we are extending a 10 percent discount - the same amount our team members receive,” Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel in a statement on Target’s website. Groceries are eligible for the discount, though video games, gift cards, mobile phones and a few other items are excluded. Steinhafel said the company would offer free credit monitoring services and downplayed the impact the breach might have on customers. “We want our guests to understand that just because they shopped at Target during the impacted time frame, it doesn’t mean they are victims of fraud,” he said. “In fact, in other similar situations, there are typically low levels of actual fraud.” He promised that the guests would “not be held financially responsible for any credit or debit card fraud.” Separately, Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said in a written statement that “we are hearing very few reports of actual fraud.” She said stolen information was limited to data stored on the magnetic strip. The hackers did not obtain PIN numbers used to access ATMs or the three or four-digit security codes that are printed on cards to verify online purchases, Snyder said. She also said Target has provided exposed card numbers to Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express. Those companies are in turn providing the information to the financial institutions that issue them.

309,TGT,UPDATE 6-Target cyber breach hits 40 mln payment cards at holiday peak,"By Jim Finkle and Dhanya Skariachan BOSTON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Target Corp said hackers have stolen data from up to 40 million credit and debit cards of shoppers who visited its stores during the first three weeks of the holiday season in the second-largest such breach reported by a U.S. retailer. The hackers worked at unprecedented speed, carrying out their operation from the day before Thanksgiving to this past Sunday, 19 days that are the heart of the crucial Christmas holiday sales season. Target, the third-largest U.S. retailer, said on Thursday that it was working with federal law enforcement and outside experts to prevent similar attacks in the future. It did not disclose how its systems were compromised. The retailer was alerted its systems might have been compromised by credit card processors who had noticed a surge in fraudulent transactions involving credit cards that had been used at Target, according to a person familiar with the investigation who was not authorized to discuss the matter. The timing of the breach could not have been worse for Target, coming just before three of the four busiest days of what has been a bruising holiday season for retailers, with the highest level of discounting in years. Target last month lowered its profit forecast for the year. “Most of these attacks are just a cost of doing business,” said Mark Rasch, a former U.S. prosecutor of cyber crimes. “But an attack that’s targeted against a major retailer during the peak of the Christmas season is much more than that because it undermines confidence.” Investigators are still trying to understand how the attack was carried out, including whether hackers found a weakness at Target’s computer network or through credit card services vendors. It was not immediately clear what percent of the transactions at its brick and mortar stores had been compromised but the company said its online business had not been affected. Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley, who headed a multi-state probe into a 2007 data breach at TJX Cos, said in a statement that her office was talking to Target about the breach and planned to work with other Attorneys General to determine whether the company had proper safeguards in place. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a public statement that he had asked Target for more information. A customer in California filed a class-action lawsuit against the company late on Thursday, the first of what lawyers said could be many such suits. Samantha Wredberg said in a court filing that she was a regular shopper at Target and had used her credit card at a company store on Dec. 8. Besides seeking damages, Wredberg asked the court to certify the lawsuit as class action. She also asked the court to explore whether “Target unreasonably delayed in notifying affected customers  of the data breach”. The theft of credit and debit card data from Target customers could end up costing hundreds of millions of dollars, but it is unclear who will bear the expense, lawyers and industry sources said. The affected payment cards include Target’s REDcard private label debit and credit cards as well as other bank cards, Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said. She declined to say if the incident was affecting store traffic. The largest breach against a U.S. retailer, uncovered in 2007 at TJX Cos Inc, led to the theft of data from more than 90 million credit cards over about 18 months. Since then, companies have become far more adept at identifying intruders. But criminals have responded by developing more-powerful attack strategies, spending months on reconnaissance to launch sophisticated schemes with the goal of extracting as much data as they can in the shortest period of time. Representatives for J.C. Penney Co Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Best Buy Co Inc and Home Depot Inc  told Reuters they believed their systems had not been compromised in similar attacks. Target will provide more details on costs related to the issue at a later date, Snyder said. She declined to comment when asked if Target expected potential fines from MasterCard, Visa and American Express or saw a possible increase in merchant fees. “It’s so early in this investigation,” Snyder said. Avivah Litan, a Gartner analyst who specializes in cyber-security and fraud detection, saw costs for Target. “They are going to pay for any fraud on the card,” she said. “They will get fined (by card issuers) for non-compliance with payment card security standards. Their merchant fee will probably go up a few basis points.” Target’s shares closed down 2.2 percent at $62.15 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday afternoon, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index fell 0.06 percent. Target warned customers in an alert on its website that the criminals had stolen names, payment card numbers, expiration dates and security codes. The company had identified the breach on Sunday and had begun responding to it the same day, Snyder said. She declined to explain why the retailer waited until Thursday to alert customers. Krebs on Security, a security industry blog that broke the news on Wednesday, said the breach involved nearly all of Target’s 1,797 stores in the United States. The U.S. Secret Service is working on the investigation, according to an agency spokeswoman. A Federal Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman declined to comment. Customers began to complain early on Thursday via Target’s Facebook page. “Thank you Target for nearly costing me and my wife our identities, we will never shop or purchase anything in your store again,” said one posting. “Shop at Target, become a target,” remarked another. “Gee, thanks.” Target’s Snyder said it had been getting an “extremely high” volume of calls from customers. JPMorgan Chase & Co, one of the biggest U.S. credit card issuers, said it was monitoring the accounts involved for suspicious activity and urged customers to contact the bank if they noticed any. An American Express spokeswoman said the company was aware of the incident and was putting fraud controls in place. Major card brands typically offer their cardholders zero liability and cardholders should contact their issuer if they spot suspicious transactions, a Visa spokesman said, adding that a breached account did not necessarily result in a fraudulent purchase. “This could hurt the end of the holiday season if for no other reason than many of their customers have to cancel cards ahead of holidays,” said Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser. The breach also comes at a time Target is trying to build its online business, which by some estimates is only 2 percent of sales. “All consumers will hear is that Target is not a safe place to use your credit card. That impacts trust, which in turn can impact retail’s fastest-growing and most trust-sensitive touch points: online and mobile,” said Carol Spieckerman, president of retail strategy firm newmarketbuilders. Still, consumers tend to have short memories with these things, so it will likely be less of an issue next quarter, said Gartner analyst Litan. “(Consumers) care more about discounts than security,” she said.

310,TGT,"Target breach could cost hundreds of millions, probe starts","(Reuters) - The theft of credit and debit card data from 40 million Target Corp customers could end up costing hundreds of millions of dollars, but it is unclear who will bear the expense, lawyers and industry sources said. Target said on Thursday hackers had stolen the data of shoppers who visited its stores during the first three weeks of the holiday season. Americas’s third-largest retailer said it was working with federal law enforcement and outside experts to prevent similar attacks in the future. It did not disclose how its systems were compromised. For big data breaches, the total cost typically amounts to about $17 per account, said Larry Ponemon, whose Ponemon Institute researches data breaches. The fee includes litigation, notifying customers, replacing cards, sorting bad charges from legitimate charges, and making good on bad charges, he added. For the Target breach, that would bring the total cost of the incident to somewhere around $680 million. The figure is an estimate, and a number of other factors could increase or decrease the value. For example, because these data breaches took place during the holiday season, when consumers are often spending more, banks might be slower to discover fraudulent charges, which could result in the cost being higher. It is unclear who will have to bear the cost because investigations have not yet determined who was at fault. If the breach happened at the retailer’s systems, it will likely be on the hook for the amount, lawyers said. Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder declined to comment on whether it might bear costs of the breach, or the $680 million estimate. The expenses could instead fall on the bank or banks processing the retailer’s transactions, or on third parties that the bank or banks subcontracted to, said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, a credit and debit card industry newsletter. It was not immediately clear which bank or banks held these roles. Once it is clear who to blame for the breach, Target, the card-issuing banks and the card networks, including Visa and MasterCard, will hash out all of the costs that the responsible parties will bear, said an executive at one bank. One of the biggest expenses to the company responsible will probably be reimbursing card holders. The average fraud is usually around $100 to $200 before it is caught, said Avivah Litan, an analyst at Gartner Research focusing on cyber security and fraud. But not all accounts that are compromised end up with fraudulent charges, she added. There may also be fines from regulators who claim the responsible parties violated consumer protection laws. TJX Cos, parent company of discount retailers including T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, announced in January 2007 that it had suffered from a data breach. In 2009, the company settled with 41 state attorneys general for $9.75 million. TJX’s total expenses from the breach ran into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley, who headed a multi-state probe into the breach at TJX, said in a statement that her office was talking to Target about the breach and how the company was addressing it. Her office also planned to work with other Attorneys General to determine whether the company had proper safeguards in place. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a public statement that he had asked Target for more information as well. Whoever is responsible will also likely face class action lawsuits, but plaintiffs may struggle to win much, lawyers said. Gerry Silver, a lawyer in New York who defends companies against data breaches, said he would expect class actions to be filed but that it was a tough road to win for customers. “The biggest hurdle is whether there are actual damages,” he said. “Just because a consumer’s credit card is exposed doesn’t mean there’s damages. If they didn’t suffer monetary harm, chances are there’s no viable claim.” Jason Weinstein, a partner at Steptoe & Johnson and a former federal prosecutor, said that plaintiffs often have trouble proving they have standing to sue in a case like this. Consumers may temporarily lose trust in the store’s ability to protect their credit and debit card information, retail strategist Carol Spieckerman said.

312,TGT,Millions of Target shoppers face new debit card limits,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - At least 2 million shoppers who used bank debit cards at Target Corp (TGT.N) stores during its recent data breach are facing lower limits on how much cash they can take out of teller machines and spend at stores. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said on Saturday it is notifying customers who used Chase brand debit cards at Target from November 27 through December 15 that they are now limited to $100 a day of cash withdrawals and $300 a day of purchases with their cards. The new limit effects roughly 2 million accounts, or 10 percent of Chase debit cards, according to a spokeswoman for Chase, the consumer banking business of JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets. Chase said it acted as a precaution to prevent criminals from taking money from customer accounts. Chase and other banks say they will cover unauthorized transactions that customers report. “Banks are putting various precautions in place,” Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said by email, declining to be specific about what the banks are doing. Representatives for other major banks, including Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N), told Reuters on Saturday that their institutions take steps to protect accounts, but none described specific actions so broadly limiting to cardholders as those of Chase. Target’s Snyder said that for the debit card it issues and calls Redcard, the company has activated a “deeper fraud monitoring protocol.” She did not describe the new steps. Chase said in its notice to customers that it realized its move “could not have happened at a more inconvenient time with the holiday season upon us.” At Chase, the usual debit card daily limits are $200 to $500 for cash withdrawals and $500 for purchases, according to a bank spokeswoman. “It seems like the banks are the ‘Grinch who stole Christmas,’” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, a consumer advocacy group based in Los Angeles. “It is Target’s fault, but children across America are going to bear the price ... The banks are protecting themselves.” Chase spelled out the new limits in an email to customers with the subject line: “Unfortunately, your debit card is at risk by the breach at Target stores.” Target said on Thursday that computer hackers had stolen data from as many as 40 million credit and debit cards of shoppers who visited its stores during the first three weeks of the holiday season. Chase said in the letter that it plans to reissue affected debit cards over the coming weeks and in the meantime said employees at its 5,600 branches would help those who need more cash. Many branches will stay open late if needed, the letter said. Debit cards, unlike credit cards, typically require customers to enter personal identification numbers when they make purchases at store check-out counters. Initial reports of Target’s security breach said data may have been taken through devices at its counters. Debit cards are used to spend money that has been deposited in checking and other demand accounts at banks.

318,TGT,Target payment card data theft highlights lagging U.S. security,"BOSTON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The massive data breach disclosed by retailer Target Corp last week is likely to teach its U.S. customers a painful lesson in payment card security and build support for an anti-fraud technology now sitting on the shelf. For years, U.S. merchants and banks have balked at adopting a well-established system that uses credit and debit cards that store information on computer chips. The technology, ubiquitous in Europe, Canada and elsewhere, makes it harder for thieves to misuse data compared with cards that store data only on magnetic stripes. The problem is the costs of the new chips and some 10 million payment terminals to process them. The delay may prove costly to Target’s U.S. customers. The third-largest U.S. retailer said unknown hackers stole data from up to 40 million credit and debit cards used at its stores in the first three weeks of the holiday season. Now, after years in which U.S. companies tolerated fraud as a cost of doing business, high-profile breaches such as the one at Target are raising demand for increased card security. “There’s no doubt in my mind it will happen over the next two years. The fraud risk is too high,” said Rush Taggart, chief security officer of CardConnect of King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, which helps merchants process payments. “I think we all wish it had happened over the last four years.” An early switch to the global card system may not have prevented the Target data theft but the chip technology would have reduced the value of the stolen data by making it harder for hackers to reuse the customer information. For one thing, the new systems are better at detecting counterfeit cards. Visa Inc has warned that merchants’ banks may start bearing the costs of fraud starting in October 2015 if the merchants don’t upgrade. In much of Europe, 94 percent of sales terminals use the chip system, according to a 2012 report by consulting firm Javelin Strategy & Research. The figure was 77 percent in Canada and Latin America. That compares with only 10 percent of U.S. sales terminals with upgrades. The report said the figure would still reach only 60 percent by Visa’s October 2015 deadline. And the timetable could face delays if merchants push back on changes that banks and processors want but will not pay for. Retailers over the summer won a ruling from a U.S. district court judge in Washington that could help them reduce the fees that banks can charge for debit card transactions. Banks had counted on those fees to pay for extra network upgrades, and the uncertainty could put off further investment, said Al Pascual, a senior analyst at Javelin. “We should move to it,” Pascual said about the new standard. “But ‘should’ and ‘would’ are two different things,” he said. Some U.S. banks, including Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co, have begun to issue chip-carrying cards that meet the global standard - known as EMV, the initials of the companies that created it in 1994: Europay International SA, MasterCard and Visa. (MasterCard bought Europay in 2002.) There are now nearly 1.6 billion EMV payment cards in use worldwide. Wells Fargo said recently its U.S. customers with the Visa consumer credit cards it issues may request a new card with a chip to use while traveling. “Today, very few domestic merchant terminals support EMV technology, so there is little need for a full-scale roll-out,” a Wells Fargo spokesman said via e-mail. U.S. banks and merchants have tolerated the weak security in part because they are able absorb the costs, said David Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, a California trade journal that tracks the payments industry. In its August issue, Nilson said global card fraud rose to a record $11.3 billion in 2012, from just under $10 billion the year before. Nearly half the losses occurred in the United States, helped by the lack of the more advanced card readers. But on a volume basis the losses amounted to just 5.2 cents for every $100 that consumers put on payment cards, up from 5.07 cents per $100 in 2011. Those figures are insignificant for most of the players in the chain, Robertson said. “It’s a very manageable cost,” Robertson said. Organized shoplifting in comparison costs U.S. merchants around $30 billion per year, he said. Consumers, who are generally not held responsible for covering for fraudulent purchases, have had little incentive to push for change. But the rising fraud rates also mean more dangers of identity theft. Target said it was still reviewing how the attack was carried out, but experts expect that systems at cash registers were compromised. A Target spokeswoman did not respond to questions for this article. The incident appeared to be among the largest security breaches in retail history, though it fell short of the one announced by retailer TJX Cos in 2007, which was blamed on poor security in the wireless computer networks at TJX stores. Since then, retailers have upgraded their systems under what are meant to be the secure Payment Card Industry standards, or PCI, meant to cover existing magnetic stripe cards. But Gartner Research analyst Avivah Litan said many breaches since then have occurred at companies that officially met the standards. The problem is the magnetic stripe used to store data on most U.S. cards is not secure enough to begin with, said Litan, who favors upgrades to EMV. “PCI isn’t working because it is attempting to patch an inherently insecure payment card system and network,” she said. “We can’t expect retailers to patch their systems to work around the weaknesses of this antiquated technology,” she said. Nilson’s Robertson said the rise of mobile phones as payment devices may complicate upgrade plans because they could crowd out payment cards. If that happens soon, companies may have wasted billions of dollars. “It would be like investing in improving silent movies when everyone else is moving to sound,” Robertson said.",12222013,http://www.reuters.com/article/target-security-lagging/target-payment-card-data-theft-highlights-lagging-u-s-security-idUSL2N0K004A20131222

320,TGT,Target meets with state attorneys as lawsuits pile up,"BOSTON/NEW YORK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Target Corp’s  general counsel, Timothy Baer, spoke with top state prosecutors on Monday to address their concerns about a massive data breach, as consumer lawsuits piled up against the retailer and two U.S. senators called for a federal probe. Attorneys general from several states including Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York have asked the company to provide more information about the cyber attack, in which hackers stole data from as many as 40 million credit and debit cards of shoppers who visited Target stores during the first three weeks of the holiday shopping season. Target did not specify which state officials Baer spoke with to “bring them up to date” on the data breach, the second-largest in U.S. retail history. The No. 3 U.S. retailer said the call took place earlier on Monday but gave few details on the discussion. The company faces at least 15 lawsuits seeking class action status as a result of the cyber attack. The suits were filed by people who claim their information was stolen and they allege that Target either failed to properly secure the customer data, did not promptly notify customers of the breach or both. Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said it was company policy not to comment on litigation. The Secret Service is leading the government’s investigation into the matter. Target has not said how its systems were compromised, except to say the operation was “sophisticated.” It has apologized and offered 10 percent discounts over the weekend to bring disgruntled customers back to stores. With so little information disclosed so far about the attack, it is unclear whether the plaintiffs will be able to prove their allegations. Meanwhile, two Democratic U.S. Senators, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Chuck Schumer of New York, have asked the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to investigate the breach. “If Target failed to adequately protect customer information, it denied customers the protection that they rightly expect when a business collects their personal information,” Blumenthal said in a letter to FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez on Monday. “Its conduct would be unfair and deceptive.” An FTC spokeswoman confirmed that the letters had been received but said she could not comment on whether a probe was in the works, citing a policy not to discuss ongoing investigations. Shares of Target shares have fallen about 2.8 percent since the company disclosed the breach early on Thursday, erasing about $1 billion in market value. The S&P; 500 Index has been little changed over the same period. Target’s consumer perception scores have dropped to their lowest level since 2007, according to a survey of 15,000 people by YouGov BrandIndex, which tracks public perception of thousands of brands around the world. Target’s Buzz score for the week preceding the data breach announcement was 26. The Buzz score was -19 on Monday, representing a drop of 45 points. (YouGov BrandIndex’s Buzz score ranges from 100 to -100 and is compiled by subtracting negative feedback from positive. The survey has an error of plus or minus 2 percent.) “Right now, some consumers are not sure if they can trust Target with their personal information,” said Ted Marzilli, chief executive of YouGov BrandIndex. Prior to the breach, Target’s consumer perception score was more than twice the average of the retail group that includes chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Gap Inc, Best Buy Co Inc and Amazon.com Inc. Target’s scores have also dropped about 10 to 15 points in the last week or so on purchase consideration. “There are fewer consumers citing Target as a brand that they would consider purchasing from. That is a bad sign for Target,” said Marzilli. Citibank took four weeks and Sony took eight weeks to recover from the hit to consumer perception after incidents of data breaches. Marzilli said he expects Target to take 12 weeks or longer to recover, unless more problems emerge.",12232013,http://www.reuters.com/article/target-breach-legal/target-meets-with-state-attorneys-as-lawsuits-pile-up-idUSL2N0K20W420131223

324,TGT,Exclusive: Target hackers stole encrypted bank PINs - source,"BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The hackers who attacked Target Corp (TGT.N) and compromised up to 40 million credit cards and debit cards also managed to steal encrypted personal identification numbers (PINs), according to a senior payments executive familiar with the situation. One major U.S. bank fears that the thieves would be able to crack the encryption code and make fraudulent withdrawals from consumer bank accounts, said the executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the data breach is still under investigation. Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said “no unencrypted PIN data was accessed” and there was no evidence that PIN data has been “compromised.” She confirmed that some “encrypted data” was stolen, but declined to say if that included encrypted PINs. “We continue to have no reason to believe that PIN data, whether encrypted or unencrypted, was compromised. And we have not been made aware of any such issue in communications with financial institutions to date,” Snyder said by email. “We are very early in an ongoing forensic and criminal investigation.” The No. 3 U.S. retailer said last week that hackers stole data from as many as 40 million cards used at Target stores during the first three weeks of the holiday shopping season, making it the second-largest data breach in U.S. retail history. Target has not said how its systems were compromised, though it described the operation as “sophisticated.” The U.S. Secret Service and the Justice Department are investigating. Officials with both agencies have declined comment on the investigations. The attack could end up costing hundreds of millions of dollars, but it is unclear so far who will bear the expense. While bank customers are typically not liable for losses because of fraudulent activity on their credit and debit cards, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Santander Bank (SAN.MC) said they have lowered limits on how much cash customers can take out of teller machines and spend at stores. The unprecedented move has led to complaints from consumer advocates about the inconvenience it caused from the late November Thanksgiving holiday into the run-up to Christmas. But sorting out account activity after a fraudulent withdrawal could take a lot more time and be worse for customers. JPMorgan has said it was able to reduce inconvenience by giving customers new debit cards printed quickly at many of its branches, and by keeping branches open for extended hours. A Santander spokeswoman was not available for comment on Tuesday. Security experts said it is highly unusual for banks to reduce caps on withdrawals, and the move likely reflects worries that PINs have fallen into criminal hands, even if they are encrypted. “That’s a really extreme measure to take,” said Avivah Litan, a Gartner analyst who specializes in cyber security and fraud detection. “They definitely found something in the data that showed there was something happening with cash withdrawals.” While the use of encryption codes may prevent amateur hackers from obtaining the digital keys to customer bank deposits, the concern is the coding cannot stop the kind of sophisticated cyber criminal who was able to infiltrate Target for three weeks. Daniel Clemens, CEO of Packet Ninjas, a cyber security consulting firm, said banks were prudent to lower debit card limits because they will not know for sure if Target’s PIN encryption was infallible until the investigation is completed. As an example of potential vulnerabilities in PIN encryption, Clemens said he once worked for a retailer who hired his firm to hack into its network to find security vulnerabilities. He was able to access the closely guarded digital “key” used to unscramble encrypted PINs, which he said surprised his client, who thought the data was secure. In other cases, hackers can get PINs by using a tool known as a “RAM scraper,” which captures the PINs while they are temporarily stored in memory, Clemens said. The attack on Target began on November 27, the day before the Thanksgiving holiday and continued until December 15. Banks that issue debit and credit cards learned about the breach on December 18, and Target publicly disclosed the loss of personal account data on December 19. On December 21, JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, alerted 2 million of its debit cardholders that it was lowering the daily limits on ATM withdrawals to $100 and capping store purchases with their cards at $500. On Monday, the bank partly eased the limits it had imposed on Saturday, setting them at $250 a day for ATM withdrawals and $1,000 a day for purchases. (The usual debit card daily limits are $200 to $500 for cash withdrawals and $500 for purchases, a bank spokeswoman said last week.) On Monday, Santander - a unit of Spain’s Banco Santander (SAN.MC) - followed suit, lowering the daily limits on cash withdrawals and purchases on Santander and Sovereign branded debit and credit cards of customers who used them at Target when the breach occurred. Santander did not disclose the new limits, but said it was monitoring the accounts and issuing new cards to customers who were affected. The largest breach against a U.S. retailer, uncovered in 2007 at TJX Cos Inc (TJX.N), led to the theft of data from more than 90 million credit cards over about 18 months.

325,TGT,"UPDATE 1-U.S. shops use prices, pick-ups to snare holiday stragglers","By Phil Wahba WEST NYACK, NEW YORK, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Retailers are trying new ways to win over Christmas procrastinators. Brick-and-mortar chains seeking ways to improve this season’s soft sales made it easier for last-minute consumers to finish their shopping on Christmas Eve. More customers this year will be able to pick up orders placed online in stores on Tuesday, the last shopping day before Christmas. For retailers, it can mean lower shipping costs - protecting profit margins - and the potential for more last-minute business when consumers visit. “There is not a whole lot you can do at the 11th hour, but this is one of the few levers you can pull,” said Sucharita Mulpuru, an e-commerce analyst at Forrester Research, about what the industry calls “omni-channel” shopping. “If they can convince even 1 percent more customers to come to their stores, that’s a big win.” Sales at retail stores, excluding e-commerce, fell 2.1 percent this past weekend, the busiest of the season, according to data firm ShopperTrak. That came three weeks after a poor showing on Thanksgiving weekend, raising concerns the season is turning out to be a bust. By Tuesday, most retailers had slashed prices to encourage purchases. Aeropostale Inc offered an extra 50 percent off on items already marked down while Abercrombie & Fitch  touted half off everything in the store. Gap Inc  was offering up to 60 percent off select items. Stores wouldn’t say how much in-store pickup would contribute to sales, but Target Corp started its in-store pickup service in November for select items, and Macy’s Inc is testing it at about 10 Washington, D.C. area stores. Ten years ago, Sears was one of the first retailers to introduce order online and pick-up at stores. This year, customers can use an app and have deliveries brought to the curb, said Brian Hanover, a spokesman for Sears. “This is a procrastinator’s dream,” he said. Wal-Mart Stores is offering three times as many products this year as last year that can be picked up in stores using this service. “This is helpful because you get better deals online,” said Shantelle Williams, 47, who Tuesday picked up a large screen television at a Walmart in Suffern, New York, which she had ordered on Black Friday while visiting another state. “I didn’t have to come in to see if they had those items. “ Gap Inc’s “reserve-in-store” service, launched in June and expanded before the holiday season, lets shoppers go online to ask one of 600 Gap or Banana Republic stores to hold up to five items. The service was available on Christmas Eve. Shoppers now visit 3 to 3.5 stores per trip, down from 4.5 to 5 stores in 2007, according to Bill Martin, founder of data firm ShopperTrak. That makes it even more important for retailers to make the best use of their shops. Another benefit to offering in-store pickup: Shoppers like it. More than 40 percent of people wanted the relatively new, unknown service, according to a poll conducted last week of 3,308 online shoppers for Reuters by Bizrate Insights. “On line ordering is so much easier,” said Laurie Connelly, 47, who was at a Best Buy Co Tuesday in West Nyack, New York - 40 miles north of New York City - to pick up a printer she had ordered online. “You come in to pick up your orders, and no lines. It’s great especially on a busy day like today.” BIGGER SHARE OF THE HOLIDAY E-COMMERCE PIE Blending e-commerce and stores is already paying off for some. Online orders filled by a mix of both stores and e-commerce distribution centers accounted for 21 percent of e-commerce sales this holiday season compared with 17 percent in 2012, according to eBay Enterprise CEO Chris Sadirakis. EBay Enterprise clients include Aeropostale, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Toys R Us, and GNC. The use of stores to help fill online merchandise sent to shoppers’ homes is also increasing. The ability to use unsold merchandise in stores to fill an online order helps margins by moving an item that might otherwise have ended up in the clearance bin. Macy’s Inc now uses 500 of its 810 stores to help fill orders, up from 300 last year, and Kohl’s Corp began “ship-from-store” service this year at 200 of its 1,100 stores. Wal-Mart is testing it at 35 of its 4,100 U.S. stores. The next step, according to many analysts, will be for stores to provide the same-day delivery already available in some major cities by Amazon and EBay. Amazon shoppers can get same-day delivery on Christmas Eve in major cities such as Seattle and New York. EBay Enterprise’s Sadirakis told Reuters he expected same-day delivery to be a much bigger part of the 2014 holiday season as retailers fine-tune it in the next year. “You want your website to get people into your stores, and you want your stores to get people to shop on your website,” said ShopperTrak’s Bill Martin. Otherwise, retailers will continue to see traffic drop, he warned.",12242013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-retail-omnichannel/update-1-u-s-shops-use-prices-pick-ups-to-snare-holiday-stragglers-idUSL2N0K30FF20131224
326,TGT,Broker cuts Target earnings outlook after data theft,"Dec 24 (Reuters) - Brokerage Cowen and Co cut its earnings forecast on Target Corp after the massive theft of card data over the holiday season, saying the breach was likely to drive away customers and impact margins as the retailer increases discounts. Investors have so far downplayed the impact from hackers who stole data on up to 40 million credit and debit cards from Target shoppers during the first three weeks of the holiday season. Shares of the third-largest U.S. retailer have fallen just 3 percent since the data theft was revealed, on expectations the one-off impact will be small. Cowen said it was hard to quantify the effect of the breach but expects some loss of customers and an impact from increased discounting, such as the chain’s 10 percent storewide price cuts over the weekend. The brokerage cut its fourth-quarter profit forecast to $1.40 per share from $1.52, excluding Target’s operations in Canada and one-time items. That is still higher than the average analyst estimate of $1.25 per share for the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Target has not updated its earnings forecast since the breach was revealed. Retail consultancy Customer Growth Partners LLC said on Monday that Target suffered from a 5 percent reduction in customer traffic over the weekend in the wake of the breach. [ID: nL2N0K20AQ] But shoppers interviewed at Target stores said they were using cash more rather than staying away. “No place is safe. Any place you shop, you take your chances,” said Alan Rios, 43, a doctor from West Nyack, New York. The blog that first revealed the data theft, KrebsOnSecurity.com, says card details stolen from Target have flooded onto online markets that sell stolen credit cards. Target shares were down 0.7 percent at $61.45 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

327,TGT,Target meets with state attorneys as lawsuits pile up,"BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Target Corp’s general counsel, Timothy Baer, spoke with top state prosecutors on Monday to address their concerns about a massive data breach, as consumer lawsuits piled up against the retailer and two U.S. senators called for a federal probe. Attorneys general from several states including Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York have asked the company to provide more information about the cyber attack, in which hackers stole data from as many as 40 million credit and debit cards of shoppers who visited Target stores during the first three weeks of the holiday shopping season. Target did not specify which state officials Baer spoke with to “bring them up to date” on the data breach, the second-largest in U.S. retail history. The No. 3 U.S. retailer said the call took place earlier on Monday but gave few details on the discussion. The company faces at least 15 lawsuits seeking class action status as a result of the cyber attack. The suits were filed by people who claim their information was stolen and they allege that Target either failed to properly secure the customer data, did not promptly notify customers of the breach or both. Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said it was company policy not to comment on litigation. The Secret Service is leading the government’s investigation into the matter. Target has not said how its systems were compromised, except to say the operation was “sophisticated.” It has apologized and offered 10 percent discounts over the weekend to bring disgruntled customers back to stores. With so little information disclosed so far about the attack, it is unclear whether the plaintiffs will be able to prove their allegations. Meanwhile, two Democratic U.S. Senators, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Chuck Schumer of New York, have asked the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to investigate the breach. “If Target failed to adequately protect customer information, it denied customers the protection that they rightly expect when a business collects their personal information,” Blumenthal said in a letter to FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez on Monday. “Its conduct would be unfair and deceptive.” An FTC spokeswoman confirmed that the letters had been received but said she could not comment on whether a probe was in the works, citing a policy not to discuss ongoing investigations. Shares of Target shares have fallen about 2.8 percent since the company disclosed the breach early on Thursday, erasing about $1 billion in market value. The S&P; 500 Index has been little changed over the same period. Target’s consumer perception scores have dropped to their lowest level since 2007, according to a survey of 15,000 people by YouGov BrandIndex, which tracks public perception of thousands of brands around the world.

That is a bad sign for Target,” said Marzilli. Citibank took four weeks and Sony took eight weeks to recover from the hit to consumer perception after incidents of data breaches.

330,TGT,"UPDATE 4-Target says PINs stolen, but confident data secure","By Jim Finkle and Dhanya Skariachan BOSTON/NEW YORK, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Target Corp said PIN data of some customers’ bank ATM cards were stolen in a massive cyber attack at the third-largest U.S. retailer, but it was confident that the information was “safe and secure.” The stolen PIN data was “strongly encrypted” when it was removed from Target’s systems, spokeswoman Molly Snyder said in a statement on Friday. “The most important thing for our guests to know is that their debit card accounts have not been compromised due to the encrypted PIN numbers being taken,” Snyder said. News of the PIN theft was first reported by Reuters on Tuesday. Target uses the Triple DES encryption standard that can only be unlocked with a digital cryptographic “key” when the PIN data is received by the company’s outside payment processor, she noted. Target has declined to identify its payment processor. “The ‘key’ necessary to decrypt that data has never existed within Target’s system and could not have been taken during this incident,” Snyder said. Some security experts said that even if the encryption is not broken, cyber criminals can still break the PINs. “There is potential for gaining access to debit card accounts,” said Shane Shook, an executive with the cyber security firm Cylance Inc, who has investigated some of the biggest cyber breaches. While it is virtually impossible to decrypt a PIN without the digital key to unlock it, Shook said many debit card holders choose easy-to-guess numbers like 1234. He said that in some investigations he has found that more than 20 percent of PINs could easily be guessed. Chris Morales, research director with NSS Labs and a security expert who has helped investigate major breaches, said the hackers may be able to crack the PINs on some of the stolen debit cards. U.S. merchants and banks have refused to adopt technologies used overseas, such as embedding credit cards with computer chips for additional security. Instead they use PINs to secure accounts, which leave them more vulnerable to theft. “PINs are not secure,” Morales said. Criminals can identify PINs by using online systems some banks offer which allow customers to access their accounts using their debit card numbers and PINs, he said. Madeline Aufseeser, a credit card analyst with research firm Aite Group, said she does not believe the hackers could unscramble the PINs, but still advises Target customers whose accounts have been compromised to replace their cards immediately. “Smart consumers are calling their banks and getting them reissued,” she said. “Better safe than sorry.” Target has said little about how the cyber crooks accessed its network or stole the data in the attack which breached 40 million payment card numbers at unprecedented speed. The attack began on Nov. 27, the day before the Thanksgiving holiday and continued until Dec. 1, making it the second-largest data breach in U.S. retail history. The largest breach against a U.S. retailer, uncovered in 2007 at TJX Cos Inc, led to the theft of data from more than 90 million credit cards over about 18 months. News of the breach at Target has hurt the retailer’s reputation and stock price. Target’s consumer perception scores dropped to their lowest level since 2007 after the breach, according to a survey of 15,000 people by YouGov BrandIndex, which tracks thousands of brands around the world. “Target’s problems may very well continue and that is unfortunate, as we’ve been seeing a little bit of a perception rebound the last two days,” YouGov BrandIndex Chief Executive Ted Marzilli said. Marzilli said Target’s perception scores bottomed out the day before Christmas and the impact from the latest news could be less severe now that the holiday shopping rush is over. The Minneapolis-based retailer’s shares have fallen about 2.3 percent since Dec. 18, when news of the cyber attack broke, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 index has risen 1.7 percent over the same period. Target is due to report quarterly results on Feb. 26, but may disclose the impact of the breach sooner.

334,TGT,"Target breach worse than thought, states launch joint probe","NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - The data breach at Target Corp over the holiday shopping season was far bigger than initially thought, the U.S. company said on Friday, as state prosecutors announced a nationwide probe into the second-biggest retail cyber attack on record. Target said an investigation has found that the hackers stole the personal information of at least 70 million customers, including names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses. Previously, the No.3 U.S. retailer said the hackers stole data from 40 million credit and debit cards. The two sets of numbers likely contained some overlap, but the extent was not clear, according to Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder. She also noted that some of the victims did not shop at Target stores during the period of the breach between November 27 and December 15, and their personal information was stolen from a database. “I know that it is frustrating for our guests to learn that this information was taken and we are truly sorry they are having to endure this,” Target Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel said in the statement on Friday. Attorneys general from New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Minnesota said they were joining a nationwide probe into the security breach. A source familiar with the joint probe said more than 30 states were involved. “A breach of this magnitude is extremely disconcerting and we are participating in a multi-state investigation to discover the circumstances that led to this breach,” said Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley. Security experts said the stolen payment card data could be used to fabricate false magnetic strip credit cards. And the personal information could be sold on underground exchanges for use in email “phishing” campaigns, aimed at persuading victims to hand over even more sensitive information, such as bank account numbers. “I think they still have no idea how big this is,” said David Kennedy, a former U.S. Marine Corps cyber-intelligence analyst who runs his own consulting firm, TrustedSec LLC. Target lowered its fourth-quarter profit forecast, in part due to weaker-than-expected sales since reports of the cyber-attack emerged in mid-December. Target shares closed down just over 1 percent to $62.62, hovering near a year-low. The largest known breach at a U.S. retailer, uncovered in 2007 was at TJX Cos Inc, where more than 90 million credit cards were stolen over about 18 months. Reports of fraudulent card charges have been growing since the Target breach was disclosed, said an executive at one major card issuer who asked not to be identified. The full magnitude of the damage will not likely be known until later in January, when customers receive and examine their monthly statements and call their banks, the executive said. He added that, in past cases, it has taken 30 to 45 days for the vast majority of bad charges to surface. Target and credit card issuers have said customers will have zero liability for the cost of any fraudulent charges. Harlan Loeb, global chairman of the crisis & risk management practice at Edelman, said Target should have been more proactive in communicating with its customers. He thinks Target will have a tougher task containing the situation than TJX did. “The game has changed so dramatically since 2007,” Loeb said, citing “the dramatic escalation of information channels and the sophistication of hackers” since then. “The one thing that should be part of any crisis plan is the specter that you might have to be in communication with hundreds of thousands of customers instantly,” Loeb said. “There was an element of that missing” in Target’s case. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, 40 percent of people who shopped at Target during the period of the data breach had not been notified about the incident. Thirty-one percent said they had been notified by Target and 28 percent said they had been notified by their bank or credit card company. The results represent 640 surveys conducted from January 2 to January 10 with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. In the wake of the Target breach, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy introduced on Wednesday a new version of a 2005 bill that seeks to improve how companies protect consumer data from cyber thieves. It would set criminal penalties for intentional or willful concealing of a personal data breach that causes economic damage to consumers, and ensure that conspiring or attempting to commit computer fraud would face the same penalties as completed offenses. “This is a terrible situation and it’s upsetting to see that the scope of this breach is larger than first thought,” said Senator Al Franken of Minnesota, who is one of three Democrats currently signed on to Leahy’s bill as co-sponsors. “Data breaches like this one, and past breaches such as at T.J. Maxx and Sony PlayStation, raise important questions about the responsibilities corporations have to protect consumer data and inform their customers when data have been compromised.” Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, is also co-sponsoring the bill. “Disclosures about Target’s even broader breaches of customer information will rightly add alarm and anger. Now, more than ever, an FTC investigation is necessary - and should be publicly confirmed - so that consumers know their rights and interests are protected,” Blumenthal said in a statement. The Federal Trade Commission privacy spokesman declined to comment, saying the agency does not confirm or deny the existence of investigations. Data breach laws are more specific on the state level and the FTC can only bring lawsuits under the FTC Act against companies if they are deemed to not have protected the data properly. On Friday, Target cut its fourth-quarter adjusted earnings forecast for U.S. operations to between $1.20 and $1.30 per share from $1.50 to $1.60. The Minneapolis-based company also forecast a 2.5 percent decline in fourth-quarter same-store sales. It had forecast flat sales. Target expects full-year earnings per share to include charges related to the data breach, but said it could not estimate the costs. Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser described Target’s holiday sales report card as “dismal.” “We all knew it was going to be bad at Target, but it was the magnitude of decline that was unclear,” he said. “Clearly, the first half of the fourth quarter was impacted by an aggressive holiday season across retail, but the credit card data breach had a significant impact post December 19th.” “The key risk remains the time it takes for consumers to forgive Target. If this is like past breaches this should normalize as the year progresses,” Strasser added.

336,TGT,Factbox: How to deal with Target's data breach,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The number of people affected by Target’s data breach during the holiday season is now expected to be least 70 million, up from the company’s original estimate of 40 million. That means many more people need to assess their credit and debit card security. Late last year, Target reported that thieves stole cardholder names, card numbers and three-digit security codes between November 27 and December 15, and that information could be used at any point to commit fraud. Now the retailer says additional personal information was stolen, including email addresses and phone numbers. “I know that it is frustrating for our guests to learn that this information was taken, and we are truly sorry they are having to endure this,” Target’s chief executive, Gregg Steinhafel, said in a statement. If you shopped at Target during that time period — or at other times — and are worried about your accounts, here are answers from experts on the most frequent questions: Q: How did the hackers get phone numbers, street and email addresses? Is this kind of data included in store transactions? A: Target is still investigating the incident, which is why the number of people affected and the scope of the breach keeps changing. The information stored on the magnetic stripe on a credit or debit card will not pass along a home address or email address from an in-store swipe. But other cards may share additional info, like a store-brand credit card that requires the user to provide that data at sign-up. If thieves have this information, it could also mean online purchases are affected, said Robert Siciliano, online security expert for Internet security company McAfee Inc. “There is certainly more to this story,” he says. Q: How do you know if your information is stolen? A: It’s impossible to know if your data has been stolen and if it might be used for fraud, but it is a growing problem and consumers need to be on alert. The number of people notified after a data breach that they were victimized by fraud rose by 340 percent between 2010 and 2012, according to a recent report from Javelin Strategy & Research. Q: What should Target customers do? A: At a minimum, customers who shopped at Target during the affected period with a debit card should change their PIN, the personal identification number. You can also request a new debit card from the issuer. Credit card users can change passwords or ask for a new card, but that may be more trouble than it’s worth and give a false sense of security because the new card is just as vulnerable. “It is going to quite a hassle to update all of your subscriptions and services attached to that card,” said Yaron Samid, chief executive of BillGuard, a company that offers a free service monitoring credit and debit cards for unusual activity. “The only way to protect yourself is to pay close attention to your credit card activity.” Target says it is offering one year of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection to all Target customers who shopped at U.S. stores. Target customers have three months to enroll in the program. The company says it will announce additional details next week. Customers who have additional questions can call Target’s hotline at 866-852-8680. Q: What should all consumers do? A: The first line of defense for all credit and debit card holders is to closely monitor your credit and debit card statements all the time, say security experts. If charges are not disputed, a thief will know the information is valid, allowing the card to be used again illegally, said Yaron Samid, chief executive of BillGuard, a company that offers a free service monitoring credit and debit cards for unusual activity. Fraudulent charges are often small in scope, because thieves know they are less likely to be noticed. If you dispute a charge on a credit card, the issuer will typically credit that amount back to you, and then investigate. With debit cards, which have fewer protections against fraud, the bank will decide to investigate, then decide when and if to credit the amount back to your account. The most aggressive action a consumer can take is to freeze their accounts, which restricts access to your credit report. That can stop account fraud cold when crooks apply for credit using your information, though lifting a credit freeze if you want to apply for a loan or a new credit card is a bit cumbersome. It involves a password-protected process and often carries a fee. It might take up to three days. Q: How are consumers at further risk than just their debit card and PINs being stolen? A: Any personal information stolen, like email addresses and phone numbers, could be used for other identity theft “phishing” attacks, where a criminal contacts a person looking for even more information and access to accounts. In the Target data breach, piggyback attacks could come from scammers pretending to be banks or credit card issuers, asking you for even more information, particularly your Social Security number, warns Siciliano. “The goal of the bad guy is always to get a credit card under your name — to take one over or get a new one,” said Siciliano. The good news is that in order to do that, a thief needs your Social Security number, and Social Security information was not passed along in this breach, Siciliano notes. The bad news is that thieves will work during a long period of time to bait you for sensitive information, luring you in with what they already have stolen, he adds. To combat this, he recommends identity theft protection for everyone, which his company sells. “Without it, you’re a sitting duck,” Siciliano said.

The high-end department store was informed by its credit-card processor in mid-December of possible unauthorized card activity that followed customer purchases at Neiman Marcus stores, spokeswoman Ginger Reeder said. A subsequent investigation turned up evidence on Jan. 1 of a “criminal cybersecurity intrusion” that may have compromised an unknown number of customers’ cards, the company said. Neiman Marcus, owned by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and private equity firm Ares Management LLC, is still investigating and said it did not know at this time how many customers may have been affected. Nor was it immediately clear whether it was linked to the Target incident.

340,TGT,Exclusive: More well-known U.S. retailers victims of cyber attacks - sources,"BOSTON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Target Corp and Neiman Marcus are not the only U.S. retailers whose networks were breached over the holiday shopping season last year, according to sources familiar with attacks on other merchants that have yet to be publicly disclosed. Smaller breaches on at least three other well-known U.S. retailers took place and were conducted using similar techniques as the one on Target, according to the people familiar with the attacks. Those breaches have yet to come to light. Also, similar breaches may have occurred earlier last year. The sources said that they involved retailers with outlets in malls, but declined to elaborate. They also said that while they suspect the perpetrators may be the same as those who launched the Target attack, they cannot be sure because they are still trying to find the culprits behind all of the security breaches. Law enforcement sources have said they suspect the ring leaders are from Eastern Europe, which is where most big cyber crime cases have been hatched over the past decade. Only one well-known retailer, Neiman Marcus, has said that they too have been victim of a cyber attack since Target’s December 19 disclosure that some 40 million payment card numbers had been stolen in a cyber attack. On Friday, Target said the data breach was worse than initially thought. An investigation found that hackers stole the personal information of at least 70 million customers, including names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses. Neiman Marcus said it was not sure if the breach was related to the Target incident. Most states have laws that require companies to contact customers when certain personal information is compromised. In many cases the task of notification falls on the credit card issuer. Merchants are required to report breaches of personal information including social security numbers. It was not immediately clear if that was the case with the retailers who were attacked around the same time as Target. The Secret Service and Department of Justice, which are investigating the Target breach, declined to comment on Saturday. Target has not disclosed how the attackers managed to breach its network or siphon off some of its most sensitive data. The sources who spoke to Reuters about the breaches said that investigators believe the attackers used similar techniques and pieces of malicious software to steal data from Target and other retailers. One of the pieces of malware they used was something known as a RAM scraper, or memory-parsing software, which enables cyber criminals to grab encrypted data by capturing it when it travels through the live memory of a computer, where it appears in plain text, the sources said. While the technology has been around for many years, its use has increased in recent years as retailers have improved their security, making it more difficult for hackers to obtain credit card data using other approaches. Visa Inc issued two alerts last year about a surge in cyber attacks on retailers that specifically warned about the threat from memory parsing malware. The alerts, published in April and August, provided retailers with technical details on how the attacks were launched and advice on thwarting them. A Visa spokeswoman declined comment on the reports, which did not identify specific victims. It was not clear whether Target’s security team had implemented the measures that Visa had recommended to mitigate the risks of being attacked. Yet a law enforcement source familiar with the breach said that even if the retailer had implemented those steps, the efforts may not have succeeded in stopping the attack. That is because the attackers were more sophisticated than the ones in the previous attacks described in the Visa alerts, according to the source. The source asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Retailers are often reluctant to report breaches out of concern it could hurt their businesses. Target only acknowledged its 2013 attack after security blogger Brian Krebs reported the breach, prompting inquiries from journalists and investors. Neiman Marcus said an outside forensics firm discovered evidence on January 1 that indicated the retailer had been the victim of a cyber attack. It disclosed the breach nine days later, after another inquiry from Krebs, who was following up on reports about a surge in fraudulent charges traced to the retailer. Target and J.C. Penney Co Inc. waited more than two years to admit that they were victims in 2007 of notorious hacker Albert Gonzalez, who was accused of masterminding the theft and reselling of millions of credit cards and ATM numbers. During his trial the companies were represented by lawyers who did not identify their clients as Target and J.C Penney. Doug Johnson, vice president of risk management policy with the American Bankers Association, said banks and credit card firms like Visa are forbidden from naming merchants that have been breached, unless they disclose it themselves. “It is really frustrating to the bank and also the customer,” Johnson said. One of the sources who told Reuters about the recent rash of attacks said the memory parsing malware cited in the Visa reports was among the tools that the hackers had used, but said they used other techniques as well. Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said the retailer is not commenting on the company’s investigation of the breach. “This continues to be an active and ongoing investigation. It would be inappropriate to discuss details at this point.” Avivah Litan, a security analyst for Stamford, Connecticut -based Gartner information technology research firm, said she learned about a separate set of breaches, dating back no more than a few months before the November 28 Thanksgiving Day start of the holiday shopping season, from a forensics investigator. She declined to provide his name. “Target was not the only retailer who got hit, but they got hit the biggest,” Litan said. Investigators believe that the early series of attacks on retailers staged before late November were mostly used as trial attacks to help the hackers perfect new techniques they then used against Target, stealing payment cards at unprecedented speed, Litan said. Chris Gray, director of Denver, Colorado -based Accuvant information security firm’s risk and compliance practice, said that sophisticated cyber crime groups do that because they only have once chance to get it right before victims catch on. “You want to test it and make sure it works,” Gray said. “Then you push it out at the appropriate time and do as much damage as you can.” ",1122014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-target-databreach-retailers/exclusive-more-well-known-u-s-retailers-victims-of-cyber-attacks-sources-idUSBREA0B01720140112
341,TGT,House Democrats request probe into Target card breach,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic members of the Financial Services Committee of the House of Representatives have called on the panel to investigate the hacking of credit and debit card data belonging to millions of customers of retailer Target Corp. The request piggybacks on a similar move by Senate Democrats on Friday as lawmakers respond to the massive breach at Target, the No. 3 U.S. retailer, during the holiday shopping season, which resulted in the theft of about 40 million credit and debit card records and 70 million other records containing customer information. In a letter to Jeb Hensarling, the committee’s Republican chairman, 17 committee Democrats, led by ranking member Maxine Waters, asked for a “full Financial Services Committee hearing.” It was unclear whether the committee’s Republican majority would respond to the request. The letter said a hearing should review current consumer protection laws and determine what could be done to ensure the future security of consumers’ card information. “It is incumbent upon our Committee to explore whether industry data protection standards are appropriate, and examine whether heightened regulatory standards are needed to more effectively protect consumers,” the Democrats wrote. After the request from Senate Democrats last week, Senate Banking Committee leaders have confirmed they plan to hold a hearing on data security issues in late January. Senate Commerce committee chairman Jay Rockefeller is also facing calls for a hearing. Although the hearings would allow for an airing of grievances and potentially bring Target officials to Washington for a grilling about how the case has been handled, they would not necessarily result in taking any kind of action or in legislation. A bill by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy remains the only data security bill on tap for now. One of the co-signers, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, told Reuters on Friday that he “will be talking to my colleagues about measures that may complement the Leahy bill.” The National Association of Federal Credit Unions on Monday sent letters to Congressional leaders, demanding action on data security. The Federal Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission and state attorneys general would potentially look into Target’s actions in this situation. The FTC does not confirm or deny the existence of ongoing investigations and would only get involved if Target is shown to have failed to protect its customers’ data. Target has said it is working in partnership with the Secret Service, the lead agency involved in the data breach case, and the Department of Justice but did not comment on any FTC involvement. In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange Target shares were down 1.58 percent at $61.60, outpacing the overall market decline.

342,TGT,"Target apologizes for data breach, retailers embrace security upgrade","BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Target Corp began a major public relations effort on Monday to apologize to customers for an unprecedented cyber attack on its network, but the No. 3 U.S. retailer was vague in providing details about what it knew and when. The company has so far disclosed that the breach started in late November and lasted 19 days over the peak holiday shopping season, resulting in the theft of about 40 million credit card records and 70 million other records containing customer data. Target is trying to woo back customers after sales dropped off at the end of the holiday season. Its campaign included full-page newspaper advertisements on Monday apologizing for the attack and the first interview since the breach by chief executive Gregg Steinhafel. He told CNBC TV business network that Target wanted to lead the retail industry’s move to adopt payment card technology that stores customer information on computer chips and requires users to type in personal identification numbers. On Sunday, a top executive with the National Retail Federation called for tougher security standards that could mean more spending for the industry, its banks and business partners following the breaches at Target and other retailers in the United States. Steinhafel said he was proud of the way Target employees had responded once the breach was confirmed, yet he provided few details about what had happened. Target disclosed on December 19 that it was victim to one of the biggest credit card breaches on record. It said it ran for 19 days in the busy holiday shopping season through December 15. “We’re going to get to the bottom of this,” Steinhafel told CNBC. “We’re not going to rest until we understand what happened and how that happened.” The company declined to say precisely when it first came to suspect its systems might have been compromised. In the CNBC interview, Steinhafel said the company “confirmed” that it had been victim of a breach on December 15, but he provided no account of what happened in preceding weeks. “December 15. That was the day we confirmed that we had an issue,” he said. Sources familiar with the investigation have previously told Reuters that Target learned about the attack only after receiving warnings from financial industry sources who reported seeing a surge in fraudulent credit card activity from accounts of customers who had shopped at the retailer. Another retailer, Neiman Marcus, disclosed on Friday that it was warned about a possible breach in mid-December and that an outside forensics firm confirmed a breach on January 1, saying it found evidence that some payment card data may have been compromised. Target and Neiman Marcus are not the only U.S. retailers whose networks were breached over the holidays, according to sources familiar with attacks on other merchants that have yet to be publicly disclosed. Smaller breaches at least three other well-known U.S. retailers took place over the holiday season and were conducted using similar techniques as the one on Target, according to the people familiar with the attacks. Similar breaches may have occurred earlier last year. Stores and card processing companies have reported a steady stream of security breaches for years without a major backlash from consumers, such as those disclosed by TJX Cos in 2007 and by Heartland Payment Systems Inc in 2009. But the latest thefts could mark a watershed moment for security standards as calls grow for changes in the protection of consumer information. ‘CHIP-AND-PIN’ CARDS One sign of the change is the new enthusiasm for “Chip-and-PIN” payment cards, which have computer chips built into them and require users to type in PINs. Mallory Duncan, general counsel of the National Retail Federation that represents Target, Wal-Mart and other stores, said on Sunday that the trade group encouraged its members to upgrade to the higher-security cards even though they cost more than old systems that store data on magnetic stripes. The breaches are “unfortunate but we’re not entirely surprised,” Duncan said at his organization’s annual convention in New York. “The technology that exists in cards out there is 20th-century technology and we’ve got 21st-century hackers,” he said. Duncan said the trade group had only made its backing for the higher-security cards public since the Target breach. Banks have quietly begun to offer the cards but mainly for customers to use while traveling. Big U.S. card networks led by Visa Inc will not require the higher security until next year at the earliest. It is not clear that “Chip-and-PIN” technology would have prevented the breaches at Target and elsewhere. At the very least they make stolen data harder to re-use, a reason the technology has caught on widely in Europe and Asia. They have met with much less enthusiasm in the United States, in part because losses to fraud - just 5 cents for every $100 spent via plastic - have been manageable for merchants and their banks.

343,TGT,US House Democrats request probe into Target card breach,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic members of the Financial Services Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives have called on the panel to investigate the hacking of credit and debit card data belonging to millions of customers of retailer Target Corp. The request piggybacks on a similar move by Senate Democrats on Friday as lawmakers respond to the massive breach at Target, the No. 3 U.S. retailer, during the holiday shopping season, which resulted in the theft of about 40 million credit and debit card records and 70 million other records containing customer information. In a letter to Jeb Hensarling, the committee’s Republican chairman, 17 committee Democrats, led by ranking member Maxine Waters, asked for a “full Financial Services Committee hearing.” It was unclear whether the committee’s Republican majority would respond to the request. The letter said a hearing should review current consumer protection laws and determine what could be done to ensure the future security of consumers’ card information. “It is incumbent upon our Committee to explore whether industry data protection standards are appropriate, and examine whether heightened regulatory standards are needed to more effectively protect consumers,” the Democrats wrote. After the request from Senate Democrats last week, Senate Banking Committee leaders have confirmed they plan to hold a hearing on data security issues in late January. Senate Commerce committee chairman Jay Rockefeller is also facing calls for a hearing. Although the hearings would allow for an airing of grievances and potentially bring Target officials to Washington for a grilling about how the case has been handled, they would not necessarily result in taking any kind of action or in legislation. A bill by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy remains the only data security bill on tap for now. One of the co-signers, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, told Reuters on Friday that he “will be talking to my colleagues about measures that may complement the Leahy bill.” The National Association of Federal Credit Unions on Monday sent letters to Congressional leaders, demanding action on data security. The Federal Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission and state attorneys general would potentially look into Target’s actions in this situation. The FTC does not confirm or deny the existence of ongoing investigations and would only get involved if Target is shown to have failed to protect its customers’ data. Target has said it is working in partnership with the Secret Service, the lead agency involved in the data breach case, and the Department of Justice but did not comment on any FTC involvement.

345,TGT,"UPDATE 1-Target apologizes for data breach, retailers embrace security upgrade","By Ross Kerber, Phil Wahba and Jim Finkle BOSTON/NEW YORK, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Target Corp  began a major public relations effort on Monday to apologize to customers for an unprecedented cyber attack on its network, but the No. 3 U.S. retailer was vague in providing details about what it knew and when. The company has so far disclosed that the breach started in late November and lasted 19 days over the peak holiday shopping season, resulting in the theft of about 40 million credit card records and 70 million other records containing customer data. Target is trying to woo back customers after sales dropped off at the end of the holiday season. Its campaign included full-page newspaper advertisements on Monday apologizing for the attack and the first interview since the breach by chief executive Gregg Steinhafel. He told CNBC TV business network that Target wanted to lead the retail industry’s move to adopt payment card technology that stores customer information on computer chips and requires users to type in personal identification numbers. On Sunday, a top executive with the National Retail Federation called for tougher security standards that could mean more spending for the industry, its banks and business partners following the breaches at Target and other retailers in the United States. Steinhafel said he was proud of the way Target employees had responded once the breach was confirmed, yet he provided few details about what had happened. Target disclosed on Dec. 19 that it was victim to one of the biggest credit card breaches on record. It said it ran for 19 days in the busy holiday shopping season through Dec. 15. “We’re going to get to the bottom of this,” Steinhafel told CNBC. “We’re not going to rest until we understand what happened and how that happened.” The company declined to say precisely when it first came to suspect its systems might have been compromised. In the CNBC interview, Steinhafel said the company “confirmed” that it had been victim of a breach on Dec. 15, but he provided no account of what happened in preceding weeks. “December 15. That was the day we confirmed that we had an issue,” he said. Sources familiar with the investigation have previously told Reuters that Target learned about the attack only after receiving warnings from financial industry sources who reported seeing a surge in fraudulent credit card activity from accounts of customers who had shopped at the retailer. Another retailer, Neiman Marcus, disclosed on Friday that it was warned about a possible breach in mid-December and that an outside forensics firm confirmed a breach on Jan. 1, saying it found evidence that some payment card data may have been compromised. Target and Neiman Marcus are not the only U.S. retailers whose networks were breached over the holidays, according to sources familiar with attacks on other merchants that have yet to be publicly disclosed. Smaller breaches at least three other well-known U.S. retailers took place over the holiday season and were conducted using similar techniques as the one on Target, according to the people familiar with the attacks. Similar breaches may have occurred earlier last year. Stores and card processing companies have reported a steady stream of security breaches for years without a major backlash from consumers, such as those disclosed by TJX Cos in 2007 and by Heartland Payment Systems Inc in 2009. But the latest thefts could mark a watershed moment for security standards as calls grow for changes in the protection of consumer information. ‘CHIP-AND-PIN’ CARDS One sign of the change is the new enthusiasm for “Chip-and-PIN” payment cards, which have computer chips built into them and require users to type in PINs. Mallory Duncan, general counsel of the National Retail Federation that represents Target, Wal-Mart and other stores, said on Sunday that the trade group encouraged its members to upgrade to the higher-security cards even though they cost more than old systems that store data on magnetic stripes. The breaches are “unfortunate but we’re not entirely surprised,” Duncan said at his organization’s annual convention in New York. “The technology that exists in cards out there is 20th-century technology and we’ve got 21st-century hackers,” he said. Duncan said the trade group had only made its backing for the higher-security cards public since the Target breach. Banks have quietly begun to offer the cards but mainly for customers to use while traveling. Big U.S. card networks led by Visa Inc  will not require the higher security until next year at the earliest. It is not clear that “Chip-and-PIN” technology would have prevented the breaches at Target and elsewhere. At the very least they make stolen data harder to re-use, a reason the technology has caught on widely in Europe and Asia. They have met with much less enthusiasm in the United States, in part because losses to fraud - just 5 cents for every $100 spent via plastic - have been manageable for merchants and their banks.

Malware was installed on the company’s point of sale registers, Gregg Steinhafel said, and Target was working with law enforcement agencies investigating the breach. “As time goes on, we’re going to get to the bottom of this,” he said. “We’re not going to rest until we understand what happened and how that happened. “Clearly, we’re accountable and we’re responsible but we’re going to come out at the end of this a better company and we’re going to make significant changes.” Steinhafel did not give details of the planned changes. “We are in the middle of a criminal investigation as you can appreciate and we can only share so much,” he told CNBC. Target said on Friday an investigation found that hackers stole the personal information of at least 70 million customers, including names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses. Previously, the No. 3 U.S. retailer said the hackers stole data from 40 million credit and debit cards. Steinhafel told CNBC he had no idea who was responsible for the breach but that Target’s environment was now secure. “We have no evidence that there is any other guest information that was removed from our environment,” he said. On Friday Minneapolis-based Target, the No. 3 U.S. retailer, lowered its fourth-quarter profit forecast to between $1.20 and $1.30 from $1.50 to $1.60, in part due to weaker-than-expected sales since reports of the cyber-attack emerged.

350,TGT,UPDATE 3-U.S. senators ask Target CEO for information on data breach,"By Mark Hosenball and Ros Krasny WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators were seeking answers on Tuesday from the chief executive of Target Corp about the company’s response to the hacking of credit and debit cards of millions of its customers during the holiday shopping season. “We ask that Target’s information-security officials provide a briefing to committee staff regarding your company’s investigation and latest findings,” said John Rockefeller, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and Claire McCaskill, who heads a Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection. The Democratic senators’ Jan. 10 letter to Target CEO Gregg Steinhafel was released on Tuesday, the latest in a growing chorus of calls by lawmakers and others for inquiries into the hacking of the No. 3 U.S. retailer. “We have received the chairmen’s letter and are continuing to work with them and other elected officials to keep them informed and updated as our investigation continues,” Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said in an email to Reuters. Shortly afterwards, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee sought a hearing on the theft of about 40 million credit and debit card records and 70 million other records containing customer information. Representative Elijah Cummings said the committee’s focus  since October has been investigating the security of the federal government’s health insurance website, HealthCare.gov, which has not been breached. He urged the committee chairman, Republican Darrell Issa, who made a fortune as head of a company that makes car alarms and other automotive security devices, to turn his attention to Target. “In addition to serving the interests of millions of American consumers affected by this breach, I believe the committee could learn from these witnesses about their failures, successes and best practices in order to better secure our federal information technology systems,” Cummings wrote. An aide to Issa told Reuters the committee was likely to “do some follow up” on the Target issue. Target disclosed on Dec. 19 that it was a victim of one of the biggest credit card breaches on record, which it said lasted for 19 days in the busy holiday shopping season through Dec. 15. The company on Monday apologized for the breach. “It has been three weeks since the data breach was discovered, and new information continues to come out,” Rockefeller and McCaskill wrote. “We expect that your security experts have had time to fully examine the cause and impact of the breach and will be able to provide the Committee with detailed information.” The Target hacking shows the need for federal legislation on commercial data practices, the senators said. Democratic lawmakers sought a congressional hearing on Monday from the Financial Services Committee. Its Republican chairman, Jeb Hensarling, said his panel will continue to hold  hearings on the security of financial information and on how to protect personal consumer information. “Americans have a right to expect that the personal information they turn over to private companies and government agencies will be protected and kept secure from loss, unauthorized access or misuse,” Hensarling said in a statement. Separately, an official with the House Energy and Commerce committee’s majority Republicans said that one of its subcommittees has held numerous hearings on data breaches and that it was monitoring the Target situation but has taken no specific action. The National Association of Federal Credit Unions sent letters on Monday to congressional leaders, demanding action on data security. Although congressional hearings would allow for an airing of grievances and could bring Target officials to Washington for questioning about how the case has been handled, they would not necessarily result in any action or in legislation. Steinhafel told CNBC television on Monday: “We’re going to get to the bottom of this. We’re not going to rest until we understand what happened and how that happened.” Target shares closed at $61.70, up 0.3 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange.",1142014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-target-senators/update-3-u-s-senators-ask-target-ceo-for-information-on-data-breach-idUSL2N0KO12Z20140114
351,TGT,What Target customers should know about identity theft protection,"(Reuters) - In the wake of a massive data breach that affected up to 100 million shoppers over the holidays, Target Corp has offered all of its customers - whether or not they were directly affected - a year of free credit monitoring. Is it an offer you should take? Here are some questions and answers about what this sort of protection does - and does not - do and what you should keep in mind if you do sign up. Q: What is Target offering? A: One year of free credit monitoring from the credit bureau Experian if you request an authorization code from Target and activate it by April 30. Q: What does that give me? A: In addition to getting a copy of a credit report from Experian, consumers will be notified when there are changes to their credit history. Such changes include applications for credit and any new accounts that are added. Every consumer is entitled to a free copy of their credit report once a year from each of the three major credit bureaus - Experian, Equifax and Transunion. The official website to get that free report is AnnualCreditReport.com. Some experts recommend getting one every four months so you have a greater opportunity to see any unwelcome activity sooner. If a consumer is a victim of identity theft they will also be provided with assistance from Experian to help resolve the tangle that typically follows. It can take a lot of effort and time to distance yourself from the fraud and clean up your credit history. The free service offered by Target does not provide a credit score, however. That is available for an additional fee. Q: What happens after one year? A: You would have to pay for the service for it to continue. It costs about $16 a month. Q: The offer from Target includes $1 million of identity theft insurance coverage. What protection does that offer? A: The insurance is very limited in scope, mainly covering incidental expenses, not monetary loss, notes Susan Grant, director of consumer protection for the Consumer Federation of America. While it includes coverage for lost wages from time spent repairing your damaged credit in the event of identity theft, that protection is capped at $1,000 a week for four weeks. The only instance in which you could be covered for an actual loss is if funds are electronically transferred from your account. Q: Will this service protect me from having my identity stolen or fraudulent charges on my cards? A: No. “It’s essentially a notification service,” says John Breyault, vice president of the National Consumers League. It’s still up to consumers to be vigilant about checking their accounts and to take action if there is any unauthorized activity. Consumers also need to be wary of scammers seeking to get even more information from them based on what they already have from the Target breach or other breaches, like e-mail addresses and phone numbers. Thieves are seeking your Social Security number - something Target has said was not revealed in this breach. If they can talk you out of that information, it is possible they can open credit lines in your name, says Tim Rohrbaugh, chief information security officer at Intersections Inc., an identity theft prevention company. Having credit monitoring won’t protect you from this, but you will be alerted if it happens. “It doesn’t give you license to discard common sense and start clicking on embedded links in e-mails and coughing up all sorts of personal information,” says Robert Siciliano, a security expert for the online security company McAfee. Q: How do I sign up safely? A: Go directly to Target's website, which has a link (creditmonitoring.target.com) where customers can request an authorization code to activate the service. It could take up to five days to get a code, but at least initially the codes are coming within minutes. That e-mail explains how to sign up. Signing up will, ironically, require consumers to input more information - including their Social Security numbers. Beth Givens, executive director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, says the advocacy group recommends consumers get the protection but noted that in situations like this, many are reluctant to give out their Social Security number. “I hope that Experian’s security is adequate, but how do any of us know for sure?,” says Grant, of the Consumer Federation of America. Q: So, should I sign up? A: Consumer advocates and security experts say it can be helpful to sign up. But they caution: don’t expect it to be a magic solution.

353,TGT,"RPT-Target, other U.S. breaches may spur security spending -executives","By Ross Kerber BOSTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - A rash of data breaches at big U.S. retailers may accelerate spending on high-tech payment cards, a MasterCard Inc executive and other industry specialists said on Monday, as companies look to keep the faith of their customers. Retailers and their banks face a deadline set by payment networks Visa Inc and MasterCard of October 2015 to accept new payment cards that store information on computer chips rather than on traditional magnetic stripes. The multibillion-dollar safety upgrade has many companies dragging their feet, and analysts estimated only 60 percent of U.S. sales terminals would meet the schedule. Now the loss of customer data reported at Target Corp, Neiman Marcus and other stores since December could move companies to the new standard more quickly, said Carolyn Balfany, head of U.S. product delivery for MasterCard in a telephone interview on Monday. The risks created by the breaches will clarify to companies the benefit of moving quickly to the new standard, she said. “That’s the clarity,” she said. Among companies that could profit from a faster switch to chip-based cards are those that make equipment used to swipe them, such as the United States’ VeriFone Systems Inc  and France’s Ingenico. MasterCard, of Purchase, N.Y., is the second-largest payment network operator behind Visa of Foster City, California. Visa has not made executives available to be interviewed since Target first reported its breach on Dec. 19. A response gaining attention among security specialists has been the conversion of U.S. sales terminals to a card standard widely used in Europe and Asia, sometimes known as “EMV” after the initials of its creator companies Europay, MasterCard and Visa. Cards meeting the standard carry chips to make them harder to counterfeit, and to protect sensitive data with encryption. They can also require users to enter a personal identification number, or PIN, to make purchases, an extra layer of security compared to the signatures used by traditional credit cards. Although the new technology may not have prevented the data thefts from Target and elsewhere, it would make any stolen data harder to re-use and has cut fraud where it has been adopted. In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Target Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel said the company wanted to lead the retail industry’s move to adopt the new cards. His remarks echoed those made by the general counsel of the National Retail Federation on Sunday. [ ID: nL2N0KN110 ] To date U.S. banks and retailers have been at odds over who should bear the costs of the upgrades, which could approach $10 billion in all. Retailers have made headway with a federal lawsuit that could help them reduce the fees that banks can charge to process transactions - fees the banks had counted on to pay for new technology. [ ID:nL2N0K004A ] The new enthusiasm from retailers like Target and the trade group after the breaches could mean they will install the equipment more quickly, said Roel Schouwenberg, a senior cyber security researcher for Kaspersky Lab. “If EMV now receives a broad industry push then I don’t see why we couldn’t beat some of the set deadlines,” he said. The cost of switching would have to cover new sales terminals and the issuing of new plastic to replace the roughly 1.1 billion credit, debit and prepaid cards now circulating in the United States. A traditional card costs about $1 to print, personalize and mail to a consumer, whereas the new cards can cost up to $10 each depending on the volume printed and the memory in their chips, estimated Javelin Strategy analyst Al Pascual. Still, the changes are coming. Large banks have begun to mail new chip cards to customers for traveling including Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co..

354,TGT,"Target, other U.S. breaches may spur security spending -executives","BOSTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - A rash of data breaches at big U.S. retailers may accelerate spending on high-tech payment cards, a MasterCard Inc executive and other industry specialists said on Monday, as companies look to keep the faith of their customers. Retailers and their banks face a deadline set by payment networks Visa Inc and MasterCard of October 2015 to accept new payment cards that store information on computer chips rather than on traditional magnetic stripes. The multibillion-dollar safety upgrade has many companies dragging their feet, and analysts estimated only 60 percent of U.S. sales terminals would meet the schedule. Now the loss of customer data reported at Target Corp, Neiman Marcus and other stores since December could move companies to the new standard more quickly, said Carolyn Balfany, head of U.S. product delivery for MasterCard in a telephone interview on Monday. The risks created by the breaches will clarify to companies the benefit of moving quickly to the new standard, she said. “That’s the clarity,” she said. Among companies that could profit from a faster switch to chip-based cards are those that make equipment used to swipe them, such as the United States’ VeriFone Systems Inc  and France’s Ingenico. MasterCard, of Purchase, N.Y., is the second-largest payment network operator behind Visa of Foster City, California. Visa has not made executives available to be interviewed since Target first reported its breach on Dec. 19. A response gaining attention among security specialists has been the conversion of U.S. sales terminals to a card standard widely used in Europe and Asia, sometimes known as “EMV” after the initials of its creator companies Europay, MasterCard and Visa. Cards meeting the standard carry chips to make them harder to counterfeit, and to protect sensitive data with encryption. They can also require users to enter a personal identification number, or PIN, to make purchases, an extra layer of security compared to the signatures used by traditional credit cards. Although the new technology may not have prevented the data thefts from Target and elsewhere, it would make any stolen data harder to re-use and has cut fraud where it has been adopted. In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Target Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel said the company wanted to lead the retail industry’s move to adopt the new cards. His remarks echoed those made by the general counsel of the National Retail Federation on Sunday. [ ID: nL2N0KN110 ] To date U.S. banks and retailers have been at odds over who should bear the costs of the upgrades, which could approach $10 billion in all. Retailers have made headway with a federal lawsuit that could help them reduce the fees that banks can charge to process transactions - fees the banks had counted on to pay for new technology. [ ID:nL2N0K004A ] The new enthusiasm from retailers like Target and the trade group after the breaches could mean they will install the equipment more quickly, said Roel Schouwenberg, a senior cyber security researcher for Kaspersky Lab. “If EMV now receives a broad industry push then I don’t see why we couldn’t beat some of the set deadlines,” he said. The cost of switching would have to cover new sales terminals and the issuing of new plastic to replace the roughly 1.1 billion credit, debit and prepaid cards now circulating in the United States. A traditional card costs about $1 to print, personalize and mail to a consumer, whereas the new cards can cost up to $10 each depending on the volume printed and the memory in their chips, estimated Javelin Strategy analyst Al Pascual. Still, the changes are coming. Large banks have begun to mail new chip cards to customers for traveling including Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co.. Big equipment makers like VeriFone and Ingenico have already wound down sales of their older magnetic-stripe-only card readers in the U.S. Thierry Denis, president of Ingenico’s North American unit, said the breaches have focused attention on the retailers to upgrade their systems but that banks also need to issue the cards customers will need for the new card readers to catch on. “It’s chicken and egg,” he said.

355,TGT,RPT-Target data breach could be costly for payment partners,"By Ross Kerber BOSTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Companies that help Target Corp  process payments could face millions of dollars in fines and costs resulting from the unprecedented data breach that struck the retailer over the holiday shopping season. Investigators are still sorting through just how thieves  compromised about 40 million payment cards and the information of about 70 million Target customers. But people who have reviewed past data breaches believe Target’s partners could face consumer lawsuits and fines that payment networks such as  Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc often levy after cyber security incidents. Target’s partners “have deep pockets and are intimately involved in certain aspects of how Target gets paid,” said Jamie Pole, a cyber security consultant in Asheboro, North Carolina, who works for government agencies and the financial industry. Fines and settlement costs could reach into the millions of dollars for individual companies, he said, though much will depend on how the ultimate liability for the breach is determined. Boston attorney Cynthia Larose of Mintz Levin said Target would likely seek to add its partners as defendants to lawsuits already filed over the breach. “These class-action lawsuits start to bring everyone in at some point,” she said. After its systems were penetrated by hackers in the mid-2000s, retailer TJX Companies Inc agreed to pay up to $40.9 million to cover fraud costs in a settlement with Visa. Visa also issued penalties of $880,000 against Fifth Third Bancorp of Ohio, which processed transactions for TJX. Asked about the business relationships and possible costs, Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation and pending suits. A Visa spokeswoman declined to comment. A MasterCard spokesman said the company could not discuss an ongoing investigation. Several companies are involved in any purchase from a store such as Target. A bank issues the consumer’s payment card, while a separate organization known as the “merchant acquirer” handles the payment for the store, when the card is swiped. Companies such as Visa and MasterCard operate the networks over which the payment request and confirmation are sent. Companies performing these roles for Target were identified in a research note by Robert W. Baird & Co analysts on Dec. 19. According to the note the merchant acquirer used by Target for credit and debit card transactions is Bank of America Merchant Services, a joint venture of Bank of America Corp  and KKR & Co’s First Data Corp. A spokesman for the joint venture declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Bank of America. Bank of America is due to release earnings on Wednesday morning. A spokeswoman for First Data, Nancy Etheredge, said via email that the company “processes some transactions for one of Target’s merchant acquirers” but declined to offer more detail. The note also identified Vantiv Inc of Cincinnati as processing transactions for Target customers who type in personal identification numbers for debit transactions. It said Vantiv expected “no impact from the breach.” Vantiv representatives did not return messages. Target-branded payment cards are issued by Toronto’s TD Bank Group. A spokeswoman said via e-mail that “It would be inappropriate to comment on any potential fines at this time.” One author of the Baird report, analyst Timothy Wojs, said it is too soon to predict what fines or settlement costs might result. In the past, fines by Visa and MasterCard have been insignificant to payment processors but set the stage for larger settlements to cover bank losses, he said. Fines in cyber cases have drawn some push-back from merchants. In a case in U.S. District Court in Nashville, Tennessee, specialty retailer Genesco Inc Inc is suing Visa over the $13.3 million it says Visa wrongfully collected from its banks, Wells Fargo & Co and Fifth Third. Visa collected the money after a cyber-attack obtained payment data, though the data was handled within industry standards, according to the company’s complaint. Wells Fargo declined to comment.

The report titled “Indicators for Network Defenders” brings to light some of the first information gleaned from the government’s highly secretive probes into the Target breach and other retail hacks, including details useful for detecting malicious programs that elude anti-virus software. “It’s a shame this report wasn’t released a month ago,” said Dmitri Alperovitch, chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. “It has been frustrating for some retailers because it has been incredibly difficult for most firms to get information. It has not been forthcoming.” No. 3 U.S. retailer Target disclosed the theft of some 40 million payment card numbers and the personal data of 70 million customers in a cyber attack that occurred over the holiday shopping season. Neiman Marcus last week said that it too was victim of a cyber attack, and sources have told Reuters that at least three other well-known national retailers have been attacked.. The document noted that an underground market for malicious software to attack point-of-sale, or POS, terminals has flourished in recent years. Three of the most popular titles for the malicious software include BlackPOS, Dexter and vSkimmer. “We believe there is a strong market for the development of POS malware, and evidence suggests there is a growing demand,” the report, obtained by Reuters, warned. The Secret Service, which is heading up the investigations into the cyber attacks, has declined to comment on what it has learned or identify victims besides Target and Neiman Marcus. John Watters, chief executive of the security intelligence firm iSIGHT Partners, which helped draft the document released on Thursday, said that the government decided to provide information to retailers so they can determine whether their systems have been compromised by hackers. “The point of getting the technical artifacts out there is that people can go out there and examine their systems and see if they have been compromised,” said Watters, whose firm has helped the Secret Service in its investigations of retail breaches. “Now they are armed with information and they can go do something about it.” A Department of Homeland Security official said the report was drafted to provide the industry “with relevant and actionable technical indicators for network defense.” The document said that an advanced piece of software dubbed the POSRAM Trojan, was used in the recent attacks. POSRAM is an type of RAM scraper, or memory-parsing software, which enables cyber criminals to grab encrypted data by capturing it when it travels through the live memory of a computer, where it appears in plain text. While the technology has been around for many years, its use has increased in recent years as retailers have improved their security, making it more difficult for hackers to obtain credit card data using other approaches. POSRAM succeeded in evading detection by anti-virus software when it infected the Windows-based point-of-sales terminals, according to the report. “This report was generated so that we could get it into the hands of commercial entities so that they had information they needed to protect themselves,” iSIGHT Partners Senior Vice President Tiffany Jones told Reuters.

362,TGT,UPDATE 2-American Express says exposure to Target breach 'minimal',"* Fourth-quarter adjusted earnings $1.25/share vs est. $1.26/share * Revenue up 5 pct at $8.55 bln * Says has fraud controls on accounts affected by Target breach By Aman Shah Jan 16 (Reuters) - Credit card company American Express Co , which reported strong quarterly results on Thursday, said it had seen ‘minimal exposure’ to the data breach at Target Corp stores during the U.S. holiday shopping season. American Express said it had fraud controls in place on accounts affected in the theft, one of the biggest card breaches on record. About 40 million credit card records and 70 million other records containing data on Target’s customers were stolen in the breach disclosed in December. “The closed-loop is a big advantage for us, especially in situations like this,” Chief Financial Officer Jeff Campbell said on a post-earnings conference call, referring to the company’s system of issuing its own cards in addition to processing transactions. Earlier in the day, American Express reported a two-fold jump in fourth-quarter profit as its affluent customers spent more in the U.S. holiday season and fewer users defaulted on payments. “We ended the year on a strong note, with card member spending up 8 percent despite mixed reports during the holiday shopping season,” Chief Executive Ken Chenault said in a statement. Concerns over debit and credit card safety have increased after Target, the third-largest U.S. retailer, disclosed the breach that lasted 19 days through Dec. 15. Cards on American Express’s platform are seen as safer than those on Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc platforms due to the ‘closed loop’ system. American Express benefited from the holiday shopping season in the United States, with billed business in its core market growing 9 percent in the quarter ended Dec. 31, the highest growth in six quarters. “Even though overall growth in consumer spending has been somewhat muted, the fact that American Express focuses on affluent consumers is helping it grow its billed business,” said Janney Capital Markets analyst Sameer Gokhale. U.S. retail sales increased 3.8 percent in the 2013 holiday season, according to data released by the National Retail Federation on Tuesday. The same day, the U.S. Commerce Department said retail sales including automobiles, gasoline stations and restaurants rose 1 percent from a year earlier in the October-December period. () American Express, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, said fewer customers defaulted on payments in the quarter, with worldwide net lending write-off rate falling to 1.6 percent from 2 percent, a year earlier. Delinquency rates at credit card companies usually rise in the fourth quarter as customers spend more during the holiday season and then find it difficult to repay loans. American Express’s net profit rose to $1.31 billion, or $1.21 per share, in the quarter from $637 million, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding merchant litigation settlements reached last month, earnings were $1.25 per share. Total revenue, net of interest expense, increased 5 percent to $8.55 billion. Analysts on average had expected the company to earn $1.26 per share on revenue of $8.54 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. American Express shares gained about 55 percent in 2013, outperforming the broader S&P; 500 Index, which rose 30 percent in the year.

363,TGT,Neiman Marcus computers were hacked as far back as July - NYT,"Jan 17 (Reuters) - Hackers breached the computer networks of luxury department store chain Neiman Marcus as far back as July, an attack that was not fully contained until Sunday, the New York Times reported, citing people briefed on the investigation. Neiman Marcus said on Friday that hackers may have stolen customers’ credit and debit card information, the second cyber attack on a retailer in recent weeks. Neiman Marcus had said it first learned in mid-December of suspicious activity that involved credit cards used at its stores. However, in a call with credit card companies on Monday, Neiman acknowledged that the attack had only been fully contained a day earlier, and that the time stamp on the first intrusion was in mid-July, the paper said. () Neiman Marcus spokeswoman Ginger Reeder declined to comment to Reuters on the New York Times report about the July hack attack. “We did not get our first alert that there might be something wrong until mid-December. We didn’t find evidence until Jan. 1,” Reeder told Reuters late on Thursday. Neiman Marcus did not say how many credit cards were affected but said that customer social security numbers and birth dates were not compromised. “Customers that shopped online do not appear at this time to have been impacted by the criminal cyber-security intrusion. Your PIN was never at risk because we do not use PIN pads in our stores,” Chief Executive Karen Katz wrote in a letter to customers, a copy of which was posted on the company’s website. Katz said the company has taken steps to contain the situation, including working with federal law enforcement, disabling the malware and enhancing security tools. The company is also assessing and reinforcing its related payment card systems, Katz said.

365,TGT,"Secret Service probes link between border arrests, Target data breach","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Secret Service said on Tuesday it was checking for links between the recent hacking of consumer data from Target Corp and the weekend arrest of two Mexicans who tried to enter the United States at a Texas border crossing with a cache of fraudulent credit cards. But other law enforcement sources said it was not clear whether there was a link between the Target data breach and the arrests, which occurred at the U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas. Edwin Donovan, a spokesman for the Secret Service in Washington D.C., confirmed that the agency was looking for any connection between Target data breach and the two Mexicans. Target has said a breach of its networks during the busy holiday shopping period resulted in the theft of about 40 million credit and debit card records and 70 million other records with customer information such as addresses and telephone numbers. “The U.S. Secret Service continues to work closely with affected parties and law enforcement to investigate the Target breach. In regards to the arrest announced yesterday, the Secret Service is working with the U.S. Attorney’s Office and McAllen Police Department to determine if there is any connection,” Donovan said in an email. Three law enforcement sources familiar with the matter said there were indications that any connection between the Target breach and the man and woman could turn out to be insignificant and indirect. One possible explanation, they said, is that the arrested pair somehow acquired credit card or other data stolen from Target over the Internet and had no real knowledge or involvement, other than as data purchasers, of the people who originally carried out the hack, who investigators say may be based in Eastern Europe. Reports from McAllen quoted Victor Rodriguez, the local police chief, as saying that Mary Carmen Garcia Vaquera, 27, and Daniel Guardiola Dominguez, 28, both from Monterrey, Mexico, had been detained and charged with fraud related to the Target hack. Rodriguez was quoted by the Wall Street Journal saying that the pair had used credit card data stolen from Target to purchase tens of thousands of dollars worth of goods from Walmart, Best Buy and other stores in South Texas. The Los Angeles Times quoted another McAllen police spokesman as saying the two detained individuals had been carrying 90 fraudulent credit cards and another 22 that were found later.

367,TGT,"South Koreans seethe, sue as credit card details swiped","SEOUL (Reuters) - The theft of personal information from more than 100 million South Korean credit cards and accounts, reportedly including those of President Park Geun-hye and UN chief Ban Ki-moon, has ignited a storm of anger and litigation against credit firms. Worried Koreans on Tuesday packed into branches of one of the banks hit by the theft to ensure their money was safe, while lawyers said 130 people joined a class action suit against their credit card providers in what is expected to be the first of multiple litigations. “Of course I’m angry. Anyone might know when I pay my credit card bills, let alone my phone number and where I live. I might as well keep all my money in my closet,” said one card user, Lee Young-hye, outside a bank branch. The biggest breach of personal privacy ever in South Korea has further highlighted the vulnerability of credit card information after tens of millions of U.S. cardholders’ details were stolen from retailer Target Corp during the holiday shopping season. South Koreans on average have more than four credit cards, something that has contributed to one of the highest levels of personal debt relative to the size of the economy in the developed world. The data security breach affected around 15 million cardholders, according to official estimates, by far the largest in a series of such scams against financial firms in South Korea going back to 2011. Some previous attacks involved hackers believed to originate from North Korea, but this one seems to have been an inside job. Financial regulators said a contractor with the Korea Credit Bureau, a private firm that manages the credit information of millions of Koreans for financial services providers, simply loaded details of 105.8 million accounts held by KB Kookmin Card Co Ltd, Lotte Card Co Ltd and NH Nonghyup Card onto a portable hard drive. The technician was allegedly working on forgery-proofing credit cards when he committed the theft in February, June and December last year, according to regulator Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), citing the prosecutor’s office leading the investigation. The man then sold the information to at least two people including a loan marketer and a broker, the FSS said. The contractor and at least one other person have been arrested. The first class action lawsuit was filed against the three credit card companies late on Monday, a day after the FSS revealed the full scale of the theft, according to the law firm representing them. The victims are each claiming 110 million won ($103,400) in compensation. Lawyers said they expected more lawsuits to come, as internet chatrooms and social media seethed with complaints about the security failure. “We are preparing additional lawsuits regarding the case and are receiving applications from victims,” an official at the law firm leading the litigation said. Cho Yeon-haeng, president of Korea Finance Consumer Federation, a customer rights group, said: “Proving actual damages will be very difficult, which means at best nominal compensation for emotional injury. “What is needed is stopping repercussions by re-issuing all the affected credit cards,” he added. The stolen information included names, home addresses, and phone numbers, bank account numbers, credit card details, identification numbers, income, marriage and passport numbers. The FSS said credit card passwords were not stolen, although this was cold comfort to South Koreans for whom most credit card transactions simply require a card swipe and signature - without the need for a chip and pin process. Some outlets such as home shopping channels do not even need a signature. South Korean media reported that President Park and UN Secretary General Ban were among those whose information was stolen, although government officials and the card firms declined to comment. Park’s office declined to comment, while Ban’s office could not be reached to comment. Executives from KB Kookmin Card, Kookmin Bank, NH Nonghyup Card, Lotte Card and Korea Credit Bureau, which hired the contractor, offered to resign as investigators probed how such a massive data theft could have occurred so easily. Credit card spending amounted to 451 trillion won ($424.01 billion) in 2012, accounting for 66 percent of the country’s private consumption, according to data from the Credit Finance Association of Korea. The Nilson Report, a California trade journal that tracks the payments industry, said in its August issue that global card fraud rose to a record $11.3 billion in 2012, from just under $10 billion the year before.

370,TGT,UPDATE 1-Target cuts 475 jobs in Minnesota offices,"By Dhanya Skariachan NEW YORK, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Target Corp said on Wednesday that it is cutting 475 jobs at its headquarters and other offices in Minnesota and will not fill 700 open positions worldwide. The company, which employs 361,000 people around the globe, had a tough 2013 as U.S. shoppers remained cautious and its new Canadian stores did not do as well as it had anticipated. Target faced more pressure during the holiday season when it fell victim to a cyber attack that led to the theft of payment card numbers and personal data of tens of millions of its shoppers. “We believe these decisions, while difficult, are the right actions as we continue to focus on transforming our business,” Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said on Wednesday. She declined to provide details of the jobs being cut or the positions being left open. In early January, Target, the third largest U.S. retailer, cut its fourth-quarter profit forecast, in part due to weaker-than-expected sales since reports of the cyber-attack emerged in mid-December. Target expects full-year earnings to include charges related to the data breach, but said it could not estimate the costs. Just days after the breach became public, lawyers and retail consultants told Reuters the data theft could end up costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Target shares closed down 0.4 percent at $58.98 on the New York Stock Exchange.",1222014,http://www.reuters.com/article/target-jobcuts/update-1-target-cuts-475-jobs-in-minnesota-offices-idUSL2N0KW1M320140122

Less than 10 percent of the company’s 361,000 employees currently participate in the insurance plan that is being discontinued, Target said in a company blog post on Tuesday. “By offering them insurance, we could actually disqualify many of them from being eligible for newly available subsidies that could reduce their overall health insurance expense,” Target said.

376,TGT,Exclusive: FBI warns retailers to expect more credit card breaches,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI has warned U.S. retailers to prepare for more cyber attacks after discovering about 20 hacking cases in the past year that involved the same kind of malicious software used against Target Corp in the holiday shopping season. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation distributed a confidential, three-page report to retail companies last week describing the risks posed by “memory-parsing” malware that infects point-of-sale (POS) systems, which include cash registers and credit-card swiping machines found in store checkout aisles. “We believe POS malware crime will continue to grow over the near term, despite law enforcement and security firms’ actions to mitigate it,” said the FBI report, seen by Reuters. “The accessibility of the malware on underground forums, the affordability of the software and the huge potential profits to be made from retail POS systems in the United States make this type of financially motivated cyber crime attractive to a wide range of actors,” the FBI said. The report was dated January 17 and entitled “Recent Cyber Intrusion Events Directed Toward Retail Firms.” A spokeswoman for the FBI confirmed the agency had issued the report as part of efforts to share information about threats with the private sector. Retail, credit card and bank industry executives have become increasingly concerned about the security of payment card networks after Target, the No. 3 U.S. retailer, last month disclosed one of the biggest retail cyber attacks in history. The attack ran undetected for 19 days during the busy holiday shopping season and resulted in the theft of about 40 million credit and debit card records. The personal information of 70 million customers was also compromised. Luxury retail chain Neiman Marcus has said it too was the victim of a cyber attack, and sources have told Reuters that other retail chains have also been breached. Neiman Marcus said about 1.1 million customer cards were exposed by a data breach from July 16 to October 30 last year. In all these attacks, cyber criminals used memory-parsing software, also known as a “RAM scraper.” When a customer swipes a credit or debit card, the POS terminal grabs the transaction data from the magnetic stripe and transfers it to the retailer’s payment processing provider. While the data is encrypted during the process, RAM scrapers extract the information while it is in the computer’s live memory, where it very briefly appears in plain text. RAM scraping technology has been around for a long time, but its use has increased in recent years. Developers of the malware have also enhanced its features to make it more difficult to be detected by anti-virus software deployed on POS systems running Windows software. The FBI said in its report that one variant of the malicious POS software, known as Alina, included an option that allowed remote upgrades, making it tougher for corporate security teams to identify and eradicate it. The report said at least one type of malware has been offered for sale for as much as $6,000 in a “well-known” underground forum. “The high dollar value gained from some of these compromises can encourage intruders to develop high sophistication methodologies, as well as incorporate mechanisms for the actors to remain undetected,” the report said. Asked to comment on the FBI warning, the National Retail Federation industry trade group said retailers are alert to cyber risks. “Retailers have been and remain vigilant in their efforts to provide the highest level of security for their data systems in order to protect against malicious and criminal acts,” NRF Vice President Tom Litchford said in a statement. “As the criminal investigation continues and more information becomes available, you can be sure that the retail industry will be responsive and engaged to ensure this particular cyber-attack does not happen again.” One cyber security consultant who has reviewed the FBI report, said the findings were troubling. “Everybody we work with in the retail space is scared to death because they don’t have a lot of defenses to prepare against these types of attacks,” said the consultant, who is advising several retailers in current investigations. “This is not just based on anybody saying ‘This is going to happen.’ This is based on statistical data that the FBI is seeing,” said the consultant, who was not authorized to publicly comment on the details of the report. Retailers need to move quickly to get better tools in their networks that can analyze traffic patterns on the fly and identify any unusual activity, said another expert in retail security, who has audited POS systems to find vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit. The expert said it is more difficult for small-to-mid sized retailers to do this because they do not have as much money and expertise as major retailers. The FBI report said the bulk of the POS malware cases that the agency has investigated involve small-to-mid sized local or regional businesses, whose estimated losses each range from tens of thousands of dollars to millions of dollars. The United States Secret Service usually takes the lead in credit card breach investigations for the federal government, though the FBI sometimes opens its own cases or asked to assist. The Secret Service is leading the investigations into the breaches at Target and Neiman Marcus. A spokesman for the Secret Service declined to comment on the FBI report to retailers.

377,TGT,What Target knows about you,"(Reuters) - Among the millions of consumers who received recent emails from Target Corp apologizing that their personal data might have been accessed by cyber thieves are those who wonder exactly how they got on the list in the first place. If you didn’t give Target your email address, how did they know it? Target is renowned in the retail world for its data collection and analysis, grabbing bits and pieces wherever it can - from your store purchases to visits to its website to surveys you’ve taken to things you’ve posted on Facebook. It all goes into Target’s customer relationship management database for analysis. “A lot of consumers are just not aware to the extent to which they are collecting data,” says Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy for Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. Other retailers mine customer data by getting them to opt into loyalty or reward programs. Some retailers with established loyalty programs include CVS Caremark Corp, Sears Holdings Corp, Gap Inc, and Starbucks Corp. What sets Target apart from the crowd is an aggressive datamining of customer interactions. That includes customers’ cell phones, web cookies, purchase histories, prescription and other health information. Andew Pole, who heads a 60-person team at Target that studies customer behavior, boasted at a conference in 2010 about a proprietary program that could identify women - based on their purchases and demographic profile - who were pregnant. That’s because women often control the purchasing power of baby furniture, equipment, clothes and diapers. “This is a very profitable acquisition,” Pole told those gathered to discuss “predictive analytics”. Target goes further than that. The company can identify by name more than half the customers who walk into their stores and browse their website, according to Pole’s presentation. Each consumer’s spending and demographic information - such as age, marital status and address - is the foundation for a “guest profile” which enables the store to identify brands you are loyal to, what offers tempted you and whether you can be persuaded to shift spending from other stores to Target. “There’s a lot of Big Brother,” Pole said. Target follows the law and uses datamining to better connect with its customers, he added. Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder pointed to the company’s privacy policy for information about its data collection practices. In addition to name, address and email, Target collects driver’s license numbers, phone numbers, credit and debit card numbers, purchases, returns and exchanges, and dates of birth, according to the company’s privacy policy. Target also buys information from outside sources and gathers information customers post online that can be publicly viewed. For users of a Target debit card or credit card, information collected includes income and credit history. Target is doing nothing nefarious by collecting and analyzing all that data, says Gerald Storch, president of the New Jersey-based management consultancy Storch Advisors. “You’re trying to market to the segment of one,” says Storch, who stepped down last year as CEO of Toys R Us and prior to that was vice chairman of Target. “This is the holy grail of consumer marketing.” Mass marketing through newspaper and TV ads used to be the standard for reaching consumers, Storch says, but most “forward thinking” companies - retailers or otherwise - use purchasing patterns and other data to predict what a consumer is likely to buy and give them offers as an incentive. “If you bought a lot of carpet shampoo, they deduced you’re likely to have had a pet,” Storch says. So far, in addition to credit card and debit card information, Target has acknowledged that names, addresses and emails were compromised. Target has disclosed what it has learned to date about the data breach, Snyder notes. Details about opting out of the data collection process and the sharing of that information is included in the policy, which is posted on Target.com. (here#InfoProtect) The key to identity theft - the most worrisome of crimes for those whose data has been exposed - is the thieves obtaining Social Security numbers.

Target can’t stop you from giving out even part of your Social Security number to a con artist.

The committee is chaired by Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and author of one of the few data security bills under consideration. John Mulligan, who is executive vice president as well as chief financial officer, oversees Target’s financial portfolio, including finance and retail services, company spokeswoman Molly Snyder said in an email confirming his appearance before the panel. Representatives of the Federal Trade Commission, the Secret Service and the Department of Justice are also slated to testify at the hearing, according to the committee’s schedule.

382,TGT,Exclusive: FBI warns retailers to expect more credit card breaches,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI has warned U.S. retailers to prepare for more cyber attacks after discovering about 20 hacking cases in the past year that involved the same kind of malicious software used against Target Corp in the holiday shopping season. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation distributed a confidential, three-page report to retail companies last week describing the risks posed by “memory-parsing” malware that infects point-of-sale (POS) systems, which include cash registers and credit-card swiping machines found in store checkout aisles. “We believe POS malware crime will continue to grow over the near term, despite law enforcement and security firms’ actions to mitigate it,” said the FBI report, seen by Reuters. “The accessibility of the malware on underground forums, the affordability of the software and the huge potential profits to be made from retail POS systems in the United States make this type of financially motivated cyber crime attractive to a wide range of actors,” the FBI said. The report was dated January 17 and entitled “Recent Cyber Intrusion Events Directed Toward Retail Firms.” A spokeswoman for the FBI confirmed the agency had issued the report as part of efforts to share information about threats with the private sector. Retail, credit card and bank industry executives have become increasingly concerned about the security of payment card networks after Target, the No. 3 U.S. retailer, last month disclosed one of the biggest retail cyber attacks in history. The attack ran undetected for 19 days during the busy holiday shopping season and resulted in the theft of about 40 million credit and debit card records. The personal information of 70 million customers was also compromised. Luxury retail chain Neiman Marcus has said it too was the victim of a cyber attack, and sources have told Reuters that other retail chains have also been breached. Neiman Marcus said about 1.1 million customer cards were exposed by a data breach from July 16 to October 30 last year. In all these attacks, cyber criminals used memory-parsing software, also known as a “RAM scraper.” When a customer swipes a credit or debit card, the POS terminal grabs the transaction data from the magnetic stripe and transfers it to the retailer’s payment processing provider. While the data is encrypted during the process, RAM scrapers extract the information while it is in the computer’s live memory, where it very briefly appears in plain text. RAM scraping technology has been around for a long time, but its use has increased in recent years. Developers of the malware have also enhanced its features to make it more difficult to be detected by anti-virus software deployed on POS systems running Windows software. The FBI said in its report that one variant of the malicious POS software, known as Alina, included an option that allowed remote upgrades, making it tougher for corporate security teams to identify and eradicate it. The report said at least one type of malware has been offered for sale for as much as $6,000 in a “well-known” underground forum. “The high dollar value gained from some of these compromises can encourage intruders to develop high sophistication methodologies, as well as incorporate mechanisms for the actors to remain undetected,” the report said. Asked to comment on the FBI warning, the National Retail Federation industry trade group said retailers are alert to cyber risks. “Retailers have been and remain vigilant in their efforts to provide the highest level of security for their data systems in order to protect against malicious and criminal acts,” NRF Vice President Tom Litchford said in a statement. “As the criminal investigation continues and more information becomes available, you can be sure that the retail industry will be responsive and engaged to ensure this particular cyber-attack does not happen again.” One cyber security consultant who has reviewed the FBI report, said the findings were troubling. “Everybody we work with in the retail space is scared to death because they don’t have a lot of defenses to prepare against these types of attacks,” said the consultant, who is advising several retailers in current investigations. “This is not just based on anybody saying ‘This is going to happen.’ This is based on statistical data that the FBI is seeing,” said the consultant, who was not authorized to publicly comment on the details of the report. Retailers need to move quickly to get better tools in their networks that can analyze traffic patterns on the fly and identify any unusual activity, said another expert in retail security, who has audited POS systems to find vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit. The expert said it is more difficult for small-to-mid sized retailers to do this because they do not have as much money and expertise as major retailers. The FBI report said the bulk of the POS malware cases that the agency has investigated involve small-to-mid sized local or regional businesses, whose estimated losses each range from tens of thousands of dollars to millions of dollars. The United States Secret Service usually takes the lead in credit card breach investigations for the federal government, though the FBI sometimes opens its own cases or asked to assist. The Secret Service is leading the investigations into the breaches at Target and Neiman Marcus. A spokesman for the Secret Service declined to comment on the FBI report to retailers.

Representatives of the Federal Trade Commission, the Secret Service and the Department of Justice are also slated to testify at the Senate Judiciary hearing, according to the committee’s schedule. The Secret Service and the Department of Justice are working with Target to investigate the breach, while FTC could investigate Target if the retailer is found to have improperly protected customer data. Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy had in the past authored a data security breach bill, which he re-introduced after the news of the Target case. Target is also facing information inquiries from Democratic leaders in the Senate and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. On Thursday, Henry Waxman, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and two colleagues demanded from Target CEO Gregg Steinhafel a vast cache of documents related to the causes and impacts of the data breach, including emails, analyses and internal reports, to be provided ahead of a planned early-February hearing. David Kennedy, CEO of TrustedSec LLC, a firm that helps companies respond to cyber attacks, termed the request “onerous and unprecedented,” even though lawmakers have said they would keep the information confidential. “You just can’t basically say ‘give me everything you have related to your security program.’ This is crazy,” Kennedy said. Last week, Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller and Claire McCaskill, who chairs the Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection, both Democrats, also wrote to Steinhafel, asking for a briefing on Target’s investigation and latest findings. Rockefeller plans to introduce data security legislation, according to his staff. He had in the past authored such legislation.

389,TGT,Target to expand further in Canada with nine new stores in 2014,"TORONTO, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Target Corp will add more stores in Canada this year, the retailer said on Wednesday, even thought its 2013 entry into the country proved costlier than expected and forced it to cut its full-year profit forecast. The discount department store operator said it will open nine new stores across Canada, adding to the 124 stores it opened last year. Target, which competes with retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc, had a tough 2013. U.S. shoppers remained cautious and its Canadian expansion became costlier than expected and took longer to pay off. Target offers a mix of household goods and trendy apparel and accessories. It opened its first Canadian stores in March 2013 to much fanfare, but it has since struggled to win over shoppers who were disappointed by the selection and pricing compared to its U.S. stores. The Minneapolis-based company faced the additional challenge of a massive data breach during the holiday shopping season which resulted in weaker-than-expected sales during the period. It said an investigation found that hackers stole the personal information of at least 70 million customers, including names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses, in the second-biggest retail cyber attack on record. The company, which employs 361,000 people around the globe, also said last week it was cutting 475 jobs at its headquarters and other offices in Minnesota and will not fill 700 open positions worldwide.

390,TGT,Target representative guarded in U.S. panel briefing: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Target Corp (TGT.N) representative briefed Congressional investigators by telephone on Thursday about the retail chain’s recent massive data breach, but offered few fresh details, citing continuing law enforcement investigations. Isaac Reyes, an official with Target’s government relations department, spoke by phone to officials from the House of Representatives Oversight Committee, two sources familiar with the session told Reuters. The oversight committee, chaired by California Republican Darrell Issa, has broad jurisdiction to investigate the activities of both government agencies and private business. During the call, Reyes offered little fresh information about how the breach occurred or who Target believed was behind it. Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder told Reuters that during the briefing the company provided as much information as it could about the breach in which some 40 million credit and debit card records plus personal information of 70 million customers were stolen. “As we have briefed elected officials and their staffs over the past few weeks, we have been providing them with updates on the ongoing criminal and forensic investigation to the extent we are able to share them,” she told Reuters. In the call, Reyes said that the U.S. Justice Department had informed Target about the breach on December 12 of last year. But he declined to say if the retailer itself had learned of the problem earlier, the sources said, who declined to be identified because the briefing was closed to the public. He also told investigators the company believed it had complied with every one of the patchwork of requirements set out in state laws and regulations regarding the disclosure of such data breaches to authorities and consumers. At present there is no federal law or regulation setting nationwide rules for when consumers and law enforcement agencies must be notified of serious data breaches, though Congress has been considering related legislation for years. Four Senate Democrats, led by Commerce Committee Chairman Rockefeller and Select Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein, on Thursday introduced a bill aimed at better protecting consumers from data breaches. This is the third such bill introduced on Capitol Hill since the Target data breach. The three bills are versions of legislation which had been introduced in previous years but failed to gain traction. The sources familiar with the House committee briefing said that Reyes indicated the company was willing to turn over documents to Congressional investigators, and that it could start doing so within a few days. However, investigators expressed doubt that, given the company’s unwillingness to get into details of the breach during Thursday’s briefing, Target will turn over much revealing material. Representatives of Target have held similar phone briefings with state attorneys general, although details of these have not been made public. Several states have banded together to probe the Target data breach. The briefings come as executives of Target and Neiman Marcus NMRCUS.UL, another retailer which recently suffered a major data breach, prepare for personal appearances at Congressional hearings next week.

392,TGT,UPDATE 4-Target says criminals attacked with stolen vendor credentials,"By Jim Finkle and Mark Hosenball BOSTON/WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Target Corp  said on Wednesday that the theft of a vendor’s credentials helped cyber criminals pull off a massive theft of customer data during the holiday shopping season in late 2013. It was the first indication of how networks at the No. 3 U.S. retailer were breached, resulting in the theft of about 40 million credit and debit card records and 70 million other records with customer information such as addresses and telephone numbers. “The ongoing forensic investigation has indicated that the intruder stole a vendor’s credentials, which were used to access our system,” Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said in a statement. She declined to elaborate on what type of credentials were taken, who the vendor was, or to provide other details. The company’s shares have been hurt since the data breach was announced on Dec. 19, and the incident has drawn scrutiny from lawmakers as well as federal law enforcement and consumer protection agencies. Target closed at $56.89 per share on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, down 1.7 percent, after reaching its lowest level since July 2012. Earlier on Wednesday U.S. spy chiefs called on Congress to draft stricter requirements for how retailers and other private businesses should inform government agencies and customers about big breaches of personal and financial data. The comments came as Attorney General Eric Holder confirmed that the Department of Justice was investigating the massive hacking at Target. Separately, at Wednesday’s threat hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, where the National Security Agency is headquartered, asked intelligence chiefs if media leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden had affected U.S. cybersecurity efforts. “Is the impact of the Snowden affair slowing us down in our work to be more aggressive in the cybersecurity area?” Mikulski asked. FBI Director James Comey said political uproar over surveillance and Snowden’s leaks had complicated discussions about how to fight consumer data breaches. “There is the threat of fraud and theft because we’ve connected our lives to the Internet,” Comey said. “We need to make sure that the private sector knows the rules of the road and how we share that information with the government.” Some U.S. officials with responsibility for cybersecurity have complained privately that, while states have created a “patchwork” of local rules requiring businesses to report breaches of consumer data to authorities and the public, there are no similar federal requirements. Congress has been wrestling for years with proposals for  legislation on data security but has been unable to reach agreement. There is no national standard to govern how and when businesses that suffer consumer data breaches must advise their customers and federal agencies. Holder, testifying at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, said the Justice Department would seek the perpetrators of the Target breach as well as “any individuals and groups who exploit that data via credit card fraud.” “While we generally do not discuss specific matters under investigation, I can confirm the department is investigating the breach involving the U.S. retailer, Target,” Holder said. The Secret Service has taken the lead investigating the breaches at Target and other retailers, including Neiman Marcus  and Michaels Companies Inc, the largest U.S. arts and crafts retailer. Reuters reported on Jan. 23 that the FBI also warned U.S. retailers to prepare for more cyber attacks after discovering about 20 hacking cases over the past year that involved the same kind of malicious software used against Target during the holiday shopping season. As lawmakers accelerated to gather information about the data breaches, Senator Jay Rockefeller, Democratic chairman of the Judiciary Committee, took a new tack, asking Target why the company had not yet reported its data breach to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. “Your failure thus far to provide this information to your investors does not seem consistent with the spirit or the letter of the SEC’s financial disclosure rules,” Rockefeller wrote in the three-page letter to Target’s chief executive. Democratic members of the Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday asked Neiman Marcus for documents relating to the upscale retailer’s recent cybersecurity breach. Last week, the same lawmakers asked Target executives to provide an array of internal documents. On Thursday, members of the powerful House Oversight Committee, which has broad investigative jurisdiction, will hold a telephone briefing with Target representatives, during which detailed questions are expected to be asked about how and why the data breaches occurred. Target’s Snyder did not provide details about upcoming meetings but reiterated that Target was “continuing to work with elected officials to keep them informed and updated as our investigation continues.” At least three different congressional panels are slated to hold hearings, beginning next week. Target’s chief financial officer and a Neiman Marcus official will appear before the Senate Judiciary panel on Tuesday.",1302014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-justice-target/update-4-target-says-criminals-attacked-with-stolen-vendor-credentials-idUSL2N0L315Y20140130
393,TGT,Secret Service urges lawmakers to do more on cyber crime,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Secret Service on Monday urged U.S. lawmakers to do more to prevent the types of cyber thefts of consumer information that recently have hit Target Corp and other major retailers. “Legislative action could help to improve the nation’s cybersecurity, reduce regulatory costs on U.S. companies, and strengthen law enforcement’s ability to conduct effective investigations,” said William Noonan, a top agent with the Secret Service’s cyber operations branch. Noonan testified at a Senate Banking subcommittee hearing on safeguarding consumer financial data, the first of a series of panels scheduled this week in response to the Target breach and other incidents. Target, the No. 3 U.S. retailer, was hit by a massive cyber theft over the holiday shopping period. Some 40 million credit and debit card records were stolen, along with 70 million other records with customer information such as addresses and telephone numbers. While the Secret Service has been the lead player in the Target investigation, Noonan discussed its information-sharing efforts on cyber crime with other federal agencies as well as international law enforcement bodies such as Interpol. Noonan focused on the transnational nature of cyber crimes, including “network intrusions, hacking attacks, malicious software, and account takeovers leading to significant data breaches affecting every sector of the world economy.” “The recently reported data breaches of Target and Neiman Marcus are just the most recent, well-publicized examples of this decade-long trend,” Noonan said. Luxury department store operator Neiman Marcus in late January said that about 1.1 million customer payment cards may have been exposed during a data breach that occurred from July 16 to October 30 last year. Congress has been wrestling for years with proposals for legislation on data security, but has been unable to reach agreement. There is, for example, no national standard to govern how and when businesses that suffer consumer data breaches much advise their customers and federal agencies. On Tuesday senior officials from Target and Neiman Marcus are scheduled to testify at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about recent data breaches.

396,TGT,Target to accelerate $100 million chip-enabled smart card program: CFO,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Target Corp, which suffered a massive data breach during the holiday shopping season, is speeding up a $100 million program to implement the use of chip-enabled smart cards to protect against cyber theft, a senior company executive said. In an opinion piece on Monday in the Hill newspaper on the eve of his much-awaited appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan said the retailer’s goal was to have the technology in place by early 2015, more than six months ahead of schedule. The adoption of such chip-enabled cards would be “one step American businesses could now take that would dramatically improve the security of all credit and debit cards,” Mulligan wrote. He said the United States had been slow to develop the technology, which was already in wide use in other parts of the world. The enhanced smart cards contain tiny microprocessor chips that encrypt personal data shared with sales terminals used by merchants. Stolen smart card numbers would be useless without the chip, Mulligan said. He noted that Target, the No. 3 U.S. retailer, had been working for years to adopt the technology. “Since the breach, we are accelerating our own $100 million investment to put chip-enabled technology in place. Our goal: implement this technology in our stores and on our proprietary REDcards by early 2015, more than six months ahead of our previous plan.” Mulligan said requiring the use of four-digit personal identification numbers to complete sales transactions would provide additional safety. “To be frank, there is no consensus across the business community on the use of PINs in conjunction with chip-enabled cards,” Mulligan wrote. “But Target supports the goal and will work toward adoption of the practice in our own stores and more widely.” In the cyber theft that hit Target, some 40 million credit and debit card records were stolen, along with 70 million other records with customer information such as addresses and telephone numbers. Luxury retailer Neiman Marcus has also disclosed a data breach that compromised data from about 1.1 million cards. Michaels Stores Inc, the biggest U.S. arts and crafts retailer, said it was investigating a possible security breach on its payment card network “The data breach that struck our company spotlighted the sophistication of criminal hacker networks operating across the globe,” Mulligan wrote. “We know the attack created significant concerns for millions of customers. We will learn from this incident and we will work to make Target, and the wider business community, more secure in the future.” ",2042014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-target-mulligan/target-to-accelerate-100-million-chip-enabled-smart-card-program-cfo-idUSBREA1302L20140204

398,TGT,U.S. Secret Service visits refrigeration company in Target probe,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Secret Service visited the office of a Pennsylvania-based refrigeration contractor, Fazio Mechanical Services, in connection with an investigation of the Target Corp consumer data breach, a spokesman for the agency said on Wednesday. Fazio is the largest refrigeration contractor in the Western Pennsylvania region, and Target is one of its clients, according to the Sharpsburg-based company’s website. A law enforcement source told Reuters that evidence suggests the hackers stole login credentials from Fazio and may have used the credentials to break into Target’s network. The source added, however, that investigators were not sure that this was what happened, and it was possible the hackers used other ways to breach Target’s network. Representatives for Fazio could not be reached for comment. Security blogger Brian Krebs reported earlier on Wednesday that Fazio President Ross Fazio had confirmed the visit by the Secret Service in connection with the Target probe. Last week, Target, the third-largest U.S. retailer, said the theft of a vendor’s credentials helped cyber criminals pull off a massive data breach during the holiday shopping season in late 2013. Target did not identify the vendor. “Because this continues to be an active and ongoing investigation we don’t have additional details to share at this time,” Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said in an email on Wednesday. Target previously said that hackers stole about 40 million credit and debit card records, as well as personal information - such as addresses and phone numbers - of about 70 million customers.

400,TGT,RPT-U.S. retailers face pressure to raise cybersecurity spending,"By Dhanya Skariachan and Phil Wahba NEW YORK, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Target Corp’s decision to speed up a $100 million program to adopt the use of chip-enabled smart cards is just a drop in the bucket when it comes to what retailers need to do to defend themselves against future cyber attacks, according to security experts and IT service providers. The pressure to boost security spending comes at a time when merchants are already spending millions to fend off online retailer Amazon.com and facing an October 2015 deadline set by payment networks Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc  to accept new payment cards that store information on computer chips rather than on traditional magnetic stripes. Target, the No. 3 U.S. retailer, said this week it hoped to finish upgrading its payment card network to the more secure “chip and PIN” standard by early 2015, some six months ahead of its previous plan. The system, already widely used in Europe and Asia, can accommodate cards carrying tiny microprocessors, which makes it harder for cyber crooks to use stolen data. U.S. retailers have been so focused on cutting costs and expanding their online presence in the past decade that they have not spent enough of their technology budgets on protecting customer data, security experts and IT service providers said. While retail spending on overall technology was expected to rise 4 percent annually between 2012 and 2017, U.S. stores spend only roughly 2 percent of their tech budgets on security, with the bulk going to improving their e-commerce, technology advisory firm IDC Retail Insights said. Unlike their peers in other industries, most retailers still focus on just meeting the basic standards set by the payment card industry rather than substantially beefing up safeguards against increasingly sophisticated attacks, security experts said. “Retailers have to assume that they are constantly being targeted and actually constantly being penetrated,” said Eddie Schwartz, a vice president at Verizon Enterprise Solutions, who urged retailers to take a more proactive approach. Pressure from Congress, consumer groups and the banking industry following recent theft of customer data at Target, Neiman Marcus and others may be the turning point to get the retail industry to spend more on security, experts said. For example, Dinesh Bajaj, the vice president of retail and logistics practice in Americas for Infosys Ltd, expects retailers to spend more in coming months on encrypting credit card data while storing it in multiple systems. IDC Retail Insights expects spending by retailers in 2014 specifically for security in the United States to be $720.3 million, an increase of 5.7 percent from last year in part because of the recent breaches. Total tech spending by retailers this year is expected to hit $36.34 billion. “It’s clear that companies need to do a lot more, that they continue to make basic mistakes,” Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said at a hearing on Tuesday looking into massive data breaches at Target and Neiman that affected millions of shoppers. Retailers spend 4 percent of their technology budgets on security, compared with 5.5 percent for banks and 5.6 percent for healthcare companies, according to technology research firm Gartner. Security experts urged retailers to set up a non-competitive “collaboration space” where they can virtually meet to share best practices and real-time alerts about data breaches as their peers in telecoms, financial services, utilities, transportation and energy have done. There are currently more than a dozen non-profit groups known as Information Sharing and Analysis Centers, or ISACs, that share real-time information about cyber threats and other emerging security risks. “Having the tools and technology isn’t enough in this day and age,” Michael Kingston, Neiman’s chief information officer, acknowledged while testifying before Congress on Tuesday. “It’s often how you deploy this technologies and what else are you doing, which goes back to make sure we’re sharing intelligence as much as we can.” Retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Home Depot Inc, Toys R Us, Sears Holding Corp, Walgreen Co , CVS Caremark Corp, Best Buy Co Inc, Macy’s Inc and Neiman declined to share details of their spending on data security. Target said it has invested “hundreds of millions of dollars” in cybersecurity but did not give the exact amount. “Retail has small margins and wants to keep prices low, and so they have been slow to improve their systems,” said retail industry IT consultant Cathy Hotka. But the imperative to do so is even greater given how much bolder and skilled hackers have become, she added. Tom Litchford, vice president of retail technologies at the trade group National Retail Federation said merchants have made “significant” investments to classify and encrypt data and to train software developers and other staff. But data show that retailers have traditionally spent proportionately less on security than other leading industries. “They don’t spend enough on isolating their payment card processing environment from the rest of their store networks and the public Internet,” said Gartner analyst Avivah Litan. “This leaves their cardholder data environment open to security holes that the criminals punch through.”",2052014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-retailers-cybersecurity/rpt-u-s-retailers-face-pressure-to-raise-cybersecurity-spending-idUSL2N0LA02X20140205

405,TGT,"UPDATE 2-Facebook, GM attract hedge fund buyers; Netflix scaled back","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss Feb 14 (Reuters) - Top U.S. hedge fund managers in the fourth quarter focused on the consumer sector, with investment plays ranging from high-end auction house Sotheby’s to large retailers Target Corp and Walgreen Co General Motors also became the flavor of the quarter with many hedge funds as the U.S. government exited its position. This year, however, the stock price has fallen nearly 14 percent, making for a rough start for new Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra. But on Friday, the automaker’s stock rose 75 cents, or 2.13 percent, to $35.95. The quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are always intriguing for investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying. But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter. Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side. The filings don’t disclose short positions, bets that a stock will fall in price. And there’s also little disclosure on bonds and other securities that do not trade on exchanges. Upon request, the SEC also permits managers to omit sensitive stock positions from 13F filings. As a result, the public filings don’t always present a complete picture of a manager’s stock holdings.  Here are some of the hot stocks and sectors in which hedge fund managers either took new positions or exited from in the fourth quarter. Activist investor Marcato Capital Management, run by Mick McGuire, boosted the firm’s holdings of Sotheby’s by 35 percent, having bought an additional 1,200,000 shares in the auction house to now own 4,562,991. Eric Mindich’s Eton Park Capital Management also is a huge fan, buying an additional 265,000 shares, bringing his stake to 2.2 million shares. Tiger Consumer Management got back into Facebook Inc after exiting it in the third quarter. The filing shows the fund owned 1,384,507 shares of the social media powerhouse at the end of the fourth quarter. Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global Investors bought an additional 13.9 million class A shares, bringing its stake to 18.3 million class A shares. Scout Capital Management closed out of its position, selling 3 million shares. Scout Capital may be going on a junk food diet, as it liquidated its entire position in Whole Foods  and Starbucks but added 3.9 million shares in Yum! Brands Inc. The fund’s owners said last month that they are splitting up and shutting down the $6.7 billion fund after 13 years. Returns were strong at 21 percent last year. Kyle Bass’s Hayman Capital announced in early December that he established a position and that the 4,606,005 million shares he owned made up nearly one quarter of his portfolio. Bridger Capital trimmed its holdings in General Motors Co by selling 155,000 shares, but the fund still owns 1,695,000 shares, which ranks the stock as the fund’s fourth largest position. Bronson Point Management, founded by former managers at SAC and Pequot, added to its holding of GM by buying another 400,000 shares, increasing its stake by 34 percent. And Cooperman’s Omega added a new position, buying 1.04 million shares of the automaker. Meanwhile, Bass of Hayman Capital liquidated his position, selling 436,371 shares. Tiger Consumer Management sold 368,252, cutting its stake by 47 percent. Blue Ridge sold all of its Netflix exposure, liquidating 349,000 shares of the American provider of on-demand Internet streaming media, while Carl Icahn cut his stake by 2.9 million shares, bringing his exposure to 2.7 million shares. Chase Coleman and Feroz Dewan’s Tiger Global Management bought an additional 223,000 shares, bringing their stake to 663,000 shares. Carlson Capital took a new position in Target, buying 1.4 million shares only weeks before the retailer made headlines after becoming the victim of computer hackers who stole millions of credit card records. Viking Global Investors opened a new stake of 11.6 million shares. Jana Partners increased its stake in Walgreen to 7.3 million sole shares versus 1.3 million sole shares. For more on activist investors Jana Partners, please see. Fresh from bankruptcy and a merger with US Airways, the “new” American has become a new favorite with money managers and the stock has climbed 38.71 percent this year alone. Hutchin Hill opened a new position in the airline with 875,000 shares. Farallon Capital Management added to its holding of Time Warner Cable Inc in the fourth quarter by buying 1,905,500 shares. It owned 2,432,00 shares at the end of the quarter, making it the firm’s biggest position. On Thursday, a proposed all-stock deal in which Comcast Corp would take over Time Warner Cable for $45.2 billion was announced. Viking Global Investors opened a new stake of 15.1 million shares. Aaron Cowen’s Suvretta Capital opened a new position, buying 322,000 shares to make it his fund’s third biggest positions, while Omega Advisors added 209,630 shares.

406,TGT,"eBay, Facebook and General Motors attract hedge fund buyers","(Reuters) - Top U.S. hedge fund managers in the fourth quarter focused on the consumer sector, with investment plays ranging from high-end auction house Sotheby’s to eBay Inc, the multinational Internet consumer-to-consumer corporation. General Motors also became the flavor of the quarter with many hedge funds as the U.S. government exited its position. This year, however, the stock price has fallen nearly 14 percent, making for a rough start for new CEO Mary Barra. But on Friday, the automaker’s stock rose 62 cent, or 1.76 percent, to $35.82. The quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, in so-called 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are always intriguing for investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying. But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter. Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side. The filings don’t disclose short positions, bets that a stock will fall in price. And there’s also little disclosure on bonds and other securities that do not trade on exchanges. Upon request, the SEC also permits managers to omit sensitive stock positions from 13F filings. As a result, the public filings don’t always present a complete picture of a manager’s stock holdings. Here are some of the hot stocks and sectors in which hedge fund managers either took new positions or exited from in the fourth quarter.

408,TGT,Data breach costs seen crimping Target's firepower for buybacks,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several analysts expect Target Corp (TGT.N) to slash its share buybacks as the third-largest U.S. retailer copes with costs tied to the massive data breach that affected millions of customers. Target had originally planned to buy back up to $4 billion of shares this year, but analysts do not expect it to achieve that goal as it sets aside money to deal with the data breach and try not to borrow more so it can maintain its credit rating. When Target reports quarterly results on Wednesday it will mark the first time that it faces Wall Street since the breach, which led to the theft of about 40 million credit and debit card records and 70 million other records with information such as addresses and phone numbers of shoppers compromised. The security breach “could crimp their repurchase activity,” said Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joe Feldman. “That’s definitely a concern of a lot of investors.” Target spokesman Eric Hausman said the company remains committed to share repurchases over time and “will govern the pace of repurchases with the goal of maintaining our strong A credit rating,” but did not comment further ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings release. Any move to curb repurchases could make the retailer’s stock less attractive to investors over the near term. Fitch Ratings analyst Philip Zahn said he did not expect Target to be aggressive with share repurchases as the company would have to take on additional debt to do so and that could end up costing Target its current credit rating. The retailer already has lowered expectations for the fourth quarter, in part due to weaker-than-expected sales since reports of the cyber-attack emerged in mid-December. News of the breach has hurt its reputation and stock. Target has yet to tell investors how much it has spent on dealing with the fallout from the breach. Some analysts estimate the breach will cost Target $500 million to $1.1 billion. Target will likely incur costs tied to reissuing cards, bank settlements, credit monitoring, and enhancing security systems, but will not have to replace all cards or make large-spread hardware replacements, Wells Fargo’s Matt Nemer noted. Feldman, like some other analysts, urged investors to abandon Target and invest in Dollar General (DG.N) and Dollar Tree (DLTR.O) instead, citing better growth prospects and the assessment that the cloud of uncertainty around Target is not going away soon. Analysts have cut Target profit estimates for the fiscal years ending January 2014 and January 2015 by about 12.2 percent and 9.5 percent, respectively, since December 18 - the day before the company confirmed the breach, Thomson Reuters Starmine data showed. Nemer, who has an “outperform” rating on Target, said the retailer’s goal of $4 billion in repurchases in 2014 “seems out of reach” but he still believes the company has the capacity to fund about $2 billion in buybacks if breach-related costs are in the hundreds of millions and not higher. Last year, the company had set a goal of repurchasing up to $4 billion of its shares annually in 2014 and beyond. Target, whose consumer perception scores had dropped to their lowest level since 2007 after the breach, is also likely to face tough questions on how it plans to win back shoppers. The “focus will likely be on Target’s 2014 strategy to earn back guest trust and share of wallet,” said Cowen analyst Faye Landes, who recently downgraded Target’s stock. Some want to know if the breach had a lingering effect on sales and if the related costs will affect Target’s plans for Canada and to test shipping directly from stores. “They have a lot of stuff to work on,” said Stifel Nicolaus’ David Schick, who picked Costco shares (COST.O) over Target. “Can they get Canada to turn? Can they become as powerful in ecommerce and omnichannel as they were in retail five or ten years ago? Can they re-emerge as a merchandising powerhouse?” Schick said, while detailing Target’s strategic issues.

409,TGT,Attorney General seeks national standard to protect against identity theft,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Attorney General Eric Holder, citing the recent massive data theft at retailer Target Corp, urged Congress on Monday to enact a national standard for notifying consumers about such breaches. “This would empower the American people to protect themselves if they are at risk of identity theft,” Holder said in a statement urging congressional action. “It would enable law enforcement to better investigate these crimes - and hold compromised entities accountable when they fail to keep sensitive information safe.” Data thefts at Target and luxury retailer Neiman Marcus Group LLC have rekindled enthusiasm in Congress for a single federal law on how customers should be notified about such breaches. But those efforts face the same roadblock as in the past: dozens of overlapping state laws are already in place. Federal laws regulate how specific industries, such as banks and hospitals, handle compromised data security, but other kinds of companies, including retailers, face no such uniform standard. Instead, 46 states and the District of Columbia have passed their own laws that tell companies when and how consumers have to be alerted to data breaches and what qualifies as a breach. Negotiations over fitting state standards under an umbrella federal law therefore face a tug of war among companies, consumer advocates and state authorities. The National Retail Federation in a January letter to Congress restated its decade-old position in favor of a nationwide standard that would pre-empt state rules. But some state attorneys general worry that federal standards would dilute their power to pursue violators. Saying that data breaches “are becoming all too common,” Holder said Justice Department officials were working closely with the FBI and prosecutors to combat cyber criminals. “It’s time for leaders in Washington to provide the tools we need to do even more,” he added, urging Congress “to create a strong, national standard for quickly alerting consumers whose information may be compromised.” ",2242014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cybersecurity/attorney-general-seeks-national-standard-to-protect-against-identity-theft-idUSBREA1N0N520140224

411,TGT,House oversight panel seeks documents on Target breach,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A House of Representatives committee with broad investigative jurisdiction has turned up the heat on Target Corp, demanding that the No. 3 U.S. retailer turn over internal documents and messages describing how and when it learned of a recent massive consumer data breach. In a letter made available on Tuesday to Reuters, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform requested that Target turn over all documents or communications generated between November 1 and December 13, in which Target employees or “agents” discuss “any suspicion” that a data breach had occurred. The committee set a deadline of March 10 for Target to turn over the materials. If the company does not comply, the committee’s majority Republicans have the power to issue a subpoena forcing the company’s compliance. The news came a day before the company is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings and its leaders face Wall Street analysts for the first time since the breach. Several analysts expect Target to slash its share buybacks as it copes with costs tied to the breach, which some estimate will cost the company $500 million to $1.1 billion. The 19-day breach of Target’s computer networks over the holiday shopping period resulted in the theft of an estimated 40 million credit and debit card records and 70 million other records with customer information, such as addresses and telephone numbers. In the letter dated Monday, the House committee also requested any documents generated between November 1 and December 19 referring to discussions about notifying others about the data breach, and any documents generated since December 12 in which any federal agency advised the company to avoid providing information to Congress. Congressional sources said that this is the first time the majority on the Republican-led committee had sent such a request to Target. The sources said the letter was prompted, at least in part, after committee officials felt dissatisfied with responses given by Isaac Reyes, an official with Target’s government relations department, during a January 30 conference call about the data breach. The letter was signed by Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, a California Republican who has garnered headlines for his fierce criticism of the Obama administration’s performance on a wide range of issues. The committee has wide jurisdiction to investigate government and private business activity. In its letter, the panel hints that the retailer may not have been entirely forthcoming in its statements to the public and Congress about when it learned of the data breach. Investigators believe that the hackers managed to break into Target’s payment network by first breaching a “data connection” between the U.S. retailer and a heating and ventilating systems contractor based near Pittsburgh. The committee’s letter noted that in testimony before a Senate Judiciary Committee on February 4, John Mulligan, Target’s chief financial officer, testified that the company had no knowledge that malware related to the data breach had been installed in its systems before receiving a notification from the U.S. Justice Department on December 12. The House oversight committee said that statement did not “clarify” when Target learned that it could have been the victim of a breach, since cybersecurity blog KrebsonSecurity reported that Target may have been warned earlier about a problem. In January, minority Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce committee also sent a letter to Target requesting documents. Congressional aides have said that Target responded to an earlier request for data issued by Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee but that response, which has not been made public, did not provide new insight. Asked why the Republican majority leaders on that committee did not push for the documents, Representative Lee Terry of Nebraska on February 5 said Target had been forthcoming during conversations with his staff and such pressure was unwarranted “until they don’t show that they are willing to give us data.” A Target spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. Target shares, which have fallen about 15 percent since the data breaches were made public in December, were up 0.6 percent in afternoon trading at $56.51.

413,TGT,US STOCKS-S&P; 500 ends near flat; retailers fly for a second day,"* S&P; 500 hits resistance at 2013 year-end mark * Target and Lowe’s rally after results * J.C. Penney shares jump after the bell * January new home sales surge past forecasts * Dow up 0.1 pct; S&P; 500 flat; Nasdaq up 0.1 pct By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Feb 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks finished flat on Wednesday with investors hesitant to make a big move on the day before comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, though retailers’ shares rallied on results for a second day. Target Corp and Lowe’s Cos Inc shares jumped following upbeat earnings and gave the biggest boosts to the S&P; 500. An S&P; 500 retail index gained more than 1 percent for a second day. After the bell, shares of J.C. Penney Co Inc climbed 12.8 percent to $6.72 as the U.S. department store chain forecast more improvement in its comparable sales and gross profit margin this fiscal year. The S&P; 500 once again briefly broke above its 2013 year-end closing level of 1,848.36, which has served as resistance, but failed to hold above it, analysts said. The index remained down 0.2 percent for the year. “From a technical perspective, we’re battling with the year-to-date break-even mark on the S&P;,” said Todd Salamone, vice president of research at Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio. “It just seems ... there’s no firm commitment to drive the S&P; back above this particular level.” But he said the market also seems to be biding time until Thursday, when Yellen addresses the Senate Banking Committee in semiannual testimony about monetary policy. This appearance, originally set for Feb. 13, had to be postponed when Washington was walloped with the heaviest snowfall of the season. Her comments will be scrutinized for insight into how much an unexpectedly cold winter has affected economic activity, and for confirmation that the Fed will maintain its stimulus-trimming schedule. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.75 points or 0.12 percent, to end at 16,198.41. The S&P; 500 inched up a mere 0.04 of a point to finish at 1,845.16. The Nasdaq Composite added 4.477 points or 0.10 percent, to close at 4,292.064. The S&P; 500 reached a record intraday high of 1,858.71 on Monday, but was unable to hit a record close. The small-cap Russell 2000 index ., however, climbed to a record closing high of 1,181.72 on Wednesday. Adding to investor anxiety were developments in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin put 150,000 combat troops on high alert for war games near Ukraine. In the retail sector, Target’s stock jumped 7 percent to close at $60.49 after the company reported results. The third-largest U.S. retailer said sales and earnings had been affected by a massive data breach and that costs relating to the event could hurt future profits. Lowe’s stock rose 5.4 percent to end at $50.72 after the No. 2 U.S. home improvement retailer reported earnings and sales growth and unveiled an additional stock-buyback program of $5 billion. The S&P; 500 retail index gained 1.4 percent. Wednesday’s strong retail performance came a day after upbeat results from Macy’s and Home Depot. Home Depot shares on Wednesday closed up 0.9 percent at $81.71 after rising to $82.71, a lifetime high. Macy’s stock jumped 3 percent to close at $57.96, off a 52-week high at $58.65. On the economic front, new home sales surged to a 5-1/2-year high in January, far exceeding expectations. While much recent data has been below forecasts, analysts have attributed that to bad weather rather than worsening fundamentals. The housing data could support that interpretation. The day’s decliners included First Solar Inc, whose shares fell a day after the U.S. solar panel maker reported that its fourth-quarter net income fell 58 percent.

Target Corp and Lowe’s Cos Inc shares jumped following upbeat earnings and gave the biggest boosts to the S&P; 500. An S&P; 500 retail index gained more than 1 percent for a second day. After the bell, shares of J.C. Penney Co Inc climbed 12.8 percent to $6.72 as the U.S. department store chain forecast more improvement in its comparable sales and gross profit margin this fiscal year. The S&P; 500 once again briefly broke above its 2013 year-end closing level of 1,848.36, which has served as resistance, but failed to hold above it, analysts said.

This appearance, originally set for Feb. 13, had to be postponed when Washington was walloped with the heaviest snowfall of the season.

The Nasdaq Composite added 4.477 points or 0.10 percent, to close at 4,292.064. The S&P; 500 reached a record intraday high of 1,858.71 on Monday, but was unable to hit a record close. The small-cap Russell 2000 index ., however, climbed to a record closing high of 1,181.72 on Wednesday. Adding to investor anxiety were developments in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin put 150,000 combat troops on high alert for war games near Ukraine. In the retail sector, Target’s stock jumped 7 percent to close at $60.49 after the company reported results. The third-largest U.S. retailer said sales and earnings had been affected by a massive data breach and that costs relating to the event could hurt future profits.

417,TGT,Target shares recover after reassurance on data breach impact,"NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Target Corp shares made strong gains after it reassured investors that customers were beginning to return to its U.S. stores, suggesting that the impact of a massive data breach may not be as severe as some had feared. The third-largest U.S. retailer said on Wednesday that customer traffic had started to improve this year after falling significantly at the end of the holidays when news of the cyber attack and theft of payment card data spooked shoppers. Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan said on a conference call he expected first-quarter sales at its established U.S. stores to be flat to down 2 percent and so far in February, they have been running within that range and nearly flat to last year. Target shares, which had fallen 11 percent since news of the breach broke before Wednesday, were up 6.8 percent at $60.37, their highest level for almost six weeks. It was the first time the Minneapolis-based chain had faced Wall Street since the breach, which led to the theft of about 40 million credit and debit card records and 70 million other records with information such as addresses and phone numbers of shoppers compromised. Earlier on Wednesday, Target warned that costs tied to the cyber attack could hurt its results in the first quarter and beyond. Still, its shares rose as its full-year outlook was better than some investors had expected. Mulligan said on the call that the outlook did not include potential additional costs related to the data breach. The retailer now sees 2014 buyback capacity at $1 billion to $2 billion as it sets aside money to cope with the breach and tries to stay away from borrowing more to preserve its credit rating. It had originally planned to buy back up to $4 billion of shares this year. Target reported a 46 percent drop in net profit in the crucial holiday quarter and reported $61 million in costs related to the breach, much of which was covered by insurance. It did not provide an estimate on future expenses related to the cyber attack, though it said they “may have a material adverse effect” on results of operations through the end of the current year and beyond. “It is going to take some time for this to heal,” said Sean Naughton of Piper Jaffray, who estimates that transactions were down “in the high single digits” in the weeks after the breach was disclosed. Target said it sees first-quarter profit of 60 cents to 75 cents, excluding expenses related to the data breach and other items. Analysts expect the company to report quarterly profit of 85 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For the full year, Target sees earnings of $3.85 to $4.15 a share on that basis, compared with the analyst forecast of $4.15 per share. Naughton said that Target’s reputation for having a top-rate shopping experience had been tarnished by the fact that many customers have either had to have payment cards replaced or find themselves checking their monthly statements more closely, giving them a negative association with the retailer. He noted that Target posted a 5.5 percent drop in transaction count during the quarter, the worst he had ever seen, even steeper than the 4.8 percent drop reported when the United States was in the midst of a financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008. Sales fell 3.8 percent to $21.52 billion in the fourth quarter, missing the already lowered estimate of $22.37 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year, fell 2.5 percent. The data breach “took the wind out of Target’s sails - and unfortunately sales,” said Sandy Skrovan, U.S. Research Director at Planet Retail. Net earnings fell to $520 million, or 81 cents a share in the three months that ended on Feb 1, from $961 million, or $1.47 a share, a year earlier. Excluding its losses in Canada and a host of items, it earned $1.30 a share. That was at the high end of its lowered forecast from January. The retailer had already lowered expectations for the fourth quarter. News of the breach has hurt its reputation and stock, and made many on Wall Street take down their profit and sales estimates on Target. Target said of the $61 million in expenses related to the breach during the quarter, $44 million were offset by an insurance payment, bringing the impact to $17 million. Mark Rasch, a former cyber crimes prosecutor who worked on some of the biggest U.S. payment card breach cases, said that it was too early to estimate how big the bill would be, but it would certainly be in the hundreds of millions of dollars and could top $1 billion. “We know it is going to be big. We just don’t know how big,” he said. Target has declined to discuss exactly what sorts of costs its cyber insurance will cover or identify its insurers. Insurers offer cyber policies that cover costs for items such as investigating breaches and repairing networks, compensating credit card issuers for fraudulent activity, fighting lawsuits and responding to regulatory probes. Target said breach-related expenses may include costs for reissuing cards, lawsuits, government probes and enforcement proceedings, legal expenses, investigative and consulting fees, and capital investments.

Stocks opened higher but pared gains almost immediately despite some positive housing data and strong results from retailers Target Corp and Lowe’s Cos Inc. The S&P;’s record has been serving as a resistance level, with traders finding few reasons to push indexes out of their recent trading range. The index is less than 1 percent below its all-time high. In a positive sign, new home sales surged to a 5-1/2-year high in January, far outpacing expectations. While much recent data has been below forecasts, analysts have pinned that to bad weather rather than worsening fundamentals. The housing data could support that theory. “The vast majority of recent weakness has been related to weather, with the Northeast paralyzed and stores horrible as a result, while we continue to see strength in areas that weren’t impacted,” said Eric Green, senior portfolio manager and director of research at Penn Capital Management in Philadelphia. “I don’t think the economy’s strength differs too much from state to state, so confidence should continue to come back to the market.” Target rose 5 percent to $59.36 after reporting its results, even as the retailer said the sales and earnings had been impacted by a massive data breach and that costs relating to the event could hurt future profits. Lowe’s rose 5.3 percent to $50.69 after the home improvement retailer reported earnings and sales growth and an additional stock buyback program of $5 billion. The results come a day after peer Home Depot also posted strong earnings. The S&P; retail index rose 1.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 27.93 points, or 0.17 percent, at 16,207.59. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was up 2.08 points, or 0.11 percent, at 1,847.20. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 11.94 points, or 0.28 percent, at 4,299.53.

426,TGT,"UPDATE 1-Swatch sues Target, claims it copied watch designs","By Jonathan Stempel March 10 (Reuters) - Target Corp has been sued by Swatch Group SA, which accused the second-largest U.S. discount retailer of illegally selling watches that copy its own. In a lawsuit made public on Monday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Swatch, which is known for its plastic namesake watches, accused Target of infringing its designs for “zebra” and “multi-color” watches. Swatch said the quality of Target’s watches is “inferior” to its own, and that their continued sale is likely to confuse shoppers and damage the Swiss company’s sales. It also said it advised Target of the alleged infringement, but that the Minneapolis-based company continued its sales. “By adopting the Zebra Watch trade dress and the Multi-Color Watch trade dress, defendants are unfairly competing” with Swatch, the complaint said. Swatch seeks to stop Target from selling the alleged copies, recoup profit from prior sales and be awarded money damages. Target spokesman Evan Lapiska declined to discuss the lawsuit, but said the retailer’s policy is “to respect the intellectual property rights of others and we expect the same from our vendors and partners.” Swatch’s lawsuit is dated March 7.

428,TGT,Target says it declined to act on early alert of cyber breach,"BOSTON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Target Corp’s security software detected potentially malicious activity during last year’s massive data breach, but its staff decided not to take immediate action, the No. 3. U.S. retailer said on Thursday. “With the benefit of hindsight, we are investigating whether if different judgments had been made the outcome may have been different,” company spokeswoman Molly Snyder said in a statement. The disclosure came after Bloomberg Businessweek reported on Thursday that Target’s security team in Bangalore had received alerts from a FireEye Inc security system on November 30 after the attack was launched and sent them to Target headquarters in Minneapolis. The FireEye reports indicated malicious software had appeared in the system, according to a person whom Bloomberg Businessweek had consulted on Target’s investigation but was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The alert from FireEye labeled the threat with the generic name “malware.binary,” according to Bloomberg Businessweek. Two security experts who advise organizations in responding to cyber attacks and both have experience using FireEye technology said that security personnel typically don’t get excited about such generic alerts because FireEye does not provide much information about those threats. The experts said that they believed it was likely that Target’s security team received hundreds of such alerts on a daily basis, which would have made it tough to have singled out that threat as being particularly malicious. “They are bombarded with alerts. They get so many that they just don’t respond to everything,” said Shane Shook, an executive with Cylance Inc. “It is completely understandable how this happened.” John Strand, owner of Black Hills Information Security, said that it was easy to paint Target as being incompetent, given the severity of the breach, but that it was not fair to do so. “Target is a huge organization. They probably get hundreds of these alerts a day,” he said. “We can always look for someone to blame. Sometimes it just doesn’t work that way.” Target Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan told a congressional committee in February that the company only began investigating after on December 12, when the U.S. Justice Department warned the company about suspicious activity involving payment cards. Within three days, nearly all the malicious software had been removed from Target’s cash registers, he said. FOLLOW-UP DIDN’T SEEM WARRANTED “Through our investigation, we learned that after these criminals entered our network, a small amount of their activity was logged and surfaced to our team. That activity was evaluated and acted upon,” Snyder said. “Based on their interpretation and evaluation of that activity, the team determined that it did not warrant immediate follow up.” Target shares fell 2 percent to $59.86 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange after the company released the statement. Some 40 million payment card records were stolen from the retailer, along with 70 million other records with customer information such as addresses and telephone numbers. Congress is investigating the breach along with lapses at other retailers, and credit card companies were pushing for better security. Target also faces dozens of potential class-action lawsuits and action from banks that could seek reimbursement for millions of dollars in losses due to fraud and the cost of card replacements.

Shook and Strand said that the vast majority of FireEye’s customers turn off that functionality because it is known for incorrectly flagging data as malware, which can halt email and Web traffic for business users. “FireEye ... is cutting edge,” Strand said. “But it takes love and care and feeding.

430,TGT,Target missed early alert of credit card data breach -report,"WASHINGTON, March 13 (Reuters) - A Target Corp team of security experts, armed with a malware detection tool made by FireEye Inc, alerted company officials about a possible data breach on Nov. 30, but they failed to respond to the warning signs, according to a media report on Thursday. The security specialists in Bangalore, India, monitoring  computer logs found FireEye’s alerts from Nov. 30 and notified Target officials in Minneapolis, Bloomberg Businessweek reported. They also found more alerts from Dec. 2, when more malware surfaced. Such warnings, if heeded, could have cut short the massive data breach that affected millions of customers who shopped at the nation’s No. 3 retailer between Nov. 27 and Dec. 18 - the height of the U.S. holiday shopping season. Some 40 million credit and debit card records were stolen from the retailer, along with 70 million other records with customer information such as addresses and telephone numbers. Congress is investigating the breach along with lapses that surfaced at other retailers, and credit card companies are pushing for better security. Shares of Target took a hit after news of the security lapse surfaces in mid-December but recovered after the company offered assurances last month. Its shares were largely unchanged in pre-market trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. Shares of FireEye were up 2 percent on Nasdaq. Bloomberg, citing a source who has consulted on the Target’s investigation, said hackers deployed a custom-made code on Nov. 30 that triggered a FireEye alert for the malware, including details on the servers where stolen data was to be delivered. The security system’s automatic function to delete such malware was turned off by Target’s security team, the report said, citing two people who audited FireEye’s role after the breach. Target Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel, in a statement to Bloomberg, said the retailer was still reviewing its “people, processes and technology” in the wake of the breach. “As the investigation is not complete, we don’t believe it’s constructive to engage in speculation without the benefit of the final analysis,” Steinhafel wrote, according to the report. He said the company had “already taken significant steps.” Target earlier this month said it was overhauling its information security practices. Representatives for Target and FireEye could not immediately be reached to comment on the report.",3132014,http://www.reuters.com/article/target-breach/target-missed-early-alert-of-credit-card-data-breach-report-idUSL2N0MA0KF20140313
431,TGT,UPDATE 1-Target warns data breach could be worse than reported so far,"By Jim Finkle and Phil Wahba BOSTON/NEW YORK, March 14 (Reuters) - Target Corp  warned that last year’s massive security breach could have been more extensive than reported so far, leading to further losses at the No. 3 U.S. retailer. “Our investigation of the matter is ongoing and it is possible that we will identify additional information that was accessed or stolen, which could materially worsen the losses and reputational damage we have experienced,” the company said in its 10-K annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday. The company has so far said that some 40 million payment card records were stolen along with 70 million other customer records during a massive cyber attack over the holiday shopping season. For example, the SEC filing noted that when the company initially identified the intrusion in mid-December investigators believed the information stolen was limited to some 40 million payment card records. They later discovered that another 70 million pieces of customer data had been taken. The Minneapolis-based retailer has previously warned that news of the breach has damaged its reputation, causing some customers to stay away and hurting sales. Target executives are unsure how long it might take to restore the company’s reputation, the filing said. “We cannot predict the length or extent of any ongoing impact to sales.” When the company reported quarterly results on Feb. 26, it said customer traffic had started to improve this year after falling significantly on news of the cyber attack, which surfaced in mid-December. Congress is investigating the breach along with potential lapses at other retailers, and credit card companies are pushing for better security.

432,TGT,UPDATE 2-California DMV probing possible breach of credit card system,"(Adds details about Target breach) LOS ANGELES, March 22 (Reuters) - The California Department of Motor Vehicles is investigating a possible security breach of its credit card processing services, but its internal computer system does not appear to have been accessed, a spokesman said on Saturday. The disclosure by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in the nation’s most populous state comes at a time of heightened concern about data breaches following revelations of a massive theft of payment card records from Target Corp. “The Department of Motor Vehicles has been alerted by law enforcement authorities to a potential security issue within its credit card processing services,” spokesman Armando Botello said in a statement. He added that the agency has opened an investigation “out of an abundance of caution” along with federal and state law enforcement agencies. The DMV allows clients to pay by credit card in online transactions and at self-service terminals at some locations, for transactions such as renewing driver’s licenses and vehicle registrations, Botello said in a phone interview. He declined to release other details about the potential breach, including how many customers might have had their data compromised and the time frame when it might have occurred. There is no evidence of a direct breach of the DMV’s computer system, Botello said in the statement. “In its investigation, the department is performing a forensic review of its systems and seeking information regarding any potential breach from both the external vendor that processes the DMV’s credit card transactions and the credit card companies themselves,” the statement said. The blog Krebs on Security first reported the suspected data breach, citing unnamed sources at financial institutions. It said the potentially compromised transactions occurred between Aug. 2 and Jan. 31 and the data that may have been stolen could include credit card numbers, expiration dates and three-digit security codes. Representatives from MasterCard Inc, Visa Inc, American Express Co and Discover Financial Services  could not immediately be reached for comment. MasterCard spokesman Seith Eisen told the Los Angeles Times the credit card company is “aware of and investigating” reports of a potential breach involving the California DMV. Last year, some 40 million payment card records were stolen from retailer Target, and Congress is investigating the breach along with lapses at other retailers. Credit card companies have pushed for better security. Earlier this year, upscale retailer Neiman Marcus  said a data breach potentially exposed payment card information at 77 of its 85 stores between last July and October.

435,TGT,"Target, security auditor Trustwave are sued over data breach","(Reuters) - Target Corp and Trustwave Holdings Inc, which provides credit card security services, have been sued by two banks for “monumental” losses they say card issuers will face because of the retailer’s holiday season data breach. In a complaint filed on Monday in Chicago federal court, Trustmark National Bank and Green Bank NA accused the defendants of failing to properly secure customer data, enabling the theft of about 40 million payment card records plus 70 million other records, including addresses and phone numbers. The banks said they lost money from alerting customers to the breach, reimbursing fraudulent charges and reissuing cards. These losses could increase, they said, if criminals ultimately use several million stolen cards as some analysts project. While the complaint seeks unspecified damages of at least $5 million, New York-based Trustmark and Houston-based Green Bank said losses could top $1 billion for card issuers they hope to represent in a class action, and $18 billion for banks and retailers combined. Target already faces dozen of lawsuits over the breach. Monday’s case may be the first to focus on Trustwave, a privately held Chicago-based company to which the banks said Target had outsourced some data security services. Molly Snyder, a Target spokeswoman, said the retailer did not discuss pending litigation. Trustwave spokeswoman Abby Ross said that company had a policy of not confirming its customers’ identities or discussing pending legal matters. The data breach occurred from November 27, the big shopping day known as Black Friday, to roughly December 15. In a Tuesday report issued ahead of a U.S. Senate committee hearing on protecting consumer data from cyber attacks, Senate staffers said Target “missed a number of opportunities” to stop the breach. According to the lawsuit, Minneapolis-based Target knew as early as 2007 that its systems were vulnerable but resisted making improvements, in part to keep costs down. It ultimately outsourced data security to Trustwave.

438,TGT,Banks sue security firm Trustwave over Target breach - American Banker,"March 26 (Reuters) - Trustmark National Bank and Green Bank N.A. have sued security firm Trustwave for damages suffered from the holiday season data breach at Target Corp, accusing the company of failing to identify security gaps, the American Banker reported. The two banks are seeking damages of more than $5 million and named Trustwave Holdings and Target as defendants, the American Banker said. (link.reuters.com/cas87v) The banks allege that the vulnerabilities in the Target system were either undetected or ignored by Trustwave, giving hackers access to millions of card accounts and personal records, the report said. Some 40 million payment card records were stolen from the discount retailer, along with 70 million other records with customer information such as addresses and telephone numbers, during the 2013 holiday shopping season. Target missed multiple opportunities to thwart the hackers responsible for the unprecedented holiday shopping season data breach, U.S. Senate staffers charged in a committee report released on Tuesday. The report also said Target gave access to its network to a third-party vendor that did not follow accepted information security practices. Target faces dozens of potential class-action lawsuits and action from banks that could seek reimbursement for millions of dollars in losses due to fraud and the cost of card replacements. Target and Trustwave were not available for comment outside regular business hours.

439,TGT,Security firm Trustwave says Target data breach claims baseless,"(Reuters) - Trustwave Holdings Inc, a credit-card security firm that has been sued along with Target Corp (TGT.N) over a sweeping data breach, said on Saturday it did not process cardholder data for the retailer or handle Target’s data security as a lawsuit alleges. In a letter to customers and business partners, Trustwave Chief Executive Robert McCullen said the company’s connection to Target was not what had been portrayed in a suit filed last Monday by two banks seeking at least $5 million in damages. “Contrary to the misstated allegations in the plaintiffs’ complaints, Target did not outsource its data security or IT obligations to Trustwave. Trustwave did not monitor Target’s network, nor did Trustwave process cardholder data for Target,” said the letter from McCullen posted on the company’s website. “These claims against Trustwave are without merit,” the letter added. The lawsuit filed in Chicago federal court by Trustmark National Bank and Green Bank NA accuses Target and Trustwave of failing to properly secure customer data, enabling the theft of about 40 million payment card records plus 70 million other records, including addresses and phone numbers. The banks said they lost money from alerting customers to the breach, reimbursing fraudulent charges and reissuing cards. Those losses could increase, they said, if criminals ultimately use several million stolen cards as some analysts project. While the complaint seeks unspecified damages of at least $5 million, New York-based Trustmark and Houston-based Green Bank said losses could top $1 billion for card issuers they hope to represent in a class action, and $18 billion for banks and retailers combined. Target, the no. 3 U.S. retailer, already faces dozen of lawsuits over the breach, but the lawsuit filed on Monday appears to be the first to focus on Trustwave, a privately held Chicago-based provider of credit-card security services.

442,TGT,U.S. Supreme Court could limit bank fraud law,"WASHINGTON, April 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared poised to limit the scope of a federal criminal law that targets people who defraud banks. A ruling along those lines could prevent federal prosecutors from using the law to crack down on routine fraud, such as the use of altered checks to purchase merchandise. In the future, prosecutors might have to show the defendant intended to defraud a bank in order to win a conviction using the law. Cases of fraud that do not include intent to defraud could still be prosecuted under state laws or potentially via another federal law that imposes shorter sentences. The case will not affect the ability of prosecutors to use the law to go after direct schemes to defraud financial institutions. The nine justices heard a one-hour oral argument on Tuesday  in an appeal brought by Kevin Loughrin, who was convicted in Salt Lake City, Utah, of six counts of bank fraud for stealing checks he then altered so he could purchase merchandise at Target Corp stores. Loughrin told police he intended to buy items using the checks, then return them for cash refunds. He was charged with using altered checks totaling $1,184. During the argument a majority of the justices appeared to agree with Loughrin’s lawyer that the federal government’s interpretation of the law was too broad but it was unclear exactly what limits the court would set. The court’s conservative members, in particular, are often concerned about expansive federal power at the expense of states. “This is a sweeping interpretation you’re offering us,” Justice Anthony Kennedy told Anthony Yang, assistant to the U.S. Solicitor General. Under the government’s approach, federal prosecutors could pursue cases involving “every fraudulent transaction in the economy, whenever a check is involved,” Kennedy added. Between 2006 and 2010 the government sought to prosecute nearly 3,000 cases using the statute, according to court papers. In Loughrin’s case, the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his conviction in a March 2013 ruling. Loughrin did not appeal his related convictions for identity theft and possession of stolen mail. A decision is expected by the end of June. The case is Loughrin v. United States, U.S. Supreme Court, 13-316.

446,TGT,U.S. retailers to share cyber threat data after Target attack,"BOSTON (Reuters) - U.S. retailers are planning to form an industry group for collecting and sharing intelligence about cyber security threats in a bid to prevent future attacks in the wake of last year’s big attack on Target Corp. The National Retail Federation said on Monday it will establish an Information Sharing and Analysis Center, or ISAC, for the retail industry in June. ISACs are industry groups that typically run security operations centers that operate around the clock, providing alerts about emerging threats to their members and sharing information provided by law enforcement and other government agencies. They are set up under terms of a 1998 U.S. presidential directive to foster sharing of security information between the public and private sector. There are more than a dozen such organizations among industries including financial services, emergency services, healthcare, technology companies, public transportation and utilities. The financial services industry ISAC, which is widely considered the most successful group of its type, will help retailers set up the new organization. Retailers have been under pressure from Congress and consumers to bolster security since the attack on Target, which resulted in the theft of some 40 million payment card numbers and another 70 million customer records, which were uncovered late last year. After the breach was uncovered, retailers privately complained that they had difficulty obtaining information from law enforcement about what had happened and how to thwart follow-on attacks. In January, the Department of Homeland Security produced a report titled “Indicators for Network Defenders” that contained information about its secret investigation into the Target breach. It was released through the Financial Services ISAC and other routes, but some retailers had trouble obtaining it because the industry lacked an established group for sharing information on cyber threats. The new ISAC will also allow retailers to share tips on fighting hackers, which the industry hopes might prevent future attacks and make consumer data more secure. “It will allow them to talk to each other about things are hitting them, to know quickly if other people are experiencing the same things and if they’ve found good defenses that they can tell each other about,” said Alan Paller, founder of SANS Institute, a non-profit group that trains security professionals.

449,TGT,"Espionage hacking grows, with more from east Europe - Verizon study","SAN FRANCISCO, April 22 (Reuters) - Hacking for espionage purposes is sharply increasing, with groups or national governments from Eastern Europe playing a growing role, according to one of the most comprehensive annual studies of computer intrusions. Spying intrusions traced back to any country in 2013 were blamed on residents of China and other East Asian nations 49 percent of the time, but Eastern European countries, especially Russian-speaking nations, were the suspected launching site for 21 percent of breaches, Verizon Communications Inc’s said in its annual Data Breach Investigations Report. Those were by far the most active areas detected in the sampling, which drew more than half of its data from victims in the United States. About 25 percent of spying incidents could not be attributed to attackers from any country, according to the authors of the report. Though the overall number of spying incidents studied tripled to 511 from total in the 2013 Verizon report, most of that increase is due to the addition of new data sources. Even looking at just the same contributors as before, however, espionage cases grew, said Verizon investigator Bryan Sartin. Not all electronic spying was blamed on governments. Investigators from Verizon, Intel Corp’s McAfee, Kaspersky Labs and other private companies and public agencies contributing data ascribed 11 percent of espionage attacks to organized criminals and 87 percent to governments. In some cases, the criminal gangs were probably looking to sell what they found to governments or competitors of the victims. “We do see a slight merging between the classic organized criminal and the espionage crook,” Sartin said, adding that he expected that trend to continue. If the rise of detected Eastern European spying comes as a surprise to those mainly familiar with accusations against China, a bigger surprise might be the study’s findings about attacks on retailers. Though recent breaches at Target Corp and other retailers through their point-of-sale equipment have dominated the headlines and prompted congressional hearings in the past few months, fewer such intrusions have been reported to the Verizon team than in past years, even as the number of report contributors has multiplied. “The media frenzy makes quite a splash, but from a frequency standpoint, this largely remains a small-and-medium business issue,” the study says. The report will be released to the public on Wednesday.

453,TGT,Target's decision to remove CEO rattles investors,"(Reuters) - Target Corp’s decision to oust Gregg Steinhafel as chairman and chief executive some five months after a massive data breach has triggered concerns the No. 3 U.S. retailer might have even more bad news for investors. The board of directors removed Steinhafel on Monday, saying it wants new leadership to help restore consumer confidence in the No. 2 U.S. discount retailer. “You got to wonder what prompted it now. What else will come to light,” said Dieter Waizenegger, executive director, of CtW Investment Group, which advises union pension funds with about $250 billion under management, including those owning about 3.3 million Target shares. The massive data breach and last year’s misguided push into Canada have already hurt profit and revenue. Analysts and shareholders expect to hear more of the same when the company reports results May 21 for the quarter ended May 3 and worry that the company could disclose other problems as well. “We would hazard a guess that first-quarter sales continued to be hurt by the data breach aftermath and that the Canada expansion is still in trouble,” Carol Levenson, an analyst with bond researcher Gimme Credit, said in a report. Target’s shares fell 3.5 percent to close at $59.87 on Monday, a sign investors were not convinced a change at the top alone would solve the problems facing the company. In the year up to Friday’s close, the stock fell 13.8 percent, while the S&P; 500 rose 15.6 percent. A 35-year veteran of the company, Steinhafel, 59, had been CEO since 2008. Just two years ago, the company was celebrated as the “cheap chic” alternative to No. 1 Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The Minneapolis-based company named Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan as interim chief executive, and Roxanne Austin, a member of the board of directors, as interim non-executive chairwoman of the board. The company said it hired recruiting firm Korn Ferry to help the board find a new CEO, indicating it is open to finding an outsider to guide it out of its current malaise, rather than pulling its next CEO from its executive ranks as it did when it promoted Steinhafel from president. FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said he believed Steinhafel, who will stay on in an advisory role for a while, is the first CEO to be removed following a major data breach. The timing of the sudden change in leadership, given all the problems that Target is facing, is hardly ideal, said Moody’s Investors Service, the credit rating firm. “We believe this to be a very inopportune time for a change at the top of Target, given the challenges the company is facing on multiple fronts,” Moody’s Vice President Charles O’Shea said. The most pressing tasks facing Steinhafel’s successor include fixing Target’s Canadian operations. Last year, it opened 124 stores along with three distribution centers in Canada, its first market outside the United States. No retailer has ever opened this many stores at one time in Canada. Nine more stores are planned for 2014. While the ambitious launch gave Target a hefty market presence immediately, it also created major logistics headaches. Expenses soared as Target over staffed stores and grappled with what it described as supply-chain congestion. That left many stores with barren shelves and complaining consumers, many of whom have been spoiled by less-expensive choices offered in Target stores just across the U.S. border. For 2013, the company reported a loss of nearly $1 billion in Canada on sales of $1.3 billion. Overall, the company reported a 34 percent drop in net profit last year to $1.97 billion. “Clearly, they just weren’t prepared,” said Maureen Atkinson, senior partner at Toronto-based global retail consultancy J.C. Williams Group. Target Canada President Tony Fisher was unavailable for comment, but a spokeswoman said the company is making progress. The problems extend beyond its supply chain, retail experts say. Target underestimated competition from both domestic retailers and its biggest rival, Wal-Mart. “I think they will get it right in the long run, but they’ve got a lot of fixing to do,” said Atkinson. “Unfortunately, for customers, it’s harder to forget than remember. Mulligan, the interim CEO, has served as the company’s chief spokesman on the data breach, holding up well under scrutiny during Congressional hearings. Target disclosed the cyber attack in December, revealing the theft of at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data. “He has played a key role in the recovery efforts,” said Target spokeswoman Dustee Jenkins. The impact of the breach is expected to have extended into the first quarter of the year. Analysts on average expect the company to report a decline of about 1 percent in first-quarter sales at established stores when it releases results in two weeks, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The Canadian component of the story is salt in the wound, but it is by no means the wound,” said Jim Danahy director of the Centre for Retail Leadership at York University in Toronto. “The wound for this company is without question the security breach.” ",5052014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-target-ceo/targets-decision-to-remove-ceo-rattles-investors-idUSBREA440BD20140505

457,TGT,CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Target removes CEO in wake of devastating cyber attack,"(Corrects paragraph 19 to fix name of former CIO to Beth Jacob from Beth Gladstone) By Siddharth Cavale and Jim Finkle May 5 (Reuters) - Target Corp removed Chairman and Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel on Monday in the wake of a devastating data breach that hurt the No. 3 U.S. retailer’s profits, shook customer confidence in the company and prompted congressional hearings. The departure of the 35-year company veteran also follows Target’s botched multi-billion dollar expansion into Canada. “After extensive discussions, the board and Gregg Steinhafel have decided that now is the right time for new leadership at Target,” the company’s board said in a statement. Steinhafel, 59, had been Target’s CEO since 2008. The Minneapolis-based company named Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan as interim chief executive, and Roxanne Austin, a member of Target’s board of directors, as interim non-executive chair of the board. Target’s shares fell as much as 3 percent in morning trading. Brian Sozzi, chief executive of Belus Capital Advisors, said he thought Steinhafel’s exit was a few months overdue. “I think the news today reflects Target’s initiative to completely get behind this issue,” he said, referring to the data breach. Target disclosed in December that a cyber attack had resulted in the theft of at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data. Mulligan has been the company’s chief spokesman on the issue, testifying at several congressional hearings where he was grilled for details about Target’s security operations, how it learned of the breach and how quickly it notified the public. Target spokeswoman Dustee Jenkins said Mulligan had been selected as interim CEO because of his role in helping company respond to the breach. “We believe he is suited for this. He has played a key role in the recovery efforts,” she said. The company said it has hired executive recruiting firm Korn Ferry to help the board find a new CEO. Apart from the breach, Target has had to negotiate a weak U.S. retail environment. The company’s push into Canada has also proven to be costlier than expected and sales have fallen far short of expectations. The company reported a loss of nearly $1 billion in Canada in 2013 on sales of $1.3 billion. Overall, the company reported a 34 percent drop in net profit last year to $1.97 billion. Analyst Ken Perkins of investment research firm Morningstar said the performance in Canada would have contributed to Steinhafel’s departure. “Clearly the data breach was not good publicity ... but in terms of an executive decision from a strategy point, the entry in Canada has really not gone the way company planned,” he said. The breach at Target was the second largest at a U.S. retailer. The theft of more than 90 million credit card details over about 18 months was uncovered in 2007 at TJX Cos Inc , operator of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains. Steinhafel’s exit follows the departure of Chief Information Officer Beth Jacob in March. The company last week named high-profile information technology consultant Bob DeRodes as her replacement. . Target is still looking for a chief information security officer, a new role. Target’s shares were down 3.1 percent at $60.11 in morning trading. In the year up to Friday’s close, the stock had fallen 13.8 percent, while the S&P; 500 rose 15.6 percent.

We are going to make progress and continue to make progress,” he said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, a day after the board the announced the departure of CEO and Chairman Gregg Steinhafel. “This is about driving our business forward and not just maintaining it.” Target shares fell 3.5 percent on Monday amid concerns the board’s decision to oust Steinhafel some five months after unprecedented data breach means that the No. 3 U.S. retailer might have even more bad news for investors. Yet Mulligan said in the interview that investigators have determined that the data theft was limited to what company has already disclosed — some 40 million payment card numbers and other data from about 70 million customers. The company had previously warned that the probe might reveal that the breach was more extensive than understood at the time. He said he could not provide an estimate on how much Target will have to pay to cover losses from the breach. “The largest exposure out there is third-party credit and debit card exposure,” he said. It will take several more months before the retailer understands the size of those losses, he added.

465,TGT,Target replaces president of money-losing Canadian unit,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) has fired the president of its money-losing Canadian operation and named a long-time U.S. executive with operational experience to try to repair its supply chain woes and win back customers. The third-biggest U.S. retailer, which will report quarterly financial results on Wednesday, said that vice president of merchandising operations Mark Schindele would immediately replace Tony Fisher as president of Target Canada. Target shares were down more than 2 percent on Tuesday afternoon, echoing declines from two weeks ago when the company fired Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Gregg Steinhafel, who led the company during a massive data breach in December. Some analysts said that Target needs to look beyond its ranks to address profound problems in Canada, which lost $941 million before interest and taxes last year, while generating $1.3 billion in sales. It had initially forecast a profit as early as the fourth quarter of 2013. “This is another example of Target looking from within and promoting somebody who may not necessarily have the overall experience to lead such a dramatic turnaround. The Canadian business has been a failure,” said Belus Capital Advisors chief equities strategist Brian Sozzi. Target said it is acting aggressively to make more rapid improvement in Canada. It also announced the creation of a new nonexecutive post for an adviser to the president of Target Canada, and has not yet named anyone to that position. “We recognize that we have work to do in Canada, and we felt it was important to get a new leader in place,” said Target spokeswoman Dustee Jenkins, referring to Schindele. Fisher could not immediately be reached for comment and Schindele was not talking to the media, Jenkins said. Schindele, 45, came to Target from Macy’s Inc (M.N) in 1999. During his 15 years at Target, he played an integral role in introducing such new store formats as PFresh, CityTarget and Target Express, the company said. “He has a great deal of experience in areas like forecasting, supply chain, distribution,” said Jenkins. Target Canada has been hurt by operational problems after opening 124 stores and three distribution centers last year in its first international venture. Sales have been weaker than expected as shoppers complained about empty shelves, higher prices and less selection than at U.S. Target stores. The Minneapolis-based company was overly ambitious and failed to manage expectations, industry experts say. “We think today’s news confirms that Target Canada has not progressed as the company would have liked,” Cowen and Co analyst Faye Landes said in a note to clients. “We also wonder why Target did not make an outside hire.” Sozzi, who expects “messy” financial results on Wednesday, said that Target should dramatically scale back its Canadian operations and focus on efficient operations so that it can better compete with Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N). “This is Target trying to house clean and hopefully get on this earnings call tomorrow and try to start the discussion that change is coming,” he said.

468,TGT,UPDATE 2-Target shows signs of turnaround but discounting mutes outlook,"(Adds analyst quotes, details on discounting and interest expense, updates shares) By Siddharth Cavale May 21 (Reuters) - Target Corp reported a 16 percent drop in first-quarter profit but showed some signs of progress in its efforts to rebuild customer confidence in the wake of a massive theft of payment card data and a botched expansion into Canada. Target, which has fired both its chief executive and the head of its Canadian operation as it tries to regain its footing, reported a 0.3 percent drop in U.S. same-store sales on Wednesday. Analysts had expected a fall of 1.1 percent. Target shares were flat at midday, reflecting lingering concerns about the company’s prospects as it resorts to discounts to win back customers and faces the daunting task of getting its business in Canada on track. “It could have been worse is the general refrain...”, said David Strasser, an analyst at Janney Capital Markets. “...It was not the disaster that was feared.” Target said traffic was “dramatically better” in the first quarter compared with late fourth-quarter trends. Even so, U.S. store traffic fell more than 2 percent in the quarter and total sales rose just 2.1 percent to $17.05 billion, only slightly better than analysts had expected. Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at investment firm Edward Jones, said he expected discounting - which hurt gross margins by more than a percentage point in the quarter - to continue until year-end when he expects traffic to start growing again. Traffic improved in February and March despite the harsh weather that other retailers have blamed for weak sales, interim Chief Executive John Mulligan said on a call with reporters. Mulligan, the company’s chief financial officer, replaced Gregg Steinhafel, who was ousted earlier in May after a data breach during the holiday shopping season resulted in the theft of at least 40 million payment card numbers. Steinhafel had also overseen Target’s bungled push into Canada, where the company lost almost $1 billion last year after opening 124 stores in an unprecedented expansion that caused supply chain and other operational problems. Target fired the head of its Canada operations, Tony Fisher, on Tuesday and replaced him with company veteran Mark Schindele. “We are not where we need to be (in Canada),” Mulligan said. The company lowered its adjusted full-year profit forecast to $3.60-$3.90 per share from $3.85-$4.15 to account for increased discounting and investments in e-commerce. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $3.98 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Target’s net income fell 16 percent to $418 million in the quarter ended May 3 even after benefiting from a year-earlier comparison that included a huge debt retirement charge related to the sale of the company’s credit card operations. Excluding items, the company earned 70 cents per share,  missing the average estimate by 1 cent. Target’s shares were up 0.4 percent at $56.62 at midday.

469,TGT,Exclusive: Target Canada's supply chain gridlock - how Barbie SUVs snarled traffic,"TORONTO (Reuters) - A pink Barbie-branded SUV that seats two toddlers offers a surprising glimpse into the myriad problems that jammed up Target Corp’s (TGT.N) supply chain when it set up shop in Canada, and the challenge facing Target’s new Canadian head. The toy was one of many products that piled up in bewildering volume at Target’s new distribution centers as it opened 124 stores across Canada last year, said two former employees of the company’s Canadian logistics contractor. Only a year ago, Target was touting its first store openings in Canada. Then Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel told investors he was pleased with how his workers and systems were handling the launch. But things were already going awry, said the sources, who worked at two of Target’s three distribution hubs and spoke on condition of anonymity. Goods were coming into the warehouses faster than they were going out, in part because the barcodes on many items did not match what was in the computer system. As shipments stacked up, Target flew in dozens of red-shirted staff from the United States to shore up the operation, the sources said. This insiders’ view, which has not been reported before, may partially explain why shoppers have been disappointed by empty shelves at some of Target’s Canadian stores. It is a cautionary tale for other U.S. retailers who may be considering a big push into Canada. Target, which reported another big quarterly loss in its Canadian operation on Wednesday, has said little about what went wrong with its supply chain in Canada. But on Tuesday it fired Tony Fisher, the president of its operation there, and replaced him with Mark Schindele, a veteran U.S. executive with deep experience in managing supply chains. Target’s launch into Canada, its first international venture, was code-named Project Bacon, an apparently playful reference to Canadian bacon sold in U.S. supermarkets. Instead of a slow province-by-province rollout, the retailer clinched a big real estate deal, locking itself into a rapid, coast-to-coast launch that later magnified supply chain problems. The company said in February it had “dramatically reduced” congestion in the supply chain but did not give details. Asked to comment on the sources’ depiction of overflowing warehouses, Target said it did not discuss vendor relationships. “We have been very clear that we need to improve operations and our guest experience in Canada,” spokeswoman Dustee Jenkins said in an emailed statement. She said Target was taking its challenges seriously and making changes. Target does much of its own distribution in the United States, but it hired Eleven Points Logistics, a subsidiary of Pittsburgh-based Genco, to run its three warehouses in Canada. Neither Eleven Points nor Genco responded to requests for comment. Located near the Quebec border, outside of Toronto and near Calgary, each warehouse covers some 1.5 million square feet, or about 26 American football fields. As goods arrived at the warehouses, workers found errors, 12 shirts per box when the computer system expected 24, for example, the two former Eleven Points employees said. It is not clear whether these errors were caused by Target’s buyers entering bad data, vendors making mistakes, some glitch in Eleven Points’ warehouse computer system or all three. The inconsistencies between goods and computer records caused a chain reaction of delays. Problem shipments needed to be unpacked and cataloged, a time-consuming process. They piled up instead of going out to stores, taking over large parts of the massive warehouses, on a scale the sources said they had never seen at previous jobs. Finding the source of this type of error can require a long and complex audit, said Marc Wulfraat, president of logistics consulting firm MWPVL International, who has analyzed and written about Target’s supply chain. “The Target Canada story will go down in the history books as one of the great supply chain disasters of Canadian history,” he said, pointing to the Canadian operation’s $941 million loss before interest and taxes last year. While Eleven Points ran the warehouses, teams of workers and managers, sometimes 30 or more at a time, would arrive from Target’s U.S. distribution centers to help resolve the choke points, the sources said. “They’d send a big sea of red shirts,” said one source. But the U.S. workers were used to different computer systems and stocking procedures, limiting the amount they could help. Many of the products that made it through processing and into the warehouses did not seem to sell, like the Barbie SUVs. These goods, selected by Target’s buyers, further clogged up the distribution system, the former Eleven Points employees said. Target decided early against gradual expansion in Canada, where competition for prime retail space is fierce. It concluded that the best way to get into key markets was to do a deal with either Sears Canada Inc. SCC.TO or Hudson Bay Co’s (HBC.TO) ailing discount chain Zellers, according to a British Columbia Labour Relations Board decision that drew on testimony from the company. The company decided that a Zellers deal offered the quickest route to “critical mass”. “It was a unique opportunity to get that big parcel of real estate,” said Antony Karabus, president of Hilco Retail Consulting, who has worked with retailers on both sides of the border. “In a sense, they were compelled to grow very fast.” That was a problem because Canadian supply chains are complicated. Goods have to travel huge distances, and tastes vary between regions. “How could you possibly stock 120 big stores with an assortment that probably need to vary meaningfully by region, and not make a ton of mistakes, operationally?” Karabus said. Reporting first quarter earnings, Target said it was seeing “early signs of improvement” in Canada. It disclosed a $211 million loss before interest and taxes, on $393 million in sales. The operation’s gross profit margin was 18.7 percent, compared with 29.5 percent in the United States. Target is not the first retailer to stumble in an international push. In 2012 home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc (HD.N) closed its big box stores in China after running into tough competition and misjudging local tastes. In 2006, Wal-Mart sold stores and exited South Korea, saying it would be difficult to reach the scale it required. New Target Canada president Schindele has his work cut out for him. More than a year in, some stores are still visibly under-stocked. At three Toronto stores that Reuters visited over the last week, there were still some empty shelves. One location had two cereal sections, and in some places boxes of Cheerios were lined up in single rows on shelves.

470,TGT,Target shows signs of turnaround as sales fall less than expected,"May 21 (Reuters) - Target Corp reported a 16 percent drop in quarterly profit but showed signs of progress in its efforts to rebuild customer confidence in the wake of a massive theft of payment card data in the United States and a botched expansion into Canada. Target, which has fired both its chief executive and the head of its Canadian operation as it tries to regain its footing, reported a 0.3 percent drop in U.S. same-store sales. Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had expected U.S. same-store sales to fall 1.1 percent. “Traffic was dramatically better than our late fourth-quarter trends,” the company said. Shares of the third-largest U.S. retailer were up 0.8 percent in premarket trading on Wednesday. Interim Chief Executive John Mulligan said the company was “pleased with this momentum” but that more needed to be done. Mulligan, the company’s chief financial officer, replaced Gregg Steinhafel, who was ousted earlier in May after a data breach during the holiday shopping season that resulted in the theft of at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data. Steinhafel had also overseen Target’s bungled push into Canada, where the company lost almost $1 billion last year after opening 124 stores in an unprecedented expansion that caused supply chain and other operational problems. Target fired the head of its Canada operations, Tony Fisher, on Tuesday and replaced him with company veteran Mark Schindele. The Minneapolis-based company lowered its adjusted full-year profit forecast to $3.60-$3.90 per share, from its prior forecast of $3.85-$4.15 per share. Analysts on average were expecting full-year earnings of $3.98 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income fell to $418 million, or 66 cents per share, in the first quarter ended May 3, from $498 million or 77 cents per share, a year earlier. Pre-tax costs related to the data breach totaled $26 million in the quarter, primarily for legal and other third party services. Including insurance proceeds, expenses were $18 million. The company incurred $61 million in pre-tax costs related to the breach in the preceding quarter. Excluding items, the company earned 70 cents per share. Sales rose 2.1 percent to $17.05 billion. Canadian sales were $393 million, up from $86 million in the same period last year when the company had only 24 stores. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 71 cents per share, on revenue of $17 billion. Target’s shares were trading at $57.07 before the bell, after closing at $56.61 on Tuesday. Up to Tuesday’s close, the stock had lost 10.5 percent since the start of the year.

471,TGT,Exclusive: Target Canada's supply chain gridlock: how Barbie SUVs snarled traffic,"TORONTO (Reuters) - A pink Barbie-branded SUV that seats two toddlers offers a surprising glimpse into the myriad problems that jammed up Target Corp’s supply chain when it set up shop in Canada, and the challenge facing Target’s new Canadian head. The toy was one of many products that piled up in bewildering volume at Target’s new distribution centers as it opened 124 stores across Canada last year, said two former employees of the company’s Canadian logistics contractor. Only a year ago, Target was touting its first store openings in Canada. Then Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel told investors he was pleased with how his workers and systems were handling the launch. But things were already going awry, said the sources, who worked at two of Target’s three distribution hubs and spoke on condition of anonymity. Goods were coming into the warehouses faster than they were going out, in part because the barcodes on many items did not match what was in the computer system. As shipments stacked up, Target flew in dozens of red-shirted staff from the United States to shore up the operation, the sources said. This insiders’ view, which has not been reported before, may partially explain why shoppers have been disappointed by empty shelves at some of Target’s Canadian stores. It is a cautionary tale for other U.S. retailers who may be considering a big push into Canada. Target, which is due to report its quarterly financial results on Wednesday, has said little about what went wrong with its Canadian supply chain. But on Tuesday it fired Tony Fisher, the president of its operation there, and replaced him with Mark Schindele, a veteran U.S. executive with deep experience in managing supply chains. Target’s launch into Canada, its first international venture, was code-named Project Bacon, an apparently playful reference to Canadian bacon sold in U.S. supermarkets. Instead of a slow province-by-province rollout, the retailer clinched a big real estate deal, locking itself into a rapid, coast-to-coast launch that later magnified supply chain problems. The company said in February it had “dramatically reduced” congestion in the supply chain but did not give details. Asked to comment on the sources’ depiction of overflowing warehouses, Target said it did not discuss vendor relationships. “We have been very clear that we need to improve operations and our guest experience in Canada,” spokeswoman Dustee Jenkins said in an emailed statement. She said Target was taking its challenges seriously and making changes. Target does much of its own distribution in the United States, but it hired Eleven Points Logistics, a subsidiary of Pittsburgh-based Genco, to run its three warehouses in Canada. Neither Eleven Points nor Genco responded to requests for comment. Located near the Quebec border, outside of Toronto and near Calgary, each warehouse covers some 1.5 million square feet, or about 26 American football fields. As goods arrived at the warehouses, workers found errors, 12 shirts per box when the computer system expected 24, for example, the two former Eleven Points employees said. It is not clear whether these errors were caused by Target’s buyers entering bad data, vendors making mistakes, some glitch in Eleven Points’ warehouse computer system or all three. The inconsistencies between goods and computer records caused a chain reaction of delays. Problem shipments needed to be unpacked and cataloged, a time-consuming process.

472,TGT,Proxy adviser ISS asks Target shareholders to vote against directors,"(Reuters) - Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services has recommended that Target Corp (TGT.N) shareholders vote against seven of the company’s 10 directors, saying the board failed to manage risks that led to a massive data breach. Target disclosed in December that a cyber attack had resulted in the theft of at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data weeks before Christmas. ISS blamed Target’s audit and corporate responsibility committees, which oversee risks such as fraud, for being “inadequately prepared” for risks of doing business in electronic commerce. “It appears that failure of the committees to ensure appropriate management of these risks set the stage for the data breach, which has resulted in significant losses to the company and its shareholders,” ISS said in its report. Ahead of Target’s shareholder meeting next month, ISS asked for a vote against directors including interim non-executive chair of the board Roxanne Austin, and others, namely Mary Minnick, Anne Mulcahy, Derica Rice, Calvin Darden, Henrique De Castro and James Johnson. The proxy firm also said a policy to separate chairman and CEO roles could improve the independent oversight of management.  Target’s board had not made a decision on whether to continue with an independent chair and will re-assess its leadership structure once a new CEO is announced, the company told Reuters in an email statement. “...following the criminal attack that resulted in the data breach, the board is re-examining the entire risk oversight structure, including senior management roles and reporting structures, as well as board oversight,” Target said. Earlier this month, Target removed Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel, who had been in the top job since 2008, and named John Mulligan as interim chief executive. Target’s shares have fallen 12.8 percent since the announcement of the breach to Wednesday’s close of $55.34 on the New York Stock Exchange.

474,TGT,UPDATE 1-U.S. retailers beat sales expectations in May,"(Adds details on Gap Inc sales, economic background) By Jeffrey Dastin June 5 (Reuters) - Average sales growth at 10 U.S. retailers, including Costco Wholesale Corp and Rite Aid Corp, topped expectations in May for a second month in a row as shoppers headed to malls in droves around the Memorial Day weekend, according Thomson Reuters data. Sales at established stores on average rose 4.4 percent in May, higher than the 3.9 percent increase analysts had estimated, according to the Thomson Reuters’ same-store sales index. The May increase followed a growth spurt in April, when same-store sales for the group rose 6.4 percent, buoyed by the release of pent-up demand after a harsh winter that had kept many consumers home. Most of the retail group, which excludes giants such as Walmart Stores Inc, Target Corp and Best Buy Co, exceeded or equaled sales growth in May 2013. “It’s not just warm weather,” said Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers. “In comparison, temperatures were nearly identical to last year. Presumably [the change] is more fundamental.” Niemira said he expected sales activity to moderate in June after April and May’s robust growth. The data is more evidence that the U.S. economy is picking up momentum after slowing during the winter, when weather was colder than usual in many parts of the country. Costco reported a 6 percent increase, stronger than the 4.8 percent that analysts had expected, and its shares rose more than 1 percent on Thursday. By contrast, apparel retailers were ahead of May forecasts, but their sales growth slowed after a strong April. Gap Inc reported 1 percent growth in comparable sales in May, compared with 7 percent growth in May 2013. L Brands Inc, which owns brands such as Victoria’s Secret, managed a 3 percent comparable sales increase after 8 percent growth in April. Drugstore operators Rite Aid and Walgreen Co  posted an average sales increase of 4.1 percent, slightly lower than analysts’ estimates, but higher than the average 2.8 percent growth they had recorded in May 2013.

Maiorino, who will join on June 16, will be responsible for the company’s information security and technology risk strategy, the third-largest U.S. retailer said on Tuesday.  The appointment was evidence of Target’s renewed focus on securing customer data to prevent a repeat of the data breach, Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman said. “While the average customer may not recognize the managerial changes, they should expect to see enhanced transactional security in the future,” Feldman said.

480,TGT,Fitch Affirms Target's IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 16 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed its long-term Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) on Target Corporation (Target) at 'A-', and its short-term IDR at  'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Target had $14.1 billion of debt outstanding  as of May 3, 2014. A full rating list is shown below. Key Rating Drivers: The affirmation reflects Target's strong competitive position in the discount  retail sector and steady but recently softer performance from its U.S. business.  These factors are balanced against a difficult market entry into Canada leading  to sizable operating losses, with challenges ahead in turning the business  around. The rating further reflects Fitch's expectation that financial leverage  will moderate over the next year to around 2.3x times from 2.55x currently.  Sales were soft in Target's U.S. segment in 2013, reflecting the challenging  environment facing low- and middle-income consumers, exacerbated by the data  breach that was announced one week before Christmas. Target's U.S. comp store  sales were down 0.4% in 2013 and down 0.3% in the first quarter of 2014 (1Q'14).  The EBIT margin narrowed from 7.8% to 7.0% during 2013 due primarily to lower  credit card income following the sale of the receivables portfolio to TD Bank in  March 2013, as well as investments made to support multichannel initiatives.   Fitch expects the challenging environment will likely continue to constrain  sales growth in the near term, with U.S. comp sales growing by 1%-2% for  full-year 2014, leading to modest domestic EBIT growth.  The significant shortfall in the performance of the Canadian business could  constrain Target's results over the medium term, as sales volumes are much lower  than initially expected. The costs associated with clearing excess inventory in  Canada were a major drag on Canada's earnings in 4Q'13 and into 1Q'14. The  Canadian business had EBITDA of negative $714 million in 2013, and Fitch expects  EBITDA losses will narrow by $250 million-$300 million in 2014.  However, generating positive EBITDA in Canada will be a significant challenge.  Assuming Canadian SG&A; (net of depreciation and amortization of $300 million) of  $1 billion to $1.1 billion and a 30% gross margin rate, sales in Canada would  have to reach $3.3 billion to $3.7 billion, essentially double the LTM sales  level of $1.62 billion, to reach a breakeven EBITDA level.  Fitch views the data breach, which was announced on Dec. 19, 2013, as a  manageable issue. The negative sales impact from the data breach continued into  fiscal 2014, but is starting to abate. Fitch expects other costs such as fraud  reimbursement, card reissuance costs and litigation will be manageable in the  context of the company's healthy ongoing cash flow.   Free cash flow (FCF) post-dividends is projected at around $1 billion beginning  in 2014, supported by a reduction in capex to around $2.4 billion in 2014 from  $3.5 billion in 2013 due to the completion of the Canadian store build-out.  Target has guided to share repurchases of $1 billion-$2 billion in 2014, but has  not given any guidance as to the cash costs of resolving the data breach  liabilities. It is expected that the company will size its share repurchases  based on its operating performance and the level of the data breach costs, and  that debt levels will be flat for the year.   Adjusted leverage was 2.55x at May 2014 compared with 2.4x at end-2013 (Feb. 1,  2014).  Leverage is expected to improve to 2.3x at end-2014 on flat debt levels  and improved EBITDA to $6.6 billion versus $6.2 billion in 2013, and to drift  down to the 2.1x-2.2x range over the next few years, which is consistent with  the company's long-term target.   Rating Sensitivities: A positive rating action could be triggered by improved operating momentum in  the domestic business, a successful turnaround in Canada, and a policy to  maintain leverage at or below 2.0x.  A negative rating action could be triggered by operating shortfalls and/or more  aggressive share repurchase activity that drove leverage to over 2.5x for an  extended period.   Fitch affirms the following: Target Corporation --Long-term IDR at 'A-';  --Senior unsecured debt at 'A-'; --Bank credit facility at 'A-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'.

481,TGT,Target sells $2 billion of bonds in two-part offering,"(Reuters) - U.S. retailer Target Corp (TGT.N) increased yields on Tuesday to sell $2 billion of bonds in a two-part offering and plans to use part of the proceeds to buy back as much as $1 billion of debt.  The company priced its five-year bonds to yield 2.348 percent on maturity, which is about 0.6 percentage point more than comparable U.S. Treasuries. Target priced its 10-year bonds to yield 3.553 percent, which is about 0.9 percentage points more than the standard rate.  Target said it planned to use proceeds from the sale of bonds to buy back as much as $1 billion of existing debt from among $3.76 billion of certain notes and debentures maturing between 2028 and 2038.

The company priced its five-year bonds to yield 2.348 percent on maturity, which is about 0.6 percentage point more than comparable U.S. Treasuries. Target priced its 10-year bonds to yield 3.553 percent, which is about 0.9 percentage points more than the standard rate.

483,TGT,California's top court says Target not required to carry in-store defibrillators,"SACRAMENTO (Reuters) - California’s top court on Monday unanimously ruled that large retailers are not required to provide automated external defibrillators (AEDs) inside their stores, deciding in favor of Target Corp in a wrongful death lawsuit brought after a shopper’s sudden death. The Supreme Court in California dismissed the argument that the U.S. retailer fell under a state health code statute that requires gyms and other “health studios” to make available the life-saving machines. “We conclude that, under California law, Target’s common law duty of care to its customers does not include a duty to acquire and make available an AED for use in a medical emergency,” the six-judge panel wrote in an opinion on Monday. The court’s decision was a defeat for the mother and brother of 49-year-old Mary Ann Verdugo, who died of a sudden heart attack while shopping with her at a Target store in 2008 Pico Rivera, California, a city near Los Angeles. The wrongful death lawsuit alleged the company violated a common law duty to provide first aid to the large volume of customers that frequent its California stores daily, noting that AEDs retail on its website for $1,200. “The inexpensive availability of AEDs and their ease of use with even minimal or no advance training have led to on-site CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) and AED assistance to now be an expected part of first aid response,” the Verdugo’s complaint said. The California Supreme Court upheld decisions by a U.S appeals court and lower courts that all ruled against the Verdugo family. “The safety and security of our guests and team members is our top priority and we are pleased with the California Supreme Court decision,” Target said in a statement.

486,TGT,UPDATE 1-Target 'respectfully' asks customers to keep their guns out of stores,"(Adds details, NRA controversy) By Lisa Maria Garza DALLAS, July 2 (Reuters) - U.S. retailer Target on Wednesday asked shoppers not to bring guns to its stores after protests against a gun-rights campaign in Texas where customers brandished firearms in store aisles. “Starting today we will ... respectfully request that guests not bring firearms to Target - even in communities where it is permitted by law,” Target chief executive John Mulligan said in a posting on its website. “This is a complicated issue, but it boils down to a simple belief: Bringing firearms to Target creates an environment that is at odds with the family-friendly shopping and work experience we strive to create,” said Mulligan. Groups advocating the unlicensed, open carrying of handguns have taken rifles and shotguns to restaurants and retailers mostly in Texas to draw attention to their cause, pointing to Texas laws that permit their actions. An advocacy group called Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America waged a social media campaign to boycott Target after photos circulated of open carry group members in Texas walking through stores with rifles and shotguns over their shoulders. “Moms everywhere were horrified to see images of people carrying loaded assault rifles down the same aisles where we shop for diapers and toys,” founder Shannon Watts said in a statement. Open Carry Tarrant County, a gun rights group in the Fort Worth area behind campaigns that have drawn some of the most attention, said on Wednesday members will continue to exercise their right to carry weapons in public. The group has parted ways with Open Carry Texas after disagreeing with the statewide group’s call to members to stop carrying long guns in restaurants. “They just want to shut up the cry babies who support more victims for criminals. The Unarmed!,” Open Carry Tarrant County group said on a Facebook posting. The National Rifle Association has weighed in on the debate, saying in a statement about a month ago that these sorts of open-carry tactics were “foolish,” “counterproductive” and “downright scary”. The powerful gun lobby group was severely criticized by open carry activists for its position and a few days later, it backed away, saying the statement was a mistake made by a staff member who had a poor choice of words, adding it supported open carry. . A number of national eateries, including Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, Sonic Drive-In, Chili’s Grill & Bar and Jack in the Box Inc have also asked patrons to keep their firearms at home. Top retailer Wal-Mart said it abides by the laws regarding open carry based on where its outlets are located.

489,TGT,CORRECTED-Insurers struggle to get grip on burgeoning cyber risk market,"(Corrects 15th paragraph to remove comment that was wrongly attributed to MMC executive and replace with comment from TrustedSec CEO) * U.S. cyber market seen reaching $2 bln this year * EU market much smaller, but growth seen surging * Insurers lack technical staff, experience By Leigh Thomas and Jim Finkle PARIS/BOSTON, July 14 (Reuters) - Insurers are eagerly eyeing exponential growth in the tiny cyber coverage market but their lack of experience and skills handling hackers and data breaches may keep their ambitions in check. High profile cases of hackers seizing sensitive customer data from companies, such as U.S. retailer Target Corp  or e-commerce company eBay Inc, have executives checking their insurance policies. Increasingly, corporate risk managers are seeing insurance against cyber crime as necessary budget spending rather than just nice to have. The insurance broking arm of Marsh & McLennan Companies  estimates the U.S cyber insurance market was worth $1 billion last year in gross written premiums and could reach as much as $2 billion this year. The European market is currently a fraction of that, at around $150 million, but is growing by 50 to 100 percent annually, according to Marsh. Those numbers represent a sliver of the overall insurance market, which is growing at a far more sluggish rate. Premiums are set to grow only 2.8 percent this year in inflation-adjusted terms, according to Munich Re, the world’s biggest reinsurer. The European cyber coverage market could get a big boost from draft EU data protection rules in the works that would force companies to disclose breaches of customer data to them. “Companies have become aware that the risk of being hacked is unavoidable,” said Andreas Schlayer, responsible for cyber risk insurance at Munich Re. “People are now more aware that hackers can attack and do great damage to central infrastructure, for example in the energy sector.” Insurers, which have more experience handling risks like hurricanes and fires, are now rushing to gain expertise in cyber technology. “It is a difficult risk to price by traditional insurance methods as there currently is not statistically significant actuarial data available,” said Robert Parisi, head of cyber products at insurance brokers Marsh. Andrew Braunbergon, research director at U.S. cybersecurity advisory company NSS Labs, said that some energy companies have trouble persuading insurers to provide them with cyber coverage as the industry is vulnerable to hacking attacks that could trigger disasters like an explosion in a worst-case scenario. Pricing on policies for retailers has climbed in the wake of recent high-profile breaches at Target, Neiman Marcus, and other merchants, he added. Though still very much in its infancy, the market’s potential is vast with cyber crime costing the global economy about $445 billion every year, according to an estimate last month from the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. While many companies have in the past counted on their general commercial liability policies for coverage, they are increasingly taking out standalone contracts. One reason for the change in attitude is a New York state court ruling in February against Sony Corp. The company, which has appealed the decision, had sought to force providers of its general commercial liability insurance to foot the bill for class action lawsuits following a major 2011 cyber attack on Sony PlayStation Network. The Sony ruling prompted some companies to get specialized insurance policies to protect them against cyber breaches, said Dave Kennedy, CEO of TrustedSec LLC, which helps businesses conduct security assessments before they obtain insurance. “There has been a huge uptick in cyber insurance,” he said. Target was better protected than Sony when some 40 million payment card numbers were stolen last year. It had $100 million in cyber insurance, according to the trade publication Business Insurance. With low interest rates limiting revenues from insurers’ vast bond portfolios, the extra underwriting income from the fast growing new market is all the more welcome. The cost of cyber insurance varies depending, but on average $1 million in protection ranges from about $20,000 to $25,000, according to MMC. German insurance giant Allianz says its premiums for 10-50 million euros in protection run about 50,000-90,000 euros in annual premiums. For protection of over 50 million euros, companies can get coverage up to 300 million euros through co-insurance policies involving multiple underwriters. Whether insurers are offering coverage at prices commensurate with the risks is anyone’s guess as long as underwriters have scant experience with hackers. AXA, Europe’s second biggest insurer, is making a big push into the cyber insurance market, but has so far not paid out a single business claim. “I would like to see a successful claim, because that would be an experience,” said Philippe Derieux, deputy CEO of AXA’s global property and causality business. AXA is hiring computer experts and engineers to build up a centralised cyber team, but Derieux said there is a shortage of qualified talent. “It is hard for insurers and brokers to find people able to handle the product,” Munich Re’s Schlayer said. That lack of expertise means insurers are failing to identify high-risk clients, because they are not undertaking sufficiently rigorous security evaluations before writing cyber policies, said Bryan Rose, managing director with Stroz Friedberg, a firm that investigates cyber attacks. This leaves the insurers vulnerable to underpricing their policies. They often simply ask clients to fill out limited questionnaires that asking whether they have proper security procedures in place, rather than conducting thorough security audits, Rose said. “There’s a real risk that insurance companies are not appropriately pricing the risk,” Rose said.

492,TGT,Target names outsider as CEO after data breach,"(Reuters) - Beleaguered retailer Target Corp named former PepsiCo and Wal-Mart executive Brian Cornell as CEO and chairman as it tries to regain customer confidence following a devastating data breach last year that hit earnings. Cornell, the first outsider to lead Target, has his work cut out. The company’s comparable store sales have declined in three of the last five quarters, while store visits have fallen for six straight quarters. An ambitious expansion into Canada last year has stumbled. The company opened a record 124 stores, but couldn’t keep shelves full due to delivery bottlenecks and customers complained of steep prices. The No.3 U.S. retailer has also been late to embrace e-commerce, lagging Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Amazon.com. From 2009 to 2012, Cornell led a turn-around at Sam’s Club, Wal-Mart’s slowest growing business at the time. In May 2012, he joined PepsiCo Inc to head the company’s largest business, Americas Foods unit, which makes Frito Lay chips and Quaker oats. “He did a very solid job at Sam’s,” Cowen & Co analyst Faye Landes said, citing that same-store sales growth at the membership-only stores jumped to 5.1 percent from 1.4 percent during Cornell’s tenure. The 55-year-old, who takes the top post at Target on Aug. 12, had been a contender to succeed PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi, according to the Wall Street Journal, which reported Cornell's appointment earlier on Thursday. (on.wsj.com/1xCMUqk) Before joining Sam’s Club, Cornell held the top job at arts and crafts chain Michael’s Stores Inc for two years. “... His experience at large retail and consumer product goods organizations should be instrumental in guiding Target,” Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman wrote in a note. Under previous CEO Gregg Steinhafel, Target focused on low-margin grocery items to entice frugal customers, turning away from its popular home and apparel products, which gave the company its cheap chic appeal. “I think the bottom line now is to renew merchandise with fresh styles,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. Refocusing on home and apparel will expand margins and widen its customer base, helping Target avoid a price war with Wal-Mart, Yarbrough said. Wal-Mart gets about 60 percent of its total U.S. revenue from selling groceries. Steinhafel was removed in May, after Target lost nearly $1 billion in Canada in 2013 and the data breach in the key holiday season led to the theft of at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other data. CFO John Mulligan has led Target in the interim and will now return full-time to his CFO duties after Cornell’s appointment. The company’s shares were down 2 percent at $60.20 in afternoon trading. The stock fell 11 percent in the weeks following the breach, but has made up for most of those losses since then to close at $61.38 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

495,TGT,"Target warns on profit as sales stay ""essentially flat""","(Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) cut its second-quarter profit estimate as it resorts to price cuts to attract cash-strapped consumers and win back customers unnerved by a huge holiday-season data breach. The warning on Tuesday showed that new Chief Executive Brian Cornell, who takes over the third-largest U.S. retailer next week, has his work cut out for him. “The new boss ... inherits a fine mess,” Carol Levenson, director of research at Gimme Credit, an independent corporate bond research service, said in a note. Sales at U.S. mass merchandisers such as Target and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) have been hit as consumers struggling with stagnant wages and higher taxes cut back on spending. But Target faces the additional task of rebuilding its reputation after a data breach resulted in the theft of 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data such as email addresses and phone numbers. Target, whose shares were down 4.18 percent at $58.19 in afternoon trading, said same-store sales in the United States were “essentially flat” in the second quarter ended July. “The core mass merchandisers are all struggling and Target is struggling with the rest of them,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough told Reuters. “But it is a little bit concerning that though they have pushed the lever on promotional spending it is still not driving traffic,” he said. Target’s same-store sales have fallen in three of the past five quarters. The company said on Tuesday it expected expenses of $110 million, net of insurance, related to the data breach in the quarter, compared with $18 million in the first quarter. Costs increased due to a rise in actual and potential breach-related claims, including claims by payment card networks, the company said. The company also said its sales in Canada were softer than expected in the latest quarter. The retailer lost nearly $1 billion north of the border last year after an aggressive expansion plan stumbled. Target said net income would also be reduced due to a payment of $1 billion to retire $725 million in long-term debt. Excluding costs related to the data breach and debt, Target said it expected a second-quarter profit of 78 cents per share. The company had said in May that it expected earnings of 85 cents to $1.00 per share. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 91 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Cornell, a 55-year old former PepsiCo Inc PEP.N and Wal-Mart executive who is considered a merchandise specialist, takes over on Aug. 12. He is the first outsider to run the company. Up to Monday’s close, Target’s stock had risen about 4.6 percent since it issued its previous second-quarter forecast in May.

The warning on Tuesday showed that new Chief Executive Brian Cornell, who takes over the third-largest U.S. retailer next week, has his work cut out for him. “The new boss ... inherits a fine mess,” Carol Levenson, director of research at Gimme Credit, an independent corporate bond research service, said in a note.

497,TGT,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Dollar, bond yields up after U.S. data; Europe shares higher","* Dollar strengthens on strong U.S. services, factory figures * European shares rise after encouraging earnings reports * Asia hit by unexpected weakness in China services PMI * Wall Street pares declines after data   (Adds U.S. market open, quote; changes dateline; previous LONDON) By Chuck Mikolajczak New York, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar strengthened and bond yields rose on Tuesday after strong data on factory orders and service-sector growth, while European shares gained modestly after earnings reports. Wall Street was modestly weaker, as investors reacted negatively to earnings from Cablevision and a warning on weak sales from Target Corp. The dollar hit its highest level since September 2013 against a basket of currencies after the Institute for Supply Management said service-sector growth in the United States hit an eight-and-a-half-year peak on strong growth in new orders and employment. Factory orders were also strong in July and data showed positive revisions to durable goods orders, a sign that the economy continues to improve. The euro fell to a day’s low of $1.3357 after the U.S. data, while the dollar rose against the yen to 102.86, continuing a trend of strength in the U.S. currency. “Generally, the dollar started off on a stronger footing this morning and certainly the strengthening of the data has helped that rally,” said Brian Daingerfield, currency strategist at the Royal Bank of Scotland in Stamford, Connecticut. U.S. 10-year yields hit a session high of 2.53 after the manufacturing and services data. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 7/32, the yield at 2.5143 percent. The U.S. data was offset somewhat by weak figures out of China, where the HSBC/Markit services PMI fell to 50.0 in July, the lowest since November 2005, from a 15-month high of 53.1 in June. It suggests a recovery in the world’s second-largest economy may need further government support. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 55.47 points, or 0.33 percent, at 16,513.81. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was down 6.35 points, or 0.33 percent, at 1,932.64. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 6.63 points, or 0.15 percent, at 4,377.26. Shares of Cablevision fell 5 percent after the company said subscriber losses doubled in the second quarter, while Target was down 2.8 percent after saying U.S. and Canadian sales have been challenging. The MSCI All-World Index fell 0.4 percent. European PMI figures showed the continent’s economy was growing, as expected. But manufacturing remained weak and kept intact expectations the European Central Bank will ease monetary policy further and pressured the euro. Investors in Europe were cheered by forecast-beating results from German luxury carmaker BMW and France’s third-biggest listed bank, Credit Agricole, among others. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading shares was up 0.4 percent, a small recovery from its near 4 percent fall over the past two weeks on concerns over financial uncertainty for Portugal’s Banco Espirito Santo, which was later bailed out. In commodities markets, Brent crude slipped below $105 a barrel, falling $1.12 to $104.29 as ample supplies outweighed Middle East turmoil, while U.S. crude shed 85 cents to $97.44.

However, deflationary pressures continued to weigh on the bloc. * Two separate readings on the U.S. services sector are due in the first half hour after the market opens on Tuesday. * S&P; 500 e-mini futures were down 9 points and fair value - a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract - indicated a lower open.

499,TGT,Target says supply chain 'reset' will help fix Canada woes,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) is repairing the supply chain problems it holds largely responsible for last year’s botched Canadian expansion and expects to show measurable progress on a turnaround by this fall, its top executive in Canada said on Tuesday. In its first international expansion, Minneapolis-based Target opened an unprecedented 124 stores and three distribution centers in Canada last year, losing nearly $1 billion as sales fell far short of expectations. Disappointed shoppers complained of higher prices than in U.S. stores, poor selection, and empty shelves, and distribution center workers told Reuters that poor planning led to supply chain problems that began long before the first store opened.  “With the benefit of hindsight, if we could do it all over again, we wouldn’t have opened up that many stores, that many DCs (distribution centers), in that short a time frame. I know that much,” Mark Schindele, Target Canada’s new president, told Reuters. “We’re now unwinding some of the decisions we made that were based on speed.” Some analysts say that Target, which was also hurt badly by a massive U.S. data breach late last year that involved 40 million payment card numbers, should cut its losses in Canada and either close poorly performing stores or pull out entirely. Schindele, a 15-year Target veteran who came to Canada in May, said the company is focused on improving all of its stores and would not answer questions about whether any closures are being considered.   The discount retailer is pushing a three-pronged turnaround plan that will focus on its supply chain, pricing, and merchandise selection. As a first step, all 130 stores are counting their inventory, to help “reset” an overwhelmed supply chain. Most stores have completed that work and are reporting significantly fuller shelves, Schindele said. He added that the rapid pace of Target’s entry resulted in problems with the set-up of its all-new Canadian technology systems due to hastily made decisions. A key issue, distribution center staff had told Reuters, was that shipments of many products coming into warehouses did not match data in Target’s computer system. That created a bottleneck as staff scrambled to reconcile differences. Schindele said that when the system was first set up, minimum order quantities were not aggregated at the vendor level, as is typically done, but by the distribution centers, which made tracking purchase orders difficult. “If your data integrity isn’t good, it’s really hard to keep stores in stock,” he said.  With one year of operations under its belt, Target Canada now has sales data to help forecast demand and allocate products. Schindele said excess inventory problems have been   alleviated significantly since last year. The recovery plan, which reflects work with two different consultants, also includes retraining staff. Workers were initially pushing inventory through the system, rather than allowing the software to do its job, Schindele said. Technology will be reconfigured and stores will also see merchandise shipped more frequently. “We expect to see measurable progress this fall,” Schindele said, but did not provide details. In response to customer complaints, the company said it is changing its price-match policy to add Canadian online retailers such as Amazon.ca and Walmart.ca, while allowing shoppers to use popular price matching apps. The cheap-chic retailer will add 30,000 new products and expand its line of exclusive products, including a partnership with Canadian celebrity interior designer Sarah Richardson to try to boost sales. Executives would not provide any Canadian sales or profit growth targets or say how much the repair plan will cost. Target cut its second-quarter profit estimate last week and said Canadian sales were softer than expected. The company is scheduled to report results on Aug. 20.  New Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell officially starts work on Tuesday, but he was briefed by Schindele last week on the recovery plan and will tour Target stores when he visits Canada this week.

505,TGT,Target cuts forecast as it woos back customers with more discounts,"(Reuters) - Target Corp cut its full-year earnings forecast as it offers more discounts to attract cash-strapped customers and win over shoppers unnerved by a massive holiday-season data breach. The third-largest U.S. retailer, however, said sales and traffic have improved in the past few weeks as the back-to-school season begins.  Target’s shares rose 1 percent to $59.81 in noon trading.  The company’s U.S. same-store sales rose more than 1 percent in July, Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan said in a statement. Sales have been “better” in August, driven by demand for back-to-school items, he said. Sales at U.S. mass merchandisers such as Target and Wal-Mart Stores Inc have been hit this year as consumers struggling with stagnant wages and high inflation reduce spending.  On top of that, Target has run up big losses in Canada, where its ambitious expansion has stumbled due to supply chain issues and a backlash from customers who had expected prices to be more in line with those in the United States.  Target’s same-store sales have either declined or failed to show growth in the past six quarters. Customer traffic has fallen for nine straight quarters, but is now showing signs of recovery.  The fall in traffic slowed to 1.3 percent in the second quarter from 2.3 percent in the first quarter. “A vast majority of guests have come back to us ... Trust and confidence is returning to Target,” Mulligan said on a call, adding that discounting was a contributing factor.  Target replaced its CEO Gregg Steinhafel with former Wal-Mart executive Brian Cornell after the data breach in the holiday shopping season last year led to the theft of at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data. “I think slowly and maturely that the confidence is coming back and bulk of the shoppers shopping there again are getting comfortable,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough told Reuters. Still, Target cut its full-year adjusted profit forecast to $3.10-$3.30 per share from $3.60-3.90, saying it was cautious due to sales and margin trends so far this year. Analysts on average were expecting $3.49 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Target said earlier this month that the data breach had cost it a net $111 million so far after taking insurance into account. The company did not provide an updated figure on Wednesday. Net profit fell 62 percent to $234 million, or 37 cents per share, in the quarter ended Aug. 2. Excluding items, the company earned 78 cents per share.  Total sales rose 1.7 percent to $17.41 billion. Analysts on average expected earnings of 79 cents per share, and revenue of $17.38 billion.

Investors will peruse the Fed minutes, which will be released at 2:00 p.m. (1800 GMT), for clues on how soon the central bank plans to hike interest rates. At a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in July, the Fed had trimmed its monthly bond-buying program by an additional $10 billion. An annual meeting of top central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, from Thursday through Saturday will also be eyed for possible insight into the path for U.S. monetary policy. “We know what is going to happen this year, we are looking into next year and for that we need the sort of stuff that comes out of this conference,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst, Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. The benchmark S&P; 500 is less than 10 points off an all-time intraday high of 1,991.39 reached on July 24. Lowe’s Companies shed 0.4 percent to $51.29, paring earlier losses after it cut its full-year sales forecast. The world’s No. 2 home improvement products retailer reported better-than-expected second-quarter results. Fellow retailer Target Corp rose 0.9 percent to $59.78, shaking off initial declines after second-quarter earnings fell shy of analysts’ estimates and the company cut its full-year outlook. The S&P; retail index gained 0.3 percent and was on track for its fifth gain in six sessions. Lowe’s and Target “are companies with specific issues as opposed to representing what is going on in the broader retail market,” Forrest said. “(Target) has a path out of it, they’ve changed the leadership that brought these results and Wall Street is always willing to overlook someone else’s results.” The Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.45 points or 0.08 percent, to 16,933.04, the S&P; 500 gained 0.42 points or 0.02 percent, to 1,982.02 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 7.03 points or 0.16 percent, to 4,520.49.

510,TGT,Target cuts full-year profit forecast,"Aug 20 (Reuters) - Target Corp reported a 62 percent drop in second-quarter profit and cut its full-year earnings forecast as it resorts to price cuts to attract cash-strapped consumers and win over shoppers unnerved by a massive holiday-season data breach. Target, whose shares were down 2.5 percent at $57.75 in premarket trading on Wednesday, cut its full-year adjusted profit forecast to $3.10-$3.30 per share from $3.60-3.90. The company cut its earnings estimate for the second quarter earlier this month, saying a pullback in consumer spending had led to weak sales. The profit announced on Wednesday matched the company’s estimate released on Aug. 5. Target also said then that the data breach, which resulted in the theft of at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data, had cost it a net $111 million so far after taking insurance into account. The company did not provide an updated figure on Wednesday. Sales at U.S. mass merchandisers such as Target and Wal-Mart Stores Inc have been hit as consumers struggling with stagnant wages and higher taxes reduce spending. On top of that, Target has also run up big losses in Canada where its ambitious expansion has stumbled due to supply chain issues and a backlash from consumers who had expected prices to be more in line with those in the United States. Target said its net profit fell to $234 million, or 37 cents per share, in the three months ended Aug. 2, from $611 million, or 95 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 78 cents per share. Total sales rose 1.7 percent to $17.41 billion, while sales at stores open for at least a year were flat. Analysts on average expected earnings of 79 cents per share, on revenue of $17.38 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 29 retailers that had reported second-quarter earnings as of Tuesday, 45 percent had missed the average analyst estimate, 38 percent exceeded and 17 percent were in line, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

511,TGT,Ohio appoints special prosecutor for fatal police shooting at Walmart,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Ohio’s attorney general said on Tuesday he has assigned a prosecutor with experience in police-involved shootings to investigate the death of a man shot while holding a BB gun at a Dayton-area Walmart. But lawyers for the family of John Crawford III, who was shot and killed by Beavercreek police earlier this month, said his death was unjustified, demanded that all surveillance video of the shooting be released and called for the case to be turned over to federal authorities. Attorney General Mike DeWine told reporters that Mark Piepmeier of Hamilton County has been assigned as the special prosecutor for the case, which will go before a special grand jury on Sept. 22.  “What happened on August 5 is a true tragedy ...” DeWine said. “Mr. Piepmeier will do everything in his power to seek justice in this case.” Crawford’s death came a few days before the Aug. 9 fatal shooting by police in Ferguson, Missouri, of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, which is being investigated by the U.S. Justice Department and has focused national attention on the use of deadly force by police. Beavercreek police say they shot and killed Crawford because he was waving the BB gun and didn’t drop it when commanded by police, according to local media accounts. Lawyers for the Crawford family and Crawford’s father have viewed 5 to 6 minutes of surveillance video of the shooting. The lawyers said at a news conference on Tuesday that Crawford was talking on a cell phone and had picked up the gun off a shelf. “He was doing nothing more, nothing less than just shopping,” attorney Michael Wright said. Crawford’s father, John Crawford Jr., told reporters he was concerned about the delay in the justice system dealing with the officers involved. Beavercreek police asked the attorney general to take over the Ohio investigation, and the local county prosecutor said a special prosecutor was needed. A representative for the Beavercreek police was not immediately available for comment. Piepmeier, who has been involved in investigating more than 100 officer-involved use of force cases, will begin the special grand jury proceedings on Sept. 22.

512,TGT,UPDATE 2-Home Depot says probing 'unusual activity' after data breach report,"* Company says cannot confirm if hit by data security breach * Home Depot shares drop 2 pct on news * Security analyst says breach could affect 2,200 U.S. stores   (Adds website’s report of possible breach, details of Target breach, industry background, closing share price) By Nandita Bose and Nathan Layne Sept 2 (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc said on Tuesday it was working with law enforcement to investigate “some unusual activity” related to customer data but that it could not confirm if it had become the latest retailer to be hit by a large-scale security breach. Shares of the home improvement chain closed 2 percent lower at $91.15 on the news, which highlights growing scrutiny of data security in the retail industry following a massive breach at Target Corp last year. “At this point, I can confirm that we’re looking into some unusual activity and we are working with our banking partners and law enforcement to investigate,” Home Depot representative  Paula Drake wrote in an emailed statement to Reuters. “If we confirm that a breach has occurred, we will make sure customers are notified immediately.” The statement came after security website KrebsonSecurity first reported that multiple banks had seen evidence that Home Depot may be the source of stolen credit and debit cards put up for sale on underground markets. Brian Krebs, who runs the website, could not be immediately reached for comment. Krebs wrote on his website that his preliminary analysis indicated the problem could affect all of Home Depot’s 2,200 stores in the United States. He said several banks he contacted believed the breach could extend back to April or May of this year. “If that is accurate - and if even a majority of Home Depot stores were compromised - this breach could be many times larger than Target,” Krebs wrote. In the Target breach, which hit the retailer during the important year-end holiday shopping season, hackers stole at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data. The incident cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars and prompted numerous investigations by attorneys general and congressional hearings and inquiries. In May, the company ousted its CEO, Gregg Steinhafel, who has now been replaced by former Wal-Mart Stores Inc executive Brian Cornell. Numerous companies have come under the spotlight for potential breaches in recent months. In some situations, companies that conduct investigations into data breaches may not be able to come to a definitive conclusion. For instance, Sears Holdings Corp said in February that an investigation into a possible data breach did not reveal conclusive information. Retailers have been taking steps to better protect customer data. Wal-Mart Stores Inc said last week that 4,600 of its group stores were now using payment terminals capable of reading credit and debit cards that store information on computer chips. Such cards are more secure than conventional ones that store data on magnetic stripes. The bulk of those stores activated the terminals this year, spokesman Randy Hargrove said. The retailer plans to activate terminals in its remaining U.S. stores by the end of 2014.

Almost a week after security blogger Brian Krebs warned that Home Depot could be the victim of a breach extending to more than 2,000 U.S. stores, the home improvement chain has not confirmed or denied that one had occurred. The company said Tuesday that it was working with authorities to investigate the matter. By contrast, Target made initial disclosures on its breach’s scope but later revised them in a series of updates that confused and angered consumers, hitting sales and contributing to Chief Executive Officer Gregg Steinhafel’s departure.  In its minimalist communication strategy, Home Depot likely is drawing lessons from Target, avoiding an incremental approach that risks giving the impression that it does not have a complete grasp of the problem, crisis management experts said. “When you have criminal behavior, you don’t know right away what all the ramifications are,” said Davia Temin, head of a consultancy focused on crisis and reputation management. “It’s really hard when you are trying to overcommunicate not to misstate reality.” Target in December used its first disclosure to say 40 million credit and debit cards might have been compromised. A week later it said encrypted PIN data had been stolen. And in January, it said data on up to 70 million people might have been taken. Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said the company had moved quickly to inform customers as facts were uncovered during a complex investigation.  To be sure, the situations facing Target and Home Depot are not exactly the same. While Target knew it was dealing with data theft, Home Depot has held on to the possibility that no breach has occurred.  “When you are in a situation like this you have a choice,” Home Depot CEO Frank Blake said at an investor conference on Thursday. “On the one hand, you can wait to communicate anything until you have the facts at hand, or you can communicate the facts as you know them. We chose the latter path.” Blake did not address Krebs’ reporting, including his estimate on the scope of the possible breach. Home Depot spokeswoman Paula Drake said on Monday that the company did not have any updates on the situation.    A spate of recent breaches has tested crisis communications across the retail sector.

515,TGT,RPT-UPDATE 2-Home Depot confirms security breach following Target data theft,"(Repeats with no changes to additional subscribers)  (Adds breach details, attorney comments, share price) By Nandita Bose CHICAGO, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc confirmed on Monday its payment security systems have been breached, a data theft analysts warn could rival Target Corp’s  massive breach last year. Home Depot said the data theft could impact its customers in stores across the United States and Canada, but there was no evidence that online customers were affected or debit personal identification numbers (PINs) were compromised. “We owe it to our customers to alert them that we now have enough evidence to confirm that a breach has indeed occurred,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frank Blake said in a statement. “It is important to emphasize that no customers will be responsible for fraudulent charges to their accounts.” The breach was first reported by security website KrebsOnSecurity almost a week ago. It said the problem could extend back to April and affect all of Home Depot’s 2,200 stores in the United States. No details were immediately available on how many customers were impacted. But Brian Krebs, who runs the security website, said last week the breach could be larger than Target’s last year when hackers stole at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data. Krebs reported on Monday that Home Depot’s systems were hit by a variant of the same malware that compromised Target’s systems last year. Target has spent $146 million to resolve data breach-related issues since the fourth quarter of 2013. Most of these expenses were for settling actual and potential breach-related claims, mainly by payment card networks. The largest known breach at a U.S. retailer was uncovered in 2007 at TJX Cos Inc, operator of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains, which had more than 90 million credit cards stolen over about 18 months. Home Depot said it started investigating the data breach last Tuesday, but the investigation will look at data from April. “It doesn’t exactly say a lot of good things about their data security systems if something was able to go on for months and they didn’t notice,” said Kenneth Dort, partner at intellectual property practice group, Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP. Home Depot promised free identity-protection services, including credit monitoring, to any potentially impacted customers. Home Depot had said earlier it will roll out PIN- and chip-enabled cards at all its U.S. stores by the end of the year. The retailer also said its internal information technology security team is working with banking partners, firms including Symantec Corp and Fishnet Security, as well as the U.S Secret Service to gather facts in the investigation, it said. Shares of Home Depot ended 0.86 percent lower at $90.82 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.

516,TGT,Home Depot sued by customer over data breach,"(Reuters) - Home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc (HD.N) has been sued over data breach by a customer, saying the company failed to properly safeguard customer data from hackers, a lawsuit filed in a Chicago federal court showed on Tuesday. The lawsuit comes a day after Home Depot confirmed that its payment security systems have been breached, potentially impacting its customers in stores across the United States and Canada.  Illinois resident Kelsey O’Brien filed the lawsuit, seeking class-action status, compensatory and punitive damages and credit card monitoring services for a period of three years. O’Brien said he used his credit card at two Home Depot stores on May 19 and June 2 and had his personal financial information exposed. Home Depot had failed to comply with reasonable security standards at the expense and to the severe detriment of its own customers, the lawsuit said. Several stolen card details were placed for sale on an underground website notorious for offering stolen card data and were being used to change the PIN numbers, it said. “We haven’t seen the suit yet and right now we are focused on our customers and the investigation, so it would be premature to comment,” Stephen Holmes, a Home Depot spokesman said. The retailer said there was no evidence that online customers were affected or debit personal identification numbers (PINs) were compromised, but experts fear the attack could rival Target Corp’s (TGT.N) massive breach last year. Home Depot said customers who shopped at its stores as far back as April were exposed, suggesting the breach extended through the busy summer season. The company, which had said earlier it would roll out PIN- and chip-enabled cards at all its U.S. stores, has promised free identity-protection services, including credit monitoring, to any potentially impacted customers. The breach was first reported by security website KrebsOnSecurity last Tuesday. Krebs said on Sunday that Home Depot’s systems were hit by a variant of the same malware that compromised Target’s systems last year.  Target’s data breach weeks before Christmas led to theft of about 40 million credit and debit card records and 70 million other records with customer details. Two senators asked the federal government to investigate the Home Depot breach and five U.S. states launched a probe into the matter on Tuesday as fallout from last week’s attack intensified.  Home Depot runs 2,266 stores across the United States and Canada. The company’s shares closed down about 2 percent at $88.93 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

517,TGT,UPDATE 2-Home Depot breach bigger than Target at 56 mln cards,"(Recasts, adds details about costs of breach and likelihood of costs rising, comment from computer security experts, background) By Jim Finkle and Nandita Bose BOSTON/CHICAGO, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc  Thursday said some 56 million payment cards were likely compromised in a cyberattack at its stores, suggesting the hacking attack at the home improvement chain was larger than last year’s unprecedented breach at Target Corp. Home Depot, in providing the first clues to how much the breach would cost, said that so far it has estimated costs of $62 million. But it indicated that costs could reach much higher. It will take months to determine the full scope of the fraud, which affected Home Depot stores in both the United States and Canada and ran from April to September. Retailer Target incurred costs of $148 million in its second fiscal quarter related to its breach. Target hackers stole at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data. Home Depot said that criminals used unique, custom-built software that had not been seen in previous attacks and was designed to evade detection in its most complete account of what had happened since it first disclosed the breach on Sept. 8. The company said that the hackers’ method of entry has been closed off, the malware eliminated from its network, and that it had rolled out “enhanced encryption of payment data” to all U.S. stores. “We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience and anxiety this has caused and want to reassure them that they will not be liable for fraudulent charges,” Chief Executive Frank Blake said in a statement. Of the estimated cost so far of $62 million, which covers such items as credit monitoring, increased call center staffing, and legal and professional services, Home Depot said it believes that $27 million of the amount will be paid for by insurers. But the company said it has not yet estimated the impact of “probable losses” related to the possible need to reimburse banks for fraud and card replacement, as well as covering costs of lawsuits and government investigations. “Those costs may have a material adverse effect on The Home Depot’s financial results in the fourth quarter and/or future periods,” the company said in its statement. Wesley McGrew, an expert of retail breaches who is an assistant research professor at the department of computer science at Mississippi State University, said that Home Depot is going to be expected to bear the costs related to fraud and payment card replacement. Banks typically seek to get retailers to cover those costs if there are any indications of shortcomings in their security. Criminals have frequently used software that evades detection, but retailers are expected to closely monitor their networks using tools that are designed to uncover signs of a crime in progress, McGrew said. “It’s hard to feel sorry for them when there are things they could have done to improve the security of these transactions,” McGrew said. Hitesh Sheth, chief executive of Vectra Networks, a cybersecurity firm in San Jose, California, said Home Depot’s breach exposes a weakness, noting that the company said hackers used unique, custom-built malware. That “essentially means the technology they are using is only designed to detect malware that has already been used in a previous attack, and that is symptomatic of the retail industry,” Sheth said. “Retailers need to upgrade to technology that is available and detects behavior of malware that is new because these attacks are not going to stop anytime soon.” For its fiscal year ending in February, Home Depot revised its earnings estimate to $4.54 per share from $4.52. In addition to the cost related to the breach, it said the estimate includes a pre-tax gain of about $100 million on the sale of 3.6 million common shares of HD Supply stock.

519,TGT,Ohio grand jury decides not to charge officers in Walmart shooting,"(Reuters) - An Ohio grand jury on Wednesday decided not to press charges against two police officers who fatally shot a man while he held a pellet gun at a Dayton-area Walmart in August, prosecutors said.  A special Green County grand jury voted not to indict two Beavercreek officers who shot and killed John Crawford III, 22, on Aug. 5 as he held a BB gun inside a local Walmart store, special prosecutor Mark Piepmeier told a news conference.   “Based on the information the responding officers had and Mr. Crawford’s failure to comply with the responding officers’ orders, the officers did what they were trained to do to protect the public,” the City of Beavercreek said in a statement.  Crawford’s death came a few days before the Aug. 9 fatal shooting by police in Ferguson, Missouri, of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, which is being investigated by the U.S. Justice Department and has focused national attention on the use of deadly force by police. Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine appointed Piepmeier as a special prosecutor in the case to look into whether the shooting was justified. The nine-member grand jury decided against indicting the Beavercreek officers on murder, reckless homicide or negligent homicide charges after hearing testimony from 18 witnesses and listening to and viewing hours of audio and video recordings of the incident, Piepmeier said.   A surveillance video released on Wednesday, aired on local television, showed Crawford picked up a BB gun off a shelf and strolled through the store with it until police shot him.  Michael Wright, an attorney representing Crawford’s family, was not immediately available for comment.  Officials in Beavercreek have asked the FBI to review the case to see whether Crawford’s civil rights were violated. Ohio Governor John Kasich and Attorney General DeWine called on the U.S. Justice Department to review the case. “This is a tragedy for the Crawford family and I share the concern of many in the community that this matter must be handled with the utmost seriousness and respect,” Kasich said.

520,TGT,Federal investigators to review Ohio Walmart shooting,"(Reuters) - Federal investigators will review whether two white police officers violated the civil rights of a black man they fatally shot while he held a BB gun in a Dayton-area Walmart in August, the U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday.   The announcement came hours after an Ohio grand jury decided not to press charges against two white Beavercreek police officers who fatally shot John Crawford III, 22, while he held a pellet gun in the store on Aug. 5.  The Justice Department and FBI “will conduct a thorough and independent review of the evidence and take appropriate action if the evidence indicates a prosecutable violation of federal criminal civil rights statutes,” a statement said.

521,TGT,"EBay, Wal-Mart warnings stir holiday sales concerns","SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - EBay Inc on Wednesday joined Wal-Mart Stores Inc in cutting its outlook for the all-important holiday season, suggesting that the fourth quarter may turn out to be weaker than some analysts predicted as recently as last week. The warnings from two of the retail industry’s most influential players comes as investors re-assess the state of the global economy after weak data this week from the two largest countries, the United States and China. EBay and Wal-Mart blamed divergent factors such as food stamp reductions and unfavorable search-engine optimization for the lower outlooks. Both complained about the stronger dollar putting the skids on their forecasts, lowering the value of overseas sales once converted into the U.S. currency. But analysts say stagnant incomes are also prompting U.S. consumers to curtail spending. “EBay, especially on the marketplaces side, is actually suffering from company-specific setbacks,” Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria said. “But overall, if e-commerce was growing faster or as fast as it was last year or a couple years ago, it would have probably helped them hide that.” EBay’s fourth-quarter outlook was undercut by the strength of the dollar against the British pound, the euro and the Australian dollar, which together account for 35 percent of eBay’s volume. The stronger dollar alone forced eBay to cut its fourth-quarter revenue outlook by $120 million. Coupled with slower-than-expected growth in its marketplaces division, eBay was forced to lop off $300 million from its annual revenue forecast. “As expected, (retail) sales have accelerated in the second half of the year, though economic signals remain mixed and consumers are still facing headwinds such as weak income growth,” Moody’s analyst Michael Zuccaro wrote on Wednesday. The more measured tone may spook investors as retailers such as Amazon.com Inc and Target release results over the next month. Investors and analysts had expressed high hopes for the holiday season as recently as last week. The National Retail Federation, in a press release entitled “optimism shines,” predicted strengthening consumer confidence would trigger a 4.1 percent spike in November-December retail sales, outpacing the 3.1 percent seen in the same period of 2013. But the group also warned that consumers remained uneasy about economic conditions, echoing concerns from other analysts including those at Moody’s. Two-thirds of Americans are limiting how much they spend each month, according to a Bankrate.com report released this week. The top reason was stagnant incomes. eBay Chief Executive John Donahoe told Reuters he was “cautiously optimistic” about the holiday season but declined to discuss the topic further. In a sign of its cautious view on the U.S. market, Wal-Mart said it would slow store openings in the next fiscal year. Wal-Mart, which recorded $473.1 billion in sales in its last fiscal year, said it now expects sales to rise 2-3 percent in the current year to Jan. 31, 2015. It had previously estimated growth at the low end of a 3-5 percent range. Lower gasoline prices had been expected to fuel higher retail sales this winter, especially at Wal-Mart and other chains that cater to low- to middle-income shoppers, analysts said.

522,TGT,U.S. lawmaker seeks information from CEOs on cyber attacks,"WASHINGTON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - A senior Democratic lawmaker on Wednesday asked the chief executives of five companies, including Home Depot Inc, Target Corp and Kmart , to share more information about recent cyber attacks on their companies. U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said he was concerned about the rising number of cyber intrusions and media reports that they originate from overseas. “The increased frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks on both public and private entities highlights the need for greater collaboration to improve data security,” Cummings wrote in the letter, which was distributed to journalists. “Your company’s knowledge, information and experience with this recent data breach will be helpful as Congress examines federal cybersecurity laws and any necessary improvements to protect sensitive consumer and government financial information.” A Home Depot spokesman said the company will continue to cooperate with lawmakers and others. He declined to provide details. Cummings’ letter also went to Community Health Systems  and the parent company of US Investigations Services,  USIS, a firm that performs background checks on U.S. government employees. USIS was victim of a breach that compromised data of at least 25,000 workers, including some undercover investigators. Cyber attacks on retail outlets, such as Home Depot and Target, have affected tens of millions of American customers. Other widespread breaches include Michaels Stores Inc  and Neiman Marcus. Cummings sent a similar letter to the postmaster general on Monday after the U.S. Postal Service revealed it was the victim of a cyber attack that may have compromised the personal information of more than 800,000 employees, as well as data on customers who contacted its call center this year.

The Fed is set to publish minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s October policy meeting at 2:00 p.m. EST (1900 GMT). They are expected to show the Fed’s path is diverging from other major central banks that are increasing their stimulus programs. This view has helped strengthen the U.S. dollar, weighing on crude oil and other commodity prices. “I can understand the market being a bit jittery here after making a new high and pausing ahead of the Fed minutes,” said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer of Multi-Asset Strategies and Solutions at Voya Investment Management. Starts for U.S. single-family homes rose for a second straight month in October and overall building permits approached a 6-1/2-year high, suggesting the housing market was still on a recovery path. “Data was good today so it’s hard to find a reason (for the slight decline in stocks) in the data,” Zemsky said. At 10:23 a.m. EST (1523 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average fell 40.71 points, or 0.23 percent, to 17,647.11, the S&P; 500 lost 7.6 points, or 0.37 percent, to 2,044.2 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 29.89 points, or 0.64 percent, to 4,672.55. Staples rose 9.9 percent to $14.02 as the largest gainer on the S&P; 500 after it reported higher-than-expected quarterly sales and profit as demand recovered for core office supplies. Target Corp rose 5.3 percent to $71.10 and Lowe’s  rose 5.9 percent to $61.98, both after reporting results. Cliffs Natural Resources said it was looking to exit its Eastern Canadian iron ore operations, which may result in the closure of its Bloom Lake mine in Quebec. Its shares fell 13.7 percent to $8.81. Shares of Vipshop fell 10 percent to $21.32 after the Chinese online discount retailer’s sales forecast failed to beat estimates for the first time this fiscal year. Oplink Communications shares jumped 13.8 percent to $24.18. It is being purchased by Koch Optics, a subsidiary of privately-help Koch Industries, for about $445 million. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE 1,887 to 912, for a 2.07-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,769 issues fell and 647 advanced for a 2.73-to-1 ratio. The S&P; 500 was posting 18 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 30 new highs and 38 new lows.

533,TGT,Target fails to end banks' lawsuit over data breach,"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday rejected Target Corp’s bid to dismiss a lawsuit by banks seeking to recoup money they spent reimbursing fraudulent charges and issuing new credit and debit cards because of the retailer’s late 2013 data breach. U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson in St. Paul, Minnesota said Target played a “key role” in allowing hackers to infiltrate its computer systems. He said this justified letting the five bank plaintiffs, which seek class-action status on behalf of lenders nationwide, pursue much of their lawsuit accusing the second-largest U.S. discount retailer of negligence and violating Minnesota consumer protection laws. The banks are seeking millions of dollars in damages. “Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that Target’s actions and inactions - disabling certain security features and failing to heed the warning signs as the hackers’ attack began - caused foreseeable harm to plaintiffs,” Magnuson wrote. “Plaintiffs have also plausibly alleged that Target’s conduct both caused and exacerbated the harm they suffered.” Target did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has said at least 40 million credit cards were compromised in the breach, and that as many as 110 million people may have had personal information, such as email addresses and phone numbers, stolen. Target has also said the bank plaintiffs were “sophisticated parties” that lacked the close ties to the retailer necessary to support their legal claims. The plaintiffs include Umpqua Holdings Corp’s  Umpqua Bank in Roseburg, Oregon; Mutual Bank in Whitman, Massachusetts; Village Bank in St. Francis, Minnesota; CSE Federal Credit Union in Lake Charles, Louisiana; and First Federal Savings of Lorain in Lorain, Ohio. They are seeking class-action status on behalf of banks and credit unions with customers who used credit and debit cards at Target between Nov. 1 and Dec. 19, 2013. Consumers are also pursuing related class-action litigation over the breach, and Target has asked Magnuson to throw out that case.

536,TGT,Preview: Georgia Tech at Dayton,"Brian Gregory coached at Dayton for eight seasons before leaving for Georgia Tech in 2011, so naturally there was emotion on both sides when the Flyers came to Atlanta and defeated the Yellow Jackets 82-72 last season. Those emotions figure to tug harder at Gregory on Tuesday when Dayton hosts Georgia Tech, marking Gregory’s first game at UD Arena since his eight years leading the Flyers. Both teams are hot: the Flyers have won six of seven while the Yellow Jackets are 5-1 in their past six contests. Dayton’s run has not come without internal trouble as leading rebounder Devon Scott and Jalen Robinson were dismissed from the team Wednesday. The Flyers did not miss either player in Saturday’s 78-62 victory over Boston, getting career-high 19-point performances from Kendall Pollard and Darrell Davis. The Yellow Jackets, who topped Vanderbilt 65-60 on Saturday, rode another strong performance from forward Charles Mitchell (19 points, eight rebounds). TV: 8 p.m. ET, CBS Sports Network ABOUT GEORGIA TECH (8-2): Frontcourt players Mitchell, Demarco Cox and Robert Sampson – all newcomers who transferred to Georgia Tech – have helped the Yellow Jackets out-rebound opponents by 10.7 boards per game, seventh-best in the nation. Mitchell averages 10.5 points and 7.3 rebounds, while Cox has six double-figure scoring games and Sampson averages 6.3 boards in only 20.8 minutes per game. Marcus Georges-Hunt is 4-of-22 from 3-point range after shooting 34.1 percent from beyond the arc last season, but is leading the Yellow Jackets in scoring at 11.7 points. ABOUT DAYTON (8-2): The Flyers come in after their best shooting game of the season, setting highs for field-goal percentage (52) and made 3-pointers (11). Senior guard Jordan Sibert has scored in double figures eight games in a row, leading the team in scoring at 14.4 points and getting a much help Saturday from Pollard (7-of-13 from the field) and Davis (5-of-5 from 3-point range). Dayton ranks third in the Atlantic 10 defensively, allowing 58.3 points per contest. TIP-INS 1. Georgia Tech has never beaten Dayton in three tries, losing in the 2009 Puerto Rico Tip-Off (coached by Gregory) and in 1977. 2. Pollard has led the Flyers in scoring in three of the past five contests. 3. The Yellow Jackets are 19th nationally in offensive rebounds per game (14.6).

Sibert went 3-of-7 from 3-point range and Dyshawn Pierre hit all four of his 3-point attempts en route to a season-best 19 points for Dayton (9-2). The Flyers used a 19-5 run in the second half to establish a comfortable cushion, and finished 10-of-18 from 3-point range and 23-of-31 from the free-throw line while committing just six turnovers. Marcus Georges-Hunt led the Yellow Jackets (8-3) with 13 points, who unlike Dayton, struggled from 3-point range in shooting 4-of-20. Tadric Jackson added 12 points and Charles Mitchell finished with 10 points and 10 rebounds as Georgia Tech outrebounded the Flyers 39-27. Georgia Tech trailed for most of the first half and was down 39-33 at intermission, but Quinton Stephens’ 3-pointer pulled the Yellow Jackets within 39-38 early in the second half before the Flyers pulled away. While Georgia Tech scored just five points in the next 11:45, Sibert hit a pair of 3-pointers and Pierre’s 3-pointer with just under eight minutes left established a 58-43 Dayton advantage. The Flyers hit 7-of-10 3-point attempts in the first half, Pierre hitting two in a row to put Dayton ahead 11-10 and sparking a 21-9 run that saw Sibert score six points and Darrell Davis add a pair from long range, the second giving Dayton a 26-17 advantage.

538,TGT,In-store pickup does not save U.S. shoppers much time: study,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Major U.S. retailers including Target Corp and Toys ‘R Us have begun allowing shoppers to collect online purchases at their brick-and-mortar stores, but a study shows the option often saves little, if any, time over in-store shopping.  According to a small study to be released on Tuesday by retail-intelligence firm StellaService, in-store pickup saved shoppers just 96 seconds on average compared with searching for items on their own. In a few cases, in-store pickup took longer. In-store pickup is one of many services being tested as retailers try to use their stores as mini-shipping hubs to get items to shoppers more quickly. It comes in response to competition from the No. 1 U.S. online retailer, Amazon.com Inc, which has streamlined its delivery service. The StellaService study, based on 44 visits to stores in the South run by 11 retailers, is one of the most comprehensive studies so far of the in-store pickup service. The results show that retailers have no uniform approach to the issue.  “It’s amazing just how much simpler the process would have been if someone had just put up a sign,” said Ty McMahan, senior director of content for StellaService, adding that retailers are spending “tens of millions of dollars” on these initiatives. Shoppers spent an average of 5 minutes and 24 seconds in a store when trying to pick up their online orders. Those who did not use the in-store pickup feature spent an average of 7 minutes in the store, according to the study. But in-store pickup saved just 30 seconds at Target and Toys ‘R Us. At Macy’s Inc, StellaService shoppers were not quite sure where to go. In-store pickup took 8 minutes and 30 seconds, while those who walked in spent 5 minutes at a Macy’s store.  By contrast, in-store pickup took only 2 minutes at Office Depot Inc, compared with 4 minutes for those who walked in. Home Depot Inc and Nordstrom Inc were the only other retailers that were slower at in-store pickup. Macy’s and Home Depot could not be immediately reached for comment. Nordstrom said one of the reasons they offer in-store pickup for online items is to guarantee customers that it will be there for them if they make a visit to the store. “We are always looking at ways to improve the service for our customers,” Nordstrom spokeswoman Brooke White said.

Dollar Tree, which had 5,282 stores in the United States and Canada as of Nov. 1, said it would likely sign an agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission by the end of the month on the number of stores it would have to give up. Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp could be among potential buyers as they seek to expand their small-format stores, said Rahul Sharma, managing director of investment advisory firm Neev Capital. Family Dollar has agreed to be bought by its smaller rival for $8.5 billion in cash and stock, rejecting a sweetened hostile $9.1 billion offer from Dollar General Corp. Family Dollar shareholders on Dec. 23 adjourned voting on the Dollar Tree offer, indicating interest in the higher offer despite its risk. Family Dollar on Monday asked its shareholders to vote for the Dollar Tree offer at a Jan. 22 shareholder meeting. “After two delays, we have been more than reasonable but have reached the end of our patience,” Dollar Tree Chief Executive Bob Sasser said in a letter to Family Dollar. Dollar General has said that it was willing to divest up to 1,500 stores to satisfy FTC concerns but Family Dollar said Monday that offer could fall short. Family Dollar warned on Monday that regulators will want many more than 1,500 stores divested, saying that the FTC, which is looking at both possible deals to ensure they comply with antitrust law, identified a long list of what it called “problematic stores” if Dollar General prevails. “We estimate based on experience with earlier iterations of the FTC staff’s store lists that the current count of stores that the FTC staff views as presumptively problematic is around 3,500 to 4,000 stores,” Family Dollar said in a letter to shareholders. Dollar General will provide an update before the vote, a spokeswoman said. “I think more people are going to be leaning toward Dollar Tree after today,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said.

543,TGT,UPDATE 2-Obama seeks enhanced cybersecurity laws to fight hackers,"(Recasts with announcement, reactions, Treasury comment on North Korea sanctions) By Roberta Rampton and Alina Selyukh WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Tuesday renewed a push to beef up U.S. cybersecurity laws after recent headline-grabbing hacking attacks against companies like Sony Pictures, Home Depot and Target. During a tour of a “war room” at the Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity nerve center, Obama said the recent attacks have highlighted the threat faced by financial systems, power grids and healthcare systems that run on networks connected to the Internet. “We’ve got to stay ahead of those who would do us harm. The problem is that government and the private sector are still not always working as closely together as we should,” Obama said. Congress has tried and failed for years to pass legislation to encourage companies to share data from attacks with the government, and each other, but grappled with liability issues raised by companies and privacy concerns from civil liberties groups. But Obama proposed legislation, due to be sent to Congress on Tuesday, that seeks a balance. It would offer liability protection to companies that provide information in near-real-time to the government, but require them to strip it of any personal data. Obama has elevated cybersecurity to the top of his 2015 agenda, seeing it as an area where cooperation is possible with the Republican-led Congress. He discussed the legislation on Tuesday with House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and said they agreed cybersecurity needs to be addressed. The White House will also build momentum for the legislative move at a cybersecurity summit slated for Feb. 13 in Silicon Valley, at Stanford University. “Foreign governments, criminals and hackers probe America’s computer networks every single day. We saw that again in the attack on Sony,” Obama said. Obama has blamed the Sony hack on North Korea. A top Treasury Department sanctions official told lawmakers at a hearing on Tuesday the agency was looking at more ways to cut the country off from international financial systems. On Monday, people claiming to be allied with Islamic State militants hacked social media accounts for the U.S. military command that oversees operations in the Middle East. The attack is still under investigation but did not seem to have affected classified information, Obama said. U.S. cyber officials and companies have for years urged Congress to codify how they can best exchange information to respond to hacking attacks. Obama proposed legislation in 2011 that fizzled in Congress. His revised plan seeks to address corporate concerns that companies get immunity against government and private lawsuits based on cyber threat-related data shared with federal authorities. Privacy advocates applauded the proposal to require companies to strip private information from the data they share, and cautiously welcomed a call for new privacy rules that will determine how federal agencies are allowed to use and store the data. “It is a thoughtful proposal but ... there are still many gaps that need to be filled,” said Harley Geiger, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology. Privacy advocates remain concerned about the access that intelligence agencies may have to the information companies share with the Department of Homeland Security, following last year’s disclosures about the scope of U.S. surveillance programs by former contractor Edward Snowden. Obama also proposed to give law enforcement agencies broader power to investigate and prosecute cybercrime, hoping to deter the sale of spyware and theft of personal data. His proposal would make selling stolen credit card information overseas a crime and would allow authorities to prosecute the sale of botnets, computer networks linked to cybercrime. He also wants to require companies to tell consumers within 30 days from the discovery of a data breach that their personal information has been compromised.

544,TGT,UPDATE 3-Obama seeks enhanced cybersecurity laws to fight hackers,"(Adds legislation moving to Capitol Hill) By Roberta Rampton and Alina Selyukh WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama sent a bill to Congress on Tuesday to strengthen U.S. cybersecurity laws to protect government, businesses and consumers while protecting privacy, after recent hacking attacks against Sony Pictures, Home Depot Inc and Target Corp , and on Monday the federal government itself. “We’ve got to stay ahead of those who would do us harm. The problem is that government and the private sector are still not always working as closely together as we should,” Obama said. During a tour of a “war room” at the Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity nerve center, Obama said the attacks highlighted the threat to financial systems, power grids and healthcare systems that run on networks connected to the Internet. Congress has tried for years to pass legislation to encourage companies to share data from cyberattacks with the government and each other. Liability issues raised by companies and privacy concerns of civil liberties groups contributed to the failure to implement such laws. Obama’s proposed legislation looks to balance needs with concerns by offering liability protection to companies that provide information in near-real-time to the government, while requiring them to strip it of any personal data. On Monday, the Twitter and YouTube accounts of the U.S. military command that oversees operations in the Middle East were hacked by people claiming to be sympathetic toward the Islamic State militant group being targeted in American bombing raids. Obama said the attack, which is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, did not seem to affect  classified information. Obama has moved cybersecurity to the top of his 2015 agenda, seeing it as an area where cooperation is possible with the Republican-led Congress. He discussed the legislation on Tuesday with House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and said they agreed cybersecurity needed to be addressed. Reaction from other congressional leaders was also positive. The leading Republicans and Democrats on the Senate and House Homeland Security committees said in a joint statement that Obama’s proposal would be useful. The White House will also try to build support for the legislation at a cybersecurity summit scheduled for Feb. 13 at Stanford University. Obama proposed legislation in 2011 that died in Congress. “Foreign governments, criminals and hackers probe America’s computer networks every single day. We saw that again in the attack on Sony,” Obama said. The United States has blamed that hacking on North Korea Privacy advocates applauded the proposal to require companies to strip private information from data they share, and cautiously welcomed a call for new privacy rules that would  determine how federal agencies are allowed to use and store such  data. “It is a thoughtful proposal but ... there are still many gaps that need to be filled,” said Harley Geiger, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology. Privacy advocates remained concerned about the access intelligence agencies may have to the information companies share with the Department of Homeland Security. Obama’s proposal would give law enforcement agencies broader power to investigate and prosecute cybercrime, with an eye on deterring the theft of personal data. And it would make selling stolen credit card information overseas a crime and would allow authorities to prosecute the sale of botnets, computer networks linked to cybercrime.

545,TGT,"In surprise move, Target exits Canada and takes $5.4 billion loss","TORONTO (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) will exit the Canadian market after less than two years in a surprise retreat that will throw more than 17,000 employees out of work and trigger a $5.4 billion quarterly loss.  Shares of the U.S. discount retailer, which was granted creditor protection for its money-losing Canadian subsidiary, at one point rose more than 4 percent on the move. The stock was up 2.2 percent at $75.94 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The company announced on Thursday it is shutting all of its 133 Canadian stores and said it expects to report about $5.4 billion in pretax losses for its fourth quarter, which finishes at the end of January. Losses are mostly due to the writedown of the Canadian investment, along with exit costs and operating losses. Minneapolis-based Target, the No. 2 discount chain in the United States, has struggled in Canada since its March 2013 launch. It faced huge supply chain problems due to a myriad of problems at its warehouses, poor communication with headquarters and the use of inexperienced staff. That left stores poorly stocked and selection limited, disappointing shoppers who had eagerly anticipated its arrival in a market where the discount space was long dominated by Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N). Target had said in November it would review the future of the Canadian business after the holiday season. Stores checked by Reuters in Vancouver, Toronto and Ottawa around Christmas showed only moderate traffic and Chief Executive Brian Cornell said he didn’t see the “step-change” in performance required to justify staying the course. No matter how Target crunched the numbers it could not envision making profits until 2021, Cornell said. He told a conference call the company was “facing a decision to devote billions of dollars of additional resources for the Canadian segment without the realistic prospect of an appropriate return.” The move surprised some analysts who had expected Target to close its weakest stores and try to fix the rest. Before Thursday’s decision Target had sunk roughly $6 billion into the market, including around $2.5 billion in capital expenditure and $1.7 billion of losses to-date, Fitch Ratings said.  “Anything you could have gotten wrong in the playbook, they got wrong,” said Antony Karabus, CEO of retail consultant firm HRC Advisory. Target said exiting Canada would allow it to focus resources on the U.S. market, where it is recovering from a massive data breach during the holiday quarter of 2013. Target said comparable U.S. sales during the fourth quarter would likely rise 3 percent, up from its 2 percent forecast. It also raised its estimate for adjusted earnings per share in the quarter to $1.43 to $1.47, an upward revision of 6 cents. Expectations Canadian retailers would benefit from the pullout helped lift their shares, with Canadian Tire (CTCa.TO) up more than 5 percent at one point, and grocers Loblaw (L.TO) and Empire Co (EMPa.TO) both up about 2 percent. Wal-Mart is also seen as a beneficiary and could look to pick up some of the abandoned locations, analysts said. Target said it would look to grow in the United States by expanding its smaller format stores, including those in big cities. But the failure in Canada raises serious doubts about the retailer’s long-term growth prospects, said Jim Danahy, director of the Centre for Retail Leadership at York University’s Schulich School of Business in Toronto. “There isn’t a bigger implosion and it needs to be really understood this is entirely their fault,” Danahy said. Target had hired Eleven Points Logistics, a subsidiary of Pittsburgh-based Genco, to run its Canadian warehouses. The company had also reached a long-term wholesale agreement with Empire Co’s Sobeys to supply it with groceries in Canada. A spokesman for Sobeys said the loss of the account would not have a material impact on its results. Genco could not immediately be reached for comment. Former Target and Eleven Points employees had told Reuters about a laundry list of problems at the warehouses, stores, and headquarters, especially in the first year. They said a combination of new technology and systems, inexperienced hires and poor training all contributed to supply chain woes. Barcodes on many items did not match what was in the computer system, they said, causing massive warehouse logjams, while store backrooms were stacked from “floor to rafters”, making it difficult to locate products to put on shelves. Target said stores would remain open during liquidation, and that with court approval it would pay all of its Canadian employees a minimum of 16 weeks of compensation.

546,TGT,"After Canada exit, Target thinks small with U.S. expansion plans","(Reuters) - Target Corp’s exit from Canada means Chief Executive Brian Cornell will have to rely solely on the saturated U.S. market for growth, the success of which could hinge on a shift toward smaller and urban-based stores. Target announced plans on Thursday to close all of its 133 stores in Canada and put the local business in bankruptcy. With no other market outside the United States seen as a good fit for Target, the move effectively puts an end to its international ambitions, analysts said.  The Minneapolis-based retailer said the move would free up funds to put toward bolstering its U.S. operations. Target operates 1,801 stores in the U.S., the bulk of which are large-format locations averaging 135,000 square feet.  Cornell also told a conference call he planned to accelerate the expansion of its CityTarget locations, which are based in big cities and range from 80,000 to 160,000 square feet, and a convenience store-like format called Express. While Cornell did not disclose a numerical target for that expansion, some analysts said these smaller formats offered Target the largest potential growth, partly because they are targeting urban areas not yet exposed to Target stores. “They could easily open in the range of 500 to 600 smaller format stores across the country,” said Craig Johnson, head of retail consultancy Customer Growth Partners. He said, however, that it could take a few years before Target “got the formula right.” In focusing on smaller and urban-based stores, Target is taking a page out of the playbook of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The largest U.S. retailer is planning to open 180 to 200 Neighborhood Market stores this year, making the more compact format a key pillar of its growth plans. Target launched the first CityTarget in 2012 and currently has eight of the stores with plans to open one in Boston this year, its first on the East Coast. It has only one Express, a 20,000-square-foot store opened in Minneapolis last year. Given the focus on smaller stores, Fitch Ratings analyst Phil Zahn said he was expecting Target’s square footage to grow by only about 1 percent annually for the foreseeable future.  “You have to build a lot of the small stores to move the needle,” Zahn said, adding that he was skeptical of the prospects for expansion outside the United States. “If they are trying to carve out a discounter niche it may not fit in Mexico or other emerging markets. So I have a feeling that is a ways down the road.” ",1152015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-target-canada-usa/after-canada-exit-target-thinks-small-with-u-s-expansion-plans-idUSKBN0KO2Q820150115

549,TGT,Target's exit from Canada to pressure commercial property market,"TORONTO/MONTREAL, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Target Corp’s  abrupt decision to withdraw from Canada is troubling news for many mall owners, as the most obvious potential buyer of property assets - Wal-Mart - is expected to cherry-pick from Target’s 133 locations. Minneapolis-based Target, the second-biggest U.S. discounter, obtained creditor protection for the Canadian unit and said on Thursday it will seek to sell real estate assets, including leases for some 14.7 million square feet of retail space. “There’s going to be a spike in vacancy rates - there’s no question,” said David Bell, a senior retail consultant with Colliers International, noting the impact will also affect smaller tenants within malls. “You’re probably going to see some mall managers move tenants around, pretty quickly. This is going to be, ‘Let’s get the war map on the wall.’” Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world’s biggest retailer, already has stores near most Target locations, said Jim Danahy, chief executive of consultancy CustomerLAB. He said any big buy-out deal could raise competition concerns with regulators. Target’s retreat also means retailers are more likely to take a measured approach to Canadian expansion, rather than emulate the large-scale push that failed the U.S. discounter. One Canadian mall owner, who has Target stores in his shopping centers, said the company’s departure leaves him with two choices. “One, you need to see if a large retailer like Wal-Mart will come in and take up the space. Or you need to break up the space to attract tenants,” said the owner, who did not want to be named. “It will have a dramatic impact on shopping centers. There are going to be some victims, where the space just stays empty.” Property owners may need to get more creative in filling mall space with nontraditional tenants like data centers or medical offices, experts said. Prime urban malls, in which Target was one of several anchors, are expected to quickly find suitors, but smaller, suburban malls, with only one or two anchors, will be a tougher sell. Craig Johnson, head of Customer Growth Partners, said he expects British budget clothing retailer Primark Stores Ltd, which recently signed a deal to lease space from Sears Holdings  Corp to expand in the U.S. market, to take a look at the Target locations. Primark is controlled by Canada’s Weston family, who also control grocer Loblaw Companies Ltd. “Primark is a value-oriented department store and there is nothing really like it in the U.S. now and there is nothing really like it up in Canada. Canadians are even thriftier than Americans,” Johnson said. Credit Suisse analyst David Hartley believes that Target’s top locations will likely lure Wal-Mart along with grocers, department stores such as U.S.-based Marshalls, Canada’s Hudson’s Bay Co and specialty auto and home goods retailer Canadian Tire Corp. Antony Karabus, CEO of retail advisory firm HRC Advisory, sees a fit with home goods retailers such as Home Depot Inc , Rona Inc and Lowe’s Companies Inc ; along with such large grocers as Loblaw, Sobeys and Metro Inc. He expects Target to sell half its locations without “a lot of pain,” but the remainder will cause “heartache.” Real estate investment trusts with exposure to Target locations include RioCan and Morguard,  though prices of units in both were little-changed. RioCan said Target accounts for less than 2 percent of its rental revenue and its leases for 26 locations are guaranteed by the parent company for more than a decade.

555,TGT,Thin crowds during CEO's visit helped seal Target Canada's demise,"NEW YORK/TORONTO (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) was scrambling for ways to fix its failing Canadian expansion and considering closing just the weakest locations, but a pre-holiday visit to several stores by CEO Brian Cornell helped seal the decision for a full retreat. Cornell spent the weekend before Christmas making solo visits to stores in Ontario and Quebec, Canada’s most populous provinces, according to a Target source familiar with the U.S. discount retailer’s decision to pull out of Canada. Though the recently appointed chief executive could see signs of operational improvements - notably, better stocked shelves - a key ingredient was missing. “There just weren’t enough people in the stores,” the source said. “The weekend before Christmas our stores are usually packed. He wasn’t seeing enough people. The stores he visited had never looked better, they were in stock, but there weren’t enough people there.” Target said on Thursday it will exit the Canadian market after less than two years, closing 133 stores, throwing more than 17,000 employees out of work, and leaving billions in losses. A former Target employee in touch with vendors and existing staff at the Canadian headquarters said everyone was blind-sided by the decision, especially by the timing.    Target, which entered Canada hoping it would be profitable after the first year, had invested more than C$7 billion ($5.84 billion) in its Canadian expansion since the start of 2011, according to its Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) filing.  But it wildly overestimated how readily Canadians would embrace its arrival. A laundry list of missteps at all levels of the operation left shoppers disenchanted.  The filing showed the company’s struggle to lure shoppers resulted in losses of between $169 million and $329 million every quarter since it opened. Target is projecting a cumulative operating loss of more than C$2.5 billion pretax, more than triple what they originally expected. Target blamed its colossal failure on four key factors: its large-scale opening, supply chain problems, pricing and product assortment issues, and a lack of online presence.  In the filing, Target said pace and large size of the expansion severely hampered its ability to respond quickly and effectively to problems.  The company had invested heavily in its supply chain operations, but a combination of data-entry and ordering errors, poor training, and confusion over differences between U.S. and Canadian systems resulted in empty shelves for key merchandise and over-stocking of other products.  The Minneapolis-based retailer considered all options as it struggled to right the floundering Canadian rollout, adding resources and consulting extensively since last spring.  It considered selling assets and consolidating distribution operations, but “even under the most optimistic scenarios,” Target said in the filing that it could not see a way to break-even in the next five years. On Wednesday, the Target board gathered for a regularly scheduled meeting, according the unnamed source. Members knew that they would be evaluating Canada’s holiday performance, and that modeling was under way to determine what it would take to make the operation profitable. The source said executives had weighed several scenarios, including shutting dozens of poorly performing stores and trying to save the profitable ones. Instead, a full pullout was announced, and Target Canada filed for bankruptcy protection. On Friday, as retail analysts and the Canadian media tore into Target for mishandling the expansion, Cornell called an all-staff meeting at Target’s Minneapolis headquarters to explain what had gone wrong. Taking to the podium in a massive meeting room emptied of furniture to accommodate hundreds of staffers, Cornell spoke for 15 minutes. Exiting Canada “was the hardest business decision I’ve ever made,” Cornell told the team, according to the source. He said the focus would now be on digital and U.S. operations.

557,TGT,UPDATE 1-Target replaces cybersecurity chief with Tesco veteran,"(Recasts first paragraph, adds spokeswoman comment on DeRodes departure) Feb 3 (Reuters) - Target Corp on Tuesday named former Tesco PLC executive Mike McNamara as chief information officer to replace Bob DeRodes, who was hired in May to bolster the retailer’s cybersecurity following a massive data breach in late 2013. When Target named DeRodes as CIO in April it had been looking for someone to fill that role on an interim basis, Target spokeswoman Katie Boylan said, noting he will stay on as an advisor for a short time before retiring. DeRodes declined to be interviewed, Boylan said. Former Tesco CIO McNamara, who had been with the company for 15 years, played a key role in modernizing the British supply chain and establishing it as one of the world’s largest online grocers, Target said in a statement. “Technology is critical for Target’s future success. So finding the right leader for this role was one of my absolute top priorities,” Brian Cornell, who was named chief executive in July, said in the statement. Target said DeRodes had played a key role in bolstering the company’s cybersecurity in the wake of the 2013 breach that compromised up to 70 million customers’ personal data and eventually led to the departure of former CEO Gregg Steinhafel. DeRodes hired Brad Maiorino, a former General Motors Co  executive, as the company’s first chief information security officer in June. Both Maiorino and Jacqueline Hourigan, the chief compliance officer named in November, will work closely with McNamara on a variety of issues, Boylan said.

562,TGT,"RPT-Wal-Mart wage hike seen pressuring Target, fast-food","(Repeats story with no change to text) By Nathan Layne Feb 19 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s wage hike will likely trigger a rethink on pay across the retail and fast-food sectors, with Target Corp one of the low-wage employers facing pressure to follow suit and pay workers more. Wal-Mart announced on Thursday it would lift its minimum U.S. wage to $9 an hour this year and $10 in 2016, raising the ante in a tightening labor market where low-skilled workers easily move between retailers and fast-food chains. Labor and shareholder activists will likely use the news to ratchet up pressure on companies which have so far faced less scrutiny than Wal-Mart, the largest private U.S. employer with a workforce of 1.3 million. “This is the largest retailer out there so I think others are going to have to follow,” said Brian Yarbrough, analyst at Edward Jones, naming Target and Staples Inc among other national retailers that may look to revise their pay scales. “All the restaurants are going to be under pressure as well.” When Gap Inc a year ago set its minimum wage at $9 an hour and pledged to go to $10 in 2015, many workers at Wal-Mart sought to switch and secure employment at the apparel retailer, according to Burt Flickinger, managing director of Strategic Resource Group, a retail industry consultancy. Now, Wal-Mart’s move should help it reduce turnover and will likely put the most direct pressure on Target, given that their pay scales for entry-level positions are generally close and there is broad overlap in product lines. “It’s absolutely Target,” Flickinger said when asked what rival would likely need to take action to retain staff. Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said the company was “committed to offering market competitive wages that can help attract and retain great talent.” She said Target pays above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 at all of its stores, but does not disclose its average rate. Wal-Mart said the hikes would lift the average hourly wage this year for full-time employees to $13 from $12.85, while raising the average for part-time staff to $10 from $9.48. Those rates could go higher in 2016. Data from employer review site Glassdoor based on at least 75 responses shows that Target, Wal-Mart and Staples are roughly paying the same hourly rate, with cashiers and sales associates making around $9 an hour. A cashier at McDonald’s Corp, by comparison, was averaging $8.44, the data shows. Staples and McDonald’s did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It’s not just wages. Wal-Mart also said it planned to make the scheduling of hours more predictable, taking a step towards addressing an issue that has long been a source of worker frustration. Labor groups and institutional investors have long targeted Wal-Mart on wages and now appear set to widen their scope. David Schilling, senior program director for human rights at the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, said investors would use the Wal-Mart wage hike as leverage when negotiating changes at other firms. “It’s not just the retail sector. It could be fast food, restaurant workers,” said Schilling.

565,TGT,Target halves order size for free shipping to $25,"(Reuters) - Target Corp halved the size of online orders eligible for free shipping to $25, undercutting Amazon.com Inc and traditional rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc as it focuses on its online business. Amazon offers free shipping on orders worth at least $35 and Walmart.com $50.  Target said on Monday the new threshold comes into effect immediately. Shipping has become a key promotional tool in the escalating war between retailers, with companies increasingly offering free shipping throughout the year instead of just during the holiday shopping season. Target’s digital offerings include Target.com and Cartwheel, a mobile app for coupons.  Brick-and-mortar retailers are moving into online retailing, offering additional benefits such as in-store pickups.  Online orders accounted for about 2.5 percent of total revenue of both Target and Wal-Mart in the year ended Jan. 31.  This translates into about $1.83 billion for Target, based on the average analyst estimate for its total revenue, way below the $12.2 billion Wal-Mart reported for the period.

569,TGT,UPDATE 2-Target beats and sales forecasts in sign strategy working,"(Adds CFO comments on investments, cost cuts, online business) Feb 25 (Reuters) - U.S. retailer Target Corp  reported a stronger-than-expected jump in fourth-quarter sales and profits and forecast modest growth this quarter in a sign that its online business strategy and focus on promoting select categories is working. The company said it had enjoyed strong sales of apparel and products for children and babies, a reflection of its move to expand a few product lines in which it believes it can outsell the competition on quality and price. Its online business contributed to a quarter of the growth in same-store sales, helped by waiving all shipping costs on orders during the Christmas holiday season. Similar to other retailers lower fuel prices also helped, Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan told a media call. Shares of Target were down 0.8 percent at $76.24. Target will announce investments in focus areas at an analyst meeting on Tuesday as well as cost cuts to fund them, Mulligan said. He did not say whether it may cut jobs. Target said comparable sales at stores open longer than a year rose 3.8 percent in the November-January quarter. That beat its forecast, unveiled just five weeks earlier when it announced an exit from the Canadian market, for a rise of 3 percent. “No one was more surprised than me,” Mulligan said. “Sales were incredibly strong in those last two weeks.” Target has gained back all of the customers lost in the wake of a damaging breach of consumer data that hurt sales during the holiday season in 2013 and then some, Mulligan said. He also pointed to a 3.2 percent rise in store traffic. Aiding the online business was the waiving of a $50 threshold on free shipping orders during the holidays. This week Target said it was halving that threshold to $25 in a bid to better compete with online leader Amazon.com and Wal-Mart Stores. Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes items including a $5.1 billion loss related to the Canada exit, came to $1.50 in the fourth quarter, the most important for retailers because it includes Christmas. That was above the $1.43 to $1.47 per share range forecast by the company last month. For the current quarter to end-April, Target forecast adjusted earnings per share of $0.95 to $1.05, up from $0.92 in the first quarter of 2014 and compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.04, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

573,TGT,UPDATE 2-Target to cut thousands of jobs as seeks to cut costs by $2 bln,"(Recasts lead, adds CEO comment, details, share price) March 3 (Reuters) - U.S. retailer Target Corp, which has been battling back after a massive data breach and sluggish performance, on Tuesday said it will eliminate several thousand jobs, mainly from headquarters locations in the United States and India, as it aims to cut $2 billion in costs over two years. The cost-cutting forms a key plank of a revival plan outlined by Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell, who has sought to narrow the retailer’s focus to a handful of product lines where Target believes it has an edge on quality and price while also investing to catch up with rivals online. Cornell said Target’s management needs streamlining and he wants to change the corporate culture from one focused on process to one that meets the demand of customers. Target said it was revamping its merchandise, in part to attract both millenials and Hispanics, seen as important to driving future sales growth. “We know that to compete today speed and simplicity are critically important,” Cornell told a meeting of analysts in New York. “Executing on this plan will translate to growth.” Target said the job cuts would primarily come from corporate locations in the Minneapolis area and in India that collectively employ about 26,000 people, and not from its roughly 1,800 stores across the United States. Target also said it would invest $1 billion in technology and to upgrade its supply chain. It expects profit margin, as measured by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, to hold steady at between 9.5 percent to 10 percent over the next five years, from 9.5 percent last year. Target’s shares closed up 32 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $78.00, after initially falling 2.2 percent after the company gave its outlook on Tuesday. Cornell, a former Wal-Mart Stores Inc and PepsiCo executive, has moved quickly since taking the helm in August in the wake of a massive breach of customer data in late 2013 that cost former CEO Gregg Steinhafel his job. His biggest decision to date, announced in January, was to pull out of the Canadian market, swallowing a $5.4 million loss. Cornel also halved the threshold on free shipping, undercutting Wal-Mart and others in the war for online customers, and is focusing investment on a handful of “signature” categories, including apparel, home goods and beauty products. On Tuesday Cornell outlined plans to improving Target’s offering of organic and other food offerings to boost its grocery business, which accounts for one-fifth of overall sales. For the current fiscal year ending January 2016, the company said it expected adjusted earnings per share, which excludes data breach costs and other expenses, of between $4.45 and $4.65, compared with the $4.27 per share it earned last year and the market consensus for $4.51, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It projected comparable sales growth of 1.5 to 2.5 percent this fiscal year and total sales growth of 2 to 3 percent. Some of the growth will come from smaller-sized stores. Of the 15 new stores Target plans to open this year, eight will be a convenience store format called Target Express, highlighting its push to capture demand in urban centers. The company also said it had the capacity to buy back up to $2 billion worth of its own shares this fiscal year, and looks to repurchase $3 billion annually from the following year and beyond.

Target said it was revamping its merchandise, in part to attract both millenials and Hispanics, seen as important to driving future sales growth. “We know that to compete today speed and simplicity are critically important,” Cornell told a meeting of analysts in New York. “Executing on this plan will translate to growth.” Target said the job cuts would primarily come from corporate locations in the Minneapolis area and in India that collectively employ about 26,000 people, and not from its roughly 1,800 stores across the United States. Target also said it would invest $1 billion in technology and to upgrade its supply chain. It expects profit margin, as measured by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, to hold steady at between 9.5 percent to 10 percent over the next five years, from 9.5 percent last year. Target’s shares closed up 32 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $78.00, after initially falling 2.2 percent after the company gave its outlook on Tuesday. Cornell, a former Wal-Mart Stores Inc and PepsiCo executive, has moved quickly since taking the helm in August in the wake of a massive breach of customer data in late 2013 that cost former CEO Gregg Steinhafel his job. His biggest decision to date, announced in January, was to pull out of the Canadian market, swallowing a $5.4 billion loss. Cornel also halved the threshold on free shipping, undercutting Wal-Mart and others in the war for online customers, and is focusing investment on a handful of “signature” categories, including apparel, home goods and beauty products. On Tuesday Cornell outlined plans to improving Target’s offering of organic and other food offerings to boost its grocery business, which accounts for one-fifth of overall sales. For the current fiscal year ending January 2016, the company said it expected adjusted earnings per share, which excludes data breach costs and other expenses, of between $4.45 and $4.65, compared with the $4.27 per share it earned last year and the market consensus for $4.51, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It projected comparable sales growth of 1.5 to 2.5 percent this fiscal year and total sales growth of 2 to 3 percent. Some of the growth will come from smaller-sized stores. Of the 15 new stores Target plans to open this year, eight will be a convenience store format called Target Express, highlighting its push to capture demand in urban centers. The company also said it had the capacity to buy back up to $2 billion worth of its own shares this fiscal year, and looks to repurchase $3 billion annually from the following year and beyond.

580,TGT,DuPont rejects activist request to change how directors are elected,"(Reuters) - DuPont DD.N on Tuesday rejected a push to let shareholders split their votes between company-backed directors and those nominated by activist investors in an escalating proxy battle with Nelson Peltz.  Peltz’s Trian Fund Management LP has been publicly critical of the company’s performance and requested DuPont use a tool called a universal proxy, which has played a key role in company shake-ups.  A traditional proxy uses white cards that contain the company-backed nominees or gold cards that list the shareholder nominees. The universal proxy allows shareholders to split their vote if they are not fully convinced of either party during a proxy battle. DuPont said a universal proxy could compromise access and accuracy and issuing the card to all 600,000 individual shareholders could be cumbersome. A date for the shareholder meeting has not been set. Last year it was April 23.         The universal card played a key role in billionaire activist investor William Ackman’s loss to Target Corp (TGT.N) in 2009 and his successful shakeup of Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd’s (CP.TO) board a few years later.    Peltz’s Trian said it was disappointed that DuPont chose to limit shareholder choice. DuPont said on Tuesday it had consulted with experts and believes the use of a traditional proxy card remains the most reliable and accurate process for electing directors.  The industrial conglomerate said the use of a universal proxy card would also not allow holders to sign and return voting forms without marking a preference. Trian, which owns a 2.68 percent stake in DuPont, has urged shareholders to vote for Peltz and three other nominees to the company’s board. DuPont has repeatedly snubbed Trian’s demand and instead named two of its own nominees as directors in February. Trian, which had previously called for a break-up of DuPont, said in February it was “open-minded” about keeping the company together, but criticized it for failing to meet earnings and revenue targets.

583,TGT,"Target to lift minimum wage to $9 an hour, matching rivals","(Reuters) - Target Corp next month will raise the minimum wage for all of its workers to $9 an hour, matching moves made by rivals including Wal-Mart Stores Inc and TJX Cos, a source familiar with the matter said. The move comes in the face of pressure from labor groups and allies calling for a “living wage” at retailers and fast-food companies across the country, as well as the lowest unemployment rate in more than six years. Target shares fell 1 percent in extended trade. The company has said it does not disclose wage levels. The clearest sign of the changing labor landscape came last month when Wal-Mart said it would move to the $9 minimum in April. Next year, employees with some six months training would be paid a minimum of $10 an hour. A week after Wal-Mart’s announcement, T.J. Maxx and Marshalls owner TJX said it would match the $9 minimum in June. Target Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan told analysts earlier this month that it was “not reasonable” to think in terms of a national minimum rate. Paying only $9 an hour in New York City or the oil-crazed economy of North Dakota would not attract any workers, he said. “Fixating on some single number to us, on an average number is unimportant. It’s about being competitive locally at a store level within a marketplace. That is important, and we’re going to be competitive,” he said. But pressure rose on Target, which is competing for employees with Wal-Mart. Women’s advocacy group UltraViolet, for instance, recently ran a Web ad campaign that targeted devices located near three Target stores. Banner ads read, “Did you know there’s a Walmart near you that pays higher minimum wage than Target?” Meanwhile, the U.S. unemployment rate has fallen to 5.5 percent. The Target wage raise, which was reported earlier by Dow Jones, will affect all 1,800 U.S. stores.

593,TGT,"After Target wage hike, labor groups turn to drugstore chains","CHICAGO, March 20 (Reuters) - Some labor groups looking to broaden their push for minimum wage hikes after success at big U.S. retailers including Target Corp, are preparing to take on drugstore chains. A source this week said Target will raise its minimum wage to $9 per hour in April, matching moves by rivals  Wal-Mart Stores Inc and TJX Cos. The retailers, which were targeted by labor advocates and their allies, are also facing tougher competition for employees as unemployment drops to its lowest level in more than six years. Labor activists said the wage hikes by big retailers will give them greater leverage with drugstore operators, who make up one of the fastest-growing and most profitable areas in retail. The United Food and Commercial Workers International (UFCW), a union which played a key role in pressuring Wal-Mart, said it will accelerate its efforts to organize Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc workers to demand better pay. Walgreens is the top U.S. drug retailer, followed by CVS Health Corp and Rite Aid Corp. “Given the current momentum, we expect a faster chance of success in hiking minimum wage within the retail space which includes drug chains, than say the fast food sector,” said Marc Goumbri, a spokesman for the UFCW. Another labor group, The New York-New Jersey Joint Board of Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), is planning to start wage negotiations this summer with the management of Duane Reade, a local subsidiary of Walgreens. “What jumps out at me is that drugstores are not only  reporting strong profits but expanding at a rapid pace and making multi-billion dollar acquisitions,” said the group’s President Julie Kelly. “That puts them in a position to lead here and raise the wages they pay,” said Kelly. The recent moves by large retailers raises the chances of success, she added. Kelly said her union has not decided on wage demands, although it broadly supports the $15 an hour “living wage” backed by labor groups nationwide. Twelve percent of Walgreens employees earn less than $9 an hour, with a typical cashier earning about $8.60 per hour, compared to $8.70 per hour at CVS Health Corp, according to compensation analytics firm Payscale.com, which usually collects pay data from a sample of a company’s employees. Walgreens spokesman Michael Polzin said the company meets or exceeds all wage ordinances and its pay scale varies as it seeks to remain competitive in local markets. He declined to comment on the prospect of wage hikes or the number of employees who earn less than $9. Payscale data showed 10 percent of CVS employees’ hourly earnings and 16 percent of Rite Aid Corp workers’ are below $9. CVS declined comment while Rite Aid did not respond to requests seeking comment. Drugstores are a good target in part because of relatively high employee retention rates, which make organizing easier than in other sectors, including fast food, analysts say. Annual worker turnover at fast food chains is as high as 50-100 percent in some areas, they said. Some analysts last year put the turnover at drugstore chains as low as 11 percent. With drugstores moving into 24 hour operations and employees demanding better benefits, the opportunity to organize the workforce has improved, said Burt Flickinger, managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group and a lecturer at Cornell University. Flickinger said even regional drugstore operators like Fred’s Pharmacy, part of discount retailer Fred’s Inc, New York- and Vermont-based chain Kinney Drugs could see their workers organize and press for higher wages. Another target could be Florida-based Navarro Discount Pharmacies Inc, which was acquired by CVS last year, he said. The companies did not respond to requests seeking comment. “It will take 6-8 months for the results to start coming in,” he said. “But drugstores most certainly appear to be the ones next in line for a wage hike.”   (Reporting by Nandita Bose in Chicago, editing by Peter Henderson and Christian Plumb)",3202015,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-drugstores-wages/after-target-wage-hike-labor-groups-turn-to-drugstore-chains-idUSL2N0WM1UJ20150320
594,TGT,Canada's TD Bank eyeing small acquisitions in U.S. market,"TORONTO, March 26 (Reuters) - Toronto-Dominion Bank  , Canada’s second-largest lender, said on Thursday it is open to doing small acquisitions in the U.S. market that would allow it to accelerate its branch rollout, especially in the southeastern part of the country. “We open about 25 to 30 new branches in the U.S. every year right through our footprint, so if there was a smallish tuck-in opportunity in the U.S. Southeast, we would certainly look at it seriously, because it would accelerate our store build-out by a few years,” said Chief Executive Bharat Masrani at a roundtable with media. TD, already one of the 10 largest banks in the United States with over 1,300 branches along the eastern coast stretching from Maine to Florida, sees no pressing need to do any transformative acquisitions at this time, said Masrani. “I’ve learned never to say never, but the great thing is we don’t need to do a big deal,” he said. “If something compelling comes up, we will certainly look at it, but we are not compelled to do it because there is a strategic gap in our franchise.” Masrani, who headed TD’s U.S. banking operations before taking over as CEO in November, said that TD remains an “organic growth type of institution,” but would look for other opportunities in the U.S. market too. “Given the type of balance sheet we have in the U.S., we are also highly liquid and are always looking at opportunities that would fill out our balance sheet because we are rich in deposits but not as rich in loans,” he said. As of Jan. 31, TD had $250 billion in assets in the U.S. and $204 billion in deposits, with a loan book of some $117 billion. Last month, TD extended its contract with discount retailer Target Corp, making it the exclusive issuer of Target co-branded and private label consumer credit cards to Target’s U.S. customers until March 2025.

595,TGT,UPDATE 2-GNC Holdings settles herbal supplements dispute with NY Attorney General,"* GNC starts selling herbal supplements in New York * NY AG test also confirms GNC’s products meet FDA guidelines * GNC agrees to tests that exceed FDA requirements * Probe into Walgreens, Wal-Mart, Target products ongoing * GNC shares up as much as 8 pct   (Adds Walgreens response in paragraph 13, updates share price) March 30 (Reuters) - GNC Holdings Inc said it restored certain herbal supplements to its stores in New York after reaching an agreement with the state’s attorney general that its products complied with the Food and Drug Administration’s guidelines. GNC also agreed to adopt testing standards for herbal supplements that exceed FDA requirements, a first in the United States, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement. The end of a dispute that started on Feb. 2 sent the company’s shares up as much as 8 percent to a 52-week high of $49.65 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. The company did not have to pay any monetary damages, just implement reforms, Elizabeth DeBold, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General’s office said. GNC was one of four retailers that halted sales of certain supplements after being subpoenaed by Schneiderman as DNA tests failed to detect plant materials that the companies claimed were a part of their supplements. Both internal and independent third-party tests had proved that GNC’s “products are safe, pure, properly labeled and in full compliance with all regulatory requirements”, the company said in a statement on Monday. GNC had said earlier that tests showed its products contained all herbal extracts listed on labels, and on Monday the company said it had restarted selling its Herbal Plus products. A study commissioned by the Attorney General to determine the presence or absence of the DNA of certain plants in some herbal supplements also found GNC’s products were within prescribed FDA guidelines, Schneiderman’s statement said. GNC will start DNA barcoding within 18 months to confirm the authenticity of all plants used as sources for its herbal supplements prior to processing, Schneiderman said. The company would test for allergen contamination pre and post production and had also agreed to prominently disclose in its stores and on its website if a supplement product was derived from whole herbs or extracts, Schneiderman said. Herbal Plus is part of GNC’s vitamins, minerals and herbal supplements business, which accounts for almost 40 percent of its U.S. retail revenue. The investigation into the supplements sold by Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp was ongoing, DeBold said. Walgreens was reviewing the matter and intends to continue cooperating with the Attorney General’s office, spokesperson James Graham said. Wal-Mart and Target were not available for comment.

602,TGT,New York questions big retailers over 'on-call' staffing,"(Reuters) - New York’s attorney general has sent letters to 13 national retailers, including Gap Inc, Target Corp and JC Penney Co Inc, about “on-call shifts” in which workers are told whether to report to work a day or less before a scheduled shift. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s letters, sent on Friday, say on-call systems leave “too little time to make arrangements for family needs, let alone to find an alternative source of income to compensate for the lost pay” on days the employees are not called in to work. A number of companies with stores in New York are requiring employees to check in by telephone, text message or email before a planned shift to see if their services are needed, Schneiderman wrote in the letters. The system allows retailers to adjust staffing based on store traffic forecasts made by scheduling software. The companies can then reduce over-staffing and under-staffing. His requests come as workers’ advocates claim success in efforts to increase pay and benefits at fast food companies and national retailers, including recent raises of minimum wages by McDonald’s Corp and Wal Mart Stores Inc. Schneiderman said the “on-call” practice might violate the law in New York, where employers are subject to a rule that says employees who report for a scheduled shift on any day have to be paid for at least four hours at the basic minimum hourly wage. Target said workers are informed of their schedules 10 days before the start of a work week and it does not employ “on-call” shifts. JC Penney said it has a policy against on-call scheduling. The Gap said it is committed to “sustainable scheduling practices” and is conducting research on the matter. Worker advocates say unpredictable scheduling is one of the key challenges facing low-wage workers.  “One of reasons it is coming to light now is that people are organizing around it,” said Tsedeye Gebreselassie, senior attorney at the National Employment Law Project. He noted that a 2011 union-backed study of New York retail workers showed a fifth surveyed were required to always or frequently be available for on-call shifts.  Bills addressing on-call scheduling are currently being considered in the state legislatures of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Minnesota, Oregon and California, according to the Center for Popular Democracy, a worker advocacy group. The U.S. Labor Department said it is aware of the on-call scheduling concerns and is looking into the matter. “This is an important issue for workers struggling with work-life balance, especially for women,” spokeswoman Tania Mejia said. Schneiderman asked the retailers to provide details on the processes they follow to schedule on-call shifts, such as whether they use computerized systems and penalize employees who do not follow on-call procedures. He also asked the companies for any analysis they might have conducted on cost savings associated with on-call shifts and the impact on workers’ wellbeing. The companies have until May 4 to send in their responses. The Gap said it was engaged in a research project with the UC Hastings College of Worklife Law to examine scheduling and productivity, and expects to receive some data in the fall of 2015. “In the meantime, each of our brands also has been working to evaluate and refine their practices to make improvements,” a spokeswoman for the retailer said. Letters were also sent to Abercrombie & Fitch Co, J. Crew, L Brands Inc, Burlington Coat Factory, TJX Cos Inc, Urban Outfitters Inc, Crocs Inc, Ann Inc, Sears Holdings Corp and Williams-Sonoma Inc. Sears and Ann Inc both said they do not use on-call scheduling. Representatives of the other retailers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

603,TGT,Target nears $20 million MasterCard data breach settlement: WSJ,"(Reuters) - Target Corp is nearing a settlement with MasterCard Inc to reimburse financial institutions about $20 million for costs incurred from the retailer’s massive data breach in 2013, the Wall Street Journal reported.  The deal, which comes after months of negotiations, could be announced as soon as this week, according to the Journal, citing people familiar with the terms of negotiations. The $20 million covers costs that banks incurred to reissue credit cards and debit cards as a result of the breach, as well as some of the fraud that resulted from the exposure of customer information, the newspaper said. In 2013, Target said at least 40 million credit cards were compromised by the breach during the holiday shopping season, and the attack might have resulted in the theft of personal information, such as email addresses and telephone numbers, from as many as 110 million people. MasterCard will distribute the reimbursed funds to the financial institutions that issue credit cards and debit cards under its brand, including Citigroup Inc, Capital One Financial Corp and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co, the Journal said. The Target settlement does not include financial institutions that issue under the Visa Inc brand. Target is negotiating separately with Visa, the report said.  In March, according to court documents, Target agreed to pay $10 million in a proposed settlement of a class-action lawsuit related to the data breach.  “We’ve seen the same story, but we do not comment on speculation,” MasterCard said when asked about the Journal’s report.

The lawyers want the court to throw out terms of the deal, which they contend were “surreptitiously” aimed at barring financial institutions from being part of the lawsuit. “The agreement between Target and MasterCard is nothing more than an attempt by Target to avoid fully reimbursing financial institutions for losses they suffered due to one of the largest data breaches in U.S. history,” said a statement on Wednesday from Charles Zimmerman of Zimmerman Reed PLLP and Karl Cambronne of Chestnut Cambronne PA, co-lead plaintiffs’ attorneys in the lawsuit. “It provides paltry restitution for the substantial losses suffered,” the statement added. “This sweetheart deal for Target was negotiated without involvement of the court or the legal representatives of the impacted financial institutions.” Lawyers for Target did not return calls seeking comment on the motion, which could prevent it from getting a release from claims in the class-action. The motion is due to be heard in federal court Monday. Target has said the amount under its settlement with MasterCard covers costs that banks incurred to reissue credit cards and debit cards to customers as a result of the data breach. In 2013, Target said at least 40 million credit cards were compromised by the breach during the winter holiday shopping season, and the attack might have resulted in the theft of personal information, such as email addresses and telephone numbers, from as many as 110 million people. Target is still in negotiations with Visa Inc over fallout from the breach. Payments under the settlement were to be made by the end of the second quarter and it was conditioned on issuers of at least 90 percent of eligible account holders accepting the offer by May 20, Target said.",4222015,http://www.reuters.com/article/target-settlement/banks-seek-to-block-targets-deal-with-mastercard-over-data-breach-idUSL1N0XJ3AK20150422

615,TGT,Canadian grocer Metro interested in Target stores,"(Reuters) - Metro Inc (MRU.TO) said it was interested in some of the stores being sold by Target Corp (TGT.N), becoming the second Canadian retailer to look at the stores the U.S. retailer leaves behind  after its exit from Canada. Target exited Canada after a two-year struggle related to logistics and resources that left its stores poorly stocked. “There are a few of those stores that could be of interest to us down the road if they become available,” Chief Executive Eric La Fleche said on a conference call on Wednesday. Target, which closed the last of its 133 retail stores on April 12, had said the real estate sales process was expected to be completed by June. Hudson’s Bay Co (HBC.TO) said in February that a joint venture by the company could consider some of the properties vacated by Target Canada. Metro, which converted some of its Metro stores into Food Basics discount grocery outlets to attract customers, bought a majority stake in bakery chain Première Moisson in June to expand its product offerings. Metro, which has faced stiff competition from larger rivals like Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N), reported 4.5 percent rise in same-store sales for the second quarter ended March 14. That helped boost the Montreal-based company’s quarterly profit 15 percent to C$111.6 million ($91.2 million), or 43 Canadian cents per share. The company, which also benefited from a 4 percent inflation in its food business, said revenue rose 6 percent to C$2.71 billion.

617,TGT,UPDATE 1-Canadian Tire to buy 12 Target property leases in Canada,"(Adds background, details from statement) May 6 (Reuters) - Retailer Canadian Tire Corp Ltd  said it would buy leases for 12 properties previously held by the Canadian unit of Target Corp for $17.7 million. The 12 locations, spread across the country, will add about 400,000 square feet of retail space to Canadian Tire Retail’s store network, the company said on Wednesday. Apart from its namesake automotive and homeware stores, Canadian Tire also operates Mark’s, a casual and industrial wear retailer, and FGL Sports, whose store brands include Sport Chek, Hockey Experts and Sports Experts. “We’ve been tracking certain Target properties for some time and when the opportunity came up, we moved quickly and secured virtually all of them,” Canadian Tire CEO Michael Medline said in a statement. U.S. discount retailer Target, granted creditor protection for its money-losing Canadian subsidiary, in April closed the last of its 133 retail stores in Canada. Canadian retailers Metro Inc and Hudson’s Bay Co  have also shown interest in leasing Target’s properties. Canadian Tire did not specify if the deal value was in U.S. or Canadian dollars.

619,TGT,Wage increases in focus ahead of retail earnings,"(Reuters) - Labor expenses will be a key focus during retailers’ earnings conference calls in the coming weeks, with many companies under pressure to boost workers’ wages at a time when low U.S. unemployment levels have given workers more leverage. Wal-Mart (WMT.N), Target Corp (TGT.N), T.J. Maxx (TJX.N), Gap (GPS.N), and McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) have already announced wage increases, and the trend appears to be trickling further into the retail and restaurant sectors. “The competition for that job is tougher for the employer. The employee has choices now,” said Thomas Sudyka, managing director at investment management firm Lawson Kroeker based in Omaha, Nebraska. So far in this reporting season, companies such as Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (BBBY.O) and Buffalo Wild Wings Inc BWLD.O have discussed wage pressure, while Pier 1 Imports Inc (PIR.N) plans incentive pay for the first time in three years.  Fast-food workers have been vocal in fighting for better wages. They rallied in U.S. cities on April 15 to demand higher pay, using the deadline for filing tax returns to publicize their argument that they cannot survive on the hourly wages paid by many U.S. corporations. The U.S. government said Friday U.S. job growth rebounded last month and the unemployment rate dropped to a near seven-year low of 5.4 percent, while average hourly earnings rose three cents in April, a year-on-year gain of 2.2 percent.  Big retailers reporting in the week starting May 13 include Macys Inc (M.N), Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) and Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N).  The following week, Home Depot (HD.N), Wal-Mart, Staples Inc SPLS.O, Target and Gap are due to report. Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) both report on May 27. Macys, Kohl’s and Home Depot say they set their wages on a market-by-market basis as the competitive situation varies around the country. Kohl’s said it also watches other factors driving employee decisions, such as the work environment and future opportunities for advancement.   Staples in March discussed a 2014 cash build-up for incentive compensation that would be paid out in 2015 but it did not give details. Bed Bath & Beyond said during a conference call early in April it had planned for an additional expense of 6 cents a share this year due to increased compensation. Analysts expect Bed Bath & Beyond to earn about $1.91 per share this year on a fully reported basis, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  “We are modeling an increase in our investments in compensation and benefits beyond what we have always historically planned for, to continue to assure that we preserve our ability to attract, and retain, the best associates,” Sue Lattmann, the company’s chief financial officer told investors. Many companies will try to cut other costs, or raise prices where they can to absorb the extra expense of higher wages, said Lawson Kroeker’s Sudyka. During its quarterly conference call on April 28, Buffalo Wild Wings told investors it faced pressure to raise the salaries of minimum wage workers as well as higher-paid workers. There were also additional labor costs from the creation of new roles aimed at boosting sales.   Chief Operating Officer James Schmidt told investors that “if labor has to be a little higher, but it’s driving higher same-store sales, we would look and try to look at other lines of the (profit and loss statement) where we can recapture that.” Some analysts said investors will likely take wage increases in their stride, as better pay should translate to improved sales, with consumers having more money to spend. “Even if companies can’t pass on the costs, it’s a one-time hit and we can grow from there,” Sudyka said.

620,TGT,Target-MasterCard settlement moves ahead despite judge's doubts,"(Reuters) - A federal judge has rejected a bid from a group of banks and credit unions suing Target Corp over its 2013 data breach to block the company’s proposed $19 million settlement with MasterCard Inc. U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson in St. Paul, Minnesota,  wrote in a ruling Thursday that the deal does not appear “altogether fair or reasonable” but he could not legally intervene without evidence that Target or MasterCard had made misleading or coercive statements. “Although the settlement may not pass the ‘smell test,’ as the saying goes, it is not serious misconduct,” Magnuson said. The settlement is contingent on banks that issued at least 90 percent of the MasterCard accounts signing on to the agreement. Lawyers for the plaintiffs had argued that the settlement with MasterCard, which is not a party to the lawsuit, was a “sweetheart deal” aimed at undercutting their claims for losses. Under the proposed agreement, announced in March, MasterCard-issuing banks have until May 20 to accept a percentage of the money from MasterCard. If they accept the deal, they must drop further claims against Target as part of the settlement. Banks that reject the deal would continue to pursue their own allegations against Target. Lawyers for the banks have estimated the total losses at more than $160 million, with approximately half for fraud and half for the cost of reissuing nearly nine million credit cards. In a statement, the lead plaintiffs’ lawyers highlighted the judge’s concerns and said they would urge banks to reject the deal. A Target spokeswoman, Molly Snyder, said, “We are pleased with the court’s decision which we believe will allow us to resolve claims with participating MasterCard issuers and avoid protracted litigation with those issuers.” The judge’s ruling said that MasterCard initially demanded $26 million before the two sides settled on $19 million. In 2013, Target said the breach during the holiday shopping season compromised at least 40 million credit cards and may have resulted in the theft of personal information from as many as 110 million people.

Wal-Mart said in February it planned to invest about C$340 million this year to boost its presence in Canada. The company said on Friday it would acquire a Target Canada distribution center, 12 store leases and an owned property for C$165 million. It expects to invest about C$185 million on their renovation.

627,TGT,Target profit tops estimates on healthy sales growth,"(Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) on Wednesday reported a larger-than-expected rise in quarterly profit, citing robust online sales and strong demand for products at the center of its growth plan. The fourth-largest U.S. retailer raised the low end of its fiscal-year outlook and said it repurchased $562 million worth of its shares in the quarter. This resumption of buybacks after nearly two years is the latest sign it had rebounded from a crippling data breach in late 2013. Still, Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan said consumer sentiment remained “choppy” and that it was hard to say whether Target was taking market share from Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), which posted disappointing results on Tuesday. Target shares were up 0.4 percent at $78.23 in morning trading.  Excluding restructuring costs and other items, earnings rose to $1.10 per share in the first quarter ended May 2 from 92 cents a year earlier. Analysts on average expected $1.03 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Target said sales at stores open at least a year rose 2.3 percent, matching the market consensus, according to Consensus Metrix. One-third of the growth came from online sales, which jumped 38 percent. Under Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell, who took the job in August, Target has been promoting a narrower set of products that include apparel, items for children and babies, and the health and wellness category. Mulligan said sales of those higher-margin “signature categories” were double the company average. Since Target pulled out of the Canadian market earlier this year, “we are really seeing the benefit of being able to focus on our U.S. business,” Mulligan said on a media call.           Target raised the low end of its full-year earnings outlook to $4.50 per share from $4.45 before special items while keeping the high end at $4.65. In March, Cornell announced plans to cut $2 billion in costs. The restructuring included eliminating several thousand corporate jobs, a revamp of grocery operations and investments in technology and the supply chain.        Including restructuring costs, Target said first-quarter net earnings from continuing operations rose 14 percent to $651 million. Sales increased 2.8 percent to $17.12 billion.

628,TGT,UPDATE 3-Target profit tops estimates on healthy sales growth,"(Adds Breakingviews link) By Nathan Layne May 20 (Reuters) - Target Corp on Wednesday reported a larger-than-expected rise in quarterly profit, citing robust online sales and strong demand for products at the center of its growth plan. The fourth-largest U.S. retailer raised the low end of its fiscal-year outlook and said it repurchased $562 million worth of its shares in the quarter. This resumption of buybacks after nearly two years is the latest sign it had rebounded from a crippling data breach in late 2013.

The central bank has said it will raise rates only when data suggests that the economy is strengthening. Growth slowed to a crawl in the first quarter. Recent data has painted a mixed picture. Consumption, business spending and manufacturing data has suggested the economy is struggling, but housing starts were strong. While the Fed is broadly expected to raise rates this year, the timing of the move has kept the market on tenterhooks. “There is a consensus that the Fed probably doesn’t move until September and I don’t think that will change today,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. The latest Reuters survey showed most economists were now less convinced about when rates would be increased, but the median still suggested a move in the third quarter. A rate hike is not likely to be appropriate until early 2016, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Wednesday. The minutes of Fed’s April meeting are expected to be released at 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). The Dow Jones industrial average closed at a record high for the second straight day on Tuesday. Earlier in the session, it hit an all-time intraday high of 18,351.36. “If interest rates were to go up sharply, then yes, the markets are overvalued, but that’s not going to happen,” said Hogan. S&P; 500 e-mini futures were down 0.25 points and their fair value - a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract - indicated a flat open. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures rose 8 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures added 2.75 points. Yahoo Inc gained 2.9 percent to $42.20 premarket after the company said a potential change in tax rules on spinoffs was not specific to its plan to spin off its stake in Alibaba. The stock fell 7.6 percent on Tuesday. Target rose 1.4 percent to $79.01 after it reported a larger-than-expected increase in profit and raised the lower end of its full-year earnings forecast range.

634,TGT,"Small food makers on fast path to U.S. store shelves, threatening big producers","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Small U.S. food manufacturers once toiled for decades to develop a critical mass of fans for their products. Now, an increasing number of privately-held players are going from garage to grocery store in fewer than five years thanks to an erosion of barriers to entry within the food industry. The trend is visible everywhere from gluten-free and organic foods to more traditional fare, according to interviews with half a dozen startups, as well as retailers and industry consultants. Contract manufacturers have made it easier for small companies to produce goods inexpensively, while the reach of digital advertising allows them to target consumers without big marketing budgets, industry experts said.  More mass-market retailers want niche brands that shoppers view as healthier to drive traffic in stores, particularly as they face rising competition from natural food and specialty chains like Whole Foods Market Inc WFM.O.  “It’s never been easier in the history of food for a new organic company to get their products on shelves,” said Arjan Stephens, executive vice president of sales and marketing at Nature’s Path Foods. The privately-held organic breakfast cereal brand was founded in 1985 and took nearly two decades to gain traction with mainstream retailers.  In the ice cream business, for example, sales of some major U.S. brands have faltered. But one beneficiary is a little-known frozen dessert company called Arctic Zero.  The fat-free, lactose-free and gluten-free product originated out of a soft serve machine in a Temecula, California garage. Arctic Zero hit the retail big leagues in 2013 when it gained coveted space in the freezers of Kroger Co (KR.N) just three years after launch. It is now also available at Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Whole Foods and on Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN.O). “Everyone has been looking for a ‘better for you’ alternative in ice cream,” said Arctic Zero CEO Amit Pandhi. “There just hasn’t been any innovation until our brand came along.”  Overall, small and midsize consumer goods companies have stolen $18 billion in U.S. sales, or 2 percentage points of share, away from large players since 2009, according to a March report by IRI and the Boston Consulting Group. In 2014 alone, they took 0.7 points of share from big manufacturers. Last year’s U.S. sales of snack bars help illustrate the trend. According to Euromonitor International, giant food companies General Mills Inc (GIS.N) and Kellogg Co (K.N) had market share declines of 0.3 points and 1.9 points, respectively, compared with 2013. The privately-held Clif Bar & Co gained 1 percentage point during the period, and another small rival, Kind LLC, increased its share by 2.1 points. The pace of overall share gains is accelerating as small organic and natural food purveyors win more shelf space at mass-market stores.      “They’re able to really focus on a subset of consumers and subset of retailers, and win in those areas and use that as a platform to grow into mainstream areas,” said Dan Wald, a partner at Boston Consulting Group. Talenti, a gelato maker that uses hormone-free milk and pure cane sugar, employed such a strategy shortly after beginning production in a 1,000 square foot factory in Dallas.  In 2007, when gelato was still a new concept in U.S. supermarkets, the company approached natural food and specialty stores like Sprouts Farmers Market Inc (SFM.O), Whole Foods and Fairway Group Holdings Corp FWM.O. Once the frozen treat proved its success, Talenti pitched more mainstream chains like Publix Super Markets Inc and Kroger.  “It was really an exercise in discipline and retail mapping,” said Talenti CEO Steve Gill. “The worst thing we could do was put it into a retail format that was not yet ready for it and have it fail.” Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) bought Talenti last year for an undisclosed sum. To be sure, getting on the shelves of a Target or Kroger isn’t easy, and competition for those spots is increasing. The number of companies exhibiting at Natural Products Expo West, a popular trade show where many food makers get noticed by buyers for retail chains, has increased 74 percent to 2,768 since 2005, according to New Hope Natural Media, the show’s organizers.  Major food companies are also waging a counter-offensive, dropping some artificial additives from their well-known brands, creating new products they say are healthier, and acquiring natural or organic food brands that have proven themselves.  General Mills bought organic food maker Annie’s Inc, best known for its bunny-shaped macaroni and cheese, for $820 million in October. Hershey bought Krave, an upscale jerky company, in March. It didn’t disclose the price.       “We are certainly seeing that there is a pronounced consumer trend toward health and wellness alternatives,” Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) CEO Irene Rosenfeld said in an interview last month. The maker of Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate acquired Enjoy Life, an allergen-free food company, earlier this year. “As the world’s largest snacking company, it is our desire to be meeting those needs.” For the small food players, that makes getting the right placement on shelves critical. Steve Hersh, co-founder of Utmost Brands Inc, started selling the company’s GuS Grown-Up Soda to retailers out of his Subaru in 2003. A year later, single bottles of GuS were lost among other options in the aisles of Stop & Shop Supermarket Company LLC, which eventually stopped offering the product. GuS contains less sugar than the average soda and is marketed to adults. Retailers are now catching on to its appeal and giving it prime placement.  “Now you go to a Wegmans or Food Emporium, you’re going to see our four packs on a four-foot (wide) shelf, and you’re going to go, ‘oh, that’s a brand,’ rather than three little bottles in a sea of soda,” Hersh said.  Finding the right distributor can also help small players build scale. Months after GuS launched, Hersh was contacted by Big Geyser, a major beverage distributor in New York that helped get the soda into Whole Foods and Fairway.   Food makers may still have to jump through hoops to satisfy retailers. One hurdle is the fees that major stores charge food makers to gain shelf space, which can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Retailers may waive such fees depending on the number of options in the category and the ability of a novel brand to draw shoppers. But they may also make companies change the packaging of the product, a potentially costly move.  For instance, nutrition bar company Mediterra Inc received interest from Target Corp (TGT.N) to join a trial run of new brands in its stores.  Target asked for the bars to be sold in a five pack that Mediterra didn’t offer. The company designed the new packs with the help of its contract manufacturer and produced them in about 45 days, said Paul Pruett, Mediterra’s CEO.  The trial at Target concluded in April, and the product is no longer on the shelves. It did, though, raise the brand’s profile, and the bars will be sold in about 400 Kroger stores later this year, Pruett said.  Small food makers do need to be aware of how demanding their often social-media savvy, health conscious consumers are, executives said.  For example, Arctic Zero recently received requests to put a seal on the product to show it hasn’t been opened. Arctic Zero is discussing the move, which could cost a few hundred thousand dollars, with its contract manufacturers, CEO Pandhi said.    ",5212015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-food-upstarts-insight/small-food-makers-on-fast-path-to-u-s-store-shelves-threatening-big-producers-idUSKBN0O60FN20150521

636,TGT,"MasterCard, Target data breach settlement falls apart","(Reuters) - A proposed $19 million settlement between MasterCard Inc and Target Corp over the retailer’s 2013 data breach fell through after not enough banks accepted the deal, the credit card company said on Thursday. The agreement, announced in April, would have provided up to $19 million to banks and credit unions that sued Target in federal court in Minnesota over the breach. The lead lawyers for the banks had argued that the settlement with MasterCard, which was not a party to the lawsuit, was an attempt to undercut their claims for damages. But a federal judge earlier this month rejected the banks’ attempt to block the deal, though he expressed concerns about its fairness.

The total average cost of a data breach is now $3.8 million, up from $3.5 million a year ago, according to a study by data security research organization Ponemon Institute, paid for by International Business Machines Corp. The direct costs include hiring experts to fix the breach, investigating the cause, setting up hotlines for customers and offering credit monitoring for victims. Business lost because customers are wary after a breach can be even greater, the study said.  Data breaches are becoming more common and significant, with high-profile attacks on Sony Corp, JPMorgan Chase and retailers Target Corp and Home Depot Inc in the past year and a half. “Most of what’s occurring is through organized crime,” said Caleb Barlow, vice president of IBM Security. “These are well-funded groups.

A person familiar with the matter said the document was one of several prepared ahead of a board meeting scheduled for Tuesday evening and that it was published inadvertently. The board is due to discuss dividend and buyback policy and has not voted on a plan yet, the person said, describing the document as “contingency planning”. The company in a statement said it had not officially released any information and did not comment further. Target pulled the statement after it was reported by news media. Reuters took a screenshot of the statement at 3:38 pm ET, shortly before it was taken down. The statement had said the quarterly dividend, raised from 52 cents per share, was supposed to be payable on Sept. 10. The current share buyback program of $5 billion was being expanded to $10 billion, it said. Target, the fourth-largest U.S. retailer, said last month it repurchased $562 million worth of its shares in its fiscal fourth quarter ended May 2. It had resumed buybacks after nearly two years. “We expect to have the capacity to increase our annual dividend - and repurchase billions of dollars of Target shares annually - while maintaining our current credit ratings,” Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan had said in the statement.

The Minneapolis, Minnesota-based retailer said it had invested $3.7 billion through the first quarter of 2015 to retire 56.9 million shares under the buyback program. Target also raised its quarterly dividend to 56 cents per share from 52 cents in the prior quarter. “Given our outlook for capital expenditures and the strong cash generation of our core business, we expect to have the capacity to increase our annual dividend and repurchase billions of dollars of Target shares annually while maintaining our current credit ratings,” Target Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan said in a statement. The decision was made at a board meeting on Tuesday evening, ahead of its annual shareholders’ meeting in San Francisco the following day. But the move had already been flagged to investors earlier on Tuesday when a release that detailed its buyback and dividend plans was mistakenly posted to its website during internal preparations for possible decisions out of the board meeting, according to a person familiar with the matter. Target pulled the release after it was reported by news media. It acknowledged a link to a document had gone live but said it had not officially released any information. Reuters took a screenshot of the statement at 3:38 pm ET, shortly before it was taken down. The board’s decision matched the contents of the earlier release. It was the second time a retailer slipped up with disclosure in recent months. In April department store operator J.C. Penney said a senior executive inadvertently disclosed its same-stores sales performance to a securities analyst in an email. Target repurchased $562 million worth of its shares in the first quarter ended May 2, resuming buybacks after nearly two years in the latest sign the retailer has rebounded from a damaging data breach in late 2013. Last month, Mulligan had said the board was going to consider expanding its share buyback framework, given that after the first quarter purchases it only had about $1.3 billion left on its existing program.

644,TGT,CVS-Target deal could spur supermarkets to find pharmacy partners,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Target Corp’s (TGT.N) sale of its in-store pharmacies to CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) may encourage large supermarket chains with struggling pharmacies to look for professional drug store partners of their own. More than 1,660 Target pharmacies will become CVS units in the $1.9 billion deal, the first time a drugstore chain has expanded its pharmacy business within a third party retail store, pharmacy consultants and analysts said. Drug stores in recent years have focused on opening new stores, an effort which has slowed recently. Target pharmacies helped drive overall sales at the chain but lost money, as the government health care program known as Obamacare expanded ranks of insured and increased pressure on costs. “Grocery store chains must be taking the news today and thinking hard about it. Pharmacy is not really a core competence,” said Todd Huseby, partner, AT Kearney said, citing Safeway and Albertsons as two companies that might consider it. Neither responded to a request for comment. Some supermarkets may have the scale and buying power to make their own pharmacies work, said Neil Stern, senior partner at retail consulting firm McMillan Doolittle. They may see the store-in-store format as an opening for a competitor, he said. However, margins are eroding, said Adam Fein, president of advisory and research firm Pembroke Consulting.  “The future of pharmacy is really about being a low cost buyer of generic drugs and capability to dispense specialty drugs and that is an area of challenge for several supermarket operators,” he said. Supermarkets with pharmacies such as Kroger (KR.N), Safeway and Stop & Shop saw a 0.6 percent increase in the number of prescriptions filled, but a 0.17 percent decline in prescription market share in 2014 from a year earlier, data from Fein’s blog Drug Channels showed. Last year, prescriptions filled at chain drugstores like CVS, Walgreens WBA.N, Rite Aid (RAD.N) rose 5.1 percent, with 1.41 percent growth in prescription market share, while mass merchant chains like Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) increased market share by 0.32 percent. Wal-Mart’s health and wellness business has been performing very well, and it sees no need to have pharmacies handled by another company, spokeswoman Sarah McKinney said. Drug store chains could look to stores-in-stores as a way to get “immediate access to new markets at a much lower cost,” than building their own stores, said Tom Charland, chief executive at consulting firm Merchant Medicine.

645,TGT,CVS Health to buy Target's pharmacy business for $1.9 billion,"(Reuters) - Drugstore operator CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) will buy Target Corp’s (TGT.N) pharmacies and clinics in a $1.9 billion deal that should help it bargain with drug makers for lower prices, while freeing Target from a costly business where it struggled to make a profit.  CVS, the second-largest U.S. drugstore operator with 7,800 stores, said on Monday it will acquire Target’s more than 1,660 pharmacies in 47 states with about $4 billion in annual sales. It will also acquire Target’s nearly 80 clinics. The pharmacies will continue to be located within Target stores but carry the CVS brand.  The move was the CVS’ second large acquisition in as many months, coming on the heels of its $10.1 billion deal for healthcare services firm Omnicare Inc OCR.N in May.   The transaction will significantly expand the drugstore chain’s retail presence and should bolster its bargaining power with pharmaceutical companies.  “The healthcare industry is evolving rapidly,” CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said on a conference call. “In this environment, success is all about effectively managing costs, quality and access.”   For Target, the deal divests a business that was “modestly negative” in terms of profits. While Target will lose revenue, its sales, general and administrative costs will drop by $1 billion. Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell said the move fits with the company’s focus on a handful of categories where it believes it can be most competitive including apparel, items for children and health and wellness-related goods. Target will continue to handle the sale of over-the-counter drugs. Cornell, who has been remaking the retailer’s strategy since taking the helm in August, said the deal will allow it to focus resources on reviving its food business, for instance.  He also said it should bring more customers into Target stores. The companies hope CVS’ price advantages, including in generic drugs, will attract more customers to the pharmacies who then buy other items from Target.  “They bring scale, cost efficiency; they bring expertise that we just could not bring to a space that we were operating as a subscale player,” Cornell said of CVS. CVS shares were up 0.7 percent at $102.88, while Target shares rose 1.3 percent to $80.51 in morning trading. The two companies said the 80 Target clinics will be rebranded as MinuteClinics, as will the 20 additional clinics they plan to open within three years of the deal closing, expected near the end of 2015.. Target and CVS also said they plan to co-develop five to 10 small-format stores, potentially accelerating Target’s strategy of finding growth through smaller outlets in urban areas. The deal will also affect both companies’ plans for share buybacks. Target said it would likely use some of the expected $1.2 billion in after-tax proceeds for shares repurchases. It doubled its share buyback program to $10 billion last week. In contrast, CVS cut its 2015 share repurchase program by $1 billion to $5 billion as a result of the transaction, which it will finance with debt. The move adds to the strain on its finances, already under pressure from the Omnicare deal. CVS’ reduced buyback target led it to lower its 2015 and 2016 adjusted earnings forecast.

649,TGT,"Minnesota banks on higher taxes, minimum wage as script for growth","MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - It is too early to tell how a recent round of tax hikes and a minimum wage increase will play out in Minnesota, a state where liberal and conservative forces have often swapped control and policies. But the state’s experience may give pause to a crowded field of Republican presidential hopefuls who largely swear by tax cuts and small government as a recipe for prosperity.  Judged by those standards this state on the Canadian border should be a train wreck in process.  Instead, Democratic Governor Mark Dayton’s Minnesota could become a touchstone in the national debate over how to bolster the middle class - an example of how solid growth and low unemployment can coexist with some of the highest income and corporate tax rates in the country. Born into family wealth but a left-leaning Democrat by temperament, Dayton said in an interview that, to him, one fix for income inequality was pretty obvious: take some from the better off and spread it around. “The wealthiest pay a smaller percentage of local tax than anyone, all the way down to the bottom,” Dayton told Reuters. “From a tax equity standpoint I felt an additional two percent on the wealthiest two percent was appropriate.”  The $2 billion that the state raised by pushing its top income tax rate to 9.85 percent in 2013 helped wipe out a budget deficit and fund a tax cut for middle income families. The income tax imposed by most U.S. states on local residents comes on top of federal taxes, and the increase in Minnesota made its top tax rate the fourth highest in the country.(Graphic: the Minnesota formula: link.reuters.com/juj25w) A minimum wage rise approved in 2014 boosted pay for the working poor and linked future increases to inflation. When the tax hike generated a surplus, Dayton argued to spend the money on early childhood education rather than scale back the taxes - and persuaded a divided state legislature to go along. The 2016 presidential election is likely to be shaped by debate over just such policies, and whether they might be an answer to deepening income inequality and stagnant middle and lower class incomes. Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton has not laid out an economic plan yet and most potential Republican contenders oppose income redistribution and advocate tax and spending cuts. One of them, Scott Walker, governor of neighboring Wisconsin, has pushed through $2 billion in tax cuts, weakened unions and is now proposing more spending cuts in education and health.  Yet so far, Wisconsin has lagged the nation and its neighbor in job creation and economic growth. Minnesota’s jobless rate has fallen to 3.8 percent, well below the national average of 5.3 percent. It bounced back quick from the recession and companies, such as Amazon, have pressed ahead with expansions plans there.  Analysts on the left have taken note. The 2016 race “is going to be ‘trickle down’ versus ‘middle out,’” said David Madland, director of economic policy at the Center for American Progress, a think tank in Washington with close ties to the Democratic party. “Minnesota is a perfect example of the middle class economics story.” Politically, the state is known for its sharp contrasts, its choice of public officials ranging from the Midwestern social liberalism of former vice presidents Walter Mondale and Hubert Humphrey to Tea Party firebrand and former lawmaker Michele Bachmann. The state’s economy, in contrast, has been steady and predictable, with a solid industrial base, a legacy agricultural sector, and a prominent group of companies headquartered there. That includes Target Corp., the national retailer built by Dayton’s family. The unemployment rate since at least the mid-1970s typically runs two percentage points below the national average. Median family income, at almost $60,000, is more than 10 percent above the national level. The state has gone through growth spurts where it outperformed the country and spells where it has lagged. But high taxes have never proved a permanent drag.  Still, the national trend in recent years has been in favor of tax cuts. Over the last decade states have cut income and corporate taxes twice as often as they hiked them, according to data from the National Association of State Budget Officers. Those, including California, that have recently hiked income taxes have typically put fixed expiry dates on the increase to make them politically palatable. At least in recent years, “Minnesota has been the outlier,” said Jared Walczak, a policy analyst at the Tax Foundation. Beth Kadoun, head of tax policy at the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, said the jury on Dayton’s policies was still out.  “I don’t think we’ve seen the impact. We had a strong 2013. Look at 2014. Do we continue to outpace?” Kadoun said.  Minnesota’s economy grew 1.4 percent last year, above the Midwest average, but below the 2.2 percent national rate. Wage growth remains weak despite low unemployment. The chamber and other business groups have opposed the tax hikes and continue to push back against parts of the governor’s agenda, including the indexation of the minimum wage.  But Dayton said his state’s record at least proves that taxes don’t necessarily destroy growth.  In fact, tax cuts have backfired in Wisconsin and Kansas, where Republican governor Sam Brownback cut income taxes only to reverse course and raise other levies as a budget deficit ballooned.  “During this period where other states have been cutting taxes we have held our own and in the last couple of years have done better,” Dayton said. “It works for us.” ",7102015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-minnesota-taxes-insight/minnesota-banks-on-higher-taxes-minimum-wage-as-script-for-growth-idUSKCN0PK0BT20150710

The moves are the latest management changes announced by the company under new CEO Brian Cornell, who took over last August, as it restructures and focuses on fewer products.

656,TGT,Target reaches agreement with Visa over data breach,"(Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) said it has reached an agreement with Visa Inc (V.N) card issuers to reimburse up to $67 million in costs related to a data breach at the retailer in 2013, according to a source familiar with the matter. The breach during the holiday shopping season compromised at least 40 million credit cards and may have resulted in the theft of personal information from as many as 110 million people. The agreement comes three months after a proposed $19 million settlement between Target and Mastercard Inc (MA.N) fell through as not enough banks accepted the deal.   A lawyer representing banks that are suing Target said financial institutions should not accept the “optional alternative recovery offer” as that requires them to release the retailer from a class action lawsuit. “Just as with the proposed MasterCard settlement...this deal was negotiated under a veil of secrecy without the involvement of the court or the court-appointed legal representatives of financial institutions,” Charles Zimmerman of Zimmerman Reed said. The Mastercard deal required the approval of banks that issued at least 90 percent of the MasterCard accounts.  “(The agreement with Visa) fails to fully reimburse card issuers for the substantial losses suffered from the Target data breach,” Zimmerman said in an email on Tuesday. Financial institutions have sued Target, saying they have spent billions of dollars to replace compromised cards and beef up customer service operations because of the data breach.  Target said on Tuesday the agreement with Visa was based on a condition that a subset of Visa card issuers entered into direct settlements with Target and Visa. Target’s breach was followed by an attack on Home Depot Inc (HD.N) which revealed theft of some 56 million payment cards in September last year.

660,TGT,Target's quarterly sales outlook disappoints; shares dip,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) forecast disappointing sales for this quarter and said it expected consumer demand to remain choppy, causing its shares to give up early gains. Earlier on Wednesday, the fourth-largest U.S. retailer reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast, citing strong demand for clothing and other merchandise at the center of its growth plan.  Chief Operating Officer John Mulligan said on a conference call with analysts that he expected sales at stores open at least a year to increase 1 percent to 2 percent this quarter, including digital sales growth of about 30 percent.  Analysts called the comparable sales estimate conservative.     Target’s same-store sales rose 2.4 percent in the second quarter ended on Aug. 1, which research firm Consensus Metrix said beat market expectations of 2.2 percent. A 30 percent rise in digital sales contributed 0.6 percentage points. Target also said it urgently needed to adjust inventory levels so that its shelves are sufficiently stocked.  In the year since Brian Cornell became chief executive officer, Target has been promoting a narrower set of “signature” products including apparel, baby products and wellness items including organic goods.  Sales of those products increased three times faster than the company average during the second quarter ended on Aug. 1, Mulligan said. Under Cornell, Target has also reshuffled its management, exited its struggling Canadian operations and spent more on online sales. In March, Cornell announced a restructuring plan to eliminate several thousand corporate jobs and revamp grocery operations. It also included a $1 billion investment in technology in areas such as supply chain. For the fiscal year, Target said it expected earnings of $4.60 to $4.75 per share, excluding special items. Analysts on average forecast $4.62, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In May, the company had raised the lower end of its forecast by 5 cents a share to between $4.50 and $4.65.  Excluding restructuring charges and other special items, earnings rose to $1.22 per share from $1.01 a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting $1.11, Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S said. Net sales rose 2.8 percent to $17.4 billion, meeting Wall Street expectations. Target shares rose as much as 5.4 percent in the morning, but were down 1.1 percent at $79.45 by early afternoon.

664,TGT,RPT-New Target COO's headache: Too few goods to keep shelves filled,"(Repeats with no change to text) By Nandita Bose CHICAGO, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Two days after being promoted to the new position of Target Corp’s Chief Operating Officer, John Mulligan’s big job is clear: fix a supply chain that the company blamed for shortages of goods that are undermining sales growth. On Wednesday, the fourth-largest U.S. retailer blamed its “incredibly complex supply chain” for unacceptable stock levels at its stores this year, forecasting weak growth in current quarter sales at established stores. The focus on the supply chain network is the latest move by  CEO Brian Cornell, who took charge a year ago and announced a restructuring plan in March. Under that program, Cornell eliminated several thousand corporate jobs, revamped grocery operations and announced a $1 billion investment in supply chain technology. Mulligan, who was promoted from the position of chief financial officer on Monday, said that in-store product stock levels have been getting worse over the last couple of quarters. Kathee Tesija, the company’s former chief merchandising and supply chain officer, was moved to an advisory role in June. “Given the breadth and complexity of the business, it will always be a challenge to be in stock on every item in every store... but our guests need us to be consistent in delivering everyday essentials,” Mulligan said. Target’s supply-chain problems have grown more acute as it has expanded its offering of consumable goods such as meat, fresh produce and dairy products, which in turn have brought customers back to their stores more frequently than in the past. Target’s larger rival, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, has struggled to tackle the problem of running out of stock at its own stores for several years, despite having one of the largest and most sophisticated supply chain networks in the business. Analysts and industry consultants said that while Wal-Mart’s problems revolve around insufficient employees to fill shelves, an issue the company is addressing, Target’s issues stem from its reliance on external distributors. “Target tends to use outside wholesalers and outsources a large amount of distribution, typically on fast-moving consumables,” said Burt Flickinger, managing director at retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group. Products such as groceries, fresh produce, meat, dairy are replenished up to a 100 times or more every year, and when an outside wholesaler short-ships, Target’s stores suffer. The clear solution would be to take control of its supply chain, he added. “They have had problems in the past with it and they probably rely on third-party wholesalers and distributors more than they need to,” said Brian Yarbrough, retail analyst at Edward Jones. In an earnings conference call Target said its supply chain was built to serve an outdated model in which product flowed from vendors through distribution centers to stores. The company did not respond to subsequent requests for comment. Target also has tried to order less inventory than rivals, striving to turn over inventory quickly and reduce capital needs. Typically, retailers like to keep enough stock in their stores to meet around 90 percent of anticipated demand, and over 96 percent for advertised or promotional items, Yarbrough said. “Target historically has leaned on the side of under-ordering or under-allocating to keep inventory turns high,” said Neil Stern, senior partner at retail consultancy McMillan-Doolittle.

Analysts and industry consultants said that while Wal-Mart’s problems revolve around insufficient employees to fill shelves, an issue the company is addressing, Target’s issues stem from its reliance on external distributors. “Target tends to use outside wholesalers and outsources a large amount of distribution, typically on fast-moving consumables,” said Burt Flickinger, managing director at retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group. Products such as groceries, fresh produce, meat, dairy are replenished up to a 100 times or more every year, and when an outside wholesaler short-ships, Target’s stores suffer. The clear solution would be to take control of its supply chain, he added. “They have had problems in the past with it and they probably rely on third-party wholesalers and distributors more than they need to,” said Brian Yarbrough, retail analyst at Edward Jones. In an earnings conference call Target said its supply chain was built to serve an outdated model in which product flowed from vendors through distribution centers to stores. The company did not respond to subsequent requests for comment. Target also has tried to order less inventory than rivals, striving to turn over inventory quickly and reduce capital needs. Typically, retailers like to keep enough stock in their stores to meet around 90 percent of anticipated demand, and over 96 percent for advertised or promotional items, Yarbrough said. “Target historically has leaned on the side of under-ordering or under-allocating to keep inventory turns high,” said Neil Stern, senior partner at retail consultancy McMillan-Doolittle.

667,TGT,"Target settles with U.S. on charge of race, gender bias in hiring","(Reuters) - Target Corp has agreed to pay $2.8 million to settle a U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charge that it used hiring tests that disproportionately screened out candidates for various professional positions based on race and gender. The EEOC on Monday said three “employment assessments,” which Target no longer uses, were not sufficiently job-related or necessary for the discount retailer’s business, and therefore violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It also said one of the assessments, which was performed by psychologists, violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, which bans employers from subjecting applicants to medical exams before receiving job offers. The EEOC said the settlement payment will be distributed among thousands of people affected by Target’s employment screening.

The current license will expire on Jan. 31, 2017, Cherokee said in a statement on Thursday. Target has been licensing the Cherokee brand for almost two decades. Cherokee earned $15.0 million in royalty revenue from Target for the Cherokee brand, excluding Canada sales and school uniforms category sales, in fiscal 2015, according to Cherokee’s annual filing. The royalty revenue accounted for 43 percent of Cherokee’s total revenue for the period, according to the filing. “The termination of our license agreement with Target for Cherokee branded products would have a material adverse effect on our business,” Cherokee had said in the filing. The company also reported a 3.2 percent decline in second-quarter sales, hurt by weak demand for Cherokee-branded products in the UK and Canada.

672,TGT,U.S. judge certifies class action over Target Corp data breach,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday certified a class action against Target Corp (TGT.N) brought by several banks over the retailer’s massive data breach in 2013. U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson in St. Paul, Minnesota, said the banks could pursue their claims together over the breach, which compromised at least 40 million credit cards during the holiday season. In a statement, Charles Zimmerman, one of the lead lawyers representing the banks, said, “This important ruling brings financial institutions one step closer to collectively holding Target accountable for its unprecedented data breach.” Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said the company was “disappointed” and would evaluate its next steps after reviewing the decision. The ruling, which makes a settlement with the banks more likely, comes four weeks after Target agreed to pay as much as $67 million to financial institutions that issue Visa Inc (V.N) cards, in a deal struck directly with the credit card network. Earlier this year, a proposed $19 million settlement with MasterCard Inc (MA.N) fell through when not enough banks accepted the agreement. It is not clear how many Visa card issuers accepted the terms of that deal by the deadline of Sept. 4. Snyder declined to comment on the number of institutions that have agreed to participate in the Visa deal but emphasized that the class action includes only those card issuers that have not settled their claims. Attorney Zimmerman has said the Visa deal, like the failed MasterCard settlement, does not fully reimburse banks for their losses and was negotiated without input from the plaintiffs. Carrie Hunt, the general counsel for the National Association of Federal Credit Unions, praised the judge’s decision and said it “constitutes one important avenue for recovery” for credit unions affected by the breach.

676,TGT,"Target challenges Amazon, enters grocery delivery with Instacart","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Target Corp said on Tuesday it has partnered with Instacart Inc to deliver groceries for as little as $3.99 per order, as it overhauls its food business and competes with Amazon.com Inc’s grocery delivery service. The discount retailer will launch a pilot to test the offering in its hometown of Minneapolis and customers in some areas will be able to order online for food, pet products and baby items from two Target stores and have them delivered to their homes. Target has been revamping its grocery department after customer complaints about freshness and product quality, and  the business has been a key priority for Chief Executive Brian Cornell. The company’s grocery division accounted for more than 20 percent of revenue last year, with approximately $18 billion in sales. The push expands online order options for Target customers, who can get free delivery within five days on a $25 minimum order.  At $3.99 per order, Target customers would have to place 75 orders to match the cost of Amazon’s annual $299 delivery fee for groceries.   Online groceries are a $10.9 billion industry in the United States, and the market is expected to grow 9.6 percent annually through 2019, according to a December report by market research firm IbisWorld. One of the largest players in the segment is Amazon Fresh, which delivers in Seattle, New York, Philadelphia, and northern and southern California.  Target’s grocery delivery pilot follows on a recent expansion of its curbside pick-up test, which started in San Francisco. With the partnership, Target joins an increasingly long list of companies using Instacart for last mile delivery, including Whole Foods Market Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp and most recently the H-E-B grocery chain in Texas.  Instacart does not hold inventory but picks up orders from the store and brings them to a customer’s home in as little as one hour.

678,TGT,"Target pharmacy workers form union, first in company's history","CHICAGO (Reuters) - A group of pharmacy workers within Target Corp’s store in Brooklyn, New York, have won a vote to form a microunion, making it the first unionized store at the retailer since its inception in 1902. Earlier on Wednesday, Reuters was first to report that a group of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians won an initial ballot, 7-2, to form the union, according to a filing on the National Labor Relations Board website and union officials. Target said it was “disappointed” by the vote within its store and will appeal the NLRB’s decision to allow the vote to proceed. Target is in the process of selling its pharmacy business to CVS Health Corp. “Because of the pending sale of the business, we don’t believe it was appropriate for the NLRB to move forward with the petition,” spokeswoman Molly Snyder told Reuters. “We believe it should have been dismissed and made that argument at the hearing.” The National Labor Relations Board in 2011 ruled that so-called micro unions are appropriate within a company’s operations when their members share “a community of interest.” That decision was upheld by a U.S. appeals court, spurring the board in 2014 to extend the standard to retail stores in a case involving fragrance and cosmetic department workers at Macy’s Inc. The National Retail Federation and other industry groups have said the decisions would wreak havoc on stores, pitting groups of employees against each other and forcing companies to negotiate with multiple unions that could have competing interests. Union groups say the NLRB ruling in favor of microunions is appropriate to the modern-day workplace, where employees often are asked to staff multiple departments. Target, which up until now has not had any unionized stores or microunions, said it twice previously has overcome serious attempts at unionization. The first occurred in Detroit in the 1990s, and the second came at its Valley Street store in New York City in 2011. “It is a big win for us,” said Lou Solicito, organizing director of the United Food and Commercial Workers union that supported the vote. “We are ready to bargain a contract with Target,” he said.

PayPal Holdings Inc, a leader in the fast-growing payment processing market, became a separate company on July 18. “The worst case scenario kind of came off the table,” said Steve Weinstein, a senior analyst at ITG Investment Research. “I think the Street was preparing for something really bad.” Instead, the company raised its forecast for adjusted profit from continuing operations for the full year to $1.80-$1.82 per share from $1.72-$1.77. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.78 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The increase reflects earnings performance in the second quarter as well as the repurchase of shares and a more favorable tax rate, Chief Financial Officer Scott Schenkel said on a call. EBay added a net 8 million new active buyers in the three months ended Sept. 30 compared with a year earlier. But while this was an increase of 5 percent, it was a far cry from the double-digit growth rates achieved until about two years ago. Ebay has had to work hard to win back user confidence after a security breach in May last year compromised the data of about 145 million customers. The company was also hurt by a change in Google’s algorithm, which pushed its results lower in search rankings. EBay’s net income fell to $539 million, or 45 cents per share, from $673 million, or 54 cents per share, a year earlier. However, excluding items the company earned 43 cents per share, beating the average estimate of 40 cents. Net revenue fell to $2.1 billion from $2.15 billion but was up about 5 percent after excluding changes in currency rates. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $2.09 billion. Gross merchandise volume fell 2 percent including the effect of currency but grew 6 percent on an forex-neutral basis. “We are not settling comfortably into a 5 percent or 6 percent growth rate. We are not satisfied with that,” a company executive said on the call. Up to Wednesday’s close of $24.21, eBay’s shares had fallen about 13 percent since July 17. PayPal’s shares dropped about 18 percent.

689,TGT,"Target to offer free U.S. shipping, strikes global shipping deal","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) said it will drop shipping fees for all online orders during the holiday shopping season for a second year in a row, ratcheting up competition with rivals including Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O).  The discount retailer also said it has struck a deal with Borderfree Inc to ship products to 200 countries and territories outside the United States during the holiday season. This comes as Target expands differentiated products and stylish merchandise at affordable prices to draw in its core customer base of middle-class shoppers. Last month, the retailer said it will price-match its largest rivals in-store and online. “Traffic is very important for us during the holidays and ... free shipping was very well received last year,” Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said on Thursday. He expects the shopping season to be driven by discounts to lure shoppers who remain cautious about making purchases. Target will offer free shipping for orders placed online from Nov. 1 to Dec. 25, he said. Target currently requires a minimum online order of $25 to qualify for free shipping. Wal-Mart has said it will keep its minimum online order size for free shipping at $50 this holiday season.  Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) will waive its $35 minimum through early January, while Amazon offers free delivery to members of its Prime shipping service. Target expects its ship-from-store program which it has recently expanded to 460 stores to become the real differentiator and speed up delivery times.  Growing digital sales, which were less than 3 percent of Target’s business through the first half of the year, has been a priority for Cornell. Free-shipping boosted Target’s digital sales 36 percent during the fourth quarter last year. Among other initiatives, Target said it will expand its online grocery delivery partnership with Instacart to six stores during the holidays from two currently.  It will also expand its curbside pickup service next week to 121 stores from 21 currently. Target will hire 1,400 associates to improve product presentation in its stores.

692,TGT,US retailers push banks to use PINs on credit cards as confusion reigns,"BOSTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) -    Some big U.S. retailers are stepping up efforts to use personal identification numbers, or PINs, with new credit cards embedded with computer chips in a bid to prevent counterfeit card fraud. But they are being resisted by the banking industry, which sees no need to invest further in PIN technology, already used with debit cards, resulting in halting adoption and widespread confusion. A small band of retailers with the clout to call the shots on their branded credit cards is leading the charge. Target Corp  is moving ahead with a chip-and-PIN rollout, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc plans to do the same. But Wal-Mart faces obstacles because its credit card partner, Synchrony Financial, is not yet able to handle PINs on credit cards. Broadly, U.S. banks are unprepared or resisting the change. The impasse comes after many consumers got their hands on new credit cards embedded with so-called EMV chips in advance of an Oct. 1 deadline that required retailers to accept chip cards or be liable for fraud losses. EMV stands for EuroPay, MasterCard and Visa. But only about a third of merchants are actually using the chip technology, according to analyst estimates. The number may not pick up until early next year, if at all, because the retail industry typically halts upgrades during the crucial holiday shopping season. “PIN issuance will remain a niche,” said Julie Conroy, credit-card analyst with Aite Group. Banks favor using chip cards verified by old-school signatures, even though chip-and-PIN usage has led to lower fraud over the decade they have been used in Europe and elsewhere. “The PIN is definitely a must,” said Lance James, chief scientist with cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint. “It’s one extra step that provides true two-factor authentication.” But bankers say PINs provide little benefit beyond the advantage of using chips in combating the estimated $7 billion-plus in annual U.S. card fraud. EMV chips thwart criminals who use stolen data to create counterfeit cards, a category that Aite estimates accounts for 37 percent of that fraud. Banks say that PINs only provide additional fraud protection when criminals seek to use lost or stolen cards, a situation that Aite estimates accounts for only 14 percent of fraud. Banking groups say there are better approaches than PINs for verifying customers and have asked retailers to embrace tokenization and encryption to prevent theft of credit card numbers. “PIN is a static data element that would not have a meaningful impact on overall payments fraud,” said Electronic Payments Coalition spokesman Sam Fabens. PINs are also expensive to implement. Gartner analyst Avivah Litan estimates that banks would have to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in network improvements to support them. Most retailers have yet to begin using any form of chip technology on credit cards, instead relying on the magnetic strips that are still part of the new cards, even though it now puts them on the hook for fraud losses. But some are pushing recalcitrant banks, arguing that it is absurd to require them to spend billions of dollars to upgrade their point-of-sale terminals if they are not going to get the added security of chip-and-PIN technology. “If they really cared about security, it would be a no-brainer,” to use PINs, said National Retail Federation General Counsel Mallory Duncan. The issue has caused some confusion, even among experts. A Chase credit card representative this month wrongly tweeted that the firm would soon issue chip and PIN credit cards. A company spokeswoman later said the tweet was a mistake. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation this month released a public service announcement incorrectly suggesting that all EMV credit cards use PINs, saying “Consumers should use the PIN, instead of a signature, to verify the transaction.” The agency updated the announcement to remove the error. So far only one PIN credit card is available through a major U.S. retailer, a MasterCard that Target issues through Toronto Dominion Bank. Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said her company recently began distributing PIN cards through a rollout that should be completed in the spring. “We believe that it is the most secure form of payment that is currently available,” Snyder said. Even though demands for PIN cards are being made by groups representing large retailers, some big merchants say they have no plans to offer PINs. “Our approach is chip and signature,” said Macy’s Inc  spokesman Jim Sluzewski. JC Penney Co Inc said it has no plans to introduce PINs and has yet to begin processing any chip transactions. An industry executive said that some retailers have privately confided that they fear widespread PIN adoption could result in slower lines and lost sales from shoppers who forget PINs. “They don’t want PINs because it clogs up transactions,” said the executive who declined to be named because the discussions were private.

693,TGT,Target loses latest round in effort to prevent pharmacy workers from forming union,"Nov 5 (Reuters) - Target Corp has lost another round in its attempt to prevent pharmacy workers at a New York City store forming what would be the first union in the retailer’s 113-year history after a U.S. labor agency declined to review its objections to the plan. In a single-sentence ruling on Wednesday, the National Labor Relations Board declined to review Target’s claim that board lawyers erred in approving the creation of the union because the company is in the process of selling its pharmacy operations to CVS Health Corp. A group of employees at one of Target’s stores in Brooklyn voted 7-2 in September to form the union, a local unit of United Food and Commercial Workers, after they won approval to have an election from an NLRB regional director in New York. The company also said the pharmacy workers should not have been able to form a so-called micro union that excluded other store employees. A Target representative said on Thursday the company was reviewing its options. The retailer could take the case to a U.S. appeals court, which would have the power to order the NLRB to reconsider the company’s arguments. In a 2011 decision, the labor board created a new standard for forming micro unions within a company’s operations, ruling  they are appropriate when their members share “a community of interest.” That decision was upheld by an Ohio-based U.S. appeals court, spurring the board to extend the standard to FedEx drivers, fragrance and cosmetic department workers at Macy’s Inc. and maintenance workers at a Nestle Dreyer’s Ice Cream plant, among others. Nestle last week asked a U.S. appeals court in Virginia to overturn the ruling in its case, as well as the board’s 2011 decision, which allowed nurses at a health care facility to form their own union. Trade groups backing Nestle, as well as FedEx in a similar case, say micro unions are a logistical nightmare for employers and could pit groups of workers against each other.",11052015,http://www.reuters.com/article/target-union/target-loses-latest-round-in-effort-to-prevent-pharmacy-workers-from-forming-union-idUSL1N13032E20151105

696,TGT,Target to start Black Friday deals five days early,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) said on Monday it will launch its Black Friday promotions five days early, with 10 days of deals on electronics, toys and apparel in stores and online starting Nov. 22.

700,TGT,UPDATE 3-Wal-Mart earnings beat expectations; shares up,"(New throughout, adds executive and analyst comments, updates share price) By Nathan Layne Nov 17 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc reported slightly stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings on Tuesday as it booked its fifth straight gain in U.S. same-store sales, sending its shares up more than 4 percent. However, the company also said it expected sales at stores open at least a year to grow more slowly during the current quarter, which includes the crucial holiday shopping season, and that business would remain competitive. Wal-Mart’s earnings have been under pressure from costs to boost entry-level wages and spruce up stores. Last month it warned that those costs would lead earnings to decline by as much as 12 percent next year, prompting many investors to dump the stock. The company has also said that those investments, while hitting profits, are also starting to translate into better customer service and helping to lift sales. “We are starting to get some good momentum,” Greg Foran, chief executive of U.S. operations, said on a call with reporters. Net profit attributable to the world’s largest retailer fell to $3.304 billion, or $1.03 per share, in the third quarter ended on Oct. 31 from $3.711 billion, or $1.15 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected 98 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The results included a boost of 4 cents a share from an adjustment of accounting for leases. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.5 percent, while customer traffic increased 1.7 percent. The company said food, apparel and home goods performed well, while its entertainment department struggled due in part to a lack of blockbuster products on the market to drive demand. Wal-Mart said inventory on a comparable store basis fell by 1.9 percent, a sharp contrast with Macy’s and other retailers that warned of a build-up of stock in recent weeks. In a note to clients, Cowen & Co analyst Oliver Chen wrote that Wal-Mart’s “clean inventory position” should somewhat limit promotional pressure among discounters during the holiday season. He also said Wal-Mart’s sales growth, driven by sales and apparel, should generally bode well for Target Corp, which reports quarterly results on Wednesday. Wal-Mart said operating income fell 8.8 percent to $5.7 billion. Foran said the company had added more labor hours than initially planned during the quarter while also making investments in customer-facing parts of the store. Wal-Mart said consolidated revenue fell 1.3 percent to $117.4 billion, weighed down by international operations, which have been hurt by a stronger dollar. It said online sales increased 10 percent in the quarter, slower than its plans for growth in the mid-to-high-teens this fiscal year. It cited weakness in Brazil, China and the U.K. The company forecast same-store U.S. sales growth would slow to 1 percent in the fourth quarter due to a tough comparison from last year when a big drop in fuel prices and food inflation boosted sales. Wal-Mart narrowed its forecast for earnings per share in the full fiscal year to end-January to $4.50 to $4.65 from $4.40 to $4.70. The market consensus was for $4.50. Shares of Wal-Mart were up 4.4 percent at $60.43 in morning trade.

701,TGT,Target's online sales growth slows; margins pressured,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) faces margin pressure and will not meet its fiscal-year forecast for online sales growth, which slowed in the latest quarter, the discount retailer said on Wednesday, sending its shares down more than 5 percent. Digital sales, which include online and mobile, increased 20 percent in the third quarter ended Nov. 1, missing Target’s expectations of 30 percent, Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith said. In March, the company said it expected a 40 percent rise for the year. “It’s clear that in 2015 we don’t expect to attain” the fiscal-year goal, Smith said on an earnings conference call. Target expects digital sales to grow 20 percent in the fourth quarter.  Smith attributed the slowdown to a double-digit decline in electronics sales, a category where Target offered “deep promotions” a year earlier.  Warm weather hurt digital and store sales of cold-weather clothing like coats and jackets, she said. Macy’s Inc (M.N) and Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) have reported similar problems. Target’s gross margins declined 9 basis points from a year earlier because of reimbursement pressure in its pharmacy operations, which it is selling to CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), and investments in its brands.  The fourth-largest U.S. retailer, which is in the midst of a turnaround plan, said growth in its “signature categories,” including items for children, babies and health and wellness, was 2.5 times faster than the company average in the third quarter ended on Nov. 1. Target raised the low end of its fiscal-year earnings forecast to $4.65 a share from $4.60. It kept the high end at $4.75. Excluding special items, earnings rose to 86 cents per share in the third quarter from 79 cents a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 85.9 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 2.1 percent to $17.61 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $17.57 billion.  Target said sales at stores open at least a year rose 1.9 percent, beating the market consensus of 1.7 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. The retailer expects comparable sales to grow 1 percent to 2 percent in the fourth quarter. Recently Target told Reuters it was considering partnerships with other companies to help shore up its fresh-food supply to eliminate chronic shortages on its shelves.

704,TGT,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-U.S. consumers and stores face off over depth of holiday discounts,"(Corrects company name to Market Track from MarketTrak in paragraphs 3, 7, 8) By Kylie Gumpert and Nandita Bose NEW YORK/CHICAGO, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Target Corp’s  10 percent discount on a $30.49 pair of embroidered curtains was not nearly enough to entice Valerie Jenkins, shopping in Chicago the weekend before Thanksgiving. She expects the 60-70 percent off she got during the last holidays. “There were some very good deals this time last year,” she said. Jenkins represents a problem for retailers going into what traditionally has been the peak shopping day of the holiday season, Black Friday. Big retailers are keeping discounts for the weekend following Thanksgiving at around the same level as last year, according to data supplied to Reuters by Market Track. But polls by Reuters/Ipsos and some others show shoppers, who got even bigger discounts closer to Christmas last year, are cautious with their spending and willing to wait for deals. The Reuters/Ipsos survey found more people planned to cut holiday spending than increase in every category surveyed: clothing, jewelry, electronics, food and toys, and that 46 percent felt they could wait longer in the season to buy because of faster shipping. Black Friday shopping will help set the tone for the rest of the holiday season, signaling to retailers whether they need to drop prices or change promotions. While Black Friday is not always a strong forecaster of holiday spending, last year reports of poor Black Friday spending were followed by deeper discounting and a rush of buying in the week before Christmas. J.C. Penney Co Inc offered an average 58 percent off in Black Friday ads this year, down from 59 percent last year, according to Market Track, which looks at circulars from top retailers. Kohl’s Corp is offering 54 percent off, up from 51 percent in 2014, and discounts from Staples Inc  and Office Depot are both a touch less than last year, at 45 percent and 50 percent, respectively. Appliances, entertainment items, infant products and hardware showed narrowing discounts, Market Track reported, while promotions for apparel, toys and electronics were getting bigger. Kurt Jetta, head of retail industry researcher TABS Group, found the discounts underwhelming. “The fact that retail has been so weak coming in to the season would suggest they may need to ramp up efforts to make up for this later,” Jetta said. Consumers were cautious going into the holidays, with sales at Macy’s, Nordstrom Inc and Best Buy  missing expectations in recent quarterly results. Target’s online sales fell due to a drop in demand for electronics. The Reuters/Ipsos survey of 4,639 adults from Nov. 12-23 found 28 percent of consumers expected discounts of 50 percent or more on most items, 36 percent hoped to see promotions of at least 33 percent while 49 percent expect a minimum discount of 20 percent on most products. A survey for Boston Consulting Group found 70 percent of consumers would spend the same or less as last year, describing the consumer outlook as “tepid.” Still, spending intentions are difficult to gauge and Gallup reported Americans plan to spend $830 on gifts this season, up from $720 a year ago at this time. The National Retail Federation expects holiday sales to rise 3.7 percent, slower than last year’s 4.1 percent growth rate, due to stagnant wages and sluggish job creation. Many retailers including Macy’s came into the season with high winter clothing inventory after warm weather in September and October, which also will increase discounting pressure. “Consumers have been trained to know that they can wait, and they will wait and that will force the retailers to continue to be promotional,” said Joel Bines, managing director at AlixPartners.

710,TGT,Target in $39.4 mln settlement with banks over data breach,"(Reuters) - Target Corp has agreed to pay $39.4 million to resolve claims by banks and credit unions that said they lost money because of the retailer’s late 2013 data breach. The settlement filed on Wednesday resolves class-action claims by lenders seeking to hold Target responsible for their costs to reimburse fraudulent charges and issue new credit and debit cards. Target has said at least 40 million credit cards were compromised in the breach, and that as many as 110 million people may have suffered the theft of personal information such as email addresses and phone numbers. The Minneapolis-based retailer has taken steps to avoid a recurrence, including being among the first U.S. retailers to install microchip-enabled card readers at all stores. Wednesday’s settlement calls for Target to pay as much as $20.25 million to banks and credit unions, and $19.11 million to reimburse MasterCard Inc card issuers. Target had reached a similar accord with MasterCard in April, but it was rejected the next month when card issuers deemed the sum too low. The settlement won preliminary approval from U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson in St. Paul, Minnesota, who called it “fair, reasonable and adequate,” court records showed. A hearing on final approval was scheduled for May 10, 2016. Earlier this year, Target agreed to pay Visa Inc card issuers as much as $67 million over the breach and reached a $10 million settlement with shoppers. The latter accord won court approval last month. Last week, Target said it has spent $290 million related to the breach, and expects insurers to reimburse $90 million. It still faces shareholder lawsuits, as well as probes by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general, over the breach. Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said the retailer is “pleased that the process is continuing to move forward.” The latest settlement covers all financial institutions that issued payment cards put at risk by the breach, and which did not previously release their claims against Target. Plaintiffs have included Umpqua Holdings Corp in Roseburg, Oregon; Mutual Bank in Whitman, Massachusetts; Village Bank in St. Francis, Minnesota; CSE Federal Credit Union in Lake Charles, Louisiana; and First Federal Savings of Lorain in Lorain, Ohio. Trade groups representing banks and credit unions have estimated that their members incurred more than $200 million of expenses related to the breach. “Financial institutions should not always have to bear the burden of extensive costs related to merchant data breaches over which they have no control,” the plaintiffs’ lawyers Charles Zimmerman and Karl Cambronne said in a joint statement. Target will also pay the plaintiffs’ legal fees, pending court approval, and will not appeal any sum of $20 million or less, court papers show.

715,TGT,SPECIAL REPORT-Buybacks enrich the bosses even when business sags,"(Part 2 in a series, “The Cannibalized Company: How the cult of shareholder value has reshaped corporate America) By Karen Brettell, David Gaffen and David Rohde NEW YORK, Dec 10(Reuters) - When health insurer Humana Inc reported worse-than-expected quarterly earnings in late 2014 - including a 21 percent drop in net income - it softened the blow by immediately telling investors it would make a $500 million share repurchase. In addition to soothing shareholders, the surprise buyback benefited the company’s senior executives. It added around two cents to the company’s annual earnings per share, allowing Humana to surpass its $7.50 EPS target by a single cent and unlocking higher pay for top managers under terms of the company’s compensation agreement. Thanks to Humana hitting that target, Chief Executive Officer Bruce Broussard earned a $1.68 million bonus for 2014. Most publicly traded U.S. companies reward top managers for hitting performance targets, meant to tie the interests of managers and shareholders together. At many big companies, those interests are deemed to be best aligned by linking executive performance to earnings per share, along with measures derived from the company’s stock price. But these metrics may not be solely a reflection of a company’s operating performance. They can be, and often are, influenced through stock repurchases. In addition to cutting the number of a company’s shares outstanding, and thus lifting EPS, buybacks also increase demand for the shares, usually providing a lift to the share price, which affects other performance markers. As corporate America engages in an unprecedented buyback binge, soaring CEO pay tied to short-term performance measures like EPS is prompting criticism that executives are using stock repurchases to enrich themselves at the expense of long-term corporate health, capital investment and employment. “We’ve accepted a definition of performance that is narrow and quite possibly inappropriate,” said Rosanna Landis Weaver, program manager of the executive compensation initiative at As You Sow, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit that promotes corporate responsibility. Pay for performance as it is often structured creates “very troublesome, problematic incentives that can potentially drive very short-term thinking.” A Reuters analysis of the companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index found that 255 of those companies reward executives in part by using EPS, while another 28 use other per-share metrics that can be influenced by share buybacks. In addition, 303 also use total shareholder return, essentially a company’s share price appreciation plus dividends, and 169 companies use both EPS and total shareholder return to help determine pay. EPS and share-price metrics underpin much of the compensation of some of the highest-paid CEOs, including those at Walt Disney Co, Viacom Inc, 21st Century Fox Inc, Target Corp and Cisco Systems Inc. Fewer than 20 of the S&P; 500 companies disclose in their proxies whether they exclude the impact of buybacks on per-share metrics that determine executive pay. Humana would not say whether it adjusted targets to account for its buyback last year. In a statement to Reuters, the company said it sets annual per-share targets for executives that take into account the company’s “capital allocation strategy,” which includes buybacks, dividends, acquisitions and investments. Experts said Humana would not have reached the target without the $500 million buyback. The company told analysts at the time of the repurchase announcement in November 2014 that it expected to report annual earnings per share of between $7.40 and $7.60 for the full year. “Given the magnitude of the repurchase, the EPS would have been below $7.50 had it not been for the repurchase,” said Heitor Almeida, a professor of finance with the College of Business at the University of Illinois in Champaign. As reported in the first article in this series, share buybacks by U.S. non-financial companies reached a record $520 billion in the most recent reporting year. A Reuters analysis of 3,300 non-financial companies found that together, buybacks and dividends have surpassed total capital expenditures and are more than double research and development spending. Companies buy back their shares for various reasons. They do it when they believe their shares are undervalued, or to make use of cash or cheap debt financing when business conditions don’t justify capital or R&D; spending. They also do it to meet the expectations of increasingly demanding investors. Lately, the sheer volume of buybacks has prompted complaints among academics, politicians and investors that massive stock repurchases are stifling innovation and hurting U.S. competitiveness - and contributing to widening income inequality by rewarding executives with ever higher pay, often divorced from a company’s underlying performance. “There’s been an over-focus on buybacks and raising EPS to hit share option targets, and we know that those are concentrated in the hands of the few, and that the few is in the top 1 percent,” said James Montier, a member of the asset allocation team at global investment firm GMO in London, which manages more than $100 billion in assets. The introduction of performance targets has been a driver of surging executive pay, helping to widen the gap between the richest in America and the rest of the country. Median CEO pay among companies in the S&P; 500 increased to a record $10.3 million last year, up from $8.6 million in 2010, according to data firm Equilar. At those levels, CEOs last year were paid 303 times what workers in their industries earned, compared with a ratio of 59 times in 1989, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based nonprofit. Today, the bulk of CEO compensation comes from cash and stock awards, much of it tied to performance metrics. Last year, base salary accounted for just 8 percent of CEO pay for S&P; 500 companies, while cash and stock incentives made up more than 45 percent, according to proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services. Thomson Reuters Corp, owner of Reuters News, used EPS to determine half of the performance awards in the three-year pay cycle ended in 2014 for CEO Jim Smith and other executives. Smith last year took home $6.6 million in compensation. The company’s three-year performance awards going forward are based on both EPS and free cash flow per share. A company spokesman said Thomson Reuters does not adjust for the impact of stock buybacks on those metrics. Share repurchases can make the difference in meeting preset targets, according to a Reuters review of corporate proxies. At Xerox Corp, revenue, net income and spending on research and development all declined last year. But the printer and copier maker’s EPS target of $1.12 was unchanged from the prior year, and managers hit it exactly after $1.1 billion in share repurchases. Half of CEO Ursula Burns’s annual bonus target was predicated on hitting that EPS level; ultimately, she received a bonus of $1.98 million out of a possible $2.2 million. EPS is also a major determinant of even bigger bonuses for a three-year performance cycle ending this year. Xerox repurchased $1.35 billion of its shares in the first three quarters of this year. The company declined to comment. Its proxy statement does not indicate whether it adjusts targets to account for buybacks. Managers at information technology company EMC Corp hit their EPS target for 2014 of $1.90 with the help of $3.7 billion in share repurchases. Based on the share count before the buybacks, EPS last year would have been only $1.81, little changed from $1.80 a year earlier, according to a Reuters calculation. The EPS target accounted for half of CEO Joseph Tucci’s annual $1.01 million bonus. It also is used to determine 45 percent of bonus share awards for the company’s future three-year targets. EMC declined to comment. Its proxy statement does not address whether it makes adjustments to account for buybacks. It has bought back $3.11 billion in shares so far this year. Buybacks can boost a company’s share price to benefit executives whose shares vest over a period of years. Activision Blizzard Inc, purveyor of “Guitar Hero,” “Call of Duty” and other well-known video games, signed Chief Executive Robert Kotick to a contract in 2012 that included $56 million in share awards that vest over time, depending in part on the share price and EPS. Last year, Kotick ended up getting about $22 million in performance-based cash and stock awards, about the same as the year prior, even as net income dropped 17 percent. How? The stock rose substantially, meeting goals for total shareholder return and increasing the value of share awards. Total shareholder return was helped by an $8.2 billion repurchase made in late 2013 - when the company and a group of investors led by Kotick and Activision Chairman Brian Kelly bought out a stake held by then-majority shareholder Vivendi. The company said the deal allowed Activision to operate with more flexibility. The shares rose 33 percent from the date of the buyback announcement in July 2013 through the end of 2014. The share price has continued to rise this year, making the awards even more valuable. Activision declined to comment. In 1992, Congress changed the tax code to curb rising executive pay and encourage performance-based compensation. It didn’t work. Instead, the shift is widely blamed for soaring executive pay and a heavier emphasis on short-term results. Companies started tying performance pay to “short-term metrics, and suddenly all the things we don’t want to happen start happening,” said Lynn Stout, a professor of corporate and business law at Cornell Law School in Ithaca, New York. “Despite 20 years of trying, we have still failed to come up with an objective performance metric that can’t be gamed.” Shareholder expectations have changed, too. The individuals and other smaller, mostly passive investors who dominated equity markets during the postwar decades have given way to large institutional investors. These institutions tend to want higher returns, sooner, than their predecessors. Consider that the average time investors held a particular share has fallen from around eight years in 1960 to a year and a half now, according to New York Stock Exchange data. Companies like to use EPS as a performance metric because it is the primary focus of financial analysts when assessing the value of a stock and of investors when evaluating their return on investment. But “it is not an appropriate target, it’s too easy to manipulate,” said Almeida, the University of Illinois finance professor. In 2011, Amgen Inc CEO Kevin Sharer oversaw $8.32 billion of buybacks, by far the largest in the pharmaceutical maker’s history. More than $5 billion of those repurchases came in the fourth quarter of the year. Soon after, Amgen reported that net income was lower than it had been in the three preceding years. At the same time, the buybacks lifted EPS far above the target level that determined 30 percent of Sharer’s bonus, doubling the amount he earned for that portion of his $4.88 million annual bonus. Without the buyouts, EPS would have fallen below the target level. Sharer left the company in May 2012 and is now on the faculty of Harvard Business School. He did not respond to requests for comment. The Amgen board’s compensation committee removed EPS as a performance metric the next year. It opted, instead, to begin using net income, saying in a 2012 proxy statement that doing so would “align compensation with a measure that more directly correlates with the underlying performance of our operations.” Members of Amgen’s 2011 compensation committee declined to comment. Some companies, including software developer Citrix Systems Inc and kidney dialysis company DaVita Inc, say they avoid EPS in pay calculations because it is too vulnerable to manipulation. Most companies that use per-share metrics for executive awards, however, say little about whether they adjust results to account for buybacks. A select few, including Johnson & Johnson, FedEx, Time Warner Inc and IBM, do disclose that they strip out the potential effect of buybacks on performance metrics. FedEx, in its most recent filing, said it excluded the effect of buybacks because the positive effect on EPS “did not reflect core business performance.” Time Warner Inc said it adjusts for buybacks “so that payouts were not advantaged” if the media company repurchased more shares than it initially anticipated when setting performance goals. Steve Pakela, managing partner at Pay Governance LLC in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which advises more than 40 S&P; 500 companies on executive pay, said some directors “believe you shouldn’t strip out the effect” because share buybacks may be the best use of capital. In addition to EPS, there is total shareholder return, which typically comprises a company’s share price appreciation plus dividends over time. Total return, often used to compare performance among peer companies, has also become a popular performance measure for executive pay. By providing a lift to a stock’s price, buybacks can increase total shareholder return to target levels, resulting in more stock awards for executives. And of course, the higher stock price lifts the value of company stock they already own. “It can goose the price at time when the high price means they earn performance shares  even if the stock price later goes back down, they got their shares,” said Michael Dorff, a law professor at the Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles. Exxon Corp, the largest repurchaser of shares over the past decade, has rejected shareholder proposals that it add three-year targets based on shareholder return to its compensation program. In its most recent proxy, the energy company said doing so could increase risk-taking and encourage underinvestment to achieve short-term results. The energy giant makes half of its annual executive bonus payments contingent on meeting longer-term EPS thresholds. Since 2005, the company has spent more than $200 billion on buybacks. While performance targets are specific, they aren’t necessarily fixed. Corporate boards often adjust them or how they are calculated in ways that lift executive pay. Humana specifies EPS ranges to determine annual bonuses paid to its executives. For the past three years, buybacks of more than $500 million a year increased EPS. That wasn’t all, however. For each of those years, the board altered calculations in ways that also bumped EPS higher. For 2012, then-CEO Michael McCallister received a higher bonus than he otherwise would have — $1.63 million — after Humana’s board removed litigation expenses from its EPS calculation. He was succeeded as CEO at the start of 2013 by Broussard. For that year, Broussard’s annual bonus was lifted into the maximum range, for a payment $2.44 million, after accounting for the cost of posting additional reserves against long-term insurance policies. For 2014, Humana discounted from its EPS calculation losses from paying down some bonds, even as its overall debt levels increased. That adjustment brought the company just below its EPS target of $7.50. The $500 million buyback the company announced late last year, part of its total $872 million in buybacks in 2014, was an accelerated share repurchase. In this sort of deal, a company buys all the stock from an investment bank in a single transaction. That allows it to book the reduction in shares outstanding immediately, and the bank then buys the shares on the open market over the ensuing months. Humana’s accelerated share repurchase lifted EPS to $7.51, just above the target. Susan Young, an associate professor of accounting and taxation at Fordham University in New York, said accelerated buybacks are commonly used to reach compensation targets. “I can’t think of a good reason for this form of repurchase,” she said, noting that the programs restrict a company’s flexibility to reduce or stop buybacks if shares become too expensive. Roy Dunbar, a member of the Humana board’s compensation committee, declined to comment on Humana specifically. He said the benefit of accelerated repurchases is to, “in a controlled way, buy a significant slice of available shares early in the program,” before an announced buyback pushes up the share price and increases the cost to the company. He also said an accelerated program allows shareholders to see immediate action, which is “important to signal a higher degree of confidence in something shareholders care a great deal about.” In general, he said, “effective compensation committees are aware of impact of share repurchases on EPS, particularly when EPS is part of the equity compensation of management.” In July, Aetna Inc announced that it would acquire Humana in a deal that at the time valued Humana at $37 billion. If Broussard leaves after the deal, he won’t go empty-handed. Just before the Aetna deal was announced, Broussard’s compensation agreement was modified to accelerate equity awards and remove restrictions on exercising some stock options if he leaves or is terminated within two years of any acquisition, a regulatory filing shows. At the end of last year, Broussard held unvested share awards valued at around $12.8 million, which have since increased in value as Humana’s share price has climbed 18 percent.

716,TGT,UPDATE 3-Newell Rubbermaid to buy Jarden to create consumer durables giant,"* Deal valued at $15.4 bln on fully diluted basis * Combination to help negotiations with big retailers * Newell Brands to have total sales of about $16 bln * Jarden shares trade well below $60/share offer   (Adds details, analysts comment; updates shares) By Yashaswini Swamynathan Dec 14 (Reuters) - Newell Rubbermaid Inc, known for its food containers, agreed to buy Sunbeam and Coleman products maker Jarden Corp for more than $15 billion in a deal that will give it more leverage with retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The deal announced on Monday comes amid growing pressure for retailers to hold down prices as they compete with online players such as Amazon.com Inc. Reuters reported in October that Wal-Mart, which provides nearly 13 percent of Newell Rubbermaid’s revenue, was asking suppliers to cut prices. The deal, while primarily aimed at accelerating growth, will make it easier for Newell to fend off demands for price cuts, Neil Saunders, chief executive of research firm Conlumino, told Reuters. Based on 220.35 million Jarden shares outstanding as of Oct. 30, the deal has a value of $13.22 billion. However, Newell Rubbermaid said that on a fully diluted basis the offer was valued at $15.4 billion. The combined company, to be called Newell Brands, will have annual sales of $16 billion. Newell Brands’ revenue from Wal-Mart is expected to be more than 2.6 times Newell Rubbermaid’s 2014 revenue from the retailer, the Newell Rubbermaid said in an investor presentation, while revenue from Target Corp stores is expected to be 1.9 times bigger. From Amazon, revenue is expected to grow by 1.8 times after the deal closes in the second quarter of 2016. The deal - which gives Newell Rubbermaid ownership of more than 120 Jarden brands, including Yankee Candle, Crock-Pot cookware and class rings maker Jostens Inc - will also significantly increase its U.S. distribution network. Newell Brands will be led by Newell Rubbermaid Chief Executive Michael Polk. Martin Franklin, Jarden’s founder and executive chairman, will be on the board. Jarden shareholders will receive $21 in cash and 0.862 Newell shares for each share held, implying a $60 per share offer. The offer is at a 24 percent premium to Jarden’s closing stock price on Dec. 4, the day before reports emerged that the company was in talks to combine with Newell. Jarden’s shares were up 1 percent at $53.30 in early afternoon trading, far below the offer price, while Newell’s stock was down 10.5 percent at $40.51. Analysts attributed the gap between the offer price and  Jarden’s shares to disappointment in the premium and the exclusion of Franklin from an executive role in the new company. Newell Rubbermaid shareholders will own about 55 percent of Newell Brands. The companies said they expected to realize cost savings of $500 million in the four years after the transaction closes. Goldman Sachs was lead financial adviser to Newell Rubbermaid, while Centerview Partners advised the board. Barclays was the lead financial adviser to Jarden, with UBS Investment Bank also advising. Jones Day and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett provided legal counsel to Newell Rubbermaid, while Greenberg Traurig LLP and Kane Kessler PC were legal advisers to Jarden.

717,TGT,Exclusive: Target in initial development of own mobile wallet - sources,"(Reuters) - Target Corp is in the early stages of developing its own mobile wallet, three people familiar with the matter said, joining Wal-Mart Stores Inc in posing a threat to recent entrants like Apple Pay. The fourth-largest U.S. retailer has not committed to launch the product, which would allow customers to pay for goods using an app on their mobile phones. The mobile wallet could launch as early as next year, but it is too early to predict, said two of the sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Target’s team has made some decisions, including to partner  with credit card companies, and they are in favor of processing transactions using scanning technology to communicate with payment terminals, the two sources said. However, Target has not tested the wallet in its stores so far, said the third source, who was not authorized to disclose the details. Target’s entry would create a powerful new competitor in a small, crowded market, challenging Apple Inc’s Apple Pay, Alphabet Inc’s Android Pay and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd’s Samsung Pay.   Target’s move also would raise new questions about the viability of a plan by a number of retailers, including Target and Wal-Mart, to create a joint mobile wallet, called CurrentC. Target spokesman Eddie Baeb said on Friday the retailer is testing CurrentC, which is being developed by the Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX), in a few stores but it is also exploring additional mobile wallet solutions. He declined to comment on whether Target was developing its own mobile payment service. “Target is a participant of the MCX and we are testing its CurrentC mobile wallet with guests as part of a pilot in Columbus, Ohio,” Baeb said. Mobile wallets have struggled to find favor with merchants and customers, with many shoppers not finding the new systems worth the trouble to activate for every purchase.  Still, wallet companies are cramming into the space in the expectation that consumers eventually will choose to pay with phones and that winning vendors will forge deep, profitable links with customers.  CurrentC’s aim was to become competitive with credit cards while reducing the fees retailers pay to card companies.  Last week, Wal-Mart became the first member of the group to announce its own mobile payment service, Wal-Mart Pay.  Wal-Mart said it would remain part of the CurrentC consortium and the sources said Target planned to as well.    The urgency by Wal-Mart and Target to jump into the mobile payments space stems from the delays in CurrentC’s rollout and the need to remain ahead in the payments business, industry experts said.    Target does not accept any type of mobile wallet in stores, but takes Apple Pay in its mobile application.     The Minneapolis-based retailer is planning to integrate its wallet into its existing mobile application and does not intend to employ the wireless near-field communication technology used by the likes of Apple Pay and Android Pay, one of the sources added.    It is leaning toward using QR code technology, used by Starbucks Corp and Wal-Mart, which allows customers to scan a code at the payment terminal, the sources said.    Like Wal-Mart, Target aims to directly link customers’ credit cards to its payment app, they added.    Target’s mobile wallet is not likely to bypass credit card companies. The retailer is looking for ways to integrate its Red store credit and debit cards, as well as cards from other issuers, the sources said.    Gregory Burch, vice president of strategic initiatives at payment terminal manufacturer Ingenico, said given the proliferation of mobile payment services, retailers have to make it worthwhile for shoppers to use their mobile wallets in stores. “It is crucial these retailers are able to build (customer) habit,” he said.

719,TGT,UPDATE 6-Lowe's wins over Canada's Rona with renewed takeover offer,"(Reuters) - U.S. home improvement retailer Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) agreed to buy Canada’s Rona Inc RON.TO for C$3.2 billion ($2.28 billion), winning over Rona’s board with a far higher offer than an unsolicited bid more than three years ago that was opposed by the company and Quebec politicians. The deal will put Lowe’s in a stronger position to compete with Home Depot Inc (HD.N) in Canada’s more-than $30 billion home improvement market. Lowe’s, which withdrew a C$1.8 billion offer for Rona in September 2012, said on Wednesday it had made key commitments, including moving the headquarters of its Canadian business from Toronto to Rona’s home base in the Montreal suburb of Boucherville, Quebec. It also said it would retain the vast majority of Rona’s employees, keep the brand and ramp up distribution to independent dealers, many of whom had opposed the previous deal. Lowe’s previous attempt to take over Rona became a hot-button issue in Quebec. Quebec’s economic development minister said it would not be in the interest of the Liberal government to block the new deal, despite a call from the opposition Parti Québécois to reject it. Asked on a call with analysts why Lowe’s had made a new offer, Chief Executive Robert Niblock said Rona was “a much better business today.” After years of disappointing sales, Rona has been closing unprofitable stores and generally streamlining operations under Chief Executive Robert Sawyer. Sales at established stores have risen five quarters in a row. Lowe’s push into Canada comes a year after Target Corp (TGT.N) exited the country after less than two years due to supply chain and other issues. The big difference is that Lowe’s is buying an established business, while Target was largely starting from scratch. Lowe’s, the world’s No. 2 home improvement chain, had only 40 of its 1,850 North America stores in Canada as of March. Rona has about 700 stores. Home Depot has 182 Canadian stores, its website shows. Lowe’s will pay C$24 per share for Rona’s common shares - more than double the stock’s close on Tuesday. Rona’s largest shareholder, Quebec public pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, said it would accept the offer. The Caisse holds about 17 percent of Rona, Thomson Reuters data shows. BMO Capital Markets analyst Peter Sklar said the deal would likely win regulatory approval. Rona’s shares were trading as high as $C23.57 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, their highest since July 2007. Lowe’s shares were down nearly 8 percent at $66.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.

720,TGT,Target comp sales beat shows turnaround efforts gaining traction,"(Reuters) - Target Corp’s (TGT.N) quarterly sales at established stores topped analysts’ estimates as its initiatives around higher-profit items drove traffic, showing that the company’s turnaround efforts under CEO Brian Cornell were gaining traction. The U.S. retailer, whose shares rose as much as 4 percent to $76.95, also forecast a higher-than-expected adjusted profit for the full year. Same-store sales at rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) missed market expectations last week, hurt by a strong dollar and sluggish apparel demand. Target’s apparel sales rose in the fourth quarter, in contrast to weak sales at several retailers including Ralph Lauren Corp (RL.N) and Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N). Cornell, Target’s chief executive since August 2014, has been aggressively trying to turnaround the company after several years of sluggish growth. Some of his efforts include promoting and investing in a narrower set of higher-margin “signature” categories such as baby and health and wellness, and pulling out of Canada. Comparable sales in higher-margin categories rose by more than three times the company average in the quarter ended Jan. 30, Target said, with  women’s apparel, wearable electronics and food being the fastest growing. “Signs that CEO Cornell’s strategic initiatives are gaining traction include: ‘signature’ categories re-accelerating to about 6 percent growth and traffic rising 1.3 percent,” Sterne Agee analyst Renato Basanta said. Apparel sales were helped by better in-store and online presentation and the stocking of trendier styles, Target finance chief Cathy Smith said on a media call. “We believe that Target performed somewhat above the market (in apparel) thanks to its more fashion-savvy shopper demographic and its strong marketing efforts around holiday looks,” Neil Saunders, CEO of research firm Conlumino, wrote in a note. Concerns about a slowdown in Target’s digital sales were also alleviated by its 34 percent growth in the quarter, Sterne Agee’s Basanta said, terming it “solid progress for Target’s still nascent platform.” The concerns stem from Target’s warning in November that it would miss its target of growing online sales by 40 percent in 2015 due to slowing electronic sales. Sales at Target stores open at least 13 months increased 1.9 percent in the quarter, beating the 1.5 percent rise analysts had expected. Excluding items, Target earned $1.52 per share, missing the average estimate by 2 cents, due to promotions. Total sales fell 0.6 percent to $21.63 billion, mainly due to the sale of its pharmacy business to CVS Health Corp (CVS.N). Analysts had expected sales to remain flat.

724,TGT,"Target to invest billions to improve supply chain, ramp up online growth","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) said on Wednesday it will invest $2-$2.5 billion annually starting 2017, mainly to upgrade its supply chain and technology infrastructure, as it races to reduce stock shortages and pushes for online growth. Target blamed its “incredibly complex supply chain” for unacceptable stock levels in 2015 that hurt sales growth at established stores. Now, among other initiatives, it is cutting the number of sizes and brands it stocks to address the problem. Ramping up online sales growth and fixing the supply chain are priorities in the turnaround plan presented by Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell in 2015 to revive the company after several years of sluggish growth. In 2016, Target will invest $1.8 billion primarily towards similar improvements, after investing about $1 billion in upgrading its supply network and technology in 2015, the company said on Wednesday. “We laid out a bold multi-year transformation agenda last March..and we’ll be laser focused on those initiatives in 2016,” Cornell told a meeting of analysts in New York. Since taking over in July 2014, Cornell has narrowed the retailer’s focus to a handful of product categories where Target believed it has an edge on quality and price. He has pushed to revamp the retailer’s grocery business with newer offerings, driven online growth and overhauled Target’s archaic and complicated supply chain.  He has also outlined cost savings plans, cut thousands of jobs and pulled out of Canada. His efforts have slowly started to pay off.

725,TGT,"UPDATE 2-Target to invest billions to improve supply chain, ramp up online growth","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) said on Wednesday it will invest $2-$2.5 billion annually starting 2017, mainly to upgrade its supply chain and technology infrastructure, as it races to reduce stock shortages and pushes for online growth. Target blamed its “incredibly complex supply chain” for unacceptable stock levels in 2015 that hurt sales growth at established stores. Now, among other initiatives, it is cutting the number of sizes and brands it stocks to address the problem. Ramping up online sales growth and fixing the supply chain are priorities in the turnaround plan presented by Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell in 2015 to revive the company after several years of sluggish growth. In 2016, Target will invest $1.8 billion primarily towards similar improvements, after investing about $1 billion in upgrading its supply network and technology in 2015, the company said on Wednesday. “We laid out a bold multi-year transformation agenda last March..and we’ll be laser focused on those initiatives in 2016,” Cornell told a meeting of analysts in New York. Since taking over in July 2014, Cornell has narrowed the retailer’s focus to a handful of product categories where Target believed it has an edge on quality and price. He has pushed to revamp the retailer’s grocery business with newer offerings, driven online growth and overhauled Target’s archaic and complicated supply chain.  He has also outlined cost savings plans, cut thousands of jobs and pulled out of Canada. His efforts have slowly started to pay off. Target’s stock shortages were 40 percent lower during the holiday season compared to last year, the company reported a better-than-expected comparable sales growth and a 34 percent increase in online sales growth.

727,TGT,Amazon sues veteran exec hired by Target,"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) has sued a former executive hired by Target Corp (TGT.N) as its chief supply chain and logistics officer to prevent him from revealing trade secrets. Amazon said in the lawsuit that the former employee, Arthur Valdez, was in violation of a noncompetition agreement that he signed while working for the company.  The lawsuit said his new role in Target would breach the agreement, which required him to not engage in competition with Amazon for 18 months after leaving the company. Amazon claims Valdez, whose appointment was announced by Target in February, was privy to confidential information in a highly competitive area for both companies - moving and shipping goods in the most effective manner. Valdez had been president of operations at Amazon, focusing on the company’s international supply chain expansion. The lawsuit did not specify when Valdez left Amazon. However, Valdez’s attorney informed Amazon that he would start at Target on March 28, according to the lawsuit. “We have taken significant precautions to ensure that any proprietary information remains confidential and we believe this suit is without merit,” Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said.",3222016,http://www.reuters.com/article/amazon-lawsuit/amazon-sues-veteran-exec-hired-by-target-idUSL2N16U1IT
728,TGT,UPDATE 1-Amazon sues veteran exec hired by Target,"(Adds information on exec’s background, context) By Mari Saito and Anya George Tharakan SAN FRANCISCO, March 22 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc  has sued a veteran logistics executive hired by Target Corp  as its chief supply chain and logistics officer to prevent him from revealing trade secrets. Amazon said in the lawsuit filed this week that the former employee, Arthur Valdez, was in violation of a noncompetition agreement that he signed while working for the company. (bit.ly/1UL793S) Valdez spent 16 years at Amazon as a senior executive in the Seattle-based retailer’s operations department overseeing the company’s international supply chain expansion. Target and other major brick and mortar retailers are aggressively investing in their ecommerce businesses as they try to catch up with Amazon, which revolutionized online retail through aggressive pricing and speedy delivery. In announcing his hiring in February, Target touted Valdez’ experience, calling him a “seasoned supply chain leader” who was focused on Amazon’s international supply chain expansion. The lawsuit said his new role as the chief supply chain and logistics officer at Target would breach Valdez’ noncompete agreement with Amazon, which required him to not engage in competition with Amazon for 18 months after leaving the company. Amazon claims that Valdez was privy to confidential information in a highly competitive area for both companies - moving and shipping goods in the most effective manner. In its suit, Amazon said the agreement it signed with Valdez prevents him from disclosing confidential information on Amazon’s future plans. Amazon also said Valdez was part of an executive level review last year of multiple business divisions including Amazon Fresh, the company’s grocery service, and Prime Now, which offers one and two-hour deliveries. Target is pushing to revamp its food business with newer offerings and  aims to get a bigger slice of online grocery sales, which will put new pressures on its food supply chain. Target has lagged behind competitors in e-commerce, but is now stepping up its emphasis on such sales. Recently, the company signed a deal with online delivery service Instacart to pick up Target groceries and deliver them to customers in some cities. The lawsuit did not specify when Valdez left Amazon. However, Valdez’s attorney informed Amazon that he would start at Target on March 28, according to the lawsuit. “We have taken significant precautions to ensure that any proprietary information remains confidential and we believe this suit is without merit,” Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said.

729,TGT,Lawsuit accuses Target of not paying overtime to some warehouse workers,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) has been accused in a lawsuit of failing to pay overtime to workers with low-level management responsibilities at its warehouses in New York state.     The lawsuit, which seeks class action status, accuses the retailer of violating state labor law by misclassifying “operations group leaders” as exempt from overtime requirements and not paying them for all hours worked.     Target was sued six months after the Obama administration proposed making nearly 5 million more U.S. workers eligible for overtime pay.     That proposal, which is being reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget, is widely expected to narrow an exemption for white-collar workers from overtime pay protections based on the percentage of time they spend on management tasks.     Target “controls very carefully what the group leaders do such that they are not left with meaningful executive authority that would satisfy exemption under the law,” Jahan Sagafi, a lawyer for the named plaintiff, Robert LaPointe Jr, told Reuters.     Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said Target’s distribution center group leaders are properly classified as exempt, salaried team members and said these department leaders hire, manage and lead teams of up to 50 people.  “They are competitively compensated and rewarded for their performance. We dispute the allegations in the suit,” she said.    Sagafi said the lawsuit may expand to cover Target’s activity in other states.     He did not say how many potential plaintiffs might be covered, but the complaint said more than 40 group leaders in New York state might be covered.     Target is overhauling its supply chain infrastructure. Earlier this month, the retailer said it will invest $2 billion to $2.5 billion annually starting in 2017, mainly to upgrade its supply network and technology infrastructure, as it races to reduce stock shortages and pushes for online growth.

732,TGT,Walgreens' Wall Street edge fades against rival CVS as earnings near,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - For much of the last three years, investors have been willing to pay more for expected profit at Walgreens than for competitor CVS, but the pharmacy chain may be losing that edge on Wall Street. Analysts are now putting much more favorable ratings on CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), and CVS shares are outrunning Walgreens so far this year and closing the valuation gap. When Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) reports fiscal second-quarter results on Tuesday, it could win converts. The company is expected to report earnings of $1.28 per share, up 8 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken rates both stocks as “buys,” but said that most investors choose between the companies, with Walgreens now representing a higher-risk, higher-reward play, and CVS the lower-risk stock as Walgreens undergoes changes under a new CEO.  Perhaps reflecting the view that CVS is a safer bet, a greater portion of analysts are recommending its shares, with 85 percent placing “buy” or “strong buy” ratings on the stock against 58 percent for Walgreen, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Walgreens shares are trading at 18 times forward earnings estimates compared with 17.4 times for CVS. But that gap has been wider for most of the past year. With a market cap of about $93 billion, Walgreens has established itself as a massive international retailer and distributor after completing the acquisition of Europe’s Alliance Boots more than a year ago. That company’s former executive chairman, Stefano Pessina, was named to head Walgreens on a permanent basis last July. Well-regarded by investors, Pessina has been leading changes that include significant cost cutting, according to analysts. Meanwhile, uncertainty clouds Walgreens’ latest big deal - its proposed $9.4 billion acquisition of Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N), which would expand its U.S. drugstore footprint but faces antitrust scrutiny. Seattle-based Smead Capital Management holds more than 860,000 Walgreens shares and views the company as a “best in class player” in operating pharmacy outlets and convenience stores, said Tony Scherrer, Smead’s director of research. CVS has also been on the acquisition path, with recent deals for pharmacy services provider Omnicare and Target Corp’s (TGT.N) fleet of pharmacies. CVS, with a market cap of about $115 billion, is one of the biggest U.S. managers of prescription benefits - a business in which Walgreens lacks a comparable big presence - in addition to being the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain by sales behind Walgreens, according to Euromonitor. That pharmacy benefits business, which has been increasing revenue at a faster pace than the pharmacy side, gives CVS an edge, said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds in Rye, New York, who prefers CVS shares to Walgreens.  CVS should also merit a higher stock market value, he said, because deals in the pharmacy benefits, or PBM, industry have been struck at higher premiums than for drug-store mergers. “I just think with the PBM in particular, (CVS is) going to have a much better growth rate in both revenue and earnings,” Jonas said.

733,TGT,Target Australia chief resigns amid probe into rebate scheme,"SYDNEY, April 8 (Reuters) - The managing director of Wesfarmers Ltd’s Target department stores, Stuart Machin, resigned on Friday amid an investigation into whether the retailer inflated earnings by bringing forward supplier rebates. Machin denied involvement in the scheme to boost Target’s first-half profit by seeking extra rebates from some 30  suppliers in return for promises of price rises in the second half. However, he said it was time to go. “Latterly, I have been dismayed to learn of the accounting issues at the half year,” Machin said in a statement released by Wesfarmers. “I was not aware of these, but they happened on my watch and as managing director I accept my share of the responsibility,” he said. “The right thing is now for me to move on”. In December, Wesfarmers announced Machin was shifting from his position as Target’s managing director to a yet-to-be-identified senior executive role in July. A Wesfarmers spokeswoman would not comment on earlier press reports that the rebates helped boost Target’s first-half earnings by around 25 percent. The retailer’s fiscal 2016 first-half earnings before interest and tax rose 5.7 percent to A$74 million ($55.84 million). Wesfarmers has accepted Machin’s resignation which comes as an internal investigation into the rebates nears completion, according to the spokeswoman.

735,TGT,Target increases minimum wage to $10 an hour -sources,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Discount retailer Target Corp  has started raising employee wages to a minimum of $10 an hour, its second hike in a year, pressured by a competitive job market and labor groups calling for higher wages at retail chains, sources said. Target management has informed store managers, who in turn have started informing employees about the wage hike and most employees who earn less than $10 per hour should see their base pay go up in May, two sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters. The $1-per-hour raise marks the second time Target has followed Wal-Mart Stores Inc in raising base wages. It also comes as a union-led push for a $15 minimum wage, the so-called “Fight for Fifteen” movement, is gaining traction in cities across the country and even has become a topic in the U.S. presidential campaign, with Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders calling for a $15 “living wage.” Target’s decision reflects growing competition for workers in an increasingly strong labor market. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits has fallen to its lowest point in 42-1/2-years, and the jobless rate is only 5.0 percent. Target last raised its minimum pay rate in April 2015 to $9 an hour, up from the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour at the time. The move last April matched a similar announcement by Wal-Mart. The world’s largest retailer in February 2015 said it will lift its base pay to $10 an hour in 2016, a step it has implemented in recent weeks. Target’s plan will also raise pay for employees who already make over $10 an hour. Such workers will be entitled to an annual merit raise and a pay-grade hike, which is related to experience and position of the employee, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media. Target declined to confirm it is offering the pay increase. “We pay market competitive rates and regularly benchmark the marketplace to ensure that our compensation and benefits packages will help us to both recruit and retain great talent, Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said. Snyder said the company does not disclose details of its compensation programs and declined to comment on how many of the retailer’s roughly 341,000 employees at its nearly 1,800 stores would receive the raise. The move to $10 an hour could put pressure on Target’s earnings, especially at a time when Target is investing billions to upgrade its supply chain and technology infrastructure in order to tackle chronic stock shortages. Target also is pushing for higher online sales, which could potentially explain why it has lagged its larger rival in setting the lead on wage increases, analysts said. “This move will make it difficult for Target to meet its aggressive profit projections,” said Burt Flickinger, managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group. At its 2016 Analyst Day in March, Target said it expects annual gross margin rates around 30 percent. Even before the wage hike, Barclays Capital Inc last month had downgraded the stock from ‘overweight’ to ‘underweight.’ At the time, Barclays analysts called the retailer’s gross margin projections “optimistic” due to the threat of rising labor costs and other concerns. Of the 26 analysts who cover the stock, 11 rate it a “buy,” and 13 rate it a “hold,” according to data from Thomson Reuters StarMine. Target, which generally is considered to be a better employer due to its competitive wages and compensation-related benefits than many retail rivals, has in recent months seen a spate of labor-related issues. Last September, Target lost a bid to prevent the formation of a micro-union by pharmacy workers in a New York store, which would have marked the first time Target employed unionized workers in one of its stores. Target later sold its pharmacy business to CVS Health Corp. Then earlier this month, a Target group leader filed a lawsuit accusing the company of failing to pay overtime to workers with low-level management responsibilities at its warehouses in New York state. Current and former employees contacted by Reuters this month said the retailer cut hours in an apparent effort to offset the impact of rising costs after it raised pay to $9 an hour last March. Target’s Snyder said the retailer has not changed how it approaches scheduling and hours in its stores. A current part-time employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity as she was not authorized to speak to the media, said she averaged about 25-26 hours every week before March 2015,  but has progressively seen her hours cut. She now averages at about 18-19 hours per week. ",4182016,http://www.reuters.com/article/target-wages/target-increases-minimum-wage-to-10-an-hour-sources-idUSL2N17L1QH

Shares of the home improvement chain, which also raised its profit forecast for the year ending Feb. 3, rose as much as 4 percent to a record high of $79.08, boosting the company’s market value by about $2.5 billion. In contrast, Home Depot’s shares fell as much as 3 percent after reporting results on Tuesday, as investors viewed the stock as fairly valued following a more than 19 percent gain in the 12 months to Monday’s close. Lowe’s stock rose only 5 percent in the period.  Investors had been relatively negative on Lowe’s stock prior to the earnings and the stock was “cheap” compared to the past three years, J.P. Morgan analyst Christopher Horvers wrote. The outlook for the home-improvement industry remained positive for the rest of the year as gains in the job market and disposable income drive consumer spending, Chief Executive Robert Niblock said on a conference call on Wednesday. U.S. housing starts rose a stronger-than-expected 6.6 percent in April, data showed on Tuesday. Rising home prices were also encouraging consumers to invest in their houses, Niblock added. “The home improvement industry once again shows its resilient nature in an increasingly more difficult environment for retailers,” Horvers wrote. Retailers such as Macy’s Inc (M.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N) reported quarterly sales that missed Wall Street’s estimates as consumer spending shifts away from apparel and accessories to big-ticket items including cars and homes. Separately, New York’s Attorney General Eric Schneiderman reached a settlement with Lowe’s and Home Depot over alleged violations of a 2010 state law designed to reduce water pollution. The attorney general alleged that 90 percent of Home Depot and Lowe’s stores in New York violated the law by displaying phosphorus-containing lawn fertilizers without the required signage or failing to separate phosphorus-containing fertilizers from those without it. Lowe’s agreed to pay $52,000 and Home Depot $78,000 in fines. Lowe’s told Reuters that most of its fertilizers did not contain phosphorous and that its signage complied with the law. The company, however, agreed to settle to avoid lengthy litigation.  SAME-STORE SALES BEAT  Lowe’s raised its full-year profit forecast to about $4.11 per share from about $4.00. The company’s same-store sales rose 7.3 percent in the first quarter, handily beating the 4.3 percent increase expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix.    The jump also outpaced the 6.5 percent rise reported by Home Depot, only the second time Lowe’s has outpaced its rival in nearly seven years.   The rise in Lowe’s same-store sales increase also handily beat the 4.3 percent increase expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix.

748,TGT,Unsold U.S. retail inventory a challenge after dismal earnings season,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A pile-up of unsold inventory across U.S. retail chains is likely to squeeze profits further as stores struggle to make up for a weak first quarter marred by weak sales and share declines. Moving the stale stock of mostly clothes, accessories and electronics is likely to lead to bigger discounts and steeper markdowns, which in turn would reduce chances for a swift profit rebound.     Tepid consumer demand for small discretionary purchases is likely to compound the problem, analysts said.      Disappointing sales by some of the biggest retailers including Target Corp (TGT.N), Macy’s Inc (M.N), JC Penney (JCP.N) and Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N) are likely to lead to even more promotions and discounts to woo customers Target’s shares fell to a 52-week low on Wednesday after its sales missed estimates. Macy’s stock fell as much as 15 percent on Wednesday after it reported a drop in sales and cut guidance.     Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell, speaking after the company released its earnings, cautioned investors about the impact of the stock build-up. “Many of our competitors are sitting on meaningful excess inventory, which we expect will extend the very intense promotional environment into the months ahead,” he said.     According to a report by analytics firm Dynamic Action, retailers sold 4 percent fewer items at full price in the first quarter than a year ago, while the percentage of promotional products ordered online jumped 63 percent. Such orders reached a record high in March, when they soared 86 percent from a year ago, the report said.  The jostling to sell excess inventory over the next three months could hit sales growth, said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst with financial services firm Edward Jones.      “Right now retailers have started cutting back on deliveries for the third and fourth quarter,” he said, referring to new inventory orders. That could leave them understocked for the end of the year, when most retailers make as much as 40 percent of their annual sales, he said.    Some retailers might be able to avoid slashing prices. The world’s largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), bucked the trend and posted surprisingly higher sales on Thursday as lower-income consumers spent more. That should mean Wal-Mart sold much of the stock earmarked for the quarter, easing the pressure to offer steep promotions and discounts, analysts said. Other bright spots included home improvement chains like Home Depot (HD.N) and Lowe’s Companies Inc (LOW.N), which have benefited from a housing recovery; and off-price apparel retailers like TJX Cos (TJX.N), which offer low-priced branded apparel and accessories. “Real disposable income growth has remained weak and that has contributed to the growth and outperformance of off-price chains and the continued slowdown for department stores,” said Craig Johnson, president at retail consultancy Customer Growth Partners. Off-price chains such as Ross Stores Inc (ROST.O) and Burlington Coat Factory had been a negligible force in the industry until a few years ago. But as consumers try to get more bang for their buck, chains that offer quality branded goods at lower prices have become increasingly popular.

749,TGT,Costco posts flat comparable U.S. sales for first time in six years,"(Reuters) - Warehouse club retailer Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) on Wednesday reported no growth in quarterly comparable sales at U.S. stores for the first time in more than six years, hurt by weak sales in April. Sales at stores in the United States open more than a year were flat, falling short of the 1.9 percent growth expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix. Comparable sales at U.S stores had last fallen in 2009. Analysts earlier this month said a pullback in spending by high-income consumers, who make up Costco’s core customer base, contributed to lower comparable sales in April, when the company posted flat growth. Unseasonably cold weather in April, transition issues arising from the company switching to Visa Inc (V.N) for its co-branded credit cards from American Express Co (AXP.N) may have also weighed on comparable sales during the third quarter ended May 8. While retailers such as Macy’s Inc (M.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N) reported weak quarterly sales, citing unseasonable weather and lower demand for apparel and electronics, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), which largely caters to lower-income customers, reported better-than-expected sales, helped by demand for basic apparel and higher drug prices.  The quarterly results from retailers suggest that lower-income customers are spending while middle and higher-income customers are holding back.  Comparable store sales were flat in the third quarter, lower than the 1 percent rise analysts were expecting. Excluding the impact of fuel and currency fluctuations, sales at comparable stores rose 3 percent, below the average analyst estimate of 4.6 percent growth. Net income attributable to Costco rose to $545 million, or $1.24 per share, in the third quarter ended May 8 from $516 million, or $1.17 per share, a year earlier.  Revenue rose 2.6 percent to $26.77 billion from $26.10 billion a year earlier.

751,TGT,Target charges suppliers more to help offload unsold inventory,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S retailer Target Corp (TGT.N) is asking many suppliers to take on up to an extra 3-5 percent of the cost of promotions and price cuts after slow sales so far this year. Retailers often use price discounts combined with promotions - such as two-for-one offers - to sell slow-moving items and make room for newer products. Suppliers also have their own offers and advertising, and usually negotiate with retailers on how the cost of these promotional budgets will be split.     A dozen suppliers confirmed to Reuters in May that Target has demanded they take on more of the costs of marketing and selling slow-moving items, from candy to electronics. The size of these costs varies on a case-by-case basis, they said, and are confidential. In total, during the year ending Jan. 30, 2016, suppliers gave Target $379 million to fund such marketing costs, according to its latest annual report. Minneapolis-based Target, the second-largest discount retailer in the United States, wants to minimize the impact of markdowns on profit in a tough year as middle income customers make fewer discretionary purchases.     In May, Target reported a drop in sales for the quarter ended April 30, and Chief Executive Brian Cornell predicted an extended period of promotions ahead for the retailer and rivals. Most suppliers who spoke to Reuters said they will have to comply or at least deliver part of Target’s demands so old stock can make way for new season products. That will strain already thin margins. “Target is not leaving a lot of room for negotiation here,” said one supplier, who asked to remain anonymous. “They want to get this unsold stock out of their stores in the next three months.”  Target spokeswoman Katie Boylan declined to comment on whether it has begun to demand suppliers pay more for marketing. She said Target regularly works with vendors to build promotional plans that drive sales. Target’s bigger competitor, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), had a better start to the year as its lower-income consumer base continued to spend. It is asking suppliers simply to give it lower prices, according to its suppliers. A Wal-Mart spokesman declined to comment. It is not clear whether other retailers will follow Target’s move. Four retailers including Macy’s Inc (M.N), Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N), Gap Inc (GPS.N) and Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N) declined to comment. Burt Flickinger, managing director of consultancy Strategic Resources Group, suggested any retailer looking to recover from a slow start this year “would be considering pushing their suppliers for more discounts, if they haven’t started doing that already.” Target stepped up the pressure at recent annual one-on-one meetings, said nine suppliers. One leading consumer goods manufacturer, who asked not to be named, said this year, Target insisted on meeting with all three product division heads instead of just one contact, to ensure its demands were met. Suppliers of consumables like processed food budget 10-12 percent of total sales for discounts and promotions. That goes up to 20-30 percent for products like apparel, accessories and furniture, Flickinger said. Target’s suppliers reduced spending last year on promotions and price cuts - known as vendor income receivables - by 11 percent from $426 million at the end of Jan. 31, 2015, according to the company’s annual report. At the same time, inventories hit $8.6 billion from $8.28 billion a year earlier, data in the annual report showed. Cornell, who started as Target CEO in July 2014, is focusing on tightening up the supply chain and selling more higher-margin products to turn sluggish sales around. In late 2015, he appointed John Mulligan as chief operating officer to fix supply chain problems and has also brought in a new merchandising officer and a supply chain officer.     Last month, Target pressured suppliers to tighten up on delivery times with the threat of fines.     Two of the suppliers who spoke with Reuters said if they are fined for missing delivery deadlines, they would consider cutting promotional fund payments by an equivalent amount.     “We have budgets to stick to,” said one supplier, who did not wish to be identified. “We cannot just keep giving them discounts on (product) volumes they are not able to sell - we have to make money when doing business with Target.” (This version of the story corrects percentage of costs Target wants many suppliers to take to up to 3 to 5 percent, instead of just 3 to 5 percent in the first sentence.)

The company in January said it was investigating reports of unusual activity with payment cards used at some of its restaurants. Wendy’s said it recently discovered a variant of a malware that was discovered and reported in May. The new malware was used to target a point-of-sales system that was earlier believed to be unaffected. The company said the new variant of the malware had been disabled in cases where it was detected. Wendy’s expects the number of franchise restaurants that will be impacted by the cybersecurity attacks is now “considerably higher” than the 300 restaurants already affected. “To date, there has been no indication in the ongoing investigation that any company-operated restaurants were impacted by this activity,” Wendy’s said on Thursday.     The new discoveries are a result of the company’s continuing investigation into unusual credit card activity at its restaurants. Large retailers such as Target Corp (TGT.N) and Home Depot Inc (HD.N) have been victims of security breaches in recent years.

757,TGT,U.S. fund managers on hunt for companies that won't be 'Amazon'ed' away,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon’s long shadow is falling on retailers previously thought immune to the threat of e-commerce, forcing U.S. fund managers to rethink their approach to consumer stocks by focusing on companies whose businesses cannot be upended by the online giant. At the core of the problem: Amazon.com Inc, once thought of as a place to buy books and household goods, is on track to become the largest apparel retailer in the United States by 2017, according to estimates from Cowen and Co, displacing department store operator Macy’s Inc.  Amazon’s push into higher-end clothing over the last three years only adds to its dominance in e-commerce overall, with a nearly 40 percent market share, one that is larger than the next 21 retailers combined - a group that includes Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Best Buy Co Inc, according to research firm Slice Intelligence.  Amazon shares hit a record high on Monday, day ahead of its Prime Day sales event. By market value, the company surpassed Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  “Retail is a landmine and you just don’t know who is going to be disrupted by Amazon. You are seeing money rotate into names where people feel comfortable with companies that won’t be Amazon’ed away,” said Scott Moore, a portfolio manager at Buffalo Funds.  More has shifted his portfolio from traditional department stores and into companies such as Home Depot Inc, whose bulky, heavy items are hard to ship profitably, he said.  Overall, actively managed large-cap funds now hold more restaurant, home improvement, and leisure stocks - all sectors in which Amazon does not yet compete -  than at any other time in the last five years, according to Morningstar data, while they have steadily cut holdings of apparel and department stores over the same period.  The number of large-cap funds that own shares of Amazon, meanwhile, has risen 15 percent over the last three years.  Susan Bao, a co-portfolio manager of the $9.9 billion JP Morgan Large-Cap Core fund, said she no longer holds traditional retailers such as Macy’s or Target Corp, and does not expect to do so again. Instead, she is focusing on companies such as cruise-ship operator Carnival Corp, which should benefit from an improving jobs market.  “This is one of companies that’s going to do better when the consumer is in better shape that’s also Amazon-proof,” she said.  Shares of Carnival are down 13.8 percent year to date, in part because of fears of the Zika virus, while Amazon’s stock is up 10.8 percent over the same time.  Fund managers who are bullish on department stores say that Amazon will likely continue to dominate the retail industry even as Macy’s and others expand their online businesses.  Lawrence Haverty, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said that he expects Sears Holding Corp to fold “within the next calendar year,” sending more shoppers to rivals such as JC Penney Company Inc at a time when the company is in the middle of a corporate turnaround that has helped it produce solid same-store sales growth.  Should Sears close its doors, “You’re going to see a very large amount of sales for others to pick up, and not all of it is going to Amazon,” Haverty said.

762,TGT,Criminal probe casts 2009 Ackman-Target boardroom brawl in new light,"BOSTON, July 15 (Reuters) - A widening criminal probe casts new light on a bitter defeat hedge fund activist Bill Ackman suffered in his 2009 bid for board seats at U.S. retailer Target Corp. Target for years has paid proxy solicitor Georgeson LLC to track the votes of its top investors. This week, five current and former Georgeson employees were charged with fraud for using bribes to get advance voting information on proxy battles. The same tactics cited in the criminal complaint were used to help Target defeat Ackman in 2009, according to a former Georgeson employee turned whistleblower. Ackman, who runs hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, failed in the high-stakes battle to install his own slate of directors at Target and change its business direction. “We knew long in advance who was winning” the Target proxy battle, Carl Clark, the whistleblower, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. He said he was fired by Georgeson in 2012 and that he flagged to authorities that bribes were being used to gain advance access on how investors were voting. The details were similar to those in the charges filed this week. Georgeson has not been charged and said in a statement on Tuesday that it was cooperating with the investigation. A spokeswoman, Rachel Hamilton-Wilkes, declined to discuss details of the case. Pershing Square executives declined to comment, spokesman Eric Kuo said. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Justice Department, Christina DiIorio-Sterling, which filed the charges, declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation. Proxy solicitors like Georgeson have become more prominent with the rise of activist investors. They help companies assess whether shareholders will vote for or against management recommendations, including who should sit on the board. Advance notice of likely proxy voting patterns would give Target extra time to identify holdouts and change investors’ minds. Information filed in U.S. District Court in Boston by prosecutors suggests that Target and many other companies benefited from an inside line Georgeson had at Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), which helps big investors cast their votes. Target has not been accused of being aware of the behavior outlined in the criminal complaint. Target, which declined to comment, continued to use Georgeson for proxy solicitation services at least through this spring, according to disclosures with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Brian Bennett, while working at ISS, tapped into the company’s computer system to see how votes were being cast on behalf of big institutional investors that include mutual funds, according to U.S. prosecutors. They said he did this in exchange for tickets to sporting events provided by Georgeson employees. One bribe included two tickets worth more than $1,400 to a Boston Celtics basketball game, according to a criminal complaint. Bennett pleaded guilty to fraud charges last year and awaits sentencing in U.S. District Court in Boston. His attorney on Friday declined to comment at a status conference held on his case. Georgeson’s Australian corporate parent, Computershare Ltd , hailed its work for Target in its 2009 annual report. “In one of the biggest proxy solicitations of the year, Georgeson represented Target Corporation in its successful proxy fight with a high profile activist investor.” Polling investors is hard work that involves a lot of cold calls to people who do not want to be harassed, according to this week’s complaint. “(Eighty percent) of clients do not divulge,” one of the former Georgeson employees, Michael Sedlak, told Bennett, according to the filing. “They just say they voted.” An attorney for Sedlak did not return messages seeking comment. In 2013, Bennett’s former company, ISS, paid $300,000 to settle SEC charges it failed to safeguard client voting data. The SEC said its investigation found that information on more than 100 shareholder advisory clients had been shared. All of Target’s four board nominees were re-elected with more than 70 percent of votes cast, while none of Ackman’s nominees got more than 22 percent of votes cast, Target has said. The case is unsettling, said one institutional investor who had backed one of Ackman’s nominees in the 2009 vote, because companies already have a lot of influence over shareholder elections. In theory, inside information such as what the Georgeson team was getting could make a difference in close contests. “It’s a fairness issue,” said the money manager, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the 2009 vote.

764,TGT,Target says low demand for Apple products hurts electronics sales,"(Reuters) - Target Corp reported a drop in demand for Apple Inc’s products that hurt the retail chain’s electronics sales in the second quarter, but said it is working with the iPhone maker to capitalize on new product launches during the second half. Earlier on Wednesday, Target cut its fiscal-year profit outlook after quarterly sales fell more than expected due to lower demand for electronics and a weak start to a revamp of its grocery business. The company’s shares closed down 6.4 percent at $70.63 after falling as much as 7.4 percent. Chief Executive Brian Cornell said customer visits declined across product categories during the quarter but electronics sales fell by a double-digit percentage rate and accounted for about two-thirds of the overall decline in sales at stores open at least a year.  About a third of the decrease in electronics sales stemmed from reduced demand for Apple products, which were down more than 20 percent. In April, Apple reported its first-ever decline in iPhone sales and its first revenue drop in 13 years due to a saturated market for smartphones. Cornell said one of the first tasks for newly appointed Chief Merchandising Officer Mark Tritton is to spend time with Apple to make sure “we’re putting the right plans together for the back half of the year, that we’re ready to capitalize on their new innovation that they will be bringing to the market.” Apple’s long-awaited iPhone 7 is expected to be launched next month and retailers hope it will create enthusiasm among consumers and boost phone sales. For the past several quarters Best Buy Inc, the largest electronics retailer in the United States, has complained about the lack of innovative new products to excite consumers. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Target’s sales declined from the previous quarter as well as from a year earlier, indicating a “significant slowdown in trade,” said Neil Saunders, chief executive officer of research firm Conlumino. Sales at stores open at least one year fell 1.1 percent in the second quarter ended on July 30, which Saunders said was the first decline in two years.  Target said it expected same-store sales to be flat to down 2 percent in the second half of the year.  The company’s sales have suffered as shoppers increasingly use online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc and focus their spending on big-ticket items like cars and home renovations rather than small discretionary purchases. The company lowered its full-year profit forecast to between $4.80 and $5.20 per share from a prior range of $5.20 to $5.40. Target, which has been reorganizing its grocery business by adding more organic and fresh food, said those early efforts were disappointing. The business had a “small” decline in comparable sales and was pressured by price deflation for meat, milk and other food items. The company gained market share in the apparel and home improvement categories, Cornell said. Net income attributable to the company fell nearly 10 percent to $680 million in the second quarter. Earnings before special items exceeded analysts’ estimates.      Net sales fell 7.2 percent to $16.17 billion, lagging Wall Street expectations of $16.18 billion.  Digital sales increased 16 percent, a deceleration from previous quarters, and accounted for 3.3 percent of the company’s total.

769,TGT,UPDATE 3-Estee Lauder's forecast takes hit on global uncertainties,"(Reuters) - Cosmetics maker Estee Lauder Cos Inc (EL.N) forecast a lower-than-expected profit for the full year, hurt by fewer customer visits to department stores and uncertainties in some markets. The company’s shares were down 2.6 percent at $92.59 in afternoon trade on Friday. Estee Lauder said uncertainties surrounding Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, attacks in France and sluggish spending in the Middle East will weigh on its full-year profit.  The New York City-based company said it expects fiscal 2017 adjusted profit to be between $3.38 and $3.44 per share, missing the average analyst estimate of $3.53 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We believe risk of other economic and political disruptions will remain high as we start our new fiscal year,” CFO Tracey Travis said on an earnings call.  Rival L’Oreal SA (OREP.PA) earlier reported second-quarter sales growth marginally below forecast as it said Western Europe was being held back due to a “very difficult market in France”. Estee Lauder said it expects “especially strong external headwinds” in the current quarter. Sales are expected to be in the range of $2.86 billion-$2.89 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $2.94 billion. The company also reported a smaller-than-expected rise in quarterly sales, hurt by lower tourist spending due to the strong dollar and a dip in customer visits at stores such as Macy’s Inc (M.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N), where it sells high-end beauty products. Macy’s and Target also cited lower traffic for the drop in sales in their latest quarter.      Sales in the Americas, its biggest market, rose 1.4 pct to $1.1 billion on a reported basis, its slowest growth in four quarters. Total sales rose to $2.65 billion from $2.52 billion.  Lower retail traffic in the United States mainly affected the company’s “heritage” brands Estee Lauder and Clinique, and a few M.A.C freestanding stores, the company said. Weak sales in some Asia-Pacific countries, mainly Hong Kong, also dented total sales. Net income attributable to the company fell to $93.5 million, or 25 cents per share, in the quarter. Excluding items, the company earned 43 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 40 cents per share and revenue of $2.66 billion. The company also said it expects to incur charges of about $80 million-$100 million in fiscal 2017, related to restructuring initiatives, including exiting businesses in certain markets and reducing its workforce globally.  Up to Thursday’s close, the stock had risen 13.5 percent in the past year.

The results bucked a string of weak performances in the electronics category by competitors like Target Corp (TGT.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and reflected Best Buy’s resilience against larger online rival Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Best Buy reported a nearly 24 percent increase in online sales, whose share of domestic revenue has risen to 10.6 percent from 8.6 percent a year earlier. It said it benefited from faster shipping and improvements in the checkout process and search functionality. “Given the heavily promotional July environment due to Amazon’s Prime Day and Walmart’s steady diet of competing offers, Best Buy’s online results stand out,” Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea said. He estimated the company’s online business at about $5 billion. Best Buy Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly said that along with e-commerce investments, the retailer is focusing on improving employee retention and training “with a heightened focus on product knowledge and selling skills.”  During the second quarter ended on July 30, demand at Best Buy increased for items like home theaters and large appliances, categories where Target and Wal-Mart typically do not have a significant market share, according to analysts. Sales declined for mobile phones and gaming, where those rivals have a sizeable presence. Mobile phone sales have fallen industrywide due to a dearth of new products. Best Buy Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly said he expected demand to increase this quarter and next as scheduled product introductions draw consumers. Apple Inc’s APPL.O long-awaited iPhone 7 is set for availability next month. Last week, Target blamed its poor performance in part on lower sales of electronics due to a drop in demand for Apple products. Excluding special items, Best Buy’s second-quarter earnings of 57 cents per share beat the analysts’ average forecast of 43 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose slightly to $8.53 billion from a year earlier, snapping a three-quarter streak of declines and exceeding analysts’ estimates of $8.40 billion.  Sales at established stores increased 0.8 percent. Analysts had expected a 0.60 percent decline, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Best Buy said it expected low-single-digit percentage growth in fiscal-year operating income, compared with a previous forecast of “approximately flat” results. The company gave a third-quarter profit and revenue outlook roughly in line with analysts’ estimates.

775,TGT,Uber hires senior Target executive to lead global operations,"(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] has plucked a top executive from U.S. retailer Target to help lead the growing ride-services company and reshape its image. Uber said on Tuesday it hired Jeff Jones, chief marketing officer for Target Corp, to oversee the bulk of its global operations. Jones will be president of ride-sharing at Uber, running local Uber services in every city, as well as marketing efforts and customer support. The hire underscores efforts by Uber, which has become the dominant on-demand ride service, to bolster its reputation and brand. Since 2009, the company has aggressively expanded to more than 450 cities, at times steamrolling regulators and launching campaigns against local lawmakers. Jones joined Target in 2012 to rejuvenate its brand and is credited with modernizing the retailer’s marketing efforts. He led campaigns including #MoreMusic, under which Target partnered with singer Gwen Stefani for a live video that aired during the Grammy Awards and released exclusive tracks from artists such as Adele, part of an effort to burnish Target’s cool image. Prior to that, Jones led marketing for Gap Inc and worked for Coca-Cola and advertising firm McKinney. “Jones has a strong track record of driving the narrative around Target’s brand, and will now try to do the same for Uber,” said Mike Mannor, associate professor at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business. “You can surely expect to see stakeholders responding positively to Uber CEO Travis Kalanick taking steps to upgrade his middling in-house talent with proven professional chops.” Kalanick said in a blog post that he and Jones met in February and ""within minutes we were debating how Uber could improve its reputation."" (ubr.to/2cclIj5) Kalanick said he wants to align Uber’s marketing functions more closely with individual city operations and put more focus on customer service. Uber’s global operations span dozens of countries and about 1.5 million drivers. Jones’ hiring marks a change for Ryan Graves, who has been at Uber since 2010 and ran the company’s operations and global expansion. Graves will give up some of those responsibilities but continue to work on Uber’s delivery businesses, including UberEats and UberRush, as well as other projects, Kalanick said. Jones’ exit is the latest in a string of executive departures from Target, which has made a series of management changes since last year.  Among other moves, the big-box retailer appointed Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan to the newly created role of chief operating officer. It has also added new hires as it focuses on higher-margin categories such as baby and wellness products and revamps online sales.

778,TGT,Target urges employees to help turn around performance ahead of holidays,"MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) Chief Executive Brian Cornell on Thursday urged the company’s employees to focus on delivering a better in-store and online experience for shoppers in an attempt to turn around its performance before the crucial holiday season. Target has had a lackluster first half and warned of flat or a slight decrease in same-store sales for the second half of 2016, as shoppers turn to the internet and spend on big-ticket items like cars and home renovations, rather than small, discretionary purchases that make up the bulk of Target’s offerings. “Competition has been fierce and we have had a few bumps on the road this year,” Cornell told thousands of store employees gathered at an annual meeting near its headquarters in Minneapolis. “We have 137 days to turn this into a winning year.” He asked employees to deliver a strong marketing program, make sure stores were sufficiently stocked and asked them to make better decisions when it came to operating stores.  Last month, Target’s second quarter traffic and sales at stores open at least a year fell more than expected, and the retailer said it expects comparable store sales to either stay flat or fall by as much as 2 percent in the second half of 2016. “(Comparable sales) are flat year-to-date. I’m disappointed with that... we own that,” Cornell told reporters at a session held before the meeting. Target’s performance has suffered since the first quarter of this fiscal year. The first half performance led Cowen & Co analysts to recently downgrade the stock. In a note, the brokerage said the “weakness that began in the first quarter coupled with the significant traffic decline seen in the second quarter demonstrate to us that Target is losing share to the likes of Amazon (AMZN.O) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N).” Cornell expects changes to help drive a sales rebound and also boost groceries sales, which count for a fifth of its $74 billion annual revenue.  Target has been reorganizing its grocery business, adding more fresh produce as well as organic and gluten-free items, while also testing new displays. It plans to focus more advertising on such items in its weekly circulars and promotions, Cornell said.  Target will also focus on rolling out more smaller-format stores and expects meaningful sales from that starting next year. The retailer runs 23 smaller-format stores, which it categorizes as less than 50,000 square feet, and plans to open nine more this year and at least 16 in 2017.

780,TGT,"Kohl's to keep seasonal hiring little changed at about 69,000","(Reuters) - Department store operator Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N) said on Monday it would hire more than 69,000 extra workers in the United States this holiday shopping season, about the same as last year, echoing larger retailer Target Corp’s (TGT.N) decision to keep seasonal hiring around last year’s level. Target said last week it would hire 70,000 in-store workers for the holiday season, unchanged for the fourth straight year. It will, however, hire 7,500 workers for its distribution and fulfillment centers - about 1,000 more than last year. (bit.ly/2cN68GS) Target and department store chains such as Kohl’s and Macy’s Inc (M.N) have largely reported disappointing sales over the past few quarters, hurt by low demand for apparel and unseasonable weather. The retailers are also struggling to compete with online rival Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), which offers more discounts and has made shopping more convenient. Retailers make nearly a third of their annual sales and generate nearly 40 percent of their profits during the holiday selling season, which starts a day after Thanksgiving and continues into early January. The fact that Kohl’s is not hiring more than last year makes sense, said Robert W. Baird & Co analyst Mark Altschwager. “Amid a generally sluggish apparel sales environment, retailers are keeping close watch on inventory and expenses in order to protect their bottom lines,” he said in an email. “Nobody wants a repeat of deep margin cuts experienced last year.” Kohl’s had 32,000 full-time employees and 108,000 part-time workers as of Jan. 30. Macy’s is yet to announce its seasonal hiring plans. Kohl’s, which has more than 1,100 stores in 49 states, said seasonal workers would be added in its distribution, e-commerce fulfillment centers and credit operations as well as in stores.  The company increased its seasonal hiring by about 3 percent last year.  Kohl’s said seasonal hiring started last month and that most jobs would be filled by mid-November. Kohl’s shares were up 1.9 percent at $43.77 at midday, while Target’s were little changed at $69.47.

785,TGT,UPDATE 4-Yahoo says hackers stole data from 500 mln accounts in 2014,"(Reuters) - Yahoo Inc YHOO.O said on Thursday that at least 500 million of its accounts were hacked in 2014 by what it believed was a state-sponsored actor, a theft that appeared to be the world’s biggest known cyber breach by far. Cyber thieves may have stolen names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and encrypted passwords, the company said. But unprotected passwords, payment card data and bank account information did not appear to have been compromised, signaling that some of the most valuable user data was not taken. The attack on Yahoo was unprecedented in size, more than triple other large attacks on sites such as eBay Inc (EBAY.O), and it comes to light at a difficult time for Yahoo. Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer is under pressure to shore up the flagging fortunes of the site founded in 1994, and the company in July agreed to a $4.83 billion cash sale of its internet business to Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N).  “This is the biggest data breach ever,” said well-known cryptologist Bruce Schneier, adding that the impact on Yahoo and its users remained unclear because many questions remain, including the identity of the state-sponsored hackers behind it. On its website on Thursday, Yahoo encouraged users to change their passwords but did not require it. Although the attack happened in 2014, Yahoo only discovered  the incursion after August reports of a separate breach. While that report turned out to be false, Yahoo’s investigation turned up the 2014 theft, according to a person familiar with the matter. Analyst Robert Peck of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey said the breach probably was not enough to prompt Verizon to abandon its deal with Yahoo, but it could call for a price decrease of $100 million to $200 million, depending on how many users leave Yahoo.  Steven Caponi, an attorney at K&L; Gates with a practice including merger litigation, said that Yahoo’s breach could fall under the “material adverse change” clause common in mergers allowing a buyer to walk away if its target’s value deteriorates.  “That would give Verizon the opportunity to renegotiate the terms or potentially walk away from the transaction if it is a material change. Whether it is a material change will depend in large part on what kind of information was compromised,” Caponi said.  Still, it is rare for mergers to fall apart over material changes. Verizon said in a statement it was made aware of the breach within the last two days and had limited information about the matter. “We will evaluate as the investigation continues through the lens of overall Verizon interests,” the company said. Shares of Yahoo stock closed a penny higher at $44.15, while shares of Verizon, were up about 1 percent. The Yahoo breach follows a rising number of other large-scale data attacks and could make it a watershed event that prompts government and businesses to put more effort into bolstering defenses, said Dan Kaminsky, a well-known internet security expert. Retailers and health insurers have been especially hard hit after high-profile breaches at Home Depot Inc (HD.N), Target Corp (TGT.N), Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Premera Blue Cross.  “Five hundred of the Fortune 500 have been hacked,” he said. “If anything has changed, it’s that these attacks are getting publicly disclosed.” Three U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to be identified by name, said they believed the attack was state-sponsored because of its resemblance to previous hacks traced to Russian intelligence agencies or hackers acting at their direction. Yahoo said it was working with law enforcement on the matter, and the FBI said it was investigating. “The investigation has found no evidence that the state-sponsored actor is currently in Yahoo’s network,” the company said. While the breach comprised mostly low-value information, it did include security questions and answers created by users themselves. That data could make users vulnerable if they use the same answers on other sites.  A former Yahoo employee said the Q&A; were deliberately left unencrypted, which allowed Yahoo to catch fake accounts more easily because fake accounts tended to reuse questions and answers. News of the massive breach at one of the nation’s largest email providers may fan concern that U.S. companies and government agencies are not doing enough to improve cyber security.      Democratic Senator Mark Warner said in a statement he was “most troubled by news that this breach occurred in 2014, and yet the public is only learning details of it today.”  Technology website Recode first reported Tuesday that Yahoo planned to disclose details about a data breach affecting hundreds of millions of users.

788,TGT,UPDATE 1-Chevron supports director Stumpf despite Wells Fargo morass,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) on Monday said it stands behind John Stumpf, a member of its board and the chief executive of bank Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), despite growing concerns about his leadership during a customer service scandal. Pressure has mounted on Stumpf in recent days to resign as CEO of Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. bank by deposits, after revelations the bank for years opened checking, savings and credit card accounts without customer approval to satisfy managers’ demands for new business.     Lawmakers of both major U.S. political parties in Congress have excoriated Stumpf, accusing him of creating a culture in which such a practice could thrive. Earlier this month Stumpf resigned from an advisory role at the U.S. Federal Reserve.  Chevron executives had cited his experience and reputation as a major benefit to its shareholders when recommending him to the board. The company’s board also noted his position at the Fed when it nominated him to the board. “John (Stumpf) is a valued member of our board,” Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson said in an emailed statement to Reuters. “Given the investigations that are underway, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.”     Stumpf joined the 10-person Chevron board in 2010, the same year he became chairman of the San Francisco-based bank and three years after he became its CEO. Both companies are headquartered in California’s Bay Area and are roughly 35 miles (55 km) apart.   Stumpf also is a director at retailer Target Corp (TGT.N), which declined to comment on whether he will remain on its board.  At Chevron, the second-largest U.S.-based oil and natural gas producer, Stumpf serves on board committees that oversee corporate governance and executive compensation. Chevron does not hold any meaningful stake in Wells Fargo.

Target (TGT.N) decided last week to winnow down its assortment of clown masks and costumes available for sale in U.S. stores and online “given the current environment,” company spokesman Joshua Thomas said on Monday. Although Target received some isolated consumer comments about scary clown accessories, the decision to pull some masks from inventories stemmed from “a conversation internally about how we can respond to the situation at hand,” Thomas told Reuters. The clown-mask culling, limited to one in-store product item and about 10 different selections online, affected a “very tiny” portion of Target’s overall Halloween merchandise, Thomas added. Target declined to specify exactly which products were pulled but said those kept in stock reflected a more traditional, less threatening image of happy, cheerful clowns. Similarly, McDonald’s (MCD.N) and its franchise owners have cut back in the number of public appearances being made by performers dressed up as the chain’s trademark hamburger-happy clown Ronald McDonald during the past two weeks, according to the company. The fast-food chain, in a statement, cited “the current climate around clown sightings in communities” for its decision. Reports of menacing individuals dressed as clowns or wearing clown masks began surfacing in late August around Greenville, South Carolina, and have since spread to several other states, perplexing police and unnerving parents across the country. Clowns have been reported spotted lurking near wooded areas or on dark roads, and even driving in cars, some brandishing knives or waving wads of money at children. The phenomenon has created a stir on social media, with the hashtag #IfISeeAClown and @ClownSightings generating a large following on Twitter.

798,TGT,"Target to offer more deals, extend free shipping until January","NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Target Corp will offer more deal-driven promotions and extend its free shipping window to January this holiday season as it looks to turn around performance in what has so far been a lackluster year for the retailer. Target also expects consumer spending to remain robust in November and December despite uncertainty around the U.S. Presidential elections. The holiday shopping season is an important time for retailers during which they earn an outsized portion of their annual profits and sales. “We are looking at very low unemployment, fuel prices remain  low, the commodity pressure on food is down,” Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell told reporters in a meeting on Tuesday. “The overall approach for the consumer is going to be positive this season.” Improving performance during the holiday months is crucial for Target. After a slow first half of the year, the retailer has warned of flat or slightly lower same-store sales for the second half of 2016, as shoppers turn to the internet and spend on big-ticket items like cars and home renovations, rather than small, discretionary purchases that make up the bulk of Target’s offerings. The Minneapolis-based retailer said it will offer more deals this year under its program ‘Ten Days of Deals’ which will include category-wide promotions, like ‘spend $50 on apparel and save $10.’ Target will also extend its free shipping offer until Jan. 1 this year from Dec. 25 last year and drop shipping fees for all online orders for a third year in a row. The retailer currently requires a minimum online order of $25 to qualify for free shipping. Free-shipping boosted Target’s digital sales growth to over 30 percent during the fourth quarter last year and is a key strategy that allows it to better compete with rivals like Amazon.com Inc. Target expects its ship-from-store program which it has  expanded to 1,000 stores from over 400 last year, to speed up delivery times. The retailer also said it would increase its holiday advertising budget for television with a special focus on Spanish-language programs, as it looks to bring in more Hispanic shoppers, a traditionally strong consumer demographic for Target. It expects growth to be strong in the home decor, toy and apparel categories. Target plans to offer a large selection of clothing and accessories for less than $40, nearly 1,800 exclusive Star Wars toys, and electronics like connected home devices during the holidays.

799,TGT,"Target's leadership shakeup continues, grocery chief steps down","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) said on Wednesday its grocery chief is stepping down, as the retailer struggles to overhaul a key business and attract more shoppers to visit its grocery aisles. Anne Dament will leave the company on Nov. 18, less than eighteen months after she was appointed and tasked with turning around the grocery business, which accounts for a fifth or about $18.5 billion of Target’s overall sales.  This is the third high-profile exit at Target in less than four months. In September, the Minneapolis-based retailer’s chief digital officer Jason Goldberger left the company, a month after Target’s chief marketing officer Jeff Jones left to join Uber Technologies [UBER.UL].  Revamping the grocery business and making the sixth-largest U.S. retailer a more compelling destination for groceries has been a key priority for Chief Executive Brian Cornell who took over in 2014. Since then Target has added more healthy, organic and gluten-free items in an effort to attract millennial shoppers, improved its store design and made leadership changes in the business. But despite these efforts, grocery sales during the second quarter fell with Target reporting its first quarterly drop in comparable sales in two years. The company lowered its forecast for the rest of the year, saying it expects sales to be flat to down 2 percent in the two remaining quarters. Target’s sales have suffered as shoppers increasingly use online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and focus their spending on big-ticket items like cars and home renovations rather than small discretionary purchases.

801,TGT,Target expresses confidence about holiday sales; shares rise,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) on Wednesday reported a much higher-than-expected quarterly profit after benefiting from a strong back-to-school shopping season and increased online sales, and it gave an optimistic outlook for the all-important holiday period. The Minneapolis-based retailer’s shares, which had fallen nearly 2 percent so far this year, rose 6.4 percent to end at $76.03.  Results have improved from recent quarters, when competition from online rivals like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and slower sales of smaller items like electronics and food hurt Target’s earnings. The company had to shake up its top leadership, with three high-profile exits in the past four months.  Target’s sales for the third quarter ended on Oct. 29 showed the company was still losing market share, said Neil Saunders, chief executive officer of research firm Conlumino. “Although Target’s performance has improved, it would be wrong to say that it is now a company firing on all cylinders,” he said.  The company said demand for Apple Inc (AAPL.O) merchandise, which had been disappointing in the second quarter, improved because of new products like the iPhone 7. Ahead of the holidays, advance orders for the brand were three times higher than a year earlier,  Target said it expected consumer spending to remain strong through the holidays. Last week, department store rivals Macy’s Inc (M.N) and Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N) forecast an acceleration this quarter. Target CEO Brian Cornell said store visits increased and sales trends improved by a percentage point during the third quarter. Digital sales jumped 26 percent, an acceleration from previous quarters. Comparable sales in high-margin “signature” categories such as baby, health and wellness outpaced those overall by three percentage points. “As we move into the biggest quarter of the year, we are pleased with our inventory position,” Cornell said. Target, which has been investing heavily to improve its supply chain for over a year, said it would be well-stocked during the holiday season even though it will keep its overall inventory base lower than last year.  The retailer also stress-tested its website with a promotion during the third quarter and said it was prepared to handle the surge in online orders. Last year, the website crashed briefly during Cyber Monday, the biggest U.S. online shopping day, which falls right after the Thanksgiving weekend.  Target forecast fiscal-year earnings of $5.10 to $5.30 per share, excluding special items, up from a prior outlook of $4.80 to $5.20. It also raised the forecast for its sales performance at stores open at least a year by one percentage point to a range of down 1 percent to up 1 percent for this quarter. Net income attributable to Target rose nearly 11 percent to $608 million in the third quarter from a year earlier. Earnings of $1.04 per share before special items beat the analysts’ average estimate of 83 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total sales fell 6.7 percent to $16.4 billion.

Target’s decision to introduce its mobile payment service follows rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) which launched Wal-Mart Pay in December 2015.

820,TGT,"INSIGHT-How Toyota, Target, Best Buy are fighting back against Republican border tax push","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Days before a group of Republican lawmakers were due to discuss their party’s controversial proposal to tax all imports, Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) sent an urgent message to its U.S. dealers - tell the politicians the tax would seriously hurt car buyers. Some of Toyota’s 1,500 dealers heeded the call and contacted  members of the House of Representatives’ tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, urging them to rethink their proposal, according to people familiar with the effort.  Imposing a 20 percent tax on imports would force consumers to pay potentially thousands of dollars more for vehicles, they warned.  The Japanese automaker’s mobilization of its army of dealers underscores the growing alarm among some of the world’s largest companies that sell imported goods in the United States. They fear a big tax on imports would hurt their sales and profits and put them at a disadvantage to rivals more reliant on U.S.-made products. “Cost is going to go up, as a result demand is going to go down. As a result, we’re not going to able to employ as many as people as we do today. That’s my biggest fear,” Toyota’s North America CEO Jim Lentz said in an interview. Toyota dealers employ more than 97,000 people in the United States.  While companies and industry groups frequently lobby Congress, the threat of an import tax has mobilized an unusually broad swath of firms at home and abroad. That lobbying effort is taking place largely out of the public eye partly to avoid potential conflict with President Donald Trump, who has attacked companies for manufacturing abroad for U.S. consumers. Earlier this month Trump targeted Toyota, threatening to impose a hefty fee on the world’s largest automaker if it builds its Corolla cars for the U.S. market at a plant in Mexico. The White House said last week that a border tax is one option under review to pay for a wall with Mexico, although what exactly Trump is planning to do is still not clear. He has pledged to impose a “big border tax” on Mexican imports.     The plan proposed by House Republicans would cut corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent, exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose the 20 percent tax on imports.     Companies that rely heavily on imports say a border tax will outweigh the benefit of a lower headline corporate tax.     As car dealers are reaching out to members of Congress in their districts, Toyota and other automakers are lobbying lawmakers in states where they have large manufacturing plants and employ thousands of workers. The No. 3 vehicle seller in the United States behind General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N), Toyota imports about 1.2 million vehicles to the U.S. market annually, half of its 2.4 million U.S. sales. It employs 40,000 people directly. Toyota and the automakers are not alone in this lobbying effort.     Target Corp’s (TGT.N) chief executive, Brian Cornell, traveled to Washington to meet members of the House Ways and Means Committee. He told them an import tax could impact consumers’ ability to buy essential goods, such as baby supplies that are made overseas and imported to the United States, according to a person familiar with the talks. Target spokeswoman Dustee Jenkins confirmed the visit. The largest U.S. electronics retailer, Best Buy (BBY.N), headquartered down the road from Minneapolis-based Target, has circulated a flyer to lawmakers. It cites an analyst forecast that a 20 percent tax would wipe out the company’s projected annual net income of $1 billion and turn it into a $2 billion loss. The flyer, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, argues that foreign Internet sellers like China’s Alibaba.com would be able to avoid the tax by making sales online and shipping to U.S. consumers directly, “undercutting U.S. businesses.”  Company officials have been handing out the flyer to lawmakers and their staff on Capitol Hill, Best Buy spokesman Jeff Shelman confirmed. Constellation Brands (STZ.N), which brews Corona and Modelo in Mexico, has been pushing lawmakers to exempt products like Mexican beer in any border tax “because it’s inherently a Mexican product,” CEO Rob Sands said on an earnings call.     But if that effort fails, Constellation is prepared to buy more raw materials from the United States instead of Mexico, Sands said. Koch Industries [KCHIN.UL], the second-largest private U.S. company according to Forbes, said in a statement a border tax would have a “devastating” impact on consumers. The company, owned by Republican donors Charles and David Koch, includes oil refining and manufacturing interests.     Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political group founded by the billionaire brothers, told Reuters the powerful group has started to educate its network of activists about the tax, so they can lobby against it. AFP says it has two million activists. Not everyone in corporate America is worried about a new border tax.     Several aerospace companies including Boeing Co (BA.N), United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and Raytheon Co (RTN.N) said in earnings calls last week that a border tax could be positive for net exporters like them.     “We see the aerospace sector as fundamentally having an advantage in that regard,” Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said.  The American International Automobile Dealers Association (AIADA), however, called the proposal “heart stopping,” in a letter last week to 9,500 dealers selling vehicles like Toyota, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), and BMW (BMWG.DE). Opponents of the border tax may have already found some allies. Republican Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, where BMW has a large plant, said the importance of foreign automakers such as BMW and Toyota to the economy needs to be considered when making laws. “I cannot overstate how significant that industry is to my state,” Gowdy said in an interview, adding that he and his wife both drive Toyotas.

821,TGT,"UPDATE 2-Trump meets with retail CEOs to talk taxes, imports","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday called tax code revisions a critical way to boost the nation’s economy as he kicked off a White House meeting with chief executive officers of Target Corp (TGT.N), Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) and six other major retailers. The retailers spoke with Trump about an overhaul of the corporate tax law and infrastructure improvements. While companies like Best Buy and Target support changes to the tax code, they urged Trump to oppose a proposal for a new border tax on imported goods.  The border tax is among sweeping changes proposed by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. Convincing Trump to oppose the measure would probably bring an end to it.  Trump had said on Thursday that he would announce his own “phenomenal” tax plan in the coming weeks. U.S. stocks hit record intraday highs, and the U.S. dollar and bond yields rose.  At Wednesday’s meeting, Trump said work on a tax plan was going “really well” but gave no details except to say it would simplify the tax code. The meeting included Target’s Brian Cornell, Best Buy’s Hubert Joly, Gap Inc’s (GPS.N) Art Peck, Autozone Inc’s (AZO.N) William Rhodes, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc’s (WBA.O) Stefano Pessina, J.C. Penney Co Inc’s (JCP.N) Marvin Ellison, Jo-Ann Stores’ Jill Soltau and Tractor Supply Co’s (TSCO.O) Gregory Sandfort. “We stressed the importance of taking a thoughtful approach to tax reform for both individuals and corporations,” Rhodes said after the meeting.  The group also met with the heads of the two tax-writing congressional committees, Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.  Brady and House Speaker Paul Ryan are leading the push to cut the corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent, impose a 20 percent tax on imports and exclude export revenue from taxable income.  Companies that rely heavily on imports, such as retailers, automakers and refiners, say House Republicans’ border tax would outweigh the benefit of a lower headline corporate tax. Critics also say the tax would lead to higher consumer prices for imported products.  Trump has voiced some concern about the House tax proposal, calling it “too complicated.” But the White House also has said a border tax on goods from Mexico is one option under review to pay for a wall along the nation’s southern border. “Tax reform is one of the best opportunities to influence our economy,” Trump said in brief opening remarks that included no mention of the border tax idea. The prospect of a big import tax is also pitting large U.S. companies against one another. A group of major exporters, including Boeing Co (BA.N), General Electric Co (GE.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), has formed a coalition to support the import tax.

823,TGT,Florida man charged with plotting to bomb Target stores,"(Reuters) - A Florida man has been charged with plotting to plant bombs in at least 10 Target Corp stores and then profit when the blasts caused the company’s stock price to fall, federal prosecutors have said. Charles Barnett, 48, of Ocala, had asked a law enforcement informant to put the homemade bombs on the shelves of Target stores from Florida to New York state, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida said in a statement on Thursday. “Barnett theorized that the company’s stock value would plunge after the explosions, allowing him to cheaply acquire shares of Target stock before an eventual rebound in prices,” the statement said. A criminal complaint said the bombs were disguised in packages for pasta, stuffing mix and breakfast bars and delivered to the informant on Feb. 9. Barnett also gave the informant gloves, a mask and a license plate cover to conceal his identity from police. The informant, a convicted burglar on probation, turned the bombs in to authorities on Monday, the complaint said. A search of Barnett’s house by federal agents turned up bomb parts. The complaint said that Barnett was a registered sex offender and was on probation for felonies that included kidnapping, sexual battery and grand theft. He wears a Global Positioning System monitor as part of his probation. Barnett is charged with possession of a firearm, or destructive device, affecting commerce by a felon.

825,TGT,"Target shares dive on earnings outlook, price cut plans","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) said on Tuesday it will rely more on low prices to compete with rivals like Wal-Mart and Amazon, admitted many of its stores needed freshening up, and told Wall Street its sales and profit estimates for 2017 are too high.  Shares of the retailer plunged to 2-1/2-year lows in heavy trading. Many of its rivals fell, too, including deep discount chains that will now face tougher competition on prices. For investors, the news was a shocking reminder that U.S. retailing remains a cutthroat business.    Target vowed aggressive promotions at a meeting with analysts and investors, saying new brands and investments in technology and small stores will allow it to eventually win back market share.  Although its e-commerce operation is growing, Target reported its third straight quarter of lower sales from existing stores, citing “unexpected softness” at its stores. Target also forecast first-quarter profit short of Wall Street estimates. Shares sank 12.1 percent to $58.79, their biggest one-day percentage drop since 2008. The stock has lost a quarter of its value since the holiday shopping season started in November, back to levels last seen in August 2014. The retail industry faces pressure from lackluster U.S. economic growth, intense competition from Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and other online rivals and concerns about President Donald Trump’s planned border tax. With Tuesday’s announcement, Target’s brand identity as a source for “cheap chic” fashion and other low-cost stylish goods is giving way to the push for lower prices, analysts said.  That prompted declines across the retail sector. Dow component Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) closed down 1.1 percent, Kroger Co (KR.N) fell 1.3 percent and Macy’s Inc (M.N) lost 1 percent. Dollar General Corp (DG.N) fell 4.9 percent and Dollar Tree (DLTR.O) was down 3.6 percent.  Shares of Amazon, whose market cap exceeds all those companies combined, closed down slightly.  The drop in Target shares also reflects missteps by the company, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.  “Target didn’t do its job of trying to engage its customers and the theory is they may have lost the ability to do it,” she said. “That’s what the (stock) market is telling you.”  The retailer plans “aggressive promotional activities” that would erode its operating profit by $1 billion this year, Chief Executive Brian Cornell said at the meeting on Tuesday. Revamping older stores is also part of Cornell’s plan. Target has “a large percentage of the portfolio where the buildings just don’t match the brand. They are old. They’re tired. And they have not been updated in years,” he said on a conference call.  Target said it planned to invest $2 billion in 2017 on analytics, supply chain and opening 100 more small-format stores in urban neighborhoods and college markets. It also plans to launch more than 12 exclusive brands. Target forecast full-year earnings of $3.80-$4.20 per share from continuing operations, while analysts on average were expecting profit above $5.00, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. [nBw2wpt55a] One of the first areas where prices will come down at Target is food, the company said. Food and pet supplies account for about a fifth of Target sales, according to its annual report. On Monday, Reuters reported Wal-Mart launched a new front in U.S. price wars with a test in 1,200 stores to lower grocery prices. [nL2N1GC03L]      With Wal-Mart and Amazon already facing off on price, including in the grocery aisle, Target is in an uncomfortable middle ground. And where Wal-Mart has established itself as the nation’s largest grocer, Target’s foray into food has been less successful. “Target is neither a full-line grocer nor a player with lots of niche specialty products; it is neither a high-end player, nor a price-focused discounter,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.  Target’s grocery offerings are “confusing,” he said.  Two years ago, bigger rival Wal-Mart aggressively cut prices across the board and boosted its online presence. Target could not act then due to costs related to a massive data breach and its decision to pull out of Canada. “Target’s got bigger issues (than Wal-Mart had),” said analyst Brian Yarbrough of Edward Jones.  “They’ve struggled since Brian Cornell’s come on to figure out what to do with their grocery department ... I think Target’s turnaround could take a little bit longer than Wal-Mart.”  Separately, CEO Cornell said he has been talking with the Trump administration to argue against a border tax that would raise the price of imports, including food like coffee and bananas. “We are trying to make sure consumers are not waking up paying prices that are 15 or 20 or 25 percent higher,” Cornell said. “And it wouldn’t bring jobs back to the United States because we don’t have factories that are ready to start manufacturing these products.” Target’s same-store sales fell 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday season. That was steeper than the 1.3 percent drop analysts estimated, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Target expects same-store sales to decline by low-single digits in fiscal 2017. Analysts, on average, were expecting same-store sales to increase 0.4 percent in 2017.      A 34 percent jump in digital sales was not enough to keep overall net sales in the black.

Minneapolis-based Target, which has been trying to revamp its food business for about two years, has lagged Wal-Mart which has now established itself as the nation’s largest grocer. Burt, who joins Target after 30 years at grocer Kroger, will report to Chief Merchandising Officer Mark Tritton.

838,TGT,Target slashes CEO pay package after bleak year,"(Reuters) - Target Corp’s (TGT.N) Chief Executive Brian Cornell took a sharp cut in compensation after the company failed to meet financial goals in a year marred by declines in sales and share price.  Cornell’s cash-and-stock compensation fell by nearly a third to $11.3 million, according to a document filed with regulators two months after the company reported results that sent its stock tumbling to 2-1/2-year lows. As per Target’s short-term incentive plan, Cornell’s compensation was based on the performance of two financial metrics: incentive EBIT, which makes up 75 percent of Cornell’s stock component, and the rest on adjusted sales.  Target said it missed its 2016 incentive EBIT goal of $5.74 billion by $623 million and fell short of its adjusted sales target of $71.62 billion by $2.13 billion. “This looks pretty normal in terms of executive compensation and, I think, it is actually good executive compensation in a turnaround situation,” said Paul McConnell, managing director at Board Advisory LLC, an executive compensation, performance and succession advisory group.  “You shouldn’t be getting rich when you are producing rotten numbers,” McConnell said. In contrast, bigger rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) gave CEO Doug McMillon a 13 percent pay hike, following strong sales performance at the world’s largest retailer. CEOs of department store operators Macy’s Inc (M.N) and Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N) also received pay hikes, as they met at least one of their intended operational targets for the year. While the pay of Kohl’s CEO Kevin Mansell rose 2.7 percent for 2016, Terry Lundgren, his counterpart at Macy’s, received a 15.3 percent hike. Target, which has been trying to turn itself around by sprucing up existing outlets and opening more smaller format stores, reported a fall in same-store sales for the third straight quarter in February and warned that its sales and profit estimates for 2017 were too high. Target’s stock fell to levels last seen in 2014, following the warning, and is currently down 10 percent in the one year to January 28, 2017. Cornell, who joined Target in 2014, received a total pay package of $28.2 million that year, out of which 97 percent was in stock.

A unanimous three-judge panel of 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that the slurs that Target employees allegedly called plaintiff Mazen Abdel-Ghani, a Palestinian immigrant, including “terrorist,” “camel jockey” and “sand nigger,” were not physically threatening nor did they interfere with his work performance.

846,TGT,Target optimistic on full-year forecast after profit beat,"(Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and sales and set an optimistic tone for the year, saying its full-year profit could come in at the higher end of its forecast. Target’s shares rose 3 percent on Wednesday as the outlook allayed some investor concerns following the company’s warning just three months ago that its full-year targets were too high. The company has been trying to turn around its business for several years and in February vowed to aggressively promote its products and keep grocery prices low to better compete with Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Target is also focusing on opening smaller-format outlets and is investing heavily in its e-commerce business. The company’s online sales rose 22 percent in the first quarter, with the retailer shipping more than 27 percent of those orders from its stores. Target said it invested $500 million as part of its turnaround strategy in the first quarter, and was on track to invest more than $2 billion this year on analytics, supply chain and opening 100 more small-format stores in urban neighborhoods and college markets. Some analysts, however, were not impressed by these efforts. “Q1 does not show signs of major investments, nor does Q2 guidance,” Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman wrote in a note. Gutman, noting a marginal decline in gross margins, said the investments do not seem meaningful for a retailer that has touted “systemwide price investments” and is experiencing a higher mix of online sales. Gross margins fell to 30.5 percent from 30.9 percent. On a post earnings call with analysts, Chief Executive Brian Cornell said it would take time for turnaround to take hold. “Our results are not where we want them to be,” he said. Sales at Target stores open at least a year fell 1.3 percent in the first quarter, rounding up a year of same-store sales declines. Analysts had expected a 3.6 percent decline, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. A rise in demand for swimwear and electronic items such as the Nintendo Switch gaming console as well as the strong performance of its smaller-format stores helped the company beat Wall Street’s muted profit and sales estimates. Excluding items, Target earned a profit of $1.21 per share, while revenue fell 1.1 percent to $16.02 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 91 cents per share on revenue of $15.62 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The investigation — led by the Attorneys General of Connecticut and Illinois — found that cyber attackers had accessed Target’s gateway server through credentials stolen from a third-party vendor, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement on Tuesday. In one of the biggest data breaches to hit a U.S. retailer, Target had reported that hackers stole data from up to 40 million credit and debit cards of shoppers who had visited its stores during the 2013 holiday season. (reut.rs/2qRRMip) California will receive more than $1.4 million from the settlement, the largest share of any state, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said. The costs associated with the settlement are already reflected in the data breach liability reserves that Target has previously recognized and disclosed, the company said in a statement. Target also said the total cost of the data breach had been $202 million. Target spokeswoman Jenna Reck said the company has so far settled with financial institutions and states but is yet to finalize a consumer settlement. “There is a class action settlement that is outstanding. We have reached an agreement but it hasn’t been legally finalized yet.” As part of the settlement announced on Tuesday, Target is required to adopt advanced measures to secure customer information such as employing an executive to oversee a comprehensive information security program as well as advise its chief executive and board. The company is also required to hire a independent, qualified third party to conduct a comprehensive security assessment and encrypt or otherwise protect card information to make it useless if stolen. The Minneapolis-based retailer’s shares were down 0.6 percent at $55.13 in afternoon trade.",5232017,http://www.reuters.com/article/target-cyber-settlement/target-in-18-5-mln-multi-state-settlement-over-data-breach-idUSL1N1IP1ZL
852,TGT,"CEOs of Target, ADM offer differing views on U.S. border tax at hearing","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executive officers of two major American companies - retailer Target Corp and agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland Co - offered opposing views in a hearing before U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday on a proposed border adjustment tax. Target CEO Brian Cornell has been one of the most vocal opponents of the Republican-backed border adjustment tax and testified alongside Juan Luciano, president and CEO of ADM, who spoke in favor of the proposal. The border tax would imposes a tax on imports while providing a credit for exports and has been proposed by House Republicans as part of a larger tax code overhaul. Target is a big importer of goods, while ADM exports.

862,TGT,Target's upbeat forecast drives retail stocks higher,"(Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) forecast sales to increase for the first time in five quarters, thanks to improved customer traffic and sales trends, sending its shares up as much as 4.4 percent and pushing retail stocks higher. Target’s forecast comes days after rival J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) said it was expecting second-quarter sales to significantly improve from the first quarter, pointing to improving demand for bricks-and-mortar retailers. Retailers have been competing fiercely to cut prices in hopes of revitalizing their business as more shoppers switch from traditional stores to online shopping for bigger discounts and convenience. Target and bigger rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) have stepped up their game by investing heavily in e-commerce and offering services such as pick-up-in-store and curbside delivery. Target’s forecast of a “modest” increase in second-quarter same-store sales on Thursday boosted brick-and-mortar retail stocks, which took a beating last month when Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) agreed to buy upmarket grocer Whole Foods Market Inc WFM.O in a deal that could potentially upend the retail market. Macy’s Inc’s (M.N) and Kohl’s Corp’s (KSS.N) shares were up about 4 percent, while Wal-Mart’s were up 1.4 percent. Discount retailer Dollar Tree Inc’s (DLTR.O) shares rose 1.3 percent and Costco Wholesale Corp’s stock (COST.O) was up 1 percent. Target also said it expects second-quarter profit to come in above its forecast range of $0.95 per share to $1.15 per share. “At a minimum, (Target’s forecast) indicates that traditional retailers are not following a straight line directly to irrelevance,” Quo Vadis Capital analyst John Zolidis said, calling Target’s return to positive comparative sales “clearly a good sign.” Zolidis added, however, that it would still take sustained improvement to convince the market that Target had found a “true path forward.” Target’s stock has fallen about 30 percent since the start of the year, dropping to levels last seen in early 2012 due in part to what some analysts consider a confusing grocery offering and an inability to engage customers. In February, the retailer vowed aggressive promotions at a meeting with investors, saying new brands and investments in technology and small stores would help it eventually win back market share.     Anand Raghuraman, principal and retail consultant at EY, said he expected volatility in retail to continue despite these optimistic second-quarter sales forecasts. “It’s safe to say that investors are looking for any sign of positive news in this time of turbulence. There haven’t been many retailers that have escaped the effects of e-commerce and other emerging consumer trends recently,” Raghuraman said. Gordon Haskett analyst Charles Grom said Target’s previous same store sales guidance might have simply been conservative, adding that other retailers, such as Wal-Mart, Costco and Dollar Tree, were still better value.

868,TGT,"Target sales, profit boosted by online traffic; raises outlook","(Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) on Wednesday reported an increase in second-quarter comparable-store sales after four straight negative quarters, driven by improved online traffic and demand across all businesses except groceries. Target shares rose as much as 4 percent after the retailer beat second-quarter profit and same-store sales expectations,  traffic jumped 2.1 percent, and it raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast. Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said comparable sales rose across all Target’s categories during the quarter, except food and beverage, which was flat, an improvement from the decline in the first quarter. “This was one of the top-performing retailers over the last decade. For a little while, it seemed to have lost its way but now appears to be getting back into that ‘Tar-jay’ mode from both a merchandising and an operating perspective,” Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea said, referring to the faux-French pronunciation favored by customers. Like other retailers, Target has struggled to boost traffic amid changing consumer habits and competition from e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Target shares have slid 25 percent since the start of the year, widely lagging larger rival Wal-Mart (WMT.N), whose stock has risen 17 percent. In its latest turnaround bid, Target vowed this year to double the number of small-format stores, invest heavily in e-commerce, aggressively promote its products and keep grocery prices low to compete with Wal-Mart, Amazon and supermarket chain Kroger Co (KR.N). “Probably, the best bang for Target’s buck is a combination of investment in online and grocery,” O’Shea said, adding that Target’s rapidly growing online sales are still only a small fraction of overall revenue. “Food is a very important category. It drives traffic and traffic begets sales of exclusive brands. A lot of Wal-Mart’s success has been the explosion of its food business.” Comparable online sales soared 32 percent in the quarter ended July 29, compared with last year’s 16 percent increase. This helped total comparable sales to rise 1.3 percent, beating the 0.7 percent growth expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix.  Lower pricing and promotions hurt Target’s gross margin rate by about 40 basis points, Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith said on a post-earnings conference call, and could face additional margin pressure for the rest of the year.  Excluding items, the Minneapolis-based retailer earned $1.23 per share in the second quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.19, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 1.6 percent to $16.43 billion, above the average analyst estimate of $16.30 billion. Target raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to $4.34-$4.54 per share from $3.80-$4.20.

869,TGT,"UPDATE 3-Target sales, profit boosted by online traffic; raises outlook","(Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) on Wednesday reported an increase in second-quarter comparable-store sales after four straight negative quarters, driven by improved online traffic and demand across all businesses except groceries. Target shares rose as much as 4 percent after the retailer beat second-quarter profit and same-store sales expectations,  traffic jumped 2.1 percent, and it raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast. Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said comparable sales rose across all Target’s categories during the quarter, except food and beverage, which was flat, an improvement from the decline in the first quarter. “This was one of the top-performing retailers over the last decade. For a little while, it seemed to have lost its way but now appears to be getting back into that ‘Tar-jay’ mode from both a merchandising and an operating perspective,” Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea said, referring to the faux-French pronunciation favored by customers. Like other retailers, Target has struggled to boost traffic amid changing consumer habits and competition from e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Target shares have slid 25 percent since the start of the year, widely lagging larger rival Wal-Mart (WMT.N), whose stock has risen 17 percent. In its latest turnaround bid, Target vowed this year to double the number of small-format stores, invest heavily in e-commerce, aggressively promote its products and keep grocery prices low to compete with Wal-Mart, Amazon and supermarket chain Kroger Co (KR.N). “Probably, the best bang for Target’s buck is a combination of investment in online and grocery,” O’Shea said, adding that Target’s rapidly growing online sales are still only a small fraction of overall revenue. “Food is a very important category. It drives traffic and traffic begets sales of exclusive brands. A lot of Wal-Mart’s success has been the explosion of its food business.” Comparable online sales soared 32 percent in the quarter ended July 29, compared with last year’s 16 percent increase. This helped total comparable sales to rise 1.3 percent, beating the 0.7 percent growth expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix.  Lower pricing and promotions hurt Target’s gross margin rate by about 40 basis points, Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith said on a post-earnings conference call, and could face additional margin pressure for the rest of the year.  Excluding items, the Minneapolis-based retailer earned $1.23 per share in the second quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.19, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 1.6 percent to $16.43 billion, above the average analyst estimate of $16.30 billion. Target raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to $4.34-$4.54 per share from $3.80-$4.20.

873,TGT,"JPMorgan creates joint venture for retail, internet banking -memo","(Reuters) - Merger and acquisition dealmakers make their livings advising companies on mergers, sales and spinoffs. But this time, investment bankers at JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) are working on an internal deal of their own. JPMorgan is creating a joint venture between its consumer and retail, and internet teams, according to an internal memo sent to employees on Thursday and seen by Reuters.  It will be called the disruptive commerce group, and be led by internet banker Chris Grose and retail banker Jill Woodworth.  The memo, signed by Erik Oken, global head of consumer and retail investment banking and Madhu Namburi, head of technology investment banking in North America, was confirmed by a JPMorgan spokeswoman.  The move comes as large, traditional retailers, facing slow growth and shrinking market share, ramp up their digital investments. This includes recent deals such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s (WMT.N) acquisitions of Jet.com, ModCloth and Bonobos; PetSmart’s acquisition of online pet store Chewy; and Target Corp’s (TGT.N) investment in mattress company Casper.  U.S. retail companies spent $17 billion in 2016 acquiring e-commerce companies in 2016, up 63 percent from $10.4 billion in 2012, according to PitchBook Data.  This convergence of retail and technology companies has made establishing traditional sector lines fuzzier for bankers.  For example, Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) recent acquisition of grocery store Whole Foods Market Inc has moved the online retailer closer to traditional brick-and-mortar.  And Peloton, which sells an internet-connected indoor fitness bike, toes the line between whether it might be served by consumer or internet bankers. These types of companies have been covered by both the consumer & retail and internet teams at JPMorgan in the past, but the creation of the new team formalizes this process. It was not clear how a revenue split might work between the two groups through the joint venture.

874,TGT,"Target slashes prices on thousands of items, shares falter","(Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) said on Friday that it lowered prices on thousands of items, from cereal to baby formula, further  hurting retail stocks already pressured by Kroger Co’s (KR.N)  disappointing quarterly results spurred by price cuts. Target, which vowed earlier in the year to aggressively clamp down on prices to compete with rivals Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O), said it had spent months reassessing the prices of everyday items such as milk, eggs, razors and bath tissue. The retailer, which said it would continue to offer discounts on some products in addition to the price-cuts, added that it had also eliminated more than two-thirds of its price and offer call-outs. The retailer’s shares were down as much as 4.7 percent in midday trading on Friday, in-line with a slump among retail stocks after Kroger reported price cuts hurting its bottom line. Target wants to make it easier for customers to spot lower prices by removing the guesswork that comes with temporary deals, Mark Tritton, Target’s chief merchandising officer, said in a blog post. A-Line Partners analyst Gabriella Santaniello said the move might initially cost Target in margins, but that lower prices and fewer temporary price cuts may also drive sales volumes that could eventually offset eroding margins. “At the end of the day people just want everyday lower prices and that is what Target is aiming to do.” When Target first announced in February that it would cut prices and miss full-year profit estimates, its shares plunged to a 2-1/2-year low. Like Target, Kroger, the biggest U.S. supermarket company, has slashed prices on staples such as milk and eggs to fend off competition from Wal-Mart, discounters Lidl and Aldi, and the newly merged Amazon and Whole Foods Market. Amazon.com’s $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods has the grocery industry on edge, worried that the online retail giant could upend the fresh food business in the way it did with books and electronics. Amazon last month lowered prices on some Whole Foods groceries including avocados and beef. “I don’t think this came out of nowhere. (Target) were clearly picking up on the signals and the consumer’s response to Amazon and it is clear to me Amazon encroaching on their space,” A-Line Partners analyst Gabriella Santaniello said. Shares in Amazon were down 0.7 percent, while Wal-Mart was down about 2 percent and Kroger’s stock tumbled nearly 10 percent, hitting a  3-1/2 year low.

876,TGT,"Target to hire 100,000 for holiday season rush","(Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) said on Wednesday it would hire 100,000 workers for the holiday season, up 43 percent from last year, as the retailer pulls out all the stops to build on its recent uptick in sales. The company’s shares rose 3.4 percent as the move, coming off four years of flat seasonal hiring, cheered investors in a gloomy retail landscape where companies are shutting hundreds of stores and cutting jobs. Target posted its first increase in comparable-store sales in five quarters last month, raising expectations that its turnaround plans were taking hold heading into the all-important holiday season. “I think (Target) sees an opportunity to take market share in an environment where we have so many store closures in the specialty apparel and department store space,” said Retail Metrics analyst Ken Perkins. Retailers including Sears Holdings Inc (SHLD.O) and Macy’s Inc (M.N) have announced plans to close hundreds of stores as they struggle with increasing competition from Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and fast-fashion retailers such as Forever 21. Target’s increased store staffing looks to be aimed at preventing loss of sales from customers walking out because of busy checkout lanes or lack of assistance while making purchases, Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea said. Moreover, Target last week lowered prices on thousands of items, a move that could bring in more traffic. “I think they have the potential to have a (better) holiday season than any of their competitors,” Perkins said. Seasonal hiring plans give a glimpse into retailers’ holiday sales expectations as the companies make nearly a third of their annual sales during the period, which starts a day after Thanksgiving and continues into early January. With other major holiday season employers such as Amazon, Macy’s and Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N) yet to announce hiring plans, analysts were divided on whether these companies would emulate Target’s hiring spree. “I would be stunned if we see other retailers increasing their seasonal hiring by 43 percent for the holiday season,” Perkins said. Wal-Mart (WMT.N) has been spending more on paying higher wages and acquiring online retailers and so is unlikely to boost seasonal hiring to the same extent as Target, he said. Other major seasonal employers such as Macy’s and Kohl’s have focused on cutting costs. Moody’s O’Shea, however, said he expects retailers looking to cut costs to hire more temporary workers during the holiday season. “There’s a lot of flexibility in the workforce when you (hire temporary workers)... Hiring seasonal employees is a way to test what you really need.” Retailers could also boost in-store staffing this year as  they are now tasking workers with more activities such as manning shipping and pickup from stores, said Brendan Witcher, principal analyst at Forrester Research. Target also said it would hire 4,500 people for the holiday season at its distribution and fulfillment centers, which supply products to its 1,816 stores and fulfill online orders. The company had hired 7,500 workers at the centers last year as it required additional staffing for three new facilities.

The Minneapolis-based retailer, which plans to start hiking minimum pay across its stores to $11 an hour in October, provided assurances that the move would not hurt its previously announced full-year and quarterly earnings forecasts.  Amid increasing competition for workers in a strengthening labor market, the “Fight for Fifteen” movement — a union-led push for a $15 minimum wage — has been gaining traction in cities across the country. Target’s decision comes less than three months after the Minneapolis City Council approved a measure requiring large companies to pay workers least at $15 an hour by 2022, following decisions by other liberal-leaning U.S. cities to raise the minimum wage.

Amazon slashed prices on select items at Whole Foods on Aug. 28, the day the world’s largest online retailer closed its $13.7 billion purchase of the premium grocer, a move widely expected to upend the food retail business.  On that day, Whole Foods’ customer traffic spiked 31 percent from a year earlier, according to a Thasos Group analysis of location data from millions of mobile phone users. Traffic was up 17 percent during the full week after the price reductions and remained up 4 percent for the following week, ended Sept. 16. According to the Thasos data, 10 percent of Trader Joe’s regular customers visited Whole Foods between Aug. 28 and Sept. 3, more than any other competing chain, followed by Sprouts, with 8 percent. Target Corp (TGT.N) saw 3 percent of customers visit Whole Foods while Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Safeway both saw 2 percent. Although Trader Joe’s and Sprouts saw the greatest percentage of their customers visit Whole Foods, the biggest losers in terms of actual shoppers were Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Kroger Co (KR.N), the leading U.S. grocery sellers with millions of customers. Wal-Mart accounted for 24 percent of Whole Foods’ new customers and Kroger 16 percent, from Aug. 28 through Sept. 3. During that period, 15 percent of shoppers came from Costco, 11 percent were from Target and 5 percent were from Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club. The price reductions did not attract customers outside Whole Foods’ traditional upper-income demographic. They also did not convince consumers to drive longer distances to shop at Whole Foods, said Thasos Group Chief Executive Greg Skibiski, who added that the data used for the Whole Foods competitive analysis includes 10 percent of the U.S. population. “Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods has the potential to be a gamechanger in the grocery space,” Skibiski said. Orbital Insight, which monitors business at about 65 percent of Whole Foods locations, reported a 5 percent year-over-year increase in car traffic to Whole Foods stores in the month since the acquisition closed. Foursquare, which analyzed the mobile phone movements of more than 2.5 million Americans, said traffic to Whole Foods was up about 13 percent the first week after the price cuts and remained up 8 percent after the second week. Shares in Amazon fell 0.3 percent on Tuesday. Target and Sprouts were also down slightly. Shares of Wal-Mart, Kroger and Costco were up modestly.

890,TGT,Target CEO says small-format stores twice as productive as traditional,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sales per square foot at Target Corp’s (TGT.N) 44 small-format stores are “easily double” that at traditional stores, Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell said on Thursday, after the retailer announced 11 new small-format stores opening this week. Target said it recorded an average of $300 in sales per square foot across its stores, compared with at least $600 in sales per square foot from its small-format stores.  In a turnaround bid announced in February, the retailer vowed to double the number of small-format centers, remodel its stores, invest heavily in e-commerce, aggressively promote its products and keep grocery prices low to compete with Wal-Mart (WMT.N), Amazon (AMZN.O) and supermarket chain Kroger Co (KR.N). Target’s more than 70 newly remodeled stores have seen an average 2-4 percent increase in sales since being renovated, Cornell said at a news briefing on Thursday to launch the latest small-format store opposite the Macy’s Inc (M.N) headquarters in Manhattan, New York.     He added, however, that the unexpected success of the small-format and renovated stores would not affect previously announced full-year expected adjusted earnings of $4.34-$4.54 a share, saying these stores still represented a small percentage of overall sales. Cornell said Target aims to operate 130 small-format stores by the end of 2019. Like other retailers, Target has struggled in recent years to boost traffic amid changing consumer habits and competition from e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Still, Target shares have surged more than 10 percent since August, when it reported an increase in second-quarter comparable-store sales after four straight negative quarters, driven by improved online traffic and demand across all businesses except groceries. The retailer has since slashed prices on thousands of items, from cereal to baby formula, and pledged to increase its minimum hourly wage this year by a dollar to $11. “The fact that we’re investing while others are backing away, it’s hard to put into a forecast, but I know it’s improving team engagement,” Cornell said. Retailers, including Sears Holdings Inc (SHLD.O) and Macy’s, have announced plans this year to close hundreds of stores as they struggle with increasing competition from Amazon.com and fast-fashion retailers such as Forever 21.

893,TGT,Target gears up for holidays with free shipping and gifts under $15,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) said on Monday it would start free shipping beginning in November and that most of its gift assortment had been priced at under $15, as the retailer gets ready to take on Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Wal-Mart (WMT.N) in the most crucial shopping season of the year. Target, which has promised about 1,700 gifting products and more than 1,400 toys including “Star Wars,” LEGO and Netflix merchandise and hundreds of $1 stocking stuffers, said it would offer promotional deals during weekends for the last two months of the year. The retailer is also rolling out a service that allows online customers to send friends and family electronic gift boxes that let them make changes to items or select entirely different gifts before they ship. Several industry surveys have indicated that shoppers will spend more on holiday gifting this year, helped by higher online sales and a strong labor market. The Minneapolis-based retailer said in September it was hiring 100,000 temporary holiday workers, up from the 70,000 workers it hired in each of the previous four years. That month, Target also lowered prices on thousands of essential items, from cereal to baby formula, making good its vow from earlier in the year to compete with rivals by aggressively clamping down on prices. Target said its holiday assortment would include more than 1,400 toys, including L.O.L. Surprise! Big Surprise and items from popular Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) show “Stranger Things” and the next “Star Wars” installment, “The Last Jedi.”  “Star Wars” was the U.S. toy industry’s top-selling property for 2015 and 2016, with $1.5 billion in sales over the two years, according to research firm NPD. Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, is also counting on “Star Wars” toy sales this holiday, and has added a large assortment of “Star Wars” products to its holiday layaway program, which allows shoppers to put aside holiday merchandise and make payments in installments.

897,TGT,Amazon rivals turn to legal fine print to stem Whole Foods strategy," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Whole Foods Market met a new foe this summer during talks to lease a top retail space in a San Francisco mall: the Target next door.  As City Center mall’s largest tenant, Target Corp had a say over changes to the property. According to people familiar with the lease discussions, Target balked at sharing the mall with Whole Foods because it feared competition from the grocery chain’s new owner, Amazon.com Inc.  Early attempts to persuade Target failed, and Whole Foods may now have to concede certain Amazon initiatives - such as lockers where customers can pick up goods ordered online - if it wants the location, the people said. Talks are ongoing.  A Reuters examination of real estate agreements and interviews with 20 retail landlords, lawyers and brokers show that the strings attached to operating in malls like City Center present an emerging and little-scrutinized challenge to Amazon’s quest to re-shape Whole Foods.  Across the United States, large retailers including Target, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc and Best Buy Co Inc have legal rights in many lease agreements that allow them to limit what Amazon can do with nearby Whole Foods stores, and where it can open new ones.  Documents reviewed by Reuters show bans on Amazon lockers and delivery operations near a Target store in Illinois and also in Florida, where a new Whole Foods is set to open. Lockers for retrieving online orders are a way for Amazon to spur sales through the grocery chain.  In Manhattan and other locations, the leases of Whole Foods’ big box neighbors bar it from selling a range of goods that Amazon has in its massive online inventory, from electronics to toys and linens.  Even Whole Foods stores that do not share space with major rivals can face constraints imposed by local governments. A city council resolution in White Plains, New York, restricted the hours when Whole Foods can use a loading dock prior to the grocer locating in the mall.  Amazon declined to answer questions about how these restrictions across the country impact its plans.  In a statement, Target said it is “focused on what’s best for the company and delivering on the reasons our guests love Target. Our more than 1,800 stores across the country are a strategic asset and a vital part of Target’s future.”  The company did not discuss details of the restrictions reported by Reuters, but said, “It’s inaccurate to characterize lease agreements as our corporate strategy.”  Reuters could not determine the full extent of limits on Whole Foods stores because lease deals vary from mall to mall, and many are not public. While restricting how neighbors operate is a standard practice in retail, Amazon is new to feeling the heat.  Some mall owners and real estate brokers say Whole Foods will still find landlords who are eager to have the high-profile tenant driving traffic in their malls, and see rivals trying to keep Whole Foods out as short-sighted.  But with nearly all of Whole Foods’ 473 stores subject to lease agreements and plans to add up to 85 stores, according to regulatory filings, Amazon has launched into brick-and-mortar with more constraints and entrenched enemies than in the online world it dominates.  “Many people assume this big, 800-pound gorilla is going to come and beat up all of these retailers,” said Terrison Quinn, a senior vice president at brokerage SRS Real Estate Partners. “I just don’t think that’s going to be the case.”  Amazon wasted no time in making changes when the $13.7 billion Whole Foods deal closed in August. The world’s largest online retailer cut grocery prices, started selling its Echo home speaker in stores and disclosed plans to add lockers to some locations and Whole Foods items to Prime Now, its two-hour delivery program.  Analysts expect such moves will boost online orders and revenue for Amazon. But big box rivals have a number of ways to fight back.  Retailers routinely negotiate guarantees that their landlords will not alter malls in a way that hurts sales, whether leasing to a strip club or starting construction projects without approval, real estate lawyers said.  These leases, which often last 10 to 20 years with options to renew, may even name competitors barred from opening a store.  A 16-page memo in July detailing the lease restrictions governing Miami’s Pinecrest Place mall, obtained by Reuters, offers a glimpse of the legal protections retailers are securing.  Target required an affiliate of national landlord Regency Centers Corp to bar “Any lockers, lock-boxes or other type of storage system that is used to receive or store merchandise from a catalog or online retailer.”  The document then specifies more than a dozen other restrictions for the mall, from leasing space to a pet shop or toy store to operating “a fulfillment center in connection with receiving, storing or distributing merchandise from a catalog or online retailer.”  Regency announced in April that Whole Foods will open in the center, meaning the store cannot have Amazon lockers or fulfill orders for Prime Now.  A May memo of lease for a Target in Evanston, Illinois, obtained by Reuters, contains similar prohibitions against lockers and online fulfillment.  In another case, Target raised similar concerns about Amazon for a prospective Whole Foods location at the Stonestown Galleria in San Francisco, people familiar with the matter said.  A Reuters analysis showed that 7 percent of existing Whole Foods' U.S. stores are within a quarter mile, or roughly five-minute walk, of a Target.  Target is not alone in placing limits on Amazon.  Lidl, a German grocery chain expanding in the United States, said in a deal this year it would “prohibit the operation of pickup facilities” by rivals such as “Wal-Mart and Amazon... that sell grocery items” near a planned store on Long Island in New York, according to a person familiar with the matter. The language is becoming common, the person said.  Will Harwood, a spokesman for Lidl, said, “We adhere to industry norms and standard real estate practices when securing sites.”  A Bed Bath & Beyond store in lower Manhattan bars its next-door tenant - Whole Foods - from selling linens, bathroom items, housewares and frames, its memo of lease said. The company declined to comment.  And a Best Buy store just north of Miami has the exclusive right in its shopping center to sell electronics. A lease carve-out, which states other tenants can sell gadgets on less than 250 square feet of floor space, allowed for the mall’s Whole Foods to display the Echo speaker, according to a memo seen by Reuters and a reporter who visited the location.  “It is pretty standard for anchor tenants of a shopping center to reserve the right in their leases to prohibit improvements to a center - including the addition of new tenants - without approval and consent,” said Jeff Shelman, spokesman for Best Buy.  Gabe Kadosh, vice president at real estate firm Colliers International, said Amazon and Whole Foods “want to have freedom to do whatever they want. The challenge is in brick and mortar, and in multi-tenant shopping centers, you can’t just do that.”  ",10242017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-realestate/amazon-rivals-turn-to-legal-fine-print-to-stem-whole-foods-strategy-idUSKBN1CT0ES

903,TGT,"Target signals another weak holiday quarter, shares tumble","(Reuters) - Target Corp’s (TGT.N) holiday-quarter profit forecast fell short of analyst expectations, sending its shares down 10 percent on Wednesday as hopes faded that the retailer would make a shopping season comeback. Target has missed Wall Street’s fourth-quarter profit expectations for the past two years. It is gearing up for the holidays by cutting prices and introducing delivery options to compete with Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and online sellers, moves that can lure customers but crimp margins. “It was always unrealistic that Target was going to have a great holiday season in terms of sales or profitability,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, noting pressured margins were already expected based on company guidance.  “This is still a very competitive environment, and Target has no choice but to respond to that.. the problem is that Wall Street don’t necessarily understand this,” he added.  The big-box chain forecast adjusted earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 per share for the fourth quarter, a range largely below the average analyst estimate of $1.24. It expects same-store sales in the quarter in a range of flat to 2 percent higher.  The holiday season can represent 20 percent to 40 percent of annual sales for many retailers. In October, Target said most of its holiday gifts would cost less than $15 and that it would offer customers free shipping beginning in November. It also has hired 100,000 temporary holiday workers, up from 70,000 in each of the prior four years, and raised its minimum hourly wage this year by 10 percent.  Target shares have lost about 17 percent since the start of the year and were down 9.2 percent at $54.59 in midday trading. Target’s third-quarter gross margin slipped to 29.7 percent from 29.8 percent, and Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith said margin pressure should continue into the holiday quarter. Target will try to grab more of the lucrative holiday toy market, following the September bankruptcy and ongoing restructuring of Toys “R” Us, the biggest U.S. toy chain. “We are playing to win in toys. We think there is opportunity to expand share,” Chief Executive Brian Cornell said on a media call. Third-quarter same-store sales topped estimates, rising 0.9 percent in the quarter as price cuts drove a 24 percent jump in comparable online sales. Analysts expected a 0.4 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In a turnaround announced in February, Cornell vowed to double the number of small-format stores, invest heavily in e-commerce, aggressively promote products and keep grocery prices low to compete with Wal-Mart, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and supermarket chain Kroger Co (KR.N). Target’s Chief Merchandising Officer Mark Tritton said comparable grocery sales rose slightly, helped by demand for produce. But pricing pressure on groceries is continuing to intensify. Amazon on Wednesday unveiled more discounts on several products at its Whole Foods Market with Thanksgiving around the corner, sending shares in U.S. grocers lower. Excluding items, Target earned a profit of 91 cents per share in the quarter ended Oct. 28, beating the average estimate of 86 cents. Sales rose 1.4 percent to $16.67 billion, topping the average estimate of $16.61 billion.

The U.S. government reported an unexpected rise in crude oil and gasoline stocks, pushing further down oil prices that have been reeling under gloomy global demand outlook. Exxon fell about 1 percent, Schlumberger 1.9 percent and Halliburton 2.7 percent, dragging down the S&P; energy index. Metal prices also slid as data from China stoked fears of a slowdown in the world’s top commodities consumer. “The market often goes through a bit of a ‘what’s next’ in terms of a catalyst. Some of it’s just natural pullback from what has been an extraordinary year,” said Dave Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management. “In recent days, the stock market is taking cues from the bond market, particularly the junk bond market and the constantly changing odds of tax reform passing is also weighing.” The U.S. Treasury yield curve flattened to a 10-year low after data showed a slight pickup in U.S. inflation, as the market priced in further interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve next year. At 12:30 p.m. ET (1630 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 94.85 points, or 0.41 percent, at 23,314.62, the S&P; 500 was down 9.29 points, or 0.36 percent, at 2,569.58 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 23.56 points, or 0.35 percent, at 6,714.32. All three indexes were on track to post their biggest intra-day percentage losses since Nov. 9. The CBOE Volatility index, a widely followed measure of market anxiety, hit a more than 2-month high at 14.51. Among the few gainers were financial stocks, which rose on prospects of further rate hikes. Target shares tumbled 9.32 percent after the retailer issued a disappointing profit forecast for the key holiday quarter.

909,TGT,UPDATE 4-Wal-Mart shares jump on strong U.S. sales growth,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) reported better-than-expected U.S. comparable sales on Thursday, as customers stocked up on food and other supplies ahead of hurricanes and online purchases soared, sending its shares up more than 8.5 percent. The third quarter marked Wal-Mart’s strongest U.S. sales growth since 2009 despite sluggish demand and competition from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) that has hurt brick-and-mortar rivals. The retailer has notched more than three straight years of overall comparable sales growth. “Momentum in the business is really strong,” Wal-Mart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said on an earnings conference call. Hurricane-related sales contributed 30 to 50 basis points to overall comparable sales, the world’s largest retailer said, as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma spurred demand for food and grocery items as well as building materials.  “Food delivered its strongest quarterly performance in six years,” Wal-Mart U.S. Chief Executive Greg Foran said. Wal-Mart has invested in its online business, cut prices and improved its in-store shopping experience by raising worker wages and making stores cleaner and more efficient.  These investments weighed on operating margins and profit, however, which both fell compared to the year-ago quarter. Online sales soared 50 percent, exceeding growth at other big retailers but coming in below the previous quarter’s 60 percent surge.  Those sales added 80 basis points to the quarter’s comparable sales gain, boosted by walmart.com, the retailer’s online grocery delivery service and the acquisition of e-commerce startup Jet.com last year. “Wal-Mart’s online performance continues to validate its substantial investments in this critical channel,” said Moody’s retail analyst Charlie O’Shea.  Wal-Mart forecast strong performance in the key holiday quarter and raised its full-year profit forecast. It now expects earnings per share of $4.38 to $4.46 for the fiscal year versus $4.30 to $4.40 previously. Rival Target Corp (TGT.N) has also slashed prices and invested in its website and delivery, but has been less successful at translating that into sales and profit growth. Its holiday-quarter profit forecast fell short of analysts’ expectations on Wednesday, sending shares down 10 percent.   The holiday shopping season can account for as much as 40 percent of a retailers’ annual sales. Wal-Mart has said it will double down on incentives and has tripled its online selections.  To compete with Amazon, Wal-Mart will offer free two-day shipping on more than two million products when the order exceeds $35 and discounts for online orders picked up at stores. Excluding special items, earnings per share were $1 in the quarter ended Oct. 31, exceeding the average analyst estimate of 97 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Operating income fell 6.9 percent, while operating margins slipped to 3.9 percent from 4.4 percent the same period a year earlier. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 2.7 percent, excluding fuel price fluctuations, topping expectations for a rise of 1.7 percent, according to Consensus Metrix. Net income dropped to $1.75 billion from $3.03 billion a year earlier due to a charge related to retiring higher-rate debt and exiting properties in international markets.  Wal-Mart said it was close to settling a years-long foreign-bribery probe and recorded a $283 million accrual charge related to a settlement. Shares of Wal-Mart were last up 8.4 percent at $97.38. They have risen more than 30 percent so far this year. ",11162017,http://www.reuters.com/article/walmart-results/update-4-wal-mart-shares-jump-on-strong-u-s-sales-growth-idUSL1N1NM0OQ

911,TGT,"Target to buy grocery app Shipt, vows same-day delivery by end-2019","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) will buy grocery delivery platform Shipt Inc for $550 million in cash, it said on Wednesday, promising same-day delivery of all goods by the end of 2019 to lure customers that have turned to online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). The Minneapolis-based big-box retailer said it would roll out same-day delivery for groceries, essentials, home products, electronics and other items at about half its stores by early 2018.  Shipt’s services, which cost $99 a year for unlimited deliveries made by more than 20,000 personal shoppers, will be at most Target stores before the 2018 holiday shopping season, the retailer said. Target, like other traditional retailers, has invested heavily this year in its digital business and delivery options.   Amazon.com’s purchase of Whole Foods has rattled the grocery industry on worries the e-commerce giant will disrupt the  business in the same way it did with books and electronics. “That Target will have this service in place during 2018 will significantly improve its online competitive position as the service is integrated and rolled out to customers,” said Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea. “This is yet another example of a brick-and-mortar retailer leveraging its physical assets to improve its online offerings.” Target, which has been trying to overhaul its grocery business, said the Shipt acquisition would also strengthen its supply chain. Shares in Target were up 1.4 percent in morning trading on Wednesday. “We will move from days to hours, dramatically accelerating our ability to bring affordable same-day delivery to guests across the country,” Target Chief Operating Officer John Mulligan said. He expects the deal to be immaterial to Target’s near-term results and modestly accretive to earnings per share in 2018. Mulligan said Birmingham, Alabama-based Shipt would continue to work with other retailers and provide its services to customers who are not shopping at Target.  Shipt’s founder and Chief Executive Bill Smith said on a call that Target would not have access to data of customers using Shipt to shop at other retailers on the platform, which include Kroger Co (KR.N) and Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O).

915,TGT,"RPT-To thwart Amazon, Kroger and Walmart lure shoppers with curbside pickup","(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Lisa Baertlein LOS ANGELES, Dec 18 (Reuters) - As Amazon.com looks to upend the U.S. grocery market with home delivery, some veteran supermarket operators are betting on a different strategy: curbside pickup. Americans have long loved the convenience of drive-through service for burgers and coffee. Kroger Co and Walmart Inc are tweaking that formula for groceries. The companies have invested heavily in online systems that allow customers to order ahead from their neighborhood store. Workers pick and pack the products, then run them out to shoppers in the parking lot, the grocery version of carry out pizza. For the retailers, the service is cheaper than delivery, because customers do the driving. For shoppers, it means skipping crowds and queues at their local market, and no worries about missing packages or melted ice cream if they are not at home to meet the delivery guy. Tony Sacco, who lives in the Los Angeles beach community of Playa Del Rey, is a regular user of the service at a nearby Ralphs supermarket, owned by Cincinnati-based Kroger. Each pickup costs $6.95, but the time-crunched married father of three says it is worth it. “This is easy. Time is money,” said Sacco, 47, as a worker loaded bags into his SUV on a recent morning. Retaining customers like Sacco is critical for traditional grocery retailers as they battle an array of upstarts bent on turning groceries into the next home-delivery juggernaut. New entrants such as meal-kit company Blue Apron and organic food seller Thrive Market are peeling off coveted slices of their business. Amazon, the nation’s largest online retailer, has amassed an 18 percent share of the $12.6 billion U.S. online grocery market mainly through the sale of packaged goods such as pasta and diapers. It is the largest player in a sector that is expected to grow to $41.7 billion by 2022, according to market research firm Packaged Facts. (For a graphic on U.S. online grocery sales, see tmsnrt.rs/2kwT9OU) But even mighty Amazon has struggled with the trickiest part of the trade: delivering fresh produce, meat, dairy and other perishables. Its AmazonFresh service started more than a decade ago, but has yet to make a major mark. Amazon is making another run at it with its $13.7 billion purchase of upscale grocery chain Whole Foods earlier this year. Amazon has said little about its plans. But analysts expect it will use Whole Foods’ 450 locations as distribution hubs for home delivery, opening a new front in its campaign to disrupt the $700-billion U.S. grocery industry. Old-line players are responding with some new moves of their own. Kroger and Walmart are experimenting with delivery. But they are wagering that pickup is the true sweet spot in the industry’s online evolution. Both are rolling out the service in thousands of their stores. “The way people are going to shop for groceries is going to be curbside, not delivery,” said Jason Goldberg, a senior vice president at digital marketing firm SapientRazorfish. Amazon, too, is eyeing that channel. AmazonFresh has already tested pickup in Seattle and analysts expect Whole Foods to do the same. Nevertheless, researcher Packaged Facts says traditional retailers can win with real estate: “Companies such as Walmart and Kroger have the advantage, because they already have stores all over the country in both urban and rural settings,” it said in a recent report. Kroger bought its way into pickup with its 2014 purchase of southeast grocer Harris Teeter, which had an established program. That same year, Kroger debuted its own offering, known as ClickList, adding features such as coupons and promotions based on detailed customer data. Pickup is now available at 1,000 of the chain’s 2,800 stores and the company is adding the service at 400 to 500 locations a year, according to Matt Thompson, the vice president of ClickList. He said curbside customers spend 40 percent to 60 percent more than traditional shoppers, because they tend to stock up on bulky items such as bottled water. Users pay $4.95 to $6.95 for each order depending on their location. Kroger would not disclose how many shoppers use ClickList. It promotes the service in stores and online, while customers spread the word through social media. Users log into ClickList online. They put items into digital carts, pay and reserve a pickup time at least four hours in advance. The order is sent to a terminal in a store’s dedicated ClickList room, where “pickers” are dispatched with handheld devices that tell them exactly where to find each item. These workers bag the products and put them into labeled bins; perishables are kept in a nearby freezer or fridge. When customers pull into designated pickup parking spaces, they are directed to call a number to alert a ClickList staffer, who wheels the bags to their cars. Kroger gave Reuters a tour of its ClickList operation at a Ralphs supermarket in Los Angeles’ Westchester neighborhood in late November. Miguel Lopez, who leads the ClickList team there, said it takes about 30 minutes to pick a $100 order; a $400 order takes an hour. The team tracks progress on a white board that showed weekly progress since the service debuted in January. The number of daily orders ranged from 13 to 36. Sales for the week Reuters visited, which included Thanksgiving Day, were on pace to hit a record of more than $12,000. Analysts say typical Kroger stores have annual sales of around $30 million, excluding gasoline. Deutsche Bank analyst Shane Higgins said pickup already accounts for over 5 percent of sales in some locations. Kroger declined to comment on the overall performance of ClickList but acknowledged costs are initially higher for pickup orders because of the additional labor involved. Company executives said increasing sales and efficiency can virtually eliminate that gap in as little as three years. Another challenge to profitability is that pickup customers are not tempted by in-store impulse items. But the biggest risk, analysts say, is to do nothing and let customers drift to competitors that offer the service. Shopper Kimberlee Isaacs says ClickList has kept her loyal to the Westchester Ralphs, where she drops $800 a month on groceries for her family of three. “We use it every single week. I don’t go into the store unless I forgot something,” Isaacs, 50, said. Meanwhile, Walmart, the nation’s top grocery seller, aims to add free curbside pickup at 1,000 stores next year, bringing the total to 2,100 of its 4,700 U.S. locations. It declined to discuss profitability of the service. But spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said the company decided to expand it quickly based on encouraging results. Pickup is winning converts such as Hudson, Florida shopper Steve Mondock, who had previously shunned Walmart. “I hated the crowds, I hated the parking,” said Mondock, 55, who now buys most of his basics there. Virtually every food retailer is now testing or adding pickup, including Publix, HEB, Meijer and Safeway. Target Corp , which just bought delivery company Shipt, is testing drive up for non-perishable groceries and other items. “That’s why you want to be early so you can capture someone else’s customers,” said Loop Capital analyst Andrew Wolf.

916,TGT,"To thwart Amazon, Kroger and Walmart lure shoppers with curbside pickup","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - As Amazon.com looks to upend the U.S. grocery market with home delivery, some veteran supermarket operators are betting on a different strategy: curbside pickup.    Americans have long loved the convenience of drive-through service for burgers and coffee. Kroger Co (KR.N) and Walmart Inc (WMT.N) are tweaking that formula for groceries.     The companies have invested heavily in online systems that allow customers to order ahead from their neighborhood store. Workers pick and pack the products, then run them out to shoppers in the parking lot, the grocery version of carry out pizza.    For the retailers, the service is cheaper than delivery, because customers do the driving. For shoppers, it means skipping crowds and queues at their local market, and no worries about missing packages or melted ice cream if they are not at home to meet the delivery guy.     Tony Sacco, who lives in the Los Angeles beach community of Playa Del Rey, is a regular user of the service at a nearby Ralphs supermarket, owned by Cincinnati-based Kroger. Each pickup costs $6.95, but the time-crunched married father of three says it is worth it.      “This is easy. Time is money,” said Sacco, 47, as a worker loaded bags into his SUV on a recent morning.     Retaining customers like Sacco is critical for traditional grocery retailers as they battle an array of upstarts bent on turning groceries into the next home-delivery juggernaut.     New entrants such as meal-kit company Blue Apron and organic food seller Thrive Market are peeling off coveted slices of their business. Amazon (AMZN.O), the nation’s largest online retailer, has amassed an 18 percent share of the $12.6 billion U.S. online grocery market mainly through the sale of packaged goods such as pasta and diapers. It is the largest player in a sector that is expected to grow to $41.7 billion by 2022, according to market research firm Packaged Facts. (For a graphic on U.S. online grocery sales, see tmsnrt.rs/2kwT9OU)     But even mighty Amazon has struggled with the trickiest part of the trade: delivering fresh produce, meat, dairy and other perishables. Its AmazonFresh service started more than a decade ago, but has yet to make a major mark.         Amazon is making another run at it with its $13.7 billion purchase of upscale grocery chain Whole Foods earlier this year. Amazon has said little about its plans. But analysts expect it will use Whole Foods’ 450 locations as distribution hubs for home delivery, opening a new front in its campaign to disrupt the $700-billion U.S. grocery industry.    Old-line players are responding with some new moves of their own. Kroger and Walmart are experimenting with delivery. But they are wagering that pickup is the true sweet spot in the industry’s online evolution. Both are rolling out the service in thousands of their stores.     “The way people are going to shop for groceries is going to be curbside, not delivery,” said Jason Goldberg, a senior vice president at digital marketing firm SapientRazorfish.     Amazon, too, is eyeing that channel. AmazonFresh has already tested pickup in Seattle and analysts expect Whole Foods to do the same.     Nevertheless, researcher Packaged Facts says traditional retailers can win with real estate: “Companies such as Walmart and Kroger have the advantage, because they already have stores all over the country in both urban and rural settings,” it said in a recent report.     Kroger bought its way into pickup with its 2014 purchase of southeast grocer Harris Teeter, which had an established program.      That same year, Kroger debuted its own offering, known as ClickList, adding features such as coupons and promotions based on detailed customer data.      Pickup is now available at 1,000 of the chain’s 2,800 stores and the company is adding the service at 400 to 500 locations a year, according to Matt Thompson, the vice president of ClickList.      He said curbside customers spend 40 percent to 60 percent more than traditional shoppers, because they tend to stock up on bulky items such as bottled water.    Users pay $4.95 to $6.95 for each order depending on their location. Kroger would not disclose how many shoppers use ClickList. It promotes the service in stores and online, while customers spread the word through social media.     Users log into ClickList online. They put items into digital carts, pay and reserve a pickup time at least four hours in advance. The order is sent to a terminal in a store’s dedicated ClickList room, where “pickers” are dispatched with handheld devices that tell them exactly where to find each item. These workers bag the products and put them into labeled bins; perishables are kept in a nearby freezer or fridge. When customers pull into designated pickup parking spaces, they are directed to call a number to alert a ClickList staffer, who wheels the bags to their cars.      Kroger gave Reuters a tour of its ClickList operation at a Ralphs supermarket in Los Angeles’ Westchester neighborhood in late November.

917,TGT,Amazon's allure may be tough to top this holiday -poll,"CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - More U.S. online shoppers plan to give Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) the bulk of their holiday business this year than in previous years, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll, despite costly efforts by traditional retailers to attract customers to their websites.  The online poll of 2,644 adults, released on Wednesday, found that 60 percent of online shoppers planned to do most of their holiday buying on Amazon.com, up from 50 percent during the same period in 2015. Meanwhile, the proportion of shoppers who said they expected to do most of their shopping at Walmart.com, Target.com and Macys.com declined by about 1 percentage point each in that period. Consumers opting increasingly for convenience and speedy delivery have already pushed online sales this holiday season to record highs, making it all the more crucial that retailers get their digital businesses into gear. Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Target Corp (TGT.N) and Macy’s Inc (M.N), like many of their peers, have invested in deeper online discounts and free shipping this holiday season, potentially hurting fourth-quarter profit margins to win back customers who have turned increasingly to Amazon.com. Retailers have also invested heavily in sprucing up their websites and mobile device apps. They are rolling out more fulfillment options such as curbside pickup, click-and-collect and same-day delivery. The holiday shopping season can account for 20 to 40 percent of annual sales for many retailers. Anand Raghuraman, EY’s Americas leader for consumer products and retail strategy, said traditional retailers’ online sales were growing, but not fast enough to win market share.  “They’re dealing with an 800-pound gorilla that has different metrics around profitability than they do, which is tough to compete with,” said Raghuraman.  Earnest Research, which looks at anonymous card transactions made by millions of U.S. shoppers, said data from the two weeks after Thanksgiving showed Amazon’s market share of U.S. sales  had risen 2.6 percent from the same period last year. Meanwhile Walmart’s in-store and online market share for the period was down 1.7 percent, while Target had lost 0.6 percent  and Macy’s was down 0.5 percent, according to Earnest.  Target expects fourth-quarter digital growth to once again be among the best in the industry, spokesman Joshua Thomas said. Macy’s spokeswoman Radina Russell said the department store chain had begun the holiday season well and would continue to offer value online and in stores. Walmart did not immediately provide comment. To be sure, analytics firms and industry groups expect most traditional retailers to report higher holiday sales this year, both online and in stores, driven by discounting, low unemployment, rising consumer confidence and good weather across the country. Sales on Thanksgiving and Black Friday also topped prior years and Amazon.com said it broke sales records during that holiday weekend. According to the Reuters/Ipsos poll, about one in every four adults plan to shop primarily or entirely online this holiday season, up from one in five in 2012. Convenience, delivery and the ability to compare prices easily were the most common reasons people choose to shop online, the poll showed. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted in English throughout the United States from Nov. 27 to Dec. 7. Because it is an online poll, the respondents may be more experienced with computers and online shopping than the general public. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points.

919,TGT,Target lifts profit forecast after holiday sales jump,"(Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) raised its quarterly profit and sales forecasts on Tuesday on the back of surging online sales and customer visits in November and December, putting the U.S.  retailer on track for the best quarter in five years.     The Minneapolis-based chain, whose shares closed up 3 percent at $69.14, raised its fourth-quarter profit forecast to $1.30-$1.40 per share from an earlier range of $1.05-$1.25. That was well above analysts’ average forecast of $1.22 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Target is slated to have poured $1 billion of last year’s profits into an effort to boost sales, mainly by investing in online business and delivery options to take on Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).  It has hired more staff, remodeled existing stores and focused on building small-format stores to reach more customers in suburbs.        On Tuesday, the company said same-store sales rose 3.4 percent in November and December and that its online sales growth was on track to report its fourth straight year of more than 25 percent gains.  “Target’s brick-and-mortar customers are growing in their affinity to the Target online interface, pricing on hot products in the fourth quarter and the ability to deliver in time,” Jim Fosina, chief executive of Fosina Marketing Group, said.  The lack of strong retail and online players who sell both toys and electronics is likely to have helped the company keep its loyalists away from Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) or bankrupt Toys R Us, Fosina said.  Target raised its same-store sales growth forecast for the quarter ending January to 3.4 percent, from a prior forecast of flat to up 2 percent.   Research firm Retail Metrics’ President Ken Perkins said that, if that target were met, it would be the company’s strongest quarterly gain since the first quarter of 2012. Target’s is the latest in a run of relatively upbeat holiday sales numbers from brick-and-mortar retailers who have suffered most from the huge gains made by Amazon and other online retailers over the past decade. Department store chain Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) late on Tuesday reported a 1.2 percent rise in comparable store sales for November and December, helped in part by growth in online sales. The upscale retailer also lifted the low end of its full-year earnings per share forecast by 5 cents to $2.90, keeping the top end unchanged at $2.95. Shares of department store chain Kohl’s (KSS.N) on Monday surged after it reported a 6.9 percent rise in same-store sales for the same months.  Target said same-store sales in November and December gained in all five of its core merchandise categories: home, apparel, food & beverage, hardlines and essentials.    Kitchen items from brands like Threshold, KitchenAid and Keurig, and cordless vacuums from Roomba and Dyson were popular gifting items.  An exclusive furniture and household goods brand, co-designed by TV personalities Chip and Joanna Gaines, was also a hit after launching in November, the company said.  Target’s fourth-quarter profit forecast includes a 6 cent to 8 cent benefit from the newly approved reduction in Federal corporate tax rates.

Stocks continued their winning streak in 2018 as investors remained hopeful about global economic growth and tax-cut led gains for corporate earnings in a low interest rate environment. “So long as inflation remains at around these levels, it will certainly support the mutiples that we have,” said Tim Dreiling, regional investment director for The Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank. “We’ll watch inflation to see if that unexpectedly rises and could cause some concerns about earnings compression.” After a lukewarm December jobs report, investors will look for fresh signs of pickup in inflation from the monthly consumer price data due on Friday.

But investors are starting to prepare for the next round of earnings that could keep the market on fire,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. “People are going to look for what is going to create opportunity for more money to flow into equity.” Investors are waiting for the start of the quarterly earnings season for more readings on the impact of recent tax cuts and profit forecasts. Earnings for S&P; 500 companies are expected to rise 11.8 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with an 8 percent increase a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Seven of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, led by a 0.9 percent gain in financial stocks. JPMorgan and Bank of America rose more than 0.8 percent and Goldman Sachs 1 percent. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose to their highest since March. Advanced Micro Devices slipped 4.15 percent after Microsoft suspended patches to guard against security threats for computers running AMD chipsets after complaints that the software updates froze their machines. GoPro fell 6.7 percent, extending losses from Monday after the action camera-maker flagged a weak holiday quarter that triggered sale talks. The company said it was not actively trying to sell itself but would be willing to partner with a larger sector player. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,381 to 1,141. On the Nasdaq, 1,363 issues rose and 1,092 fell. ",1092018,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks/us-stocks-wall-st-hits-new-record-at-open-on-healthcare-bank-gains-idUSL4N1P448T

932,TGT,Toys are not us: Target investors," (Refiles Feb. 22 story to attribute analyst data in paragraph 3 and 10 to UBS analyst Arpine Kocharyan) By Uday Sampath Kumar (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) should hold off on plans to cash in on a perceived advantage in toys after the collapse of Toys “R” Us, several of the company’s investors told Reuters, worried it could eat up capital desperately needed in an Amazon-dominated retail world.  When the biggest toy retailer in the U.S. went bankrupt last September, analysts parsing through the wreckage came to the conclusion that Target would be among the biggest beneficiaries.  Of the 182 Toys “R” Us stores scheduled to close in the first half of 2018, 93 percent are within a 15-minute drive of at least one Target store, UBS analyst Arpine Kocharyan said and analysts say the department-store chain should see more traffic as a result. The Minneapolis-based company was already in the middle of a push that saw it add 1,400 new toys to its catalog in 2017 and Wall Street brokerages say it could see a 30-45 basis point jump in overall group sales as a consequence of the bankruptcy. “We are playing to win in toys. We think there is opportunity to expand share,” Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said on a conference call last November. Target has also launched a number of exclusive toys including a board game based on Bob Ross’s Joy of Painting TV show and introduced a line of action figures based on characters from Netflix’s (NFLX.O) smash hit “Stranger Things”.  The investors who spoke to Reuters in the past month were not convinced.  “We do not believe Target should invest more in selling national brand toys, and Target’s toys business is not core to our investment thesis,” said Jack Leslie, a portfolio manager for Miller/Howard Investments Portfolio, who holds a $96 million stake in Target. Target declined to say how much it is spending on toy advertising and repositioning itself, but the company did lay out plans last year to spend $2 billion on promotions, stores and technology to fight other retailers head on.     UBS’s Kocharyan estimated the company could get a 0.4-0.45 percent boost in revenue even if it only managed to capture 25 percent of the sales lost by Toys “R” Us. Target’s stock, down over 10 percent in 2017, has recovered those losses to trade up 11.7 percent this year. Yet the picture is cloudy and complicated by the Toys “R” Us restructuring and the underlying factors behind its bankruptcy.  The toy chain collapsed mainly by its inability to service a huge debt load piled on it by its private equity buyers, KKR & Co LP (KKR.N) and Bain Capital LP, amid tepid sales and a broader shift toward online shopping.     Sector analysts are unsure how long it will take Toys “R” Us to emerge from bankruptcy.  If Target wants to get, and as importantly, keep the customers Toys “R” Us lost, then it will need to invest solidly in marketing itself as a major toy retailer. At the same time there is the Amazon factor that continues to upend the traditional retailing industry everyday.  “The toy category is not a growth category,” said Steven Roorda, an analyst and portfolio manager with Minnesota-based Stonebridge Capital Advisors, who has covered Target for 30 years and owns shares of the company. “U.S. birth rates are moderating and along with children using other devices to access entertainment at an earlier age (that) means that the toy category has been under pressure as evidenced by what is going on with (toymaker) Mattel.” Four of the institutional investors who Reuters spoke to said they would rather see Target focus on exclusive private-label brands, expanding its online business and open more stores next to urban campuses to make it “un-Amazonable”.  “Is Target going to improve its business, improve its traffic and will there be a halo effect from selling more toys. I think the answer is yes, yes and yes,” said John Tompkins, a portfolio manager at Tyvor Capital, which owns more than 300,000 shares in the retailer.  “Would I raise my stake specifically related to this because I think their toy business is going to get better, no.” ",2232018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-target-toys-investors/toys-are-not-us-target-investors-idUSKCN1G61KY

935,TGT,Target sees margins stabilizing in year ahead as profit disappoints,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) said on Tuesday it expects profit margins to stabilize in the year ahead even as they are pressured by investments in store and online operations, sending its shares down more 4 percent in afternoon trading. To spur growth, Target is revamping its supply chain, strengthening online delivery services, investing in its own brands and employees, and connecting its online and store shopping experiences for customers, Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said at an investor meeting at Target’s headquarters in Minneapolis. Earlier in the day, the retailer reported fourth-quarter profit that missed estimates, gross margins that were at their lowest in 20 years, and gave a disappointing forecast for first-quarter comparable sales. Shares were down 4 percent at $72.10 after earlier sinking more than 5 percent. “2017 was all about putting down a plan, getting the wheels turning in the right direction,” Cornell said. “2018 is about acceleration, leveraging our greatest assets and leaning in to our competitive strength.”  The retailer plans $3 billion of capital expenditure this year to support those investments, remodel stores and strengthen online operations to stay competitive. In February last year, Target said it would reinvest more than $7 billion through 2020. The company said it would introduce free two-day shipping without a membership requirement, following larger rival Walmart Inc (WMT.N), which introduced the feature last year on orders of $35 or more. Target did not say if the free shipping was conditional upon a minimum order of a certain value. Target said more than half its online order volume was shipped or picked up from stores, a key factor driving online sales growth of 29 percent during the fourth quarter. That made it a fourth straight annual jump in online sales of more than 25 percent in the year through Feb. 3. Earlier in the day, Target missed fourth-quarter earnings expectations for a third consecutive year. Looking forward, the company expects only modest comparable sales growth in the low single digits for the first quarter, with analysts expecting 2.36 percent. It expects adjusted earnings of $1.25 to $1.45 per share, against analyst estimates for $1.40 per share. For the full year, Target reiterated its forecast from January, expecting adjusted earnings of $5.15 to $5.45 a share, compared to analyst estimates for $5.27 per share. The earnings miss bucked strong fourth-quarter results from rival brick-and-mortar retailers like Macy’s Inc (M.N), Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N) and Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N), who have suffered the most from the market-share gains made by Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) over the past decade. Profit margins were further eroded by a hike in employee wages in the fourth quarter. In October, the company said it would raise wages for hourly workers to $15 by 2020 and as part of that plan, will raise them to $12 per hour this spring. In a bid to fend off rivals, Target has focused on doubling the number of its small-format stores, aggressive product promotions and keeping grocery prices low. On Tuesday, it said it will remodel 1,000 stores by 2020.    Excluding items, Target earned $1.37 per share in the fourth quarter ended Feb.3, just shy of average analyst estimates for $1.38. Gross margins stood at 26.2 percent, lower than 26.6 percent a year earlier. Quarterly comparable sales grew 3.6 percent, beating expectations and was its strongest performance since the first quarter of 2012, thanks to higher customer traffic at both stores and online. Analysts expected a 3.1 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Sales grew 10 percent to $22.77 billion, topping the average estimate of $22.53 billion, helped by an additional week in the fourth quarter.

Neither companies was immediately available for comment. The companies first started talks last summer about a partnership that could improve Target’s grocery business and give Kroger customers more access to merchandise and e-commerce, the report said. While the talks started once again in 2018, the two companies appear to be struggling to decide whether a merger is the best path forward, the report said. Shares of Kroger rose 8 percent in premarket trading on Friday while that of Target was trading up 2.8 percent. Kroger has a market cap of $20.62 billion and Target $37.12 billion.

950,TGT,"Come for your drugs, leave with more shopping: Walmart's new growth strategy?","(Reuters) - Walmart Inc’s (WMT.N) efforts to develop closer ties with health insurer Humana Inc (HUM.N), which came to light on Thursday, point to a brave new world of retail where superstores become healthcare centers offering basic medical care. They are also aimed at boosting Walmart’s slowing growth in brick-and-mortar store sales as it faces increasing pressure online from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).     Deepening its existing partnership with Humana, or even acquiring the company outright, could be a step toward turning its 4,700 or so U.S. stores into healthcare centers that aim to attract more shoppers over 65. “The end goal here is to get more people in their stores, get them to buy drugs and make an additional purchase while they are in the store,” said Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC, who owns shares of Walmart. If Walmart can offer “competitive rates” on primary care and other health services, he said, it “can grow traffic and push store visits.” Walmart approached Humana this month, and the companies began to discuss closer ties focused on new partnerships, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. An acquisition of Humana by Walmart is also being discussed, the sources said.  Walmart declined comment Friday. Humana could not immediately be reached for comment. Closer ties between the two could enable the retailer to tap into Humana’s patient roster and possibly put some of its physician clinics in stores to offer medical care to customers. Walmart is the largest retailer to hit upon the combination of retail and health insurance, but it is not the first.  CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) has struck a $69 billion deal to acquire Aetna Inc (AET.N). Separately, insurer Cigna Corp (CI.N) has a $54 billion deal to buy pharmacy benefits company Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O). The two deals, if approved, will put pressure on the entire health care supply chain.  Humana could provide Walmart with “one more way to checkmate Amazon and equal and eclipse the CVS/Target partnership and equal and eclipse the CVS/Aetna partnership,” said Burt Flickinger at marketing consulting firm Strategic Resource Group. “It allows them to get ahead of everybody from warehouse club operators like Costco, Target and other retailers who run chain drugstores as well as food and drug combo operators like Kroger and Wegmans.” Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart already has pharmacies at many store locations and has a co-branded drug plan with Humana that caters to patients using Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people over 65. That plan steers patients to Walmart stores for their pharmacy needs, offering customers an opportunity to save up to 20 percent on drug costs, analysts said.  Louisville, Kentucky-based Humana is one of the country’s largest providers of Medicare Advantage plans - a type of coverage offered by a private company that contracts with Medicare. Humana has 5.1 million seniors on prescription drug benefits and another 3.5 million on full medical benefits, according to Ana Gupte, senior health care analyst with Leerink Partners in New York.  Walmart superstores “could be a one-stop shop for seniors,” said Gupte, adding that Humana already has about 50 pharmacies sharing locations with doctors’ clinics, and could expand that model using Walmart’s real estate and pharmacies.  There is also a potential for Walmart and Humana to benefit from their mass of customer data, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.  “One thing retailers have is a very good understanding of customers. They know their eating habits and other consumption patterns and that is quite useful in forming insurance decisions,” he said. “That is certainly something that Walmart would be able to leverage.”  Humana patients are most likely already heavy shoppers at Walmart, according to David Friend at the BDO Center for Healthcare Excellence and Innovation.  “If you know that somebody is on a certain medicine you can sell them other products and services and that will help keep customer loyalty,” he said.

952,TGT,"Target settles claims it screened blacks, Hispanics out of jobs","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Target Corp has agreed to review its policies for screening job applicants and pay $3.74 million to settle a lawsuit claiming its use of criminal background checks kept thousands of blacks and Hispanics from obtaining employment. The preliminary settlement filed on Thursday with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan requires a judge’s approval. It resolves claims that Target, which has performed background checks for employment in U.S. stores since 2001, “imported the racial and ethnic disparities” in U.S. criminal justice system into its hiring, in part by disqualifying job applicants for convictions unrelated to the work they sought. The Minneapolis-based retailer was accused of violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employers from discriminating based on race, gender and other characteristics. Thursday’s settlement calls for experts to review Target’s guidelines for using criminal histories in hiring, and help the retailer implement appropriate changes. Eligible blacks and Hispanics who were since May 2006 wrongly denied hourly and entry-level jobs such as cashiers, cart attendants, food service workers and stockers will receive $1.2 million or “priority hiring.” Another $600,000 will fund nonprofits that help people with criminal histories reenter the workforce, while most of the remaining payout will cover legal and other fees, the settlement said. Target did not admit wrongdoing. Jenna Reck, a Target spokeswoman, said the retailer no longer asks for criminal histories in job applications, but still considers convictions “important” and gathers criminal background information late in the hiring process. “We have a number of measures in place to ensure we’re fair and equitable in our hiring,” while “maintaining a safe and secure working and shopping environment for team members and guests,” she said. The plaintiffs included Carnella Times and Erving Smith, who are black and claimed they were denied stocker jobs after background checks uncovered past convictions, and The Fortune Society, which helps former prisoners reenter society. That group last year filed a similar discrimination charge against Macy’s Inc with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The plaintiffs were represented by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund (“LDF”), and the law firm Outten & Golden. “Criminal background information can be a legitimate tool for screening job applicants,” but Target’s background checks were “harmful to many qualified applicants who deserved a fair shot at a good job,” LDF President Sherrilyn Ifill said in a statement.

956,TGT,Domino's unveils pizza delivery 'hotspots' as competition rages,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Domino’s Pizza Inc (DPZ.N) is ramping up the food delivery wars, adding online ordering for more than 150,000 new delivery “hotspots” at U.S. parks, beaches and other destinations that do not have traditional addresses. Executives say the move opens new sales opportunities for the company, a pioneer and dominant player in restaurant delivery, as traditional eateries and supermarkets face pressure from third-party delivery “disruptors” that are flush with venture capital or subject to less stringent expectations when it comes to profits.  “We know that delivery is all about convenience, and Domino’s Hotspots are ... all about flexible delivery options,”  said Russell Weiner, president of Domino’s USA.  While customers previously could ask Domino’s to deliver to offbeat locations, the initiative establishes set drop-off points that customers can find with the location services on their smartphones.  This will help customers order via Dominos.com and the chain’s mobile app, said Dennis Maloney, the chain’s chief digital officer. Such orders previously were only available by  telephone.   Customers pre-pay the orders, select a location from a menu and have the option to add instructions to help drivers identify them. Domino’s texts them order status updates, including estimated arrival times. Customers also supply mobile phone numbers in the event of a hiccup, he said. Despite the company’s name for them, the locations are not wifi hotspots.  Domino’s declined to disclose costs related to the project and said it had no immediate plans to hire additional drivers. Roughly 60 percent of its orders are digital and Domino’s delivers around 65 percent of overall orders. U.S. sales from third-party restaurant and grocery delivery services are forecast to nearly double within five years, significantly outpacing growth in the U.S. food industry overall. Strategy firm Pentallect Inc expects the third-party food delivery industry’s sales to grow from $13 billion in 2017 to $24.5 billion by 2022. The firm say the industry has a 13.5 percent annual growth rate, versus the 3 percent rate for the U.S. food industry overall.  Restaurant delivery companies GrubHub Inc (GRUB.N), UberEats and DoorDash, the latter of which has raised funding totaling $722 million, are in a fierce battle to win the segment that was once the domain of national pizza chains like Domino’s, Papa John’s (PZZA.O) and Yum Brands’ (YUM.N) Pizza Hut. At the same time, Whole Foods owner Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Target Corp-owned (TGT.N) Shipt and Instacart, which has raised about $1 billion, are shaking up the grocery industry with home delivery.   While venture capital firms and deep-pocketed retailers invest heavily in third-party delivery, many restaurant operators are weighing whether it is best to work with outside delivery providers who take a percentage of sales, often 15 to 30 percent, or to spend the money to do it themselves.       McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) is partnering with UberEats for delivery in the United States, even though its stores in China and elsewhere dispatch their own delivery drivers - often on scooters.  Panera Bread Co, which has spent about $150 million on technology that underpins delivery and other services, has built its own U.S. delivery service. It hired 10,000 drivers in 2017 and is on track to do the same this year.   Restaurants lose margin “every time you have more hands in your pocket,” Panera CEO Blaine Hurst said, referring to third-party services.  Nevertheless, the chain continues to experiment with third-party delivery companies as it looks for better, more efficient ways to provide the service, Hurst said.  Yum, which also owns the Taco Bell and KFC brands, took a different tack earlier this year, spending $200 million to buy a 3 percent stake in GrubHub.
