1,DWDP,DowDuPont alters post-merger breakup plans amid investor pressure,"(Reuters) - DowDuPont, formed through the merger of chemical giants Dow Chemical and DuPont, is shifting some operations in the three units it plans to create, potentially averting a prolonged fight with activist investors over its post-merger plans. Dow and DuPont will split into three companies focusing on agriculture, specialty chemicals and materials, but some investors including Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners and Daniel Loeb’s Third Point LLC urged the companies to take another look at the way business units are aligned. The company said on Tuesday its would now move businesses totaling more than $8 billion in annual sales from its materials science division to the specialty-chemical unit, including water purification and automotive systems. “We expect that this updated portfolio was seen by legacy Dow as the bare minimum to avoid an activist fight,” Bernstein analyst Jonas Oxgaard wrote in a client note. DowDuPont’s shares rose 2.5 percent on the New York Stock Exchange in late-afternoon trading. The changes were the result of a four-month review led by consultancy firm McKinsey & Co, which talked to 25 of the company’s biggest shareholders, Andrew Liveris, executive chairman of the combined company said in an interview. Liveris was formerly chief executive of Dow, and is set to retire from DowDuPont next year. Loeb’s Third Point, which has been critical of Liveris’ leadership, said in May the companies could unlock $20 billion in additional value by tweaking the original spinoff plan. As part of the revised plan, DowDuPont will split the old Dow Corning and distribute its lucrative silicone business among the materials and specialty companies. Earlier, this business was expected to stay under the materials science division - which will account for more legacy Dow businesses and retain the Dow brand. The business produces silicon-based products for aerospace, automotive and electrical industries. The materials science company will be the biggest in terms of revenue generation, Liveris said, followed by the chemicals and agriculture businesses.  Peltz’s Trian said it fully supports the portfolio adjustments announced by DowDuPont. “Since we first became involved in the merger discussions in November 2015, we planned to help the company execute this critical review at the appropriate time. We believe this is a great outcome for shareholders.” The merger is expected to save around $3 billion for the companies. Minority shareholder Glenview Capital Management said DowDuPont’s move was “an important first step” but leaves the company significantly undervalued, and recommended share buybacks.

6,DWDP,DowDuPont set to beat quarterly estimates as new company,"(Reuters) - DowDuPont (DWDP.N), formed by the merger of chemical giants Dow Chemical and DuPont, revealed third-quarter profit estimates on Thursday that were much higher than Wall Street’s expectations ahead of the combined company’s first earnings report next week. Shares of the world’s largest chemical maker rose 2 percent, hitting their highest since they started trading on Sept. 1. The preliminary figures offered investors an early look into the performance of the combination, which brought together an array of businesses that make chemicals for industries including automobiles, cosmetics and agriculture. DowDuPont said it expects to have earned 55 cents per share on an adjusted pro forma basis in the third quarter, up 10 percent from last year. Analysts are currently expecting 40 cents per share on average. The merger has been seen by analysts as a way to streamline the companies’ sprawling operations by combining overlapping businesses. “Improving culture within the companies is helping topline growth,” analyst Jonas Oxgaard of Bernstein said. Dow and DuPont had both been struggling with growth before they made the decision to merge in 2015. The company said the quarter benefited from higher prices for its products and strong demand for chemicals used by the consumer sector, offsetting hurricanes and weak crop planting conditions in Brazil. Overall sales rose 8 percent on a proforma basis to $18.3 billion. The results were more positive than it looks, given the company had already factored in hurricanes and troubles in Brazil, said Laurence Alexander, chemical sector analyst with Jefferies. The company had earlier said its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization would be reduced about $250 million due to Hurricane Harvey.

16,DWDP,UPDATE 1-French court suspends two Dow pesticides over potential harm to bees,"PARIS (Reuters) - A French court suspended on Friday the licence for two pesticides made by Dow Chemical, citing uncertainty over environmental risks including their effects on bees. The preliminary ruling by an administrative court in the city of Nice overturned a decision by France’s health and environment agency ANSES in September to grant a permit for the Closer and Transform crop chemicals, which contain the insecticide sulfoxaflor. ANSES’s authorisation of the products angered environmental protection groups, which say they are part of the neonicotinoid family of substances that are being phased out in France because of concern they could be a factor in declining bee populations. ANSES argued that while sulfoxaflor functioned in a similar way to neonicotinoids, it remains present in soils and plants for a much shorter time. Friday’s ruling suspends the use of the products in France pending a court hearing to consider detailed arguments from the parties.  Dow AgroSciences SAS, a French subsidiary of the U.S. group, said it planned to appeal the ruling before France’s top administrative court. “We find this ruling extremely surprising,” Benoit Dattin, communications manager at Dow AgroSciences, said. “Our products have a very favourable toxicological profile. The problem is that certain associations have put our products in the same basket as neonicotinoids.” ANSES said in a statement that it had noted the ruling and would continue to examine new evidence, as requested by the government. Environmental group Generations Futures, which took the case to court, welcomed Friday’s ruling and called for an end to all neonicotinoid products. Pesticides have come under the spotlight in a divisive EU debate over whether to renew the licence for glyphosate, a widely used weedkiller made popular by Monsanto’s Roundup brand. The EU’s health regulator approved sulfoxaflor in 2015.  ANSES authorised sulfoxaflor for use on straw cereals like wheat as well as fruit and vegetable crops, but prohibited it for crops that attract pollinating insects and for all crops during flowering periods, noting potential toxic effects for bees. The court in Nice said it was unclear whether restrictions set out by ANSES on the use of sulfoxaflor would be followed.  Dow Chemical, which in September completed a merger with U.S. peer DuPont to become DowDuPont, said sulfoxaflor is used in more than 40 countries.

20,DWDP,UPDATE 6-ADM pursues big ag merger with grain trader Bunge-source,"CHICAGO/CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Top U.S. grain merchant Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) has proposed a takeover of Bunge Ltd (BG.N), according to a person familiar with the approach, which could set up a bidding war with Swiss-based rival Glencore Plc (GLEN.L). Large grain traders that make money by buying, selling, storing and shipping crops have struggled in recent years with global oversupplies. Thin margins have squeezed core commodity trading operations, including those of ADM, Bunge, Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] and Louis Dreyfus Co [AKIRAU.UL], which together are known as the “ABCDs” and dominate the industry. Consolidation is seen as one remedy. Glencore last year sought a tie-up with Bunge in what was viewed as a start of a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the industry. Bunge, which rebuffed an acquisition offer from Glencore last year, might not follow up on ADM’s proposal, the source said, requesting anonymity because the approach is confidential. A standstill agreement prevents Glencore from making a new offer until next month, and Bunge is keeping its options open for now, the source added. White Plains, New York-based Bunge operates in more than 40 countries and is Brazil’s largest exporter of agricultural products, while Chicago-based ADM says it has customers in 160 countries. Bunge, which has a market capitalization of $9.79 billion, closed up 11.4 percent at $77.56 on Friday. ADM has a market cap of $22.64 billion. ADM said it does not comment on “rumors or speculation,” while Bunge did not respond to requests for comment. Glencore was not immediately available for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported on ADM’s interest in Bunge. Grain companies in recent years have expanded into higher-margin sectors, such as food ingredients and aquaculture, to offset weak results and wild swings in their traditional business of handling crops. In 2014, ADM bought natural ingredient company Wild Flavors for about $3 billion in its biggest deal ever. The company has also expanded into handling healthy ingredients such as fruits, nuts and “ancient grains.” “News of the ADM bid is a bit surprising given that ADM had been indicating the company’s strategic direction was more towards value-added rather the traditional commodities,” said Stephens Inc analyst Farha Aslam.  ADM is the most U.S.-focused of the major grain companies and a takeover would help it grow in South America, where Bunge is a major agricultural force. ADM, which dates back to 1902, has tried to expand its international operations, in part to take advantage of growing demand from China. In 2013, Australia rejected its attempted $2.55 billion takeover of Sydney-based grain handler GrainCorp Ltd (GNC.AX) on concerns it could reduce competition. Bunge was founded in Amsterdam 200 years ago. It moved its headquarters to South America as its operations grew in the region and relocated to New York ahead of an initial public offering in 2001. Aslam estimated that fair value for Bunge in a takeover would be $90 to $95 per share, but Morningstar said the price could exceed $100.  Any tie-up would probably face stiff scrutiny from regulators and opposition from farmers who fear handing more market control to ADM could hurt wheat, corn and soybean prices. The biggest overlap between ADM and Bunge in the United States is in grain origination and oilseeds processing, Aslam said. The companies would probably need to divest facilities in North America and also possibly in Europe, she added. Aslam raised the possibility that ADM and Glencore could partner in a bid for Bunge to split up its operations. “ADM would take the more value-added downstream businesses, and Glencore would own the more ag commodity businesses,” she said. An ADM-Bunge merger would also face opposition from farmer groups in key agricultural markets, including the United States, European Union, China, India and Brazil, said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. The companies’ relatively late move into the big-agriculture merger game, behind DowDuPont (DWDP.N), Nutrien Ltd (NTR.TO) and others, would make gaining regulators’ approval even tougher, Gordon said. “When you’re the first one, there’s still more competition,” he said. “Once they’ve let a few through, they may have second thoughts.”  Grain farmers need five or six active buyers to get fair prices for their goods, but there are already only a handful, said Peter Carstensen, who teaches law at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.  “This is the kind of transaction that will screw farmers,” he said.  Illinois farmer Dan Henebry, who delivers corn and soybeans to ADM’s North American headquarters in Decatur, Illinois, said he was worried a takeover of Bunge could lead grain handlers to pay farmers less for their crops. “We’ve had so many mergers,” Henebry said. “Less competition is not good.” ",1202018,http://www.reuters.com/article/bunge-ma-archer-daniels/update-6-adm-pursues-big-ag-merger-with-grain-trader-bunge-source-idUSL1N1PF02S

The company has also expanded into handling healthy ingredients such as fruits, nuts and “ancient grains.” “News of the ADM bid is a bit surprising given that ADM had been indicating the company’s strategic direction was more towards value-added rather the traditional commodities,” said Farha Aslam, analyst for Stephens Inc. Any tie-up would likely face stiff scrutiny from regulators and opposition from farmers who fear handing more market control to ADM could hurt prices paid for wheat, corn and soybeans. The biggest overlap between ADM and Bunge in the United States is in grain origination and oilseeds processing, Aslam said. The companies would probably need to divest facilities in North America and also possibly in Europe, she said. Aslam also said it was possible ADM and Glencore could partner in a bid for Bunge to split up its operations. “ADM would take the more value-added downstream businesses and Glencore would own the more ag commodity businesses,” she said. Analysts at Morningstar said Bunge could go for about $90 to more than $100 per share. Aslam estimated that fair value for Bunge in a takeover would be $90 to $95 per share. A grain trading source said there is so much overlap of oilseed crushing assets between the two companies that the deal looks defensive – a way to keep Glencore from acquiring Bunge. Still, it would shore up ADM’s assets in South America, the trader said. Bunge rebuffed Glencore last year, and the two struck an agreement that temporarily prevents Glencore from making a hostile bid, according to news media reports. An ADM-Bunge merger would also face opposition from farmer groups in key agricultural markets, including the United States, European Union, China, India and Brazil, said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. The companies’ relative tardiness in joining the big-agriculture merger game - following on the heels of DowDuPont , Nutrien Ltd and others – would make gaining regulatory approval even tougher, Gordon said. “When you’re the first one, there’s still more competition. Once they’ve let a few through, they may have second thoughts,” Gordon said. Illinois farmer Dan Henebry, who delivers corn and soybeans to ADM’s North American headquarters in Decatur, Illinois, said he was worried a takeover of Bunge could lead to grain handlers paying farmers less for their crops. “We’ve had so many mergers,” Henebry said. “Less competition is not good.” Rodney Weinzierl, executive director of the Illinois Corn Growers Association, said they would watch the deal closely even though Illinois farmers have a fairly diversified set of buyers for their corn, ranging from ADM and Bunge to cattle ranchers. “Obviously when a couple of our customers talk about being one customer, you lose competition,” he said.

22,DWDP,RPT-INSIGHT-Protein plight: Brazil steals U.S. soybean share in China,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Karl Plume CHICAGO, Jan 25 (Reuters) - U.S. soybean growers are losing market share in the all-important China market because the race to grow higher-yielding crops has robbed their most prized nutrient: protein. Declining protein levels make soybeans less valuable to the $400 billion industry that produces feed for cattle, pigs, chickens and fish. And the problem is a key factor driving soybean buyers from the U.S. to Brazil, where warmer weather helps offset the impact of higher crop yields on protein levels. A decade ago, the United States supplied 38 percent of soybeans to China, the world’s top importer, compared to 34 percent from Brazil. Now, Brazil supplies 57 percent of Chinese imports compared to 31 from the United States, according to China’s General Administration of Customs. Soybeans are by far the most valuable U.S. agricultural export, with $22.8 billion in shipments in 2016. Declining protein levels and market share pose another vexing problem for soy farmers already reeling from a global grains glut and years of depressed prices. The U.S. soybean industry also faces rising competition from a growing number of synthetic and organic alternative feeds that provide more protein for less money. These are troubling trends for the $41 billion U.S. soybean sector, but the industry’s response has yet to take on much urgency. That’s because the erosion of protein levels has come over many years, and many industry players still have short-term economic incentives to prioritize higher yields over higher protein. (For graphic on soybean yield, protein content and market share, see: tmsnrt.rs/2CXgKQE) Protein levels have fallen as biotechnology and other breeding advances have pushed yield per acre to record highs, which dilutes protein content. But U.S. farmers can still make more money producing higher volumes of lower-protein crops because they only get an additional 3 to 5 cents a bushel for higher-protein beans. Over the long term, however, falling protein levels could have dire consequences for the U.S. industry as a whole - especially in China, which buys two-thirds of all soybeans traded in the world market to feed its vast livestock operations. “China needs soybeans, and we’re at risk of becoming a residual supplier if we don’t work on protein improvements,” said North Dakota farmer Jared Hagert, a director and past chairman of the United Soybean Board (USB), an industry association. The USB and other industry advocates are starting to take the protein problem seriously. The industry group will spend $5.6 million in fiscal year 2018 on research and other efforts to boost protein, up from $3.7 million last year. They face a tough task. Like many farmers, the agribusiness giants that develop seed technology, such as Monsanto Co and DowDuPont Inc, have little incentive to focus on raising protein levels. Seed developers have had great success boosting yields through traditional breeding methods and genetic engineering to make crops use less water, tolerate weed killers and grow better in colder or drier climates. But they have yet to crack the genetic code that would raise protein content without hurting yield, seed breeders said. At DowDuPont, scientists have identified some promising leads in boosting protein without hurting crop yields, said Steve Schnebly, senior research manager with the agriculture division of DowDuPont. But any commercially viable solution could be two decades away, he said, and isn’t a company priority. “Our major objective to our farmer customers is maximum yield,” Schnebly said. Monsanto, the world’s largest seed producer, currently has no genetic research projects focusing on elevating protein, spokeswoman Christi Dixon said in a written statement. “Market potential and demand doesn’t warrant the R&D; investment,” she said. The protein decline coincides with a rise of cheaper and more abundant alternative feeds available to livestock and poultry producers. They include distillers grains, a byproduct of the ethanol production process, and synthetic amino acids that are mixed with corn to mimic soymeal. Jeff Knott, a swine nutrition consultant and owner of Minnesota-based Ideal Animal Nutrition, creates recipes with such alternatives for hog feed used by producers in several Midwest states. “Compared to 20 years ago, we’re probably feeding 70 percent less soybean meal than we used to,” he said. “And it’s all economically driven.” Brazilian soybean producers use the same genetically modified seeds as their U.S. counterparts, and have also seen a reduction in protein content. But Brazilian growers retain an crucial edge in protein thanks to warmer weather and longer days. The nation’s soybeans contain 37 percent protein on average, according to data from Embrapa, the government’s agriculture research agency. That compares to 34.1 percent for U.S. crops in 2017 - a record low, according to the U.S. Soybean Export Council. The protein shortfall in this season’s crop has prompted U.S. processors such as Bunge Ltd to cut the amount of protein they can guarantee in soymeal they sell. Brazil’s three-percentage-point protein advantage is plenty enough to sway many buyers, especially when combined with the nation’s recent efforts to expand production and reduce shipping delays. Since overtaking the United States as the world’s top soybean exporter in 2013, Brazil has boosted production by about 40 percent. Expanded port capacity in northern Brazil and lower freight costs have widened the country’s advantage in China, said a Brazilian trader with a large exporting company. “Brazil’s soybeans on average have less impurities and higher protein content,” said the trader, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. “Some destinations will pay a premium for that.” Protein is paramount for Chinese importers, two managers at soy crushing plants and one soy meal buyer at a pig producer told Reuters in interviews. “Feed producers mainly consider the cost of the soy meal - the price, and the amount of protein it contains,” said a swine feed buyer who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak. “With more supplies from Brazil ... we don’t necessarily need to buy beans from the U.S.” The United Soybean Board has launched a pilot project at a small number of processors and grain elevators - facilities that store and load grain for shipping - to record and analyze the protein content of soybeans delivered by local farmers. The effort aims to provide highly localized data in the hope that farmers will select seed varieties that produce higher-protein crops and that soybean buyers will pay them a premium. Other USB efforts include financing genetics research to boost protein, including studies by researchers at the University of Illinois and by scientists at DuPont Pioneer. “We’ve got to be cognizant as to what kind of product we are providing the end user,” said Hagert, the USB director. Another study - conducted by the University of Wisconsin and paid for by the Illinois Soybean Association and the U.S. Soybean Export Council - suggests that farmers can better compete with synthetic alternatives by planting beans with a specific amino acid balance. Such soybeans can save hog feeders up to $3 a head and save chicken producers 7 cents a bird, said the study’s lead author, John Osthus. “Right now, there are synthetic amino acid companies that are undermining U.S. market share,” Osthus said. “If we don’t do something about this, we’re missing a huge market opportunity.” ",1252018,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-soybeans-protein/rpt-insight-protein-plight-brazil-steals-u-s-soybean-share-in-china-idUSL2N1PK04A

Shares of the company, formed by the merger of chemical giants Dow Chemical and DuPont, were down 2.5 percent at $73.56 on Thursday. DowDuPont said it expected earnings per share to grow in the mid-to-high teens percentage range, implying earnings of $3.90-$4.05. That was below the market consensus of $4.22 per share, according to Cowen and Co analysts.  The forecast assumes higher interest expenses related to some new projects, Chief Executive Edward Breen said on a call with analysts. The company, however, expects to see strong growth trends in 2018. “In developed economies in particular, such as the United States, Germany, France, Canada and the U.K., we continue to see strong leading indicators of broad-based growth,” Executive Chairman Andrew Liveris said in the results statement. The chemicals giant said it raised prices by about 5 percent across markets in the fourth quarter, while volumes - a proxy for demand - rose 6 percent. Net sales in the quarter were $20.1 billion versus comparable net sales - which the company terms “pro forma” sales - of $17.7 billion a year earlier. The company also said it was pushing ahead with its plans to split into three separate units, starting with the Materials Science business by the end of the first quarter of 2019. Agriculture and Specialty Products are expected to follow by June 1, 2019. Currently trading at a market value of about $177 billion, Dow and DuPont completed the $130 billion merger in September.

28,DWDP,DowDuPont upbeat on growth as sales rise 14 percent,"Feb 1 (Reuters) - U.S. chemicals producer DowDuPont reported a 14 percent rise in net sales for the fourth quarter as a strong global economy led to robust demand and higher prices for its products. The newly-combined company, formed by the merger of chemical giants Dow Chemical and DuPont four months ago, said its net sales came in at $20.1 billion versus comparable net sales - which the company terms “proforma” sales - of $17.7 billion a year earlier. The chemicals giant saw prices rise by about 5 percent across markets, while volumes - a proxy for demand - rose 6 percent. “In developed economies in particular, such as the United States, Germany, France, Canada and the U.K., we continue to see strong leading indicators of broad-based growth,” executive chairman Andrew Liveris said in the results statement. “Furthermore, early signs from the business community point to U.S. tax reform as a catalyst for further domestic capital investments.” Currently trading at a market value of about $176.9 billion, Dow and DuPont completed the $130 billion mega merger in September. That created the world’s largest chemical maker, until the company goes through with a plan to split into three companies - expected within about 14 to 16 months. The merger was welcomed by investors as a way to streamline the companies’ sprawling operations by combining overlapping businesses. DowDuPont said on Thursday it was now planning to save $3.3 billion in costs on the back of the merger -  slightly more than the $3 billion it expected to save earlier. For the reported quarter DowDuPont saw a $1.1 billion benefit from lower U.S corporate taxes, but still posted a net loss of $1.2 billion from continuing operations - substantially the result of merger-related costs. Adjusted for those and other one time effects, the company earned 83 cents on a share.

Schulman Inc for $1.24 billion, doubling the size of its plastics business and moving into the packaging, electronics and building markets. LyondellBasell’s plastics business currently gets about 90 percent of its revenue from the automotive industry and the all-cash deal will lower that proportion to just over 50 percent, the company said. The rest of the revenue will come from plastic compounds – blending molten plastic with additives – used to make products such as headphones, mobile chargers, PVC pipes, water bottles and food containers among others. The plastics compounding industry has grown faster-than-expected over the past decade, with improving margins, while not requiring much capital, analysts and company executives said. Shares of A. Schulman surged 11 percent to $42.93 in morning trading, compared with the offer price of $42 per share. LyondellBasell’s shares fell 2 percent to $109.65. The deal will also marginally boost LyondellBasell’s exposure to the agricultural sector, which has been the focus of recent mega-deals among chemicals makers. Dow Chemical and DuPont completed their $130 billion merger last year to form DowDuPont, while ChemChina bought Swiss seeds group Syngenta for $43 billion. A combined LyondellBasell-A. Schulman had $4.6 billion in revenue and EBITDA margins of 9.5 percent over the last 12 months, with a majority of revenue coming from A. Schulman and the bigger margin boost from LyondellBasell, the companies said. The combined company is expected to hit $150 million in run-rate cost savings within two years. The deal will add to earnings within the first full year after closing, expected in the second half of 2018, LyondellBasell said. A. Schulman shareholders will also get one contingent value right per share that will allow them to get certain net proceeds recovered, if any, from ongoing litigation and government probes related to Schulman’s Citadel and Lucent acquisitions. Including A. Schulman’s existing debt, the deal is valued at $2.25 billion, the companies said. J.P. Morgan and Dyal Co are LyondellBasell’s financial advisers and Citigroup is advising A. Schulman. Shearman & Sterling LLP is LyondellBasell’s legal counsel, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is advising A. Schulman.

38,DWDP,"DowDuPont's Andrew Liveris steps down, names CEO for new Dow","(Reuters) - DowDuPont Inc chief Andrew Liveris will step down on April 1, making good on an earlier promise to retire as the company named existing managers to head its materials science unit when it is spun off as Dow next year. Liveris, a 40-year industry veteran, is exiting after piloting the merger of the United States’ two largest chemical producers - Dupont and Dow - in a $130 billion deal last year. That paved the way for the new firm to be divided into three separate businesses.  The materials science unit, which accounts for most legacy Dow businesses and will retain the Dow brand, produces chemicals that go into making everything from cosmetics to packaging material to brake fluids.  It will be headed by the division’s current chief operating officer Jim Fitterling and his Chief Financial Officer Howard Ungerleider, both Dow veterans who have worked extensively on the merger.  The company has not announced who will lead the two other units, a specialty plastics and polymers business which will carry the DuPont name, and agriculture-focussed Corteva Agriscience. “The plans announced today (are) the result of many years of working on a succession pipeline,” Liveris told Reuters, adding that he made up his mind to leave during the Christmas holidays. “Jim and Howard have been valued members of Dow’s and my most senior leadership team and have each played a pivotal role in developing and executing Dow’s market-driven strategy.” 63-year-old Liveris spent more than forty years at Dow Chemical -  more than a decade of those as CEO - before taking over as executive chairman at the joint company. He will stay on as director until July 1, after which he will retire, in line with an initial announcement two years ago. Liveris did not say what he plans to do after retirement but said it could be something in the “intersection of business and policy.” He was named head of President Trump’s Manufacturing Council before its dissolution last year. Before that, Liveris had served as co-chair of President Obama’s Advanced Manufacturing Partnership steering committee.

44,DWDP,CORRECTED-UPDATE 3-LyondellBasell doubles plastics business with $2.25 bln Schulman deal (Feb. 15)," (This version of the Feb 15 story corrects deal value to $2.25 billion from $2.24 billion) By Ahmed Farhatha (Reuters) - Chemicals maker LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB.N) said it will buy smaller rival A. Schulman Inc (SHLM.O) for $2.25 billion, doubling the size of its business that supplies plastic compounds to the packaging, electronics and building markets. LyondellBasell’s plastic compounding business - blending molten plastic with additives - now largely caters to the automobile parts market. “What we like about this transaction is that it diversifies our compounding business and gives us access to the full range of markets rather than just automotive where we had a very strong position,” LyondellBasell’s Chief Executive Bhavesh Patel said on a call with analysts. Auto-end markets currently account for about 90 percent of LyondellBasell’s plastic compounding revenue and that will drop to just over 50 percent after the deal closes. The deal, worth $2.25 billion including debt, is expected to close in the second half of 2018, the companies said. Shares of A. Schulman were up 10.3 percent at $42.65 in afternoon trading, above the offer price of $42. LyondellBasell’s shares dipped 1.7 percent at $110.42 The deal will also marginally boost LyondellBasell’s exposure to the agricultural sector, which has been the focus of mega-deals among chemicals makers. Dow Chemical and DuPont completed their $130 billion merger last year to form DowDuPont (DWDP.N), while ChemChina [CNCC.UL] bought Swiss seeds group Syngenta SYNN.S for $43 billion. A combined LyondellBasell-A. Schulman had $4.6 billion in revenue and EBITDA margins of 9.5 percent over the last 12 months, the companies said. The combined company is expected to hit $150 million in run-rate cost savings in two years. After closing, the deal will add to earnings within the first full year, the companies said. A. Schulman shareholders will also get one contingent value right per share that will give them net proceeds, if any, from the ongoing litigation and government probes related to Schulman’s Citadel and Lucent acquisitions. J.P. Morgan and Dyal Co are LyondellBasell’s financial advisers and Citigroup is A. Schulman’s adviser. Shearman & Sterling LLP is LyondellBasell’s legal counsel, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is advising A. Schulman.

47,DWDP,"UPDATE 2-Devon Energy raises 2018 production outlook, shares climb","(Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producer Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) raised its annual production forecast on Tuesday, saying it expected total output to rise 16 percent from last year compared with an earlier forecast of 14 percent. The Oklahoma City-based shale company’s production for the first quarter was near the high end of its outlook after disappointing fourth-quarter results. Its shares jumped more than 3 percent to $37.45 in late trading. Devon produced 544,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day in the quarter ended March 31, compared with 563,000 boepd in the same period a year earlier. Results were near the high end of a February projection of between 530,000 and 554,000 boepd.      Net loss attributable to shareholders was $197 million, or 38 cents per share, compared with a profit of $303 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. The loss reflected a $312 million charge to earnings to retire debt during the period. Excluding the charge, Devon earned 20 cents per share, in line with analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue rose to $3.81 billion from $3.55 billion in the same period a year ago.  The company also said it reached an agreement with DowDupont (DWDP.N) in which the chemicals producer will pay $75 million over five years for a half interest in 116 undrilled locations in the Barnett shale region of Texas. Devon will drill and operate up to 24 wells per year as part of agreement. Devon forecast production for the current quarter of between 524,000 and 549,000 boepd and estimated full year output of between 536,000 and 560,000 boepd.
