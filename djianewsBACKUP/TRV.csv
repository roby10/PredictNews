1,TRV,Tornadoes and interest rates to hit insurers' results,"NEW YORK/BANGALORE (Reuters) - It’s a rough time to be an insurer, and investors looking at quarterly earnings will be focusing mostly on a single question: How long will the pain last.  The second quarter is likely to go down as one of the worst for the U.S. insurance industry in years, mostly for property insurers, which will report billions of dollars in catastrophe losses due to powerful tornadoes that struck in April and May.  Life insurers fared somewhat better from a performance standpoint, though persistently low interest rates continue to batter their shares and create medium-term uncertainty.  Among the winners in the industry: insurance brokers that could benefit from property insurers’ difficulties.  Property insurers have already disclosed more than $6 billion in losses from the tornadoes that ravaged parts of the country in April and May, so losses will not be a surprise.  Dow industrials component Travelers Companies (TRV.N) has said it expects an operating loss, and others would not surprise if they reported the same. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S expect operating losses of 64 cents a share for Travelers and $1.53 for Allstate.  “Major losses from tornadoes, other bad weather and earthquakes have eliminated earnings for many. Meanwhile, top-lines remain weak and investment yields low. In addition, the economy is hardly robust,” KBW analysts said in a July 12 research note.  Share buybacks are off the table after years of multibillion-dollar programs, but KBW said share weakness was an opportunity for investors to buy companies like ACE ACE.N and Chubb (CB.N).  To the extent there is any good news in the quarter, some say, it may come from the Bermudan reinsurers. Langen McAlenney insurance analysts, in a July 11 note, said investors may be pleasantly surprised by premiums in Bermuda, as pricing has started to firm following years of declines.  On the life insurance side of the industry, all signs suggest business has remained somewhat steady.  The problem for life insurers, as it has been of late, is persistently low interest rates. As long-term investments mature, the insurers have to put that capital in new long-term instruments at much lower rates. That could create problems meeting obligations in future years and force insurers to tap their surplus.  Even as low rates weigh on insurance product and annuity sales, Barclays Capital forecast double-digit growth in operating earnings per share on the effect of share buybacks and growth from acquisitions. The country’s two largest life insurers, MetLife (MET.N) and Prudential (PRU.N), are both digesting substantial acquisitions from AIG (AIG.N).  “The life insurance sector could be revalued upward as these companies generate increasingly consistent results,” Barclays said in a note, given the contributions they gain from their expansion of late. Analysts on average expect earnings of $1.13 per share from MetLife and $1.55 for Prudential.  Given the series of catastrophes and rise in business volumes, most brokerages are optimistic about reinsurance brokers like Aon (AON.N), Willis WSH.N and Marsh & McLennan (MMC.N), as they stand to benefit from rising premiums.  Insurance brokers with international exposure like Arthur J Gallagher (AJG.N), Aon and Marsh should also benefit from a weak U.S. dollar, Raymond James analyst Gregory Peters said in a note.  For title insurers, analysts expect home sales to remain sluggish with the depressed real estate markets. The industry has been unable to generate meaningful earnings or premium growth in the last couple of years as business volumes continue to remain low.  “As far as industry growth is concerned I’m not expecting any surprises in the second-quarter. Things are pretty much going to remain the same,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Dwelle said.

3,TRV,Competition pushing rates down for cyberinsurance,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rates for cybersecurity insurance edged lower in the last few months despite surging demand, as heavy competition brewed among insurers rushing into the market in search of the next profitable product, insurance brokers Marsh said on Wednesday.  A series of high-profile data breaches at companies including Sony Corp and Citigroup have drawn sudden attention to “cyberinsurance,” which covers everything from the cost of notifying customers their data has been breached to the cost of defending against those customers’ lawsuits.  A number of brokers told Reuters in early June that their phones were ringing off the hook, with some customers seeking coverage limits of up to $200 million for new policies. Such huge limits are noteworthy, since less than 5 percent of all data breaches cost more than $20 million.  Yet despite all that demand, there has also been a marked increase in the number of insurers willing to write such policies. Travelers Companies Inc, one of the largest property and casualty insurers in the world, launched its own program last month, and others like Chubb Corp are increasingly aggressive in the market as well.  “We see a major player come into the space once a quarter, once every other quarter, so capacity continues to exceed demand,” said Bob Parisi, a senior vice president in the financial and professional liability practice at Marsh, a unit of Marsh & McLennan.  “You’ve got $100 million, $200 million in capacity chasing $25 million in risk. It’s the undiscovered country, everyone’s looking for a growth area.”  Amid that competition, Marsh said cyberinsurance rates fell an average of 2 percent in the second quarter. Insurers are giving their customers extra coverage in an attempt to hold the line on rates, but prices are still falling, Marsh said.  Those concessions include raising coverage limits, lowering deductibles, or adopting a more liberal interpretation of what counts as a claim — all of which benefit the customer at the expense of greater risk for the insurer.  As it has been for years, one of the biggest problems is accurate pricing. Customers face huge risks and insurers are still developing standards to figure out who is worth covering and who is uninsurable at any price.  “You’re insuring all the nonsmoking, low-cholesterol iron workers — they do something inherently dangerous but they’re well-trained and they’re all healthy,” Parisi said, by way of an analogy to describe how insurers approach cyber risk.  Of all the categories of coverage that exist, Marsh said the biggest increase in claims during the most recent quarter was for privacy-related claims, such as notifying customers their data had been breached and giving them credit monitoring and identity theft services.  A year of credit monitoring services has been become a standard offering from companies to their customers after a data breach, consumer advocates say.  Even so, new risks continue to emerge all the time. The latest is social media, particularly as financial companies increasingly tie up with social networks, like the American Express deal this week with Facebook.  “No one has any idea what risk social media and social networks are creating yet,” Parisi said.

Its competitor Chubb, on the other hand, easily beat expectations and forecast profits for the year well ahead of Wall Street estimates, as its disaster exposure was much lower in the quarter.   Travelers warned in early June that it would post an operating loss after some of the worst tornadoes in American history leveled towns like Joplin, Missouri. It also said at the time that it would have to slow down its share buyback program. [ID:nN10172421]   The company ended up with after-tax catastrophe losses of $1.09 billion in the quarter, slightly above the high end of its forecast range. The total losses were equal to the kind of hit the company would take from a once-in-100-years hurricane, it said.   Yet despite all the bad news, Travelers said pricing had improved across all of its business lines, a positive sign for a property insurer after years of market weakness.   Travelers said it had paid more for its reinsurance coverage. This was a welcome sign for that sector, which had taken tens of billions of dollars in global losses in 2011.   Shares in Travelers, which were lower much of the day, closed 1.1 percent higher at $57.69.   “We view firmer prices as a catalyst for the shares, but expect them to be volatile today as investors digest the operating loss,” Standard & Poor’s insurance equity analyst Cathy Seifert said in a note.   Travelers, a Dow Jones industrial average component, posted a net loss of $364 million, or 88 cents per share, on Thursday, compared with a year-earlier profit of $670 million, or $1.35 per share.   Excluding investment gains and losses, the company’s operating loss was 91 cents per share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, on average, expected a loss of 64 cents.   It was the fourth quarter in a row that Travelers’ per-share results differed from the analysts’ average estimate by at least 20 cents.   The company said underwriting margins in its business and financial segments in the second half of 2011 and the early part of 2012 should be consistent with the first half of this year. Underwriting margins should improve in its auto and home business, it said, on higher prices for policy renewals.   Travelers competitor Chubb Corp (CB.N) reported a smaller net profit on Thursday afternoon, but was still well ahead of Wall Street estimates as business expanded and pricing improved.   Chubb reported net income of $419 million, or $1.42 per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $518 million, or $1.59 per share. Operating income fell to $1.27 per share, compared with the $1.01 per share analysts expected.   Chubb’s pretax catastrophe losses totaled $329 million during the quarter.   The company raised its full-year operating earnings outlook to a range of $5.55 to $5.85 per share, from a range of $5.35 to $5.75 per share previously. Analysts expected earnings of $5.28 per share for the year, on average.   Chubb shares rose 2.3 percent to $64 in after-hours trading.

8,TRV,Analysis: New asbestos charges point to reserve woes,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Asbestos-related diseases have been falling for a decade, but warnings from a pair of U.S. insurance giants about new claims raise questions about the industry’s ability to put the scourge behind it.  While medical evidence suggests fewer new cases of asbestosis and the lung cancer mesothelioma, insurers say they are getting sued more frequently and aggressively by people with claims against “peripheral insureds,” such as contractors that worked on projects where asbestos was used.  As some of these lawsuits succeed in courts across the country, it fuels new suits by aggressive plaintiffs’ lawyers and compounds the problem for insurers trying to understand their exposure.  The disconnect between a waning disease and flourishing claims also exposes a flaw endemic to insurers. When they set aside reserves for indistinct risks, they are making guesses — even if educated ones — on how long a particular risk will endure and what it will cost them to be done with it.  No law says any particular company’s guess has to match anyone else’s, but investors raise alarms about companies where reserves are not in line with peers.  That’s why Hartford Financial’s announcement this month of a $290 million pretax earnings hit from increasing reserves for asbestos cases fostered concerns beyond the insurer’s citation of rising claims for mesothelioma.  “Although these items are one-time events, the result raises questions about ... reserve adequacy,” Barclays Capital analyst Jay Gelb said in a note to investors. He was referring to both the asbestos charge and Hartford’s sharp rise in second-quarter catastrophe losses.  American International Group Inc similarly riled investors in early February with a $4.1 billion addition to its reserves, including more than $1 billion related to its asbestos exposure.  Fitch Ratings responded by cutting the credit rating on AIG’s domestic property unit insurance units, calling the charges “a significant outlier” compared to competitors and the whole property insurance market.  According to insurance ratings agency AM Best, the Hartford had the fourth-highest level of asbestos and environmental reserves of all large property insurers at the end of 2009 while AIG ranked seventh. They also ranked in the top seven in terms of average annual asbestos losses in 2005-2009.  AIG and The Hartford are in particularly sensitive positions since they were two of the three insurers who took government bailouts during the financial crisis. Their reserve accounting has not been questioned by any of their regulators.  For decades asbestos was a favorite material in building products, naval applications and other industrial settings because of its fire-retardant properties. Over time, though, exposure to its microscopic fibers causes health problems.  More recently, many of the rescue workers at the Ground Zero site in New York after the 9/11 attacks were exposed to high concentrations of asbestos - in some cases, reports have said, nearly a million times the normal background level.  To be sure, some of the new claims stem from plaintiffs’ lawyers becoming more effective at suing people who are only peripherally connected to asbestos victims. Late-night cable television is flooded with ads from asbestos lawyers, and “mesothelioma” is among the most valuable of advertising keywords on Google. Since there is still plenty of asbestos in buildings across the country, it is also possible that new cases are adding to insurers’ burdens.  Best warned in February that the insurance industry is generally underfunded in its asbestos reserves. It cited a growing number of legal claims reflecting a weakening of tort reform in some states and the “ongoing filing of mesothelioma claims for years to come.”  Asbestos claims have been a bane of insurers for at least a decade. They nearly brought down the Lloyd’s of London market in the 1990s and have cost some of the industry’s largest players billions of dollars. Insurers like MetLife were accused for decades of helping to conceal the deadly side effects of the fire retardant.  In recent years, insurance investors have been celebrating the steady decline of asbestos-related claims and reserves. According to the Insurance Information Institute, reserves grew every year from 2001 to 2005, then shrank every year since through 2009.  The trend appeared to be tracking the medical evidence. New cases of malignant mesothelioma, a lung cancer caused only by asbestos exposure that one oncologist called a “tremendously lousy disease,” declined at an annual rate of 1.8 percent from 1999 to 2008, according to the American Cancer Society.  “I am surprised myself to hear insurers are (seeing) more claims, because we think with the reduction of asbestos years back we’re starting to see a reduction in incidence of the disease,” said Kevin Becker, an oncologist at Maimonides Medical Center in New York.  Annual reports from MetLife, the country’s largest life insurer, show new claims and total outstanding claims dropping at a steady pace from 2003 through 2010, declining around 40 percent over the period.  The sums paid annually by the industry as settlements also have generally been shrinking. A.M. Best’s forecast that the insurance industry may ultimately end up paying $75 billion in asbestos claims over time seems inflated to some regulators.  “I can’t speak for everyone out there but (claims) may be a little less than that,” said Joseph Torti, Rhode Island’s superintendent of insurance and the designated spokesman on asbestos issues for the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.  LONG-TERM CHALLENGE  But deciding to build or draw down reserves remains a crapshoot for insurers.  Mesothelioma has an incredibly long latency period, meaning 30 years or more can pass between exposure to asbestos and the onset of the cancer. That is why companies such as Travelers and Berkshire Hathaway continue to build reserves.  “Trends were kind of favorable, but you still see the companies with exposure kind of trickling up their reserves from time to time,” said Jim Auden, head of the property and casualty insurance unit at Fitch Ratings.  Another concern for insurers are new and expensive therapies being developed to treat mesothelioma.  The upshot? Asbestos claims and payments are not going away, and no one knows when the bend will turn.  “You wish that this would be completed,” Auden said. “These claims are tied to activities in the ‘70s mostly (and) you still can’t get your arms around it.”  ",7282011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-insurance-asbestos/analysis-new-asbestos-charges-point-to-reserve-woes-idUSTRE76R4CW20110728
9,TRV,UPDATE 2-Insurer Hiscox sinks to loss as disaster claims soar," * H1 loss 85.6 mln stg vs 84.6 mln stg loss consensus   * Catastrophe reserves 210 mln stg vs yr-ago 110 mln   * Takes 11 mln stg fine art loss   (Adds chairman comment, analyst reaction, shares)	   By Myles Neligan	   LONDON, Aug 1 - Bermuda-based insurer Hiscox on Monday reported a bigger than expected loss after catastrophe claims nearly doubled as a result of the Japanese earthquake and other disasters.	   Hiscox, whose insurance covers a wide range of items, from oil refineries to fine art and vintage cars, made a pretax loss of 85.6 million pounds ($140.5 million) in the first half of 2011, compared with a profit of 97.2 million pounds a year earlier.	   Analysts had expected a loss of 84.6 million pounds, according to a consensus forecast calculated by the company.	   The deterioration came as Hiscox set aside 210 million pounds to absorb catastrophe claims in the first six months, up from 110 million pounds a year earlier.	   Earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand, floods in Australia and tornadoes in the U.S. caused $265 billion of damage in the first six months of 2011, making it the costliest year for natural disasters on record, according to Munich Re (MUVGn.DE), the world’s No. 1 reinsurer.	   Rival insurers Beazley and Travelers have also reported first-half losses because of big natural disaster claims, and analysts expect others to follow suit.	   Hiscox chairman Robert Hiscox said the company was selling more catastrophe insurance at higher prices in response to the natural disasters, though price increases in the broader market were more muted.	   “The swing has come, and feast does follow famine in our business,” he said in an interview. 	   “Losses may be painful to announce, but they do have a good effect.”	   Hiscox shares were up 1.3 percent by 0810 GMT, while the FTSE 250 share index was up 0.7 percent. The stock has risen 7.6 percent in the year to date, outpacing a 5.6 percent increase in the FTSE non-life insurance index .	   “2011 is pretty much a write-off in terms of financial performance, but the benefits in terms of improving rates will be seen in 2012, and Hiscox is one of the best positioned to take advantage,” analysts at Peel Hunt wrote in a note.	   Hiscox is expected to edge back into the black over the second half, with analysts pencilling in a pretax profit of 11 million pounds for the year as a whole, according to the company’s own poll.	   Hiscox’s first-half loss also reflected a 17 million pound payout to cover the cost of repatriating clients’ employees during the unrest in Libya and Egypt, and a further 11 million pound hit from the damage and theft of valuable paintings in Europe.

10,TRV,UPDATE 1-Marsh: Insurance rate declines have stopped,"   * Turn in property rates follows 18 months of declines   * Rate up 1.1 pct in average renewal so far in Q3   * Hurricane Irene could push rates much higher  (Adds A.M. Best loss figures)   NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Property insurance rates have stopped falling after 18 months of steady declines, as natural disasters begin to give insurers more pricing power, insurance brokerage Marsh said on Tuesday.   So far in the third quarter, the average property insurance renewal has been done at a 1.1 percent rate increase, Marsh said. In the worst of the downturn, renewal rates were averaging declines of more than 5 percent a quarter.   Pricing power has been a problem for the insurance industry in recent years as excess capacity and heavy competition have kept rates falling, in some cases to lows last seen a decade ago or more.   But natural disasters over the last year — including three earthquakes in New Zealand, the March quake and nuclear disaster in Japan, and tornadoes in the United States — appear to have turned the tide.   Insurance ratings agency A.M. Best said on Tuesday that U.S. property and casualty insurers suffered $27 billion in insured losses in the first half of 2011, nearly 50 percent greater than the losses for all of 2010.   The primary catalyst was tornadoes, particularly the record-breaking ones that struck in April and May.   Industry executives and analysts are now closely watching Hurricane Irene, which is expected to make landfall in the United States this weekend. Depending on where it hits, some say it will be damaging enough to drive rates higher across the industry.

11,TRV,Irene losses start to mount as storm aims at NYC,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene is likely to cause more insured losses in the Bahamas than 1999’s devastating Hurricane Floyd, catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide said on Thursday, even as the storm increasingly tracks toward a weekend landfall in the greater New York City area.  Floyd was one of the strongest tropical cyclones on record when it hit the Bahamas more than a decade ago, and it later prompted one of the largest evacuations in U.S. history as well. AIR said Irene’s path through the Bahamas made greater damage than Floyd more likely.  More detailed estimates are expected on Friday, as the storm passes over the islands and begins to take aim at the Eastern United States.  While Irene has a long way to travel, and a great deal of uncertainty still remains, more and more computer models on Thursday suggested the storm would come very close to New York City or perhaps even pass directly over it.  The last hurricane known to have made landfall in the city proper was in 1821, causing a 13 feet storm surge that inundated the entirety of lower Manhattan. City officials said they are considering evacuations.  Beyond New York City and Long Island, the storm looks set to hit large swaths of New England with heavy rains and wind, potentially including Boston.  “If it follows its exact tracking you may not see exact hurricane-force winds in the Manhattan area, it may be more strong tropical storm-type stuff,” said James Aman, senior meteorologist at Earth Networks. “Certainly the south shore of Long Island seems to be the area that’s most under the gun right now. A lot of (Northeast U.S.) areas will see high-end tropical storm conditions here by the end of the weekend.”  Aman said there is a chance, based on the current tracks, that a Category 1 hurricane could make landfall Sunday afternoon right around the area of JFK Airport, one of the country’s most important.  One expert in disaster modeling said it would be hard for New York, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Massachusetts to escape significant damage.  “I would be surprised if New England completely gets by without any damage on this one,” said Peter Dailey, director of atmospheric science for AIR, one of the three companies insurance companies rely on to model their exposure to disasters.  Dailey said storm surge was a particularly important issue for the Northeast, with low-lying areas susceptible to flooding if the hurricane pushes the waters up substantially.  Much will depend, he said, on timing — tides are expected to be especially high on Sunday night, so if the storm hits then, flooding could be exacerbated.  Shares in property insurers were about 3 percent lower on Thursday, a sharper decline than the broader markets, as the storm moved closer. Among those most exposed are AIG, Chubb Allstate and Travelers.

14,TRV,Wall Street posts first weekly gain in more than a month,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street posted its first weekly gain in more than a month as Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke raised hopes for more stimulus for the economy at the U.S. central bank’s September meeting.  Initially stocks fell after Bernanke stopped short of describing detailed plans to strengthen the ailing economy. But the market turned higher, led by technology shares, as investors concluded the Fed was leaving the door open for action even though many traders believe it has limited power to pull the economy out of a rut.  The CBOE Volatility Index or VIX .VIX, Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” retreated after days of uncertainty on what Bernanke would say. The VIX slid 10.2 percent to 35.69, after earlier falling as much as 14 percent to a session low at 34.33.  “He didn’t give the market the green light for QE3. He also didn’t give the market the red light for QE3,” said Kevin Caron, market strategist at Stifel, Nicolaus in Florham Park, New Jersey, referring to a possible third round of quantitative easing.  “By implying that inflation is viewed as not a concern, it leaves the possibility for something down the road,” he said.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI ended up 134.72 points, or 1.21 percent, at 11,284.54. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 17.53 points, or 1.51 percent, at 1,176.80. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 60.22 points, or 2.49 percent, at 2,479.85.  For the week, the Dow rose 4.3 percent, the S&P gained 4.7 percent and the Nasdaq rose 5.9 percent.  Bernanke, speaking in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, said the central bank’s policy panel would meet for two days in September instead of the scheduled one-day meeting to discuss any more stimulus.  While expressing long-term optimism, Bernanke said the Fed found recent developments troubling and saw a low inflation as staying low.  Shares of property insurers were mixed after falling earlier in the week on worries that severe damage from Hurricane Irene would result in substantial claims.  Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) edged up 0.6 percent to $48.29 after earlier hitting a two-year low. Allstate (ALL.N) was up 0.1 percent at $24.45, having also hit a two-year low. Insurers typically fall before severe weather events and rally later.  Chubb Corp (CB.N) gained 1.2 percent to $59.38.  As Irene bore down on North Carolina, tens of thousands of people evacuated and East Coast cities, including New York, braced for a weekend hit from the powerful storm.  NYSE Euronext NYX.N said the New York Stock Exchange plans to open for trading as usual next week, but because of the possibility of flooding, a decision will not be made until Saturday or Sunday.  Technology stocks led the advance, with Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O) among the Dow’s top gainers.  Cisco shares rose 1.6 percent to $15.32, while Microsoft shares added 2.8 percent to $25.25, and Intel Corp advanced 1.8 percent to $19.77.  The S&P information technology index .GSPT shot up 2.3 percent, making it the S&P 500’s best-performing sector.  “It’s a pretty broad market rally right now, but tech has been really hammered in the selloff, so you see that leading the rally,” said Gary Wedbush, head of trading at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles.  Tiffany and Co (TIF.N) rose 9.3 percent to $69.01 after it raised its full-year profit outlook.

19,TRV,Insurers start to total up Irene damage,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Insurance adjusters are already moving into some of the areas hit by Hurricane Irene, which early indications suggest was as bad as people feared but not as devastating as some other storms to hit the Carolinas.  But as the storm moves up the U.S. East Coast, it is presenting a greater flooding risk than some had expected. With the overwhelming majority of flood insurance in the United States written by the government’s National Flood Insurance Program, that storm surge could turn out to be a huge headache for Washington at a time of deficit-cutting pressure.  Catastrophe modelers say Irene caused up to $1.1 billion in insured losses just in the Caribbean, and depending on the storm’s track in New England some have said losses north of $10 billion are possible.  Eqecat, one of those companies, said on Saturday it appears Irene caused less damage in North Carolina and Virginia than 1999’s Hurricane Floyd, which the National Hurricane Center ranks as one of the 15 costliest hurricanes ever.  A spokesman for Allstate Corp, the country’s largest publicly traded home and auto insurer, said the storm has been as bad as the company expected.  “I’ve got to imagine we’re going to see some evidence of property damage, auto damage down along the North Carolina area,” Brett Ludwig said.  While people appear to have prepared as much as they could in coastal areas, Ludwig — who was in the field for legendary hurricanes like Katrina, Rita and Gustav — said there was much less evidence inland that people had made preparations such as boarding up windows to harden property for the storm.  An agent for State Farm, the country’s largest property insurer, said he was surprised at the intensity of the wind and the duration of the storm, but he added that Irene so far seemed to have done less damage than 1996’s Hurricane Fran or 1999’s Floyd.  “There’s a lot of trees down, a lot of power outages, a lot of shingles missing but I didn’t see any huge structural damage as we saw in Fran,” said David Hull, whose Jacksonville, North Carolina home had already been without power for 14 hours. He said utility company crews were already out in his neighborhood assessing damage.  While Irene’s intensity was diminishing, meteorologists say its size and speed make up for any decrease in the winds. Forecasters for the ABC affiliate in New York said on Saturday the storm surge from Irene will be higher than expected, perhaps 5 to 8 feet in the city itself.  With an unusually high tide expected on Sunday, the surge could be made that much worse.  New York is one of the most heavily insured states by the National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP. As of June 30, according to government statistics, the program had $8.61 billion of insurance in force on nearly 38,000 policies just in New York City.  Cities across Long Island are also heavily insured, with at least six towns with more than $1 billion in insurance policies in force.  By way of comparison, the NFIP’s administrator, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, paid out more than $11 billion in claims after Hurricane Katrina.

21,TRV,Early estimates suggest Irene losses tame,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene caused between $200 million and $400 million in insured losses in the Carolinas, catastrophe modeling company EQECAT said on Sunday, suggesting the storm may have been far less severe than the insurance industry feared.  The bigger question, though, is how much coverage people have for the severe flooding that struck New York and New Jersey, and whether the federal government’s flood program can handle all of the claims.  EQECAT said the bulk of the losses it has seen so far come particularly from storm surge and flooding.  Combined with its estimate of $300 million to $600 million in insured losses from a direct hit on parts of the Caribbean, EQECAT now puts Irene’s total damage so far in a range of $500 million to $1 billion.  That is far less than its competitor, AIR Worldwide, which estimated Irene’s damages in the Caribbean at $1.1 billion.  It is not unusual for catastrophe modeling companies, whose software is used by insurers to model their exposure to natural disasters, to differ widely in their initial loss estimates.  The figures tend to be revised as the days go by and the companies send more teams to the disaster sites to survey losses first-hand.  Still, the early figures compare with some projections by meteorologists and statisticians that Irene could be a $10 billion or more event. Much will depend on how much damage the storm did in the greater New York area.  Loss estimates on the rest of the U.S. East Coast are expected on Monday.  Nationwide Mutual, one of the country’s largest property insurers, said it received 6,000 claims calls on Sunday, which is twice what it would usually expect on the Sunday after a major storm.  A spokeswoman for the company said that presents a mystery that could take days to clarify.  They can not tell yet whether they are getting an unusually high volume of claims, which would imply a lot of storm damage, or whether more people are calling than usual because they have already gotten home after the storm, which would imply it was somewhat mild.  “Generally what we’re seeing as you move east is a lot of trees on houses, widespread power outages and as you get closer and closer to the coast, we’ve got coastal flooding, the power outages are even more widespread,” said Brian Maness, a claims manager for the company in North Carolina.  In New Jersey, the state is expecting damage in “the billions of dollars, if not in the tens of billions of dollars,” Gov. Chris Christie told NBC’s “Meet the Press.”  By all accounts, in cities like Jersey City, Montclair, Nutley and Hoboken, that damage will come in large part from flooding that put in some cases multiple feet of water into homes.  New Jersey is the fourth-most insured state by the National Flood Insurance Program, which writes almost all of the flood insurance in the United States.  The state has $51.88 billion of insurance in force from the NFIP, and Jersey City and Hoboken are two of the most insured cities in the state. On the other hand, for example, Montclair and Nutley are two of the least.  Congress is working on a reform package for the NFIP, which has been surviving on a series of one-year extensions amid a debate about the cost of the program and its role in keeping the private sector largely out of the flood insurance business.

24,TRV,Irene losses less than once feared,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene caused $3 billion to $6 billion in insured losses, catastrophe modeling company AIR Worldwide said on Monday, affirming the insurance industry’s suspicion the impact was not as bad as feared.  In the days leading up to Irene, some had expected a $10 billion hit, though as Irene actually made land it appeared the storm was not doing the damage it was expected to do. AIR, whose estimate covers U.S. onshore properties, develops software that insurers use to model exposure to disasters.  Insurance shares rallied sharply on Monday, far outpacing the broader market, on relief the payouts would not be as bad as they could have been.  Even so, some analysts said the storm may have been something of a worst-case scenario for large U.S. property insurers such as Allstate Corp and Travelers Companies Inc, enough to wipe out some or all of their third-quarter earnings, but not enough to cause an industrywide increase in prices after years of weakness.  Allstate shares rose 8.5 percent and Travelers rose 5.1 percent, in line with European insurers, which rose on relief the damage from Irene was not as bad as feared. Twenty of the 22 companies in the S&P insurance index outperformed the broader market.  Millions of people throughout the Northeastern United States were still flooded and without electricity on Monday, particularly in rural Vermont and suburban New Jersey. Totaling those losses is expected to take time, as is the process of figuring out how many of the affected had government-backed flood insurance.  By some accounts, the insured losses in the Carolinas were as little as $200 million after the storm made landfall there Saturday.  Before the hurricane, some feared Irene could be a $10 billion event or more. Analysts and insurance executives suggested something above $15 billion could bring a structural change to the insurance market, pushing prices higher around the world after three years of weakness.  It seemed unlikely Irene would hit that mark, with trade groups such as the Insurance Information Institute and the Property and Casualty Insurers of America saying estimates below $5 billion sounded right.  “The impact to insurers from Irene is probably not large enough to cause increased pricing and will not result in a broad (property and casualty) cycle turn because we estimate there is still least $100 billion of excess U.S. P&C industry capital,” Barclays Capital said in a note on Monday.  Between the Caribbean and the Carolinas, AIR competitor Eqecat has estimated losses of no more than $1 billion. AIR Worldwide has previously forecast losses of $1.1 billion just for the Caribbean. The third key player in catastrophe modeling for the insurance industry, RMS, has not weighed in with a figure.  On Monday, RMS did say the damage so far is much more likely to be from flood and storm surge than wind, which would get the insurance industry off the hook for most of the losses and push the payout burden onto the National Flood Insurance Program.  The shares of the world’s top three reinsurers — Munich Re, Swiss Re and Hannover Re — rose 4 to 6 percent as analysts said they did not expect that any losses would force a change to 2011 estimates.

26,TRV,Wall Street surges 2 percent on Greek bank deal; trade thin,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks soared more than 2 percent in a broad rally on Monday as a merger between two big Greek banks provided a rare bit of encouraging news out of debt-stricken Europe.  A rebound in consumer spending calmed fears of a new U.S. recession and also helped lift all 10 S&P sectors. Only five S&P stocks ended in negative territory while the CBOE Volatility index .VIX, a measure of investor fear, lost 9.3 percent. But volume was low, amplifying the surge in shares.  Financial stocks were the top gainers after Greek banks Alpha (ACBr.AT) and EFG Eurobank EFGr.AT sealed a merger with help from Qatar, shoring up a sector battered by the euro zone’s debt crisis.  Insurers also rose sharply as property damage from Hurricane Irene was less than feared, according to early estimates.  The Greek deal consolidates the number of weak banks in the region and reduces the risk from one potential flashpoint that could reignite the smoldering euro zone debt crisis, which has been hanging over the global financial system. In addition, the foreign investment is a sign that investors view the region as undervalued.  “Many have come to see Greece as a lost cause, so to have a merger potentially making a strong (bank) in Greece indicates that it isn’t as dire a situation as might otherwise have been assumed,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland, Ohio.  With public transport still struggling to return to service in New York on Monday after the area’s brush with Hurricane Irene, many Wall Street firms were understaffed, contributing to the lightest volume in a month. About 6.5 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, below last year’s daily average of 8.47 billion.  “The bears stayed home in what remains a wait-and-see market, but the light volume exacerbated the day’s move,” said Dick Del Bello, senior partner at Conifer Group, a hedge fund service provider in New York. “That vacuum of light volume is allowing us to rise nicely.”  Among insurers, Dow component Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) gained 5/1 percent to $50.75, while Allstate Corp (ALL.N) jumped 8.5 percent to $26.30 and Progressive Corp (PGR.N) rose 3.6 percent to $18.89.

Consumer spending recorded its largest increase in five months in July, supporting views the economy was not falling back into recession. And while the number of signed contracts for home sales fell 1.3 percent in July, the decline matched forecasts and managed to top year-ago levels.  “Consumer spending has been in focus in the past couple of months, so any kind of strength there is a good thing for the economy and the market,” said Brian Lazorishak, portfolio manager at Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.

34,TRV,Special report:Irene wallops floundering flood insurance program,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The only thing worse than getting flooded out of your home once is getting flooded out of it twice. Or, for that matter, over and over again.  Margaret Wert bought her Wayne, New Jersey house in 1999, relying on assurances from her realtor that any occasional flooding would only amount to an inch or two of water. A week after closing, Hurricane Floyd put four feet of water in her basement.  Earlier this year, Wert, 45, got flooded again and received a payout of $5,000 on her government flood insurance, which costs her $1,200 a year. It wasn’t enough to cover her bills, but it helped with the new stove, refrigerator and boiler.  But all of Margaret Wert’s new appliances and much of her house are now ruined, after Hurricane Irene flooded broad swathes of New Jersey. This time, though, she has a message for the government insurance program.  “If they don’t buy me out and give me what I want, I am going to walk away, and they can keep it. I will tell the insurance company ‘give the check to the bank.’ You can do the repairs. You can live there in mold, you can live there in smell, I am done.”  In the United States, uniquely in the developed world, insuring homeowners against flood damage is the sole province of the federal government. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is virtually the only place to get protection against the disasters of flood and storm surge.  The problem is that the NFIP is a disaster itself, hanging on by a series of hard-fought annual extensions and the subject of a stalled reform bill in Congress. Only six years ago, taxpayers had to bail out the program after losses from Hurricane Katrina proved too much to handle.  But bailouts are not popular in Washington these days. With Congress locked in battle over the national deficit and recessionary fears looming, House Republicans are already warning that any extra money spent needs to be offset by cuts.  While Hurricane Irene was not as strong as Katrina, it has caused severe and widespread flooding in some of America’s most populated - and most expensive - areas. The storm killed at least 38 people in 11 states, in addition to three who died in the Dominican Republic and one in Puerto Rico.  In New Jersey alone, Governor Chris Christie has estimated losses could be in the tens of billions of dollars. The state has nearly $52 billion in flood insurance in force from the NFIP.  The question is whether the NFIP can handle it, and whether the losses it faces from Irene are enough to spur the Senate into passing a major reform bill that made it through the House of Representatives last month.  Moreover, if climate change believers in the insurance industry are right, and the environment is changing in unpredictable and severe ways, the flooding that results could worsen an already bad situation for the NFIP and for homeowners.  “What I do regret tremendously is because the federal government can undercut the private sector, it is now the only insurer in the floodplain management arena,” said Joe Allbaugh, the former director of FEMA under President George W. Bush, who now runs his own disaster management company.  “It spends most of its time in the red. That’s because it’s another government program (where) the premiums that are charged are way under market value, in my opinion.”  The NFIP dates to 1968, when Congress created it to help offset flood damage in quickly developing parts of the country, as well as to give communities an incentive to manage their flood risk more effectively.  From an insurance standpoint, the program is much like any other private-sector program: pay the government a certain amount and when a flood happens, receive coverage for repairs. As of June 30, the program had nearly 5.6 million policies in force with a total insured value of $1.246 trillion.  But from a fiscal standpoint FEMA does not manage the NFIP like a traditional insurer. Most insurers use a measure of solvency that looks at their capital and reserves and their ability to pay claims. In particular, regulators require insurance companies to keep a statutory reserve of liquid assets to cover potential future losses.  FEMA, on the other hand, has said it manages the NFIP to generate enough premiums to cover expenses and losses for an average loss year, rather than keeping capital for the long term. Even former agency officials admit it charges rates that dramatically underprice the risks faced.  That is all well and good in a normal year and when business is good, but when a worse-than-average loss year happens, the consequences are disastrous.  After Katrina and Rita struck in 2005, the NFIP was more or less insolvent, without the capacity to pay the huge volume of claims those hurricanes created. Congress reacted by increasing the NFIP’s borrowing ability from the U.S. Treasury more than 13-fold, to a level of nearly $21 billion.  That debt burden is, by all accounts, unsustainable. The Government Accountability Office, in a late-2006 report, said FEMA would never be able to pay off the NFIP’s debts given the level of business it was doing at the time.  While Irene was no Katrina, it comes on top of serious Midwestern flooding that the program has already had to deal with this year. Some people believe NFIP will stretch its debt boundaries and may well end up needing more assistance.  “It may be a little bit too soon to tell but it’s certainly not going to be a very good year for the NFIP and we’ve not finished the year yet,” said Robert Hartwig, an economist and the president of the Insurance Information Institute.  Hartwig said a private insurance market for flood coverage is absolutely possible, with plenty of insurers and reinsurers willing to get into the business — but only if the NFIP raises its rates and if insurers get assurances from state regulators that they will be able to do the same.  But failing those changes, the NFIP will remain the only game in town. If its already unsustainable indebtedness gets any bigger, that leaves two potential solutions to the problem: make the program bigger or forgive the debt.  The flood program would seem to have ample room to grow, given that fewer than one in 20 American households have a policy.  It is also cheap for most people. The former FEMA director Allbaugh calls it one of the best buys for taxpayers, and with average annual premiums of less than $500, it’s hard to argue.  And yet take-up is and has been anemic. Many people who buy flood insurance do so only because their mortgage lender requires them to do so as a condition of their loan. Many of them, insurance agents say, take the first opportunity they can to let the policy lapse.  “We are seeing a definite uptick in policies that are being non-renewed because people just can’t afford it,” said Patty Templeton-Jones, vice president of operations and principal NFIP coordinator at Fidelity National Indemnity Insurance Co., which is the largest writer of flood insurance policies in the United States. The NFIP largely uses private insurance companies to write and administer policies on its behalf, paying them a fee for the service.  Templeton-Jones said there is no question that Fidelity National and other flood insurance writers will see business pick up in the near term, but there is also little doubt that many of those new customers will let their policies go in two to three years, absent another disaster in their area.  Therein lies the problem, for the government and for communities that are already financially strapped: people just do not see the point of a flood policy.  Among them are Kevin Putnam’s parents. Their Brattleboro, Vermont house is now full of water, thanks to Hurricane Irene, and the potentially crushing burden of rebuilding could be stuck on their shoulders. “They have been here 50 years and this is the first time this has happened,” Putnam said. “The premium just isn’t worth it.”  Take that sentiment, multiply it across an entire town, and the result is nothing less than financial disaster.  “It’s a small state and we’re overwhelmed,” Brattleboro, Vermont town manager Barbara Sondag said. The state suffered its worst flooding in 80 years, with some 260 roads damaged or washed away entirely in the storm.  According to NFIP data as of June 30, Vermont ranks 47th of the 50 states in the number of flood policies in force, with just 1.5 percent of households covered.  In Brattleboro there are all of 99 policies on the books for a town of more than 12,000 people. Insurers like Fidelity National say there are some limited FEMA loans those people may be able to apply for, and even more limited (in size and availability) grants. But by and large, they are on their own.  If FEMA can not find a way to generate more revenue, then the only other hope for dealing with its debt is political reform. As with anything else in Washington, that is easier said than done.  In July, the House of Representatives, in a rare display of overwhelming bipartisan unity, passed an NFIP reform bill on a 406-22 vote.  The Senate, faced with the September 30 end of the current legislative session, will almost certainly not even bring that bill, or its own differing version, to a vote.  The House bill would make changes to requirements for mandatory flood purchase, as well as long-sought reforms to both the terms and rates of flood policies.  The Senate, on the other hand, is focused on its own measure, modeled on one that passed in 2008 but went nowhere thereafter. One of the cornerstones of that bill, unusually enough in the current deficit-cutting environment, is forgiveness: writing off the NFIP’s unsustainable debt entirely and essentially starting the program over from scratch.  “There is no solution that doesn’t gore somebody’s ox,” said Drew Sachs, vice president of disaster services at Witt Associates and an eight-year FEMA veteran himself.  But the man who ran the flood program during the Katrina bailout, and who spent 25 years running his own insurance agency, said the solution should be obvious.  “The debt should have been forgiven five years ago. The debt was an obligation of the federal government. The program did exactly what it was designed to do,” said David Maurstad, who was administrator of the NFIP from 2004 to 2008.  Maurstad, who is now the national director of water policy and planning for infrastructure services company Atkins North America, said it made little sense for the government to bail out insurers like AIG during the financial crisis and yet leave its own insurance program with an unsustainable debt.  Yet neither chamber is even close to agreeing with the other, which means that sometime before September 30, Congress is likely to do what it has done annually in recent years — pass a one-year reauthorization for the NFIP that solves nothing but lets the program stay in business.  “Irene will highlight the need for renewal (of the NFIP), but it will not remove the obstacles to passage,” said Robert Gordon, senior vice president for policy at the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America.  The other complication is immediate cost. If NFIP does need more money, House Republicans quickly made clear those funds would have to be at the expense of something else.  “We’ll find other places to save so that we can fund this kind of role that the federal government needs to play,” House Majority Leader Eric Cantor told Fox News this week. “In instances like this, yes, there’s a federal role, yes, we can find the money. We’re just going to need to make sure there are savings elsewhere to continue to do so.”  People who were flooded have 30 days from the storm’s impact to file claims. When they get paid, though, will depend in large part on whether the NFIP accepts their claims or not.  (For answers on insurance coverage questions, see: ""Are you covered?"" - link.reuters.com/hag53s )  One of the problems that is likely to emerge in “Irene country” is one that people in Texas, Louisiana and Florida already know all too well — the legal conundrum of wind versus flood.  Simply put, in many cases an insurer will tell a homeowner their damage was caused by flood, and to call FEMA. In some cases, FEMA will tell the same homeowner that no, their damage was caused by wind, and instruct them to call the company that provides their homeowners’ insurance.  Enter the lawyers.  “There’s a big issue under homeowners’ insurance, and I would say maybe the most common issue, would be causation,” said Robert Berg, an insurance litigator and partner at Michelman & Robinson in San Francisco.  “It’s a problem with the legal process. If you have somebody at your house and they’re doing work, a contractor will say ‘It’s not my fault, it’s the other contractor’s fault.’ It’s the same thing.”  Berg and other attorneys say the legal issue of causation is, especially after Hurricane Katrina, fairly well defined in the more traditionally hurricane-prone parts of the country.  But in the northeast, where for some places a hurricane is a once-a-century event, the case law does not yet exist.  “Because there hasn’t been as much litigation in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast as there has been down south, it’s hard to say,” said Barry Buchman, an insurance litigator with Gilbert LLP in Washington.  Michelman & Robinson’s Berg said in a situation like this, the law may well be written on the fly.  “If it’s really horrific and you get enough attorneys involved, then they’ll think of ways to create coverage,” he said.  While politicians and lawyers battle over who pays, it’s the homeowners who suffer.  According to catastrophe modeling company Eqecat, Irene was an unusually wide, wet and slow storm, which made for ideal flooding conditions in parts of the northeast that had already experienced one of the wettest Augusts ever.  For people who live in New Jersey and suffered flooding damage earlier this year, having to suffer it again - and deal with insurance claims all over again - may be too much to handle.  Jonathan McNamara of Fairfield, New Jersey, said his parents just got their insurance checks a week ago for flooding from March, and now their home is flooded again.  “They have given us money but getting it is a whole other story,” said McNamara, 22, who lives with his parents. “It’s very time consuming and a very frustrating process.”  ",8302011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-irene-flood/special-reportirene-wallops-floundering-flood-insurance-program-idUSTRE77T5M620110830
35,TRV,Irene losses less than once feared,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene caused $3 billion to $6 billion in insured losses, catastrophe modeling company AIR Worldwide said on Monday, affirming the insurance industry’s suspicion the impact was not as bad as feared.  In the days leading up to Irene, some had expected a $10 billion hit, though as Irene actually made land it appeared the storm was not doing the damage it was expected to do. AIR, whose estimate covers U.S. onshore properties, develops software that insurers use to model exposure to disasters.  Insurance shares rallied sharply on Monday, far outpacing the broader market, on relief the payouts would not be as bad as they could have been.  Even so, some analysts said the storm may have been something of a worst-case scenario for large U.S. property insurers such as Allstate Corp and Travelers Companies Inc, enough to wipe out some or all of their third-quarter earnings, but not enough to cause an industrywide increase in prices after years of weakness.  Allstate shares rose 8.5 percent and Travelers rose 5.1 percent, in line with European insurers, which rose on relief the damage from Irene was not as bad as feared. Twenty of the 22 companies in the S&P insurance index outperformed the broader market.  Millions of people throughout the Northeastern United States were still flooded and without electricity on Monday, particularly in rural Vermont and suburban New Jersey. Totaling those losses is expected to take time, as is the process of figuring out how many of the affected had government-backed flood insurance.  By some accounts, the insured losses in the Carolinas were as little as $200 million after the storm made landfall there Saturday.  Before the hurricane, some feared Irene could be a $10 billion event or more. Analysts and insurance executives suggested something above $15 billion could bring a structural change to the insurance market, pushing prices higher around the world after three years of weakness.  It seemed unlikely Irene would hit that mark, with trade groups such as the Insurance Information Institute and the Property and Casualty Insurers of America saying estimates below $5 billion sounded right.  “The impact to insurers from Irene is probably not large enough to cause increased pricing and will not result in a broad (property and casualty) cycle turn because we estimate there is still least $100 billion of excess U.S. P&C industry capital,” Barclays Capital said in a note on Monday.  Between the Caribbean and the Carolinas, AIR competitor Eqecat has estimated losses of no more than $1 billion. AIR Worldwide has previously forecast losses of $1.1 billion just for the Caribbean. The third key player in catastrophe modeling for the insurance industry, RMS, has not weighed in with a figure.  On Monday, RMS did say the damage so far is much more likely to be from flood and storm surge than wind, which would get the insurance industry off the hook for most of the losses and push the payout burden onto the National Flood Insurance Program.  The shares of the world’s top three reinsurers — Munich Re, Swiss Re and Hannover Re — rose 4 to 6 percent as analysts said they did not expect that any losses would force a change to 2011 estimates.  This year already was the most expensive for natural disasters, mostly because of the costs of the March earthquake in Japan.

36,TRV,"Insurers escape Irene's wrath, economy does not","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene may heap billions of dollars of extra costs on the already fragile U.S. economy, but insurance companies are likely to emerge relatively unscathed.  Most of Irene’s damage was from flooding, which the government insures, instead of wind, which insurance companies cover, meaning insurers could pay out as little as $1.5 billion by some early estimates.  That’s just a fraction of the $10 billion to $12 billion of economic damage that Irene likely caused, according to estimates from catastrophe modelers and ratings agencies. Moody’s Analytics said the storm might take a tenth of a percentage point off third-quarter gross domestic product.  The question now for insurers is whether the insured losses are bad enough to eat up third-quarter earnings, which some analysts believe is the case, and whether the losses are enough to let insurers raise rates, which many analysts doubt.  “Obviously we’re still early in a process. For the third quarter we build pretty substantial catastrophe loads into our estimates. While there’s a wide range we feel like we’ve got some conservatism built into our numbers,” said Larry Greenberg, an analyst at Janney Capital Markets unit Langen McAlenney who covers insurers.  Insurers have already suffered big blows from other disasters this year, and their disaster losses for the first half of 2011 are well above total levels for 2010.  But figuring out how Irene will affect earnings is difficult because modeling hurricane losses is so tricky, on top of the usual challenge of forecasting insurance earnings.  For example, Dow industrials component Travelers Companies Inc (TRV.N) has reported results that are at least 20 cents different from Wall Street’s estimates for four quarters running, sometimes to the upside and sometimes to the downside.  What is clear, though, is that insurance stocks are rallying after Irene. Last week, as the storm approached and worst-case scenarios were bandied about, the insurance sector underperformed the broader market by half. This week, with the relief of a more moderate hit from Irene, insurers are at least a third better than the market in general.  “At the end of the day, last week the underperformance was the result of fear that Irene could be the storm that CNN and Weather Channel were talking about, a worst-case scenario for New York and the northeast,” said Matthew Carletti, an analyst at JMP Securities. “The fact is, the storm weakened. You still had damage, but it was pretty modest.”  Carletti said it appeared investors had been more concerned about the downside pressure a major storm could cause on earnings than the upside pressure it would exert on insurance pricing across the sector.  By many standards, Irene could have been much worse. The economic damage it wreaked was just a fraction of the damage from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 or Andrew in 1992.  But the U.S. economy is fragile now, and the hurricane hardly helps. U.S. gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of just one percentage point in the second quarter, so shaving a tenth of a percentage point off could be material.  Analysts also warned of potential inflation from what is known as “demand surge,” where people try to make repairs in short order and drive up many local prices.  For insurers, the losses could be somewhere between $1.5 billion to $2.8 billion, catastrophe modeling agency Eqecat said early Wednesday.  That is far less than the estimate from competitor AIR Worldwide, which suggested losses would range from $3 billion to $6 billion.  While it is not unusual for the two to differ in their estimates, the trend is clearly toward Irene costing the insurance industry much less than had been feared. In the days before Irene made landfall, many were predicting a $10 billion event or worse.  If AIR Worldwide is correct, Irene would rank as one of the 10 costliest hurricanes in U.S. history by level of insured losses. However, the lower end of Eqecat’s estimate would put Irene well out of that range.  That said, it is still a blow to insurers, given estimates that they suffered $27 billion in catastrophe losses in the first six months of the year — nearly 50 percent more than they lost in all of 2010.  For the last three years, when losses were less than they have been lately, insurance prices have been mostly falling, given excess capacity and heavy competition.  There have been enough natural disasters this year to eat up some of that extra capacity, such that insurance brokerage Marsh said this month price declines have stopped. But going into Irene, most analysts thought it would need to be a $15 billion event to “harden” the market, or pressure enough insurers to spur widespread price increases.  “People do get nervous about earnings and estimates cuts and instinctively tend to sell while the news is out there. The consideration of what it does to pricing happens a couple of weeks or more down the road,” Langen McAlenney’S Greenberg said.  Given the relatively limited losses, ratings agency A.M. Best said the industry should have no problem absorbing the costs. While analysts have said losses could wipe out third-quarter earnings, it appears that will be the extent of the damage, leaving insurers’ balance sheets intact.  “Despite the considerable catastrophe losses recorded through the first half of 2011, the overall (property insurance) industry remains adequately capitalized,” Best said in a report. “Accordingly, Hurricane Irene is not a solvency event from an industrywide perspective.”  Fitch Ratings also said on Wednesday that losses would be “material but manageable” for insurers and that no ratings actions were expected.  By market share, the largest insurers in the storm-hit states of New York, New Jersey and North Carolina include State Farm, Allstate Corp (ALL.N), Liberty Mutual and Chubb Corp (CB.N), according to A.M. Best.  “I think it’s difficult going into it and it’s difficult coming out of it,” said Tom Lewandowski, an analyst at Edward Jones. “It’s more important to take a longer-term outlook because (insurance) profitability doesn’t really exist on a quarter-by-quarter basis.”  ",8312011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-insurance-irene/insurers-escape-irenes-wrath-economy-does-not-idUSTRE77U5WU20110831

38,TRV,Special report: Irene wallops flood insurance program,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The only thing worse than getting flooded out of your home once is getting flooded out of it twice. Or, for that matter, over and over again.  Margaret Wert bought her Wayne, New Jersey house in 1999, relying on assurances from her realtor that any occasional flooding would only amount to an inch or two of water. A week after closing, Hurricane Floyd put four feet of water in her basement.  Earlier this year, Wert, 45, got flooded again and received a payout of $5,000 on her government flood insurance, which costs her $1,200 a year. It wasn’t enough to cover her bills, but it helped with the new stove, refrigerator and boiler.  But all of Margaret Wert’s new appliances and much of her house are now ruined, after Hurricane Irene flooded broad swathes of New Jersey. This time, though, she has a message for the government insurance program.  “If they don’t buy me out and give me what I want, I am going to walk away, and they can keep it. I will tell the insurance company ‘give the check to the bank.’ You can do the repairs. You can live there in mold, you can live there in smell, I am done.”  In the United States, uniquely in the developed world, insuring homeowners against flood damage is the sole province of the federal government. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is virtually the only place to get protection against the disasters of flood and storm surge.  The problem is that the NFIP is a disaster itself, hanging on by a series of hard-fought annual extensions and the subject of a stalled reform bill in Congress. Only six years ago, taxpayers had to bail out the program after losses from Hurricane Katrina proved too much to handle.  But bailouts are not popular in Washington these days. With Congress locked in battle over the national deficit and recessionary fears looming, House Republicans are already warning that any extra money spent needs to be offset by cuts.  While Hurricane Irene was not as strong as Katrina, it has caused severe and widespread flooding in some of America’s most populated - and most expensive - areas. The storm killed at least 38 people in 11 states, in addition to three who died in the Dominican Republic and one in Puerto Rico.  In New Jersey alone, Governor Chris Christie has estimated losses could be in the tens of billions of dollars. The state has nearly $52 billion in flood insurance in force from the NFIP.  The question is whether the NFIP can handle it, and whether the losses it faces from Irene are enough to spur the U.S. Senate into passing a major reform bill that made it through the House of Representatives last month.  Moreover, if climate change believers in the insurance industry are right, and the environment is changing in unpredictable and severe ways, the flooding that results could worsen an already bad situation for the NFIP and for homeowners.  “What I do regret tremendously is because the federal government can undercut the private sector, it is now the only insurer in the floodplain management arena,” said Joe Allbaugh, the former director of FEMA under President George W. Bush, who now runs his own disaster management company.  “It spends most of its time in the red. That’s because it’s another government program (where) the premiums that are charged are way under market value, in my opinion.”  The NFIP dates to 1968, when Congress created it to help offset flood damage in quickly developing parts of the country, as well as to give communities an incentive to manage their flood risk more effectively.  From an insurance standpoint, the program is much like any other private-sector program: pay the government a certain amount and when a flood happens, receive coverage for repairs. As of June 30, the program had nearly 5.6 million policies in force with a total insured value of $1.246 trillion.  But from a fiscal standpoint FEMA does not manage the NFIP like a traditional insurer. Most insurers use a measure of solvency that looks at their capital and reserves and their ability to pay claims. In particular, regulators require insurance companies to keep a statutory reserve of liquid assets to cover potential future losses.  FEMA, on the other hand, has said it manages the NFIP to generate enough premiums to cover expenses and losses for an average loss year, rather than keeping capital for the long term. Even former agency officials admit it charges rates that dramatically underprice the risks faced.  That is all well and good in a normal year and when business is good, but when a worse-than-average loss year happens, the consequences are disastrous.  After Katrina and Rita struck in 2005, the NFIP was more or less insolvent, without the capacity to pay the huge volume of claims those hurricanes created. Congress reacted by increasing the NFIP’s borrowing ability from the U.S. Treasury more than 13-fold, to a level of nearly $21 billion.  That debt burden is, by all accounts, unsustainable. The Government Accountability Office, in a late-2006 report, said FEMA would never be able to pay off the NFIP’s debts given the level of business it was doing at the time.  While Irene was no Katrina, it comes on top of serious Midwestern flooding that the program has already had to deal with this year. Some people believe NFIP will stretch its debt boundaries and may well end up needing more assistance.  “It may be a little bit too soon to tell but it’s certainly not going to be a very good year for the NFIP and we’ve not finished the year yet,” said Robert Hartwig, an economist and the president of the Insurance Information Institute.  Hartwig said a private insurance market for flood coverage is absolutely possible, with plenty of insurers and reinsurers willing to get into the business — but only if the NFIP raises its rates and if insurers get assurances from state regulators that they will be able to do the same.  But failing those changes, the NFIP will remain the only game in town. If its already unsustainable indebtedness gets any bigger, that leaves two potential solutions to the problem: make the program bigger or forgive the debt.  The flood program would seem to have ample room to grow, given that fewer than one in 20 American households have a policy.  It is also cheap for most people. The former FEMA director Allbaugh calls it one of the best buys for taxpayers, and with average annual premiums of less than $500, it’s hard to argue.  And yet take-up is and has been anemic. Many people who buy flood insurance do so only because their mortgage lender requires them to do so as a condition of their loan. Many of them, insurance agents say, take the first opportunity they can to let the policy lapse.  “We are seeing a definite uptick in policies that are being non-renewed because people just can’t afford it,” said Patty Templeton-Jones, vice president of operations and principal NFIP coordinator at Fidelity National Indemnity Insurance Co., which is the largest writer of flood insurance policies in the United States. The NFIP largely uses private insurance companies to write and administer policies on its behalf, paying them a fee for the service.  Templeton-Jones said there is no question that Fidelity National and other flood insurance writers will see business pick up in the near term, but there is also little doubt that many of those new customers will let their policies go in two to three years, absent another disaster in their area.  Therein lies the problem, for the government and for communities that are already financially strapped: people just do not see the point of a flood policy.  Among them are Kevin Putnam’s parents. Their Brattleboro, Vermont house is now full of water, thanks to Hurricane Irene, and the potentially crushing burden of rebuilding could be stuck on their shoulders. “They have been here 50 years and this is the first time this has happened,” Putnam said. “The premium just isn’t worth it.”  Take that sentiment, multiply it across an entire town, and the result is nothing less than financial disaster.  “It’s a small state and we’re overwhelmed,” Brattleboro, Vermont town manager Barbara Sondag said. The state suffered its worst flooding in 80 years, with some 260 roads damaged or washed away entirely in the storm.  According to NFIP data as of June 30, Vermont ranks 47th of the 50 states in the number of flood policies in force, with just 1.5 percent of households covered.  In Brattleboro there are all of 99 policies on the books for a town of more than 12,000 people. Insurers like Fidelity National say there are some limited FEMA loans those people may be able to apply for, and even more limited (in size and availability) grants. But by and large, they are on their own.  If FEMA can not find a way to generate more revenue, then the only other hope for dealing with its debt is political reform. As with anything else in Washington, that is easier said than done.  In July, the U.S. House of Representatives, in a rare display of overwhelming bipartisan unity, passed an NFIP reform bill on a 406-22 vote.  The U.S. Senate, faced with the September 30 end of the current legislative session, will almost certainly not even bring that bill, or its own differing version, to a vote.  The House bill would make changes to requirements for mandatory flood purchase, as well as long-sought reforms to both the terms and rates of flood policies.  The Senate, on the other hand, is focused on its own measure, modeled on one that passed in 2008 but went nowhere thereafter. One of the cornerstones of that bill, unusually enough in the current deficit-cutting environment, is forgiveness: writing off the NFIP’s unsustainable debt entirely and essentially starting the program over from scratch.  “There is no solution that doesn’t gore somebody’s ox,” said Drew Sachs, vice president of disaster services at Witt Associates and an eight-year FEMA veteran himself.  But the man who ran the flood program during the Katrina bailout, and who spent 25 years running his own insurance agency, said the solution should be obvious.  “The debt should have been forgiven five years ago. The debt was an obligation of the federal government. The program did exactly what it was designed to do,” said David Maurstad, who was administrator of the NFIP from 2004 to 2008.  Maurstad, who is now the national director of water policy and planning for infrastructure services company Atkins North America, said it made little sense for the government to bail out insurers like AIG during the financial crisis and yet leave its own insurance program with an unsustainable debt.  Yet neither chamber is even close to agreeing with the other, which means that sometime before September 30, Congress is likely to do what it has done annually in recent years — pass a one-year reauthorization for the NFIP that solves nothing but lets the program stay in business.  “Irene will highlight the need for renewal (of the NFIP), but it will not remove the obstacles to passage,” said Robert Gordon, senior vice president for policy at the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America.  The other complication is immediate cost. If NFIP does need more money, House Republicans quickly made clear those funds would have to be at the expense of something else.  “We’ll find other places to save so that we can fund this kind of role that the federal government needs to play,” House Majority Leader Eric Cantor told Fox News this week. “In instances like this, yes, there’s a federal role, yes, we can find the money. We’re just going to need to make sure there are savings elsewhere to continue to do so.”  People who were flooded have 30 days from the storm’s impact to file claims. When they get paid, though, will depend in large part on whether the NFIP accepts their claims or not.  (For answers on insurance coverage questions, see: ""Are you covered?"" - link.reuters.com/hag53s )  One of the problems that is likely to emerge in “Irene country” is one that people in Texas, Louisiana and Florida already know all too well — the legal conundrum of wind versus flood.  Simply put, in many cases an insurer will tell a homeowner their damage was caused by flood, and to call FEMA. In some cases, FEMA will tell the same homeowner that no, their damage was caused by wind, and instruct them to call the company that provides their homeowners’ insurance.  Enter the lawyers.  “There’s a big issue under homeowners’ insurance, and I would say maybe the most common issue, would be causation,” said Robert Berg, an insurance litigator and partner at Michelman & Robinson in San Francisco.  “It’s a problem with the legal process. If you have somebody at your house and they’re doing work, a contractor will say ‘It’s not my fault, it’s the other contractor’s fault.’ It’s the same thing.”  Berg and other attorneys say the legal issue of causation is, especially after Hurricane Katrina, fairly well defined in the more traditionally hurricane-prone parts of the country.  But in the northeast, where for some places a hurricane is a once-a-century event, the case law does not yet exist.  “Because there hasn’t been as much litigation in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast as there has been down south, it’s hard to say,” said Barry Buchman, an insurance litigator with Gilbert LLP in Washington.  Michelman & Robinson’s Berg said in a situation like this, the law may well be written on the fly.  “If it’s really horrific and you get enough attorneys involved, then they’ll think of ways to create coverage,” he said.  While politicians and lawyers battle over who pays, it’s the homeowners who suffer.  According to catastrophe modeling company Eqecat, Irene was an unusually wide, wet and slow storm, which made for ideal flooding conditions in parts of the northeast that had already experienced one of the wettest Augusts ever.  For people who live in New Jersey and suffered flooding damage earlier this year, having to suffer it again - and deal with insurance claims all over again - may be too much to handle.  Jonathan McNamara of Fairfield, New Jersey, said his parents just got their insurance checks a week ago for flooding from March, and now their home is flooded again.  “They have given us money but getting it is a whole other story,” said McNamara, 22, who lives with his parents. “It’s very time consuming and a very frustrating process.”  ",8312011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-irene-flood/special-report-irene-wallops-flood-insurance-program-idUSTRE77T5M620110831
39,TRV,Scenarios - Katia and Lee threaten insurance companies,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Lee is passing slowly over the Gulf Coast region of the southern United States, while Hurricane Katia is keeping forecasters guessing about where it will go and how fast it will get there.  Both could be disastrous to the insurance industry and the federal government, at a time when insurers are already dealing with the worst natural disaster year in history and the government is caught up in a fight over deficit cutting.  Following are best- and worst-case scenarios for both storms and the insurance industry.  Tropical Storm Lee is, from an insurance perspective, overwhelmingly a flooding event. That makes it the province of the National Flood Insurance Program, which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and which writes almost all of the homeowners flood insurance in this country.  The NFIP does not run a surplus, as a normal insurer does; rather, it operates with the goal of taking in enough premiums every year to cover its losses, with excess going to pay down the massive debt it had to take on after Hurricane Katrina.  While Lee has caused extensive flooding, there is evidence that the levee system protecting Louisiana communities has held, with only limited waters going over their tops.  New Orleans television station WWL reported the city was in many ways operating normally, with buses running and Armstrong International Airport open and operational.  That could ease fears that Lee would prove too much for the NFIP to handle, on top of the heavy claims the program is likely to receive from last weekend’s Hurricane Irene.  While New Orleans has held up relatively well from Lee, other parts of Louisiana are not doing as well.  WWL said Plaquemines Parish was working to bolster its last-resort flood protections as the water rose from Lee. NFIP data show the parish is one of the most heavily insured areas of the state, which itself is one of the most-insured parts of the country against flood.  If the parish is inundated, that would add to the flood program’s headaches. Beyond that one parish, though, the other problem is that Lee is far from being done dumping water on the southeastern part of the country.  “The primary threat from Lee will be extremely heavy rainfall over much of the southeastern U.S. during (the) next several days,” the National Hurricane Center said Sunday evening, adding that Lee appeared likely to remain a tropical storm for another 36 hours.  Catastrophe modeling company Eqecat said on Sunday that the storm’s slow progress was compounding the damage.  “Several smaller rivers in the region are at or approaching flood stage, and more regional flooding is expected as Lee progresses toward Tennessee during the next few days,” said the company, which provides software to insurers allowing them to model their exposure to disasters.  More flooding could push the NFIP to borrow in order to cover its claims, adding to a debt burden the Government Accountability Office has said it can never repay.  Even as Lee lingers, Hurricane Katia has an ongoing — and confounding — presence in the Atlantic.  The storm has wavered in and out of hurricane strength for days, and consistently not done what hurricane forecasters have expected it to do.  The latest iterations of their models are literally all over the map — some of the six NHC models put Katia in the Bahamas or the Carolinas in about a week, some suggest New Jersey or Massachusetts are at risk and some predict Katia will simply hook hard right and miss land entirely.  That last scenario is the best, in that it will let insurers off the hook for more losses. As of Friday afternoon, State Farm — the country’s largest home and auto insurer — had already received nearly 63,000 claims for Irene.  Other leading home and auto insurers like Allstate Corp, Chubb Corp and Travelers Companies Inc are already at risk of having third-quarter earnings wiped out by those kinds of claims, analysts have said.  As much as insurers might like to see Katia turn away, there is still that chance that the storm might make a U.S. landfall.  Global insurers and reinsurers have already suffered catastrophe losses of more than $70 billion this year, by industry estimates, including up to $6 billion in the United States from Irene.  Further hurricane losses would go further in wiping out third-quarter profits and make it harder for insurers to report an underwriting profit for the year.  “It’s more important to take a longer-term outlook because profitability doesn’t really exist on a quarter-by-quarter basis” with insurance, said Tom Lewandowski, an analyst at Edward Jones, in an interview earlier this week. “Inherently it’s a difficult, opaque type of item to think about but conservatism is the way I look at it.”  If Katia makes a turn toward U.S. land, it would also put pressure on insurers’ shares. Stocks fell in the week before Irene made landfall, only to rally in the week after as it became clear damage was less than expectations.

40,TRV,SCENARIOS-Katia and Lee threaten insurance companies," * Lee brings heavy flooding to well-insured Louisiana   * Hurricane Katia could strike U.S. or turn away   * 2011 already worst disaster year in history   By Ben Berkowitz   NEW YORK, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Lee is passing slowly over the Gulf Coast region of the southern United States, while Hurricane Katia is keeping forecasters guessing about where it will go and how fast it will get there.   Both could be disastrous to the insurance industry and the federal government at a time when insurers are already dealing with the worst natural disaster year in history and the government is caught up in a fight over deficit cutting.   Following are best- and worst-case scenarios for both storms and the insurance industry.   Tropical Storm Lee is, from an insurance perspective, overwhelmingly a flooding event. That makes it the province of the National Flood Insurance Program, which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and which writes almost all of the homeowners flood insurance in this country.   The NFIP does not run a surplus, as a normal insurer does; rather, it operates with the goal of taking in enough premiums every year to cover its losses, with excess going to pay down the massive debt it had to take on after Hurricane Katrina.   While Lee has caused extensive flooding, there is evidence that the levee system protecting Louisiana communities has held, with only limited waters going over the top.   New Orleans television station WWL reported the city was in many ways operating normally, with buses running and Armstrong International Airport open and operational.   That could ease fears that Lee would prove too much for the NFIP to handle, on top of the heavy claims the program is likely to receive from last weekend’s Hurricane Irene.   While New Orleans has held up relatively well from Lee, other parts of Louisiana are not doing as well.   WWL said Plaquemines Parish was working to bolster its last-resort flood protection as the waters rose from Lee. NFIP data show the parish is one of the most heavily insured areas in the state, which itself is one of the most flood-insured parts of the country.   If the parish is inundated, that would add to the flood program’s headaches. Beyond that one parish, though, the other problem is that Lee is far from being done dumping water on the southeastern part of the country.   “The primary threat from Lee will be extremely heavy rainfall over much of the southeastern U.S. during (the) next several days,” the National Hurricane Center said Sunday evening, adding that Lee appeared likely to remain a tropical storm for another 36 hours.   Catastrophe modeling company Eqecat said on Sunday that the storm’s slow progress was compounding the damage.   “Several smaller rivers in the region are at or approaching flood stage, and more regional flooding is expected as Lee progresses toward Tennessee during the next few days,” said the company, which provides software to insurers allowing them to model their exposure to disasters.   More flooding could push the NFIP to borrow in order to cover its claims, adding to a burden of debt the Government Accountability Office has said it can never repay.   Even as Lee lingers, Hurricane Katia has an ongoing, and confounding, presence in the Atlantic.   The storm has wavered in and out of hurricane strength for days, and consistently not done what hurricane forecasters have expected it to do.   The latest iterations of their models are literally all over the map — some of the six NHC models put Katia in the Bahamas or the Carolinas in about a week, others suggest New Jersey or Massachusetts are at risk and still others predict Katia will simply hook hard right and miss land entirely.   That last scenario is the best, in that it will let insurers off the hook for more losses. As of Friday afternoon, State Farm, the country’s largest home and auto insurer, had already received nearly 63,000 claims for Irene.   Other leading home and auto insurers like Allstate Corp (ALL.N), Chubb Corp (CB.N) and Travelers Companies Inc (TRV.N) are already at risk of having third-quarter earnings wiped out by those kinds of claims, analysts have said.   As much as insurers might like to see Katia turn away, there is still that chance that the storm might make a U.S. landfall.   Global insurers and reinsurers have already suffered catastrophe losses of more than $70 billion this year, by industry estimates, including up to $6 billion in the United States from Irene.   Further hurricane losses would dramatically increase the risk third-quarter profits could be wiped out, coming on top of the losses from Irene.   “It’s more important to take a longer-term outlook because profitability doesn’t really exist on a quarter-by-quarter basis” with insurance, said Tom Lewandowski, an analyst at Edward Jones, in an interview earlier this week. “Inherently it’s a difficult, opaque type of item to think about but conservatism is the way I look at it.”   If Katia makes a turn toward U.S. land, it would also put pressure on insurers’ shares.

42,TRV,Senate advances bill for flood insurance,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Senate committee advanced a bill to approve billions of dollars in funding for national flood insurance just weeks before the troubled program is set to expire and as a series of storms swamps the country.  The bill would reform the National Flood Insurance Program, which insures millions of U.S. property owners, and keep it afloat for five years.  It must go to the full Senate for a vote and then be reconciled with the version the House of Representatives passed this summer.  It is unclear if that will happen before the program is due to expire on September 30, but members of the Senate Banking Committee were optimistic about the progress.  “We’ve worked hard on this. We’ve worked on it for years. It’s a complicated bill and I think we’re going in the right direction,” said Senator Richard Shelby, the most powerful Republican on the Banking Committee.  The bill would address premium increases, levy-building, business interruption insurance and floods in progress. Both Democrats and Republicans on the committee, though, described it as unfinished.  “We have agreement in principle. We couldn’t cross all of our T’s and dot all of the I’s last night,” said New York’s Charles Schumer, a Democrat.  The NFIP insures homeowners against flood damage and is virtually the only place to get protection against storms.  It is managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Policies are sold by dozens of private insurers, with premiums going to FEMA.  The NFIP had to be bailed out by taxpayers after it was swamped by claims from Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Now it is roughly $18 billion in debt and unable to pay the money back.  A series of abrupt program expirations and annual renewals have created uncertainty and roiled the market.  “I want a full-blown multi-year reauthorization. I don’t want to let up pressure on that at all,” said Senator David Vitter, a Republican from Louisiana.  “But I think it’s going to be clearly uphill to do that before September 30. I hope we all work together and make sure well ahead of September 30 we pass any necessary extension.”  While August’s Hurricane Irene was not as strong as Katrina, it caused severe and widespread flooding in some of America’s most populated — and most expensive — areas. As Vermont and other Northern states recover from Irene, Southern states are currently contending with Tropical Storm Lee and the country is bracing for a hit from approaching Hurricane Katia.

44,TRV,Text-Fitch affirms Travelers' ratings; outlook stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency.) CHICAGO, September 08 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed its ratings on The Travelers (TRV.N) Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TRV), as follows: —Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at ‘A+’; —Senior unsecured notes at ‘A’; —Subordinated notes at ‘BBB+’; —Insurer financial strength (IFS) on insurance company subsidiaries at ‘AA’. See the full list of rating actions below. The Rating Outlooks are Stable. The affirmation of TRV’s ratings reflects the company’s strong competitive position, history of solid earnings and prudent capital management. Balanced against these positives are the heavy year-to-date catastrophe losses and the company’s large investment allocation to municipal bonds. TRV is the 6th largest, U.S. property/casualty insurer with a market share of nearly 5%. TRV has diversified product offerings and frequently occupies a top five position among independent insurance agencies, supporting its strong competitive position. A history of solid earnings can be seen in TRV’s 14.6% 5-year average return on equity through year-end 2010. Total return to shareholders over the same 5-year period was 41% compared to 12% for the S&P 500. Financial results have suffered year-to-date given heavy catastrophe losses. Specifically, weather-related losses during the first half of 2011 reached $1.2 billion, reducing bottom line results to $475 million compared to $1.3 billion over the same period in 2010. TRV continues to exhibit prudent capital management as evidenced by a debt-to-capital ratio of 20.9% at June 30, 2011. This level of financial leverage is consistent with Fitch’s expectation that debt-to-capital ratio will be managed within a range of 20% - 25%. Share repurchase activity has moderated considerably in light of heavy weather-related losses during 2011. Capitalization measures at the consolidated insurance operating companies such as total financing and commitments ratio and operating leverage remain conservative at 0.35 times (x) and 1.1x, respectively at year-end 2010. Financial flexibility is enhanced by significant holding company liquidity with cash, short-term invested assets, and other readily marketable securities totaling $2.4 billion as of June 30, 2011. Additional flexibility is provided by subsidiaries that can pay up to $3.5 billion of dividends during 2011 without prior regulatory approval. TRV’s liquidity profile is supplemented by an $800 million commercial paper program that is backed by a three-year $1.0 billion syndicated credit facility that expires in June 2013. The company is a large investor in state, municipal, and revenue bonds, holding $39 billion at June 30, 2011. This asset class is experiencing a heightened level of stress given the fiscal problems of many states and municipalities. Fitch’s concerns about TRV’s municipal bond holdings are largely mitigated by the portfolio’s diversity and high credit quality. Key rating drivers that could lead to a downgrade include: —Capitalization at the underwriting subsidiaries that is inconsistent with standards for the current rating category or a long-term increase in debt-to-total capital ratio to greater than 25%. —A sustained period of net losses or catastrophe losses out of proportion with the company’s market share. Key rating drivers that could lead to an upgrade include:      —A substantially overcapitalized position relative to TRV’s current rating level. However, given publicly traded companies’ sensitivity around managing capital, this level of overcapitalization is unlikely. —Sustained underwriting performance across business lines that is clearly better than the industry and similarly-rated peers. The following ratings have been affirmed by Fitch, with a Stable Outlook: The Travelers Companies, Inc. —IDR at ‘A+’; —Short-term IDR at ‘F1’ —5.375% senior notes due June 15, 2012 at ‘A’; —5.50% senior notes due Dec. 1, 2015 at ‘A’; —6.25% senior notes due June 20, 2016 at ‘A’; —5.75% senior notes due Dec. 15, 2017 at ‘A’; —5.80% senior notes due May 15, 2018 at ‘A’; —5.90% senior notes due June 2, 2019 at ‘A’; —3.90% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2020 at ‘A’; —6.75% senior notes due June 20, 2036 at ‘A’; —6.25% senior notes due June 15, 2037 at ‘A’; —5.35% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2040 at ‘A’. —6.25% junior subordinated debentures due March 15, 2067 at ‘BBB+’; —$800 million commercial paper (CP) program at ‘F1’. MMI Capital Trust I —7.625% Trust preferred due Dec. 15, 2027 at ‘BBB+’. USF&G Capital Trust I —8.500% Trust preferred due Dec. 15, 2045 at ‘BBB+’. USF&G Capital Trust III —8.312% Trust preferred due July 1, 2046 at ‘BBB+’. Travelers Insurance Group Holdings Inc. —IDR ‘A+’; —7.75% senior notes due April 15, 2026 at ‘A’. Travelers Property Casualty Corp. —IDR ‘A+’; —5.00% senior notes due March 15, 2013 at ‘A’; —6.375% senior notes due March 15, 2033 at ‘A’; The IFS ratings of the following members of the Travelers Inter-company Pool have been affirmed at ‘AA’, with a Stable Outlook: —St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company —The Travelers Indemnity Company —Travelers Casualty and Surety Company —The Phoenix Insurance Company —The Standard Fire Insurance Company —United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company —Travelers Casualty Insurance Company of America —Farmington Casualty Company —The Automobile Insurance Company of Hartford, Connecticut —The Travelers Indemnity Company of Connecticut —The Charter Oak Fire Insurance Company —St. Paul Surplus Lines Insurance Company —The Travelers Indemnity Company of America —St. Paul Protective Insurance Company —Travelers Casualty Company of Connecticut —Travelers Commercial Casualty Company —Travelers Commercial Insurance Company —St. Paul Mercury Insurance Company —Travelers Property Casualty Company of America —Travelers Property Casualty Insurance Company —Athena Assurance Company —St. Paul Medical Liability Insurance Company —TravCo Insurance Company —Travelers Excess and Surplus Lines Company —The Travelers Home and Marine Insurance Company —Travelers Personal Security Insurance Company —Travelers Personal Insurance Company —Discover Property & Casualty Insurance Company —Discover Specialty Insurance Company —Fidelity and Guaranty Insurance Underwriters, Inc. —St. Paul Guardian Insurance Company —American Equity Specialty Insurance Company —Northfield Insurance Company —Northland Insurance Company —Northland Casualty Company In addition, the IFS ratings of the following members of the Travelers Group have been affirmed at ‘AA’, with a Stable Outlook: —Fidelity and Guaranty Insurance Company —Select Insurance Company —St. Paul Fire and Casualty Insurance Company —The Travelers Lloyds Insurance Company —Travelers Lloyds of Texas Insurance Company —First Floridian Auto and Home Insurance Company —First Trenton Indemnity Company —Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America —Gulf Underwriters Insurance Company The rating for Travelers Auto Insurance Co. of New Jersey was withdrawn following its merger into Fidelity and Guaranty Insurance Underwriters, Inc.

45,TRV,"UPDATE 3-Hartford disaster losses up, Travelers' rates rise"," * Hartford attributes most of losses to Irene   * Travelers says rates mostly strong in the third quarter  (Adds Travelers, updates shares)   Sept 12 (Reuters) - Insurer Hartford Financial Services Group (HIG.N) warned on Monday that its third-quarter catastrophe losses would be substantially higher than a year earlier, mostly as a result of last month’s Hurricane Irene.   The Hartford, in a slide presentation for a Barclays Capital conference, said it expects pretax catastrophe losses for July and August of $150 million to $250 million, of which $75 million to $175 million comes from Irene.   A Hartford spokesman said Chief Executive Liam McGee told the Barclays conference the company was “well positioned” to handle the losses, which were within the scenarios it looked at for catastrophes.   In the third quarter of 2010, in which no hurricanes made landfall in the United States, the Hartford’s catastrophe losses were $13 million.   For most insurers, though, disaster losses this year have far exceeded expectations and historical comparison. Between Irene, devastating tornadoes in April and May, drought and a severe winter, many U.S. insurers have already lost well more in 2011 than they lost in 2010.   Worldwide, insurers lost more than $70 billion just in the first six months of the year due to natural disasters, reinsurer Swiss Re has said.   As those disasters work their way through the insurance industry, insurers have had some success raising rates on their customers after years of price weakness.   At the same Barclays conference on Monday, Travelers Companies Inc (TRV.N) said it was having success raising rates in the third quarter on business and personal lines. In business insurance in particular, the company saw a sharp increase through the end of August in premiums for policies that were being renewed.   Shares of the Hartford fell sharply at the open before rebounding, and were flat in late-morning trade. Shares of Travelers fell 0.7 percent. The sector was broadly lower, with 20 of the 22 companies in the S&P insurance index declining.  (Reporting by Ben Berkowitz, editing by Gerald E.

46,TRV,INSIGHT-Fed's new rate policy twists insurers into a knot," * Operation Twist seen depressing already low returns   * Insurers stuck with fixed payouts on policies, annuities   * Earnings could be pressured for years   By Ben Berkowitz   NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve’s latest move to stimulate credit for consumers and businesses, known as Operation Twist, is likely to threaten the earnings of some of the country’s largest insurers for years to come.   Wall Street in the past week has dimmed its view of MetLife (MET.N), Prudential Financial (PRU.N) and other big insurers, forecasting that they will have to cope with low rates and weak market returns through the end of 2011 and possibly well beyond.   The problem is that returns on insurers’ investment portfolios can’t keep pace with the obligations they have accumulated from torrid sales of annuities and life policies over the past few years.   “Ultimately I think it’s going to be a challenge to business models,” said Gregory Staples, co-head of U.S. fixed income portfolio management at Deutsche Insurance Asset Management (DBKGn.DE), the world’s largest asset manager for insurers.    Insurers were demonstrating sound financial management in purchasing long-term bonds with the premiums they collected to balance their long-term obligations. But if the Fed’s Operation Twist is successfully executed it will push long-term rates lower and, according to some experts, force insurers to retrench on product sales.   No one is suggesting Twist will put insurers out of business, but it is exacerbating a problem that they have been contending with since the financial crisis of 2008.   Under Operation Twist, as announced Wednesday, the Federal Reserve sell shorter-term notes to buy longer-dates Treasuries. That will have the effect of keeping longer-term interest rates down, which the Fed hopes will spur consumers to borrow and spend.   “Folks have brought the low interest-rate environment up to No. 1 priority,” said Doug French, managing principal of the insurance and actuarial advisory practice at Ernst & Young. “We’re not going to get any relief from interest rates for the next two to three years.”   The accounting firm has modeled the investment return needs of the 25 largest life insurers over the next three years to determine what will happen if rates remain static or fall further.   “Their general account yields (in aggregate) are going to decrease by about 51 basis points over the next three years, and that’s a cumulative effect,” French said. “The life industry is under spread compression. It’s just going to continue, and, in fact, it’s going to get worse.   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Graphic: stocks and yields    r.reuters.com/fup83s  Operation Twist coverage                  [ID:nS1E78J25W]   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   Annuities, a little understood but increasingly popular alternative for older Americans, are a paradoxical problem for insurers when rates plummet.   Limra, a marketing and research group for life insurers, estimates that 35 percent of U.S. retirees receive income from annuities. MetLife, the largest life insurer in the United States, reported that annuity sales rose 48 percent in this year’s second quarter.   Many of the products are sold with a guaranteed minimum benefit in return for an upfront payment. That means that regardless of the strength or weakness of the markets, the insurer has to write a check that doesn’t vary throughout the life of the product.   And that life is getting longer. Several insurers late last year warned that people were holding on to their annuities rather than cashing them out to invest in higher-return products. That creates a bigger nut for the insurers at a time when markets and the central bank aren’t cooperating.   “Once you get a little further out, there’s a very strong consensus that interest rates need to rise,” said JMP Securities analyst Matt Carletti. He and others said insurers are resigning themselves to anemic rates of return.   “Everybody expects a rise in interest rates but few expect it to happen any time soon,” Carletti said.   Rates on 10-year U.S. Treasuries prior to the Fed’s announcement were about 40 basis points below their previous 60-year low and almost two percentage points below their trailing five-year average, according to research from Oppenheimer.   Travelers Companies (TRV.N) said earlier this month that 10 percent of its long-term fixed income investments mature annually through 2014 at an approximate yield of 5 percent. If Travelers reinvests that in Treasuries, the yield is likely to be two to three percentage points lower.   The prospect of anemic returns may be one reason why insurance shares .GSPINSC have underperformed the broader market .GSPC in six of the last seven months.   Shares were broadly lower after the Fed’s announcement.   Several insurers that were hoping for moderate interest-rate relief by now may consider higher-risk investment alternatives eventually, though not yet.   Deutsche IAM said some insurance clients have been seeking to invest in bank loans and other alternatives to traditional stocks and bonds if they could find yields higher than 3 percent, though their appetite has cooled.   “With the recent volatility in the marketplace and the recent sell-off and concern about risk there’s been a bit of a pullback in the interest in those asset classes,” Deutsche’s Staples said.   Most everyone agrees that insurers can sustain themselves during a prolonged period of low rates and meet their obligations through their cash flow rather than investment returns. But the question is what happens if rates do not rise in a few years.   “Let’s say, hypothetically, you’re in a low interest rate environment for the next five to 10 years, you’d have to say you’ve got to change your product mix, you’ve got to change what you’re selling,” Ernst & Young’s French said.

Yet two weeks after the storm struck, only 6 percent of Northeastern homeowners had contacted their insurance company regarding that damage, the poll found.   The nationwide survey of 1,009 adults was conducted Sept. 12-15. The results are considered accurate to within 3 percentage points.   Irene, the first hurricane to make landfall in the United States in three years, struck the mid-Atlantic region and the Northeast part of the country Aug. 27 and 28. Estimates of insured damage from the storm vary widely, from $1.8 billion all the way up to $7.1 billion.   Yet there is broad agreement that Irene was much more of a flooding event than many hurricanes, where wind damage is often the major factor.   The Ipsos/Reuters poll found 10 percent of homeowners in the Northeastern states had water damage, while only 4 percent had wind damage.   While wind damage is usually standard in homeowners insurance policies, residential flood insurance is almost exclusively the province of the federal government’s National Flood Insurance Program.   That split can sometimes lead to confusion and delay people in filing claims. Besides the 6 percent who said they had already contacted their insurer, another 6 percent said they had not and were not sure they even would.   Whether they filed claims or not, though, the Ipsos/Reuters poll found people in the region generally thought better of insurance companies after the storm.   Some 29 percent of respondents in the Northeast had a “very” or “mainly” favorable opinion of homeowners insurance companies, up from 22 percent who felt that way in a poll a month earlier. The favorability data comes from Ipsos’ monthly “I-Rep Insurance Advisor” survey.   Nationwide, though, that sentiment remained flat from one survey to the other.

48,TRV,Mortgages at risk if U.S. flood program expires,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The federal program that insures homes against flood damage expires next Friday and is at risk of not being renewed, even as an early fall storm threatens to inundate much of the northeastern United States yet again.  Industry executives say that if the National Flood Insurance Program lapses, it would become all but impossible to get a mortgage in flood zones across the country until the program is revived.  Insurers and lobbyists are due to meet Friday to strategize on getting an extension passed by next week, though there is little optimism something would happen in time.  The NFIP has 5.57 million policies in force nationwide, insuring $1.25 trillion in property, which would remain in place even if the program is not extended.  Yet the program is also struggling with an unsustainable debt load. A bill to reform the NFIP overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives this summer, but a competing reform bill has made little headway in the Senate.  In the meantime, the program has continued on a series of annual extensions, the last of which expires September 30. A short-term extension is part of the broader government funding bill the House passed early Friday, but Democrats have said the bill has no chance in the Senate.  “I would have thought surely we wouldn’t be going down this path again,” said Patty Templeton-Jones, vice president of operations and principal NFIP coordinator at Fidelity National Indemnity Insurance Co., which is the largest writer of flood insurance policies in the United States. The NFIP uses private insurance companies to write and administer policies on its behalf, paying them a fee for the service.  “This is absolutely getting ridiculous,” she said. “We are at this point preparing for a lapse.”  In certain designated flood areas, flood insurance is mandatory as a condition of mortgages and other loans. According to informal guidance issued by the Federal Reserve in early 2010, during a lapse period lenders can still make loans on properties that are required to have flood insurance, even if that insurance is not available.  But Templeton-Jones said that is almost certain not to happen, notwithstanding the Fed’s permission.  “They won’t take the risk at all,” she said. “There may be some small ones that may be willing to do that but the vast majority won’t put themselves at risk like that.”  The debate comes as the northeastern United States, which is just now drying out and starting to recover from Hurricane Irene last month, prepares to be slammed again.  The National Weather Service said Friday that areas from North Carolina to Massachusetts were at risk of flooding this weekend, and AccuWeather reported that the storm was already dropping more than 2 inches of rain an hour in spots.

50,TRV,How to play it: What Buffett's buyback says to investors,"THE ISSUE: Warren Buffett launched a share buyback program at Berkshire Hathaway Inc for the first time in 40 years that poses the question of how best to deploy the cash a profitable company generates and how investors might respond.  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors and corporate management often are at odds over what to do with a company’s free cash flow — the money left over after all the bills are paid.  Management can do four things with free cash flow: acquire another business, reinvest in their company through capital expenditures, raise the dividend or buy back shares.  Companies that make up the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will end the third quarter this week with close to $1 trillion of cash on hand. About 350 of the 500 companies in the index typically conduct buybacks every quarter.  Investors and their advisers have similar choices on what to do with their money. Here are ideas from investing experts:  Buybacks garner a lot of attention because they often involve billions of dollars and can spark a good bump in a stock price. Shares of Berkshire Hathaway jumped 8 percent on Monday when the stock repurchase was disclose.  Anyone looking to invest in potential buybacks might consider Berkshire’s story. They could have waited four decades for that one-day pop. Or they could have bought $10,000 worth of Berkshire stock in 1962 that would be worth $80 million now.  “It’s not a viable investment strategy just to go for companies that could buy back stock, that’s a trading strategy,” said Paul Atkinson, head of North American equities at Aberdeen Asset Management Inc.  “What you’re looking to do is look for companies with a strong balance sheet and excess capital and ask the question ‘How do they intend to use it?’” he said.  Investors should not just look for cash bundles in corporate coffers, said Jim O’Shaughnessy, a well-known investor who runs O’Shaughnessy Asset Management in Stamford, Connecticut.  O’Shaughnessy favors large-cap stocks with a solid balance sheets, robust earnings and attractive valuations. “This combination of factors has historically outperformed the market,” said O’Shaughnessy, author of the best-seller “What Works on Wall Street.”  Stocks that meet this criteria and in which his firm has positions include Gap Inc, DirecTV Group and Travelers Companies Inc, O’Shaughnessy said.  To be sure, investors like dividends, Atkinson said, although many companies believe their shareholders prefer stock buybacks. Ultimately, he would like a company that puts their cash to the best use.  “We do not screen for stocks to identify potential buyback candidates,” O’Shaughnessy said. “Our research shows that cash-rich companies are not necessarily attractive investments historically.”  How to analyze and decide what to do with companies that hold large amounts of cash is widely discussed on Wall Street.  A prime example is Apple Inc, whose spare $75 billion has led to calls for a buyback or dividend.  “It’s hard to conceive how (it) could possibly spend that much cash in reinvesting in their own business,” said Robert McConnaughey, who helps oversee about $100 billion as head of equity at Columbia Management in Boston.  “You look back over history because bad decisions with capital or good decisions with capital make all the difference in the world,” McConnaughey said. Indeed, studies suggest, “corporations are terrible timers of buying back their stock.”  Dividends are longer-term commitments, he said. “The nature of a repeatable program, the reliability of that and what that says about management’s confidence in their own business is different than a one-time purchase.”  It’s a mistake to think of a company as an automated teller to tap for cash needs. Instead, investors should buying a company’s ideas and products — in short, its management.  “You have to be confident they will do the right things with that cash,” said Todd Bassion, a portfolio manager at Delaware Investments in Boston.  “Companies like Cisco are sitting on huge cash piles. But they’ve been criticized in the past for doing M&A and over-spending on the deals,” he said. Moreover, the cash is held abroad and returning it to U.S. holders would generate tax.  Dell Inc meets the strong balance sheet criteria and has a history of returning earnings to shareholders, Bassion said.  “If you get that formula, you have a pretty good recipe for success,” he said.  Dell has $16 billion in cash, only has $8 billion in debt and over the past 12 months has generated $5 billion in free cash flow, the size of a buyback program it announced two weeks ago. The stock also trades at just 8 times earnings, he said, so the can prudently carry out the buybacks.  Bassion cites CGI Group, the largest technology outsourcing and consulting company in Canada, as good model.  “Almost every deal they’ve done historically has been a good M&A deal. When they don’t find the M&A they give the cash back to you,” Bassion said.

53,TRV,St Paul's shelters UK's Wall Street protests,"LONDON (Reuters) - Seen from the River Thames, the dome of St Paul’s has been a constant in the ever-shifting London skyline, untouched by two world wars and three centuries of social and political change. Now the cathedral is becoming an unexpected focal point of debate over the future of capitalism. On Saturday, several hundred protesters occupied the steps and pitched tents outside the church as the “Occupy Wall Street” demonstrations spread via social media to London and worldwide. Almost swept from the area by police that night and the following morning, they were spared when cathedral authorities told officers to back off and allowed the protest to stay. Blocked from their original target - the stock exchange on the other side of Ludgate Hill - several hundred people have set up camp, promising to emulate their U.S. counterparts and stay for weeks, months, or even longer. By Monday lunchtime, a handful of officers in fluorescent jackets were simply looking on as tourists, students, and office workers on lunch breaks wandered through the encampment, many stopping to debate with protesters what the right way might be, if any, to move forward after the financial crisis. Many seemed surprisingly sympathetic. “I came down for a sandwich and got carried away,” said Tim Sanders, a chartered accountant working in the city, drawing a small crowd as he held forth in his navy suit on the need to restore balance and ethics to the financial system. “You’re seeing history right here, it’s going to sweep the world. These failing institutions are in the pockets of an elite. It’s morally corrupt. “ The protesters themselves appeared a disparate group, a range of veteran campaigners, leftists, environmentalists, students and job seekers. A large proportion said they were in employment and aiming to continue to work in between shifts at the encampment to stop it being cleared by police. One tent rota seen by Reuters included an engineer at Heathrow airport, a university biologist, a web designer and several other professionals. Some other protesters were recent graduates who had struggled to find jobs. Many of the initial organisers were foreign: German and Spanish in particular. Like many other protest movements this year, they appear almost completely leaderless, initially co-ordinated via social media platforms, inspired by events overseas and now making decisions through long, consensus-based meetings on issues from sanitation to their wider agenda. With their generally peaceful approach and hope of finding an ill-defined “better way” to manage international capital and politics, the largely educated crowd appeared in stark contrast to the tough, angry urban youth who brought chaos and looting to London and other cities in August riots. A church warden told the protesters the Corporation of London - the local government body that represents London’s financial district - was putting the greatest pressure on police to end the occupation. Late on Monday, a Corporation spokesman denied that was the case and said there were no plans to clear the demonstration “today or tomorrow”. But he said the protesters were wrong to try to scapegoat the City of London. “The banking sector is a major driver of growth and tax revenue in the UK and elsewhere,” he said. “The City has been a centre for trade, banking and now financial services for 2000 years and it is important it stays that way.” Reverend Rob Marshall, spokesman for St Paul’s, said the church had a long tradition of engaging with both the City of London’s businesses and its people and that while it welcomed peaceful protest it also needed to guarantee that worshippers and tourists could continue to visit. “On one hand, debate about the economy and financial structures is vital,” he said by telephone. “But practicalities are the concern today.” The Church of England was at the forefront of the campaign to write off debt in the developing world. It is also one of Britain’s largest landowners. Beneath the massive dome, built by Sir Christopher Wren from 1675 after the church’s destruction in the Great Fire of London, church services continued with prayers for those camping outside. Tourists and school groups visited untroubled. Don Court, a 22 year old politics student, said the decision of the church to allow the protesters to stay had proved the turning point and he had been amongst several protesters to attend services since. At one, Canon Giles Fraser told the congregation many of the world’s problems were caused by financial greed, Court said. “I’ve always thought of churches as conservative institutions, as protective of the status quo,” he told Reuters on the cathedral steps. “But I went in there yesterday and I saw a reverend of a huge cathedral essentially agreeing with what protesters are saying out here.” Much may depend on exactly who is deemed to own the land on which many of the tents stand. Currently, there is little clarity on where church land — were the protesters appear currently safe — begins and Corporation land starts. Around the corner, police riot vans stand ready. Signs and banners on tents made it clear those at St Paul’s viewed themselves as part of a much larger global protest movement. “Banks, IMF are global Mubarak,” said one, referring to ousted Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak. “The people are too big to fail,” said another. Holding repeated public meetings and listening to a range of speakers including academics, journalists, writers and on Saturday, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, the protesters said they were just beginning to decide on their demands, already producing an initial statement around key principles. Exactly what that might mean in terms of policy demands was far from clear, but long term campaigners for greater regulation and accountability in the financial sector say they believe that with events on Wall Street and elsewhere, the global debate is finally beginning to turn their way. With its reputation as a leading banking centre for the world’s richest, critics say London law firms and wealth managers have grown increasingly adept at attracting Russian oligarchs, Arab potentates and sometimes dubious clients. Members of the Mubarak and Gadaffi families both held expensive London properties through front companies registered in offshore tax havens such as Panama, believed to be only the tip of hidden investments. Inflows of foreign wealth have pushed up top end house prices and left many complaining of a widening and obvious income gap. John Christensen, former economic adviser to the government of Jersey and now head of the Tax Justice Network which works to close loopholes, said he had travelled to London to talk to the protesters about London’s status as what he calls the “world’s largest money launderer”. “These protests are hugely symbolically important,” he said. For most of the protesters, however, the target for their outrage remained the bailout of major banks by taxpayers. Even some staff at financial institutions happily told reporters and activists they believed populations were getting a rough deal. “I don’t think the public should be bailing out private institutions who are making billions, because it is not in the public interest,” said Joe Lungu, who identified himself as a consultant for Germany’s Commerzbank, “The public is being asked to clean up again and again and again.” Several others expressed similar views, a few bringing coffee to give to the protesters. Some banking staff wore casual clothes to work in the area on Monday, fearing attack. But the mood was peaceful. “Bankers welcome,” said one chalk pavement scrawl. Whether such sentiments will end up influencing policy in Britain is far from clear. Many passersby and even some veterans of earlier bouts of UK protest - including student demonstrations last year that failed to block tuition fee rises or wider austerity measures - are openly sceptical. “They are just a few hundred people,” said one senior investment banker, adding that after a miserable third quarter most of the sector were more worried about their jobs. The protests look to be attracting wider sympathy. “I think this is just going to get bigger and bigger,” said London taxi driver Robert Fenlon. “And that has to be a good thing.” For St Paul’s itself, with its gilted interior and tombs of soldiers, merchants and empire builders, its new role as a centre for dissent marks a radical departure. “St Paul’s has always been iconic,” said Cathy Ross, director of collections and learning at the Museum of London. “But it has always been very much an “establishment” church. For it to become a centre of protest is something very new — and interesting.” ",10182011,http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-protest/st-pauls-shelters-uks-wall-street-protests-idUSLNE79H02M20111018
54,TRV,UPDATE 5-Travelers says pricing strong; to boost buybacks,"* Q3 adjusted EPS 79 cents vs. Street view 87 cents * Pretax catastrophe losses $606 mln * Boosts asbestos reserves as costs rise * Stock hits 11-week high Oct 19 (Reuters) - Property insurer Travelers Cos  said it is getting stronger pricing across all insurance lines and will sharply increase share repurchases, driving its stock up as much as 7 percent. The pricing and buyback news overshadowed the company’s much lower third-quarter profit, hurt by Hurricane Irene and weak stock markets. Travelers shares rose as high as $55.07, their best level since the first week of August, leading all S&P; insurance shares . Barclays Capital, in a note to clients, said Travelers’ catastrophe losses were less than feared. The firm also flagged the increase in buybacks as a good sign and said Travelers was attractively priced at 0.84 times book value. Travelers, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average , reported a net profit of $333 million, or 79 cents per share, down from $1 billion, or $2.11 per share, a year earlier. Excluding investment gains and losses, it earned 79 cents per share. On that basis, analysts on average were expecting 87 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was the first time in more than two years that Travelers’ results were within 10 cents of the Wall Street consensus, either to the upside or downside, but only because estimates came down even further overnight. Travelers said pretax catastrophe losses were $606 million. In late August, Hurricane Irene became the first tropical cyclone to make a U.S. landfall in three years. Travelers’ investment results also suffered from weak stock and bond markets. Analysts expect most insurers to report weak third-quarter results because of the sharp decline in markets during the period. Travelers said it increased its asbestos reserves by $114 million after-tax in the quarter in light of higher litigation and settlement costs. A number of insurers have taken sharp asbestos reserve increases this year in the face of what they say is an increasingly aggressive legal community suing for decades-old exposure to the carcinogenic material. Travelers said it was able to increase prices across all of its lines of insurance. It is the third quarter in a row that the company has been able to renew business lines at higher prices. Travelers said it would buy back at least $1 billion in stock this quarter, nearly three times what it repurchased during the third quarter. Travelers shares were up $3.15 to $54.61 in afternoon trade.",10192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/travelers/update-5-travelers-says-pricing-strong-to-boost-buybacks-idUSN1E79H0RR20111019

Apple Inc’s revenue and profits came in below estimates for the first time in years as it sold far fewer iPhones than expected. The stock fell 3.7 percent to $406.58. Intel Corp climbed 3.9 percent to $24.31 after the chipmaker forecast quarterly revenue above expectations. Travelers Cos Inc advanced 5.3 percent to $54.18 and was the top boost to the Dow after it said it will ramp up a share buyback dramatically. The KBW insurance index  advanced 1.3 percent. “There still are good companies out there and a lot of these companies have pretty strong balance sheets with a lot of cash and they are going to endure this time of low consumer confidence that we are seeing,” said Casey Weade a certified financial planner at Howard Bailey Financial in  Fort Wayne, Indiana. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 47.95 points, or 0.41 percent, to 11,625.00. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 2.23 points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,227.61. The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 10.35 points, or 0.39 percent, to 2,647.08. Markets remained subject to violent swings on developments out of Europe. U.S. stocks surged in late trading on Tuesday after a report that France and Germany would pump up the euro zone rescue fund. Two senior European Union officials dismissed the report. “The market is trading on what is going on in Europe pretty rapidly ... even if they come out and say they have a solution, that may be positive for the markets in the short term. But we are still looking at something that is going to be difficult to live with. It’s not going to be all roses,” said Weade. The S&P; 500 has struggled to advance as it approaches the top end of a two-month trading range at around 1,250, having gained 8.6 percent for October. Black-clad demonstrators hurled stones and fire bombs at police in front of the Greek parliament as tens of thousands rallied during a nationwide general strike to coincide with a vote on painful new austerity measures. As earnings reports continued to roll out, Morgan Stanley said it swung to a quarterly profit as stock trading results proved unexpectedly resilient and wealth management revenue soared. The shares rose 2 percent to $17. Economic data showed U.S. consumer prices outside food and energy rose at their slowest pace in six months while groundbreaking on new homes rose at the fastest rate in 1-1/2 years.

58,TRV,"Travelers, its profits short of target, cuts bonus of CEO","(Reuters) - Travelers Companies Inc (TRV.N) cut Chief Executive Jay Fishman’s 2011 bonus by 28 percent because the insurer did not meet profit targets. Fishman received a cash bonus of $4.5 million, down from $6.25 million in 2010, according to a proxy filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. “The cash bonus amounts reflect the fact that the company did not achieve its 2011 target for unadjusted operating return on equity and operating income per share declined from 2010 levels,” Travelers said. Fishman’s overall pay, including a base salary, stock, options and other compensation, fell 17 percent to $16.5 million from $19.8 million. Last year was difficult for insurers as weak yields and high costs from natural disasters weighed on profits. Liam McGee, CEO of competitor The Hartford Financial Services Group Inc (HIG.N), declined a bonus for 2011 because of weak performance that led a top shareholder to push for a company split-up. Travelers’ profit fell to $1.43 billion last year from $3.22 billion in 2010, with operating return on equity dropping to 6.1 percent from 12.5 percent.

60,TRV,"Travelers smashes estimates, insurance rates rising","(Reuters) - Property insurer Travelers Cos Inc blew past Wall Street earnings estimates for the first quarter and raised its dividend 12 percent as natural disaster losses declined and insurance rates continued to rise after years of weakness. The company’s shares closed up 3.7 percent at $61.70 after touching their highest level since May 2011. Analysts said the results would be seen positively. “Incorporating the first-quarter results, our 2012 estimate is very likely to increase,” Larry Greenberg, an analyst at Janney Capital Markets unit Langen McAlenney, wrote in a note to clients. He said he was optimistic on property insurers and that Travelers was a preferred “buy” within that group. Travelers, a Dow component, said commercial insurance rates rose an average 8 percent in the quarter. On a conference call with analysts, the company indicated that strength has continued. “We feel good about what we’re seeing in the second quarter and ... feel the momentum is continuing,” Chief Operating Officer Brian MacLean said. Rates rose in other lines as well, including 4 percent in auto and 10 percent in homeowner policies. Chief Executive Jay Fishman, on the conference call, said Travelers was in some places raising deductibles and placing tighter terms on personal policies in order to improve profitability. The company has been among the most aggressive in the industry about raising rates in recent months, after a years-long period of excess capital forced companies to compete on price. Analysts have been watching closely to see whether Travelers could maintain the momentum, which bodes well for other insurers. Pretax catastrophe losses declined to $168 million in the first quarter from $186 million a year earlier. The year-earlier period was marked by severe winter weather in the United States and devastating earthquakes in the Asia-Pacific region. Travelers reported a first-quarter net profit of $806 million, or $2.02 per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $839 million, or $1.92 per share. Per-share earnings rose because of a decrease in share count. Net profit fell largely because of lower net investment income, and because of a one-time tax benefit last year that boosted underwriting results. The company also increased its reserve releases, to $200 million after tax from $155 million a year earlier. During the years of weak pricing, reserve releases were a major profit booster for insurers, though most analysts expect that well to start running dry soon. Operating earnings came in at $2.01 per share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S on average had expected $1.52. There was a broad range of estimates, and because Travelers does not give an outlook it is normal for its results to differ sharply from the Wall Street forecast. Even so, earnings were nearly 40 cents above the highest analyst estimate. The company raised its quarterly dividend by 5 cents, to 46 cents per share. It spent $350 million on share buybacks during the quarter. Allstate, the largest publicly traded home and auto insurer in the country, said its own catastrophe losses were $260 million in the latest quarter, mostly in March. JMP Securities raised its earnings estimates for the quarter, saying the losses were about 10 percent less than expected. After the market closed on Thursday, property insurer Chubb also easily beat estimates, reporting operating earnings of $1.70 per share compared with the analysts’ consensus of $1.52.

67,TRV,Travelers profit misses estimates on disaster losses,"(Reuters) - Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday as the insurer’s catastrophe losses fell from a year ago but were still higher than historical norms. Travelers executives said they believe the industry lost more than $10 billion on natural disasters in the April-June period, making it one of the worst quarters ever. Chief Executive Jay Fishman, on a call with analysts, said the company lost more in the quarter than it would normally lose in a full year not that long ago. To deal with the losses, Travelers said it is continuing to push for higher prices where it can and also tightening up on terms and conditions — for example, refusing to insure houses with roofs of a certain age. Travelers, a Dow Jones industrial average .DJI component, said commercial insurance pricing had risen more than 7 percent in the quarter. The company was one of the first in the industry to push and sustain price increases after years of weakness. Prices also rose in personal and professional lines, and retentions were steady. The industry endured one of its worst years ever in 2011, suffering record-breaking losses caused by tornadoes in the United States. This year has been somewhat more mild, and Travelers said its after-tax catastrophe losses fell to $357 million in the second quarter from $1.09 billion a year earlier. Still, the figure was “considerably higher” than the company would have expected. A number of Travelers’ peers have pre-announced significant disaster losses as well, among them Chubb Corp (CB.N) and Hartford Financial (HIG.N). On Thursday, shortly after Travelers’ report, Allstate (ALL.N) said its own pre-tax disaster losses in the quarter came to some $820 million. “Given recent earnings pre-announcements by others concerning heavy catastrophe losses, we believe the quarter will represent a sigh of relief” for Travelers, Larry Greenberg, an analyst at Janney Capital Markets unit Langen McAlenney, said in a note to clients. Travelers shares fell 53 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $63.47 in early trading. Travelers reported a second-quarter net profit of $499 million, or $1.26 per share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $364 million, or 88 cents per share. On an operating basis, Travelers earned $1.26 a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had on average expected $1.35. Because Travelers does not make forecasts, it is customary for the company’s earnings to differ substantially from Wall Street estimates. Over the prior eight quarters, according to Thomson Reuters data, the average difference - either positive or negative - between the company’s actual result and the mean estimate was almost 24 cents. Travelers reported an underwriting loss for the second quarter as the disaster losses overwhelmed another quarter of reserve releases. Insurance analysts have been closely watching reserves, amid suspicions that companies were close to running out of excess reserves to release. Net investment income was nearly flat as weakness in the bond portfolio was offset by other investments. Travelers said that given the weak interest rate environment and what it called “continuing unusual weather patterns,” it would keep pushing for rate increases and tighter terms on insurance policies, a strategy that has cost it some new business in recent quarters. Fishman also warned that while the company still has a goal to achieve return on equity in the mid-teens over time, those sorts of returns are unlikely in the current environment.

The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday in New York State Supreme Court, one week after the NFL sued three dozen insurance companies in an effort to force them to cover the costs of defending the claims. According to the Travelers lawsuit, the company provided liability coverage for NFL Properties, the league’s merchandising arm, but not the NFL and should not be required to pay for a joint defense. The insurer points out that a “master complaint” filed jointly by some 2,000 former players in June alleges 14 counts against the league, but only two against NFL Properties. “Travelers is not required to pay any defense costs of the NFL with respect to the underlying lawsuits,” Travelers said in its lawsuit. The insurance companies sued by the NFL and named as defendants in the Travelers lawsuit provided coverage to the NFL or one of its affiliates sometime between the 1960s and today. “Last week, the NFL filed a comprehensive lawsuit in California against 32 insurers to ensure an orderly and comprehensive determination of its insurance rights and its carriers’ obligations,” NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said. “This new filing by Travelers does not alter our objectives.” The NFL is facing a growing number of claims from former players who say football left them with debilitating brain injuries. Some of the lawsuits accuse the league of deliberately hiding known injury risks to profit from the game’s hard-hitting style, a charge the NFL has rejected. Several retired NFL players have committed suicide in recent years by shooting themselves in the chest, in some cases with the explicit goal of preserving their brains for study.

Travelers was able to increase rates in all business lines and also retain customers, a strong sign for the rest of the industry. The company has been a bellwether of insurers’ ability to raise pricing after years of weakness. Shares of Travelers rose as much as 4.6 percent to set an all-time high. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI component reported a third-quarter net profit of $867 million, or $2.21 per share, compared with $333 million, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding net realized investment gains and losses, Travelers earned $2.22 per share, a record operating profit for any quarter in the company’s history. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had expected $1.61. Because Travelers does not give forecasts, the company’s quarterly results often differ widely from analysts’ estimates. Still, the latest quarter brought the largest positive surprise in at least two years. Analysts said the results were strong across the board and pointed to further gains in coming quarters. “Even with a much higher-than-consensus estimate for 2013, we would expect our estimate to go higher,” analyst Larry Greenberg of Janney Capital Markets unit Langen McAlenney said in a note to clients. Travelers said catastrophe losses in the third quarter were $59 million after taxes, compared with $394 million a year earlier. The third quarter is historically a difficult one for property insurers, but relatively limited hurricane damage this year helped results. In a slide presentation for analysts, the company noted that customer retention in its homeowner and auto insurance businesses had been steady compared with the second quarter, even as the rate at which it raised premiums rose. The trends were similar in business insurance, where rates have been increasing steadily in recent quarters and retention has picked up after a dip late last year. Travelers also said it had taken a $108 million after-tax increase to its asbestos reserves, in line with past years. The company has some of the industry’s largest liabilities stemming from the cancer-causing mineral. The company’s shares were up 3.8 percent at $74.06 in morning trading after rising to nearly $74.70 earlier in the session. At Wednesday’s close, the stock was up about 21 percent for the year, roughly matching gains in the broader S&P; insurance index .GSPINSC.

81,TRV,Travelers shares touch life high after earnings beat,"(Reuters) - U.S. insurer Travelers Cos Inc’s (TRV.N) quarterly profit handily beat Wall Street expectations as it charged more for insurance coverage while holding on to its customers, sending its shares up as much as 5 percent to an all-time high. Travelers, a Dow Jones industrial average .DJI component, increased premiums across all its businesses and retained customers, in the fourth quarter, a strong signal for the insurance industry as it seeks to raise prices after years of weakness. Chief Executive Jay Fishman said the company’s business insurance and management liability businesses recorded rate increases of 8 percent with stable retentions in the quarter. “The underlying underwriting margins improved in each of our businesses, attributable to improved non-catastrophe weather-related losses and the significant pricing gains we have been realizing,” Fishman said in a statement. Shares of the company, which has a market valuation of about $29 billion, rose as much as 5 percent to touch an all-time high of $80.00 on Tuesday morning. The company’s sustained positive pricing momentum should also provide a positive read-through to other insurers, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Meyer Shields wrote in a note to clients. Even though net profit halved to $304 million, or 78 cents per share, due to losses from superstorm Sandy, the company was able to crush consensus estimates for the second successive quarter. Excluding net realized investment gains and losses, Travelers earned 72 cents per share. Analysts on average expected earnings of 14 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Travelers’ earnings often differ substantially from Wall Street consensus as the company does not give forecasts. “Given the continued low interest rate environment and uncertain weather patterns, we will continue to seek improved pricing,” CEO Fishman said in a statement. Net premiums written for the quarter rose 2 percent to $5.39 billion. Investment income was up 6 percent to $689 million, driven by alternative investment returns. Catastrophe losses in the quarter included an after-tax impact of $669 million from Sandy, slightly above the pre-announced losses of about $650 million. Sandy, which struck Northeast United States on October 29, is expected ultimately to be the second-costliest catastrophe in U.S. history, with insured loss estimates as high as $25 billion. The costliest catastrophe was Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Travelers shares, which have risen more than 6 percent since the start of the year, were trading up 3 percent at $78.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday afternoon.

84,TRV,"Travelers to continue with price hikes, shares touch life-high","(Reuters) - U.S. insurer Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) said it would look to raise rates across all its businesses to counter perennially low interest rates and uncertain weather conditions. Shares of Travelers rose to an all-time high of $88.57 on Tuesday morning, after the company posted a record quarterly operating profit that beat market estimates as catastrophe losses declined and the insurer was able to charge higher premiums. Travelers, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, was able to keep rates consistent across all its businesses and retain customers. The company has been a bellwether of insurers' ability to raise prices, after years of weakness in the market. Customer retention and the rate at which it raised premiums in its homeowner and auto insurance businesses were steady compared with previous quarters, Travelers said in a slide presentation for analysts. The increase in business insurance rates bodes well for peers such as Chubb Corp (CB.N), ACE Ltd ACE.N and WR Berkley Corp (WRB.N), UBS analyst Brian Meredith wrote in a note to clients. Chubb and ACE shares were trading up about 2 percent, while WR Berkley’s stock was up 1 percent in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. “At least over the next couple of quarters, I expect the rating momentum to keep up and to continue on the pace it has,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Charles Sebaski said. “I expect Travelers to be able to continue making these kinds of (pricing) improvements year-over-year.” Net profit rose 11 percent to $896 million, or $2.33 per share, in the first quarter, from $806 million, or $2.02 per share, a year earlier. On an operating basis, Travelers earned $2.31 per share. Analysts on average were expecting the company to earn $2.02 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Travelers’ results often differ from analysts’ average expectations as the company does not give a forecast. Analysts provided operating earnings estimates of between $1.77 per share and $2.28 per share for the company, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The insurer also raised its quarterly dividend to 50 cents per share from 46 cents per share. Pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, were $99 million in the quarter, down from $168 million in the year-earlier quarter. Net investment income, on a pre-tax basis, fell about 10 percent to $670 million, mainly due to low interest rates. Travelers shares, which have risen about 11 percent since the company last reported quarterly results, were trading up 3 percent at $86.68 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday afternoon.

89,TRV,Travelers to buy insurer from Canada's E-L Financial for $1.1 billion,"(Reuters) - U.S. insurer Travelers Co Inc (TRV.N) said it would buy Dominion of Canada General Insurance Co from E-L Financial Co Ltd (ELF.TO) for about $1.1 billion to boost its presence in Canada. Travelers’ shares were down marginally at $82.79 in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange. E-L Financial shares rose about 10 percent to C$649.99 - their highest in about six years - on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The deal will add Dominion’s commercial and personal insurance portfolios to Travelers’ business in Canada. It will help E-L Financial, which operates as an investment and insurance holding company, narrow its focus to life and health insurance, and mutual funds and annuity products that it sells through majority-owned Empire Life Insurance Co. The combined operations will be led by Dominion Chief Executive Brigid Murphy, Travelers said in a statement. Dominion was the biggest contributor to E-L Financial’s operating profit in the quarter ended March 31, accounting for more than a third of its operating profit. However, E-L’s operating income more than halved during the quarter as Dominion was hit by higher claims for automobile and weather-related property losses. The deal, expected to close in the fourth-quarter, will have no significant impact on Travelers’ 2013 earnings, but add slightly to 2014 profit. Travelers, which has a market capitalization of about 31 billion, said it would fund the transaction through debt or preferred stock financing or a combination of both. The company said it does not expect the transaction to have a big impact on its anticipated share repurchases for 2013 or 2014. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Gowling Lafleur Henderson LLP were legal advisers to Travelers.

92,TRV,Bubba Watson keeps share of lead at Travelers,"(Reuters) - Bubba Watson retained a share of the lead after the third round of the Travelers Championship on Saturday despite dropping three shots in the last six holes. The American, chasing his first PGA Tour win since he captured last year’s Masters, stumbled with bogeys at the 13th, 15th and 17th holes to finish with a round of even-par 70. Watson will go into the final round at 10-under par, tied for the lead with his countryman Charley Hoffman and Canadian Graham DeLaet, on a heavily congested leaderboard that included England’s newly-crowned U.S. Open champion Justin Rose. “I hit some shots today that were really good, some quality shots but got a couple bad breaks here and there but that’s golf,” Watson told reporters. “At the end of the day I still have a chance on Sunday and that’s what we are always looking for on the weeks we are playing.” Hoffman, who opened the tournament with a stunning 61 but fell back with a second round 73, carded a 66 while DeLaet signed for a 65, matching the best round of the day, as he chases his maiden PGA Tour win. American Chris Stroud (66) and Australian Nick O’Hern (68) were tied for fourth, just one shot off the lead, while American Ken Duke was alone in sixth after a 65. Justin Rose was among a bunch of players in the next group at minus seven, after he shot a second successive 68. At the end of the day, 18 players were within four strokes of the lead, setting the stage for a grandstand finish. Watson, who won his first PGA Tour title at the 2010 Travelers, came out fast with three birdies in his first six holes, before running into trouble in the stretch and getting distracted by spectators. “I’m sitting here with another chance to win,” Watson said. “It would be my fifth win and I never thought a guy from Bagdad Florida named Bubba would have a chance for five wins on tour. “The golf course sets up so well for me. I love the tee shots, there are a lot of cut shots, which I love to do off the tee. I got a lot of wedges and short irons here and I can make putts sometimes so it’s good.” Hoffman produced five birdies and a lone bogey to stay in contention 12 months after he blew his chance of winning the same tournament. He held the lead with two holes to play last year when he made a double bogey then a bogey to hand victory to Australia’s Marc Leishman, who remained in the hunt to defend his title after finishing Saturday’s third round at six-under. DeLaet, 31, had six birdies, including four in a row, and just one bogey. ",6222013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga/bubba-watson-keeps-share-of-lead-at-travelers-idUSBRE95L0H820130622
93,TRV,S&P; 500 dips and Dow gains on UTX; Apple up late,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P; 500 snapped a four-day winning streak on Tuesday and pulled back from Monday’s record closing high, while healthy earnings from United Technologies gave the Dow a slight lift. Earnings, as a whole, though, were lukewarm and held back the broader market. Technology shares weighed on the S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq. Shares of Apple (AAPL.O) fell 1.7 percent to end at $418.99, ahead of the company’s earnings after the closing bell. Apple’s stock added 3.6 percent in extended-hours trading on news that sales of the tech bellwether’s iPhone blew past Wall Street’s estimates in the third quarter, with U.S. shipments up 51 percent, even as profit fell. Initially, the stock was up 5 percent following the results. Stephen Massocca, managing director of Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco, called the iPhone results “very, very good” and said he expects Apple’s earnings to have a positive impact on stocks. “Certainly in the wake of Google (GOOG.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), it’s one of the big tech companies actually reporting better-than-expected numbers,” he said. During the regular session, the S&P; info tech index .SPLRCT slipped 0.5 percent to rank as the worst of the benchmark index’s 10 industrial sectors. Six of the 10 S&P; 500 industry sector indexes declined. Stronger-than-expected earnings from United Technologies (UTX.N), the world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners, drove the company’s stock to an all-time intraday high of $105.63. The stock rose 3 percent to end at $105.12 and led the Dow industrials’ advance after the company raised the low end of its 2013 earnings forecast. Biotech shares also pulled down the S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq. The S&P; biotech subindex .SPLRCTKBI fell 2.3 percent a day after hitting an all-time high. Stocks traded in a narrow range throughout the session. The benchmark S&P; 500 moved just 7.65 points between a record intraday high of 1,698.78 and a session low of 1,691.13. The Dow’s swing covered 60.16 points from its record intraday high of 15,604.22, reached within minutes after the opening bell, and its session low of 15,544.06. “The market doesn’t have justification to back off from the highs, but doesn’t have enough of a catalyst to move it significantly one way or another,” said Art Hogan, managing director of Lazard Capital Markets in New York. “There’s no one company reporting that tips over the cart.” The S&P; 500’s decline on Tuesday was only the second down day for the benchmark index in the last 14. The S&P; 500 has gained 18.7 percent so far this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 22.19 points, or 0.14 percent, to end at 15,567.74. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX fell 3.14 points, or 0.19 percent, to 1,692.39. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC dropped 21.11 points, or 0.59 percent, to close at 3,579.27. The Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) shares fell 3.8 percent to $82.21 after the company said it would cut jobs and reduce prices of auto insurance - steps investors viewed as an indication that rates had risen too far and competition was increasing. The company, a Dow component and the first major insurer to report results, is seen as a bellwether for the industry. Of the 130 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported earnings so far this season, 63.8 percent have beaten analysts’ expectations, but 51.5 percent have fallen short of revenue forecasts. Over the past four quarters, 67 percent of companies have beaten earnings estimates. Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) shares dropped 4.5 percent to $250.26 a day after the movies and TV streaming service reported it had gained new subscribers in the second quarter. The number of new subscribers, though, was not enough to impress investors. Elsewhere in the tech sector, Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) said it will buy software maker Sourcefire Inc FIRE.O for about $2.7 billion to increase its network security services. Sourcefire shares surged 27.8 percent to $75.49. In comparison, Cisco’s stock fell 0.6 percent to $25.56. Shares of Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP.N) surged 29.1 percent to close at $29.70 in their first day of trading. The initial public offering of 16.4 million shares was priced at $23 per share. The new publicly traded partnership has a contractual relationship with Phillips 66 (PSX.N), whose shares rose 2.6 percent to $59.49. About 5.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the daily average of about 6.4 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the New York Stock Exchange by a ratio of 17 to 13.

95,TRV,UPDATE 3-Travelers to cut auto insurance rates to battle competition,"* Second-quarter operating earnings per share $2.13 vs est $1.60 * Revenue rises 5 pct to $6.67 bln * Says will cut about 450 jobs * Shares down 4 pct   (Adds conference call details; updates stock move) By Aman Shah July 23 (Reuters) - Travelers Cos Inc said it would cut jobs and reduce prices of auto insurance, steps investors took as an indication that rates had risen too far and competition was increasing. The company’s shares fell 4 percent by midday and shares of other insurers also fell. “The concern is that Travelers was among the leaders pushing price increases, and now they are talking about lowering prices, so that has broader implications for the entire market,” Sandler O’Neill & Partners analyst Paul Newsome said. The company, a Dow Jones Industrial Average  component, is the first major insurer to report results and is seen as a bellwether for the industry. The broader Dow Jones Insurance Index, which includes Travelers and peers such as Chubb Corp and AIG , fell 3 percent. Travelers had previously been able to hold on to customers and keep insurance pricing consistent across its businesses to offset perennially low interest rates. But increasing competition has resulted in the company writing fewer policies, forcing it to resort to rate cuts. The personal auto insurance business reported a 7 percent fall in written premiums during the second quarter as the company’s strategy to increase prices hurt income from premiums. The business contributed about 14 percent to the total premiums written during the quarter. In a slide presentation for analysts, the company noted that the rate at which it raised premiums across businesses fell from that in the first quarter. “Travelers reported a deceleration in its Business Insurance pricing in 2Q13 compared to 1Q13. While still positive, the market is taking it as the sign that the property and casualty rate improvements may have peaked,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Charles Sebaski said in an email to Reuters. The company, however, said renewal rates at its business insurance unit were consistent with those in recent quarters. “Given the environment of low interest rates and volatile weather patterns, we will continue to seek higher margins,” Chief Executive Jay Fishman said in a statement. Travelers reported a strong second-quarter profit that blew past estimates for the fourth straight quarter, boosted by higher rates and lower claim payouts. The company’s operating earnings of $2.13 per share was well above the average analyst estimate of $1.60, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Travelers’ earnings often differ substantially from Wall Street consensus as the company does not give forecasts. Analysts’ estimates for the insurer’s per-share operating earnings ranged from $1.26 to $1.86 a share, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. “This appears to be a quality beat, not dependent on the favorable prior-period development,” BMO’s Sebaski said. The company said it would cut 450 jobs and take a related restructuring charge of about $16 million, of which $10 million would be incurred in the current quarter. The cost cutting will result in cumulative savings of $140 million by 2015, Chief Operating Officer Brian MacLean said on a conference call with analysts. The company’s combined ratio, the percentage of premium revenue an insurer has to pay out in claims, fell to 94.3 percent from 100.5 percent last year. A combined ratio under 100 indicates an underwriting profit. Travelers last month said it would pay about $1.1 billion to buy Dominion of Canada General Insurance Co to boost its presence in the Canadian market. Travelers shares were trading down 3.6 percent at $82.33 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Shares of Chubb and AIG were both down 2 percent. Allstate Corp fell 1 pct.

96,TRV,US STOCKS-Wall St to open slightly higher on earnings from Dow stocks,"* China signals support for growth, boosts global shares * Dow components Travelers, DuPont shares up following results * Apple due to report after the bell * UPS profit falls as global customers use cheaper shipping * Futures up: Dow 38 pts, S&P; 2.5 pts, Nasdaq 7 pts By Angela Moon NEW YORK, July 23 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set for a slightly higher open on Tuesday, helped by solid earnings from blue-chips DuPont and Travelers and by China’s efforts to avoid a hard landing for its slowing economy. With earnings season in full swing, Apple Inc is due to report after the closing bell. Apple shares were up 0.3 percent at $427.59 in premarket trade. U.S. insurer Travelers Cos Inc posted an 85 percent rise in quarterly profit, helped by lower disaster losses. The stock jumped 1.4 percent to $86.60 in premarket trade. Chemical maker DuPont Co, also a Dow component, said it was looking to sell or spin off its performance chemicals unit to insulate itself from flagging sales of paint pigments that have weighed on profits. The stock was up 4.2 percent at $59.55 in premarket trade. “We are seeing a couple of dynamics taking place right now, pushing the market to all-time highs. We have a strong start to the earnings season, the market likes round numbers and we happen to be just a short breath away from 1,700 (on the S&P; 500),” said Andre Bakhos, director of market analytics at Lek Securities in New York. “The stock market is seen as the only real game in town where you can catch returns.” S&P; 500 futures rose 2.5 points and were slightly above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures added 38 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures added 7 points. Among decliners, Netflix Inc shares fell 4 percent to $251.25 in premarket trade, a day after the online-entertainment firm reported that its show “Arrested Development” lured new subscribers in the second quarter but not enough to impress investors. United Parcel Service Inc posted a smaller quarterly profit as customers chose slower, cheaper shipping services, especially on international routes. The S&P; 500 closed at a third straight all-time high on Monday, with other major indexes also gaining, despite disappointing results from McDonald’s. The S&P; 500 is up 19 percent so far this year. China must deepen reforms to address a slew of challenges confronting it, President Xi Jinping said in comments published on Tuesday that emphasize the government’s determination to restructure the slowing economy. China shares listed in Hong Kong posted their biggest rise in nearly seven months on Tuesday.",7232013,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-usa-stocks/us-stocks-wall-st-to-open-slightly-higher-on-earnings-from-dow-stocks-idUSL1N0FT0HU20130723
97,TRV,Travelers profit handily beats estimates as disaster losses fall,"(Reuters) - U.S. insurer Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) posted an 85 percent rise in quarterly profit owing to lower disaster losses, blowing past Wall Street estimates. Shares of the company, a Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI component, rose 4 percent to $88.75 in premarket trading. Travelers reported net income of $925 million, or $2.41 per share, for the second quarter, up from $499 million, or $1.26 per share, a year earlier. Operating earnings of $2.13 per share were well above the $1.60 analysts had estimated. Profit was boosted by lower catastrophe losses, which fell to $340 million from $549 million. Revenue rose 5 percent to $6.67 billion. Analysts on average expected revenue of $5.97 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Travelers has been able to hold on to customers and keep insurance pricing consistent across its businesses to offset perennially low interest rates. “Given the environment of low interest rates and volatile weather patterns, we will continue to seek higher margins,” Chief Executive Jay Fishman said in a statement.

98,TRV,Fitch Rates Travelers' Senior Unsecured Debt Issuance 'A'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to The  Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TRV), $500 million 30-year senior unsecured  debt issuance.  KEY RATING DRIVERS TRV issued $500 million of senior unsecured debt to partially fund its  acquisition of The Dominion of Canada General Insurance Co. (The Dominion). TRV's ratings continue to benefit from its strong competitive position as a  top-five U.S. property/casualty insurer with a history of solid earnings across  several business segments and prudently structured balance sheet. Fitch  continues to monitor TRV's investment concentration in municipal bonds.    At the close of the second quarter 2013, Travelers had $2 billion in liquid  assets at the holding company and the debt-to-total capital ratio was 20.0%.   Pro forma debt-to-total capital as of June 30, 2013 would increase to 21.4%.  Earnings-based interest coverage for the first half of 2013 was 13.5x, and pro  forma interest coverage with the debt issuance is approximately 12x.  Both pro  forma financial leverage and interest coverage remain consistent with Fitch's  guidelines for the current rating category. The next significant debt maturity  is $400 million of senior debt in December 2015. Travelers' return on equity was 14.6% for the first half of 2013, up  significantly from 10.5% in the comparable period of 2012.  Improved  underwriting margins and lower catastrophe losses were responsible for the  period-to-period change.   Underwriting margins and lower catastrophe losses led to a consolidated GAAP  combined ratio of 91.4% through June 30, 2013, relative to 96.3% for the same  period in 2012.  Favorable reserve development helped the first half of 2013  combined ratio by 3.8 percentage points, while catastrophe losses added 3.9  percentage points to the combined ratio. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade include: --Capitalization at the underwriting subsidiaries that is inconsistent with  standards for the current rating category such as consolidated statutory net  leverage greater than 4.5x or a long-term increase in debt-to-total capital  ratio to greater than 25%; --A GAAP fixed-charge coverage ratio less than 8x on a run rate basis;  --A sustained period of net losses or catastrophe losses out of proportion with  the company's market share.  Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include:       --A substantially overcapitalized position relative to TRV's current rating  level. However, given publicly traded companies' sensitivity around managing  capital, this level of overcapitalization is unlikely;  -Sustained underwriting performance across business lines that is clearly better  than the industry and similarly-rated peers.

99,TRV,"Analysis: Merged American Airlines-US Airways would offer more, could charge more","(Reuters) - For travelers, the question of whether to let American Airlines and US Airways merge into the world’s largest carrier may boil down to this: pay more and get more, or pay less and get less. A new mega-airline, with the American brand name, would have more flights on more routes and could charge higher ticket prices on at least some. This would appeal to business travelers who generally favor convenience and comfort over price. If the airlines don’t merge, they might offer lower prices, but could ultimately be forced to cut routes or go out of business as they try to compete with much larger United and Delta, themselves the products of mega-mergers over the last few years. Business travelers, who spend two or three times as much as those flying for fun, are likely to lose out if the merger fails, since there would be no third alternative to the large domestic and international route networks offered by United and Delta. “If you’re a corporate traveler, you’re basically going to be faced with two stalwart airlines, Delta and United, and you’ll have actually less choice at the corporate level than you did if this merger would occur,” said Andrew Davis, an investment analyst with T. Rowe Price, which owns airline shares. The merger “certainly was not looked at from that perspective” by the government, Davis said. The U.S. Justice Department sued on Tuesday to block the $11 billion merger on antitrust grounds, arguing that allowing the fourth large U.S. airline merger in five years could lead to higher ticket prices and fewer choices for consumers. The merger “would likely substantially lessen competition and tend to create a monopoly,” the government complaint said. The airlines are girding for a court fight, saying their bid to create the world’s largest airline will provide a rival to challenge mega-airlines United and Delta, giving customers more choice. The American-US Airways LCC.N merger would cap a wave of consolidation that has helped return the industry to modest profitability after the 2008-09 economic downturn. Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) acquired Northwest in 2008, United Continental (UAL.N) was formed in 2010 and Southwest (LUV.N) bought rival AirTran in 2011. Southwest and other smaller airlines use a different business model, offering many direct domestic flights rather than hub-and-spoke connecting service. U.S. government data show that on an inflation-adjusted basis, average air fares are lower than they were 15 years ago but have moved up modestly since 2007, largely due to a more than 40 percent rise in fuel costs over the last six years. “This has not been skyway robbery,” George Hobica, president of AirfareWatchdog, an airfare alert and travel advice service, said of rising air fares. But airlines also have added charges for baggage, food and other services, making it more difficult to say whether travelers are better off over all. U.S. airlines as a group had a third straight year of profitability in 2012, but earnings have declined since 2010, according to data from the U.S. trade group Airlines for America. Industry margins have shrunk from 1.6 percent in 2010 to 0.2 percent last year, the data show. “Airlines are still making pitiful profits compared with other industries,” Hobica said. Continued expansion by carriers like JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines would be good for the market, he added. While he didn’t necessarily see huge consumer benefits if American and US Airways merged, he said the combination would benefit both carriers financially and ultimately make for happier passengers. “I think the benefit to consumers is that they’ll be flying in newer planes and we won’t see another bankruptcy,” Hobica said. Airline analysts and consultants said the DOJ complaint reflected government misunderstanding of how the industry operates and how it has changed. American Airlines, the No. 1 U.S. carrier before the spate of mergers, is now the third-biggest behind United and Delta. The Justice Department contended that American and US Airways, the fifth-largest U.S. carrier, have posted improved financial results and can survive as independent carriers. Robert Mann, an airline consultant in Port Washington, New York, responded that without the merger, American could ultimately be squeezed out of getting more business accounts. “You get corporate accounts chiefly because you have the best network,” Mann said. Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst at Hudson Crossing LLC, a consulting firm in San Francisco, said the government failed to consider upcoming changes in the competitive landscape. For example, Southwest will be able to launch new nonstop flights to New York, Los Angeles and other cities from its base of Dallas Love Field next year when the Wright Amendment, a federal law introduced in the 1970s, expires. The Justice Department also contended in its lawsuit that American and US Airways could survive as independent airlines. But industry analysts said customers of American and US Airways would suffer over the longer term as the airlines are unable to invest in new products and services at the same level as their merged peers. Delta, buoyed by its merger, has spent the last two years and billions of dollars upgrading plane seats, airport facilities and technology systems that have helped it run a more reliable operation. “The facts are that Delta, United and Southwest ... have now become so large and so financially strong that it is pure fantasy to suggest that either American and/or US Airways will be competitive as standalone airlines,” Robert Herbst, an independent airline consultant and former pilot, said in a report this week. For American parent AMR Corp, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2011, a blocked merger would also put its restructuring back at square one, requiring the carrier to come up with new strategies to grow and pay back creditors [ID:nL2N0GG10M]. Jan Brueckner, a professor of economics at the University of California-Irvine who studies airlines, took issue with the view that fares will go up under a merger. “Our work shows that legacy mergers don’t generate large fare effects,” Brueckner said. “The benefits of mergers - larger networks, greater ease in going places - probably dominate in determining the outcome.” Brueckner, an American Airlines frequent flyer, said he was excited that the American merger would offer new destinations. “I was looking forward to my airline being the world’s biggest and getting me to more places that I need to go, especially overseas,” he said.

100,TRV,Low rates push Travelers to raise premiums further,"(Reuters) - U.S. insurer Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) posted a record operating profit that blew past Wall Street estimates and said it expects to keep raising premiums to counter low interest rates and potential losses from natural disasters. Travelers, which also announced a $5 billion share buyback plan on Tuesday, has taken the lead in raising prices and has so far insulated itself from a fall in the number of policies. “We intend to stay the course on this strategy as our expectations of more volatile weather patterns and continued low interest rates have not changed,” Chief Executive Jay Fishman said in a statement. While the company’s net written premiums have remained nearly flat this year, its underwriting gains jumped 75 percent during the period. “This is a sign that most property and casualty (P&C;) insurers are going to have strong underwriting results for the quarter,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Charles Sebaski said. The company’s rivals in the P&C; insurance sector, including Chubb Corp (CB.N), AIG (AIG.N) and ACE Ltd ACE.N, are scheduled to post results in the coming fortnight. “Travelers has been for some time a leader in trying to implement price increases,” Sandler O’Neill & Partners analyst Paul Newsome said. “Though the company is not pushing a faster pace of rate increases, it appears to be trying to maintain pricing discipline within the industry,” he said. The company said it expects price increases in its renewal business to continue through 2014 as it looks to offset historically low interest rates that have squeezed income from its fixed income portfolio. But analysts said raising rates over the longer term would not be sustainable, given the industry’s cyclical nature. “I think we’ll likely start to see pricing slow in 2014,” Sanford C. Bernstein & Co analyst Josh Stirling said. The auto insurance industry is already showing signs that rates may have peaked. Travelers said in July it would cut jobs and reduce prices in the business. The company plans to introduce a new auto insurance product with a lower cost structure in about 15 states in the current quarter to tackle increasing competition. Shares of Travelers, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, were trading flat at $86.70. They have risen 21 percent this year. Travelers reported flat third-quarter net income of $864 million. On a per share basis, earnings increased to $2.30 from $2.21 per share a year earlier. The company reported operating earnings of $2.35 per share. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $2.05 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, rose to $99 million from $91 million a year earlier. The company’s combined ratio, the percentage of premium revenue an insurer has to pay out in claims, fell to 88.9 percent from 90.3 percent last year. A combined ratio of under 100 indicates an underwriting profit. Net investment income fell about 9 percent to $657 million, mainly due to low interest rates. Travelers said the $5 billion buyback authorization was in addition to the $759 million that remained from a previous repurchase plan.

Travelers, which also announced a $5 billion share buyback plan on Tuesday, took the lead in raising prices as the industry struggled with low interest rates that squeezed interest incomes. “We intend to stay the course on this strategy as our expectations of more volatile weather patterns and continued low interest rates have not changed,” Chief Executive Jay Fishman said in a statement. Travelers expects interest rates to remain at historically low levels at least until 2016, a company executive said on a post-earnings conference call. Shares of Travelers, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, were up 1 percent at $87.68 in early trading. They have risen 21 percent this year. Fishman said third-quarter results benefited mainly from rate increases and low weather-related losses. “We believe these are excellent results with Travelers continuing to show it can manage the pricing environment,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Charles Sebaski said in a client note.

104,TRV,Fitch Affirms Travelers' Ratings; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 16 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed its ratings on The  Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TRV), as follows:  --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'A';  --Subordinated notes at 'BBB+';  --Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) on insurance company subsidiaries at 'AA'.  See the full list of rating actions below. The Rating Outlooks are Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS TRV's ratings are supported by a strong competitive position as a top-5 U.S.  property/casualty insurer, solid earnings, prudent capital management, and  financial flexibility. Balanced against these strengths is TRV's continued  investment concentration in municipal bonds.    TRV's market position and size/scale are characterized as 'Large' by Fitch given  its nearly 5% market share of the property/casualty industry measured by net  written premium.  The company offers a wide range of insurance products to both  the commercial and personal lines markets and frequently occupies a top-tier  position among independent insurance agencies. TRV's combined ratio was 90.6% for the first three quarters of 2013, leading to  a 15.6% annualized return on stockholders' equity (ROE).  The combined ratio and  ROE averaged 95.3% and 12.5%, respectively, over the five-year period 2008-2012.  Profitability benefited from a benign catastrophe year in 2013 relative to 2012,  which included losses from Superstorm Sandy in the fourth quarter. Capitalization at the operating company level scored 'Very Strong' on Fitch's  proprietary capital model, Prism, which is considered consistent with TRV's 'AA'  IFS rating.  Other measures of capital strength such as operating leverage and  net leverage ratios were, respectively, 1.1x and 3.5x as of Sept. 30, 2013, and  are at median guidelines for the current rating category.  Fitch estimates TRV's  NAIC risk-based capital (RBC) to be 277% of the company action level at Sept.  30, 2013. TRV's debt-to-capital ratio was 21% at Sept. 30, 2013, which is within  management's stated target range of 15%-25%.  Operating EBIT covered fixed  charges by nearly 15x during the first nine months of 2013, which is at the  upper end of the range for Fitch's median guidelines for the current rating  category. The next significant debt maturity is $400 million of senior debt in  December 2015.   TRV repurchased 17 million common shares year-to-date Sept. 30, 2013. The  average price per share repurchased was $82 and the total amount spent on  repurchases was $1.4 billion, which represented slightly more than one-half of  net income over the period. TRV's board of directors authorized a $5 billion  share repurchase authorization at the close of the third quarter 2013.  TRV has maintained significant holding company liquidity with cash, short-term  invested assets and other readily marketable securities totaling $1.9 billion at  Sept. 30, 2013.  One year's interest expense and common dividends is estimated  to be $1.1 billion.  TRV's liquidity profile is supplemented by an $800 million  commercial paper (CP) program that is backed by a three-year $1 billion  syndicated credit facility. The company carries a large investment allocation in state, municipal and  revenue bonds, amounting to $36 billion or 58% of fixed-income securities as of  Sept. 30, 2013.  This asset class is experiencing a heightened level of stress  given the fiscal problems of many states and municipalities.  Concerns over the  municipal portfolio are largely mitigated by its diversification, high credit  quality and $1.6 billion unrealized gain as of Sept. 30, 2013. In addition,  greater than one-quarter of TRV's municipal bonds are 'prefunded', meaning there  is an escrow to fund repayment, significantly reducing credit risk.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade include: --Capitalization at the underwriting subsidiaries that is inconsistent with  standards for the current rating category such as consolidated statutory net  leverage greater than 4.5x, a long-term increase in the financial leverage ratio  to greater than 25% or a deterioration in the Prism score to below the 'Very  Strong' category. --A GAAP fixed-charge coverage ratio less than 8x on a run-rate basis;  --A sustained period of net losses or catastrophe losses out of proportion with  the company's market share.  Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include:       --Improvement in TRV's capitalization measured by a Prism score of 'Extremely  Strong'. However, given publicly traded companies' sensitivity around managing  capital, this level of overcapitalization is unlikely.  --Sustained underwriting performance across business lines that is clearly  better than the industry and similarly-rated peers.

Trading was volatile, with the S&P; fluctuating between positive and negative territory throughout the session, while the Dow moved between modest and solid losses and the Nasdaq swung between modest and strong gains. The S&P; materials index rose 0.6 percent as one of the best performing major S&P; indexes, led by a 6.6 percent gain in Dow Chemical to $45.93.

Energy stocks, another group with some correlation to the pace of economic growth, advanced 0.5 percent. “We still think economically-sensitive stocks have room to run... Those have the potential to be long-term winners,” said Jeff Mortimer, director of investment strategy for BNY Mellon Wealth Management in Boston. The Dow fell as Travelers Cos Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Johnson & Johnson - all bellwethers for their sectors - tumbled following results. Travelers fell 1.7 percent to $85 after posting a profit that beat expectations, though investors worried about the insurance provider’s margins. Verizon lost 1.3 percent to $47.70, while J&J; dropped 1.1 percent to $94.03 after it gave a forecast at the low end of analyst expectations. According to Thomson Reuters data, earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to grow 7 percent over the prior year. Of the 61 companies in the benchmark S&P; index that have reported so far, about 56 percent topped analyst expectations, below the long-term average of 63 percent.

108,TRV,Pricing pressure takes shine off Travelers' profit beat,"(Reuters) - U.S. insurer Travelers Cos Inc’s (TRV.N) slowing pace of price hikes raised concerns about its margins and overshadowed a three-fold rise in quarterly profit, sending its shares down as much as 3 percent. Travelers has been struggling with weakness in its personal lines business, which accounts for a third of the its insurance premiums and includes agency auto and homeowners policies. In a presentation on the company’s website, Travelers said the auto unit’s renewal rate change, or the estimated change in average premium charged on policies that renew, was 6.9 percent, its slowest in six quarters. In its core business insurance sector, renewal pricing dropped to 5.9 percent from 7.0 percent in the third quarter. The company, led by industry veteran Jay Fishman, has aggressively hiked insurance prices to offset uncertain weather conditions and low interest rates affecting its fixed-income investments. The fall in shares on Tuesday marked their biggest intra-day percentage decline in two years. Shares of peers Chubb Corp (CB.N), Hartford Financial (HIG.N) and American International Group (AIG.N) were trading down 1 percent. “I think investors are wondering about the avenues of margin expansion from here for 2014 and the stock’s premium valuation,” Macquarie Equities Research analyst Amit Kumar said in an email to Reuters. The company’s shares trade at 10.5 times forward earnings — an 18 percent premium to its historical 10-year average, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. As one of the first insurers to report results, Travelers is often seen as a bellwether for the insurance industry’s ability to raise rates. But increasing competition has resulted in the company writing fewer policies in the past few quarters, forcing it to cut rates, especially in auto insurance. Fewer catastrophes helped the company post a net underwriting gain of $435 million for the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $232 million a year earlier. After-tax catastrophe losses were $37 million, compared with $689 million a year earlier. Last year’s results were largely affected by losses from super storm Sandy that struck Northeast United States. The company’s net income rose to $988 million, or $2.70 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, from $304 million, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier. Operating earnings were $2.68 per share, significantly beating the average analyst estimate of $2.16 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Travelers’ earnings often differ substantially from analysts’ average estimate as the company does not give forecasts. The company’s $1 billion deal to buy Dominion General Insurance, which closed on November 1, helped boost written premiums by 5 percent in the fourth quarter. Combined ratio, the percentage of premium revenue an insurer has to pay out in claims, fell to 87.7 percent in the quarter from 105.4 percent. A combined ratio of under 100 indicates an underwriting profit.

110,TRV,US STOCKS-Wall St inches up after two-day dip; materials climb,"* Dow Chemical jumps on Third Point stake * Verizon, Travelers, JNJ fall after results * 70 S&P; 500 companies to report earnings this week * Indexes: Dow off 0.30 pct, S&P; up 0.14 pct, Nasdaq up 0.31 pct By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged higher on Tuesday, putting the S&P; on pace to snap a two-session decline, as gains in the materials sector were offset by declines in a trio of Dow components. The S&P; materials index gained 0.9 percent as the  best performing of the 10 major S&P; indexes, led by a 4.9 percent gain in Dow Chemical to $45.18. Activist investor and hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb has taken a stake in the company and wants it to spin off its petrochemical arm. “Dow Chemical is kind of behind sort of a broader market rise with the idea there is still value, or at least one respected hedge fund thinks there is still some value in a specific stock,” said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. Also adding support to the materials sector was Alcoa Inc , which advanced 4.8 percent to $11.90 after JP Morgan upgraded the stock to an “overweight” from a neutral” rating and boosted its price target to $15 from $9 per share. But three Dow components fell after reporting earnings, giving back advances made before the opening bell. Travelers Cos Inc lost 2 percent to $84.75 after the insurance provider posted a more than three-fold rise in fourth-quarter profit. Fellow Dow components Verizon Communications Inc fell 1.6 percent to $47.58 and Johnson & Johnson lost 2.2 percent to $92.97 as the biggest drag on the S&P; 500. “There is some legitimate concern for investors that good news is factored into existing prices. In terms of earnings, this has been a market of ‘sell on the news,’ because the stocks have run so far, so you really have to surprise on the upside to maintain gains in some of these stocks,” said Meckler. Verizon said its quarterly revenue rose 3.4 percent, slightly ahead of Wall Street estimates as it added more subscribers than expected at its Verizon Wireless venture with Vodafone Group Plc. JNJ reported quarterly results that came in above Wall Street estimates on sharply higher sales of its prescription drugs and improving sales of its medical devices. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 49.25 points or 0.3 percent, to 16,409.31, the S&P; 500 gained 2.49 points or 0.14 percent, to 1,841.19 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 13.006 points or 0.31 percent, to 4,210.588. IBM is set to report after the closing bell. For the week, 70 S&P; 500 companies are scheduled to report. According to Thomson Reuters data through Friday, earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to grow 7 percent over the prior year. Of the 45 companies in the benchmark S&P; index that have reported, 49 percent topped analyst expectations, below both the long-term average of 63 percent and the 66 percent average over the past four quarters. As the Federal Reserve has embarked on its plan to reduce economic stimulus, investors will closely monitor corporate profits for signs of growth. About eight companies have issued negative outlooks for every positive one, which would mark the lowest ratio on record should it continue. Forest Laboratories Inc gained 1.3 percent to $69.61, pulling back after hitting $71.84, its highest level in almost ten years.

McDonald’s Corp  reported earnings that fell alongside a drop in U.S. same-store sales, though the Dow component rose 0.9 percent to $100.60 before the bell. * Dozens of S&P; 500 components are slated to report this week. Of the 87 that had reported thus far, 62.1 percent have topped earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, compared with the 66 percent average over the past four quarters. On revenue, 51.7 percent have exceeded forecasts, below the 54 percent average over the past four quarters. * S&P; 500 companies’ first-quarter earnings are projected to have increased 0.8 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The forecast is down sharply from the start of the year, when profit growth was estimated at 6.5 percent. * S&P; 500 futures rose 0.7 point and were slightly under fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures added 6 points and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 2.25 points. * European shares were sharply higher on the day, rising 1.1 percent on the back of deal activity in the pharmaceutical space, including Novartis both swapping assets with GlaxoSmithKline and selling a unit to Eli Lilly & Co. U.S. shares of Glaxo rose 4 percent to $55.23 in premarket trading. * In company news, Allergan Inc jumped 17.5 percent to $166.75 in premarket trading a day after activist investor William Ackman teamed up with Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc to make a joint bid for the company. * General Motors Co filed a motion in a U.S. bankruptcy court to enforce a bar on lawsuits related to ignition defects in cars sold before its 2009 bankruptcy as it fights a class action lawsuit that seeks to set aside the restriction.

115,TRV,Travelers' profit rises 17 percent on higher investment income,"(Reuters) - U.S. property and casualty insurer Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) reported a 17 percent rise in first-quarter profit, helped by higher underwriting gains and an increase in net investment income. Net income rose to $1.05 billion, or $2.95 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, from $896 million, or $2.33 per share, a year earlier. Net investment income rose about 10 percent to $736 million as Travelers benefited from strong returns in its non-fixed income portfolio. Underwriting gains jumped about 32 percent to $791 million. Net written premiums rose about 5 percent to $5.87 billion, while total revenue rose 6 percent to $6.71 billion. “Our very deep agent, broker and customer relationships, highly segmented pricing strategies and expense discipline continued to deliver strong and improving underwriting results,” Chief Executive Jay Fishman said in a statement. On an operating basis, Travelers, which is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index .DJI, earned $2.95 per share. Analysts on average were expecting the company to earn $2.16 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Travelers’ results often differ from analysts’ average expectations as the company does not give a forecast. Pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, rose about 50 percent to $149 million. Travelers’ combined ratio, the percentage of premium revenue an insurer has to pay out in claims, fell to 88.2 percent in the quarter from 90.8 percent. A combined ratio of under 100 indicates an underwriting profit. Travelers had a market value of about $30 billion based on Monday’s close of $86.40 on the New York Stock Exchange. The company's shares have fallen by about 3.3 percent since the start of the year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index .DJI has changed little during the same period.

118,TRV,UPDATE 2-Travelers ordered to pay over $500 mln in asbestos case,"(Adds Travelers, lawyer’s comments) By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court ordered Travelers Cos Inc to pay more than $500 million to thousands of asbestos victims in a case stemming from the insurer’s coverage of Johns-Manville Corp, an insulation maker that spent six years in bankruptcy during the 1980s. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York reversed a February 2012 ruling in which U.S. District Judge John Koeltl said conditions under three settlement agreements in 2004 that required Travelers to make the payment had not been satisfied. Writing for a three-judge appeals court panel on Tuesday, Circuit Judge Ralph Winter said Koeltl’s interpretation “could not reasonably have been intended by the parties, whatever Travelers’ private hopes and dreams, and is not supported by the language of the agreements.” The 2nd Circuit ordered the reinstatement of a 2011 ruling by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland, who oversaw Johns-Manville’s bankruptcy, that Travelers make payments required under the 2004 agreements, plus $65 million of interest. Koeltl had reversed that ruling. Lifland died in January. Patrick Linehan, a Travelers spokesman, said the insurer is reviewing Tuesday’s decision, and has set aside reserves to cover the entire payout, apart from interest payments. Many companies had stopped using asbestos for fireproofing and insulation by the mid-1970s after it was linked to cancer and other diseases. Litigation persists because the effects of exposure can take decades to surface. Now owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc , Johns-Manville had from the 1920s to 1970s been the largest U.S. maker of products containing asbestos. It filed for bankruptcy protection in 1982 under the weight of asbestos litigation, and settled various claims in 1986. Johns-Manville emerged from Chapter 11 in 1988. The 2nd Circuit rejected Travelers’ contention that it need not pay claimants in light of a June 2009 U.S. Supreme Court decision that limited claims against the insurer, and a separate decision by the 2nd Circuit the following March. It also said Travelers had waived potential objections to the payment. “Obviously, we’re gratified,” said Ronald Barliant, a partner at Goldberg Kohn in Chicago who represents about 1,600 claimants. “Payments should have been made five years ago.” Sander Esserman, a partner at Stutzman, Bromberg, Esserman & Plifka in Dallas representing other claimants, said he looks forward to Travelers “paying the thousands of plaintiffs who are owed money.” Paul Clement, a partner at Bancroft PLLC who represents other claimants, was not immediately available for comment. The 2nd Circuit heard oral arguments in January 2013. Separately, Travelers on Tuesday posted a larger-than-expected 26 percent drop in second-quarter profit, as hail and windstorms boosted catastrophe-related losses.  Its shares fell as much as 5.1 percent by early afternoon. The case is Common Law Settlement Counsel et al v. Travelers Indemnity Co et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 12-1094, 12-1140 and 12-1205.

119,TRV,Travelers' profit drop reflects slowdown in rate increase,"(Reuters) - Property and casualty insurer Travelers Cos Inc reported a steeper-than-expected fall in quarterly operating profit, hurt by bigger catastrophe losses and a slowing pace of premium rate increases. The company, led by industry veteran Jay Fishman, has aggressively raised insurance prices in the past several quarters to offset low interest rates affecting its fixed-income investments.      However, the industry’s ability to raise premiums is slowing after several quarters of steady rate increases, analysts said.  “We haven’t witnessed large catastrophe losses which would deplete the industry capital position and necessitate large rate increases,” Macquarie Securities analyst Amit Kumar said.  Travelers’ shares were down 4.1 percent at $91.37 in afternoon trading on Tuesday, making it the top loser on Dow Jones Industrial Average. Up to Monday’s close, the stock had risen 10.75 percent since it last reported results in April. But Fishman did not rule out the possibility of premium rate increases in certain businesses. “There remains opportunity to further improve the product portfolio... by achieving additional rate increases for those accounts that continue to experience unusual weather volatility,” Fishman said in a statement. Separately, a federal appeals court on Tuesday ruled Travelers should pay more than $500 million to satisfy asbestos-related claims stemming from its coverage of policyholder Johns-Manville Corp, reversing a lower court ruling. Travelers’ catastrophe losses in the latest quarter rose to $436 million from $340 million a year earlier. Severe storms pounded parts of the central United States in early June, producing baseball-sized hail. There were also  several tornado touchdowns and other dangerous wind storms.

While DuPont is expected to report lower first-quarter results, Travelers Companies Inc’s first-quarter results are expected to be in line with estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will keep an eye out for details on Verizon’s upcoming mobile video service and capital expenditure range and will look for updates on AT&T;’s proposed $48.5 billion deal to buy DirectTV, which is under regulatory review. Boeing faces fears of an aircraft downturn after it booked record orders in 2014, while Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s new CEO, is charged with reviving the company’s falling sales and managing negative PR around the healthiness of its food. Investors will be watching the impact of the strong dollar on 3M’s first-quarter results and Microsoft is expected to report sharply lower profit for its third quarter as sales of personal computers remain soggy. Search engine giant Google Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts’ estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Google, which has been officially charged of cheating consumers and competitors by the European Union, is also being investigated for its Android mobile operating system. Analysts say the latter could prove a bigger threat to Google’s future profitability. Analysts expect foreign exchange to negatively impact revenues in the first quarter even as paid click growth is poised to decelerate again. Facebook Inc is expected to post a first-quarter profit above Wall Street’s expectations on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The world’s largest social network’s business has been booming thanks to its mobile ads on smartphones and tablets. Many investors also expect that video ads will provide the company’s next leg of growth. Facebook has also been stepping up efforts to expand products like messaging service WhatsApp and photo-sharing service Instagram. Investors will be looking out for the company’s outlook for the remainder of 2015. On Thursday, the e-commerce company Amazon.com Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue largely in line with analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. However, analysts are expecting margins to improve as the company gets a grip on a slew of investments on everything from Hollywood-style television productions to cloud computing and consumer devices. On Tuesday, Yahoo Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts’ estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, as its overall share of U.S. desktop searches declines. Analysts and investors will be looking out for any details on the tax-free sale of its Alibaba shares. General Motors Co reports first-quarter results before the market opens on Thursday. Analysts are expecting 96 cents per share, up sharply from a year before. On Wednesday, chipmaker Qualcomm Inc is likely to report second-quarter revenue and profit broadly in line with analysts’ average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Qualcomm lowered its outlook for fiscal 2015 in January, saying it did not expect its newest Snapdragon mobile chip to be used in a major customer’s flagship smartphone. Samsung opted for its own mobile processor and modem chip in the Galaxy S6 instead of equivalents from Qualcomm. The chipmaker had also warned that “challenges” with another of its chips had hurt its competitiveness in China. Qualcomm recently came under pressure from hedge fund Jana Partners to spin off its chip business from its patent-licensing business. Credit Suisse reports earnings for the first three months of 2015 on Tuesday. Meanwhile, on Friday the Swiss bank will ask shareholders to sign off in a symbolic vote on executive pay for 2014, when Credit Suisse became the largest bank in decades to plead guilty to a U.S. criminal charge and will pay more than $2.5 billion in penalties for helping Americans evade taxes. Investors will focus on existing home sales on Wednesday, which is expected to have increased 3.0 percent to an annual rate of 5.05 million units. Also, data for new home sales is expected to be released on Thursday. On Friday, the U.S. Commerce Department releases data for durable goods. Starbucks Corp reports its second-quarter results on Thursday. Starbucks is one of the restaurant industry’s top performers, but investors and analysts worry that its streak of red-hot growth is coming to an end. The company has a variety of plans in place to boost sales (adding booze, smoothies, more lunch and dinner options, improving and expanding tea selections and testing delivery) and investors will be looking for proof that those are working. On Tuesday, Yum Brands Inc will report its first-quarter results. Yum’s China business remains in the spotlight as it fights to recover from the latest food scandal in its biggest market. Analysts say the company is suffering from “brand fatigue” in China, where competition is mounting and its image has been hurt by food scares that have raised doubts over its supply chain. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc is slated to announce results for the first quarter on Tuesday. Chipotle is still having problems finding pork suppliers to replace the one it suspended for running afoul of its animal welfare rules. The company says customers have simply switched to other meats and that it isn’t losing sales - but investors will be on alert for any signs of a slowdown. Drugmaker Biogen Inc is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Friday, driven by strong sales of its top-selling oral MS drug, Tecfidera, which has seen burgeoning sales since its launch in 2013. Biogen, which leads the United States multiple sclerosis market with five drugs for the condition, recently reported promising data for its Alzheimer’s drug. Investors will also be looking for commentary on Tecfider’s growth expectations, and potential for competition, as well as the longer-acting MS injectable Plegridy. AbbVie Inc, whose planned $21 billion acquisition of Pharmacyclics Inc is meant to lessen the company’s dependence on its blockbuster Humira arthritis drug, is expected to report sharply higher earnings and sales for the first quarter on Thursday, fueled by Humira’s continuing growth and sales of the company’s recently approved Viekira Pak treatment for hepatitis C. Investors will be keen for details on sales prospects for Viekira Pak, given steep price discounts AbbVie has given to compete with Gilead Science Inc’s potent treatments for the liver disease. Eli Lilly and Co is expected to report higher first-quarter earnings on Thursday as the Indianapolis drugmaker begins to recover from patent expirations that slashed demand for its biggest products. The company is well positioned to deliver a promised return to profit growth this year, helped by new treatments for cancer and diabetes and growing sales of its animal health brands. Abbott Laboratories will report its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Recovering sales of Abbott Laboratories’ infant formulas, following costly recalls in Asia, and improving performance of the company’s branded generic medicines, are expected to drive quarterly earnings growth despite the negative impact of the stronger dollar. Ebay Inc is expected to report results for the first quarter largely in line with Wall Street expectations on Wednesday. The company has seen strong growth in payments business as well as its non-auction e-commerce business. Analysts expect that the company will continue to benefit from the rise in demand for mobile devices, as consumers increasingly use their smart phones and tablets to shop online. Investors will look for details on the company’s plans for the spinoff of PayPal scheduled for the second half of 2015. On Thursday, Dow Chemical Co is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit due to a stronger dollar and a slowdown in its agricultural business. The company last month said it would offload a bulk of its low-margin bleach and vinyl-related business to Olin in a $5 billion. Investors will be looking for further comments on the company’s cost-saving plans. Johnson Controls Inc, the auto parts supplier and maker of climate control systems for buildings, is expected to report higher second-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by higher sales in its seating and interiors business as auto sales and production rose in the first quarter. The company’s buildings efficiency business, which provides air conditioning equipment and building management services, is also expected to report higher revenue as U.S. office vacancy rate declined to its lowest level since the third quarter to 2009. Investors will be looking for comments on Johnson Controls’ business focus and outlook following the sale of its workplace solutions business to CBRE Group. Pentagon’s No. 1 arms supplier, Lockheed Martin Corp, reports first-quarter results on Tuesday. Lockheed Martin has been focusing on increasing sales to commercial customers in United States as well as international governments to make up for pressures from tight U.S. defense spending. Lockheed gets 17 percent of its revenue from international markets and 1 percent from U.S. commercial customers. Investors will be looking to see if Lockheed still expects U.S. military spending to meaningfully pick up this year. Weapons maker Raytheon Co has increased exposure to international markets, which account for about 27 percent of its total sales, as U.S. defense spending remains tight. The maker of the Tomahawk missile and the Patriot missile defense system forecast disappointing 2015 revenue in January as domestic orders remained weak. When the company will report its first-quarter results on Thursday, investors will be looking for an update on a $2 billion order for the Patriot missile defense system that Raytheon expected to win in the first quarter. On Tuesday, Omnicom Group Inc, the No. 1 U.S. advertising company, is expected to report first-quarter results largely in-line with analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Omnicom had warned that a strong dollar would hit revenue this year. Omnicom, whose clients include Apple, McDonald’s and Adidas, gets a little less than half of its revenue from outside the United States. On Friday, Interpublic Group of Companies Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts’ average estimate according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company’s previous quarter was helped by higher ad spending by businesses in the United States. On Tuesday, chipmaker Broadcom Corp is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts’ estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts expect the company’s connectivity business to sequentially decline as it comes off a strong Apple-driven fourth quarter. Analysts will be looking for the company to provide outlook for the quarter ending June. On Wednesday, data storage company EMC Corp is expected to report first-quarter profit and revenue below analysts’ estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company had in January forecast a lower-than-expected profit for 2015 and said it would cut jobs. The company, which earns nearly half of its revenue from international markets, is expected to be hurt by a strong dollar. Analysts say enterprise storage demand has been mixed in quarter which may hurt EMC. Virtualization software maker VMware Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts’ estimate on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, hurt by a stronger dollar. More than 48 percent of VMware’s revenue comes from outside the United States. Analysts at Wells Fargo estimate a negative impact of 3-4 percent from foreign currency on license revenue growth. Programmable chip maker Xilinx Inc will report fourth-quarter results after markets close on Wednesday. The company, which dominates the programmable chip market along with Altera Corp, is expected to report profit and revenue that are largely in line with analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will look for updates on sales to the broadcast, consumer and automotive end market and sales to communications and data center customers. PulteGroup Inc’s first-quarter results are expected to be released on Thursday. Coming on the heels of larger peer D.R. Horton’s second-quarter results on Wednesday, PulteGroup’s results are expected to provide further evidence of a strong spring selling season this year, suggesting that a slowdown in housing starts in the first three months did not point to underlying weakness in the U.S. housing market. Steelmaker Nucor Corp will report first-quarter results on Thursday. Nucor has been struggling with lower selling prices due to high levels of imports. Declining oil prices have also led to excess inventory in Nucor’s pipe and tube business. Analysts will be looking for comments on inventory, steel demand and overcapacity in its steel mills business. On Thursday, Patterson-UTI Energy Inc, the second-largest land driller in North America, is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit as weak oil prices weigh on drilling activity. Patterson, which halved its rig construction program for this year, had warned that 2015 would be “challenging,” having received indications that customers could terminate a number of longer-term contracts early. Investors will be looking for updates on further cost saving measures and commentary on contracts and dayrates for its 16 new high-tech Apex rigs, which analysts believe could help the driller boost cash margins this year. Contract driller Nabors Industries Ltd, which is merging with C&J; Energy, is expected to report on Tuesday a lower profit in the first quarter as drilling activity continues to be hurt by the fall in oil prices. The company has already warned of weak activity and pricing pressure in its international operations. Investors will be looking for updates on any job cuts and the company’s plans to idle rigs in an oversupplied market. On Tuesday, coal miner Arch Coal Inc is expected to report a ninth straight quarterly loss and on Thursday, coal miner Peabody Energy Corp is expected to report a wider first-quarter loss due to continued weakness in coal prices. Kimberly-Clark Corp, the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, is expected to report better-than-expected first-quarter sales, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, helped by growing demand in emerging markets such as Brazil, China and South Africa. However, higher input costs and a stronger dollar could have hurt profit. The company said in February it would transfer pension obligations to two insurers to reduce risk and will take a charge in the second quarter. It had also warned of an 8-9 percent drop in 2015 sales hurt by the dollar and weak demand for core products such as Huggies diapers. Investors will be looking for any updates on forecast on Tuesday. Hershey Co, the maker of Hershey’s Kisses and Reese’s peanut butter cups, has been struggling with high cocoa and dairy costs and intense competition from rivals such as Mondelez and Mars. To tackle growing competition, the company has been pouring money in advertisements and promotions, but this is expected to hurt its full-year earnings per share by 2 percentage points. It has also tried to diversify and add a new stream of revenue by acquiring jerky maker Krave Pure Foods Inc in January, marking its first foray into meat snacks. When the company will report its first-quarter profit on Thursday, investors will be looking out for comments on whether the company will make more acquisitions in the meat and bakery snacks category, which are becoming more popular than candy, and the effect of the strong dollar on its outlook. Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc will report its first-quarter results on Thursday. Investors will be looking at how much Boston’s record snowfall hurt results at Dunkin Brands, whose Dunkin’ Donuts shops are concentrated in the U.S. northeast. Experts say the impact could be meaningful. Under Armour Inc, a sports apparel and footwear maker, is expected to report profit and sales for the first quarter in line with analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts expect Under Armour to continue its 19-quarter streak of reporting more than 20 percent growth in revenue, helped by expanded offerings in sport and outdoor clothing, strong demand for its Speedform Apollo running shoes, new launches in basketball footwear and sponsorship deals. The company is also expected to benefit from investments in its fast-growing digital platform and from the acquisitions of fitness tracking apps Endomondo and MyFitnessPal. When the company will report on Tuesday, investors will look for an update to the full-year forecast and color on the performance of new launches in footwear. Hanesbrands Inc, the innerwear and apparel maker is expected to report first-quarter profit and sales above analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts are projecting first-quarter sales growth of more than 15 percent as the company benefits from higher sales of sport and gym clothing at department stores, and the acquisition of DBApparel and Maidenform Brands. When the company reports on Thursday, investors will look for an update to the full-year forecast and more color on the company’s recent acquisition of college logo clothing maker Knights Apparel. Ingersoll-Rand Plc, the maker of Trane air conditioners and Thermo King refrigeration units, is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by growth in global industrial and construction markets. Investors will be looking for the impact of a strong dollar on the company’s industrial business, which has a higher proportion of revenue coming from outside the United States. Investors will also be looking for an update on how much the weakness in oil prices has hurt the company’s newly acquired centrifugal compression business. Xerox Corp, which has been shifting its focus to IT services from making printers and copiers, is expected to report first-quarter revenue that is slightly below analysts’ estimate on Friday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Xerox had cut its profit forecast for 2015 for the second time after reporting its sixth-consecutive drop in revenue last quarter. In December, the company agreed to sell its IT outsourcing arm to Atos. Teck Resources Ltd, Canada’s largest diversified miner, is expected to report on Tuesday a lower profit in the first quarter as prices for both copper and steel-making coal remain depressed amid a fall in demand. The company in March denied media reports that it was in talks to merge with Chilean copper producer Antofagasta. Teck CEO also refuted speculations of a possible merger with HudBay Minerals or an acquisition of Zaldivar, a copper mine owned by Barrick Gold. Teck said in February it might reduce its dividend in July if the industry-wide production cuts fail to boost coal prices. Investors will be interested in any comments of a possible merger or acquisition and demand for steel-making coal. Car seat maker Lear Corp is expected to report higher first-quarter profit on Friday helped by strong demand in North America and a rise in vehicle production. Some analysts expect Lear to benefit from cheaper commodity prices and report higher margins. Investors will look for Lear’s comments on Mercato Capital seeking a split of the auto parts suppliers businesses. Investment bank and asset manager Lazard Ltd reports first-quarter earnings on Thursday. Lazard is expected to benefit from a jump in corporate dealmaking, which should have boosted its M&A; advisory business. Globally, deals worth $811.8 billion were announced in the first quarter, up 21 percent, compared to a year earlier. Among them, Lazard advised on the merger of Heinz-Kraft and the sale of Serbia’s state-operated Telekom Srbija. However, analysts expect lower-than-anticipated deal completions to weigh on the company’s quarterly revenue. Lazard has been focusing more on asset management to be less reliant on financial advisory fees. AutoNation Inc, the largest U.S. car dealer chain, reports first-quarter results on Wednesday. Investors will be watching margins on new car sales, any potential expansion moves and for any concerns about U.S. consumer spending going forward. On Thursday, Qlik Technologies Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue above analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, on higher demand for its data analytics software. The company had forecast full-year adjusted profit below analysts’ average estimate and its revenue forecast was also largely below Wall Street estimates. Touchscreen chipmaker Synaptics Inc is expected to report third-quarter profit below analysts’ estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, on weak demand from smartphone makers. Analysts have said that certain Samsung designs that have come out recently are not using Synaptics touch IC products. Online music streaming service provider Pandora Media Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue above analysts’ average estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company is expected to benefit from stronger listening hours and its gradual move into automobiles, where more than half of all radio listening occurs in the U.S. Investors will look for updates on user and local ad growth. On Wednesday, specialty mattress maker Select Comfort Corp is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts’ average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, halting a run of four straight quarters where sales beat expectations. Investors will be looking out for the company’s Sleep Number mattress sales as well as for any changes in full-year outlook. The company provided 2015 profit forecast below estimates in February. On Friday, Apigee Corp, which develops software to manage web applications, is expected to raise up to $92 million in its IPO, valuing the company at about $523.8 million at the higher end of its IPO price range. The company’s software platform allows businesses to design and deploy application programming interfaces (API) to link its core IT systems with data used by customers, others. The company primarily offers application interface management and predictive analysis services. On Tuesday, Canadian Finance Minister Joe Oliver will present the annual federal budget for the fiscal year that began on April 1, the last budget before the general election scheduled for October. He has promised a balanced budget and has pledged to introduce balanced budget legislation as well. The Conservative government has already introduced a package of tax cuts and family benefits, and infrastructure spending, that has soaked up much of the anticipated surplus. A decline in oil prices has cut much of the remaining room for maneuver. Prime Minister Stephen Harper has ruled out major stimulus spending, arguing that despite cheap oil the economy was still growing. On Thursday Mexico’s national statistics office will release economic activity data for February, after the gauge expanded in January on a pickup in services and agriculture while industry sank. Also on Thursday, Mexico will release annual inflation data for the first half of April, after the indicator picked up to 3.14 in March, reaching just above the central bank’s 3 percent target. Retail sales data released on Friday will reveal how the gauge fared in February, after it rose at its fastest pace in over a year in January. Monday, April 20 International Business Machines Corp is expected to report lower revenue for the 12th straight quarter, as it exits unprofitable businesses and attempts to move into cloud-focused areas, away from its traditional hardware and consulting services foundation. Net profit for the first quarter is expected to rise slightly. Morgan Stanley is expected to report a rise in first-quarter earnings. The company’s institutional securities business now depends more on equities trading business, rather than fixed income trading. Rival Goldman Sachs’s strong performance in stock trading in the first quarter puts the spotlight on Morgan Stanley. The bank has also been focusing more on its wealth management business. It is trying to squeeze more revenue out of its major businesses by getting wealth clients to use investment banking and trading services. Ruth Porat, Morgan Stanley’s chief financial officer, who helped execute a sweeping cost-cutting strategy across several business lines at the bank, will step down to join Google as its finance chief next month. Halliburton Co is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit, hurt by soft drilling activity. Oil producers have significantly scaled back spending amid weak oil prices. However, cost cuts and continued strength in the Middle East and Asia are expected to help the oilfield services provider minimize the effects of the oil downturn. The company has said it would cut more than 6,000 jobs and investors will seek details about any further cost cuts, especially after Schlumberger cut 11,000 more jobs. Halliburton is looking to complete its $35 billion-acquisition of smaller rival Baker Hughes, which is expected to report its own first-quarter results on Tuesday. Investors will want to know about more potential asset sales after Halliburton said earlier it would sell three businesses to pave the way for regulatory clearance for the deal. Investors will also look to see if the deal will help it better cope with pricing pressure from oil producers. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, the world’s second-largest cruise operator by revenue, is expected to report first-quarter profit and sales below analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company had forecast revenue below expectations, citing a strong dollar and weak pricing in the Caribbean. Investors will be looking out for any changes in full-year forecast and comments on the Caribbean market, as well as updates on expansion in Europe and Asia. Toymaker Hasbro Inc will report first-quarter results before the bell. The sequels of “Jurassic Park” and “The Avengers” in first half of 2015 and the new “Star Wars” movie in December are expected to boost Hasbro’s sales this year and keep it growing at a faster pace than larger rival Mattel Inc’s. Canadian National Railway reports its financial results for the first quarter. On average, analysts are expecting earnings to rise to 85 Canadian cents a share from 66 Canadian cents a year earlier, as revenue increases to C$3.04 billion. The company may discuss its safety record and the costs associated with its recent string of derailments as cleanup continues near the town of Gogama, in northern Ontario.  Rogers Communications Inc, Canada’s largest wireless phone provider and a major cable and media company, reports results for the first quarter. The company has lost ground in wireless and other subscriber metrics in recent quarters but has been able on average to charge its customers more, a trend investors will be eager to appraise.

130,TRV,Travelers profit misses estimates as investment income falls,"(Reuters) - Property and casualty insurer Travelers Cos Inc’s (TRV.N) quarterly net profit fell 21 percent, narrowly missing analysts’ estimates, as low interest rates and a drop in value of its energy investments squeezed the company’s net investment income.  Shares of Travelers, a Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI component, fell as much as 3 percent to $102.95. The stock was the second biggest drag on the index. Investment income at insurers has been falling for the past few years as the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at historical low levels since the financial crisis. The steep fall in oil prices since June also hit the company’s investments in the energy industry made through private equity funds. Energy-related private equity funds produced negative net investment income of $21 million after-tax, a company executive said on a post-earnings call.  Pretax net investment income, which accounts for nearly a half of the insurer’s operating profit, fell nearly 20 percent to $592 million in the first quarter.  Fixed-income investments will lose about $30 million on a quarterly basis for the remainder of 2015, the company said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. “A flat top line coupled with a lot of moving parts in their investment business have made investors a little leery,” S&P; Capital IQ analyst Cathy Seifert said.     Travelers’ net income fell to $833 million, or $2.55 per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $1.05 billion, or $2.95 per share, a year earlier. On an operating basis, Travelers earned $2.53 per share, narrowly missing analysts’ estimate of $2.54 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Travelers is one of the first U.S. insurers to report quarterly results and is thus seen as a bellwether for the industry. The company’s combined ratio, the percentage of premium revenue an insurer has to pay out in claims, rose to 90.3 percent in the quarter from 88.2 percent a year earlier. A combined ratio of under 100 indicates an underwriting profit.     Pretax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, rose to $162 million from $149 million while underwriting gains fell 21.6 percent to $620 million. The company said it will buy back an additional $5 billion shares and raised its quarterly cash dividend to 61 cents per share from 55 cents. Travelers’ shares were at $103.25 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

133,TRV,Fitch Affirms Travelers' Ratings; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed its ratings on The Travelers  Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TRV) as follows:  --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'A';  --Subordinated notes at 'BBB+';  --Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) on insurance company subsidiaries at 'AA'.  A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. The Rating  Outlooks are Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS TRV's ratings are supported by a strong competitive position as a top six U.S.  property/casualty insurer, an adequate reserve position, prudent capital  management, a history of solid earnings and financial flexibility.   TRV's market position and size/scale is characterized as 'Large' by Fitch given  its greater than 4% market share of the property/casualty industry measured by  net written premium. The company offers a wide range of insurance products to  both the commercial and personal lines markets and frequently occupies a top  tier position among independent insurance agencies. Capitalization at the operating company level scored 'Very Strong' on Fitch's  proprietary capital model, Prism, which is considered consistent with TRV's 'AA'  Insurer Financial Strength rating. Other measures of capital strength such as  operating leverage and net leverage ratios were 1.1x and 3.7x as of year-end  2014 and are at median guidelines for the current rating category. Fitch  estimates TRV's NAIC risk-based capital (RBC) was 289% of the company action  level at year-end 2014. TRV's debt-to-capital ratio was 21.6% at March 31, 2015, remaining within  management's stated target range of 15%-25%. Operating EBIT covered fixed  charges by 14.5x times during 2014, which is at the upper end of the range for  Fitch's median guidelines for the current rating category.  TRV's underwriting and return ratios remain at the upper end of the median  guidelines for the 'AA' rating category within Fitch's sector credit factors.  The combined ratio was 88.9% during the first quarter of 2015, essentially  unchanged from 2014 at 89.0%. All three business segments, Business and  International Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance, and Personal Insurance,  reported underwriting profits and favorable prior period reserve development.  Annualized return on stockholders' equity (ROE) was 14.4% for the first quarter  of 2015, down from 15.7% for the full year 2014. Profitability is expected to  decrease in the near term as net investment income continues to be challenged in  the low interest rate environment. Fitch expects share repurchase activity to reflect underlying profitability and  not reduce Travelers' capital strength. TRV repurchased 35.8 million common  shares during 2014 at a total cost of $3.3 billion. During the first three  months of 2015 TRV repurchased 6.3 million common shares at an average price of  $107 for a total cost of $672 million. At the close of the first quarter 2015  TRV's board of directors authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program in  addition to the $884 million remaining under the previous share repurchase  program. TRV has maintained significant holding company liquidity with $1.7 billion in  cash, short-term invested assets and other readily marketable securities at  March 31, 2015 compared to an estimation of one year's interest expense and  common dividends of $1.1 billion. TRV's liquidity profile is supplemented by an  $800 million commercial paper program that is backed by a $1 billion syndicated  credit facility that expires on June 7, 2018. During 2015, a maximum of $3.25  billion in dividends are available from TRV's underwriting subsidiaries without  the prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Department. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade include: --Capitalization at the underwriting subsidiaries that is inconsistent with  standards for the current rating category such as consolidated statutory net  leverage greater than 4.5x, a long-term increase in the financial leverage ratio  to greater than 25% or a deterioration in the Prism score to below the 'Very  Strong' category. --A GAAP fixed charge coverage ratio less than 8x on a run rate basis.  --A sustained period of net losses or catastrophe losses out of proportion with  the company's market share.  Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include:     --Improvement in TRV's capitalization measured by a Prism score of 'Extremely  Strong'. However, given publicly traded companies' sensitivity around managing  capital, this level of overcapitalization is unlikely.  --Sustained underwriting performance across business lines that is clearly  better than the industry and similarly-rated peers. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has assigned the following rating: --American Equity Insurance Company IFS 'AA'. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  The Travelers Companies, Inc. --IDR at 'A+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'  --5.50% senior notes due Dec. 1, 2015 at 'A'; --6.25% senior notes due June 20, 2016 at 'A'; --5.75% senior notes due Dec. 15, 2017 at 'A'; --5.80% senior notes due May 15, 2018 at 'A'; --5.90% senior notes due June 2, 2019 at 'A'; --3.90% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2020 at 'A';  --6.75% senior notes due June 20, 2036 at 'A'; --6.25% senior notes due June 15, 2037 at 'A'; --5.35% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2040 at 'A'; --4.60% senior notes due Aug. 1, 2043 at 'A'; --6.25% junior subordinated debentures due March 15, 2067 at 'BBB+';  --$800 million commercial paper (CP) program at 'F1'.

134,TRV,Connecticut governor proposes scrapping business taxes,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy on Friday proposed cutting planned business taxes by $223.7 million over two years after several large corporations threatened to leave the state. Connecticut’s state legislature passed a $40 billion biannual budget last week that hiked taxes by $1.2 billion over the next two years, prompting a backlash from businesses including General Electric Co, Travelers Companies Inc and Aetna Inc. Aetna and GE, both of which have headquarters in the state, have said they would consider leaving Connecticut. GE’s Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt said he had already assembled a team to look for alternative locations. Malloy’s plan involves scrapping a proposed increase on a tax on data processing, deferring the introduction of company-wide taxation, and raising a tax credit cap. Malloy, a Democrat, said he will ask the legislature to make cuts by 1.5 percent across the board. “Even as we have one of the lowest effective corporate tax rates in the nation, these steps are being made to protect Connecticut’s long-term interests,” Malloy said in a statement. Connecticut’s lawmakers will meet this month in a special session to implement the budget plan. That would allow them to pass Malloy’s amendments before the start of the fiscal year on July 1. “While the Connecticut business climate continues to be very challenging, this announcement is a step in the right direction.  We will review these changes in more detail and monitor developments through the special legislative session,” a spokesperson for Aetna said in a statement. Last week’s spending plan extended a temporary 20 percent surcharge on corporate tax, which makes Connecticut’s effective corporate tax rate 9 percent, compared with a base rate of 7.5 percent, the fifth-highest in the nation, according to the Tax Foundation. “The governor and the legislature should do the right thing for small and large businesses and the citizens of Connecticut to improve the economic vitality of the state,” GE said in a statement. The company did not comment on the substance of Malloy’s proposals. Travelers said it was “pleased that the governor has listened to the concerns expressed by the business community and has proposed changes to the budget.” “We will closely monitor the legislature’s reaction to these proposed changes,” the company said. Malloy’s revised plan also calls for revenue generated through sales tax on car washes and parking to be eliminated. Taxes on Internet services would be set at 1 percent.

136,TRV,Travelers profit beats estimates as catastrophe losses halve,"(Reuters) - Property and casualty insurer Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly operating profit as catastrophe losses halved and underwriting gains doubled. The company, led by industry veteran Jay Fishman, has aggressively raised insurance prices in the past several quarters to combat low interest rates that have kept a lid on insurers’ investment income over the past few years. Fierce competition, along with lower catastrophe premiums stemming from fewer big natural disasters in the United States, has driven a wave of consolidation in the industry - a situation Travelers said was not a cause for concern. In the industry’s biggest deal, Swiss insurer ACE Ltd ACE.N said this month it would buy Travelers’ arch rival Chubb Corp (CB.N) for $28.3 billion. “We already compete against these two companies, more so Chubb than Ace,” Travelers Chief Operating Officer Brian MacLean said on a call with analysts. “Given our business and geographic focus, we don’t anticipate a lot of difference in competing against them as a single entity.” The Dow-30 company, which vies with American International Group Inc (AIG.N) for the title of the biggest U.S. commercial property and casualty insurer, said its net income rose 19 percent to $812 million, or $2.53 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30. That compared with a net profit of $683 million, or $1.95 per share, a year earlier. Excluding a $32 million tax benefit, Travelers earned $2.41 per share, according to calculations by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $2.12 per share. Pretax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, fell to $221 million from $436 million, while underwriting gains almost doubled to $511 million. The company’s combined ratio, the percentage of premium revenue an insurer has to pay out in claims, was 90.1 percent in the quarter, compared with 95.1 percent a year earlier. A ratio below 100 percent means an insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims. Travelers is the first big U.S. insurer to report quarterly results. ACE reports results later on Tuesday, while Chubb reports on Thursday. Travelers shares were up marginally at $102.78 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Up to Monday’s close, the stock had fallen 3 percent this year.

Alan Schnitzer, chief executive of the Travelers’ business and international insurance, the company’s largest segment, will take over from Fishman, effective Dec. 1. Schnitzer, 49, has been with Travelers since 2007. Fishman, who has led the company since April 2004 when the St. Paul Companies Inc merged with Travelers Property Casualty Corp, said he could be dealing with a variant of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly called Lou Gehrig’s disease. “At every company there comes a time for new leadership. Because of the progression of my neuromuscular condition, this time has come a little earlier than I had hoped,” Fishman said in a letter to employees. ALS, whose cause is largely unknown, is an invariably fatal neurological disorder that attacks nerve cells in the brain, gradually weakening muscles. Fishman, 62, said last November that he had been diagnosed with a neuromuscular condition. At the time, he said that his condition had been slow progressing, though he said that he could soon be seen with a cane “or other gear” to help him get around. Under Fishman, the company’s stock value has more than doubled and the company has aggressively raised premiums in the past quarters to offset low interest rates. Fishman will become executive chairman and will remain on the board, Travelers said. Fishman also serves as a presiding director on the board of Exxon Mobil Corp.

143,TRV,UPDATE 1-Insurer Travelers' profit beats as underwriting gains surge,"(Adds details, estimate, shares) Oct 20 (Reuters) - Property and casualty insurer Travelers Cos Inc reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by higher underwriting gains. Travelers, which competes with American International Group Inc for the title of the biggest U.S. commercial property and casualty insurer, said underwriting gains rose about 35 percent to $759 million in the third quarter. Catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, rose to $85 million from $83 million, a year earlier. Travelers’ combined ratio, the percentage of premium revenue an insurer has to pay out in claims, fell to 86.9 percent from 90 percent.

145,TRV,Fitch Affirms Travelers' Ratings; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 02 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed its ratings on The  Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TRV), as follows:  --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'A';  --Subordinated notes at 'BBB+';  --Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) on insurance company subsidiaries at 'AA'.  See the full list of rating actions below. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS TRV's ratings are supported by a top-tier competitive position in the U.S.  property/casualty insurance market, prudent capital management, a solid reserve  position, a history of strong earnings and good financial flexibility.    Fitch views the company's market position and size/scale as 'Large' and notes  that companies with this profile are typically rated in the 'AA' category.  TRV  offers a wide range of insurance products to both the commercial and personal  lines markets and frequently occupies a top tier position among independent  insurance agencies. Capitalization at the operating company level scored 'Very Strong' on Fitch's  proprietary capital model, Prism, which is considered consistent with TRV's 'AA'  IFS rating.  Other measures of capital strength such as operating leverage and  net leverage ratios were 1.0x and 4.0x, respectively, as of Sept. 30, 2015 and  are consistent with median guidelines for the current rating category.   Fitch expects share repurchase activity to reflect underlying profitability and  will not reduce capital strength. TRV repurchased 21.5 million common shares at  a total cost of $2.2 billion during the first nine months of 2015 with $4.3  billion of capacity remaining under its share repurchase authorization. TRV's financial leverage ratio was 22.9% at Sept. 30, 2015, remaining within  management's stated target range of 15%-25%.  Operating EBIT coverage of fixed  charges was 13.6x during the first nine months of 2015, which remains at the  upper end of Fitch's median guidelines for the current rating category.  All three business segments - Business and International Insurance, Bond &  Specialty Insurance, and Personal Insurance - reported material favorable  reserve development through the first nine months of 2015. Business and  International Insurance reported favorable development of $229 million despite  $296 million of adverse development from asbestos and environmental. TRV's  period-over-period increase in favorable reserve development was contrary to  Fitch's expectation of declining favorable development for the property/casualty  industry in general.  The combined ratio was 88.9% during the first nine months of 2015, improving  modestly from 90.3% in the comparable period of 2014.  All three business  segments reported underwriting profits and favorable prior-period reserve  development.   Annualized return on stockholders' equity (ROE) was 14.8% for the first nine  months of 2015, down from 15.7% for the full year 2014.  Profitability is  expected to be pressured in the near term as the low interest rate environment  continues to challenge net investment income. The company has maintained strong financial flexibility with $2 billion in cash,  short-term invested assets and other marketable securities at Sept. 30, 2015.   The annual estimate of holding company interest expense and common dividends was  $1.1 billion.  Proceeds from August's senior debt issuance will be used to repay  $400 million in senior notes maturing in December 2015. Fitch believes that TRV has successfully transitioned between CEOs.  On Aug. 4,  2015, the company announced its chairman and CEO, Jay Fishman, would step down  on Dec. 1, 2015 and move into the role of executive chairman.  The new CEO is  Alan Schnitzer, who has worked for TRV since 2007, and previously was the chief  executive officer of Travelers' Business and International Insurance. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade include: - Capitalization at the underwriting subsidiaries that is inconsistent with  standards for the current rating category such as consolidated statutory net  leverage greater than 4.5x, a long-term increase in the financial leverage ratio  to greater than 25% or a deterioration in the Prism score to below the 'Very  Strong' category; - A GAAP fixed-charge coverage ratio less than 8x on a run-rate basis; - A sustained period of net losses or catastrophe losses out of proportion with  the company's market share.  Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include:       - Improvement in TRV's capitalization measured by a Prism score of 'Extremely  Strong'. However, given publicly traded companies' sensitivity around managing  capital, this level of overcapitalization is unlikely;  - Sustained underwriting performance across business lines that is clearly  better than the industry and similarly-rated peers. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS The following ratings have been affirmed by Fitch:  The Travelers Companies, Inc. --Long-term IDR at 'A+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1';  --5.50% senior notes due Dec. 1, 2015 at 'A'; --6.25% senior notes due June 20, 2016 at 'A'; --5.75% senior notes due Dec. 15, 2017 at 'A'; --5.80% senior notes due May 15, 2018 at 'A'; --5.90% senior notes due June 2, 2019 at 'A'; --3.90% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2020 at 'A';  --6.75% senior notes due June 20, 2036 at 'A'; --6.25% senior notes due June 15, 2037 at 'A'; --5.35% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2040 at 'A'; --4.60% senior notes due Aug. 1, 2043 at 'A'; --4.30% senior notes due Aug. 25, 2045 at 'A'; --6.25% junior subordinated debentures due March 15, 2067 at 'BBB+';  --$800 million commercial paper program at 'F1'.

146,TRV,"Travelers profit hurt by lower underwriting, investments gains","(Reuters) - Property and casualty insurer Travelers Cos Inc’s quarterly profit fell 16.6 percent as its underwriting gains declined and the company earned less from its fixed income and energy investments.  Travelers, the first big U.S. insurer to report quarterly results, said on Thursday that its underwriting gains fell 10.7 percent to $773 million in the fourth quarter. Net investment income declined 15.1 percent to $541 million. A steep fall in oil prices has been dragging on the company’s investments in the energy industry made through private equity funds. Oil prices have been touching new lows, with U.S. crude going below $27 per barrel on Wednesday, the lowest since 2003.  Travelers’ pretax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, rose to $46 million from $41 million. Net written premiums rose 0.5 percent. Combined ratio, the percentage of premium revenue an insurer has to pay out in claims, rose to 86.6 percent from 85 percent. A ratio below 100 percent means an insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims. Travelers, a Dow-30 component, competes with American International Group Inc for the title of the biggest U.S. commercial property and casualty insurer.

149,TRV,Texas storms bruise Travelers' quarterly profit,"(Reuters) - Property and casualty insurer Travelers Cos Inc  reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit as catastrophe losses nearly doubled, mainly due to hail storms in Texas in March. Travelers said on Thursday its pre-tax catastrophe losses jumped to $318 million in the quarter ended March 31 from $162 million a year earlier. In what is shaping up as a grim reporting quarter for insurers, home and auto insurer Allstate Corp said on Thursday it expected pretax catastrophe losses for the quarter jumped nearly threefold to $827 million. Two-thirds of those losses came from two severe storms in Texas in March, the company said. Travelers’ shares were down 4 percent at $111.38 in early trading on Thursday, and the stock was the biggest drag on the Dow Jones industrial average. Texas was hit by several storms in March, including tornadoes that toppled power lines, damaged structures and injured a number of people. Auto insurer Progressive Corp earlier reported a near 14-fold rise in catastrophe losses due to the storms, while Kemper Corp and United Insurance Holdings Corp  have said they expect their losses to increase sharply. Travelers’ net income fell to $691 million, or $2.30 per share, in the period from $833 million, or $2.55 per share, a year earlier. On an operating basis, the insurer earned $2.33 per share, falling short of analysts’ average estimate of $2.55 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Near-zero interest rates have added to insurers’ problems as investment income has remained weak. Travelers’ net investment income, which accounts for more than three-fifth of its earnings, fell 8.2 percent to $439 million in the first quarter. Storms in Texas are expected to add to insurers’ losses in the second quarter. Hail the size of baseballs caused widespread damage in the Dallas-Fort Worth area last week, shattering windshields and windows, while storms in Arkansas knocked down trees, crushing cars and homes. (reut.rs/1pj3az7) The Insurance Council of Texas, a insurance trade association, estimates that insurers are likely to incur $1.36 billion in losses due to the latest storm, making it the most expensive hailstorm for insurers in Texas history. Travelers, which vies with American International Group Inc  for the title of biggest U.S. commercial property and casualty insurer, increased its quarterly dividend to 67 cents from 61 cents. Up to Wednesday’s close, the company’s shares had risen 2.6 percent this year.",4212016,http://www.reuters.com/article/travelers-results/texas-storms-bruise-travelers-quarterly-profit-idUSL2N17O1T9

163,TRV,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Dollar hits 7-mth high on ECB's Draghi, pressures oil, stocks","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro fell to a four-month low against the U.S. dollar on Thursday and the greenback rose to its highest in seven months against a basket of major currencies after the European Central Bank President left the door open to more monetary stimulus. The rise in the U.S. dollar knocked down oil prices which are traded in dollars and pressured U.S. stock prices. The ECB left its ultra-loose monetary policy unchanged but President Mario Draghi kept a wide range of options open for further stimulus in December, shooting down any talk of tapering its 1.7 trillion euro asset-buying program. The U.S. dollar gained further after publication of a stronger-than-expected U.S. existing home sales report. “The move in the dollar hurt oil, which hurt energy, which hurt stocks,” said Stephen Guilfoyle, chief market economist at Stuart Frankel & Co. Crude oil prices fell just under 2.5 percent, also weighed by profit taking. A strong rally on Wednesday had taken prices to their highest in 15 months in the wake of unexpected inventory drawdowns. U.S. stocks were also pushed lower by weak earnings reports from index heavyweights such as telephone service provider Verizon Communications Inc  and insurer Travelers Companies, Inc . Telecom stocks were the worst-performing sector, down 2 percent, their worst one-day percentage drop since Sept. 9. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 40.27 points, or 0.22 percent, to 18,162.35. The S&P; 500 lost 2.95 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,141.34 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.58 points, or 0.09 percent, to 5,241.83. A measure of world equity markets .MIWD00000PUS fell 0.14 percent after touching a fresh one-week high following Draghi’s comments. European equities jumped following Draghi’s remarks, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index rising more than 1.0 percent from its lows before closing up 0.19 percent. The euro fell as low as $1.0916 versus the U.S. dollar, its lowest since June 24, helping the dollar index rise to its highest since March 10. “Draghi pushed back strongly against the idea that they could discuss tapering or adjusting QE and that weighed on the euro,” said Vassili Serebriakov, FX strategist at Credit Agricole in New York. The ECB head’s comments weighed on longer-dated U.S. Treasury prices, which dipped modestly. Benchmark 10-year notes were last down 1/32 in price to yield 1.749 percent. The greenback was also supported by relatively hawkish comments by New York Fed President William Dudley late on Wednesday. Dudley, a permanent voter on policy and a close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, said the U.S. central bank would likely raise interest rates later this year if the U.S. economy remained on track. The Mexican peso fell on Thursday after touching a six-week high in the immediate aftermath of the U.S. presidential debate between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton on Wednesday. The peso is seen as the chief proxy for market pricing of the Republican candidate’s chances in view of his promises to impose tough limits on immigration and rewrite trade deals. “The early polls suggest Clinton was once again the winner here and so the Mexican peso has been one of the most obvious beneficiaries,” said James Athey, fixed income investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. “The magnitude of the move, however, suggests that the market has largely concluded that Trump won’t win. That doesn’t mean that the result is a foregone conclusion. Markets, pollsters and pundits all predicted the wrong result in the UK’s referendum on EU membership. That should act as a cursory lesson now.” ",10202016,http://www.reuters.com/article/global-markets/global-markets-dollar-hits-7-mth-high-on-ecbs-draghi-pressures-oil-stocks-idUSL1N1CQ23C

174,TRV,Travelers' profit falls on higher catastrophe losses,"(Reuters) - Property and casualty insurer Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) reported an 11 percent fall in quarterly profit hurt by higher catastrophe losses and lower underwriting gains. The company also authorized a $5 billion share buyback program. Wind and hail storms in several regions of the United States, as well as a winter storm in the eastern part of the country resulted in higher catastrophe losses during the quarter. Net income fell to $617 million, or $2.17 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $691 million, or $2.30 per share, a year earlier. On a core basis, the company earned $2.16 per share. Total revenue rose 3.8 percent to $6.94 billion. However, net investment income rose 12 percent to $610 million, reflecting higher interest rates. December and March saw the latest hikes in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve. A 0.25 percentage point uptick in each case, the hikes marked only the second and third raise in seven years, after being kept near zero. Travelers invests a lot of its insurance premiums in investment grade bonds, which helped the company come out of the financial crisis in a good shape. Gains from underwriting, before tax, halved to $211 million. Pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, rose to $347 million from $318 million. The underlying combined ratio, the percentage of premium revenue Travelers pays out in claims, rose to 91.7 percent from 90 percent. A ratio below 100 percent means an insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims. Net written premiums rose 5.3 percent to $6.50 billion. St. Paul, Minnesota-based Travelers, the only property and casualty insurer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, is often considered a bellwether for the sector. American International Group Inc (AIG.N), with whom it competes for the title of the biggest U.S. P&C; insurer, reports first-quarter results on May 3.

175,TRV,Travelers' profit falls on higher catastrophe losses,"(Reuters) - Property and casualty insurer Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) reported an 11 percent fall in quarterly profit hurt by higher catastrophe losses and lower underwriting gains. The company also authorized a $5 billion share buyback program. Wind and hail storms in several regions of the United States, as well as a winter storm in the eastern part of the country resulted in higher catastrophe losses during the quarter. Net income fell to $617 million, or $2.17 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $691 million, or $2.30 per share, a year earlier. On a core basis, the company earned $2.16 per share. Total revenue rose 3.8 percent to $6.94 billion. However, net investment income rose 12 percent to $610 million, reflecting higher interest rates. December and March saw the latest hikes in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve. A 0.25 percentage point uptick in each case, the hikes marked only the second and third raise in seven years, after being kept near zero. Travelers invests a lot of its insurance premiums in investment grade bonds, which helped the company come out of the financial crisis in a good shape. Gains from underwriting, before tax, halved to $211 million. Pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, rose to $347 million from $318 million. The underlying combined ratio, the percentage of premium revenue Travelers pays out in claims, rose to 91.7 percent from 90 percent. A ratio below 100 percent means an insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims. Net written premiums rose 5.3 percent to $6.50 billion. St. Paul, Minnesota-based Travelers, the only property and casualty insurer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, is often considered a bellwether for the sector. American International Group Inc (AIG.N), with whom it competes for the title of the biggest U.S. P&C; insurer, reports first-quarter results on May 3. Through Wednesday’s close, Travelers stock had risen 1.7 percent so far this year.

178,TRV,Fitch Affirms Travelers' Ratings; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, June 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed its ratings on The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TRV), as follows: --Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) on insurance company subsidiaries at 'AA'/'Very Strong'; --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'A'; --Subordinated notes at 'BBB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. See the full list of rating actions below. KEY RATING DRIVERS TRV's ratings are supported by very strong capitalization, a history of favorable reserve development, a top-tier competitive position in the U.S. property/casualty insurance market, and very strong financial performance and earnings. Capitalization at the operating company level scored 'Very Strong' on Prism, Fitch's proprietary capital model, which is considered consistent with TRV's 'AA' IFS rating. Other measures of capital strength such as consolidated NAIC RBC and net leverage ratios were 300% of the company action level and 3.8x, respectively, as of Dec. 31, 2016, and are consistent with median guidelines for the current rating category. Fitch expects that share repurchase activity will reflect underlying profitability and will not reduce capital strength. TRV repurchased 1.9 million common shares under its share repurchase authorization at a total cost of $225 million during the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17). In April 2017, TRV's Board of Directors approved a $5 billion addition to the repurchase authorization, leaving $5.7 billion of capacity. Financial leverage remains within management's stated range and below Fitch's 25% rating sensitivity. In May 2017, TRV issued $700 million of 4% senior notes due in 2047. Fitch anticipates TRV using the proceeds from the planned issuance to repay $450 million in outstanding senior notes maturing in December 2017 and to fund a portion of the purchase price of the Simply Business acquisition. Fitch calculates that TRV's financial leverage ratio will be near 24% following the debt issuance, compared with approximately 22% at March 31, 2017. This calculation does not count debt redemptions. Reserves have a higher influence on TRV's ratings given a product mix that includes long-tailed lines of business such as workers' compensation and general liability insurance. Fitch's analysis of TRV's reserves continues to indicate a modestly redundant position which is supported by a history of favorable reserve development. The company's asbestos reserve survival ratio remains below Fitch's expectations of 11-13 years despite adjustments for settlement agreements that are less likely to develop adversely. Fitch views the company's business profile as very strong and notes that companies with this profile are typically rated in the 'AA' category. TRV offers a wide range of insurance products to both the commercial and personal lines markets and frequently occupies a top tier position among independent insurance agencies. Return on stockholders' equity (ROE) was 12.8% for 2016 and annualized first quarter 2017 ROE was 10.5%. 1Q17 profitability was suppressed by a lower level of favorable reserve development, partially tied to the Ogden discount rate adjustment, and increased catastrophe losses. Net investment income is expected to remain pressured in the near term by the prevailing low interest rate environment. Operating EBIT's coverage of fixed charges was 9.5x during 1Q17, which is down compared to full-year 2016's 12.1x and below Fitch's median guidelines for the current rating category. The consolidated combined ratio deteriorated during 2016 and 1Q17 to 92% and 96%, respectively. Business & International (B&I;) and Personal Lines have been responsible for the period-to-period decline in profitability. B&I; is by far TRV's largest segment, accounting for nearly 60% of total net written premiums in 2016. Workers' compensation and commercial multi-peril represent nearly half of net written premiums in the segment. B&I; reported an underlying combined ratio, excluding catastrophe losses and reserve development, near 94% for both full-year 2016 and 1Q17. Increasing loss-cost trends outpaced earned pricing and greater non-catastrophe weather losses explain the modest deterioration in recent results. TRV has a top-tier position in contract and commercial surety, private and non-profit management liability, and community banks. The Bond and Specialty segment has been consistently profitable with a five-year average combined ratio below 70%. Favorable prior year reserve development makes a significant contribution to profitability of this segment. TRV's Personal Lines segment, offering auto and homeowners insurance, remains modestly sized as the ninth largest domestic writer by net written premiums. The reported underwriting results were essentially break-even during 1Q17. Higher loss estimates in personal auto bodily injury liability coverages are the greatest contributor to the deteriorating underlying underwriting results in this line of business. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade include: --Capitalization at the underwriting subsidiaries that is inconsistent with standards for the current rating category such as consolidated statutory net leverage greater than 4.5x, a long-term increase in the financial leverage ratio to greater than 25% or a deterioration in the Prism score to below the 'Very Strong' category; --A GAAP fixed-charge coverage ratio less than 8x over an extended period; --A sustained period where the combined ratio exceeds 100% or the operating ratio exceeds 90%; --A persistent and material deterioration in reserve adequacy. Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: --Improvement in TRV's capitalization measured by a Prism score of 'Extremely Strong'. --Sustained underwriting performance across business lines that is clearly better than the industry and similarly-rated peers. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS The following ratings have been affirmed by Fitch: The Travelers Companies, Inc. --Long-Term IDR at 'A+'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F1'; --5.75% senior notes due Dec. 15, 2017 at 'A'; --5.80% senior notes due May 15, 2018 at 'A'; --5.90% senior notes due June 2, 2019 at 'A'; --3.90% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2020 at 'A'; --6.75% senior notes due June 20, 2036 at 'A'; --6.25% senior notes due June 15, 2037 at 'A'; --5.35% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2040 at 'A'; --4.60% senior notes due Aug. 1, 2043 at 'A'; --4.30% senior notes due Aug. 25, 2045 at 'A'; --3.75% senior notes due May 15, 2046 at 'A'; --4.00% senior notes due May 30, 2047 at 'A'; --$800 million commercial paper program at 'F1'.

180,TRV,Travelers' quarterly profit falls on higher catastrophe losses,"(Reuters) - Property and casualty insurer Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) reported a 10.4 percent fall in quarterly profit on Thursday, hurt by higher catastrophe losses and lower underwriting gains. Pretax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, rose to $403 million in the second quarter, from $333 million a year earlier, mainly due to wind and hail storms in several regions in the United States. Underwriting gains slumped 54 percent to $112 million in the quarter ended June 30, the company said. However, net investment income rose 5.9 percent to $468 million, helped in part by higher private equity returns.  Combined ratio, the percentage of premium revenue Travelers pays out in claims, rose to 96.7 percent from 93.1 percent. A ratio below 100 percent means an insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims. Net income fell to $595 million, or $2.11 per share, in the  quarter, from $664 million, or $2.24 per share, a year earlier.  On a core basis, the company earned $1.92 per share.

187,TRV,Insurer Travelers beats Wall Street profit estimate after hit from storms,"(Reuters) - Travelers Cos Inc’s (TRV.N) quarterly profit fell less than Wall Street expected after a severe Atlantic storm season, helping its shares up slightly on Thursday, but it warned investors of large claims likely this quarter from wildfires raging in California.  The No. 2 U.S. commercial property and casualty insurer recorded $700 million in catastrophe losses from the destruction wrought by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which caused a 59 percent drop in core earnings. However, that was less than Wall Street had feared, and paying claims now may end up helping Travelers and other insurers to raise rates gradually as people and businesses renew their premiums.  “Customers are well served by stable and predictable market that keeps pace with inflation as opposed to the higher pricing swings of the past,” said Travelers Chief Executive Alan Schnitzer on a conference call with analysts. However, Schnitzer warned of significant fourth-quarter catastrophe losses from California wildfires. The company paused a share repurchase plan in September to conserve cash as it reviewed storm claims, and it is still evaluating that position in the light of wildfire claims, he said.  Shares of Travelers, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, were up 0.7 percent in midday trading. For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, Travelers’ net income dropped 59 percent to $293 million. Excluding the effect of realized investments and some other items, the company earned 91 cents per share, trumping analysts expectations of 43 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It benefited from a decline in income tax expense. Net written premiums rose 4.2 percent to a record of $6.7 billion.  U.S. insurers were clobbered by unusually vicious storms during August and September, in which Hurricanes Harvey and Irma struck within less than two weeks of each other leaving billions of dollars of destruction in Texas and Florida. Hurricane Maria followed weeks later, devastating Puerto Rico. Travelers said catastrophe losses rose 700 percent from a year ago, as Texas suffered from historic rains caused by Harvey and Irma pummeled Florida and several southern states. As a result, Travelers’ combined ratio rose to 103.2 percent from 92.9 percent a year ago. A ratio below 100 percent means an insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims and expenses.

Hurricane Maria followed weeks later, devastating Puerto Rico. Travelers said catastrophe losses rose 700 percent from a year ago, as Texas suffered from historic rains caused by Harvey and Irma pummeled Florida and several southern states. As a result, Travelers’ combined ratio rose to 103.2 percent from 92.9 percent a year ago. A ratio below 100 percent means an insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims and expenses.

193,TRV,Travelers says it is in 'right spot' for cyber insurance exposure,"(Reuters) - Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) plans to stick to its recent growth pace for sales of cyber insurance, which protects businesses against hacking and other liabilities, despite potential to boost it, as the insurer assesses risks in the segment, its head of specialty insurance said on Monday. “We feel like we’re just in the right spot,” Thomas Kunkel, the insurer’s president of bond and specialty insurance, said during an investor meeting in Connecticut.  Travelers has increased its cyber business at a 40 percent compound annual growth rate since 2011 and could quicken the pace, Kunkel said. “It would not be hard,” he said. But Travelers must be “respectful and prudent” about the risks involved in cyber, Kunkel said. Insurers have said the growing sophistication of hackers alongside a still-evolving cyber insurance industry makes it difficult to quantify their potential cyber-related losses. About three-quarters of cyber policies that Travelers writes cover up to $1 million in damages, while nearly a quarter cover between $1 million and $5 million, the company said.  “We manage our limits very closely,” Kunkel said. Equifax Inc (EFX.N), which compiles credit information about consumers and assigns them scores, disclosed in September that cyber criminals had breached its systems between mid-May and late July and stolen the sensitive information of 145.5 million people. The hack is among the largest ever. Regulation will also drive demand for cyber insurance, particularly in the financial services sector, Fitch Ratings said in a report on Monday. “As the cyber insurance market develops, competition is likely to erode profit margins,” Fitch said.  Some insurers who ultimately enter the cyber market may lack underwriting experience and take on risks that could exceed their capital, Fitch said. Events that could trigger large claims include cyber attacks on electronic grids and transportation systems, or hacks of large data storage clouds, Fitch said. Insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N) said on Oct. 26 that it was reviewing all types of coverage it offers to gauge its exposure to cyber risk. AIG will start including cyber coverage as part of its commercial casualty insurance during the first quarter of 2018, Tracie Grella, global head of cyber risk insurance, said at the time. The move would boost rates but also make it clearer how customers are covered if they are the victim of a security breach. Many commercial insurers offer stand-alone cyber coverage, but it is not yet a standard addition to most other policies, such as property and casualty.

The processing system outage began at about 7:30 p.m. EST and was resolved about 9:30 EST, the customs agency said in a statement. All airports were back on line after wait times for travelers that were longer than usual, it said. “At this time, there is no indication the service disruption was malicious in nature,” the agency said. It gave no explanation for the disruption and said travelers were processed using alternative procedures. Travelers entering the United States from overseas posted photos on social media of long lines at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. “No one has been getting past JFK Airport immigration for the last hour. Line is a few 100 deep. Seems like their system did completely go down. Happy New Year!” said Jessica Yang, a program manager at Microsoft, in a Twitter post.  Other airports, including Denver International Airport, also said they were affected. A similar computer outage occurred a year ago. “Operations returning to normal as @CustomsBorder computer issue resolved. Issue affected other US airports.

202,TRV,Travelers fourth-quarter profit beats on premium growth; shares jump,"(Reuters) - Property and casualty insurer Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) core adjusted fourth-quarter earnings beat Wall Street expectations as growth in premiums offset a rough period for catastrophe losses from California wildfires, it said on Tuesday. Travelers, like other companies in the sector this quarter, swallowed a $129 million charge related to the new U.S. tax law, which contributed to its net income falling 42 percent to $551 million, or $1.98 per share, from $943 million, or $3.28 per share, a year earlier.  Shares of the New York-based Travelers, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, jumped 4 percent at $144.98 in late-morning trading.  “There has been a lot of speculation about how corporate tax reform will impact pricing,” said Travelers Chairman and Chief executive Officer Alan Schnitzer in prepared remarks during a conference call with analysts. “Tax reform helps but we still have ground to cover.”  The tax rate is just one factor affecting premium prices necessary to reach the company’s financial goals, Schnitzer said, along with expenses and insured losses. On an adjusted basis, Travelers earned $2.28 per share, handily beating the average analyst estimate of $1.51, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net written premiums in the quarter rose 6 percent to $6.42 billion. Travelers’ pretax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, more than tripled to $499 million from $137 million a year earlier, as a result of the California wildfires.  The figure was lower than the forecast range of $525 million to $675 million. California wildfires in 2017 were the most destructive and deadliest in the state’s history, wrecking more than 21,000 homes and 2,800 businesses. Catastrophe losses in the quarter weighed on the insurer’s underwriting gains, which slumped 45 percent to $216 million.   As a result, its combined ratio, which measures an insurer’s profitability, worsened to 95.5 percent from 90 percent a year ago. A ratio below 100 percent indicates the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims and expenses. Despite rising interest rates, net investment income fell 5.3 percent to $467 million.     Travelers’ revenue rose 3.6 percent to $7.45 billion.

On a core basis, the New York-based company earned $2.46 per share, missing analysts’ average estimate of $2.68, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Travelers, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average that is seen as a bellwether for the insurance sector because it typically reports earlier than its competitors, said catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, widened 2 percent to $354 million in the first quarter. The company blamed winter storms in the eastern United States, a wind and hail storm in the southern United States and deadly January mudslides in Southern California that killed more than 20 people for the rise. The catastrophe losses partly offset the benefits of a more favorable U.S. corporate income tax rate, which spurred a 21.3 percent drop in the insurer’s income tax expenses, and underwriting gains, which rose 22.3 percent to $258 million. Net investment income fell 1 percent to $603 million, due to  lower private equity returns compared with a year earlier, the company said. Net written premiums rose 5 percent to $6.82 billion, due in part to rate increases. Last year, many insurers said they had planned to hike rates after suffering steep U.S. catastrophe losses due to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and wildfires in Southern California. Net income rose to $669 million, or $2.42 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31 from $617 million, or $2.17 per share, a year earlier.     The company reported a combined ratio of 95.5 percent, compared with 96 percent a year earlier. A ratio below 100 percent means an insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims. Total revenue rose 5 percent to $7.29 billion.  Travelers reported $452 million in after-tax income for its business insurance unit, an increase of 2.3 percent from $442 million during the prior year quarter. Losses in the unit’s workers’ compensation line were lower than expected, but that was offset by losses in the insurer’s commercial automobile line, which were higher than expected, the company said.

The company reported a combined ratio of 95.5 percent, compared with 96 percent a year earlier. A ratio below 100 percent means an insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims. Total revenue rose 5 percent to $7.29 billion.  Travelers reported $452 million in after-tax income for its business insurance unit, an increase of 2.3 percent from $442 million during the prior year quarter. Losses in the unit’s workers’ compensation line were lower than expected, but that was offset by losses in the insurer’s commercial automobile line, which were higher than expected, the company said. Travelers shares were down $4.50 at $132.73 on the New York Stock Exchange.
