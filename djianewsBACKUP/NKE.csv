1,NKE,UPDATE 2-Li Ning sees fall in H1 revenue; shares plunge," * Sees sales revenue down 5 pct in H1, gross profit margin down   * Sees profit margin narrowing in H2 as raw-material costs rise   * Q4 order value up, volume drops   * Shares plunge to lowest in more than two years   (Add analyst comment, details, stock price)	   By Donny Kwok	   HONG KONG, July 7 (Reuters) - Shares of Chinese sports brand Li Ning Co Ltd fell to their lowest in more than two years after the company said it expected a fall in first-half sales and profit margin due to rising costs and a revamp in its distribution channels.	   Li Ning, which sells everything from running shoes to sports bags, also said margins for the rest of the year could narrow.	   The stock, which has lost 29.1 percent so far this year, fell as much as 15 percent to HK$11.66, its lowest since March 2009. The shares pared some losses to trade down 14.7 percent, lagging the Hang Seng Index’s 0.66 percent rise.	   “The figures were a disappointment and that its lower profit margin worried investors the most,” said Alex Wong, a director at fund-management firm Ample Finance Group.	   “Its a type of company (that we are concerned about) nothing but marketing,” Wong said, adding the firm needs to further strengthen marketing and branding to boost margins.   In a filing to the Hong Kong bourse, Li Ning said it expected revenue to decline 5 percent in the first half of 2011 from a year ago as it moves to revamp distribution channels.	   Li Ning, China’s home grown sporting goods brand, is expected to announce first-half results  in August.	   The company, founded by a famous Chinese athlete with the same name who is known as the Prince of Gymnastics in China, said its gross profit margin was expected to decline by 1 percentage point due to a new wholesale discount policy and increases in raw material costs.	   Profit margin attributable to shareholders is expected to decline to 6-7 percent in the first half from 12.9 percent a year ago.	   Due to expected significant increases in raw material costs in the second half of 2011, Li Ning also forecast gross profit margin for the period to decrease from last year.	   Profit margin attributable to shareholders for the full year 2011 is expected to decline by about 1-2 percentage points compared with the first half, it added.	   Same-store sales growth maintained a low single-digit pace from January to June, with the total number of Li Ning brand stores at the end of June  at 8,163. It did not give comparison figures.	 	   Li Ning, whose founder and chairman had won three gold medals at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, is facing growing competition from foreign companies including Nike and Adidas (ADSGn.DE) and local rivals such as ANTA Sports Products Ltd and Peak Sport Products Co Ltd .	   Analysts said they expected an increase in demand for higher-end sporting goods as Chinese income rises.	   “Competition within the industry is intensifying and the overall competitive landscape is presently shifting,” Chairman Li Ning said in the statement, adding the firm’s financial performance would be affected in the near term.	   “The group believes that the transformation of the industry, the shifts in the competitive landscape, and the adjustments it has made in its strategies will become clearer in the next two to three years,” said Li.	   Last week, Nike raised its sales forecast for its namesake brand, betting that strong Chinese and Brazilian demand and a price increase in the coming year will help it outpace rising costs. 	   Li Ning said order value for the fourth quarter of 2011 rose more than 5 percent year on year, though order volumes declined at a high single-digit rate.	   Its growth in fourth-quarter order value was slower than rivals such as ANTA Sports’ 25 percent rise and Xtep’s  24 percent growth.

2,NKE,Big-name brands sourcing from polluting China firms,"BEIJING/BANGALORE (Reuters) - Some of the world’s leading clothing brands rely on Chinese suppliers that pollute rivers with toxic, hormone-disrupting chemicals banned in Europe and elsewhere, environment group Greenpeace said on Wednesday.  Adidas, Nike, Puma, Calvin Klein, Lacoste, Abercrombie and Fitch and China’s Li Ning were among the global names identified in the Greenpeace report, following a year-long investigation.  The report focused on two major Chinese suppliers, the Youngor Textile Complex in Ningbo on the Yangtze River Delta and the Well Dyeing Factory in the Pearl River Delta near Hong Kong.  All the brands mentioned in the report have confirmed they source products from one of the two Chinese suppliers, Greenpeace said.  Greenpeace’s Li Yifang said China had yet to implement a systematic chemicals management policy, but responsibility must also lie with global firms outsourcing to China to cut costs.  “None of the corporations mentioned in our report have a comprehensive, publicly available policy that ensures that their suppliers are eliminating hazardous chemicals from their supply chain. So, we believe they are perpetuating toxic pollution,” she told reporters at the report’s launch.  To mark the release of the report, volunteers from the group unveiled banners outside the world’s biggest Adidas store in Beijing’s fashionable Sanlitun Village shopping area before being quickly ushered away by management staff.  In an emailed response to Greenpeace, Abercrombie had said Well Dyeing had not signed up for a social responsibility program that Abercrombie is part of.  The program monitors human rights and environmental compliances between companies and their suppliers.  “At this point, the mill will either sign up for the Apparel, Mills and Sundries program immediately or we will hire third party auditors to assess the situation in Zhongshan, China,” Abercrombie said in the email dated June 21.  Greenpeace’s Li said samples taken from the wastewater discharges from the two facilities revealed the presence of heavy metals and hazardous, hormone-disrupting substances such as alkylphenols and perfluorinated chemicals.  These chemicals can harm immune and endocrinological systems as well as the liver, are non-degradable and cannot be removed by water treatment plants, which is why they have been restricted across the European Union and the United States.  “We take the problem which Greenpeace raised seriously, and we will work with Greenpeace to find a solution,” Youngor said in a statement provided to the environmental group.  Nike, Puma and Adidas said the companies only run cut-and-sew facilities, which does not warrant the use of chemicals.  “To the best of our knowledge, we are not contributing to the pollution of the Yangtze Delta through our factory partners,” Simon Wainwright, a Nike spokesman, said.  “Nike currently sources from two factories of the Youngor Group Co ... These factories are cut-and-sew facilities; they do not have manufacturing processes that include use of the chemicals called out by Greenpeace.”  Sabrina Cheung, director of corporate communications at Adidas, told Reuters: “The Adidas Group does not source fabrics from Youngor Group, which would involve the use of dyestuffs, chemicals and their associated water treatment processes.”  Puma said it only used Youngor Knitting for cutting, sewing and finishing and, as per its information, that unit operates at a different location to the Youngor Group fabric mill.  “Youngor Knitting is also not using any fabrics of the Youngor Group for the production of Puma goods,” Puma said.  When asked by Reuters whether they would end their business relationships with one of the Youngor units in order to send a message to the wider group, both Puma and Adidas said no.  “Where factories have issues, it is our practice and policy to work with them to resolve and remedy those problems,” a spokeswoman for Adidas in Germany said.  For its part, Li Ning said: “We have asked them to investigate their pollutant discharge immediately and report back to us.”  PVH Corp, which owns the Calvin Klein brand, did not respond to requests for comment.  China has identified water as one of its most pressing environmental problems, with many of its major rivers contaminated by toxic run-offs from factories and farms.  China’s environment ministry said in June 16.4 percent of its major rivers did not even meet standards required for irrigating crops.  After a spate of burst tailings dams and untreated chemical discharges, tougher policies are being drawn up to cut heavy metal pollution in China’s rivers by 15 percent over five years.  But China remains far behind the rest of the world, Greenpeace’s Li said.  “We think our government should really act fast to develop a policy. China is really lagging behind because this was already a top issue in the developed world in the 1970s, and we are only just beginning to recognize the problem.”  ",7132011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-chinapollution-greenpeace/big-name-brands-sourcing-from-polluting-china-firms-idUSTRE76C5I420110713

4,NKE,China fashion market to surpass $201 bln by 2020-BCG," SHANGHAI, July 15 (Reuters) - China’s fashion market is expected to triple in size to more than 1.3 trillion yuan ($201.3 billion) in the next 10 years driven by the rise of the middle-class affluent consumer in China, Boston Consulting Group said in a report on Friday.	   China’s fashion market, currently dominated by sportswear brands and local casual clothing brands, was worth around 400 billion yuan in 2010. Per capita spending among urban consumers was a low 1,150 yuan per year, roughly one-fifth of per capita spending in the United States and the United Kingdom, BCG said.	   “Per capita consumer spending in China is still in the early part of the penetration curve compared with that in mature markets, giving China the potential to become an even more significant fashion market,” the report said.	   The low penetration rate means China will account for 30 percent of the global fashion market’s growth over the next five years.	   China’s fashion scene is dominated by sports brands such as Nike Inc , Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE) and Li Ning who entered the market early and now have thousands of retail outlets spread across the country.	   However, that could change as consumers across cities “trade up” and become more sophisticated, preferring a variety of brands to suit different occasions, BCG said. 	   BCG also estimates that companies would need to have a presence in 568 cities in China in order to reach 80 percent of the mid- to high-priced fashion market in 2020, up from 462 currently.	   Rising incomes in China have led to a flood of fashion companies such as Gap and American Eagle Outfitters  thronging to get a piece of the market.	   But a fragmented retail distribution network and the inability of international firms to localise their products have led to exits of some consumer retail firms such as Best Buy  and Home Depot .

5,NKE,China polluters to face tougher fines under new law: report,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Polluting Chinese enterprises will be fined more than 10,000 yuan ($1,549) per day if they fail to comply with environmental rules, according to new legislation currently being considered by the government, an official newspaper said on Friday.  The Economic Information Daily, published by the Xinhua news agency, cited sources as saying that the draft of the new law would be released publicly later this year and submitted for approval during next year’s session of parliament.  China, struggling to strike a balance between economic growth and environmental protection, has found it difficult to force industrial enterprises to comply with pollution rules, with the current range of fines and “administrative punishments” regarded as too small to serve as a deterrent.  The report cited experts as saying that the law would provide a new “legal weapon” to ensure that enough compensation is paid for environmental disasters. By significantly raising costs, it would also force small and polluting enterprises to close, it said.  However, the new fines might not be enough to deter some larger state-owned firms.  The paper said that state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), parent company of PetroChina, paid just 1 million yuan in fines and 5 million yuan in “aid” after an explosion at one of the company’s plants in northeast China’s Jilin province in 2005.  The blast contaminated the Songhua River with a torrent of toxic benzene that cost the government 7.84 billion yuan to treat, the report added.  Environmental group Greenpeace said on Wednesday that two major Chinese suppliers to global clothing brands like Adidas and Nike were contaminating rivers with hormone-disrupting chemicals banned in Europe and elsewhere.  Around 16 percent of China’s rivers are not even clean enough for irrigation purposes, according to official figures, and following a spate of chemical plant explosions, burst tailings dams and untreated toxic run-offs, China has committed to cleaning up its water supplies over the next five years.

Shares in Adidas had fallen more than 4 percent on Tuesday as traders cited concerns that the company’s second quarter had been weak.

Adidas shares have been trading at record highs this year, reaching 57.62 euros on Monday.	   Hainer said the movement in the group’s share price over the last two days was “purely driven by speculation”.	   Adidas is due to report second-quarter results on Aug 4. It has raised its sales outlook twice this year and sees 2011 sales growing by a high single-digit percentage. 	   Analysts are looking for an 8 percent rise in sales to 12.98 billion euros ($18.43 billion) for 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.	   However, rising raw material costs and sales lost in Japan, one of its most profitable markets, following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami mean its profit margin will likely come in flat, Adidas has said.	   Chinese rival Li Ning flagged high raw material costs this month, saying they would hurt profit margins.

9,NKE,Chinese retailers hijack the Ikea experience,"KUNMING, China (Reuters) - Nestled in a sleepy southern district of Kunming city in southwest China, is a 10,000 square meter, four-story building that could make Swedish furniture giant Ikea uneasy.  11 Furniture, as the store is known, copies Ikea’s blue and yellow color scheme, mock-up rooms, miniature pencils, signage and even its rocking chair designs. Its cafeteria-style restaurant, complete with minimalist wooden tables, has a familiar look, although the menu features Chinese-style braised minced pork and eggs instead of Ikea’s Swedish meatballs and salmon.  This knock-off Ikea store is emblematic of a new wave of piracy sweeping through China. Increasingly sophisticated counterfeiters no longer just pump out fake luxury handbags, DVDs and sports shoes but replicate the look, feel and service of successful Western retail concepts — in essence, pirating the entire brand experience.  “This is a new phenomenon,” said Adam Xu, retail analyst with Booz&Co. “Typically there are a lot of fake products, now we see more fakes in the service aspect in terms of (faking) the retail formats.”  Brands are much more than a logo on a handbag or some half-eaten pipfruit on a computer.  Many of the most successful consumer companies have invested millions in promoting and building brands which encapsulate ideals, values and aspirations, creating valuable and loyal customer bases that sometimes border on cults.  Last month, an American blogger set off a media storm after she posted pictures of an elaborate fake Apple Store in Kunming, selling genuine if unauthorized iPhones, Macbooks and other widely popular Apple products.  The presence of the fake stores in Kunming highlights China’s seemingly insatiable appetite for western brands in some consumer segments that have not been tapped, particularly in smaller cities far from the affluent eastern seaboard.  “What these fake stores indicate is that there is demand for the types of products and concepts that these brands sell,” said Hong Kong-based Torsten Stocker, a China retail analyst with Monitor Group.  The problem for companies that have been faked is that even if the fake stores sell genuine products, the brands have no control over how customers experience their brands.  Zhang Yunping, 22, a customer service representative at 11 Furniture, is used to the questions about Ikea.  “If two people are wearing the same clothes, you are bound to say that one copied the other,” Zhang said, shrugging her shoulders.  “Customers have told me we look like Ikea. But for me that’s not my problem. I just look after customers’ welfare. Things like copyrights, that is for the big bosses to manage,” she said.  11 Furniture’s owner could not be reached for comment.  Ikea said it has teams working at both the country and global level to handle intellectual property protection issues.  “Ikea as one of the biggest home furnishing companies in the world, protecting Ikea’s intellectual property rights is crucial,” Ikea China said in a statement to Reuters.  At 11 Furniture — its Chinese name “Shi Yi Jia Ju” sounds very much like Ikea’s Chinese name “Yi Jia Jia Ju” — furniture is made to order, not flat-packed as it is at Ikea.  Customers also notice other differences.  Ikea has nine stores in China, most of them in the wealthier coastal and southern cities. Xiao Lee, a Kunming resident who was shopping at 11 Furniture for a bedroom wardrobe with her husband, had visited Ikea stores in Beijing and Shanghai.  “I thought of shipping their products from the real Ikea store by cargo, but I thought that would be too troublesome so I came here,” Lee said.  “At the real Ikea, the layout is much neater and the decorations are laid out properly, you really can’t compare them,” she said.  Sometimes telling the difference between fake and real is not so easy.  “My favorite character is Mickey Mouse,” said Ling Xiao, a six year-old girl walking out of a Disney Store along Kunming’s popular pedestrian-only shopping street Zhengyi Road.  Ling Xiao and her mother shop at the Disney store about once a month and they have been going there for the past few years to browse for Mickey Mouse handbags and accessories.  “It should be real; it has been here a long time. I prefer coming to this store because it sells a big variety of toys,” said Ling Xiao’s mother, who declined to be named. Apart from Disney products, the store sells poorly made Angry Bird soft toys of dubious origin.  A Walt Disney spokeswoman said there are over 6,000 points of sale for Disney branded goods in China. Disney confirmed the store is legitimate, declining to elaborate further.  Outside a Nike store on the same retail strip, Han Zhimei, a 17 year-old student, looks longingly at a “Help Wanted” sign posted in the store’s window.  “I feel their stores have a spirit of teamwork and I really like the Nike brand,” said Han, who sports a trendy asymmetrical haircut. Han stopped by to apply for a job at Nike.  When asked how she knows the store is a legitimate reseller and that the goods are real, she pauses before answering.  “Well, it’s a Nike store, so the things in there should be real. I think people will be honest about these things and we should have brand loyalty,” Han said.  On Zhengyi Road alone, there are four Nike stores, all claiming to be legitimate. A check with Nike’s store locator brought up three stores in that street, meaning at least one is fake.  A Nike NIKE.N spokesman said the issue of unlicensed stores was part of the broader challenge of combating counterfeiting in China.  “We take the protection of our brand very seriously and have a variety of protocols in place,” a Nike spokesman said.  The jumble of real and fake stores in lower tier cities across China makes it hard for companies such as Apple, Disney, Nike and more so Ikea, which are closely identified with their outlets, to exert control over their brand image.  Companies such as Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) have long battled copycats in China, but the shift to imitations of the likes of Ikea presents a new set of challenges.  “The store is a key element of the brand, so faking it, in particular in a way that consumers don’t recognize as a fake, is impacting the brand image and reputation,” said Stocker.  Apple, which had its brand valued at more than $150 billion earlier this year, declined to comment.  For those setting up the fake, unauthorized or pirated goods stores, the attraction is obvious.  “We don’t need to advertise, everyone has heard of Disney,” said Dong, a 23-year-old store supervisor at a Walt Disney retail store a stone’s throw from where Ling Xiao and her mother were shopping.  That brand recognition has far outstripped the ability of companies to expand fast enough to tap demand exploding in inland China.  Sportswear brands such as Nike, Adidas and Li Ning, which have been in China for many years, are the leading fashion choice for those residing in less wealthy cities like Kunming, said a Boston Consulting Group report last month.  As the world’s second-largest economy races forward, the number of middle-class affluent households is expected to hit 130 million by 2020 from 50 million in 2010, BCG said.  These factors are fueling the race for brands like Nike and Adidas to open stores in less wealthy Chinese cities. Ikea has said it will open an average of one to two stores a year in China.  “Many foreign brands are already aware of the importance of lower tier cities but they are trying to figure out a way to go to market in these cities,” said Xu of Booz&Co.  In some cases, beating them to the punch are the Chinese pirates who, once established, may be hard for foreign companies to get shut.  Chinese law prohibits firms from copying the “look and feel” of other companies’ stores, but foreign companies must register their trademarks with China and enforcement is often spotty.  The United States and other Western countries have often complained China is woefully behind in its effort to stamp out intellectual property (IP) theft.  “Foreign companies often expect the Chinese government to handle their enforcement for them and though they sometimes will, they also sometimes will not,” said Dan Harris, a lawyer with Harris & Moure and co-author of China Law Blog.  “The problems often arise from the fact that the damages are often quite low and the Chinese courts do not have a lot of power to make sure their own judgments are enforced,” Harris said.  Back at 11 Furniture, it is apparent that copying Ikea’s ideas may not be enough to win over all consumers.  Examining cushion covers at 11 Furniture, Ms. Zhang, a woman in her fifties, sniffs derisively.  “The designs don’t look like typical Chinese designs. It’s not what everyday Chinese people would use,” Zhang said, pointing to a checkered cushion cover.  “It looks too fancy.”  ",8012011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-brand-piracy/chinese-retailers-hijack-the-ikea-experience-idUSTRE77017720110801
10,NKE,WRAPUP 2-European consumer goods groups defy gloom," * Unilever, Adidas and Beiersdorf see Q2 sales boost   * Pricing, weather and emerging markets all help   * Shares of all three groups move higher   (Adds further CEO quotes, updates shares)	   By David Jones and Victoria Bryan	   LONDON/FRANKFURT, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Some of Europe’s biggest consumer goods groups defied high input costs and tepid demand in home markets to report higher second-quarter sales on Thursday.	   Unilever (UNc.AS), Adidas (ADSGn.DE) and Beiersdorf  raised prices, saw emerging market growth and benefited from a warm spring in Europe.	   With an array of top brands like Lipton, Knorr and Dove, Unilever was able to push its prices higher, Adidas saw its Chinese sales rise 41 percent and Beiersdorf enticed consumers back to its key Nivea brand.	   Strong quarterly sales boosted all three stocks. Unilever Plc shares were up 4 percent at 19.80 pounds, Adidas rose 1.6 percent to 49.60 euros and Beiersdorf increased 0.3 percent to 42.76 euros by 1500 GMT, bucking the gloomy market trend. World stocks posted their largest daily fall in a year on Thursday as worries about a global slowdown intensified. 	   Anglo-Dutch Unilever expects its input commodity costs for the likes of vegetable oils and chemicals to rise 15 percent this year, but it pushed through big price rises of 5.1 percent in the second quarter to see underlying sales beat forecasts with a 7.1 percent rise. 	   “Unilever’s results in our view look impressive, showing a sharp acceleration in sales growth from 4.3 percent in Q1 to 7.1 percent in Q2,” said analyst Graham Jones at Panmure Gordon.	   With commodity cost pressures appearing to peak and most price rises now complete, analysts said Unilever was on track to meet Chief Executive Paul Polman’s goals of sales volume growth and profit margin expansion for 2011.	   In the first six months of 2011 the group saw 10 percent plus sales growth in China and India and broad-based growth across south east Asia as it benefited from having a higher proportion of its sales in emerging markets than its rivals.	   Germany-based Adidas raised its sales forecast for the third time this year, with its three-stripe branded sportswear and especially running shoes and sports fashion products selling well .	   It now expects a 10 percent rise after reporting a second-quarter increase of 5 percent as demand for sportswear soared and its big North American market remained strong.  	   “Why are people buying? It keeps them healthy and fit and this is what people want, they want to enjoy their life,” Chief Executive Herbert Hainer told reporters after results.	   “No matter which retailer I speak to, or which market share statistic I read, our product sell-throughs are stronger than they have ever been,” he added.	   The group which competes with Nike and smaller rival Puma said it expects less of a decline in Japan than previously forecast following the earthquake and tsunami earlier this year.	   “Good for the sentiment in our opinion is especially the positive outlook for the U.S. business in the remainder of the year,” said DZ Bank analyst Herbert Sturm.	   Fellow German group Beiersdorf was also upbeat after seeing its core consumer division back in growth, helped by a marketing revamp and 100th anniversary campaign for Nivea, and saw second- quarter consumer sales up 1.6 percent after a similar fall in the first quarter. .	   The group, whose other brands include luxury skincare line La Prairie and Labello lip balm, tweaked its sales guidance for the year, saying it expects slight sales growth in 2011, compared to a previous guidance for flat revenues.	   Chief Executive Thomas Quaas said the Nivea programme “generated positive momentum at retailers and among our consumers in the second quarter”, and added he had not noticed any significant impact on those European countries that are struggling with debt crises such as Greece and Italy.	   “Q2 operating performance was strong. Consumer organic sales showed a sharp improvement over Q1 due to the one-off benefits from the weather and sell-in ahead of the Nivea 100th anniversary launch,” said analyst Andrew Wood at Bernstein.	   One area Beiersdorf was not doing well was in China where sales were well below 2010 levels due to a reorganisation after a failed move into haircare, although some products such as Nivea for Men, deodorants and La Prairie performed well.

13,NKE,UPDATE 3-Disney's consumer products chief resigns," * Andrew Mooney says wants to pursue other ambitions   * Consumer products accounts for 6 pct of revenue   * Disney shares down 2.2 pct  (Adds comments on Mooney’s departure, updates shares)   By Lisa Richwine   LOS ANGELES, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) consumer products chief resigned on Tuesday to pursue other leadership roles, after running the unit for nearly 12 years.   Andrew Mooney, known for creating the popular Disney Princess franchise, “has decided to resign from his post,” Disney said in a statement. A replacement has not been named.   In an email to employees that was released by Disney, Mooney thanked Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger “for his understanding in my desire to pursue other ambitions.”   Mooney, 55, said it was the “perfect time” to take his experience at Disney and, before that, at shoe and apparel maker Nike (NKE.N) “into a leadership role with another organization and corporate boards.”   A source familiar with the matter said Mooney had reached the point where he wanted to run his own company and to consider offers to serve on corporate boards. Disney forbids its executives from sitting on other companies’ boards.   Revenue at Consumer Products, the second fastest growing Disney segment, climbed 13 percent to $685 million in the quarter ended July 2, accounting for just above 6 percent of the theme park operator and media company’s total revenue that quarter.   Miller Tabak analyst David Joyce said Mooney may already have fielded CEO offers from other companies after a solid record at Disney.   “He’s done a good job there. The consumer products division is integral to the overall brand and character development at Disney,” Joyce said.   A native of Scotland, Mooney created the Disney Princess franchise, bringing Disney’s Snow White, Cinderella and other princesses under one umbrella.   He also oversaw the merchandising of characters from popular films such as “Toy Story” and “Cars” and revamped the retail Disney Stores. He will stay at Disney through the end of the month, which marks the end of Disney’s fiscal year.   “Not only has he consistently delivered business results year after year, but his focus on the Disney brand and the creation of new franchises like Disney Princess will leave a legacy for decades,” Iger said in a statement.   Before joining Disney, Mooney spent 20 years at Nike, rising to chief marketing officer.   Shares of Disney were trading 2.2 percent lower at $31.75 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, a steeper drop than the 1.3 percent decline in the Standard & Poor’s media index. .GSPME  (Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Steve Orlofsky, Gary Hill)  ",9062011,http://www.reuters.com/article/disney-consumer/update-3-disneys-consumer-products-chief-resigns-idUSN1E78514U20110906

As of 0306 GMT, Belle International shares were down 8.24 percent after dropping as much as 9.5 percent earlier. The benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI was down 0.62 percent.  “The shares are to be sold at the lower end of a range, reflecting a lack of enthusiasm to buy the shares. Long-term funds are not interested in buying in this volatile market,” said UOB Kay Hian sales director Steven Leung.  Analysts said the selldown suggested the stock price had already peaked and more or less reflected its earnings outlook.  UBS AG UBSN.VX said in a research note on Thursday that they had raised concerns over the expansion of Belle, China’s largest retailer of women’s footwear, into the lower price segment.  “Given uncertainty on the new strategy and share disposal, we believe Belle’s share price will likely be under downward pressure in the near term,” UBS said in the note.  Belle, a strategic partner of Nike Inc (NKE.N) and Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE), said on Thursday that its management would sell 240 million shares, a 2.846 percent stake, at HK$15.28 each, valuing the deal at HK$3.67 billion ($470 million).  In a filing to the Hong Kong bourse, Belle said management including Chief Executive Sheng Baijiao, but excluding Executive Directors Tang Yiu and Sheng Fang, had engaged Morgan Stanley & Co International and Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Ltd to place the shares.  According to a term sheet seen by IFR on Wednesday, executives of Belle planned to sell about $567 million worth of shares in a range of HK$15.28-15.70 each. The stock closed at HK$16.26 on Wednesday.  Despite the selldown, analysts said Belle was a better bet than its peers as it was not facing serious inventory problems.

Huntsman’s campaign named Mack, executive chairman of the Morgan Stanley (MS.N) board; Nike Inc (NKE.N) chairman Knight; Gary Loveman, chief executive of Caesars Entertainment Corp [HAMLEO.UL]; and Tom Bell, a former U.S. Chamber of Commerce chairman as advisers.   Mack, due to retire as Morgan Stanley’s chairman at the end of the year, will serve as chairman of Huntsman’s Business Advisory Council.   Mack was an early backer of Hillary Clinton when she ran for the Democratic nomination in 2008 but has been a supporter of Republicans in the past.   Huntsman, a former Utah governor and ambassador to China for President Barack Obama, is seen as the most moderate of the Republican contenders in a race largely dominated by the conservative wing of the party.

19,NKE,Greenpeace shifts climate focus to industry from U.N.,"LONDON (Reuters) - Greenpeace has shifted its campaign focus toward confronting polluting companies, away from lobbying deadlocked U.N. climate talks, the global head of the environmental group told Reuters on the eve of its 40th anniversary.  The group was exploring a new strategy to target banks which backed fossil fuel companies and nuclear power as well as forest destruction, said Kumi Naidoo.  U.N. climate negotiations have fallen short of a treaty after an acrimonious summit in Copenhagen in 2009 when world leaders failed to agree binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.  The group was also ramping up investment in emerging economies. Such countries will account for the bulk of growth in planet-warming emissions in the future.  “The U.N. process is still a central part of the mix but the proportion of investment has changed,” said Naidoo.  “We’ve probably reduced our focus on the U.N. in terms of staff time, actual campaigning resources ... by at least 50 percent,” compared with two years ago, he said.  “We know that the big polluting companies are a stumbling block. We think that by going after them that will indirectly help the negotiating process.”  The global financial crisis and a skeptical U.S. Senate have stalled U.N. efforts to broker a successor to the Kyoto Protocol whose first round of binding emissions cuts expires at the end of next year.  The next major U.N. climate conference in Durban at the end of the year is not expected to produce a deal.  Greenpeace recently ran a campaign to try and disrupt oil exploration by the British-based Cairn Energy in the Arctic Ocean, which the green group argues is too fragile to cope with oil spills.  High oil prices are pressing companies to drill in new areas including deeper waters further offshore.  Naidoo also cited the group’s recent campaign targeting sport clothing brands to combat pollution of Chinese rivers. Nike, Puma and Adidas have since said they would meet Greenpeace’s key demand.  “Our demand was that they needed to develop a plan to phase out by 2020,” he said.  Where companies were not well known brands, Greenpeace aimed to bring consumer pressure through their creditors.  “They’re not global brands,” Naidoo said of large conglomerates, referring for example to the U.S. Koch family which has diverse industrial interests and funded opposition to a Californian climate law.  “We need to find a new way to put pressure on them. We’ve allocated some resources to develop a financial sector strategy.”  The new approach was in line with the founding principle of “bearing witness” to injustice when Greenpeace was founded 40 years ago on Thursday, he added. Greenpeace says it raised 226 million euros last year, including donations from 2.8 million people.

It could take a little more time, people shouldn’t be disappointed.”  The week’s economic calendar includes reports on the beleaguered housing market along with weekly initial jobless benefits claims.  Housing “is dead and it will stay dead, and I don’t expect anything out of unemployment either,” said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.  “The biggest event is Bernanke.”  Companies due to post earnings next week include homebuilder Lennar Corp (LEN.N), Nike Inc (NKE.N), General Mills Inc (GIS.N) as well as technology companies Adobe Systems (ADBE.O), Red Hat Inc (RHT.N) and Oracle Corp ORCL.O.

24,NKE,"RPT-Wall St Week Ahead: Bernanke, Europe hold key to rally"," (Repeating item that initially moved on Friday)   By Chuck Mikolajczak   NEW YORK, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Wall Street hopes for more Fed action and clear signs European leaders will follow through on their new urgency to tackle the euro zone debt crisis if U.S. stocks are to build on their best week since early July.   Investors expect the Federal Reserve to take steps to pull down long-term interest rates when policymakers meet on Tuesday and Wednesday to help revive the persistently weak U.S. economy. For details, see [ID:nS1E78E0BA]   Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, speaking in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Aug. 26, said the Fed’s Open Market Committee would meet for two days in September instead of the scheduled one day to discuss ways to boost the recovery.   But even with expectations of more intervention to boost the economy, investors will keep a close eye on developments in Europe.   The Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX posted a 5.4 percent gain last week, its best since early July. The Nasdaq composite index .IXIC gained 6.3 percent for the week while the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 4.7 percent   Any lack of progress or backsliding on efforts to get the currency bloc’s fiscal house in order will renew worries the crisis could seriously damage the world financial system and major economies.   “The Fed is really going to dominate next week,” said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont.   “But the market has been trying to work its way higher here, trying to feel if maybe the European thing won’t cascade out of control.”   U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, at a meeting of euro zone finance ministers in Poland on Friday, urged them to leverage their bailout fund to better tackle the debt crisis, but there was no agreement on what steps to take. [ID:nL3E7KG0KC]   While the Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX has been moving upward over the past week, the benchmark index has been stuck in roughly a 100-point range over the last six weeks.   It is likely to run into resistance near the 50-day moving average of about 1,228, with analysts also pointing to the 1,250 level as the next significant hurdle.   “This is really a consolidation phase, which is normal after the kind of early August swoon that we had. So far this trading range is developing in a very positive and healthy way,” said Gail Dudack, chief investment strategist at Dudack Research Group in New York.   “Longer term, the market is looking better but we are getting very close to that resistance at 1,250, which would be pretty surprising if we can break above that at this early juncture. It could take a little more time, people shouldn’t be disappointed.”   This week’s economic calendar includes reports on the beleaguered housing market along with weekly initial jobless benefits claims.   Housing “is dead and it will stay dead, and I don’t expect anything out of unemployment either,” said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. “The biggest event is Bernanke.”   Companies due to post earnings this week include homebuilder Lennar Corp (LEN.N), Nike Inc (NKE.N), General Mills Inc (GIS.N) as well as technology companies Adobe Systems (ADBE.O), Red Hat Inc (RHT.N) and Oracle Corp ORCL.O.

25,NKE,Analysis: Netflix's new name is slow to catch hold,"(Reuters) - It’s difficult to remember, harder to spell and may go down as one of the biggest brand blunders in recent memory — meet Qwikster.  Starting in a few weeks those familiar red envelopes that arrive with DVDs in millions of mailboxes will no longer carry the name Netflix, as they have since 1998. Instead, they will come from the newly branded Qwikster, a name Netflix Inc Chief Executive Reed Hastings choose because “it refers to quick delivery.”  It can also be tricky to spell, sounds vaguely like a 1990s software firm, and is already the Twitter handle of someone named Jason Castillo, who uses a pot smoking Elmo as his Twitter profile picture.  “They’ve chosen Qwikster, which is a really weird name for the DVD mailing business,” said Barbara Sullivan, Managing Partner of Sullivan, a branding and marketing agency. “Quick relative to what? The name implies speed that isn’t there.”  “What’s very unusual about his move is that the well-known brand name is going to the new business,” said Tim Calkins, a professor at Kellogg School of Management. “It’s not sticking with the old business. Very often it is the new technology that is accompanied by a new brand name. It’s very unusual to see new technology paired with an old brand name.”  Others pointed out that companies have transitioned into new businesses without sacrificing a strong brand name, including Apple Inc expanding to phones from computers and Nike Inc expanding to sweatsuits from sneakers.  The main reason companies will change their name is because they are trying to escape a scandal. For instance, Blackwater, the private security firm, changed its name to Xe in hopes of distancing itself from controversy related to its work in Iraq and Afghanistan. Philip Morris Co replaced its name with Altria Group.  Netflix has also suffered from bad press recently due to its decision to hike its subscription fees, a move that cost it customers and pressured its stock price.  But most branding experts said Netflix’s decision was based more around long-term strategy than its PR headaches.  “It’s very bold, and they are clearly betting their future on streaming,” said Emily Heyward, director of strategy at Red Antler, a branding and design agency. “To do that, do they need to amputate limb to save the body?”  Heyward said one of the biggest issues today is finding brand names that aren’t already in use somewhere in the world, and ones that still have a website URL available. “It’s why you have so many startups with funky spellings and misspellings.”  Another branding expert, Adam Hanft, CEO of Hanft Projects, said the name change will probably prove a benefit as more customers turn to streaming — and cancel the DVD service — in years to come.  “Hastings is looking forward and recognizing that history is not on the side of the Qwikster business, history is on the side of the steaming business. It seems the appropriate thing to do to identify the future with the strong brand, Netflix.”  Still, Hanft noted the irony of naming the slower service — the one that comes through the post office rather than high speed telecommunications lines — Qwikster.  “Of course, they weren’t about to name it Oldster.”  ",9192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-netflix-qwikster/analysis-netflixs-new-name-is-slow-to-catch-hold-idUSTRE78I60520110919
26,NKE,"Strong demand, price increases help Nike top Street","(Reuters) - Nike Inc (NKE.N) topped Wall Street’s profit estimates as the world’s biggest athletic shoe and clothing maker staved off margin pressure with strong sales and price increases, sending its shares up more than 5 percent in trading after the bell.  The company, which also owns brands like Converse, Cole Haan, Umbro and Hurley, said sales rose 35 percent in emerging markets and 15 percent in Greater China. Together these regions contribute about 23 percent of Nike’s business.  Sales in North America rose 16 percent in the first quarter.  The Nike brand’s futures orders, a closely watched measure of demand in coming months, were up 16 percent to total $8.5 billion.  Demand for shoes and clothes carrying the swoosh logo scheduled for delivery from September through January 2012 were up 27 percent in China and 22 percent in other emerging markets.  “All indications are that the brand is continuing to gain momentum in a world where many retail driven companies are seeing pretty subdued revenue growth,” Matt Arnold, consumer discretionary analyst for Edward Jones, said.  “(The growth) is very much poised to continue, and with the product innovation they have ... they should be set up to succeed in the holiday period,” he said.  Like all apparel makers, Nike has been facing margin pressures as raw materials and freight charges get more expensive, but price rises and more sales from high-margin company-owned stores and its website ensured a smaller hit in the first quarter.  Gross margins slid by 270 basis points, below the 300-basis-point fall the company had anticipated.  Nike, which competes with European sportswear groups Adidas (ADSGn.DE) and Puma (PUMG.DE), saw income rise 15 percent to $645 million, or $1.36 a share. Overall revenue rose 18 percent to $6.08 billion.  Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $1.21 a share on revenue of $5.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

28,NKE,COLUMN-Green indices muddy sustainable investing-Gerard Wynn," (Gerard Wynn is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own)	   By Gerard Wynn	   LONDON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Sustainability data can help spot winners in a future, greener economy, but only with active political lobbying to abolish fossil fuels subsidies, for example, as sagging equity markets revive talk of alternative investment approaches.  	   Environmental social and governance (ESG) data measure performance in areas like health and safety, labour rights, corruption and transparency on carbon emissions reporting. 	   ESG leaders can out-perform in equity markets, as related indices point to quick-witted, high-achieving companies. 	   The rapid response of Puma, Adidas and Nike to Greenpeace demands to halt discharge of toxins into Chinese rivers illustrated ESG awareness in leading companies. 	   Such companies want to be seen as green, but whether they are is more complicated.	   That uncertainty is reflected in broad ESG indices which may claim to be sustainable but use broad criteria which could please many but fail to capture anything precise. 	   The UK green group Forum for the Future and the investment arm of insurers Aviva PLC published a report this month which tried to capture what types of companies would flourish in a sustainable economy of 2040.	   Such companies may underperform now, given government policies and resource limits may still disadvantage them.	   The low-carbon sector, one narrow aspect of ESG, has underperformed oil and gas and wider benchmarks, see chart below. 	   Active lobbying must accompany sustainable investing: G20 governments pledged to abolish fossil fuel subsidies two years ago, but that promise is unfulfilled despite prodding by the International Energy Agency (IEA).	   The Aviva/Forum for the Future report pictured how five key sectors - food, health, energy, mobility and finance - should look in 30 years time, for example in resource efficiency and social justice. 	   	   Broad green indices apply sustainability criteria across a wide range of stocks, to catch a wide, investable mix. The approach can yield inconsistent results. 	   The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) has over the past nine years successfully pressed the world’s biggest companies to reveal environmental strategies by sending a questionnaire and publishing the answers.	   In its global 500 report last week, it suggested “a strong correlation” between returns on investment in a company’s shares and an index which measures corporate fulfilment of emissions targets.	   The top leaders in the index were Philips Electronics, BMW, Honda Motor Company, Tesco, Bank of America, Westpac Banking Corporation, Bayer, Cisco Systems, SAP and Sony Corporation. 	   Philips and Cisco are positioning in energy efficiency but it’s hard to explain all these low-carbon leaders. 	   Among automakers, BMW makes just two and Honda none of the 72 low carbon-emission models qualifying for zero road tax in Britain, according to the Vehicle Certification Agency. 	   The Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) identified three identical companies including Philips and BMW in its 19 “supersector leaders”, based on a broad questionnaire ranging from gender equality to remuneration transparency. 	   The DJSI has performed well compared with world stocks.	   How to make indices, or ESG data, deliver something more precise is the challenge.	   A sector-specific approach, for example focused on wind, solar or energy efficiency, runs the obvious problem of a less liquid group. HSBC has selected companies which make revenues from climate change-related themes, for a broader base.	   But sector approaches also risk losing broader sustainability themes such as corporate governance and social responsibility, and dropping ESG leaders. Governance in particular, the checks and balances of how a company is run, is key to performance. 	   Active investors argue that in sustainability, in particular, a discriminating, hands-on approach is needed, using ESG data and FTSE Group-type scoring to spot companies more likely to thrive in a sustainable world with tougher social governance and environmental laws.

34,NKE,Nike sees strong worldwide demand,"(Reuters) - Nike Inc (NKE.N) staved off margin pressure in the first quarter with strong revenue and price increases, and said it was confident about its position among peers as it heads toward the winter holidays.  The world’s biggest athletic shoe and clothing maker topped Wall Street’s profit and sales estimates, and its shares rose more than 5 percent in after-hours trading.  “We continue to see solid growth in footwear and apparel sales, which tells me the growing middle class in developing markets is increasing consumption and that consumers everywhere are ready to buy when they feel good about what they get for their money,” Chief Executive Mark Parker said on a conference call with analysts.  Futures orders for the Nike brand, a closely watched measure of demand in coming months, were up 16 percent to total $8.5 billion.  Demand for its swoosh logoed shoes and clothes scheduled for delivery through January were up 27 percent in China and 22 percent in other emerging markets.  “All indications are that the brand is continuing to gain momentum in a world where many retail driven companies are seeing pretty subdued revenue growth,” Matt Arnold, consumer discretionary analyst for Edward Jones, said on Thursday.  “(The growth) is very much poised to continue, and with the product innovation they have ... they should be set up to succeed in the holiday period,” he said.  Net income for Nike rose 15 percent to $645 million, or $1.36 a share, for its first quarter ended August 31, from $559 million in the year ago period.  Revenue rose 18 percent to $6.08 billion, from $5.18 billion in the year ago period.  Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $1.21 a share on revenue of $5.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The company, which also owns brands like Converse, Cole Haan, Umbro and Hurley, said revenue rose 35 percent in emerging markets and 15 percent in Greater China. Together these regions contribute about 23 percent of Nike’s revenue.  Revenue in North America rose 16 percent.  Finish Line (FINL.O), the majority of whose merchandise comes from Nike, reported on Thursday that sales rose more than 10 percent for the second quarter. Sales of high margin lightweight shoes are expected to contribute to margin expansions in the next quarter, Finish Line’s Chief Financial Officer Ed Wilhelm told Reuters in a telephone interview.  Gross margins at Nike slid by 270 basis points to 44.3 percent during the first quarter from the year ago hurt by higher product costs and discounts.  However, the fall in gross margins was lower than what the company had anticipated as more sales at its high margin company owned stores, and website and price increases helped.  The company previously said it expected its gross margins to fall by at least 300 basis points in the first quarter.  Nike said during its conference call that it expects gross margins for its second quarter to be down about 200 basis points.  The Nike brand has seen no push back from customers as its shoes and clothes grow more expensive, Charlie Denson, president for the Nike brand, said in a conference call with analysts.  Rival Adidas (ADSGn.DE) and Puma (PUMG.DE) also raised prices this year, reacting to higher costs of materials.

37,NKE,Nike eyes $4 billion in China sales by 2015 -- WSJ,"Oct 11, Reuters - Sports apparel maker Nike Inc has set a target of boosting its annual sales in China to $4 billion by 2015, its chief financial officer told the Wall Street Journal in an interview in Shanghai. But to reach that goal, Nike will have to help change the exercise and recreational sporting habits of Chinese citizens. “China has one of the biggest populations who are tuned into sports, but they aren’t yet participants,” CFO Don Blair told the Journal. The sportswear company had sales in China of about $2.1 billion last year, according to a market research firm cited by the Journal. In its fiscal first quarter ended Aug. 31, Nike reported China sales of $528 million. The Oregon-based company plans to open more stores in China and emphasize Chinese sports stars with which it has endorsement deals, such as French Open tennis champion Li Na, the Journal reported. Nike, which sells its products in 7,500 outlets in China, is hoping a tie up with Chinese track star Liu Xiang will lead to increased sales of its running and athletic gear, the report said. It is also planning to host a snowboarding event near Beijing next year in an effort to boost interest in its apparel for the sport that gains popularity with each Winter Olympics.",10112011,http://www.reuters.com/article/nike-china/nike-eyes-4-billion-in-china-sales-by-2015-wsj-idUSN1E79A24F20111011
38,NKE,"UPDATE 1-ANTA sees Q3 sales growth slowdown, shares dive","* Shares of Chinese sportswear brands fall sharply * Analysts see price competition continuing * Nike, Adidas gain market share in China   (Recasts with analyst comment, details) By Donny Kwok HONG KONG, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Chinese sportswear brand ANTA Sports Products Ltd said on Tuesday that it expects a slowdown in same-store sales growth for the third quarter, sending its shares to the lowest in 29 months. ANTA was down 15.7 percent at HK$6.66 at 0253 GMT, the lowest since May 2009, against a 3.2 percent fall in the Hang Seng Index . Its rivals also fell sharply as investors raced to dump shares in the highly competitive sector. Xtep International Holdings Ltd was down 11.6 percent, China Dongxiang (Group) Co Ltd slid 9.1 percent, and Li Ning Co Ltd  fell 8.2 percent. “It is a sector that has already passed its growth peak,” said Conita Hung, head of equity research of Delta Asia Financial. “Apart from racing to clear inventories, they must think of a way to regain market share and to better position themselves for the challenges ahead.” In the sportswear industry’s battle for China’s booming consumer market, the situation is bad and getting worse for local retailers, which are further squeezed by global brands expanding aggressively in the high-end and low-end segments. After years of breakneck expansion, local brands such as Li Ning and China Dongxiang (Group) Co Ltd are grappling with shrinking margins, slowing sales growth and mounting inventories of outdated products. While the Chinese brands struggle, Nike Inc and Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE), armed with heavy investment in research and development, and marketing expertise, are gaining market share in the world’s second-largest economy. In a filing to the Hong Kong bourse late on Monday, ANTA Sports said the expected sales slowdown from the previous quarter was due to the challenging local sportswear retail market in China. ANTA said it had offered sharper discounts to retailers and distributors in the third quarter, which analysts said would further undermine its profit margin. Orders for products to be delivered in the second quarter of next year would also slow from the first quarter of 2012, it added. In August, ANTA Sports said orders for delivery in the first quarter of 2012 rose 15 percent in value from the same period this year. Analysts said investors should avoid the sector as price competition was expected to continue and that might damp earnings. 361 Degrees International Ltd , another Chinese sportswear brand, said on Monday that same-store sales for the third quarter of 2011 grew 14.1 percent year on year. Analysts said they suspected the company could sustain the growth.

39,NKE,Adidas raises 2011 outlook on emerging markets,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany’s Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE) lifted its 2011 sales outlook on strong demand for its sporting goods in emerging markets and as it expands its high margin brand-name stores. Adidas now expects 2011 sales to increase at a rate close to 12 percent, adjusted for currency swings, where it had previously seen an increase of around 10 percent, the company said on Thursday. “This will be driven by the Group’s high exposure to fast-growing emerging markets, the further expansion of Retail as well as continued momentum at all key brands,” said Adidas, which is the world’s second-largest maker of sports apparel after Nike (NKE.N). This is the fourth time this year Adidas has upgraded its sales forecast as demand for its three-stripe branded products soars, with running shoes and fashion products proving especially popular with U.S. and Chinese consumers. For 2012, Adidas said it was now setting its sight on growth in earnings per share of 10-15 percent, driven by the UEFA European soccer championship in Poland and Ukraine and the 2012 Olympic Games in London. Revenue next year is projected to increase at a mid to high single-digit rate on a currency-adjusted basis. Operating profit in the third quarter rose 7.3 percent to 441 million euros ($609 million), just shy of the 442 million expected on average by analysts. Quarterly sales of 3.74 billion exceeded the average analyst estimate of 3.65 billion. Adidas said it was on track to reach sales of 17 billion euros by 2015, aiming to grow faster than its rival Nike. For now, the U.S. sports-equipment industry leader is having a harder time passing higher cotton and rubber prices and soaring labor costs in China along to customers. Nike reported a 2.7 percentage point slide in gross margins to 44.3 percent during the three months to August and projected a further decline by 2 percentage points in the quarter to November. Adidas, in turn, forecast a 2011 gross margin of 47.5-48 percent, compared with 47.8 percent last year. “Although we continue to face pressures from higher input costs as well as volatility on currency markets, we are well prepared for continued top- and bottom-line growth,” Chief Executive Herbert Hainer said. The group also said it agreed to buy Five Ten, a U.S. maker of shoes for climbing and biking, for $25 million, taking a small step to shore up its fledgling outdoor equipment business. Adidas wants to more than double sales of that business to above 500 million euros by 2015.

42,NKE,Adidas eyes basketball boost after NBA lockout ends,"FRANKFURT, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The chief executive of Adidas, the world’s second largest sportswear company, is eyeing a year-end boost to its basketball business following the end of the NBA lockout in the United States. Over the weekend, the National Basketball Association (NBA) and its players reached a tentative deal on a new collective bargaining agreement, which paves the way for a shortened 66-game season to start on Christmas Day. For sports apparel companies such as Adidas and Nike  as well as retailers like Finish Line and Footlocker , it was important for the season to start up before Christmas to avoid losing sales in the busiest shopping weeks of the year. Analysts had said Adidas could face losing up to half of its sales of licensed NBA apparel should the lockout drag on and the company had admitted at its third-quarter results in November it expected licensed apparel sales to be hit. “Without any doubt, the start of the season in December will help us to continue our growth momentum and finish the year strong in the largest basketball markets, North America and Greater China,” Adidas CEO Herbert Hainer said in comments emailed to Reuters. Adidas said its overall sales of basketball products in North America were up 21 percent in the first nine months of the year, compared with an 11 percent rise for the division on a global basis. Footlocker, which sells branded shoes of Nike and Adidas, saw its shares rise 9 percent on Monday after the news.

Nike shares were up 3 percent at $96.65 in after-market trade on Tuesday, after closing at $93.63 on the New York Stock Exchange. Worldwide futures orders for the Nike brand, a closely watched measure of demand in coming months, grew 13 percent to $8.9 billion at the end of the quarter. In Greater China, pre-placed orders scheduled for delivery from December 2011 through April 2012 rose 31 percent, with a 12 percent rise in other emerging markets. “(Results were) slightly better in every line but you kind of expect that with Nike ...,” said Rahul Sharma, managing director of investment management firm Neev Capital. “What it really highlights is that you can see where the strength in the economy is ... China and other emerging markets are very strong.” In November, closest rival Adidas AG raised its sales outlook on strong demand in emerging markets, and Puma  said in October China and Latin America contributed most to overall sales growth. But for Nike, futures orders rose 16 percent even in the United States, and were up in all other markets except for Japan. “The brand continues to show very strong demand... the strength is just impressive, helping propel the stock higher,” Matt Arnold, consumer discretionary analyst for Edward Jones, said. The Beaverton, Oregon-based company saw margins drop 260 basis points as costs of labor and raw materials rose, but came in more or less in line with what most analysts had expected. “Margins were pretty consistent with what we were looking for. Any time you see a brand that is witnessing this type of demand, it gives you confidence that over time pricing will be able to catch up with input costs and labour costs,” Arnold said. For the second quarter ended Nov. 30, the world’s biggest sports clothing maker earned $469 million, or $1 a share, compared with $457 million, while analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of 97 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The RFU gave no financial details of the four-year agreement, which media reports suggested was worth more than 5 million pounds ($7.98 million) a year, but said it was the largest kit partnership in the Union’s history. Canterbury, bought by British retailer JD Sports Fashion in 2009, has previously supplied shirts to the All Blacks, Australia and Ireland and is currently kit supplier to South Africa and Scotland. Nike began their partnership with the RFU in 1983. RFU chief commercial officier Sophie Goldschmidt told reporters that Nike had been keen to continue their relationship and there had been in-depth discussions before the decision was made to go with Canterbury. “It ended very amicably,” she added in a conference call. The new deal comes with former champions England recovering from a dismal World Cup in New Zealand last year and rebuilding for the next tournament that they will host in 2015. “We are excited about the future,” Canterbury Chief executive Chris Stephenson told reporters. “From what we’ve seen in the Six Nations so far, the team look re-energised.” Mobile phone company O2 extended their sponsorship with England for a further four years earlier this month in a deal that they said was bigger than previous agreements.",3022012,http://www.reuters.com/article/rugby-canterbury/rugby-canterbury-replaces-nike-as-rfu-kit-supplier-idUSL4E8E24OW20120302
50,NKE,"In China, Apple faces its ""Nike moment""?","BEIJING (Reuters) - As Apple Inc, the world’s most valuable listed company, braces itself for a report into alleged poor working conditions among its army of low-cost suppliers in China, it could heed the lessons from another big-brand retailer that faced similar issues two decades ago. “Apple is facing its ‘Nike moment’,” said Teresa Cheng, international campaign coordinator for United Students Against Sweatshops (USAS), referring to accusations in the 1990s that suppliers to sportswear retailer Nike Inc mistreated workers. Such is the California-based iPad and iPhone maker’s dominance of the technology sector that its response to the non-profit Fair Labor Association’s (FLA) report - expected this week - could affect conditions across China’s vast electronics supply chain. Nike was battered in the media and by public opinion because its suppliers in Asia forced employees to work long hours without breaks, and paid them a pittance without benefits. The company’s response - and what some say are the mistakes it made - could offer a roadmap for Apple, which has faced similar bad press following deaths and reports of suicides at its China supply firms. Three workers at Foxconn Technology Co Ltd died in a blast last year when dust from polishing iPads ignited, and labor rights groups have said 18 workers at Foxconn sites killed themselves, or tried to, in 2010. The vast majority of Foxconn’s 1.2 million employees are involved in assembling Apple products, according to media reports. Apple hired teams from the FLA to interview 35,000 workers at three of Foxconn’s sprawling factories, which put together iPads and iPhones as well as gadgets for other well-known brands. The FLA’s interim report into Apple’s suppliers based on those anonymous interviews over the past three weeks could mirror a number of the issues that Nike faced. “Trouble in your supply chain can really hurt your reputation globally, extremely rapidly,” said Kenneth Lieberthal, director of the Brookings Institution’s China center and author of ‘Managing the China Challenge: How to Achieve Corporate Success in the People’s Republic.’. “The wisdom in the industry from that (Nike) experience is that you have to do a lot of work to be sure you understand what is happening in your supply chain.” In the early 1990s, when media and activists began reporting on conditions at Nike’s suppliers in Asia and central America, the company brought in wide-ranging reforms designed to eradicate worker maltreatment, and later opened those operations to inspection. It wrote a code of conduct for contractors, requiring them to provide workplaces free of harassment and abuse. Contractors cannot employ underage workers, must pay at least the minimum wage, and provide a clear accounting in writing for every pay period, with no deductions for disciplinary infractions. Rules also govern overtime and days off. Nike also engaged its critics. “The most significant shift for Nike was when we began to sit down with the very people who had been critical of us and started to engage not in a denial conversation but in a conversation on how to solve the problems,” said Hannah Jones, Nike’s vice president of sustainable business and innovation. But some problems, and criticism, persist. Last year, one of Nike’s contractors in Indonesia agreed to pay more than 4,400 workers $1 million after complaints they were forced to work overtime without payment. When problems are identified, they are addressed, said Jones. Some problems, however, can slip through. “We don’t have loopholes in our processes, but you’re talking about 1,000 or so factories just for Nike, in 52 countries with about 1 million workers in them,” Jones said in an interview this week. By hiring the FLA to inspect its factories, Apple is taking a leaf from Nike’s book. Such monitoring, however, should only be a first step, said Richard Locke, head of the political science department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has researched the supply chains of Nike and Apple rival Hewlett-Packard. “(Auditing) assumes the problem is (that) there are bad managers who need to be policed more frequently,” which is generally not the case, said Locke. Instead, the problem is staff insufficiently trained to run complex operations, and brands and retailers making unreasonable demands of suppliers. “Where you see suppliers ... working with the brands, you see both improvements on the business side and improvements on the labor side,” he said. “Suddenly, you don’t need excess overtime because you’re running a good operation. Your margins are higher, and you can afford to pay people a little better.” Foxconn has said it was raising salaries by 16-25 percent, and last month was advertising a basic monthly wage, not including overtime, of 1,800 yuan ($290) in Shenzhen, Guangdong province - where the monthly minimum wage is 1,500 yuan. Apple stresses its partners are required to adhere to strict global standards. “We insist our suppliers provide safe working conditions, (and) treat workers with dignity and respect,” said spokeswoman Carolyn Wu. “Our suppliers must live up to these requirements if they want to keep doing business with Apple.” But if Nike’s experience is any guide, Apple can expect close scrutiny for years to come. “Unless we hold Apple’s feet to the fire, they’re going to get away with profiting off the same sweatshop conditions and driving a global race to the bottom while fooling the public and making it look like they’re getting better, just like Nike did,” Cheng at USAS said in emailed comments. “The Nike and Apple experiences, although in two different industries, are one and the same.” ",3062012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-china/in-china-apple-faces-its-nike-moment-idUSTRE8250FQ20120306
51,NKE,"UPDATE 3-Nike sees strong demand, better margins in spring","* Q3 EPS $1.20 versus Wall Street $1.17 * Q3 sales rise 15 percent to $5.8 billion * Futures orders up 15 percent * Shares rise about 1 pct after the bell March 22 (Reuters) - Nike Inc headed into the spring quarter with strong demand and improving margin trends, as the top sporstwear retailer forecast a strong year with plans to cash in on the Olympics. The Beaverton, Oregon-based company saw futures orders for delivery from March through July rise 15 percent even as rival Adidas expects a slowdown in sales growth in 2012. Futures orders, which indicate demand, are a closely-watched metric for Nike products. On a conference call with analysts, the company was upbeat about its prospects for the upcoming Olympics and European Championship, somewhat in contrast to Adidas, which disappointed investors when it stuck to forecasts for a slowdown in sales growth in 2012. “The running category continues to post strong results as we head into the home stretch of the fiscal year. Road races are seeing capacity levels and we are heading into the Summer Olympics,” Charlie Denson, president of the Nike Brand said on a conference call with analysts. Apart from the Olympics, the big sportswear brands are courting soccer fans ahead of the UEFA European championships in Poland and Ukraine that starts in June. “Nike has a very strong product cycle within the running category, which is pretty much the largest category in footwear,” said Matt Arnold, consumer discretionary analyst for Edward Jones. “It is about lightweight running, not just any running, and Nike was pretty much at the forefront of creating that category.	 So not only did they start the product cycle, they are harnessing it to the full potential,” he said. Nike has posted eight consecutive quarters of double-digit sales growth in the running category. Shares of the company rose to $112.01 in late trading after closing at $110.99 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. Nike earned $560 million, or $1.20 a share for the third quarter ended Feb. 29, compared with $523 million, or $1.08 a share last year. Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $1.17 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 15 percent to $5.8 billion, with a 17 percent rise in North America, its biggest market. Margins at the company, which have been under pressure from high product costs, fell 2 percentage points. But that was better than the 2.6 percentage point drop in the second quarter. Nike said it expects margins to be down 1 percentage point in the current quarter. “Investors are looking at stabilization over the next couple of quarters,” Edward Jones analyst Arnold said. Arnold added that as in-store prices increase, comparisons ease and costs moderate, Nike should be able to stabilize margins soon. “There is clearly not a demand issue here, so if they could get margins to point at the same direction as revenue, we could see more acceleration of earnings from here,” he said.",3222012,http://www.reuters.com/article/nike/update-3-nike-sees-strong-demand-better-margins-in-spring-idUSL1E8EM9CS20120322

56,NKE,UPDATE 2-'Tebow-Mania' spurs Nike lawsuit against Reebok,"* Nike says it, not Reebok, has rights to Tebow apparel * Seeks damages from sales of “unauthorized” apparel By Grant McCool NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - Nike Inc is accusing Reebok of trying to score an illegal Tim Tebow marketing touchdown. Nike sued its rival in U.S. District Court, saying that Reebok used the popular NFL quarterback’s name and number on New York Jets iconic green T-shirts without its permission. Tebow was traded to the Jets from the Denver Broncos last week. Reebok, says Nike, is trying to capitalize on “short-lived intense consumer appetite for such products.” Tebow has drawn attention not only as a top athlete, but for open displays of his evangelical Christian faith on the playing field. The pose he assumes has come to be known as “Tebowing.” His Broncos No. 15 jersey was among the top selling in the National Football League. He left Denver after it signed star quarterback Peyton Manning, who had played for the Indianapolis Colts. Nike said it is authorized and licensed to use Tebow’s name on football-related products. It is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages from Reebok. A spokeswoman for Adidas AG, the parent of Reebok, declined to comment on the lawsuit. The complaint was dated Tuesday and made public on Wednesday. The complaint also accused Reebok of undermining an event scheduled for April 3 in New York to mark Nike’s five-year deal as the league’s exclusive provider of on-field clothing and shoes for all 32 NFL teams. Nike said there are only two ways to acquire the right to use an NFL player’s name and number on merchandise — by obtaining the rights directly from the player or by entering a so-called “group license” with NFL Players Inc, the licensing arm of the NFL Players Association, the players’ union. Nike said it has a license with the players as well as the union and that Reebok never had an agreement with Tebow individually, “nor did it obtain his permission to or consent to the manufacture of Tebow Jets product.” Reebok had a license with the players’ union, but it expired before March 1, the complaint said. Nike said that license applied only to Denver Broncos apparel and Tebow did not become a Jets player until March 21. A Tebow representative wrote to Reebok on March 23, demanding that it discontinue using his name and remove the products from all locations, the lawsuit said.

57,NKE,"UPDATE 1-""Tebow-Mania"" in New York produces a lawsuit","* Nike sues Reebok accusing rival of misappropriation * Seeks damages, profits from “unauthorized” apparel By Grant McCool March 28 (Reuters) - When Reebok introduced a green New York Jets T-shirt with the number 15 and star National Football League quarterback Tim Tebow’s name on it last week, Nike Inc  says its rival was misappropriating Nike’s rights. In a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York, Nike accused Reebok of taking unfair advantage of “Tebow-Mania” — the phenomenon surrounding the quarterback who moved to the Jets from the Denver Broncos. Tebow has drawn attention across the United States not just as a sportsman, but for his open displays of his evangelical faith on the field. Reebok, a unit of Adidas AG, “has no authorization from Mr. Tebow or anyone else to use Mr. Tebow’s name or other identification on such Jets product,” said the lawsuit, dated March 27 and made public on Wednesday. Nike said it is authorized and licensed to use Tebow’s name on football-related products. A spokeswoman for Adidas declined to comment on the lawsuit. Nike seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages from Reebok, but makes it clear it wants the profits from sales of the Tebow apparel. “Reebok has taken upon itself to illegitimately seize on this unique and short-lived consumer opportunity,” Nike’s lawsuit said. The Adidas unit was producing and selling Tebow identified Jets apparel products “in order to capitalize on the public’s short-lived intense consumer appetite for such products, and to prevent Nike from doing so.” It said there are only two ways to acquire the right to use an NFL player’s name and number on merchandise — by obtaining the right directly from the player or by entering a so-called “group license” with NFL Players Inc, the licensing arm of the NFL Players Association, the players’ union.

The order issued late on Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel prevents Reebok from manufacturing, selling and shipping the alleged unauthorized apparel for the National Football League team and bearing Tebow’s name. It also requires Reebok to offer to buy back such apparel from retailers and recall the products from shipping channels. The Denver Broncos traded Tebow to the Jets on March 21. Castel, however, rejected Nike’s demand that Reebok destroy any unauthorized Tebow products. The judge set an April 4 hearing to discuss whether the ban should be extended. Nike filed the lawsuit on Tuesday. Reebok is a unit of Germany’s Adidas AG. Daniel Sarro, a Reebok spokesman, said the company plans to refute Nike’s contentions at the hearing, “which should enable the court to change its view.” Paul Sarkozi, a lawyer for Nike, declined to comment. Nike spokeswoman Kellie Leonard did not immediately return a telephone call seeking a comment. According to the complaint, on April 1, Nike will begin an exclusive five-year contract with the NFL to sell uniforms and related apparel for all 32 teams. Nike also said Reebok has no current agreement to sell Tebow-related Jets products and that a Reebok merchandising license with the NFL players union expired prior to this month. It accused Reebok of trying to capitalize on “short-lived intense consumer appetite for such products,” and selling products bearing Tebow’s name without the player’s consent. Tebow’s No. 15 Broncos uniform had been among the NFL’s top-selling jerseys before his trade to the Jets. Apparel sales for a popular player who changes teams customarily soar in the first few days after the change. Nike’s lawsuit does not concern Broncos products bearing Tebow’s name and those made before March 1.

Along with larger rivals Nike and Adidas, Puma had enjoyed a strong end to 2011 and analysts said they were surprised by the results, with sales, margins and profits all missing average forecasts. “In comparison with Adidas and Nike, they’ve been weak on the product innovation front. They’ve got a lot of catching up to do, especially in terms of getting back to the desirability that the brand enjoyed in the 1990s,” BHF Bank analyst Peter Steiner said. The group said sales rose only 6.1 percent in euro terms in the quarter, compared with almost 16 percent in the fourth quarter. Sales in Europe, which accounts for around 43 percent of turnover, dropped 1.7 percent in euro terms. Chief Executive Franz Koch said the group would continue to invest in new products this year and expected a return to earnings growth from the second quarter. While Nike and Adidas have enjoyed double-digit sales growth in China, where increasingly affluent and fashion-conscious customers have been snapping up European and American brands, Puma on Wednesday described its performance there as “mediocre” in the first quarter. Koch said Puma saw sales growth of less than 10 percent in China in the first quarter, compared with high double-digit rates in India, Korea and Japan. “It’s to do with the overall market environment, it’s flooded with inventory from local competitors,” Koch told reporters. Local rivals include Li Ning, ANTA Sports , and Goldrooster, which plans to list in Frankfurt to drive its expansion. Koch said Puma would focus on lifestyle, running and training products in China, and that it hoped the group’s motorsport products would do well there, given the interest of Chinese consumers in brands like Ferrari, BMW and Mercedes. Puma, controlled by French luxury goods group PPR, also said it had found the footwear market challenging in the first quarter, with sales down 2 percent. The running category in particular is enjoying a resurgence, however, and is dominated by trends coming out of the United States, such as lightweight shoes, a section of the market virtually created by Nike. Koch said he was hopeful for the new Archive Light shoe that has just hit the shops in the United States and added that Puma intended to launch a new performance footwear line in 2013. “We want to focus further on the running and training category in the U.S.,” he said. “It’s something we’ve been addressing but it will take us time to reconnect with those consumers.” Overall, Puma saw net earnings drop 5 percent to 74 million euros ($97.7 million), missing forecasts for 77.6 million in a Reuters poll, on sales of 820.9 million. Puma stuck to its outlook for 2012, however, saying new products and moves to make its European operations more efficient would help it to achieve sales growth of between 5 and 9 percent and a mid single-digit percentage rise in net profit. Its shares, which are trading ex-dividend on Wednesday, were up 0.1 percent at 1023 GMT, compared with a 1.9 percent rise in the German mid-cap index.",4252012,http://www.reuters.com/article/puma-results/update-2-european-slowdown-hits-puma-q1-results-idUSL6E8FP0IW20120425

PacSun shares were up 22 percent in extended trade. They closed at $1.18 on Thursday on the Nasdaq. Lackluster merchandise and other missteps have resulted in a continued fall in sales at PacSun for about a year, leading the company to combat an identity crisis. The retailer would focus on its turnaround strategy by delivering “trend-right” products, Chief Executive Gary Schoenfeld said on a conference call with analysts. PacSun has struggled to lure customers away from teen apparel chains like Aeropostale Inc, American Eagle Outfitters Inc and Urban Outfitters. Rival Zumiez, on the other hand, has established a loyal customer base and outdid its peers by expanding its higher-margin portfolio. PacSun intends to broaden the range of price points across different categories, CEO Schoenfeld said. “We look forward to adding higher price point Nike Signature products for back-to-school to further propel this part of our business,” Schoenfeld said. He added that Oakley had also relaunched its branded sunglasses at price points in excess of $150. The company expects gross margins for the second quarter to be in the range of 24 percent to 26 percent, being at or above last year’s overall gross margin. This would primarily be driven by merchandise margins. 1ST-QTR BEATS STREET The surf- and skate-related products retailer’s loss from continuing operations narrowed to $15.6 million, or 23 cents per share, from $28.7 million, or 43 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding items, it posted a loss of 20 cents per share. Sales at the company, which started as a small surf shop in southern California in 1980, rose marginally to $173.8 million. Same-store sales increased 1 percent. Rival Zumiez also reported earnings ahead of estimates on improved margins. For the second quarter, the company expects to lose 11 to 16 cents per share.

71,NKE,Olympics-WADA ready to seek help from corporate world,"QUEBEC CITY, May 23 (Reuters) - Corporations that benefit from clean sport could soon be asked to contribute to the anti-doping effort as funding for the fight against performance-enhancing drugs gets tighter, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) said on Wednesday. As a global financial crisis drags on, WADA admits that backing anti-doping efforts could be viewed as a luxury item that governments - which contribute half of the organisation’s $28 million budget - can no longer afford. “Certainly there have been discussions about finding other sources of revenue,” WADA spokesman Terence O’Rourke told Reuters. “At our recent Foundation Board meeting there was a general agreement to start exploring other avenues of funding.” WADA could seek help from corporate giants such as Nike, a company that has strong ties to high-profile athletes and uses them to market and develop products that generate billions of dollars in profit. Nike has not yet been involved in the anti-doping effort but has shown some corporate social responsibility supporting dozens of agreements on a national and international level, including 14 basketball and 11 athletics federations. Nike brand president Charlie Denson, keynote speaker at the SportAccord convention on Wednesday, told Reuters the company has not been approached by any anti-doping agencies but said the world’s top sporstwear retailer would listen to proposals. “I’m not familiar with their proposal or how or what they are looking at but we are always open to engaging in that conversation,” Denson told Reuters. “We’ve taken a pretty strong stance on doping and performance enhancing drugs situation. Obviously we have severed several relationships over the years. “We would sit down and listen to what their approach and proposal is and we would be willing to do that and go from there.” Nike, which earned $560 million for the third quarter ended Feb. 29 while revenue rose 15 percent to $5.8 billion, has a large fan base in America where the company’s product launches are met with extreme enthusiasm. Rivals like Adidas and Puma have long been trying to mirror Nike’s U.S. popularity but have not met the same success. WADA would like to see Nike and other companies step up and make small contributions to an anti-doping effort that it says is being stretched to the limit. “We could always use significantly more money but we recognise the world is a tough place to find money these days from sport and governments,” said WADA chief John Fahey. “Whatever it is we will work within that budget but if we can get more money I have no doubt we could be far more effective.” Nike, who endorses hundreds of athletes, is among the companies that have been stung by drug cheats. But despite ties to disgraced athletes such as former Olympic sprinter Marion Jones, the Nike brand has remain untainted. “It’s our goal and challenge to continue to supply the best,” explained Denson. “The good comes with the bad and hopefully the good outweighs the bad.”	 	  (Reporting by Steve Keating in Quebec City)",5232012,http://www.reuters.com/article/olympics-doping-corporate/olympics-wada-ready-to-seek-help-from-corporate-world-idUSL4E8GN8MF20120523

74,NKE,UPDATE 2-Nike looking to sell Cole Haan and Umbro brands,"* Says time is right to look for buyer * Nike rivals most likely buyers - analyst May 31 (Reuters) - Nike Inc is looking for a buyer for its Cole Haan and Umbro brands in order to focus on its core namesake, Jordan, Converse and Hurley brands, the company said on Thursday. The process will begin immediately and be completed by the end of May 2013, Nike said. “Nike is ... looking at its business to understand where to invest and prioritize. It is now time to seek a buyer for Umbro and Cole Haan to further focus ... on driving growth in the Nike brand, Jordan, Converse and Hurley,” the company said in an email to Reuters. In April, smaller rival sportswear group Adidas  of Germany said it planned to slash the number of products it offers by a quarter to improve profitability. The company is the market leader in the soccer category and has forecast sales of soccer-related products this year of more than 1.5 billion euros. Nike said its decision to sell the Cole Haan and Umbro brands was not a reaction to Adidas’ move and that it would give out details on the financial impact of the move when it announces financial results on June 28. “It is too early for us to estimate the impact of these transactions,” the company said in the email. Beaverton, Oregon-based Nike is the top sportswear company in the world and anticipates strong demand for its swoosh-marked clothing and shoes. However, there have been concerns about margins as sales have not been able to offset rising prices of materials including cotton, plastic and fuel. Most of Nike’s sales come from its namesake brand. The Jordan, Converse and Hurley brands, which also sell sports and casual wear, are seen as natural complements to the core Nike line. Morningstar analyst Paul Swinand said it was likely the Cole Haan and Umbro brands would be picked up by Nike rivals rather than by private equity. He said Cole Haan would make a good fit for a company like Wolverine World Wide Inc. He said of Nike’s move, “To me, it’s a mild positive. (It says) Nike doesn’t need side brands and they get better returns from the core Nike brand.” Rivals Adidas and Puma declined to comment on whether they would be interested in buying Manchester, England-based Umbro, which makes soccer shoes. Nike acquired New York-based Cole Haan, which specializes in leather shoes and bags, in 1988. It acquired Umbro in 2008.

78,NKE,Soccer stakes rise as Nike presses on Adidas' turf,"(Reuters) - When Germany faces Portugal at the Euro 2012 soccer championship on Saturday, another battle is playing out between sponsors Nike Inc (NKE.N) and Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE) for the top spot in selling gear for the world’s most popular sport. The Portuguese team’s Nike-sponsored red jerseys, set against the white Adidas jerseys worn by Germany, underscore how much headway Nike has made against Adidas, once the dominant brand for all things soccer. Adidas has been associated with soccer (called football outside North America) since the German company was founded in 1949. Nike, whose roots date back to the 1960s, did not enter the soccer business until 1994. Two years later, it scored an impressive goal when it signed Brazil’s national team to a sponsorship deal. “The Brazil deal gave presence and profile. It was also a signal of strategic intent,” said Simon Chadwick, professor of sports business strategy and marketing at Coventry University Business School in Coventry, England. Since then, the Beaverton, Oregon-based Nike has spent heavily on marketing. It also sponsors popular teams and players, including Portugal forward Cristiano Ronaldo. The most recent sponsorship battles between Adidas and Nike were fought over the German and French national soccer teams. Adidas managed to keep its home team, but France was won over by the money Nike offered, which was reportedly north of 300 million euros ($374.01 million). By comparison, Nike’s deal with Brazil in 1996 was worth 100 million pounds. As the top sportswear brand in the world, Nike has been investing in soccer to increase its international presence. Soccer has about 2 billion fans worldwide, followed by basketball with 1.2 billion, according to sports research consultancies REPUCOM and SPORT+MARKT. Companies sponsor popular teams and players to market their products in the hope of influencing fans. Sporting events like the UEFA Euro 2012 can boost sales of soccer merchandise by about 5 percent, according to Morningstar analyst Paul Swinand. Sales of soccer goods will top 4 billion euros in 2012, according to Peter Rohlmann at German consulting firm PR Marketing. He estimates Adidas’ market share at 38 percent, with Nike closing in quickly at 36 percent. Some experts say Adidas is defending not just its merchandise sales against Nike, but also trying to safeguard its history and prestige in the sports world. “Nike is really making a concerted effort to grow in the international market. If you want to be an international player, you’ve got to have a strong soccer business,” said Matt Powell, analyst for SportsOneSource, based in Charlotte, North Carolina. “It is really hard to measure the dollar value of sales against these events. It is much more about branding and credibility,” he added. Adidas said it expects to sell more than 1.5 billion euros ($1.87 billion) of soccer-related gear in 2012, helped by the Euro 2012 championship. Adidas stripes will be seen on six of the 16 teams taking part: reigning champions Spain, plus Ukraine, Denmark, Germany, Greece and Russia. Nike, with annual sales of more than $20 billion, said it had $1.8 billion in sales from soccer in fiscal 2011. The Nike swoosh will be on five teams: Portugal, France, the Netherlands, Croatia and Poland. Nike unit Umbro - a brand the company is planning to sell off - will outfit three teams: England, Sweden and Ireland. Puma (PUMG.DE) has two teams: Italy and the Czech Republic. Experts say Adidas has an edge over Nike in Europe because of its partnerships with soccer governing body FIFA and popular clubs like Real Madrid or Bayern Munich. “In European markets, there are still preconceptions that Adidas is historically associated with football and Nike isn’t,” said Chadwick, but he added: “Over the next 10 years, conceivably we will see Nike overtake Adidas.” Adidas football marketing manager Michael Kresser said last month the company aims to bring at least one product innovation to the soccer market each year. “We are market leaders and we will do everything to maintain that position,” he said in an interview. Nike has its plans in place as well. “There is a relentless drive for bringing in new products,” said Charlie Brooks, Nike’s communications director for football. “Football is massively important. We made a strategic decision in 1994 that if we are going to be the world’s leading sports brand, we need to lead in football,” Brooks said. Andreas Ullmann, head of market intelligence at SPORT+MARKT, expects about 7 million replica jerseys to be sold for Euro 2012, which alone guarantees retail sales of at least 500 million euros ($623.35 million). Nike has worked toward being a global brand that “has its finger on the pulse of football,” Ullman said. Still, he noted that Adidas is an established rival and is often better-connected, making it difficult for Nike to overtake the German company. “I don’t think Nike can do anything in football other than what it is already doing, other than continuing to invest in it to keep building its equity and tell fans it’s in it for a long term. It is not just about money, it is about passion for football,” said Coventry Business School’s Chadwick.

The potential value of Umbro, which sources said is likely to be a tougher sale, could not be learned. Potential acquirers for Cole Haan could include footwear company Wolverine Worldwide, branded apparel company, VF Corp and luxury houses LVMH and Richemont. Private equity firms that have historically invested in the retail sector such as Golden Gate Capital, Leonard Green and Sycamore Partners could also take a look, the sources said. VF, LVMH, Richemont, Leonard Green and Sycamore Partners could not be reached for a comment. Wolverine and Golden Gate Capital declined to comment. Nike purchased Umbro, a soccer gear company, in 2008 for $565 million but has had problems with the brand. In fiscal 2009, Nike recognized a $401.3 million pretax impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of Umbro. South Korean clothing company E-land and sportswear company Fila could consider Umbro, the sources said. E-land could not be reached for a comment. Fila declined to comment. Nike has said it will complete the sales process of both brands by June 2013. The company is looking to shed non-core assets as it focuses on its namesake brand, as well as Jordan, Converse and Hurley.",6142012,http://www.reuters.com/article/nike-sale/nike-kicks-off-cole-haan-umbro-auction-process-sources-idUSL1E8HDEN320120614
83,NKE,"RPT-Olympics-Nike, Adidas lead suppliers' battle for gold","By Victoria Bryan and Keith Weir HERZOGENAURACH, Germany/LONDON, June 20 (Reuters) - U.S. market leader Nike and German rival Adidas  are locked in their own Olympic battle to boost athletes’ performance and squeeze maximum value out of next month’s Games in London. The Games provide a showcase for new fashions and advances in technology which sportswear suppliers hope will drive sales at a time of economic turmoil in many of their markets. Unlike soccer’s World Cup, Olympic venues carry no perimeter advertising, making the suppliers of kit and shoes the most visible brands when the eyes of the world are on the Games. “This puts the likes of Nike, Adidas and Puma firmly in the spotlight in the most emotionally-charged moments,” said Danny Townsend, president EMEA and South Asia at brand analysis company Repucom. “Endorsement deals with athletes who are likely to gain substantial coverage, such as Usain Bolt or Jessica Ennis, pack an immense punch,” he added. “Our projections from the Beijing Games indicate around 3.6 billion people worldwide saw at least some TV coverage which gives a strong indicator to the power of this presence. This level of brand exposure is a potent force in driving sales.” Jamaican triple gold medallist Bolt is the poster boy for Germany’s Puma, the third largest sporting goods company behind local rival Adidas. “The Olympics is probably the biggest platform you can have as a sport brand. With Usain Bolt running the 100 metres, 200 metres and relays, the whole world will focus on that on TV,” Puma CEO Franz Koch told Reuters. Adidas has invested heavily to be the official sportwear partner of the Games, with tens of thousands of volunteers and Olympic officials to wear its familiar three-stripe outfits. That comes on top of a long-standing deal to provide the kit for a British team which includes heptathlete medal hope Ennis, the photogenic face of the host nation’s squad. “We’re kitting out 5,000 athletes and 84,000 volunteers with 3 million pieces of apparel,” Adidas Olympics head Simon Cartwright told Reuters at the firm’s headquarters in the small German town of Herzogenaurach, which is also home to Puma. Adidas estimates the interest generated by the Games will bring it an extra 100 million pounds ($157 million) of sales in the UK, helping it on its way to overtake rival Nike as market leader there. Cartwright says the situation is similar to that in Beijing, when the Games helped it to top the market there in 2008. “Adidas has got its foot on the accelerator. They’ve thrown down the gauntlet to Nike because they want to take market leadership in the UK. Nike is more focused on Rio (2016),” said a manager in the sports sponsoring industry. Based in Portland, Oregon, Nike remains the global market leader, with annual sales of almost $21 billion against $17 billion for Adidas. Puma, formed in 1948 after brothers fell out at Adidas, is a distant third with sales of $3.8 billion. The top two seem to be pulling away despite the Bolt factor. Nike’s sales jumped 15 percent in the quarter to end-February, while Adidas reported a 14 percent rise in the first three months of the year. Puma managed only a six percent increase, trailing its larger rivals in Europe, China and the United States. Nike, which sponsors the U.S Olympic team, says the Games give it the chance to build a buzz around its products. “Its like a concept car model - we get to debut these innovations on the world’s best athletes, then commercialise the opportunity by providing those technologies to athletes everywhere,” said Nike UK head of PR and communications Ryan Greenwood. For its part, Adidas has made 41 different shoes that will be worn by athletes competing in 25 disciplines. The one thing they all have in common is their weight, they are on average 25 percent lighter than the equivalent shoes worn in Beijing. “Every 100 grammes saved in weight is equivalent to 1 percent better performance,” Cartwright said. The group has also created what it calls the lightest ever sprint spike, at 99 grammes. “It’s so advanced we can’t make that many of them,” Cartwright said. Nike too is promoting ultra-light shoes and a running uniform featuring special patches which reduce the aerodynamic drag on an athlete, an idea taken from the dimples that help golf balls to fly further. After exhaustive wind tunnel testing, it claims it can cut up to .023 seconds off times in the 100 metres - what it says can be the difference between winning a medal and missing out. Behind Puma, Japan’s Asics is the number four in the sector and positions itself as a supplier of premium products for everyone from elite marathon runners down to regular joggers. The company plans to open a new flagship store on London’s Oxford Street just before the Games begin on July 27. Below those four are a cluster of smaller suppliers, including some from fast growing nations like Russia and China. Russia’s privately owned Bosco is the kit supplier to the Spanish team and has opened a store in the new shopping centre on the edge of the Olympic park. China’s Li Ning Co Ltd. came to prominence at Beijing in 2008 when its eponymous founder, a former Olympic gymnast, had the honour of lighting the Olympic cauldron. However, growing competition from Nike and Adidas in China is squeezing it and other local producers. Li Ning suffered a setback this month when it issued a profit warning and its shares fell to a 6-1/2 year low. China’s ANTA Sports Products Ltd has also said it faces a challenging year because of rising costs and intense competition. “It would take a monumental shift in the global sports apparel environment to impact on the dominance of Nike and Adidas,” said Repucom’s Townsend. “I think where we could see the real jostling in the coming years is in the second tier, below the big two,” he added. The Games are not just about the performance, they are also about making sure athletes look good and the top brands have been working with big name designers for this year’s Games. By an odd coincidence, Adidas and Puma have opted for daughters of famous musicians. Adidas has had a long partnership with Stella McCartney, whose father Paul McCartney is expected to perform at the opening ceremony. Cedella Marley, daughter of reggae icon Bob Marley, has designed the Jamaican kit for Puma. “Each of our teams have a unique design,” Cartwright said, explaining how Adidas has tried to incorporate national symbols into the kits for countries like Germany, France and Australia. “The young Germans are a bit happier to wave the flag and be more patriotic so we have an eagle design.” While the Team GB kits has divided opinion in the UK, with some seeing them as too blue, Cartwright shrugs off the critics. “It was in the media for two days,” indicating how any publicity is good publicity. Puma meanwhile plundered the history books to draw inspiration for its running vests for the Jamaican team. The yellow vests will feature the faces of Arthur Wint, who in London in 1948 became the first Jamaican to win a gold medal, and team mate Herb McKenley, who finished second behind him. “We want to hear people say, ‘Ooh, what’s that?’ We want to be different, unusual,” Puma CEO Koch told Reuters.",6202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/oly-brands-battle/rpt-olympics-nike-adidas-lead-suppliers-battle-for-gold-idUSL3E8HK22520120620

86,NKE,UPDATE 2-Adidas ups 2012 soccer goal as German shirts fly,"* Expects 2012 soccer sales above 1.6 bln euros * More than one million German shirts sold * Says has overtaken Nike in Polish soccer market WARSAW, June 21 (Reuters) - Adidas firmly stepped on Nike’s ambitions in the soccer market, raising its forecast for 2012 sales of soccer equipment to a record of more than 1.6 billion euros ($2 billion) as fans rush to snap up boots and Euro 2012 replica shirts. The German group was once the dominant force in the soccer sector but has faced increasing competition from Nike, the world’s largest sporting goods company, which entered the market in 1994. Adidas had previously forecast that sales in the soccer category would be above the 1.5 billion euros it achieved in 2010, boosted by the World Cup finals. “Football is the heart and soul of our company and is what has made Adidas great,” chief executive Herbert Hainer told journalists in Warsaw. “We have gained market share according to all the numbers I have.” Nike achieved soccer sales of $1.8 billion in 2011 and its market share is estimated at 36 percent, against 38 percent for Adidas. Hainer also denied that Adidas, the world’s second-largest sportswear manufacturer, would be interested in buying Umbro, the brand put up for sale by Nike last month. “We are already the market leader in football; we do not need another brand,” he said. Adidas said that the Euro 2012 tournament, being held in Poland and Ukraine, had allowed it to regain market leadership in Poland, even though the Polish national team’s shirts sport the “swoosh” logo of its U.S. rival. Hainer said that was thanks to products such as the Adizero F50 boots worn by Argentina’s Lionel Messi, the the FIFA World Player of the Year, as well as its network of own retail stores across the country. Among the Adidas soccer bestsellers are Germany replica shirts with more than one million of them finding their way into shoppers’ bags already, making it the most popular European championships shirt the company has sold. Fans are also snapping up replica match balls, with the group expecting to sell more than seven million this year, and soccer vice president Markus Baumann said the group was on course for record sales of boots, too. Hainer said he was surprised by the popularity of the Germany retro-styled green away shirt and the Spanish shirt. “We have sold close to one million jerseys already and we know the economic situation in Spain is not the best,” he said. Of the six teams sporting Adidas’s trademark three stripes at Euro 2012, only Spain, Germany and Greece have made it to the quarter-finals. Hainer, a keen soccer player as well as a fan, said he wanted a Spain-Germany final. “These two teams are still my favourites. It would be a great repetition of the 2008 final,” he said. Adidas made headlines earlier this week when it cancelled the release of a sneaker model after a public outcry over plastic orange shackles attached to the heels. Separately, a New York man sued a unit of Adidas, claiming he was misled about the potential fitness benefits of shoes designed to mimic the effect of running barefoot. Adidas shares were down 0.8 percent at 58.55 euros by 1238 GMT.",6212012,http://www.reuters.com/article/adidas-soccer/update-2-adidas-ups-2012-soccer-goal-as-german-shirts-fly-idUSL5E8HL7G120120621

The cartel office did not say who had made the complaints about the internet sales restriction but only affected parties may complain to the watchdog, meaning it is likely to be retailers who are no longer receiving stock.

92,NKE,"Nike profit hit by costs, shares fall","(Reuters) - Nike Inc (NKE.N) missed quarterly profit estimates for the first time in at least two years as higher spending and increased costs of materials used in its shoes and T-shirts hurt margins, while demand eased in international markets. The results sent shares of the world’s largest sportswear maker down nearly 13 percent in extended trading on Thursday. Orders of Nike branded shoes and clothes scheduled for delivery from June through November, a closely-watched metric of demand known as “futures orders” rose 7 percent. That is less than half of the rise of futures orders in the fiscal third quarter. In the fourth quarter that ended May 31, futures orders rose only 5 percent in Greater China, down from a 24 percent increase a year earlier, a sign that even the popular Nike “swoosh” is not immune to slowing global economic growth. Analysts and investors have been worried about a cooling in demand as footwear trends typically last about two to three years. Nike has been hot in the running shoe market for almost two and a half years now, said Morningstar analyst Paul Swinand. The company earned $549 million, or $1.17 cents a share, in its fourth quarter, compared with $594 million, or $1.24 a share, a year ago. Analysts, on average, had been expecting the company to earn $1.37 share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 12 percent to $6.5 billion. Gross margins fell 1.5 percentage points in the fourth quarter and have been declining for more than a year. “While we had expected some gross margins decline and some increase in spending with the Olympics and soccer championships, both are higher than expected,” said Swinand. Swinand also said the drop in the share price could be a chance for investors to buy shares of the company, as he did not think the company has any flaws in execution. Matt Arnold, consumer discretionary analyst for Edward Jones, saw improvement ahead for Nike. “Margins will eventually become better and they have already taken pricing actions, so in general we think it is a matter of time. Nike is a strong brand with a lot going right for it,” said Arnold. Nike’s finance chief, Don Blair, said higher input costs were the primary reason for the profit drop in the quarter. Higher prices and lower air freight expenses helped mitigate the rising materials costs. The company also said it had more inventory than desired in China and Western Europe, raising questions about how much it would have to discount in those regions to clear off merchandise. “There’s inventory that’s been piling up for quite a few quarters ...that can take a few quarters,” said Canaccord Genuity analyst Camilo Lyon. Shares of Nike, based in Beaverton, Oregon, were down 12.9 percent at $84.40 in after-hours trading on Thursday after closing at $96.89 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The results sent shares of the world’s largest sportswear maker down nearly 13 percent in extended trading on Thursday. Orders of Nike branded shoes and clothes scheduled for delivery from June through November, a closely-watched metric of demand known as “futures orders” rose 7 percent. That is less than half of the rise of futures orders in the fiscal third quarter. In the fourth quarter that ended May 31, futures orders rose only 5 percent in Greater China, down from a 24 percent increase a year earlier, a sign that even the popular Nike “swoosh” is not immune to slowing global economic growth.

The auction process, which began earlier this summer, is in the second round with Cole Haan likely to fetch around $500 million, two of the people said. Nike, the world’s biggest athletic shoe and clothing maker, said in May it would look to sell Cole Haan and soccer gear unit Umbro in order to divest non-core assets wh ile focusing on its namesake brand, as well as Jordan, Converse and Hurley. The company, which has said it will complete the sale of both brands by June 2013, has hired Goldman Sachs Group  to run these auctions, sources previously told Reuters. Nike acquired Cole Haan in 1988 for $80 million. Private equity firm TPG already has close ties to the high-end handbag and shoe maker. Matt Rubell, a former chairman and chief executive officer of Cole Haan, is now a senior advisor at the buyout firm. Representatives for TPG and Apax declined to comment. Nike and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Cole Haan is among several footwear companies that have gone on the auction block in recent months. In May, footwear retailer Collective Brands Inc was purchased by a consortium including Wolverine Worldwide Inc , Blum Capital Partners and Golden Gate Capital for about $1.32 billion.

99,NKE,Nike to stand by Lance Armstrong despite fall from grace,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - Nike Inc plans to continue to support Lance Armstrong even after the seven-time Tour de France cycling champion is stripped of his titles for deciding to no longer fight charges of doping, while bicycle maker Trek is analyzing the situation. “Lance has stated his innocence and has been unwavering on this position. Nike plans to continue to support Lance and the Lance Armstrong Foundation, a foundation that Lance created to serve cancer survivors,” Nike said in a prepared statement. Late on Thursday, Armstrong said he would no longer fight allegations from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency that he cheated throughout his career by using performance enhancing drugs. “Enough is enough,” said Armstrong, a cancer survivor considered one of the all-time greats in his sport, in a statement. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency announced it would strip Armstrong of his titles and ban him from competitive cycling. Nike, the world’s biggest sportswear maker, is a longtime supporter of Armstrong and Livestrong, his organization to help cancer survivors and raise money for cancer research. Since 2004, Nike has helped Livestrong raise over $100 million and created the Livestrong yellow wristbands that became a global phenomenon with over 84 million bands distributed. Trek Bicycle Corp has sponsored Armstrong since 1999 and sponsors the Radio Shack Nissan Trek team at the Tour de France. The Wisconsin-based bike company said it is monitoring developments. It has not pulled its sponsorship of Armstrong in the triathlons he has done or other bike rides. Trek also sells Livestrong branded bikes.",8242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/armstrong-sponsors/nike-to-stand-by-lance-armstrong-despite-fall-from-grace-idUSL2E8JO4VV20120824

The five-year agreement will cover English soccer at all levels include the men’s and women’s national teams, as well as amateur and disabled squads, the English Football Association (FA) said on Monday. Nike will also sponsor St George’s Park, the FA’s new national football centre. No financial details were given. Umbro, based in the northern English city of Manchester, had provided the England team kit for most of the last 60 years. Nike said in May it planned to sell it to focus on core brands. Nike, the world’s largest sporting goods company, entered the soccer market in 1994 and now rivals Germany’s Adidas  for top spot. Adidas has a market share of around 38 percent in soccer, against an estimated 36 percent for Nike. The U.S. company is ensuring it holds on to its top partners after the Umbro sale.

101,NKE,"Nike hits China roadblock, shares fall","(Reuters) - Nike Inc’s (NKE.N) posted a 12 percent drop in first-quarter earnings and orders in China for the next several months fell for the first time in three years, choking off what had been a growth engine for the world’s largest sportswear maker. The slumping orders overshadowed earnings that beat analysts’ expectations, sending shares down 3 percent after the market closed on Thursday. “The (Chinese) consumer is becoming more discerning and sophisticated. At the same time the economy seems to be slowing, creating short-time challenges for retailers,” Charlie Denson, president for the Nike brand, said on a conference call with analysts. “It’s a natural evolution we’ve seen in many markets, so we’re not surprised,” he said. Futures orders, or orders of Nike-branded shoes and clothes scheduled for delivery from September 2012 through January 2013, rose 6 percent. In China, futures orders fell 5 percent in the quarter, after rising 27 percent last year. Nike is the latest global company to be hit by the economic slowdown in China, which has hurt demand for everything from tractors to trench coats. Companies like Nike have come to count on China and other emerging markets for rapid growth, compared with mature markets like the United States. “There is a fear, North America is not a growing market, you need China to work,” Rahul Sharma, founder and managing director at retail consultancy Neev Capital, said. However, China is still not Nike’s largest market. He said investors were overreacting to the drop in orders from China which were no surprise. Nike, which already had some excess inventory there, is finding it difficult to tackle intense competition and frequent promotional sales by local brands, while distributors and retailers are wary of the economy. Some analysts said Nike was doing right in not forcing its distributors to take on more orders in a slowing market, rather taking a short-term hit for long-term benefits. Finance Chief Don Blair said the company is working towards aligning its manufacturing volume more tightly with futures orders as it “resets” the market, reiterating that China is a long-term growth opportunity for the company. “The worst thing would be that Nike pressures distributors to pile on stock (to keep futures orders up),” Sharma said. The slumping orders overshadowed earnings that beat analysts’ expectations. For the quarter ended August 31, Nike earned $1.23 a share compared to $1.36 a share last year. Analysts on average forecast $1.12 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income was $567 million, compared with $645 million last year in the same quarter. Revenue rose 10 percent to $6.7 billion, compared with the average analyst estimate of $6.42 billion. Gross margins fell to 43.5 percent from 44.3 percent a year earlier. The rate of decline in gross margins has eased from recent quarters as higher prices for Nike products and cost-cutting have helped mitigate the impact of rising materials and labor costs.

103,NKE,Las Vegas claims new record: world's largest sneaker collection,"LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Las Vegas has a fake Eiffel Tower and a fake Egyptian pyramid, but the Guinness Book of World Records recently confirmed that the city can now lay claim to a new and authentic world record: the world’s largest collection of sneakers. The record keepers at Guinness certified this month that Jordan Michael Geller’s Shoezeum, a shrine to Nike that he says includes one of every model of Air Jordans ever made, holds the record with more than 2,500 pairs, all but eight of which are Nikes. For a $10 ticket, visitors can see Nikes designed to evoke “birds, bees, flowers and trees,” others based on the Simpsons, the Hulk, the Human Torch and even Sesame Street’s Oscar the Grouch, and two pairs of yellow lobster Nikes. Only three dozen of those were made, according to Geller. Geller, 35, said it wasn’t until he finished law and business school degrees at the University of San Diego that he began transforming a childhood fascination with Nike sneakers into a life project. Starting with $300 and more than a dozen credit cards, Geller began a five-year buying and selling spree, hunting down remainders and sales at Nike stores and offering the sneakers on eBay. Along the way, he got hold of some rare Nikes online. Less than a dozen pairs of the shoes at the museum have been worn - but those include a pair that Michael Jordan laced on as a rookie for the Chicago Bulls. The most expensive? A pair made by Converse commemorating the 30th anniversary of Jordan’s 1982 game-winning shot for the University of North Carolina in the NCAA finals. They cost $7,100. Geller began showing his collection out of a San Diego warehouse last year before he decided to hit the road to Las Vegas. Along the way, he felt guided by destiny - including his name, which he said his parents gave him without thinking of Michael Jordan the player. “I would love to give a tour of the museum to Michael Jordan,” he said. “That would be the ultimate dream come true.” He has added another 100 pairs since the Guinness certification in April.

108,NKE,Missile gets makeover on 50th anniversary of Cuban crisis,"* Students restoring 50-year-old Nike missile * Cuban missile crisis a dim memory * Florida missile base now a tourist site By Zachary Fagenson MIAMI, Oct 13 (Reuters) - In October 1962, as fears of mushroom clouds and radioactive fallout gripped the United States in the midst of the Cuban missile crisis, a battery of anti-ballistic missiles near Miami stood as the nation’s first line of defense against nuclear attack. Half a century later the missile base is still there, in the middle of the marshy Everglades, but the missiles are long gone. Now, to mark the 50th anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis, students at a Miami aviation school are restoring one of the original Nike Hercules missiles once tipped with a nuclear warhead and aimed at Cuba. The United States and Cuba remain ideological foes to this day, and Florida is home to tens of thousands of Cubans who fled the island after Fidel Castro’s 1959 revolution, but tensions have cooled down considerably as memories fade. The students realize the decommissioned missile was once part of a historic event but confess to knowing little about one of the momentous episodes of the Cold War. “I just know it was part of the Cuban missile crisis, but I haven’t researched it,” said Abraham Hidalgo, 17, one of the students at George T. Baker Aviation School. The 41-foot (12.5-meter), surface-to-air Nike Hercules missile was previously stored in a U.S. army depot in Alabama, covered in dust and spider webs. A flatbed truck hauled it down Interstate-95 to the school next to Miami International Airport. For the last two months, students have been working to restore the 5-ton missile to near-original condition; sanding wings, replacing sheet metal and repainting the U.S. Army markings. Its final destination is Everglades National Park, where it will be installed at an abandoned Nike missile base. The 13-day missile crisis began on Oct. 16, 1962, when then-President John F. Kennedy first learned the Soviet Union was installing missiles in Cuba, barely 90 miles (145 kms) off the Florida coast. After secret negotiations between Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, the United States agreed not to invade Cuba if the Soviet Union withdrew its missiles from the island. “The irony is a lot of these kids are Cuban,” said George T. Baker principal Sean Gallagan. “And if this missile was used as it was intended a lot of these kids wouldn’t be here.” Samuel Robles, 16, said he didn’t know a lot about the incident but “heard something about Che Guevara on the History Channel,” referring to the Argentine-born revolutionary icon who fought in the 1959 revolution. Military use of the Everglades site ended in 1979 and the facility, known as HM69 Nike Missile Base, was turned over to the National Park Service, which offers visitor tours in the winter months. Because the site lies within a national park, the base is almost unchanged since its closure, including the three missile “barns,” a missile assembly building, barracks and a guard dog kennel. The refurbished Nike Hercules is due to be housed in one of the barns and will be officially unveiled on Oct. 20. During the Cold War the United States was dotted with Nike sites - named after the Greek goddess of victory - strategically located near cities as part of a national air defense system. Most have disappeared or been converted into other public uses, including an immigration detention facility in Florida, a golf course in Illinois and an elementary school in Kansas. Commemoration events marking the anniversary are scheduled around the country, including an exhibition at the National Archives in Washington D.C. titled “To the Brink: JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis,” featuring secretly recorded White House tapes of Kennedy and his advisers as they sought to avert a nuclear war. One of the reasons these anniversaries are important is that “they serve as a flashpoint” for people who don’t remember or weren’t alive, said Graham Allison, director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University. A handful of events are taking place across Miami - an exile home to many of the Cubans who fled communist rule on the island - including a panel discussion at the local history museum and the University of Miami. “I think there was more fear and frenzy here than anywhere because we were so close to it,” said Paul George, a professor at Miami Dade College and historian at the HistoryMiami museum. But the “Kennedy years for students are kind of a dim thing ... I teach history and I see it every day,” he added.

In 1962, there were four Nike missile bases in south Florida, each armed with 18 Hercules missiles ready to intercept a Soviet attack from Cuba, recalled Charles Carter, 66, an Army veteran who served at the bases for three years in the 1960s. “We were the first line of defense the Russians would have had to take out before they could attack the rest of the country,” said Carter, who has spent 10 years working on the restoration project with the help of Everglades park officials.

Since the site lies within a national park, the base is almost unchanged since its closure, including the three missile “barns,” a missile assembly building, barracks and a guard dog kennel. The refurbished Nike Hercules is due to be housed in one of the barns and will be officially unveiled on October 20. Carter hopes to restore some of the buildings as well, including the missile Control Room and the radar towers that kept watch for an attack. During the Cold War, the United States was dotted with Nike sites - named after the Greek goddess of victory - strategically located near cities as part of a national air defense system. Most have disappeared or been converted into other public uses, including an immigration detention facility in Florida, a golf course in Illinois and an elementary school in Kansas. Commemoration events marking the anniversary are scheduled across the country, including an exhibition at the National Archives in Washington titled “To the Brink: JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis,” featuring secretly recorded White House tapes of Kennedy and his advisers as they sought to avert a nuclear war. One of the reasons those anniversaries are important is that “they serve as a flashpoint” for people who do not remember or were not alive, said Graham Allison, director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University. A handful of events are taking place across Miami - an exile home to many of the Cubans who fled communist rule on the island - including a panel discussion at the local history museum and the University of Miami. “I think there was more fear and frenzy here than anywhere because we were so close to it,” said Paul George, a professor at Miami Dade College and historian at the HistoryMiami museum. But the “Kennedy years for students are kind of a dim thing. ... I teach history and I see it every day,” he added.

110,NKE,UPDATE 1-Missile gets makeover on 50th anniversary of Cuban crisis,"* Students restoring 50-year-old Nike missile * Cuban missile crisis a dim memory * Florida missile base now a tourist site   (Adds details and quote from missile base veteran) By Zachary Fagenson MIAMI, Oct 13 (Reuters) - In October 1962, as fears of mushroom clouds and radioactive fallout gripped the United States in the midst of the Cuban missile crisis, a battery of anti-ballistic missiles near Miami stood as the nation’s first line of defense against nuclear attack. Half a century later, the missile base is still there, in the middle of the marshy Everglades, but the missiles are long gone. Now, to mark the 50th anniversary of the missile crisis, students at a Miami aviation school are restoring one of the original Nike Hercules missiles once tipped with a nuclear warhead and aimed at Cuba. The United States and Cuba remain ideological foes to this day, and Florida is home to tens of thousands of Cubans who fled the island after Fidel Castro’s 1959 revolution, but tensions have cooled down considerably as memories fade. The students realize the decommissioned missile was once part of a historic event, but confess to knowing little about one of the momentous episodes of the Cold War. “I just know it was part of the Cuban missile crisis, but I haven’t researched it,” said Abraham Hidalgo, 17, one of the students at George T. Baker Aviation School. The 41-foot (12.5-metre), surface-to-air Nike Hercules missile was previously stored in a U.S. Army depot in Alabama, covered in dust and spider webs. A flatbed truck hauled it down Interstate-95 to the school next to Miami International Airport. For the last two months, students have been working to restore the 5-ton missile to near-original condition; sanding wings, replacing sheet metal and repainting the U.S. Army markings. Its final destination is Everglades National Park, where it will be installed at an abandoned Nike missile base. The 13-day missile crisis began on Oct. 16, 1962, when then-President John F. Kennedy first learned the Soviet Union was installing missiles in Cuba, barely 90 miles (145 km) off the Florida coast. After secret negotiations between Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, the United States agreed not to invade Cuba if the Soviet Union withdrew its missiles from the island. “The irony is a lot of these kids are Cuban,” said George T. Baker principal Sean Gallagan. “And if this missile was used as it was intended, a lot of these kids wouldn’t be here.” Samuel Robles, 16, said he did not know a lot about the incident but “heard something about Che Guevara on the History Channel,” referring to the Argentine-born revolutionary who fought in the 1959 revolution. In 1962, there were four Nike missile bases in south Florida, each armed with 18 Hercules missiles ready to intercept a Soviet attack from Cuba, recalled Charles Carter, 66, an Army veteran who served at the bases for three years in the 1960s. “We were the first line of defense the Russians would have had to take out before they could attack the rest of the country,” said Carter, who has spent 10 years working on the restoration project with the help of Everglades park officials.

111,NKE,"Lance Armstrong steps down from charity, Nike drops him","AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Lance Armstrong stepped down as chairman of the Livestrong cancer support charity he founded, as Nike Inc dropped the disgraced cyclist over the doping scandal that will likely cost him his seven Tour de France titles. Armstrong’s Livestrong foundation is best known for the more than 70 million iconic yellow rubbery wrist bands that have been distributed worldwide, but the scandal threatened to overshadow the group’s wider work with cancer patients. So far, donations have actually increased despite the scandal. “To spare the foundation any negative effects as a result of controversy surrounding my cycling career, I will conclude my chairmanship,” Armstrong said in a statement on Wednesday. He will continue to serve on the board. At around the same time that the foundation announced Armstrong’s resignation, Nike posted a statement to its website saying the athletic apparel maker would still back the charity but could no longer sponsor the man behind it. “Due to the seemingly insurmountable evidence that Lance Armstrong participated in doping and misled Nike for more than a decade, it is with great sadness that we have terminated our contract with him,” the company said. Beer maker Anheuser-Busch said it too would end its relationship with Armstrong when his contract expires at the end of this year, though it would also continue to back the foundation and its athletic events. Oakley Inc, the sunglasses brand also associated with Armstrong, said in a statement it was reviewing the reports into the cyclist’s conduct and awaiting a final decision from the sport’s international authorities. A Radio Shack spokesman said the electronics retailer remains a sponsor of Armstrong and Livestrong. ESPN reported two other sponsors, Trek Bicycles and the energy drink maker FRS, were also ending their relationships with the cyclist. Representatives of the two companies were not immediately available to comment. Armstrong, now retired, is set to lose his record seven Tour de France titles after the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency published a 1,000-page report last week that said the American took part in and organized an elaborate, sophisticated doping scheme on his way to his unrivalled success. Cycling’s world governing body, the International Cycling Union, has yet to rule on the USADA report. They can either confirm Armstrong’s life ban and strip him of his seven Tour titles or take the matter to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The report accused Armstrong, as head of the US Postal Service Pro Cycling Team, of running “the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen.” It included sworn testimony of 26 people, including 15 riders, who described years of performance drug use. Armstrong, 41, has always denied he took banned substances during his glittering career but decided not to challenge the USADA charges against him. That defiance was such a part of Armstrong’s personal brand that Nike made a commercial in the early 2000s featuring him being tested for drugs. “Everybody wants to know what I’m on. What am I on? I’m on my bike, busting my ass six hours a day. What are you on?” Armstrong said in a voiceover to the ad. Before Armstrong, the most high profile athlete dropped by Nike was probably the football player Michael Vick, cut loose in 2007 amid charges he bankrolled a dog-fighting ring. One analyst who follows the company dismissed the idea that separating from Armstrong would have any impact on Nike or its sales of Livestrong products. “I am not sure the average Joe really cares. Nike and all sporting goods companies have a history of standing by their sponsored athletes,” said Paul Swinand, a retail analyst at Morningstar. “Let’s put it this way. There’s a guy on my street that has survived cancer three times. Brain cancer. Is he going to take out the Livestrong band? No.” Armstrong founded the Lance Armstrong Foundation in 1997, not long after being diagnosed with testicular cancer, according to the foundation’s website. The organization launched the Livestrong brand in 2003 as it widened its cancer patient-support services. The foundation is now known by both names. His departure as chairman comes just two days before the foundation’s fund-raising gala in Austin, Texas, where Armstrong lives. Celebrities such as Sean Penn and Ben Stiller are expected to attend, with comedian Robin Williams and singer Norah Jones to provide entertainment. “It is his effort to inoculate the foundation against any risk or damage associated with current controversy in the cycling world,” Livestrong spokeswoman Katherine McLane said in an interview. So far, the foundation’s financial health appears not to have suffered from Armstrong’s cycling scandal. Contributions have actually risen this year as the probe gathered momentum. For the year 2012 to date, the foundation has reported revenue of $33.8 million, up 2.1 percent from this point a year ago, according to documents provided to Reuters. Austin resident Jennifer Harris said that Wednesday’s news in no way changes her plans to raise money for Sunday’s Team Livestrong Challenge, in memory of a friend who passed away a year ago after a 13-year battle with cancer. “I feel like Livestrong is something that is frankly bigger than Lance Armstrong,” Harris said. Since late August, when Armstrong said he would not contest the USADA findings and the agency said it planned to strip him of his titles, Livestrong has received more than 16,000 contributions, averaging about $97 each. “This is almost twice normal levels,” said Rae Bazzarre, another Livestrong spokeswoman. One of Armstrong’s most prominent backers, Texas governor and one-time presidential candidate Rick Perry, insisted people should not connect the allegations or Armstrong’s resignation to the cancer research he has backed. “People of the state of Texas, and people around the world, have to decide whether or not Lance Armstrong is still a hero to them,” he said at a press conference Wednesday.

123,NKE,Nike close to selling Cole Haan to Apax - sources,"NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Nike Inc is in final negotiations to sell its Cole Haan handbag and shoe brand to private equity firm Apax Partners, in a deal that could fetch around $500 million, according to three people familiar with the matter. Apax has prevailed over other private equity firms including TPG Capital Management and Berkshire Partners in the auction for Cole Haan, which sells footwear, clothing and leather handbags, the people said on Monday. London-based Apax has teamed up with former Converse Chief Executive Jack Boys to help run Cole Haan after a takeover, two of the people said. The sale would come roughly 24 years after Nike acquired Cole Haan for $80 million, as the world’s biggest athletic shoe and clothing maker seeks to focus on its namesake brand, as well as Jordan, Converse and Hurley. Founded by Trafton Cole and Eddie Haan in 1928, the fashion label operates flagship stores in major U.S. cities and also sells its products at department stores and other retailers. Nike said in May it was looking to sell Cole Haan and soccer gear unit Umbro and announced a $225 million deal last month to sell Umbro to Iconix Brand Group Inc.  Nike hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc to assist with the auction, sources previously told Reuters. The people asked not to be identified because details of the auction are not public. Representatives for Nike and Berkshire Partners did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Apax and TPG declined to comment. Cole Haan is among several footwear companies that have gone on the auction block over the past year. In May, footwear retailer Collective Brands Inc was purchased by a consortium including Wolverine Worldwide Inc , Blum Capital Partners and Golden Gate Capital for about $1.32 billion. Family-owned footwear brand Doc Martens also explored a sale of the company, although the discussions ended earlier this summer.",11052012,http://www.reuters.com/article/colehaan-apax/nike-close-to-selling-cole-haan-to-apax-sources-idUSL1E8M59PB20121105
124,NKE,"Nike tells U.S. Supreme Court: Enough, Already","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nike Inc (NKE.N) urged the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday to make a lawsuit by a smaller rival go away with one big swoosh. Several justices appeared sympathetic to the sporting goods maker’s argument to stop Already LLC from challenging its trademark covering a top-selling pair of sneakers, after Nike had agreed to drop its own lawsuit accusing that company of making illegal copies. The case may be especially significant to companies such as Nike rival Adidas SE (ADSGn.DE) and luxury goods makers Coach Inc COH.N and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (LVMH.PA), which generate substantial revenue and customer goodwill from products with recognizable trademarks and often sue to fend off imitators. A loss for Nike could make companies more hesitant to file trademark lawsuits, given the lessened incentive for alleged infringers to drop or settle counterclaims. In 2008, Nike registered a trademark on the stitching, eyelet panels and other design features of Air Force 1, a low-cut sneaker that the Beaverton, Oregon-based company launched in 1982 and which sells in the millions each year. In July 2009, Nike sued Already, which makes sneakers under the Yums brand, saying its “Sugar” and “Soulja Boy” shoes had features covered by the Air Force 1 trademark. Already had been on Nike’s internal “top 10” list of alleged infringers. After Already countersued to void the trademark, Nike decided to drop its lawsuit, believing Yums sneakers posed no real commercial threat. It also promised, through a legal promise known as a covenant, not to sue Already. But the Arlington, Texas-based company refused to abandon its counterclaim and accused Nike of dropping the original lawsuit to deprive courts of jurisdiction over the whole matter. Last November, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said Nike’s action did just that, and the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether that ruling was correct. At Wednesday’s oral argument, James Dabney, a lawyer for Already, contended that Nike was asserting an improper, “far-reaching claim of right to exclude competition.” But some justices were troubled by Already’s refusal to say that it would produce no sneakers that would bother Nike, and Dabney’s inability to explain what kind of protection would satisfy the smaller company. “Is there any covenant that exists in the world that would make you secure?” Justice Elena Kagan asked. “I suppose I’m having a little bit of difficulty with an answer that says ‘no.’” Chief Justice John Roberts suggested Already had extracted more from Nike than most in winning a covenant not to be sued. “Nike can’t go around giving these covenants left and right, because if they do, they will undermine their own trademark,” he said. Thomas Goldstein, a lawyer for Nike, called Already “the only company in the entire world that has a promise that’s substantial not to be sued under this trademark,” and that this “really resolved the case.” He did acknowledge that Nike’s promise would not cover exact copies or “colorable imitations” of its sneakers. “Our point is not that it covers every future shoe of theirs,” he said. Goldstein urged the court to reject the federal government’s recommendation that the 2nd Circuit ruling be thrown out and that the case be remanded, or returned, to a lower court to gain more clarity about Nike’s covenant and Already’s product plans. Kagan appeared to agree that keeping the case going might not resolve much. “It sounds as though we’re remanding for no purpose, given what Already has said throughout the course of the litigation and, indeed, in this court today,” she told Ginger Anders, a Justice Department lawyer. Two companies with well-known trademarks, clothing maker Levi Strauss & Co and automaker Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), filed briefs supporting Nike. A decision is expected by the end of June.

126,NKE,Adidas to restart Primeknit sales after court ruling,"FRANKFURT, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Sports apparel maker Adidas  said a German court has thrown out an injunction brought by rival Nike over its new Primeknit sneaker leaving it free to resume production and sales of the shoe. Nike was awarded a temporary injunction just over two months ago, after claiming that the shoe infringed the patent of its Flyknit sneaker that was launched in February. But Adidas said it had never been given a chance to present its own case, and the court last month agreed, saying it was likely it would set the injunction aside. “Adidas vigorously denies it has infringed the patent, and has filed for cancellation of the ( Nike) p atent, with documents showing that the technology has been known since the 1940s,” the Germany-based company said in a statement on Wednesday. The uppers of the green Flyknit shoe and the red and white Primeknit shoe are both made from one piece of fused yarn, with both shoes looking as though they have been knitted. Sneaker uppers are usually made of several pieces stitched and glued together. Adidas launched its shoe at the London Olympics in July with a limited run of 2,012 pairs costing 220 pounds ($350) apiece. It has said it wants to use the technology for other categories of sneaker. Nike said the decision was just one step in the legal process. “We will continue to aggressively protect our intellectual property rights,” a spokesman in Germany said, adding that it had the option to appeal the decision.",11072012,http://www.reuters.com/article/adidas-nike-primeknit/adidas-to-restart-primeknit-sales-after-court-ruling-idUSL5E8M78M720121107

131,NKE,UPDATE 3-Nike buoyed by strong domestic demand; shares jump,"* Second-quarter EPS $1.14 vs estimate $1.00 * Futures orders up 6 percent * Futures orders in North America up 14 percent By Nivedita Bhattacharjee Dec 20 (Reuters) - Nike Inc reported forecast-topping quarterly profit on Thursday on strong North American demand, and its orders volume indicated steady worldwide demand. Its shares were up 6 percent after the bell. Orders for Nike-branded shoes and clothing scheduled for delivery from December 2012 through April 2013, known as futures orders, were up 14 percent in North America, Nike’s most mature market. “In North America, we created great momentum. This is somewhat counterintuitive to some, given this market size and assumed maturity. But I see tremendous growth potential in North America,” Chief Executive Mark Parker said on a call with analysts. Worldwide orders for the Beaverton, Oregon-based company were up 6 percent, the same as last quarter. “The biggest driver of this stock is usually futures orders. Last quarter, futures orders were lower than expected. This quarter they came in line, and North America was stronger than expected,” said Brian Yarbrough, consumer discretionary analyst for Edward Jones. Yarbrough also said the company’s gross margins for the quarter, though still down, exceeded expectations. “If you go back a few quarters, gross margins have been down a lot more. The less of a decline is positive,” he said. Nike’s gross margins fell 30 basis points at the end of its fiscal second quarter. The company said it continues to expect gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘13 with those coming in more or less flat in the full year. For the second quarter ended Nov. 30, the company earned $384 million, or $1.14 a share, from continuing operations. Analysts, on average, were expecting the company to earn $1 a share, as per Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 7 percent to $6.0 billion. Nike had been caught with excess inventory in key markets like China and was finding it difficult to tackle intense competition and frequent promotional sales by local brands, while distributors and retailers remain wary in an uncertain economy. “The China problem won’t go away in 12-18 months, but it is no worse than it was expected,” said Rahul Sharma, founder and managing director of Neev Capital, a London-based consulting company. “But look at North America, it is on fire. And this is such a big business.” On a call with analysts, finance head Don Blair said the company “proactively canceled orders and reduced futures to tightly manage the amount of new product flowing into the (Chinese) market,” so as to be able to handle the extra inventory already present there. The company taking such a hit to near-term futures orders for a long-term benefit was a sign of strength for Sharma. On Thursday, Nike said inventories for the second quarter rose 9 percent, a much smaller rise than the 35 percent it saw last year. Nike shares were trading up at $104.75 after the bell. They closed at $99 on the New York Stock Exchange.",12202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/nike-results/update-3-nike-buoyed-by-strong-domestic-demand-shares-jump-idUSL1E8NKCV020121220

136,NKE,UPDATE 1-Golf-Oakley challenges Nike over McIlroy move,"By Keith Weir LONDON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - American sunglasses maker Oakley has launched legal action to try to retain its sponsorship of world number one golfer Rory McIlroy who is set to become the new face of sportswear giant Nike. U.S. PGA champion McIlroy is poised to rubber-stamp a 10-year deal with U.S. company Nike worth as much as $250 million, according to media reports. Nike is set to supply the 23-year-old Northern Irishman’s clubs and have its name or logo on his clothing in an exclusive deal. However, Oakley, owned by Italy’s Luxottica, is challenging the move and started legal action in its home state of California last month. “Oakley’s contract with Rory has a right of first refusal that permits us to retain Rory as an Oakley endorser by matching any offer he receives covering our products,” the company said in a statement to Reuters. “These types of provisions are common in the industry. Oakley values Rory and will do all it can to retain him,” it added. The Dubai-based hotel company Jumeirah Group confirmed earlier on Tuesday that its five-year sponsorship with 2011 U.S. Open champion McIlroy had ended, the latest indication that confirmation of the Nike deal was imminent. “Jumeirah became my first corporate sponsor when I turned professional back in 2007 and I would like to thank everyone at the company for their support in helping me become the player I am today,” McIlroy said in a news release. The player, who topped the money-lists on both sides of the Atlantic last year, said in November he did not think that ditching the Titleist clubs that have taken him to the top of the sport would affect his game. Nike is hoping a partnership with the clean-cut McIlroy will help it to move on after it dropped disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong last year over his doping scandal. The company stuck with former world number one golfer Tiger Woods despite the bad publicity the American suffered when a series of extra-marital affairs were exposed in 2009.",1082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/golf-mcilroy-sponsors/update-1-golf-oakley-challenges-nike-over-mcilroy-move-idUSL4N0AD8L320130108

138,NKE,Nike wins trademark case in Supreme Court,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nike Inc (NKE.N) won a victory at the U.S. Supreme Court barring a smaller rival from suing to void the company’s trademark for its top-selling Air Force 1 sneakers. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for a unanimous court on Wednesday that Nike’s promise not to pursue an infringement lawsuit against Already LLC, maker of Yums sneakers, meant that the Texas company could not pursue its own trademark challenge. “Already’s arguments boil down to a basic policy objection that dismissing this case allows Nike to bully small innovators lawfully operating in the public domain,” Roberts wrote. But the argument did not justify letting its lawsuit proceed, he wrote. Wednesday’s decision upheld a November 2011 ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. James Dabney, a lawyer for Already, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nor did Nike. Wednesday’s decision may help companies such as Nike rival Adidas SE (ADSGn.DE) and luxury goods makers Coach Inc COH.N and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (LVMH.PA), which often sue to prevent alleged imitators from interfering with their revenue streams and customer goodwill. The case began in 2009, when Nike claimed in a lawsuit that Already’s Sugar and Soulja Boy shoes infringed Nike’s trademark on the stitching, eyelet panels and other features of Air Force 1. Nike, based in Beaverton, Oregon, launched the low-cut Air Force 1 sneaker in 1982 and sells millions of them each year. After Already countersued to void the trademark, Nike dropped its lawsuit, believing Yums was not a commercial threat, and gave a promise in the form of a covenant not to sue Already. But Already, based in Arlington, Texas, refused to drop its own case and accused Nike of dropping the original lawsuit to deprive courts of jurisdiction. Roberts, however, said that allowing Already’s lawsuit to continue would encourage large and small companies to use litigation as a “weapon” rather than as a last resort to settle disputes, which could discourage innovation. “Accepting Already’s theory may benefit the small competitor in this case,” he said. “But lowering the gates for one party lowers the gates for all. As a result, larger companies with more resources will have standing to challenge the intellectual property portfolios of their more humble rivals - not because they are threatened by any particular patent or trademark, but simply because they are competitors in the same market.” Roberts also agreed with Nike that Already was unlikely to produce any shoe that would not be protected. “If such a shoe exists, the parties have not pointed to it, there is no evidence that Already has dreamt of it, and we cannot conceive of it,” Roberts wrote. “It sits, as far as we can tell, on a shelf between Dorothy’s ruby slippers and Perseus’ winged sandals.” Justice Anthony Kennedy concurred in the decision, saying that other companies should not assume they can automatically end rivals’ trademark cases with covenants similar to Nike’s. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor joined Kennedy’s concurrence. Two companies with well-known trademarks, clothing maker Levi Strauss & Co and automaker Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), filed briefs supporting Nike. The case is Already LLC v.

Although commercial terms were not disclosed, media reports say the agreement with the Northern Irishman unveiled on Monday is worth as much as $250 million over 10 years, one of the most lucrative in global sports as Nike moves on after dropping disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong last year. McIlroy, 23, was previously sponsored by golf brand Titleist and other golfers have struggled to replicate their earlier success after switching to a new equipment provider. However, McIlroy was full of confidence ahead of the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship which starts on Thursday. “The new driver that I will play with this week is awesome,” he told a news conference to announce his sponsorship. “As soon as I hit it I knew it was going in the bag straight away. I’m hitting it further - I thought I was hitting it far before, but this is really taking it to a new level.” The U.S. PGA champion visited Nike’s research and development facility in Fort Worth, Texas, in late 2012 to try out his new clubs and balls and has continued to practice over Christmas and New Year. He said the sponsorship deal was about improving his game rather than personal riches. “I play for titles, I don’t play for money...If at the end of 2013 I haven’t won a major I will be disappointed,” said McIlroy, adding the new nike balls were more more stable in the wind and he was now driving the ball at about 180 miles (290 kms) an hour. The twice major winner topped the tournament earnings lists in both the United States and Europe last year. Nike is also a long-time sponsor of world number two Tiger Woods, standing by the U.S. golfer in 2009 despite the bad publicity he suffered when a series of extra-marital affairs came to light. A new Nike TV commercial featuring the two golfers was shown for the first time at a news conference in Abu Dhabi where Nike officially confirmed it had recruited McIlroy - one of the worst kept secrets in sport. “There is still some equity (value) in the Woods’ brand. McIlroy, rather than being a replacement, is the heir apparent,” said Simon Chadwick, professor of sport business strategy at England’s Coventry University. “In golf and cycling they built much of their business on the back of two individuals. They needed to move quickly and decisively to make a big signing and with McIlroy that is what they have done.” Golf provides 3-4 percent of Nike’s total revenue, Cindy Davis, Nike Golf president, told Reuters. Under the deal, McIlroy will use the company’s clubs and balls and wear its clothing with the familiar swoosh logo. McIlroy is part of a high-profile sporting couple with former world women’s tennis number one Caroline Wozniacki. The agreement with Nike has not been accepted by all of McIlroy’s previous sponsors. Sunglasses maker Oakley has begun legal action to try to retain its sponsorship deal with McIlroy, saying it had the right to match any improved agreement with another company.

Commercial terms were not disclosed but media reports say the agreement with the fresh-faced Northern Irish golfer unveiled on Monday is worth as much as $250 million over 10 years, one of the most lucrative in global sports. McIlroy was previously sponsored by golf brand Titleist. The U.S. PGA champion, 23, topped the tournament earnings lists in both the United States and Europe last year and is seen as having supplanted Tiger Woods as the game’s greatest talent. The agreement is especially important for Nike, the world’s largest sportswear company, as it seeks to move on from the doping scandal that forced it to ditch American Armstrong. Nike is also a long-time sponsor of Woods, standing by the U.S. golfer in 2009 despite the bad publicity he suffered when a series of extra-marital affairs came to light.

145,NKE,Nike has no plans to use Pistorius in future ads,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nike Inc said on Monday it has no plan to run future ads using Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius, charged with murdering his girlfriend, after the South African became the sporting goods maker’s latest sponsored athlete to face trouble. “Nike has no plans for Oscar Pistorius in upcoming campaigns,” KeJuan Wilkins, a Nike spokesman, said in an email. Nike is once again dealing with a publicity problem stemming from a sponsored celebrity. Others include NFL quarterback Michael Vick, who pleaded guilty in 2007 to dog-fighting charges; Olympic runner Marion Jones, who was convicted of lying to a grand jury about her use of performance-enhancing drugs; and Tiger Woods, who faced a torrent of bad press and issued a public apology for well-publicized extramarital affairs. Last year, Nike dropped cyclist Lance Armstrong after he was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned for life for doping. Pistorius, known worldwide as the “Blade Runner” for his prosthetic legs, was formally accused last week in South Africa of the premeditated shooting of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, a charge that could put him behind bars for life if he is convicted. Pistorius, a double amputee, became one of the most recognized figures in world athletics last year when he reached the semi-final of the men’s 400-metres at the London 2012 Olympics. He was born without a fibula in either lower leg, and underwent a double amputation as an 11-month-old baby. Running on a pair of high-technology carbon fiber prosthetic “blades”, he smashed Paralympic world records and went on to compete against able-bodied athletes at the highest levels.

147,NKE,UPDATE 2-Nike halts Pistorius deal to protect brand,"* Nike suspends endorsement deal with Pistorius * Sportswear company’s athletes hit by series of scandals * “Blade Runner” backed by several major sponsors By Keith Weir LONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Nike froze its contract with “Blade Runner” Oscar Pistorius on Thursday after he was charged with murdering his girlfriend, the latest in a series of scandals to hit athletes sponsored by the sportswear giant. Criticised in the past for being slow to respond when its sporting heroes got into trouble, Nike distanced itself from Pistorius, the Paralympics champion accused of shooting dead model Reeva Steenkamp on Feb. 14, Valentine’s Day. “Nike has suspended its contract with Oscar Pistorius,” the world’s largest sportswear company said in a brief statement released in London. “We believe Oscar Pistorius should be afforded due process and we will continue to monitor the situation closely.” The decision means the South African will receive no further payments from Nike for the time being and not appear in any of its promotions. Pistorius, the world’s best known Paralympic athlete,    denies murder. He says he killed his girlfriend by accident after firing into a locked toilet door when he feared an intruder had broken into his home. Nike, famous for its “swoosh” logo, has had to try to limit the damage to its brand from a number of scandals involving highly paid sports stars in recent years. It ended a long-standing sponsorship of U.S. cyclist Lance Armstrong last October after the Texan was caught up in a doping scandal that led to him being stripped of his seven Tour de France titles. Nike stuck with American golfer Tiger Woods in 2009 when a series of extra-marital affairs were exposed. Contrasting the treatment of Armstrong and Woods, marketing experts drew a distinction between evidence of cheating in  sport and a greyer area of trying to make moral judgements on  an athlete’s private life. Pistorius, a double amputee, ran against able-bodied athletes in the London Olympics last year, further raising his profile after a battle to be allowed to compete. His story of sporting triumph over physical disability made him especially attractive to advertisers and he had endorsement contracts worth an estimated $2 million a year. Nike has sponsored Pistorius since 2007, supplying him with running kit and special soles that he wears on the base of his carbon fibre racing blades. His other sponsorship deals with companies include British telecoms firm, U.S. sunglasses maker Oakley and French designer Thierry Mugler. His sponsors have largely declined to comment on their contracts while his bail hearing is taking place in Pretoria. Nike is still prepared to pay big money to tie up the next generation of sporting stars. It added world number one golfer Rory McIlroy to its roster last month in a deal reported to be worth up to $250 million over the next decade.

They will wear an unbranded kit next season after dropping current supplier Kappa in a legal dispute over alleged quality and distribution issues. “AS Roma is committed to becoming the premier football club in the world, on and off the field,” Roma CEO Italo Zanzi said in a statement. “This partnership is a fundamental step in that mission,” he added. Roma have a long way to go to meet that ambitious target. They are currently seventh in Italy’s 20-team Serie A and last won the league in 2001. The club have plans to move to a new stadium and last month gave a prospective Middle Eastern investor a deadline of Thursday, March 14, to show he has the funds needed to take a stake in the club.

155,NKE,"Nike profit tops Wall Street estimates, shares rise","(Reuters) - Nike Inc’s (NKE.N) quarterly profit beat Wall Street’s expectations, as margins increased and world-wide future demand for its apparel and shoes rose, sending its shares up 8 percent. Global orders for Nike-branded shoes and clothing scheduled for delivery from March through July 2013, known as futures orders, rose 6 percent compared to orders reported for the same period last year. In North America, the company’s biggest market, orders increased 11 percent. The company also saw a turnaround in future demand in Greater China, with orders rising 4 percent, after falling in the previous two quarters. “They turned China much faster than we thought,” said Brian Yarbrough, consumer discretionary analyst for Edward Jones. Yarbrough said this turnaround was important as China is among Nike’s highest margin markets. Lower shipping costs and high price tags help the company make more money on their products in that region, he said. “In China, we are seeing progress against our strategy to reset the marketplace but we still have more to do before we can capture its long-term growth potential,” Nike Chief Executive Mark Parker said on a conference call with analysts. Nike had been stuck with excess inventory in China and was finding it difficult to tackle intense competition and frequent promotional sales by local brands. Distributors and retailers were also wary of an uncertain global economy. Shares of the Beaverton, Oregon-based company rose to $57.93 Thursday in extended trade. They closed at $53.60 on the New York Stock Exchange. Paul Swinand, an analyst with Morningstar, said one of the biggest challenges for Nike is to grow in its more mature markets. He said strong demand in North America shows it is able to do that. Nike also posted its first growth in gross margins in around two years, with margins rising 30 basis points in the quarter. High costs of raw material and labor pressured the company’s margins over the past couple of years and Nike had been fighting it by raising prices on merchandise. “Gross margin benefited from the combination of pricing actions and easing material costs, which more than offset higher labor costs,” the company said. For the third quarter ended February 28, the company earned $662 million, or 73 cents a share, compared with $569 million, or 61 cents a share last year.

162,NKE,"US STOCKS-Wall St rises as Cyprus fears ease, Nike jumps","* Cyprus to spin off Greek units of its battered banks * S&P; 500 on track for second negative week of the year * Nike shares hit record, Micron at near two-year high * Dow up 0.5 pct, S&P; 500 up 0.5 pct, Nasdaq up 0.5 pct By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks bounced back on Friday as a banking deal between Greece and Cyprus eased concerns about a Cypriot financial meltdown. A 12 percent jump in Nike shares a day after it posted results boosted the consumer discretionary sector of the S&P; 500, which led the benchmark’s gains. Cyprus agreed with Greece on a takeover of the Greek units of Cypriot banks, which ended uncertainty about the fate of those operations. But Russia rebuffed Cypriot appeals for aid, leaving the island’s leaders scrambling to strike a bailout deal with the European Union by next week or face the collapse of its financial system and an exit from the euro that could roil the euro zone. The FTSEurofirst-300 index of pan-European stocks dipped 0.1 percent, while Wall Street advanced in Friday’s session. But the three major U.S. stock indexes were down for the week, with Cyprus weighing on markets since Monday. The lingering concern among investors is that if Cyprus leaves the euro zone, then maybe other larger countries will follow and debilitate the bloc. The worry “is the psychological knock-on effect of the credible possibility of some (country) saying ‘Cyprus got out, now they are on their own, they devalued their currency, they don’t have to go through austerity’,” said Art Hogan, managing director at Lazard Capital Markets in New York. “What is going to stop Greece from doing the same thing? And you start a daisy chain.” The Dow Jones industrial average rose 73.53 points, or 0.51 percent, to 14,495.02. The S&P; 500 gained 8.18 points, or 0.53 percent, to 1,553.98. The Nasdaq Composite  added 14.50 points or 0.45 percent, to 3,237.10. The S&P; 500 is still on track to post only its second weekly decline so far this year. Although the index was down a modest 0.43 percent at midday, this is also the largest weekly percentage decline since the last week of 2012. Nike’s shares hit an all-time high a day after its quarterly profit beat Wall Street’s expectations as margins increased and global future demand for its apparel and shoes rose. Nike topped at $60.23. At midday, the stock rose 11.8 percent to $59.94. Tiffany & Co reported a slightly higher profit for the quarter that included the holiday season, and said the pace of its worldwide sales growth would pick up this year. Its shares gained 1.7 percent to $69.04. Micron Technology posted a quarterly net loss on Thursday, but the chipmaker said the outlook for memory chip prices is improving. The stock gained 11.8 percent to $10.14, its highest in almost two years.",3222013,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-usa-stocks/us-stocks-wall-st-rises-as-cyprus-fears-ease-nike-jumps-idUSL1N0CE6ST20130322
163,NKE,EBay pulls Nike 'Boston Massacre' t-shirt listing,"SAN FRANCISCO, April 25 (Reuters) - EBay Inc pulled a listing on Wednesday for a Nike Inc t-shirt displaying the phrase “Boston Massacre,” citing the online marketplace’s policy against “offensive materials.” The t-shirt was listed for sale earlier this week on eBay and received bids of more than $150,000, according to bid history on the company’s website. The t-shirt refers to the rivalry between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox baseball teams and has images of red blood spattered on the word Boston. In the wake of the Boston Marathon attack, Nike pulled all the shirts from stores, but a used one turned up on eBay. An eBay spokeswoman said the shirt was removed because it violated a company policy that bans listings of items that promote or glorify hatred, violence, racial, sexual, or religious intolerance, or promote organizations with such views. EBay will also remove listings that graphically portray graphic violence or victims of violence, unless they have substantial social, artistic, or political value, according to the policy. A check on Wednesday afternoon by Reuters confirmed that the listing was taken down.",4252013,http://www.reuters.com/article/ebay-bostonmassacre/ebay-pulls-nike-boston-massacre-t-shirt-listing-idUSL2N0DC2AI20130425

Police with riot gear were deployed to move about 3,000 mostly female workers who had blocked a road outside their factory owned by Sabrina (Cambodia) Garment Manufacturing in Kampong Speu province, west of the capital, Phnom Penh. A Nike spokeswoman in the United States told Reuters by e-mail that the company was “concerned” about the allegations and was investigating. Nike requires contract manufacturers to respect employees’ rights to freedom of association, the spokeswoman added. Sun Vanny, president of the Free Trade Union (FTU) at Sabrina, told Reuters the injured included a woman who was two months pregnant and who had lost her child after military police pushed her to the ground. “There was a pregnant woman among them. She lost blood and then she lost the baby,” he said. According to the International Monetary Fund, garments accounted for 75 pct of Cambodia’s total exports of $5.22 billion in 2011. Low-cost labour has attracted manufacturers making clothes and shoes for Western brands but strikes over pay and working conditions have become common. This month, two workers were killed at a factory making running shoes for Asics when part of a warehouse fell in on them. Police revised down the original death toll of three given by a minister. A series of deadly incidents at factories in Bangladesh, including the collapse of a building last month that killed more than 1,000 people, has focused global attention on safety in factories in Asia makes goods for Western companies. Sun Vanny said the workers making the Nike clothing had been staging strikes and protests since May 21. They want the company, which employs more than 5,000 people at the plant, to give them $14 a month to help pay for transport, rent and healthcare costs on top of their $74 minimum wage. “Police used an electric baton to hit me on the head and if other workers hadn’t pulled me away, I would be dead,” Leng Pros, a 28-year-old male worker, told Reuters from his hospital bed. “I didn’t know what happened next, I fell to the ground.” Police and military police officials declined to comment on the clash, saying they were still collecting reports.

The group had flourished during Armstrong’s cycling career, which saw him win the grueling Tour de France race seven times, titles he was stripped of last year amid accusations that he used performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong admitted to doping early this year and stepped aside from the charity, which he had founded after being diagnosed with testicular cancer. The group said Nike’s move was not unexpected. “We expected and planned for changes like this and are therefore in a good position to adjust swiftly and move forward with our patient-focused work,” the group said in a statement.

169,NKE,"Not just Bangladesh, garment makers pressured in Cambodia as well","PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - As investment in Cambodia’s textile industry surges, so is labour unrest, putting pressure on suppliers to the world’s big garment brands to raise wages and improve sometimes grim conditions in one of the last bastions of low-cost factories. Hundreds of angry workers rampaged this week through a textile plant in Cambodia that supplies U.S. sportswear company Nike Inc, clashing with police over their demands for a pay hike. The violence came just weeks after over 1,100 workers were killed in the collapse of a building housing garment factories in Bangladesh, another impoverished Asian nation where mass-produced textiles are the biggest export earner. Cambodia is considered one of the better locations in the world for low-cost garment manufacturing with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) monitoring pay and working conditions at many factories. But strikes and sometimes violent protests have been on the rise as unions emboldened by a shortage of skilled workers press complaints that companies have failed to raise wages enough or improve safety. Strikes by the country’s more than 300,000 garment workers nearly quadrupled last year to 134, according to the Garment Manufacturers Association of Cambodia, the main industry body. The 48 strikes so far this year are already more than in the whole of 2010 or 2011. “Supply of skilled workers is a problem,” said Kaing Monika, a business development manager at the Garment Manufacturers Association of Cambodia (GMAC), the main industry body. “Most existing factories are running at full capacity.” Nike was the latest big brand to face protest action at its Cambodia-based suppliers in recent months, joining H&M; Hennes and Mauritz AB, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Gap Inc, and Puma SE among others. The international brands buy garments from local manufacturers and do not have direct control over pay or working conditions. But the major companies have signed to the ILO scheme aimed at ensuring suppliers meet legal requirements on wages and work conditions. The garments industry has become by far the country’s biggest export earner, with shipments up 10 percent in 2012 to $4.44 billion. Until this year, the minimum wage in the textile sector was $61 a month, compared to $38 in Bangladesh and more than $150 in China. The government raised it in March to $80, including a health care subsidy, but strikers at the Nike factory and other workers complain that wage rises have not kept up with costs. “Life is hard, we have a lot of expenses with a low wage. Sometimes, we just borrow money from other workers,” said 28-year-old Mao Pov, one of those on strike at the Sabrina Garment Manufacturing plant that supplies Nike as well as privately held Wilson Sporting Goods Co. Inflation in Cambodia was 3 percent in 2012, which is low for developing nations in Asia, although many workers complain the price of basic items has risen faster. Sweden’s H&M;, the world’s second-largest fashion retailer, said a general election scheduled to be held in July had caused some instability among workers at plants run by its Cambodian suppliers. “This being an election year, the situation in the country was generally more disorderly than usual during early spring,” said spokeswoman Andrea Roos. After minimum wages were increased, “the situation on the labour market in Cambodia has been more stable”, she said. Workers at the Nike-linked plant first went on strike on May 21 even though the factory had raised their minimum wage. The union on strike says that the health and other benefits that were previously paid separately were folded into the new wage, and is demanding another $14 hike. A spokeswoman for Nike told Reuters last week that compensation at the Cambodian plant was the responsibility of the factory, but that Nike was in “close contact” with the factory and would “continue to monitor the situation”. The Southeast Asian nation’s textile industry has often been touted as a model for fair production because of the ILO’s Better Factories Cambodia (BFC) program that has monitored factories there for more than a decade. But union leaders and activists say the program has masked a deterioration in workers’ rights as factory owners have taken advantage of the BFC’s lack of enforcement powers and responded to pressure from buyers for ever lower prices. Factories regularly violate union rights and exceed legal limits on overtime work, a report by Stanford Law School’s International Human Rights Clinic released in February found. The BFC found evidence of sharply worsening fire safety standards at factories in its most recent report this year. In May, two workers were killed at a factory making running shoes for Asics Corp when part of a warehouse fell in on them at a company that was not part of the ILO program. Thousands of workers have been taken sick in mass fainting incidents in recent years — including at the Sabrina factory — a phenomenon that has been blamed on a combination of poor nutrition, long working hours and poor ventilation. “The brands cannot hide behind the ILO,” said David Welsh, country director at Solidarity Center in Phnom Penh, which advocates for worker rights. “If the brands are not pressuring factories to improve, they are not going to improve because everybody is out to make as much money in the industry as they possibly can.” ",6062013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cambodia-protests/not-just-bangladesh-garment-makers-pressured-in-cambodia-as-well-idUSBRE95504820130606

171,NKE,UPDATE 2-Adidas sets new soccer sales goal in World Cup year,"* Adidas targets record soccer sales in World Cup year * Soccer market dominated by Adidas and Nike * Adidas CEO plays down concerns over Brazil protests   (Adds comment on Brazil protests, Messi) By Keith Weir HERZOGENAURACH, Germany, June 18 (Reuters) - German sportswear maker Adidas AG forecast record sales for its soccer business in 2014, aiming to retain market leadership in the sport ahead of U.S. rival Nike Inc in a soccer World Cup year. Adidas and Nike dominate a market for soccer gear - replica shirts, balls and boots - estimated to be worth around 5 billion euros ($6.7 billion) annually. “It is a battle between us and Nike, not only in Brazil but the whole football world,” Adidas CEO Herbert Hainer told reporters at a news conference at the company’s headquarters in southern Germany. Setting out its targets a year before the World Cup kicks off in Brazil, Adidas said sales from its soccer division would break the 2 billion-euro barrier for the first time in 2014. Sales from its soccer business surpassed 1.7 billion euros in 2012 and are expected to remain around that level this year, despite no World Cup or European championships to stimulate demand. Adidas is official sponsor of the 2014 World Cup and will supply the match balls, referees’ kit and clothing for volunteers at venues.

172,NKE,UPDATE 2-Adidas sets new soccer sales goal in World Cup year,"* Adidas targets record soccer sales in World Cup year * Soccer market dominated by Adidas and Nike * Adidas CEO plays down concerns over Brazil protests By Keith Weir HERZOGENAURACH, Germany, June 18 (Reuters) - German sportswear maker Adidas AG forecast record sales for its soccer business in 2014, aiming to retain market leadership in the sport ahead of U.S. rival Nike Inc in a soccer World Cup year. Adidas and Nike dominate a market for soccer kit - replica shirts, balls and boots - estimated to be worth around 5 billion euros ($6.7 billion) annually. “It is a battle between us and Nike, not only in Brazil but the whole football world,” Adidas CEO Herbert Hainer told reporters at a news conference at the company’s headquarters in southern Germany. Setting out its targets a year before the World Cup kicks off in Brazil, Adidas said sales from its soccer division would break the 2 billion euro barrier for the first time in 2014. Sales from its soccer business surpassed 1.7 billion euros in 2012 and are expected to remain around that level this year, despite no World Cup or European championships to stimulate demand. Adidas is official sponsor of the 2014 World Cup and will supply the match balls, referees’ kit and clothing for volunteers at venues. Nike sponsors the host nation Brazil, the five-times world champions and one of the most popular national teams around the globe. Nike, the world’s largest sportswear group, has recently agreed kit supply deals with France and England, two former World Cup winners.

173,NKE,Cambodian garment workers charged over strike violence,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Sixteen Cambodian garment workers and union representatives have been charged with inciting violence and damaging property during a strike for higher pay at a factory making clothes for U.S. sportswear company Nike, a lawyer said on Tuesday. Low-cost labor has attracted Western brands to Cambodia and garments now account for around 75 percent of exports from the Southeast Asian country, but strikes over pay and working conditions have become common. Up to 4,000 workers at Sabrina (Cambodia) Garment Manufacturing Co, which employs more than 5,000 people, went on strike on May 21. Police intervened to end protests on May 27 and on June 3, when some strikers rampaged through the factory. Lawyer Kuch Ratha told Reuters that eight workers were in custody and the other people charged were in hiding. “The court has denied our request for bail for the eight,” he said. The Free Trade Union (FTU), which is active at the Sabrina plant, said last week that 288 workers had been fired on June 6 and 7 for going on strike. Sabrina said in a statement on Tuesday that only 62 employees had been dismissed and that was for violent conduct during the stoppage, not for just going on strike. “Sabrina (Cambodia) Garment Manufacturing Co. regrets having to take this action but feels strongly that threats to our workers’ safety, property damage and violence cannot be ignored,” it said. The strikers wanted Sabrina to give them $14 a month to help pay for transport, rent and healthcare on top of their $74 minimum wage. Sabrina says it already pays more than the minimum. The FTU said about 300 members remained on strike as the company had not met their demands. Sabrina said a state mediation body, the Strike Prevention Committee, had declared the strike over. Some 94 employees had not shown up for work and were considered to have given up their jobs, but it would welcome an application if they wanted to come back. FTU President Chea Mony said those who had stayed away did so because they feared they would be implicated in the violence. “This is discrimination against the union — Sabrina doesn’t want another union inside the factory,” Chea Mony said. Members of the rival Coalition of Cambodian Apparel Workers’ Democratic Union did not take part in the strike. The International Labour Organization (ILO) monitors pay and working conditions at many factories in Cambodia but strikes and sometimes violent protests have been on the rise as unions emboldened by a shortage of skilled workers push for higher wages and improved safety. Strikes by the more than 300,000 garment workers in the country nearly quadrupled last year to 134, industry body the Garment Manufacturers’ Association of Cambodia says. The 48 strikes this year already exceed those in the whole of 2010 or 2011.

176,NKE,"Nike profit rises, North American orders jump","(Reuters) - Nike Inc (NKE.N) on Thursday posted a higher quarterly profit and said advance orders for its clothes and shoes had jumped, particularly in North America. Shares were up 3.2 percent to $64.30 in after-hours trading. Orders for Nike-branded shoes and clothing scheduled for delivery between June and November 2013, a gauge of demand Nike calls “futures orders,” rose 8 percent globally. Those orders were up 12 percent in North America, by far Nike’s biggest market, assuaging concerns on Wall Street that it could not keep up the pace of growth of recent quarters. “There had been a lot of concern that North America would slow, but that hasn’t happened. North America continues to show unbelievable growth,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough told Reuters. But in China, stripping out the effect of currency fluctuations, they were flat, a disappointment after rising last quarter, when investors thought Nike’s business was improving there at last. China accounts for about 11 percent of the Nike brand’s sales, but 22 percent of its profit. In China, Nike has grappled with excess inventory and intense competition from rivals cutting prices, pinching its business, and the company is trying to improve its business there. “The reset requires discipline and patience. The race in China is a marathon, it’s not a sprint,” Nike Chief Executive Mark Parker told investors. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, revenues were flat in Western Europe and up in Eastern Europe and Japan. In China, sales fell 1 percent. Sales of basketball gear and running gear rose the most among Nike’s product categories. For the quarter ended May 31, the company earned $668 million, or 76 cents a share, compared with $549 million, or 60 cents a share last year. That was 2 cents better than Wall Street analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Nike’s gross profit margin rose 1.1 percentage points to 43.9 percent of sales, jumping for the second quarter in a row after two years of declines. The company was helped by earlier price increases and lower cotton costs. Total revenue rose 7.4 percent to $6.7 billion, slightly above expectations.

179,NKE,British team switches to Nike from Adidas in seven-year deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. sportswear company Nike will provide kit to the British athletics team until 2020, winning the contract after a legal battle involving current supplier Adidas. The new agreement will take effect from January1 and will include the world athletics championships to be hosted in London in 2017. “The scale and length of their commitment is significant and demonstrates their confidence in the future of British Athletics,” said UK Athletics chief executive Niels de Vos, welcoming the deal with Nike, the world’s largest sportswear company. Media reports said the contract was worth 15 million pounds ($23.44 million), double the current deal. Athletics is enjoying its highest profile in Britain since the 1980s following the excitement generated by the London Olympics last year. Adidas lost a legal challenge to the planned switch to Nike. A court in the Netherlands where the case was filed dismissed an argument that it had the right to match any rival offer. “Adidas is disappointed with the court’s decision because we believed an agreement had been reached to continue the partnership,” the German company said in a statement. Adidas, the world’s second largest sportswear group, remains the kit supplier for the British Olympic team.

Encouraging economic data from China reinforced the view the world’s second-largest economy was stabilizing and gave investors further reason to buy. All 10 S&P; industry sectors ended higher, though energy  was pressured by a drop in crude oil prices. Tech shares  also came off their highs as Apple Inc fell sharply, weighing on the S&P; and Nasdaq. Analysts said new developments about Syria reduced risk for  financial markets as Syria accepted a Russian proposal to give up chemical weapons and win a reprieve from U.S. military strikes. “Several things continue to calm investors and make equities look attractive,” said Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management in New York. “The new proposal creates a potential scenario where the U.S. doesn’t have to go in militarily. We were worried not just about Syria, but also the impact that this would spread to other nations in the Middle East.” After the S&P; 500 posted its worst monthly performance since May 2012 in August, the broad index has rallied 3.1 percent over the past six straight sessions of gains. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 127.94 points, or 0.85 percent, at 15,191.06. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 12.28 points, or 0.73 percent, at 1,683.99. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 22.84 points, or 0.62 percent, at 3,729.02. Geopolitical uncertainty has driven market movement in recent weeks, with investors especially watching global oil prices for any sign that military action could constrain supply. With that threat seemingly less likely, oil prices fell 2 percent on Tuesday. Shares of Apple fell 2.3 percent to $494.65 after the company’s latest product unveilings, which included two new versions of its iPhone line. About 6.5 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, above the daily average so far this year of about 6.24 billion shares. About 64 percent of companies traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed higher on Tuesday while 64 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares ended up. Economic data in China showed stronger-than-expected industrial output while retail sales grew at the fastest pace this year. “Investors were worried about how far China would have to fall until it found some kind of economic equilibrium, and it looks like it found the level,” said Zemsky, who helps oversee $180 billion. “That calms fears that the major sources of growth are still out there and not sputtering along.” S&P; Dow Jones Indices announced the biggest shake-up for the Dow Jones Industrial Average in almost a decade, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Visa Inc and Nike Inc  replacing Bank of America Corp, Hewlett-Packard Co  and Alcoa Inc, respectively.

Alcoa lost 0.4 percent to $8.05, Bank of America added 0.9 percent to $14.61 and HP shed 0.4 percent to $22.27. McDonald’s Corp gained 0.5 percent to $96.89 after the fast-food restaurant chain reported a higher-than-expected 1.9 percent increase in global sales at established restaurants in August.

181,NKE,Brighter days may await stocks leaving Dow industrials,"NEW YORK, Sept 10 (Reuters) - The big shakeup in the Dow Jones industrial average’s membership may yield some surprising results when it comes to stock performance. By one measure, at least, the index’s three “has-beens” - Hewlett-Packard Co, Alcoa Inc and Bank of America Corp - look like they have significantly more upside potential than do the newcomers: Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Visa Inc <V. n> and Nike Inc. An invitation to join the Dow has not always been a sign of good things to come for a company’s shareholders, but getting the boot from the index has by no means meant disaster either. Former Dow components such as Honeywell International Inc , Altria Group Inc <Mo. n>, Monde International Inc  and Kraft Foods Group Inc have prospered since leaving the Dow. At the same time, other former Dow stocks, among them Citigroup Inc <C. n>, General Motors Co, AIG International Group Inc and Eastman Kodak, have struggled mightily. Citigroup is down roughly 90 percent in the last decade, when its share price is adjusted for a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, and Kodak is just trying to survive. UnitedHealth Group Inc <Unh. n> and Chevron Corp  have out gained the Dow since being added as components. And tech powerhouses Microsoft and Intel Corp  are essentially unchanged in price over the past decade, while the Dow 30 has risen more than 50 percent. Alcoa, Hewlett-Packard and Bank of America, on average, are undervalued by more than 30 percent, according to a valuation metric used by Thomson Reuters StarMine. By contrast, Star Mine’s so-called intrinsic value for Goldman Sachs, Visa and Nike implies these three, on average, offer little to no upside from their current stock prices. Goldman is the only one of the three new components with the potential for gain, according to StarMine. The investment bank, at $164.35 a share on Tuesday, trades at a discount of roughly 30 percent to its intrinsic value of $235.67, a potential 43 percent gain if the model proves accurate. Nike, at $66.41, and Visa, at $183.69, are overvalued by 20 percent and 25 percent, respectively, according to StarMine. Intrinsic value gauges a company’s current stock price against its long-term earnings potential as estimated by the most accurate analysts covering the stock. By this measure, the best pick of former Dow components is Hewlett-Packard, which StarMine estimates has an intrinsic value of $44.70 a share, compared with Tuesday’s price of $22.20, a potential gain of more than 100 percent. Bank of America, meanwhile, could rise 63 percent from its current $14.64. According to StarMine projections, its intrinsic value is $23.83. Even Alcoa, which hasn’t had a stock price north of $10 since May 2012, is seen having a potential gain of roughly 6 percent from its current price of $8.05, the lowest of any current Dow component.",9102013,http://www.reuters.com/article/dowchanges-performance/brighter-days-may-await-stocks-leaving-dow-industrials-idUSL2N0H619620130910
182,NKE,Dow Jones index announces biggest shake-up in a decade,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the biggest shake-up of the Dow Jones industrial average in nearly a decade, Goldman Sachs, Visa and Nike will join the storied 30-stock index, with Bank of America, which just two years ago was the largest U.S. bank by assets, one of the names exiting the Dow. The three newcomers - an investment bank, credit card payment processor and apparel company, respectively - will also replace Alcoa, in the index since 1959, and Hewlett-Packard Co. The changes will take effect at the opening of trading September 23, said S&P; Dow Jones Indices, whose index committee makes decisions on the make-up of the average. With the changes, the committee again passed on a chance to include Apple Inc and Google Inc, the first- and third-largest U.S. companies by market value. Apple stock trades above $500 and Google closed Monday above $888. “We looked at a handful above $200, Google and Apple among them,” said David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the S&P; Index Committee. “Those are obviously well-known, blue-chip, global companies. Both won’t work in the Dow because of their price.” The Dow, created in 1896, is still considered Main Street’s view of the stock market, even though its method of weighting stocks by price, rather than market value has kept out names like those two, among the most important U.S. companies, because of the outsized influence the stocks would have on the average. Blitzer said S&P; Dow Jones Indices has discussed changes to its methodology and would likely talk about it again. “It’s the most recognizable index in the world, but there’s almost no money in it,” said Dave Nadig, President of ETF analytics at IndexUniverse LLC. Even though S&P; Dow Jones Indices classifies Visa Inc as a technology name, adding the nation’s largest credit-card processor along with Goldman Sachs Group Inc reflects a further tilt toward financial services. Bank of America’s run in the Dow was not one for the history books. The stock joined the index in February 2008, just a few months into what became the worst U.S. recession since the Great Depression. The stock is down more than 65 percent since it joined the Dow. The company was engulfed by the financial and housing crisis after it acquired sub-prime mortgage originator Countrywide Financial in January 2008. The bank said Tuesday being removed from the index “has no impact on our business or our strategy for providing solid returns to shareholders.” With a market value of about $157 billion, it becomes - other than Apple and Google - the biggest U.S. company not included in the average. Nike Inc’s addition marks the first inclusion of an apparel maker since International Shoe was replaced in 1933, according to S&P; Dow Jones Indices records. Following the announcement, Visa shares were up 2.9 percent at $183.68, Goldman rose 3.6 percent to $165.21 and Nike added 1.7 percent to $66.51 after earlier hitting $66.98, a record high. The Dow was up 0.7 percent on the day. The changes announced Tuesday are the first in nearly a year, after UnitedHealth Group replaced Kraft’s spinoff Mondelez International in September 2012. Just $30 to $35 billion is indexed against the Dow, according to Blitzer, just a fraction of the roughly $1.6 trillion indexed to the S&P; 500. “It is certainly a retail (investor) number, when people talk about the Dow,” said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. Funds that attempt to replicate major indexes make up a large part of the U.S. stock market. Because they are designed to mimic market performance at a low cost, they have become among the most popular investment vehicles for investors. “Most of the money is being managed toward the broader indices so I don’t think you have that much in the way of tracking. I don’t think it’s as important as when there is an S&P; (change),” Saluzzi said, referring to when index funds buy companies added to an index and sell those that are removed. The Dow’s 30-stock membership is generally considered too small for a broad-based mutual fund, and the priced-weighted design is problematic because smaller companies with higher share prices can exert disproportionate influence. Presently, IBM, the highest-price stock in the average, accounts for more than 9 percent of the index, even though it is the eighth-largest by market value. The additions of Visa and Goldman partly tame the heavy IBM influence. IBM’s weighting in the Dow will drop to about 8 percent from 9.4 percent, and Visa and Goldman will account for 7.7 and 6.9 percent of the average, according to Birinyi Associates. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF, a trust that tracks the Dow’s performance, has net assets of $11.9 billion, ranking it in the top 30 among U.S. ETFs, according to Thomson Reuters data. The largest ETF, the SPDR S&P; 500 ETF, has $143.9 billion in assets. In volume terms the Dow ETF, previously known as the Diamonds Trust, ranks 35th among the most actively traded ETFs with a 50-day average of 5.4 million shares exchanging hands. The SPY averages 106 million shares traded daily. The three stocks slated to join the Dow have outperformed the blue-chip index’s 14.9 percent gain in 2013 to Monday’s close. Visa had gained 17.8 percent, Goldman 25 percent and Nike 26.7 percent. Of the stocks that will leave, Alcoa had underperformed the index, with a 6.9 percent year-to-date fall. Bank of America was up nearly 25 percent and HP had jumped 57 percent. Alcoa said being dropped from the Dow would not affect its ability to carry out its strategy. It seen as a candidate for elimination for some time, with its market cap of $8.7 billion easily the lowest in the average.

183,NKE,UPDATE 3-Dow Jones index announces biggest shake-up in a decade,"* Goldman Sachs, Visa, Nike new members of century-old average * Bank of America ends turbulent five years in blue chip index * Aluminum company Alcoa exits after more than 50 years * Just $30-$35 bln in funds tracks ‘well known’ Dow By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, Sept 10 (Reuters) - In the biggest shake-up of the Dow Jones industrial average in nearly a decade, Goldman Sachs, Visa and Nike will join the storied 30-stock index, with Bank of America, which just two years ago was the largest U.S. bank by assets, one of the names exiting the Dow. The three newcomers - an investment bank, credit card payment processor and apparel company, respectively - will also replace Alcoa, in the index since 1959, and Hewlett-Packard Co. The changes will take effect at the opening of trading Sept. 23, said S&P; Dow Jones Indices, whose index committee makes decisions on the make-up of the average. With the changes, the committee again passed on a chance to include Apple Inc and Google Inc, the first- and third-largest U.S. companies by market value. Apple stock trades above $500 and Google closed Monday above $888. “We looked at a handful above $200, Google and Apple among them,” said David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the S&P; Index Committee. “Those are obviously well-known, blue-chip, global companies. Both won’t work in the Dow because of their price.” The Dow, created in 1896, is still considered Main Street’s view of the stock market, even though its method of weighting stocks by price, rather than market value has kept out names like those two, among the most important U.S. companies, because of the outsized influence the stocks would have on the average. Blitzer said S&P; Dow Jones Indices has discussed changes to its methodology and would likely talk about it again. “It’s the most recognizable index in the world, but there’s almost no money in it,” said Dave Nadig, President of ETF analytics at IndexUniverse LLC. Even though S&P; Dow Jones Indices classifies Visa Inc  as a technology name, adding the nation’s largest credit-card processor along with Goldman Sachs Group Inc reflects a further tilt toward financial services. Bank of America’s run in the Dow was not one for the history books. The stock joined the index in February 2008, just a few months into what became the worst U.S. recession since the Great Depression. The stock is down more than 65 percent since it joined the Dow. The company was engulfed by the financial and housing crisis after it acquired sub-prime mortgage originator Countrywide Financial in January 2008. The bank said Tuesday being removed from the index “has no impact on our business or our strategy for providing solid returns to shareholders.” With a market value of about $157 billion, it becomes - other than Apple and Google - the biggest U.S. company not included in the average. Nike Inc’s addition marks the first inclusion of an apparel maker since International Shoe was replaced in 1933, according to S&P; Dow Jones Indices records. Following the announcement, Visa shares were up 2.9 percent at $183.68, Goldman rose 3.6 percent to $165.21 and Nike added 1.7 percent to $66.51 after earlier hitting $66.98, a record high. The Dow was up 0.7 percent on the day. The changes announced Tuesday are the first in nearly a year, after UnitedHealth Group replaced Kraft’s spinoff Mondelez International in September 2012. Just $30 to $35 billion is indexed against the Dow, according to Blitzer, just a fraction of the roughly $1.6 trillion indexed to the S&P; 500. “It is certainly a retail (investor) number, when people talk about the Dow,” said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. Funds that attempt to replicate major indexes make up a large part of the U.S. stock market. Because they are designed to mimic market performance at a low cost, they have become among the most popular investment vehicles for investors. “Most of the money is being managed toward the broader indices so I don’t think you have that much in the way of tracking. I don’t think it’s as important as when there is an S&P; (change),” Saluzzi said, referring to when index funds buy companies added to an index and sell those that are removed. The Dow’s 30-stock membership is generally considered too small for a broad-based mutual fund, and the priced-weighted design is problematic because smaller companies with higher share prices can exert disproportionate influence. Presently, IBM, the highest-price stock in the average, accounts for more than 9 percent of the index, even though it is the eighth-largest by market value. The additions of Visa and Goldman partly tame the heavy IBM influence. IBM’s weighting in the Dow will drop to about 8 percent from 9.4 percent, and Visa and Goldman will account for 7.7 and 6.9 percent of the average, according to Birinyi Associates. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF, a trust that tracks the Dow’s performance, has net assets of $11.9 billion, ranking it in the top 30 among U.S. ETFs, according to Thomson Reuters data. The largest ETF, the SPDR S&P; 500 ETF , has $143.9 billion in assets. In volume terms the Dow ETF, previously known as the Diamonds Trust, ranks 35th among the most actively traded ETFs with a 50-day average of 5.4 million shares exchanging hands. The SPY averages 106 million shares traded daily. The three stocks slated to join the Dow have outperformed the blue-chip index’s 14.9 percent gain in 2013 to Monday’s close. Visa had gained 17.8 percent, Goldman 25 percent and Nike 26.7 percent. Of the stocks that will leave, Alcoa had underperformed the index, with a 6.9 percent year-to-date fall. Bank of America was up nearly 25 percent and HP had jumped 57 percent. Alcoa said being dropped from the Dow would not affect its ability to carry out its strategy. It seen as a candidate for elimination for some time, with its market cap of $8.7 billion easily the lowest in the average. It is the first three-for-three change to the index since April 8, 2004, when American International Group, Pfizer and Verizon replaced AT&T; Corp, Eastman Kodak and International Paper.

Also lifting the S&P; 500 index for a sixth straight day was encouraging economic data from Chinal. Nine of the 10 S&P; 500 sectors rose, the only exception being energy, which dipped with a drop in crude oil prices. Fears of action against Syria eased after U.S. President Barack Obama said Monday he saw a possible breakthrough in the situation after Russia proposed that Syria hand over its chemical weapons for destruction, a proposal Syrian Prime Minister Wael al-Halki said his country supported. While such a move could avert a potential Western-led military strike, the White House said Obama would press ahead with his plan to ask Congress to approve the use of military force against the country. “We don’t know if this is just talk or if it could happen, but right now tensions have cooled and the market likes that,” said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc in San Antonio.” The Dow Jones industrial average was up 116.90 points, or 0.78 percent, at 15,180.02. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 11.62 points, or 0.70 percent, at 1,683.33. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 21.72 points, or 0.59 percent, at 3,727.91. Geopolitical uncertainty has driven market movement in recent weeks, with investors especially watching global oil prices for any sign that military action could constrain supply. Crude fell 2.5 percent on Tuesday. Economic data in China showed stronger-than-expected industrial output while retail sales grew at the fastest pace this year, reinforcing signs that the world’s second-largest economy was stabilizing after slowing for more than two years. On Monday, Wall Street climbed following strong Chinese export data. After suffering its worst monthly performance since May 2012 in August, the S&P; has rallied 3.1 percent over the past six sessions, its longest winning streak since early July. S&P; Dow Jones Indices announced the biggest shake-up for the Dow Jones Industrial Average in almost a decade, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Visa Inc and Nike Inc  replacing Bank of American Corp,Hewlett-Packard Co  and Alcoa Inc, respectively. The changes will take effect on Sept. 23. Goldman rose 3 percent to $164.35 while Visa gained 2.5 percent to $183 and Nike advanced 2 percent to $66.71. Alcoa lost 0.1 percent to $8.07, Bank of America added 0.4 percent to $14.54 and Hewlett-Packard shed 1.5 percent to $22.02. “We’re not making any moves on the changes, but some market players will try and trade off the ones being added, attempting to get ahead of fund rebalancing,” said Matousek, who helps oversee about $1.3 billion. “Over the long term, this shouldn’t skew those names one way or the other.” McDonald’s Corp gained 0.7 percent to $97.08 after the fast-food restaurant chain reported a better-than-expected 1.9 percent increase in global sales at established restaurants in August. Urban Outfitters Inc slumped 11 percent to $38.14 after Janney Montgomery Scott cut its price target on the stock to $46 from $52.

Fears of action against Syria eased after U.S. President Barack Obama said Monday he saw a possible breakthrough in the crisis with Syria after Russia proposed that its ally Damascus hands over its chemical weapons for destruction, which could avert planned U.S. military strikes. Syrian Prime Minister Wael al-Halki said his country supported a Russian proposal for Damascus to give up chemical weapons to avoid a possible U.S. military strike. “Certainly there was the potential for escalation, which was the market’s primary concern, and that seemed to be the issue out there,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. Economic data in China showed stronger-than-expected industrial output and retail sales showed their fastest growth this year, reinforcing signs that the world’s second-largest economy was stabilizing after slowing for more than two years. “Another good China-data day and that has certainly been helping,” Ghriskey said. “Anything that is going to forestall a strike on Syria certainly gets the risk appetite back into the marketplace.” However, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama would press ahead with his plan to ask Congress to approve the use of military force in Syria, despite Syria’s recent acceptance of the Russian proposal. Oil prices pulled back, with U.S. crude off 2.1 percent. Crude prices rose 2.7 percent last week on worries a strike against Syria could spark a wider conflict and heightened supply concerns. After suffering its worst monthly performance since May 2012 in August, the S&P; 500 has rallied for the past five sessions for a 2.4 percent gain that marks its longest winning streak in two months. S&P; 500 futures rose 9.9 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures gained 79 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures added 19 points. S&P; Dow Jones Indices said Goldman Sachs Group Inc  will replace Bank of American Corp, Visa Inc will replace Hewlett-Packard Co and Nike Inc will replace Alcoa Inc in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after the close of trading Sept. 20.

187,NKE,CORRECTED-Brighter days may await stocks leaving Dow industrials,"(In paragraph 4, corrects AIG company name and stock symbols for AIG and GM) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Sept 10 (Reuters) - The big shakeup in the Dow Jones industrial average’s membership may yield some surprising results when it comes to stock performance. By one measure, at least, the index’s three “has-beens” - Hewlett-Packard Co, Alcoa Inc and Bank of America Corp look like they have significantly more upside potential than do the newcomers: Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Visa Inc and Nike Inc. An invitation to join the Dow has not always been a sign of good things to come for a company’s shareholders, but getting the boot from the index has by no means meant disaster either. Former Dow components such as Honeywell International Inc , Altria Group Inc, Monde International Inc  and Kraft Foods Group Inc have prospered since leaving the Dow. At the same time, other former Dow stocks, among them Citigroup Inc, General Motors Co, American International Group Inc and Eastman Kodak Co, have struggled mightily. Citigroup is down roughly 90 percent in the last decade, when its share price is adjusted for a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, and Kodak is just trying to survive. UnitedHealth Group Inc and Chevron Corp have out gained the Dow since being added as components. And tech powerhouses Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp  are essentially unchanged in price over the past decade, while the Dow 30 has risen more than 50 percent. Alcoa, Hewlett-Packard and Bank of America, on average, are undervalued by more than 30 percent, according to a valuation metric used by Thomson Reuters StarMine. By contrast, StarMine’s so-called intrinsic value for Goldman Sachs, Visa and Nike implies these three, on average, offer little to no upside from their current stock prices. Goldman is the only one of the three new components with the potential for gain, according to StarMine. The investment bank, at $164.35 a share on Tuesday, trades at a discount of roughly 30 percent to its intrinsic value of $235.67, a potential 43 percent gain if the model proves accurate. Nike, at $66.41, and Visa, at $183.69, are overvalued by 20 percent and 25 percent, respectively, according to StarMine. Intrinsic value gauges a company’s current stock price against its long-term earnings potential as estimated by the most accurate analysts covering the stock. By this measure, the best pick of former Dow components is Hewlett-Packard, which StarMine estimates has an intrinsic value of $44.70 a share, compared with Tuesday’s price of $22.20, a potential gain of more than 100 percent. Bank of America, meanwhile, could rise 63 percent from its current $14.64. According to StarMine projections, its intrinsic value is $23.83. Even Alcoa, which hasn’t had a stock price north of $10 since May 2012, is seen having a potential gain of roughly 6 percent from its current price of $8.05, the lowest of any current Dow component.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped last week near a six-year low, the Labor Department said, which could bode well for employers adding workers to their payrolls. Other data on housing and consumer prices were less positive signs of the recovery. But the encouraging jobless claims data comes shortly before September’s unemployment report, which will be important input for the Federal Reserve as it decides when to change monetary policy. “If today’s number was a good number, that means when we see the job report on Oct. 4, that number ought to be pretty strong,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York. “That’s going to give us another clue as to the underlying strength of the labor market, which was one of the reasons the Federal Reserve chose not to commence the taper.” Consumer discretionary shares gave the biggest boost to the S&P; 500, which was up for the first session since the Sept. 18 rally on the Fed’s decision to keep its stimulus program unchanged for now. The S&P; consumer discretionary index  rose 0.9 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 55.04 points, or 0.36 percent, at 15,328.30. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was up 5.90 points, or 0.35 percent, at 1,698.67. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 26.33 points, or 0.70 percent, at 3,787.43. The Dow and S&P; 500 rose after five straight sessions of losses, while the Nasdaq closed just shy of a high last seen about 13 years ago. In Washington, House Republicans refused to give in to President Barack Obama’s demands for straightforward bills to keep the government running beyond Sept. 30 and to increase borrowing authority to avoid a historic default. Congress, struggling to avert a government shutdown next week, was warned by the Obama administration that the Treasury was quickly running out of funds to pay government bills and could soon face a damaging debt default. Another threat to the recovering economy was the prospect of federal agencies shutting down beginning on Tuesday with the new fiscal year unless Congress comes up with emergency funds. Among top percentage gainers on the Nasdaq, Bed Bath and Beyond rose 4.5 percent to $77.54, a day after it reported a jump in second-quarter profit as the U.S. housing market recovery spurred demand. After the bell, shares of Nike Inc jumped 4.1 percent to $73.20 following the release of its results. It was the first earnings report of the season for the retailer as a member of the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average. The stock ended the regular session up 2.1 percent at $70.34. During regular trading, shares of J.C. Penney Co Inc  gained 2.9 percent to $10.24 after CNBC reported its chief executive told investors he does not see the need to raise cash this year. But after the close, the stock slid 5.5 percent to $9.85 after it said it had begun a public offering of 84 million shares. On Wednesday, the stock hit a 13-year low after Goldman Sachs said it expects sales at the troubled department store chain to improve more slowly than expected. Among Thursday’s decliners, Eli Lilly lost 3 percent to $51.04 and was among the biggest drags on the S&P; 500 after its experimental cancer drug failed to improve survival among breast cancer patients without their cancer worsening in a late-stage trial. Hertz Global shares tumbled 16.1 percent to $21.63 after the car rental company cut its full-year forecast. For the third quarter, year-over-year S&P; 500 earnings are expected to have risen 4.8 percent, down sharply from a July 1 forecast for earnings growth of 8.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Other economic data on Thursday showed the U.S. government left unchanged its estimate for economic growth in the second quarter at 2.5 percent. Volume totaled about 5.4 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the NYSE MKT, below the average daily closing volume of about 6.3 billion this year.

190,NKE,UPDATE 1-Nike revenue surges in North America and Europe,"Sept 26 (Reuters) - Nike Inc enjoyed big sales in gains in North America and Europe last quarter and benefited from fewer markdowns, helping the maker of sports clothes and shoes report a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit. Total revenue rose 7.7 percent to $6.97 billion, and global orders for delivery later this year, which the company calls “futures orders,” rose 10 percent excluding currency impact, suggesting Nike’s hot streak will continue. Nike shares rose 5.7 percent to $74.35 in after-hours trading. Including those gains, shares are up 13.7 percent since the announcement earlier this month that Nike would join the Dow Jones industrial average. Nike revenue in North America rose 9 percent, and in Western Europe, where many retailers have struggled with a pullback by consumers, sales grew 8 percent. The company earned $780 million, or 86 cents a share, in its fiscal first quarter, ended Aug. 31, compared with $567 million, or 63 cents a share, last year. Analysts expected a profit of 78 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Nike’s gross margin rose 1.2 points to 44.9 percent of sales, helped by lower cotton costs and fewer markdowns. The company had forecast gross margin to be unchanged. Futures orders for delivery between this month and January 2014 rose 12 percent in both Europe and North America.

Penney stock slides after pricing of offering * Nike shares jump a day after strong earnings * Indexes off: Dow 0.5 pct, S&P; 0.4 pct, Nasdaq 0.2 pct By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks declined on Friday and the S&P; 500 and Dow posted their first weekly drop in four, as Democrat and Republican lawmakers struggled to agree on an emergency funding bill to avert a U.S. government shutdown days away. The S&P; 500 declined 1.1 percent for the week and is roughly 2 percent below its record high set Sept. 18 when the Federal Reserve announced it would keep its stimulus program unchanged for the present. Time was running short for lawmakers to avert a partial shutdown of operations by the U.S. government on Oct. 1. Republicans in the House want to use the spending legislation to gut the new healthcare overhaul, a goal of the conservative Tea Party. The Senate passed the emergency funding bill on Friday, which will keep U.S. agencies operating after Sept. 30. The measure must now be approved by the Republican-controlled House where it is expected to encounter rough going. The House could vote on a bill in an unusual Saturday or Sunday session. “I think investors right now are contemplating what is the impact on consumer confidence, revenues and earnings if Washington gets caught up in a quagmire,” said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist at D.A. Davidson & Co. in Lake Oswego, Oregon. Eight of the 10 S&P; 500 sectors ended lower, with the materials sector leading losses on the index. The S&P; materials index declined 1.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 70.06 points, or 0.46 percent, at 15,258.24. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 6.92 points, or 0.41 percent, at 1,691.75. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 5.83 points, or 0.15 percent, at 3,781.59. For the week, the Dow was down 1.3 percent and the Nasdaq was up 0.2 percent. Just before the close, President Barack Obama urged House Republicans to avoid a government shutdown without cuts to his healthcare law or other conditions. He said he would not agree to delaying or defunding the new healthcare reform law, and that the Senate acted responsibly earlier in the day to keep the government open. Shares of J.C.Penney fell 13.1 percent to $9.05 and was the worst percentage decliner on the S&P; 500 after it said its public offering of 84 million common shares was priced at $9.65 per share. Shares of Lumber Liquidators Holdings declined 5.2 percent to $107.13 after the company said it was cooperating with authorities after federal agents searched its headquarters and another office in a probe of the import of certain wood flooring products. Among gainers, Nike Inc jumped 4.7 percent to $73.64, giving the Dow its biggest boost, a day after the maker of sports clothes and shoes reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit. The latest Fed officials to comment on stimulus measures  included Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans, who said the Fed could start reducing its asset purchases this year based on economic forecasts, but the decision to wind back stimulus could be pushed into next year. Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota told Reuters the Fed needs to speak more clearly and tell the world it will do “whatever it takes” to boost employment. The day’s economic data showed U.S. household spending rose in August as incomes increased at the fastest pace in six months, a sign that momentum could be picking up in the U.S. economy.

Penney stock slides after pricing of offering * Nike shares jump a day after strong earnings * Indexes off: Dow 0.5 pct, S&P; 0.5 pct, Nasdaq 0.2 pct By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks declined on Friday, putting the S&P; 500 and Dow on track for their first weekly drop in four, as congressional Democrats and Republicans struggled to pass a federal budget to avert a government shutdown days away. The S&P; 500 is roughly 2 percent below its record high set Sept. 18 when the Federal Reserve announced it would keep its stimulus program unchanged for now. Time was running short for lawmakers to avert a partial shutdown of operations by the U.S. government on Oct. 1. Republicans in the House want to use the spending legislation to gut the new healthcare overhaul, a goal of the conservative Tea Party. The Senate passed the emergency funding bill on Friday, which will keep U.S. agencies operating after Sept. 30. The measure must now be approved by the Republican-controlled House where it is expected to encounter rough going. Congress has scheduled sessions during the weekend. “As we get closer to decision day and something happening, you get that concern that maybe something won’t happen and how will the market react,” said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc., an investment advisory firm based in Toledo, Ohio. “People are pulling in their horns a little bit.” All 10 S&P; 500 sectors were trading lower, with S&P; 500 materials among the biggest losers. In the latest comments by Fed officials on stimulus,  Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said the Fed could start reducing its asset purchases this year based on economic forecasts, but the decision to wind back stimulus could be pushed into next year. Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota told Reuters the Fed needs to speak more clearly and tell the world it will do “whatever it takes” to boost employment and not send the message that a very slow drop in joblessness is satisfactory. New York Fed President William Dudley said the labor market is not yet healthy and inflation should firm in the months ahead. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 80.40 points, or 0.52 percent, at 15,247.90. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 8.10 points, or 0.48 percent, at 1,690.57.

The S&P; is roughly 2 percent below its record high set last week and is facing resistance at its 14-day moving average, now at about 1,699. Time was running short for lawmakers to avert a partial shutdown of operations by the U.S. government on Oct. 1 as Congress struggled to pass an emergency spending bill Republicans want to use to achieve Tea Party-backed goals, such as defunding the new healthcare reform law. The Senate on Friday was on track to pass legislation to keep the federal government operating beyond midnight Monday. “I’ve seen the movie almost every couple of years, the movie always ends the same way - the politicians figure it out at the last minute,” said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. “Markets gets all scared in the meantime.” In the latest comments from Fed officials after last week’s surprise decision by the central bank to preserve its stimulus measures, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Charles Evans, said the Fed could start reducing its asset purchases this year based on economic forecasts but the decision to wind back stimulus could be pushed into next year. Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota told Reuters the Fed needs to speak more clearly and tell the world it will do “whatever it takes” to boost employment, and not send the message that a very slow drop in joblessness is satisfactory. Later in the session, influential New York Fed President William Dudley will speak on the economy in Syracuse, New York at 2:00 p.m. (1800 GMT). The Dow Jones industrial average fell 73.99 points or 0.48 percent, to 15,254.31, the S&P; 500 lost 6.27 points or 0.37 percent, to 1,692.4 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 0.799 points or 0.02 percent, to 3,786.628.

The S&P; is about 2 percent below its record high set last week and is facing resistance at its 50-day moving average, now near 1,699. Congress has yet to forge an agreement that would keep the U.S. government running and avoid a debt default. Investors are concerned about the implications of a shutdown and possible default on an already-fragile economic recovery. “The two sides seem a little more steadfast in their positions this time,” said Jack De Gan, chief investment officer at Harbor Advisory Corp in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. He said the S&P; has pulled back in a consolidation move from its record, and after Congress reaches a deal, it will continue to move higher. “We all know they have to (compromise) and the market knows that, so I don’t think it’s being too complacent,” he said. The Republican-controlled House and the Democratic Senate are bouncing back bills, with each party anxious to pin responsibility for any economic damage on the other. Meanwhile, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Charles Evans, said the Fed could start reducing its asset purchases this year based on economic forecasts but the decision to wind back stimulus could be pushed into next year. Several Federal Reserve officials are due to speak Friday, and markets will examine their remarks with interest for clarity on the immediate future of the Fed’s stimulus program which has propped up the economy and equity markets this year.

202,NKE,U.S. nuclear arms modernization plan misguided: scientists' group,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An Obama administration plan to spend $60 billion over the next 25 years to modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal is misguided and violates the spirit of its pledge not to develop new nuclear arms, a Union of Concerned Scientists report said on Thursday. The 81-page report by the independent nonprofit said the $60 billion for upgrading warheads is a fraction of what Washington plans to spend on its nuclear deterrent in the coming decades, on top of billions for new manufacturing facilities and billions more for delivery systems like submarines. The spending comes despite President Barack Obama’s endorsement of the goal of a world without nuclear weapons and his negotiation of the “New START” treaty with Russia, which committed the former Cold War rivals to reducing deployed strategic nuclear weapons to 1,550 each by 2018. But Obama also has insisted that the United States must be confident that its remaining weapons will work as it attempts negotiate smaller and smaller nuclear arsenals with other atomic weapons states. And he has come under pressure from Republicans to address the problems of the aging U.S. nuclear complex. The Pentagon and the National Nuclear Security Administration, which is responsible for the maintenance and reliability of the arsenal, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report. The United States produced its last nuclear weapon, based on 1970s technology, in 1990 and halted underground nuclear testing in 1992. Since then it has relied on computer simulation for testing and has refurbished older weapons to extend their life. But concern about security and reliability has prompted the NNSA and the Pentagon to push for additional efforts to modernize the weapons. A plan released in June by the NNSA, which is part of the Department of Energy, calls for a new manufacturing complex to reconfigure and upgrade the arms. The United States has seven warhead types. The new program would reduce the number of types and make some interchangeable on different weapons. There would be three warhead types for long-range missiles and two for bombs and cruise missiles. “NNSA’s plan violates the spirit if not the letter of the administration’s pledge to not develop new nuclear weapons. It sends the wrong message to the rest of the world,” said Philip Coyle, a researcher at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation who co-authored the report. Lisbeth Gronlund, a co-director of UCS’s Global Security Program who worked on the report, said in an interview that modernization efforts by NNSA could undermine confidence in the reliability of the arsenal. Weapons in the U.S. arsenal have elements for a primary and secondary explosion. Under the new approach, Gronlund said, some primary and secondary elements would be mixed and matched, even though they may not have been physically tested together. “People could well raise this as a concern and suggest we need to resume testing,” she said. “So I don’t see any reason to go down that road.” Gronlund said the idea behind moving to a smaller number of interchangeable warheads was that it would make it easier to reduce the size of the nuclear “hedge,” the non-deployed warheads that are held in reserve. The United States is thought to have as many as 2,650 non-deployed warheads, plus about 3,000 waiting to be dismantled, according to The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. “The claim is that this (modernization) would allow them to eventually reduce the hedge,” Gronlund said, but that would only be done after 25 years, which she described as “a little lame.” With the United States already cutting deployed warheads under New START, it is a “very realistic assumption” that Washington would reduce the number of non-deployed weapons over the next 25 years as well, she said.

203,NKE,"UPDATE 3-Adidas says soccer, running to help it beat Nike in Europe","* Q3 sales 3.88 bln euros vs Reuters poll average 3.92 bln * Q3 operating profit 463 mln euros vs poll average 466 mln * Soccer boots, jerseys, running products to take on Nike * Nike takes market share from Adidas in Europe * Shares rise 3.5 pct, outperform DAX By Victoria Bryan FRANKFURT, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Adidas forecast a $2.7 billion boost to sales from next year’s soccer World Cup would help it over a tough 2013, and said it would fend off rival Nike in hotly-contested European markets with innovative running gear. Adidas, the world’s No. 2 maker of sportswear and accessories, has struggled this year to maintain momentum after a big boost in 2012 from the Olympics and European soccer championship, and warned in September sales and profits would not rise as much as expected. The company confirmed on Thursday that third quarter operating profit dropped 6 percent and sales fell 7 percent, hurt by distribution problems in Russia, a currency hit in North America and Japan, and poor sales of golfing products. To make matters worse, Adidas lost market share to Nike on its European home turf. It had 13.2 percent of the western European sporting goods market to Nike’s 12.4 percent in 2012, according to data from Euromonitor. Nike reported an 8 percent rise in sales in western Europe in its fiscal first quarter to the end of August, while Adidas posted a fall of 6 percent at constant currencies in its third quarter. Adidas Chief Executive Herbert Hainer denied a recent report that Nike had overtaken Adidas in terms of soccer sales in Germany and vowed to defend the group’s prize business. “We have a lot of ammunition to fight back,” he told journalists, noting that increased levels of World Cup stock - jerseys and match balls - are now being shipped out ahead of release in a couple of weeks. Adidas will also launch more soccer shoes with the help of Barcelona star Lionel Messi who fronts its new range of brightly coloured Samba boots. The sportswear firm traditionally performs well in years with major sporting events. Its forecast for soccer sales of more than 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion) in 2014 would be a record and an increase of a third compared with 1.5 billion in the last World Cup year. Shares in Adidas, which hit a record high of 88.50 euros in August, were up 3.5 percent and outperforming a flat wider market at 1135 GMT as investors welcomed results as forecast and looked to better earnings next year. “All the bad news (is) on the table now,” DZ Bank analyst Herbert Sturm said, referring to the company’s earlier profit warning. “We expect a series of positive news flow in the next months to come.” Chief Financial Officer Robin Stalker explained a 6 percent jump in inventories by saying the group had already increased stock levels ahead of an expected upturn in demand. “We anticipate sales in next three to six months to be higher than the same period last year,” he said. Aside from soccer, Hainer said Adidas was well placed to take on Nike in the running market, where it has increased sales by 14 percent so far this year. The group has launched two new running shoes this year - Boost and Springblade, the first with cushioning in the sole, the second with futuristic-looking blades on the sole. Hainer said the latter was doing well with consumers in the United States, Brazil and Russia. “We will roll it out further in 2014,” he said. In a bid to outdo Nike’s popular Fuelband fitness monitor, Adidas has also unveiled a new running watch that can track the wearer’s run, heartbeat, offer coaching tips and play music. “Losing leadership in Western Europe - their home market - would be a very tough pill to swallow,” said Euromonitor analyst Magdalena Kondej. “But they recognise the threat and they continue focusing on innovation. That puts them in a good position once European markets recover.” A bright spot was the Reebok brand, where sales rose 5 percent in the three months to end-September, the second quarter in a row of growth as a new focus on fitness pays off. Hainer also said Adidas was making “good progress” on its 2015 targets for sales of 17 billion euros and an operating margin of 11 percent, goals that had come under scrutiny after the profit warning. Third quarter sales were 3.88 billion euros and operating profit 463 million ($626 million), both slightly below the average estimates in a Reuters poll. Despite this, the group improved its gross profit margin - a key measure of profitability in the apparel industry - 1.9 percentage points to 49.3 percent on higher prices and sales in its own shops. Adidas maintained a forecast for sales to rise by a low single digit percentage in 2013 and to achieve an operating margin of around 8.5 percent.

206,NKE,Nike kick off World Cup shirt war with new Brazil kit,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Nike launched a key battle in its war for shirt supremacy on Sunday when they unveiled the kit Brazil will wear to host the 2014 World Cup.

Nike expects Brazil to be its third largest market in the world by 2017, behind only the United States and China.

208,NKE,UPDATE 1-Nike and Adidas square off for Brazil World Cup in ongoing brand battle,"By Victoria Bryan FRANKFURT, Dec 6 (Reuters) - When soccer teams battle for the World Cup in Brazil next year, another fight for global supremacy will be played out on the pitches - between Adidas and Nike. In the next round of their tussle to be the world’s biggest sports brand there is everything to play for. Nike currently owns 14.6 percent of the global sporting goods market to Adidas’ 11.4 percent, and is whittling away at the German brand’s No. 1 position in Europe. Adidas held 13.2 percent of the western European sporting goods market in 2012 to Nike’s 12.4 percent, according to Euromonitor data. “It’s not easy to evaluate (next year’s) collections. Adidas is definitely putting a lot of effort into winning lost ground, but a company like Nike won’t rest on its laurels,” said Hans Allmendinger, head of marketing for German sporting goods retailer Sport2000. Adidas has for more than 40 years decorated soccer kit and shoes with its distinctive parallel lines logo. It has strong partnerships setting it up well for the coming challenge: a close relationship with German club Bayern Munich, of which it owns 9 percent, and with FIFA, soccer’s world governing body, for whom it designs official World Cup kit. Adidas has forecast record 2014 soccer sales of over 2 billion euros and aims to boost group sales to 17 billion euros ($23 billion) in 2015. U.S. Nike, meanwhile, only entered the soccer market in 1994. But already it has several major partnerships with clubs, including English champions Manchester United. The owner of the distinctive ‘swoosh’ or tick logo, does not give forecasts for individual sport categories, but it is predicting group sales of up to $30 billion by 2015 - suggesting it thinks it can put in a sufficiently strong performance during the World Cup to stretch its global lead over the German company - and maybe beat it at home too. In Nike’s first fiscal quarter of 2013, ended Aug.31, it posted an 8 percent jump in sales in Europe. Over the same period, Adidas’ European sales fell 7 percent. Adidas is pulling out all the stops to make its presence felt in Brazil, where Nike sponsors the national team. Brazil have won the World Cup a record five times and the country is a byword for stylish soccer, meaning there is a huge buzz around the tournament - and Nike’s designs. Adidas is aiming to make its presence felt with players like Lionel Messi and Mesut Ozil, who play for Adidas-sponsored national teams Argentina and Germany - and the launch of the official match ball, the “Brazuca” - on sale for $160 but free to Brazilians born on its launch day. Given the scale of the battle however it will also be using what is politely known as “ambush marketing.” Soccer watchers cite as an early example in this year’s World Cup campaigns the launch of a new soccer top for the Palmeiras club in the yellow, green and blue worn by the Brazil national team. “That will be ruffling a few feathers,” said Berenberg Bank analyst John Guy. “They’ve certainly got a few tactical moves up their sleeves to consolidate their position against Nike and that’s good to see.” Klaus Jost, president of the world’s largest sportswear retailer Intersport, said Nike’s roster of top soccer players like Frenchman Franck Ribery and Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo was one of the reasons for Nike’s increasing sales in Europe. “It’s much more about creating the right image,” he told Reuters. “Stars like Ribery, Ronaldo and (Zlatan) Ibrahimovic have such an attraction that many kids want to copy them.” Big name endorsements are also responsible for Nike’s broader success. Retailers say the U.S. brand has gained market share this year thanks to well designed, comfortable products such as the top-selling Nike Free sneaker - and getting its performance-enhancing shoes on the feet of the biggest sports stars. Nike’s impressive roster of sponsorship deals includes current names like soccer star Ronaldo, tennis player Roger Federer, golfers Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy and legendary track and field athletes like Carl Lewis and Michael Johnson. “Nike has done a really good job of presenting themselves as the true brand for performance,” Tammy Smulder, managing director at marketing consultancy SCB Partners, told Reuters. “Nike says, ‘We will be associated with the top athletes, whatever the sport’. You can’t dispute that,” she added. Adidas chief executive Herbert Hainer said this week the group had made some mistakes, but added: “We believe we can grow the business by launching a lot of new innovative products. Our pipeline of new products is full.” One of the ways Adidas is hoping to grow sales is by using the cushioning technology in its Boost running shoes for other categories such as basketball. That could enable it to increase sales of Boost shoes to 15 million pairs in 2015, after having only introduced the line earlier this year. It has signed big names in sports other than soccer in a bid to gain market share from Nike. But its partnership with U.S. basketball star Derrick Rose has run into difficulties as a result of Rose suffering several injuries that have kept him off the court for months. The biggest challenge in the battle of the brands is to win the crown of cool - something far more difficult than simply designing a new product. At the moment, say market watchers and consultants, Nike seems to be stealing a march on Adidas thanks to early adoption of new technologies which it is then harnessing to a bigger social media presence. “They have a good hunch for the next wave that will define a generation,” Lea Simpson, strategy director at digital strategy agency TH_NK, told Reuters. “In the 1980s, it was fitness, now it’s tech and sustainability.” Nike has almost 2.5 million Twitter followers to just over 570,000 for Adidas. It also has higher Facebook engagement rates, showing its fans interact better than Adidas fans with posted content. Its Nike+ Fuelband and other apps track training and can then post results on social media sites - a far more powerful demonstration of brand involvement than a Facebook ‘like’, Simpson said. Adidas CEO Hainer said this week that the company would shift “much more money” into digital and social media. Garth Farrar, global head of digital at Repucom, noted Adidas had already been producing more Vine clips, Facebook posts and tweets over the last months. He said Adidas’ social media campaign looked geared to “give the brand more cultural relevance beyond Europe .. and help protect the brand from any ambush stunts from Nike around the World Cup.”",12062013,http://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-world-adidas-nike/update-1-nike-and-adidas-square-off-for-brazil-world-cup-in-ongoing-brand-battle-idUSL5N0JL3II20131206

Adidas is aiming to make its presence felt with players like Lionel Messi and Mesut Ozil, who play for Adidas-sponsored national teams Argentina and Germany - and the launch of the official match ball, the “Brazuca” - on sale for $160 but free to Brazilians born on its launch day. Given the scale of the battle however it will also be using what is politely known as “ambush marketing.” Soccer watchers cite as an early example in this year’s World Cup campaigns the launch of a new soccer top for the Palmeiras club in the yellow, green and blue worn by the Brazil national team. “That will be ruffling a few feathers,” said Berenberg Bank analyst John Guy. “They’ve certainly got a few tactical moves up their sleeves to consolidate their position against Nike and that’s good to see.” Klaus Jost, president of the world’s largest sportswear retailer Intersport, said Nike’s roster of top soccer players like Frenchman Franck Ribery and Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo was one of the reasons for Nike’s increasing sales in Europe. “It’s much more about creating the right image,” he told Reuters. “Stars like Ribery, Ronaldo and (Zlatan) Ibrahimovic have such an attraction that many kids want to copy them.” Big name endorsements are also responsible for Nike’s broader success. Retailers say the U.S. brand has gained market share this year thanks to well designed, comfortable products such as the top-selling Nike Free sneaker - and getting its performance-enhancing shoes on the feet of the biggest sports stars. Nike’s impressive roster of sponsorship deals includes current names like soccer star Ronaldo, tennis player Roger Federer, golfers Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy and legendary track and field athletes like Carl Lewis and Michael Johnson. “Nike has done a really good job of presenting themselves as the true brand for performance,” Tammy Smulder, managing director at marketing consultancy SCB Partners, told Reuters. “Nike says, ‘We will be associated with the top athletes, whatever the sport’. You can’t dispute that,” she added. Adidas chief executive Herbert Hainer said this week the group had made some mistakes, but added: “We believe we can grow the business by launching a lot of new innovative products. Our pipeline of new products is full.” One of the ways Adidas is hoping to grow sales is by using the cushioning technology in its Boost running shoes for other categories such as basketball. That could enable it to increase sales of Boost shoes to 15 million pairs in 2015, after having only introduced the line earlier this year. It has signed big names in sports other than soccer in a bid to gain market share from Nike. But its partnership with U.S. basketball star Derrick Rose has run into difficulties as a result of Rose suffering several injuries that have kept him off the court for months. The biggest challenge in the battle of the brands is to win the crown of cool - something far more difficult than simply designing a new product. At the moment, say market watchers and consultants, Nike seems to be stealing a march on Adidas thanks to early adoption of new technologies which it is then harnessing to a bigger social media presence. “They have a good hunch for the next wave that will define a generation,” Lea Simpson, strategy director at digital strategy agency TH_NK, told Reuters. “In the 1980s, it was fitness, now it’s tech and sustainability.” Nike has almost 2.5 million Twitter followers to just over 570,000 for Adidas. It also has higher Facebook engagement rates, showing its fans interact better than Adidas fans with posted content. Its Nike+ Fuelband and other apps track training and can then post results on social media sites - a far more powerful demonstration of brand involvement than a Facebook ‘like’, Simpson said. Adidas CEO Hainer said this week that the company would shift “much more money” into digital and social media. Garth Farrar, global head of digital at Repucom, noted Adidas had already been producing more Vine clips, Facebook posts and tweets over the last months. He said Adidas’ social media campaign looked geared to “give the brand more cultural relevance beyond Europe .. and help protect the brand from any ambush stunts from Nike around the World Cup.”",12062013,http://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-world-adidas-nike/nike-and-adidas-square-off-for-brazil-world-cup-in-ongoing-brand-battle-idUSL5N0JK2RI20131206

Puma, which is 84 percent-owned by French luxury group Kering, wants to sign up big-name players ahead of next year’s football World Cup in Brazil. The Italy striker joins a line-up of Puma sponsored stars including Argentinian footballer Sergio Aguero, Spaniard Cesc Fabregas, German Marco Reus, and Colombian Radamel Falcao. Puma, which ranks a distant third in the sports apparel industry behind Nike and Adidas, did not disclose the cost of its partnership with Balotelli. In November, Chief Executive Bjoern Gulden said the company needed to focus less on fashion, as it had done over the last two decades, and more on performance sportswear. One of Gulden’s priorities is to fix footwear sales, which fell 7.5 percent in the first nine months of the year and which he described as Puma’s “Achilles’ heel”.",12232013,http://www.reuters.com/article/puma-football-balotelli/italy-striker-balotelli-to-wear-puma-boots-in-sponsorship-deal-idUSL6N0K21Q320131223

220,NKE,Germany's Puma ousts Nike as Arsenal kit supplier,"(Reuters) - German sportswear company Puma will become the kit supplier to English soccer club Arsenal from next season in a deal worth more than 30 million pounds ($50 million) a year to the Premier League leaders. Puma has ousted U.S. group Nike which has provided Arsenal’s red and white shirts for the past two decades. The deal with Arsenal shows Puma’s determination to re-establish itself as a core sports brand under new CEO Bjoern Gulden after moving more into lifestyle and fashion. “Arsenal represents a major commercial and marketing opportunity to reinforce Puma’s credibility as a global sports brand,” Gulden said. Puma, which supplies kit to German soccer club Borussia Dortmund and national teams including Italy, said it was aiming to establish itself as the clear number-three soccer brand behind market leaders Adidas and Nike. Puma, majority owned by French luxury goods company Kering, warned in November that 2013 net profit would fall far below the 70 million euro ($96 million) figure in 2012. Gulden denied that Puma had overspent to win the Arsenal deal. “Our analysis shows this is a good deal for us,” he told Reuters. “We are convinced that this is the best deal that we could do. It’s the team that fits us, it’s a good commercial deal and will bring a lot for our image.” Puma has also acquired the rights to produce other branded Arsenal merchandise that will be sold to fans around the world. Financial details were not disclosed but Puma said the deal was the biggest ever for both itself and Arsenal. In 2012, Arsenal signed a contract renewal with airlines Emirates for shirt and stadium sponsorship worth 150 million pounds over five years. Arsenal CEO Ivan Gazidis said the club had held talks with several sportswear companies before choosing Puma. “They are a substantial company with the kind of scale that a club like Arsenal needs as we reach out to our global fan base,” he told Reuters. Arsenal were also impressed by Puma’s focus on the club rather than juggling several big name partnerships. “We’ll be one of their primary partners,” Gazidis said. He also told the news conference that the club expected manager Arsene Wenger to stay on at the club. The Puma deal is no surprise after news of it leaked on social media late last year. However, Arsenal fans are likely to press the club to spend heavily before the player transfer window closes at the end of the month to boost the team’s push for a first trophy since 2005.

225,NKE,INTERVIEW-Puma seeks to source goods closer to Western consumers,"* Brands looking to improve speed, flexibility of sourcing * Puma will not abandon Cambodia, Bangladesh despite problems * Adidas, H&M; also looking to diversify sourcing * Technology like 3D printing may make Puma less driven by labour costs By Emma Thomasson HERZOGENAURACH, Germany, Feb 20 (Reuters) - German sportswear firm Puma SE is looking to produce more goods closer to customers in Europe and the Americas, but will not abandon Asia in the next few years despite rising labour costs and political unrest, its chief executive said. Puma, which has 178 suppliers in 32 countries, sources 79 percent of its goods from Asia, mostly from China, Vietnam, Indonesia and Cambodia - the latter where a violent crackdown on garment workers striking over pay has disrupted production at its suppliers. CEO Bjoern Gulden expressed frustration that industry lead times are so long, with ranges being designed now only going on sale in autumn 2015. Puma is looking into producing more goods closer to consumers to be more responsive to demand, including in Turkey and eastern Europe, and in Mexico to serve the Americas, he said, without giving further details. Over 70 percent of the firm’s sales were in Europe and the Americas last year. But the chief executive said his first priority was to revamp Puma’s products before overhauling its supply chain. “Everybody is looking at how to improve the speed and flexibility of sourcing but for the next three to four years the majority will come out of Asia because of the infrastructure,” Gulden told Reuters on Thursday after Puma’s annual news conference. “Yes, there are issues in Cambodia and Bangladesh but to run away from it and pull out of the country cannot be the answer,” he said. “You can’t say this is a very poor country and so we shouldn’t go there. It’s the opposite.” Rising labour costs in China in recent years have prompted brand to seeks lower-cost markets in Asia such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Cambodia, countries where demands are now mounting for better pay. A factory collapse in Bangladesh last year that killed more than 1,100 people has put pressure on big brands to improve working conditions for those making products for the West. Election-related violence there earlier this year also disrupted the garment sector. Puma, which ranks a distant third in the sports apparel industry in terms of sales behind Nike Inc and Adidas AG , reported that sales slumped in the last quarter of 2014. Adidas has set up a “Speedfactory” team to look into setting up mini plants closer to consumers, the Handelsblatt daily reported on Thursday. Hennes & Mauritz, the world’s second biggest fashion chain which sources most of its clothes from Asia, said last month it is considering producing more goods in Africa. Gulden, a 48-year-old who joined Puma last July from Danish jewellery company Pandora, started his career at Adidas, working in apparel design and sourcing, spending months visiting factories in Asia. “The factories we work in are clean, nice. They cannot be compared to what we saw in Asia 20 years ago,” he said. “In this industry we all go to the same places because we are dependent on the infrastructure ... We all have the same interests. We don’t want to be dependent on one or two countries.” Rather than shifting production to Africa to take advantage of lower labour costs, Gulden expects the future to be driven by innovative technology such as 3D printing, which the company is already using for prototype shoes. “Technology is changing so we are more independent of labour,” he said, adding that many of the latest soccer boots no longer need stitching.

226,NKE,Puma hopes top signings will stop sales slump in 2014,"HERZOGENAURACH, Germany (Reuters) - German sportswear company Puma SE (PUMG.DE) is banking on high-profile signings to underline its sporting credentials and stop sales falling this year, after revenue tumbled more than expected in the last three months of 2013. Puma ranks a distant third in the sports apparel industry by sales behind Nike Inc (NKE.N) and Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE) and new CEO Bjoern Gulden is trying to return the company to its sporting roots under a turnaround plan that breaks with former chief Jochen Zeitz’s focus on sports-inspired fashion. Gulden, a Norwegian former professional soccer player who took the helm last July, said the signing of deals with English soccer club Arsenal, Italian footballer Mario Balotelli and the extension of its sponsorship of Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt showed Puma was a “true sports brand.” However Puma shares were down 3.4 percent at 201.00 euros by 5.35 a.m. ET, having fallen to a near 2-1/2 year low of 199.2 euros, after the group said it expects flat net sales in 2014, with a rise in the second half to compensate for a first-half fall. Puma, which last month ousted Nike as kit supplier to Arsenal from next season, is due later this year to launch a brand campaign dubbed “Forever Faster”. Gulden said another deal with a big soccer club could come although there was nothing imminent. English premiership champions Manchester United Plc (MANU.N) are talking to several firms about a new kit supply deal to replace one with Nike that expires next year. Puma, 84 percent owned by French luxury group Kering SA (PRTP.PA), said sales fell 13.2 percent to 698.3 million euros ($960 million) in the last quarter, missing an average forecast of 718 million as footwear sales shrank 21 percent. Kering shares slipped 0.5 percent. Gulden started his presentation of Puma’s annual results by showing the latest medals table from the Winter Olympics - with his home country Norway topping the list. “Puma numbers were not number one,” he lamented. “Obviously these numbers are not our end game and we are not happy with that ... 2014 marks the start of the turnaround.” The soccer World Cup and the Winter Olympics in Sochi should help sportswear sales to grow between 3.5 percent and 4 percent this year, the World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry (WFSGI) predicted last month. Puma noted that a quarter of all teams at the World Cup would be wearing its kit, including Italy, Switzerland and four teams from Africa, seen as a big future growth market. Unlike many other brands, which launched their World Cup replica kits before Christmas, Puma shirts go on sale next month. Gulden said his top priority is to fix the group’s footwear sales, which account for almost half of sales and which fell a currency-adjusted 8.6 percent in 2013, compared with a dip of 1.2 percent for apparel and growth of 9.7 percent for accessories.

It expects its gross profit margin to improve slightly in 2014 due to sourcing improvements and a changing product mix. The figure fell to 43.2 percent in the quarter from 44.6 percent due to discounting and currency effects. Puma said it would pay an unchanged dividend of 0.50 euros per share.

227,NKE,UPDATE 2-Puma hopes top signings will stop sales slump in 2014,"* Q4 sales fall 13.2 pct to 698.3 mln eur vs f’cast 718 mln * Sales seen flat in 2014, helped by Arsenal deal * Other soccer club deals possible but not imminent * Gross margin seen increasing slightly from 43.2 pct in Q4 * Shares down over 3pct, hit near 2-1/2 yr low   (Adds details, shares) By Emma Thomasson HERZOGENAURACH, Germany, Feb 20 (Reuters) - German sportswear company Puma SE is banking on high-profile signings to underline its sporting credentials and stop sales falling this year, after revenue tumbled more than expected in the last three months of 2013. Puma ranks a distant third in the sports apparel industry by sales behind Nike Inc and Adidas AG and new CEO Bjoern Gulden is trying to return the company to its sporting roots under a turnaround plan that breaks with former chief Jochen Zeitz’s focus on sports-inspired fashion. Gulden, a Norwegian former professional soccer player who took the helm last July, said the signing of deals with English soccer club Arsenal, Italian footballer Mario Balotelli and the extension of its sponsorship of Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt showed Puma was a “true sports brand.” However Puma shares were down 3.4 percent at 201.00 euros by 1035 GMT, having fallen to a near 2-1/2 year low of 199.2 euros, after the group said it expects flat net sales in 2014, with a rise in the second half to compensate for a first-half fall. Puma, which last month ousted Nike as kit supplier to Arsenal from next season, is due later this year to launch a brand campaign dubbed “Forever Faster”. Gulden said another deal with a big soccer club could come although there was nothing imminent. English premiership champions Manchester United Plc are talking to several firms about a new kit supply deal to replace one with Nike that expires next year. Puma, 84 percent owned by French luxury group Kering SA , said sales fell 13.2 percent to 698.3 million euros ($960 million) in the last quarter, missing an average forecast of 718 million as footwear sales shrank 21 percent. Kering shares slipped 0.5 percent. Gulden started his presentation of Puma’s annual results by showing the latest medals table from the Winter Olympics - with his home country Norway topping the list. “Puma numbers were not number one,” he lamented.    “Obviously these numbers are not our end game and we are not happy with that ... 2014 marks the start of the turnaround.” The soccer World Cup and the Winter Olympics in Sochi should help sportswear sales to grow between 3.5 percent and 4 percent this year, the World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry (WFSGI) predicted last month. Puma noted that a quarter of all teams at the World Cup would be wearing its kit, including Italy, Switzerland and four teams from Africa, seen as a big future growth market. Unlike many other brands, which launched their World Cup replica kits before Christmas, Puma shirts go on sale next month. Gulden said his top priority is to fix the group’s footwear sales, which account for almost half of sales and which fell a currency-adjusted 8.6 percent in 2013, compared with a dip of 1.2 percent for apparel and growth of 9.7 percent for accessories.

228,NKE,Adidas and Nike battle for soccer supremacy in World Cup year,"* Adidas and Nike step up marketing campaigns ahead of World Cup * Two companies dominate $5 billion plus soccer kit market * “Knitted” boots, lightweight shirts to tempt fans By Keith Weir and Emma Thomasson LONDON/BERLIN, March 10 (Reuters) - With the soccer World Cup only three months away, Adidas and Nike  are squaring up for a marketing battle to match the fierce on-field rivalry of nations like Brazil and Argentina. The sportswear giants dominate a soccer kit industry worth more than $5 billion annually. They vie for the title of market leader in the supply of hi-tech boots and jerseys to fans inspired by Argentine Lionel Messi, who wears Adidas, or new Brazilian idol Neymar, who is in the Nike camp. A bootmaker since the 1950s and a World Cup sponsor, Germany’s Adidas regards soccer as its territory and wants to avoid being overtaken by younger but larger American rival Nike, as has happened in other sports. “Forget all you may have heard or written about a weak Adidas performance in football in 2013. We are leading this category that is so close to the Adidas DNA,” Chief Executive Herbert Hainer said last week. “2014 is a football year and it will be an Adidas football year,” he added, targeting record annual soccer-related sales of 2 billion euros ($2.8 billion). However, Hainer conceded that competition is fierce, with the top two brands sharing upwards of 80 percent of the market for many soccer products. Nike has built its business swiftly, having got heavily involved in soccer only 20 years ago when the World Cup was played in the United States. It generates revenues of $2 billion from the sport and calls itself the leading soccer brand. It will provide kit for hosts Brazil and a total of 10 of the 32 finalists this year - outscoring Adidas and Puma  in that regard. Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards said sales should get an extra boost from the fact the World Cup is in Brazil, the spiritual home of stylish soccer. “We couldn’t be more excited about the World Cup being in Brazil. It will resonate around the world,” he told Reuters. Held every four years, the World Cup is a showcase for innovation in design of boots which the manufacturers claims will give players the edge in the big matches and hopefully go on to be big sellers throughout the rest of the year. “With replica kits, you will suddenly see an uptick in terms of sales during a tournament but with boots it’s more continual,” said Nike’s Edwards. Nike last week launched its new Magista boot, based on the company’s Flyknit technology in which the upper is made from knitted synthetic strands of material. The technology has been used for Nike’s running and basketball shoes and the aim is to create a lightweight product which is also durable. Spanish international Andres Iniesta and German Mario Goetze were involved in developing the boot and Edwards said players wanted a “barefoot with studs” feel. Park players who want to emulate their World Cup heroes will have to dig deep into their wallets as the boot will cost $275. There are only so many ways a soccer boot can be remade and new products from Adidas and Puma draw on technologies and ideas that don’t appear to differ radically from what Nike is doing. Adidas has already launched colourful “Samba” versions of its four main boots and will present its first “knitted” boot in mid-March. Hainer said the technology had the potential to revolutionise how and where Adidas produces shoes. Puma, based in the same small southern German town as Adidas, wants the World Cup to underline a shift back to performance sports and away from fashion. To that end, it has already launched a snug-fitting bright orange “evoPOWER” boot with yellow laces offset to one side. “It inspired by barefoot beach soccer in Brazil,” Torsten Hochstetter, Puma global creative director, told Reuters. Technology is also being used in shirt design. Adidas says its World Cup shirts are 50 percent lighter than previous ones. Eight teams will wear Adidas at the tournament in June, including world champions Spain, Germany and Argentina. Puma launched shirts last week for the eight sides it is outfitting at the World Cup, including Italy, Switzerland and four teams from Africa. The tight-fitting jerseys feature built-in tapes designed to stimulate players’ muscles. “This is based on taping used by physios to provide compression and stimulation,” Hochstetter said. Just like team coaches, the big brands are deploying a variety of tactics to try to gain an advantage. Nike used a Brazil friendly match against South Africa last week to model two kits, playing in the traditional yellow in the first half before switching to a new blue outfit for the second half. Adidas has stressed the importance of social media to its marketing campaigns. In a sign of the times, its Brazuca official World Cup match ball has its own Twitter account offering its thoughts in English and Portuguese. Unlikely as it sounds, the ball already has over 100,000 followers.

229,NKE,China sportswear makers talk up recovery from Beijing Olympics binge,"* ANTA records third straight quarter of order growth * Xtep, Peak Sport see improved order figures * Nike distributor Belle books rising growth in same-store sales * 361 Degrees, Li Ning to announce earnings this week HONG KONG, March 17 (Reuters) - China’s sportswear makers appear to be emerging from years of overzealous expansion fuelled by Beijing Olympic Games fever, after the country’s biggest player demonstrated sustained recovery with its third straight quarter of order growth. ANTA Sports Products Ltd and smaller rivals such as Xtep International Holdings Ltd and Peak Sport Products Co Ltd were caught out after the 2008 games when demand fell far short of expectations. Massive inventories and the cost of maintaining a sprawling outlet network outlet soon ate into margins. Foreign competitors including Nike Inc and adidas AG  also took a knock from an ensuing war of price discounts, in a market widely regarded as a growth engine while demand is sluggish in Europe and the United States. Sportswear makers have since been clearing stocks and closing stores. ANTA - the biggest by market value at $4 billion - finally offered a sign of industry recovery last month by booking a high single-digit percentage growth in orders for third-quarter delivery. “The sportswear sector is back on a growth track and ANTA is the leader of the trend. Positive order growth for ANTA will likely be sustained in the next few years,” said Hong Kong-based UBS analyst Spencer Leung. At Xtep, third-quarter orders fell on year by a low single-digit percent, but the rate of decline has narrowed over the past year. Peak even booked percentage growth in the mid-teens, saying orders for delivery in the first to third quarters pointed to overall recovery. “After this round of industry consolidation (reorganisation) overall industry operating conditions shall gradually improve,” Xtep Chairman Ding Shui Po said in an earnings statement last week. Peak Chairman Xu Jingnan concurred. “Consolidation of the sportswear industry is near the end, since a considerable number of small sportswear companies have already exited the market.” China’s biggest distributor Belle International Holdings , which sells sportswear from Nike, adidas and Puma SE , offered further indication of the industry gradually getting back on its feet. On Tuesday, Belle said same-store sportswear sales grew 7.0 percent for the three months to February compared with the same period a year earlier. That was an improvement from the 5.0 percent of October-December and 4.5 percent of July-September. ANTA, which kitted out China’s delegation to the Sochi Winter Olympic Games last month, plans to open more stores in prime locations, in contrast to its pre-Beijing Olympics strategy of opening stores in even far-flung locations. The company posted net profit of 1.31 billion yuan ($213.49 million) last year, a 3.2 percent on-year decline, though much narrower than the previous year’s 21.5 percent drop. It said average inventory days, or the time taken to sell goods produced, was 59 last year from 51 in 2012 and 44.1 in the Olympic year. The higher the number, the lower the cost of sales. In mid-2012, the figure spiked to 102.5. But ANTA’s most significant indicator of recovery is last month’s quarterly trade fair orders. “People will pay attention to other players for signs of a similar phenomenon as at ANTA, which saw growth in orders,” said Sunwah Kingsway Group Research analyst Steve Chow. Sportswear maker 361 Degrees International Ltd is scheduled to report earnings on March 17, and Li Ning Co Ltd  is due to report on March 21.

230,NKE,"As giant U.S. IPO nears, Alibaba's China e-commerce crown slips","* Share of China online retail fell for first time in 2013 * IPO in U.S. could exceed Facebook’s $16 bln in value * Tencent, JD.com tie-up sharpens e-commerce challenge * Niche players, retail brands also step up competition By Adam Jourdan SHANGHAI, March 17 (Reuters) - Alibaba’s dominance of online retail in China faces its biggest-ever challenge as the firm founded by Jack Ma in a one-room apartment 15 years ago lines up a U.S. initial public offering that could value the firm at around $140 billion. In a rare blip, Alibaba Group Holdings lost market share last year while its nearest rivals all grew, according to Euromonitor. The market research firm sees China’s internet retail market tripling from 2012 to over $300 billion in 2018 as the country’s smartphone-savvy shoppers buy everything from plane tickets to sneakers online. China’s biggest social media company, Tencent Holdings Ltd , is leading the revolt, linking the country’s most popular messaging app, WeChat, with the number two e-commerce player, JD.com. An array of smaller rivals is also clawing away at Alibaba’s lead, while household retail names like Nike Inc and Gap Inc are increasingly striking out away from the giant’s Tmall electronic platform to set up more distinctive online stores of their own. “In China shopping is a social activity. You want to tell friends about it, recommend it - it’s a smartphone activity, and whoever owns that organisational ability also has a hold over how a person shops,” said Frank Lavin, Hong Kong-based chief executive of Export Now. Lavin’s company helps global firms set up shop in China through Alibaba’s Tmall. Alibaba’s e-commerce prospects at home loom large after Ma’s firm said on Sunday it was starting plans for a long-awaited listing in the U.S. - potentially the biggest-ever IPO by an Internet company - which could surpass the $16 billion raised by social media giant Facebook Inc in 2012. Alibaba still held a sturdy 45.1 percent of China’s e-commerce market last year, down from 46.1 percent a year earlier, according to Euromonitor, and remains bullish in the face of Tencent, JD.com and others. It is beefing up its mobile services to keep up with China’s legions of smartphone users. Alibaba did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story, though the firm’s executive vice chairman Joe Tsai was upbeat about the firm’s e-commerce prospects in an interview with Reuters in Hong Kong last week. Alibaba is now battling rivals on multiple fronts. Alongside JD.com, heading for a $1.5 billion IPO of its own in the U.S., are well-funded vehicles like household appliance retailer Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd and Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s grocery retailer Yihaodian. Smaller niche players like cosmetics specialist Vipshop Holdings Ltd are also growing in stature. And with global and local brands peeling away from Tmall, the trend is likely to see Alibaba’s market share extend its fall, said Bryan Wang, Beijing-based vice president for Forrester Research. “We have definitely seen a lot more customers asking us in the last year about how to get away from Tmall,” said Wang. Popular Internet clothing retailer HSTYLE has partly flown the nest. Competing with brands like H&M; and Uniqlo, it has branched out from just having a Tmall outlet and now books half its sales through its own site and on JD.com and Tencent. “As a mature Internet brand we’re looking to provide more individual service to our shoppers,” Zhao Yingguang, founder and chairman of HSTYLE, told Reuters in an interview, describing his brand as one of the leading women’s apparel retailers on Alibaba’s platforms. “We go and sell our products where the consumers are.” Alibaba’s vast resources have helped it see off weaker players so far such as Otto Group, 139shop.com, Mecox Lane, Newegg.com and others, but the remaining contenders are more seasoned in competition with Alibaba - and ambitious. JD.com still lags some way behind Alibaba in second place with a 14 percent market share last year, up fractionally from a year earlier. But its IPO plans and the deal with Tencent - a less well-known name outside China than Alibaba, but worth almost $150 billion by market value - will give it new financial and operational resources. Tencent, meanwhile, hopes its JD.com tie-up will help it to extend its presence in “the fast-growing physical goods e-commerce market”, Tencent president Martin Lau said in a statement. The deal also arms JD.com with the 225 million monthly active users of the WeChat messaging service in China. As well as technology leading change, consumers themselves are developing new habits, becoming more picky and looking to get more for their money. “I am leaning toward specialist stores now, because the service is often better than the giant retailers and the delivery I always find is faster,” said Grace Lin, 20, a student in Shanghai. “It’s not necessarily that I use Tmall less now, but I do use other stores more.” Lin often shops on cosmetics specialist Vipshop’s online site. The firm saw revenue climb 145 percent in 2013, while customer numbers shot up 130 percent over the same period, according to an earnings conference call this month. Vipshop almost doubled its market share to 1.8 percent last year. Suning, a traditional electronics retailer with a strong bricks and mortar presence, is bulking up its online presence, as is rival Bain Capital-backed Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd. Both raised their market share last year. Yihaodian leverages majority owner Wal-Mart’s global name and product range, while other niche players such as Jumei and Yesmywine.com corner specific markets in cosmetics and alcohol. Alibaba’s Jack Ma has locked horns repeatedly of late with his rival at Tencent, co-founder Pony Ma - a namesake but unrelated. Rhetoric from the two internet giants has grown increasingly barbed as competition has raged from gaming and microblogs, to taxi hire app price wars and online payment systems that are now the subject of close scrutiny by China’s central bank. When Tencent launched a “red envelope” feature for WeChat, which let users send money gifts by smartphone over the Chinese New Year, Jack Ma wrote it was a “Pearl Harbour attack” on his company’s Alipay payment system, referring to the unexpected bombing of the American port during World War II. Tencent said over 8 million people used the WeChat feature. Alibaba-invested Weibo Corp, a popular Twitter-like social media platform, filed for a $500 million U.S. IPO of its own on Friday, as it looks to defend its position against fierce competition from Tencent’s WeChat. WeChat does indeed present a threat to Alibaba. In a research report in December, Standard Chartered said its payment function, known in Chinese as Weixin, paired with its wide popularity, could be a “killer weapon” for Tencent to take market share in mobile e-commerce. China has some of the most active mobile web users in the world. The country’s mobile Internet users hit 500 million in 2013, and is estimated to hit 750 million by 2017, according to data from China-based consultancy iResearch. “The wind is blowing against Alibaba and the biggest risk is coming from the mobile sector,” said Zhang Chenhao, executive director at e-commmerce-focused investment advisory firm Gold Sand Capital. “Firms are all lining up - the school of Tencent or the school of Alibaba - and the camps are forming,” said Zhang.

The chairmen of both Xtep and Peak expressed similar turnaround sentiment, though both saw net profit fall 20 percent last year as a result of operational reorganisation. At 361 Degrees, the profit decline was 70 percent “Even though we see the inventory issue has been taken care of, the industry is still not yet in a stage that we see solid organic growth. It may take a while,” said Linus Yip, chief strategist at Hong Kong-based First Shanghai Securities. Shares of 361 Degrees closed down 1 percent on Monday after the company announced earnings which missed analyst estimates.

233,NKE,"As giant U.S. IPO nears, Alibaba's China e-commerce crown slips","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Alibaba’s dominance of online retail in China faces its biggest-ever challenge as the firm founded by Jack Ma in a one-room apartment 15 years ago lines up a U.S. initial public offering that could value the firm at around $140 billion. In a rare blip, Alibaba Group Holdings lost market share last year while its nearest rivals all grew, according to Euromonitor. The market research firm sees China’s internet retail market tripling from 2012 to over $300 billion in 2018 as the country’s smartphone-savvy shoppers buy everything from plane tickets to sneakers online. China’s biggest social media company, Tencent Holdings Ltd, is leading the revolt, linking the country’s most popular messaging app, WeChat, with the number two e-commerce player, JD.com. An array of smaller rivals is also clawing away at Alibaba’s lead, while household retail names like Nike Inc and Gap Inc are increasingly striking out away from the giant’s Tmall electronic platform to set up more distinctive online stores of their own. “In China shopping is a social activity. You want to tell friends about it, recommend it - it’s a smartphone activity, and whoever owns that organisational ability also has a hold over how a person shops,” said Frank Lavin, Hong Kong-based chief executive of Export Now. Lavin’s company helps global firms set up shop in China through Alibaba’s Tmall. Alibaba’s e-commerce prospects at home loom large after Ma’s firm said on Sunday it was starting plans for a long-awaited listing in the U.S. - potentially the biggest-ever IPO by an Internet company - which could surpass the $16 billion raised by social media giant Facebook Inc in 2012. Alibaba still held a sturdy 45.1 percent of China’s e-commerce market last year, down from 46.1 percent a year earlier, according to Euromonitor, and remains bullish in the face of Tencent, JD.com and others. It is beefing up its mobile services to keep up with China’s legions of smartphone users. Alibaba did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story, though the firm’s executive vice chairman Joe Tsai was upbeat about the firm’s e-commerce prospects in an interview with Reuters in Hong Kong last week. Alibaba is now battling rivals on multiple fronts. Alongside JD.com, heading for a $1.5 billion IPO of its own in the U.S., are well-funded vehicles like household appliance retailer Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd and Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s grocery retailer Yihaodian. Smaller niche players like cosmetics specialist Vipshop Holdings Ltd are also growing in stature. And with global and local brands peeling away from Tmall, the trend is likely to see Alibaba’s market share extend its fall, said Bryan Wang, Beijing-based vice president for Forrester Research. “We have definitely seen a lot more customers asking us in the last year about how to get away from Tmall,” said Wang. Popular Internet clothing retailer HSTYLE has partly flown the nest. Competing with brands like H&M; and Uniqlo, it has branched out from just having a Tmall outlet and now books half its sales through its own site and on JD.com and Tencent. “As a mature Internet brand we’re looking to provide more individual service to our shoppers,” Zhao Yingguang, founder and chairman of HSTYLE, told Reuters in an interview, describing his brand as one of the leading women’s apparel retailers on Alibaba’s platforms. “We go and sell our products where the consumers are.” Alibaba’s vast resources have helped it see off weaker players so far such as Otto Group, 139shop.com, Mecox Lane, Newegg.com and others, but the remaining contenders are more seasoned in competition with Alibaba - and ambitious. JD.com still lags some way behind Alibaba in second place with a 14 percent market share last year, up fractionally from a year earlier. But its IPO plans and the deal with Tencent - a less well-known name outside China than Alibaba, but worth almost $150 billion by market value - will give it new financial and operational resources. Tencent, meanwhile, hopes its JD.com tie-up will help it to extend its presence in “the fast-growing physical goods e-commerce market”, Tencent president Martin Lau said in a statement. The deal also arms JD.com with the 225 million monthly active users of the WeChat messaging service in China. As well as technology leading change, consumers themselves are developing new habits, becoming more picky and looking to get more for their money. “I am leaning toward specialist stores now, because the service is often better than the giant retailers and the delivery I always find is faster,” said Grace Lin, 20, a student in Shanghai. “It’s not necessarily that I use Tmall less now, but I do use other stores more.” Lin often shops on cosmetics specialist Vipshop’s online site. The firm saw revenue climb 145 percent in 2013, while customer numbers shot up 130 percent over the same period, according to an earnings conference call this month. Vipshop almost doubled its market share to 1.8 percent last year. Suning, a traditional electronics retailer with a strong bricks and mortar presence, is bulking up its online presence, as is rival Bain Capital-backed Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd. Both raised their market share last year. Yihaodian leverages majority owner Wal-Mart’s global name and product range, while other niche players such as Jumei and Yesmywine.com corner specific markets in cosmetics and alcohol. Alibaba’s Jack Ma has locked horns repeatedly of late with his rival at Tencent, co-founder Pony Ma - a namesake but unrelated. Rhetoric from the two internet giants has grown increasingly barbed as competition has raged from gaming and microblogs, to taxi hire app price wars and online payment systems that are now the subject of close scrutiny by China’s central bank. When Tencent launched a “red envelope” feature for WeChat, which let users send money gifts by smartphone over the Chinese New Year, Jack Ma wrote it was a “Pearl Harbour attack” on his company’s Alipay payment system, referring to the unexpected bombing of the American port during World War II. Tencent said over 8 million people used the WeChat feature. Alibaba-invested Weibo Corp, a popular Twitter-like social media platform, filed for a $500 million U.S. IPO of its own on Friday, as it looks to defend its position against fierce competition from Tencent’s WeChat. WeChat does indeed present a threat to Alibaba. In a research report in December, Standard Chartered said its payment function, known in Chinese as Weixin, paired with its wide popularity, could be a “killer weapon” for Tencent to take market share in mobile e-commerce. China has some of the most active mobile web users in the world. The country’s mobile Internet users hit 500 million in 2013, and is estimated to hit 750 million by 2017, according to data from China-based consultancy iResearch. “The wind is blowing against Alibaba and the biggest risk is coming from the mobile sector,” said Zhang Chenhao, executive director at e-commmerce-focused investment advisory firm Gold Sand Capital. “Firms are all lining up - the school of Tencent or the school of Alibaba - and the camps are forming,” said Zhang.

234,NKE,"Nike warns FX fluctuations to slam profit, expects weak China sales","(Reuters) - Nike Inc (NKE.N) on Thursday warned Wall Street that growing pressures from weaker currencies in key emerging markets would take a big toll on its profit in the current quarter and into the next fiscal year. The maker of sports shoes and apparel also said sales in China would be unchanged or even down slightly this quarter, reawakening concerns it is having trouble finding its bearings in that market after signs of progress in recent quarters. Nike shares fell 3 percent to $76.88 in after-hours trading. Chief Financial Officer Donald Blair told analysts on a call that the devaluation of developing market currencies against the U.S. dollar “will be a significant drag on next year’s reported revenue, gross margin and profit growth.” Blair said Nike now expects earnings per share in the fiscal year beginning in June that will be “somewhat” below the company’s mid-teens-percentage target. Nike gets about 30 percent of its revenue from emerging markets, China and Eastern and Central Europe. Still, the fundamentals of Nike’s business were solid, with strong demand for its merchandise heading into the World Cup soccer tournament in June and July. Orders for Nike-branded shoes and clothing scheduled for delivery between March and July 2014, a gauge of demand Nike calls “futures orders,” rose 14 percent globally, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, led by a 30 percent jump in Western Europe. The company also reported a better than expected profit for the third quarter ended February 28, helped by a large jump in revenue in Western Europe, where it competes with Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE). Nike has been spending heavily on marketing ahead of the World Cup, which Brazil will host this summer. Total revenue rose 12.7 percent to $6.97 billion for the quarter ended February 28, above the $6.69 billion analysts were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In China, where Nike has grappled with the lingering effects of excess inventory and intense competition from rivals cutting prices in recent years, sales rose 7 percent. “They continue to produce items that resonate with shoppers globally,” said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough. “They’re gaining share in each of their markets.” Still, the poor forecasts for China were worrisome, Yarbrough said. Nike earned $685 million, or 76 cents a share, in its fiscal third quarter ended February 28, compared to $866 million, or 73 cents per share a year earlier. Excluding discontinued operations, Nike had a profit of 76 cents per share for the quarter, four cents better than Wall Street had expected.

The S&P; 500 lost momentum after hitting an all-time intraday high of 1,883.97, with biotechs among the primary decliners. Biogen Idec Inc, down 8.2 percent at $318.53, and Gilead Sciences Inc, down 4.6 percent at $72.07, were the two biggest drags on the S&P; 500. The Nasdaq biotech index  fell 4.4 percent. U.S. lawmakers have asked Gilead to explain the $84,000 price tag of its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which is encountering resistance from health insurers and state Medicaid programs. “They’ve been selling them - the techs in particular, as well as the biotechs, even more particular there.

244,NKE,Adidas gives digital makeover to Originals fashion stores,"* Targets 9 percent more stores in 2014 * Growing retail business helps keep margins above Nike * Young shoppers look for social, digital experience * Sports-inspired fashion is increasingly competitive By Emma Thomasson BERLIN, March 27 (Reuters) - Adidas has launched a new store blueprint for its Originals fashion brand with a Wi-Fi equipped lounge and mobile charging points, aiming to persuade younger shoppers to linger longer and spend more in its high-margin, own-run outlets. The world’s No.2 sportswear maker behind Nike wants to lift sales from its own shops, which accounted for 24 percent of its 2013 revenue of 14.5 billion euros ($20 billion), because they are more profitable than those made through third parties. The revamped Originals store in the heart of Berlin is part of a drive to encourage 16-24 year-olds to browse longer. “Shopping for this generation is very social. They need to have a place to hang out. The longer the consumer stays in the store, the more likely they are to buy,” Ted Mager, Adidas global head of retail environments, told Reuters. The shift from wholesale to retail helped boost the German firm’s gross margin by 1.5 percentage points to 49.3 percent in 2013 compared with 43.6 percent for Nike, which makes less than a fifth of sales from its own stores and online. Adidas plans to open a net 250 stores in 2014, primarily in eastern Europe, even though its already high exposure to Russia - where it operates over 1,000 stores - has hurt its share price in recent weeks due to the Ukraine crisis. It added a net 294 stores in 2013 to bring the total to 2,740, including about 250 stores under the Originals brand, but not counting some 7,500 Adidas franchises operated in China. DESIGNER HIGH-HEEL SNEAKERS In addition to a Wi-Fi lounge near the fitting rooms and a “digital bar” for charging devices, the revamped store seeks to reflect the Berlin urban vibe by stripping back decor to raw concrete and brick and exposing lighting, while underwear is displayed in an eye-catching vending machine. The new Berlin format gives more prominence to footwear, including high-heel sneakers designed by Moschino creative director Jeremy Scott and multicolour variants of the recently-relaunched classic white-and-green “Stan Smith” tennis shoes. Previously a male-oriented brand, the store seeks to more clearly showcase women’s wear as well as collaborations with partners such as fashion chain Top Shop and colourful Brazilian brand The Farm, timed for the soccer World Cup starting in June. Adidas plans to roll out the concept to Originals stores in over 30 cities, with London and Shanghai next for the makeover. It also has big ambitions for its new teen fashion brand NEO, which is being extended to Poland and the Czech Republic. However, sports-inspired fashion is becoming increasingly competitive with big players such as Sweden’s Hennes & Mauritz , Japan’s Uniqlo and Gap all offering more sportswear in recent years. And Adidas, which has been losing market share in Europe to Nike, must make sure the push into fashion does not distract from a core focus on sports performance, a mistake that cost German rival Puma dear. To that end, it is also revamping its flagship sportswear stores, seeking to create a stadium-like experience and, like the new Originals store, putting a focus on footwear and creating a multi-media experience for shoppers. “Footwear is treated as the centre of the brand and the heart of the experience,” Mager said. “The consumer can buy everything, anywhere online. We need to give them a compelling reason to come into the store.” ",3272014,http://www.reuters.com/article/adidas-retail/adidas-gives-digital-makeover-to-originals-fashion-stores-idUSL6N0MH2TE20140327
245,NKE,Soccer-Fans cry foul over $150 England World Cup shirt,"(Repeats to additional subsribers, no changes to text) By Keith Weir LONDON, April 1 (Reuters) - Sportwear company Nike came under fire on Tuesday after England World Cup shirts went on sale for a price of up to 90 pounds ($150) ahead of this year’s tournament in Brazil. The U.S. company said the top price was for a limited edition shirt which was an exact copy in terms of material, fit and finish of what the England players will wear. A more basic replica shirt costs 60 pounds. British newspapers branded the shirts a “rip-off” but Nike’s German rivals Adidas and Puma are charging similar prices for the shirts of major countries they are supplying at the World Cup. Fans in London said they would be reluctant to pay so much for an England shirt. “An ideal price would be 30 to 40 pounds, which is acceptable,” said Greg Brown, 35. “I tend to buy football shirts at the end of the season at half price to save money.” The England shirt is usually a big seller with fans who take pride in wearing the national team jersey during major tournaments and the pricing added to broader concerns that supporters are being exploited for their loyalty. “The anger generated by the 90 pound price tag for an adult England shirt is symptomatic of a wider issue of the games traditional fan base being edged out by the growing costs of being a supporter,” said opposition Labour party sports spokesman Clive Efford. The Football Association said the Nike deal helped to fund the game in England at all levels. “The FA is a not-for-profit organisation that puts 100 million pounds back into the game every year. It is through relationships with partners such as Nike that we are able to maintain that level of investment in football,” it said. Adidas and U.S. rival Nike are battling for supremacy in a soccer kit industry worth more than $5 billion annually. Puma is the third-ranked player. Nike is supplying 10 of the 32 finalists including hosts Brazil, France and the Netherlands. Adidas has nine teams and Puma is kitting out eight.

A simpler version costs half that price. Italy play England in the jungle city of Manaus on June 14 where heat and humidity are expected to play a part in deciding the contest. Adidas is selling replica shirts for countries including Germany, Argentina and Spain for 60 pounds but the price rises to 80 pounds for the top of the range German jersey. Mark Perryman, a member of the England Supporters Club, said sales would ultimately be dictated by results on the field. “The shirt will fly off the shelves if England beat Italy,” said Perryman, adding that it would be discounted rapidly if England struggled to make an impact in Brazil.

246,NKE,UPDATE 1-Soccer-UK minister wants Nike to cut price of $150 England shirt,"(Adds response from Nike) By Keith Weir LONDON, April 2 (Reuters) - Britain’s sports minister urged Nike on Wednesday to cut the cost of England World Cup shirts after a price tag of up to 90 pounds ($150) prompted a backlash from supporters but her plea went unheeded. U.S. sportswear company Nike responded by saying that the vast majority of its shirts would be on sale for 60 pounds. It stressed that the top price which has generated so many negative headlines applied only to a limited edition of the jersey. “I understand fans’ fury. It can’t be right to ask them to fork out 90 pounds for a shirt, particularly when new England kits seem to be launched so often,” sports minister Helen Grant said in a statement. “Loyal supporters are the bedrock of our national game and that must not be forgotten. Surely this pricing needs a rethink,” she added. The launch of Nike’s new England kit has been branded a “rip off” by British media and fed into a debate about whether soccer fans are being fleeced for their loyalty to club and country. “Nike would like to emphasize that the England replica shirt has always been available to fans at 60 pounds RRP (recommended retail price),” Nike said in a statement. “There is also a limited number of the shirts at 90 pounds  RRP which represents less than 1 percent of the stock available at retail,” it added. The more expensive shirt is an exact copy of what the England players will wear in Brazil in terms of material, fit and finish. The cheaper shirt is a simpler replica aimed at the mass market. Leading British sports retailer Sports Direct is offering the cheaper version online for a discounted price of 47.99 pounds, sacrificing part of its profit margin in an attempt to boost sales. Although attention in Britain is focused on Nike, its  German rivals Adidas and Puma are charging fans similar prices for national team shirts they are supplying at the World Cup.

250,NKE,Chinese shoe maker Yue Yuen in talks to resolve worker dispute,"HONG KONG, April 8 (Reuters) - Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd, which makes shoes for global brands including Nike Inc and adidas AG, said on Tuesday it is in talks to resolve a dispute over employee terms and benefits at a factory in southern China. The demonstration, which began on Saturday, is the latest to highlight a growing trend of industrial activism in China amid a worsening shortage of workers that has shifted the balance of power in labour relations. About 600 workers took to the street in the southern Chinese manufacturing hub of Dongguan due to a “misunderstanding” over social security benefits and different terms for local and migrant workers, a spokesman for Yue Yuen, the world’s largest maker of athletic shoes, told Reuters. “The misunderstanding has to be clarified by the government, in particular any difference between local and migrant workers when they claim their benefits,” the spokesman said. Yue Yuen, which employs about 60,000 workers in the district, was in talks with local government officials and labour union representatives and hoped to resolve the issue by April 14, the spokesman said. Adidas said in a statement it was closely monitoring the situation and confirmed its supplier was in talks with local authorities to address workers’ concerns. Nike did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last month, a strike at a factory of International Business Machines Corp in the southern boom town of Shenzhen illustrated how significant changes in China’s labour market are emboldening workers to take matters into their own hands, raising risks for multinationals, labour experts say. In November, hundreds of employees stopped work at a Nokia Oyj factory in Dongguan, complaining of changes following Nokia’s sale of its mobile phone business to Microsoft Corp. Yuen Yuen, which listed in Hong Kong in 1992 and has a market value of $5.4 billion, said its business in Dongguan was operating as normal. Shares of the company closed down 0.4 percent in Hong Kong on Tuesday, lagging a 1 percent gain for the benchmark Hang Seng Index. Yue Yuen, which also makes shoes for brands Reebok, ASICS, New Balance, Puma, Converse, Salomon and Timberland, has factories in China, Indonesia, Vietnam, the United States, Mexico and elsewhere in Asia.

251,NKE,Soccer-Atletico success built on shaky economic foundations,"MADRID, April 8 (Reuters) - Atletico Madrid’s emergence as a third force in Spain and contenders among Europe’s elite rests on wobbly economic foundations and the edifice could come crashing down if they cannot sustain their remarkable run. The club’s success is in large measure down to inspirational coach Diego Simeone, who since taking charge in late 2011 has moulded an unspectacular squad into a unit capable of challenging the continent’s richest clubs, including La Liga rivals Real Madrid and Barcelona. Real and Barca again topped Deloitte’s latest Football Money League of the world’s wealthiest club’s by income, with revenue in excess of 500 million euros ($687 million), while Atletico squeaked into the top 20 with earnings of 120 million. Despite the huge gulf in resources, they are a point clear of Barca at the top of Spain’s domestic league and three ahead of Real with six games left and are closing in on a first La Liga title since 1996 with a team featuring Simeone in midfield. At the same time, they have enjoyed another lucrative run in Europe and play their Champions League quarter-final, second leg at home to Barca on Wednesday with the pair locked at 1-1 after last week’s first leg in the Catalan capital. Step back from the euphoria for a moment, however, and a glance at Atletico’s accounts makes for grim reading. Figures for 2011-12 collated by Jose Maria Gay, a professor at the University of Barcelona and an expert on soccer finances, show the club are saddled with debts of more than 500 million euros and the cost of paying their players and staff alone is more than 90 percent of annual earnings. They had managed to stay afloat due to their unexpected winnings on the pitch and by convincing the government to let them fall behind in the payment of more than 100 million euros in taxes, according to Jaume Llopis, a professor at the IESE business school in Barcelona and soccer finance expert. The sale of top players like Fernando Torres, David De Gea and Sergio Aguero to the Premier League, a partnership with the Azerbaijan tourist board, reported to be worth 12 million euros over 18 months, and a deal with sporting goods maker Nike have also helped keep the wolves from the door, Llopis said. “Atletico Madrid’s financial situation is dramatic,” he told Reuters. “But this year because of the team’s excellent results their economic problems are not talked about. “Only with their continued presence in the Champions League, locking in the sponsorship deal with Azerbaijan, attracting more sponsors and selling their best players can they improve their finances, although it will be very tough. “Either they stay in the Champions League and win the odd title which keeps the sponsors happy or they won’t be able to straighten out their precarious economic situation.” Angel Barajas, a professor of finance and accounting at the University of Vigo who specialises in sports economics, believes Atletico do not have the resources to challenge in more than one competition over the longer term. However, by selling their best players from time to time and buying decent replacements, as well as bringing through talent from the club’s academy, they could remain a strong contender in the second rank behind the richest teams, he added. “Atletico’s situation is problematic because of the level of debt but if they manage to keep wages under control and sell players to raise cash, while keeping their sporting model intact, they could stay at a good level,” Barajas told Reuters. “What is not viable in the long term is trying to stay in the fight for La Liga and European silverware in competition with clubs who have more than twice their earnings. “One exceptional season is possible but competing at the highest level in various competitions needs not only a good team but an extraordinary squad. And that costs a great deal.” Placido Rodriguez, a professor of economics at Oviedo University and a former chairman of Sporting Gijon, noted several examples of Spanish clubs with relatively limited resources that have challenged at the highest level before fading away again. These included Valencia, Villarreal, Deportivo La Coruna and Sevilla, who all had successful runs in Europe and either won or came close to winning La Liga in the past 15 years but like Atletico, have had to sell their top performers. One potential bright spot for Atletico, which would boost revenue and help secure their future, was the planned move from their crumbling Calderon stadium to a new 70,000-capacity arena at La Peineta, Rodriguez said. There are also plans for a vast new training complex which would include offices, a 15,000-seater stadium for the second and third teams and facilities and shops for fans. “If these two projects come off and they don’t make any crazy financial decisions in the meantime, for example when results aren’t going their way, Atletico’s economic situation will be much improved,” Rodriguez told Reuters. Atletico have already qualified for next season’s Champions League and their run in the latest edition of the competition should see them climb the rankings in Deloitte’s next Money League, the accounting firm said.

The move, which is also in line with local government policies, may have a material adverse effect on its financial performance, the company said in a filing. Thousands of Yue Yuen workers have been on strike for nearly two weeks, in one of the largest strikes in China amid signs of increased labour activism as the economy slows. The factory employs some 60,000 workers. Yue Yuen said it had decided to adjust social insurance and housing subsidies that will take effect from May 1. The workers at the factory have demanded improved social insurance payments, a pay rise and more equitable contracts. Yue Yuen Chairman Lu Chin Chu added that the company will continue to review its employee benefits policy. It gave no further details. The number of strikes in China so far this year is up by close to a third - the biggest surge in protests since the global financial crisis, according to one labour group - as businesses cut costs and foreign companies restructure or close operations in response to slowing growth in the world’s second-biggest economy.

255,NKE,UPDATE 1-Adidas shifts orders from striking China plant,"(Adds comment from Nike) SHANGHAI, April 24 (Reuters) - Sportswear company Adidas AG  is shifting some orders from a factory in south China that has been at the centre of one of the country’s biggest labour strikes, underlining a rising challenge for companies operating in China, where an increasingly assertive workforce is pushing harder for its rights. Thousands of workers at a factory in Dongguan in the Pearl River Delta run by Hong Kong-listed Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings , the world’s largest shoe maker, have been on strike for more than 10 days demanding improved social insurance payments, better pay and fairer contracts. “In order to minimize the impact on our operations, we are currently reallocating some of the future orders originally allocated to Yue Yuen Dongguan to other suppliers,” a China-based Adidas spokeswoman said in emailed comments to Reuters. Adidas has no plans to sever ties with the Dongguan-based plant, and the majority of any new supply would come from within China, the spokeswoman added. “China is and will continue to be a strategic sourcing country for us.” Yue Yuen’s executive director, George Liu, declined to comment on Adidas’ decision or on whether other clients were making similar moves. The plant has around 40,000 employees and also supplies rival leisurewear brands such as Nike Inc. Yue Yuen said it made around 300 million pairs of shoes last year. “We will not make any comments in regards to our customers,” Liu said in an email sent to Reuters on Thursday. A Nike spokesman said the company has followed the events at the factory “closely” but has not shifted any production, and that Nike “has the flexibility to manage volatility.” About 20 protesters from labour rights groups in Hong Kong protested at Adidas’ local office on Thursday morning, demanding the company work with Yue Yuen to compensate employees and help release those who have been detained. The protesters also went to nearby Adidas, Nike and other stores of brands supplied by Yue Yuen to voice their demands and hand in an open letter. Earlier this week, a prominent Chinese labour activist went missing after trying to help Yue Yuen workers organize their case. His wife suspects he was detained by state security agents. China’s declining labour force has given workers greater confidence to demand their rights. The country’s working age population shrank by almost 6 million in the past two years to 920 million, National Bureau of Statistics data shows. Dozens of workers protested against Wal-Mart Stores Inc  in Hunan province after the U.S. retailer said last month it was closing a store there - a small, but important case highlighting the growing activism among Chinese workers.

Thousands of shoe factory workers staged one of China’s biggest strikes earlier this month over conditions at Hong Kong-listed Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd (0551.HK) - a $5.6 billion manufacturer of footwear for Nike Inc (NKE.N), Adidas (ADSGn.DE) and other international brands. Most of those workers have since returned to work after the company agreed to some of their demands. “We didn’t move product out in this case, but we’re staying close to it. We’ve been in a position to do that,” Parker said on the sidelines of a luncheon at the Boston College Chief Executives Club of Boston. “We’re always considering it.” He said Nike was in “close contact” with Yue Yuen and its workforce to determine if the labor conditions at the factory violate Nike’s own workplace standards, but added Nike had not yet “taken a position on that.” He said Nike had a diverse factory base in China that made it possible to shift production relatively easily. “We want to invest in the partners that are really doing the right thing with the workforce,” Parker said. “We have a factory base where we can move product around as we need to make sure that we don’t have issues with production.” Yue Yuen workers went on strike in the southern city of Dongguan on April 14 in what activists say was one of China’s biggest labor protests since market reforms began in the late 1970s. They were protesting what they said where chronically low company contributions to social insurance and housing provident fund accounts.

258,NKE,Adidas investor says loses confidence in management: report,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Adidas AG’s (ADSGn.DE) failure to narrow the market share gap with rival sportswear maker Nike Inc (NKE.N) means shareholders should refuse to back the German company’s management, a top investor was quoted as saying. Ingo Speich, a fund manager with Union Investment, told German weekly Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung the company had failed to narrow the gap with Nike and he had lost confidence in management as a result. “Even at home, in Germany as well as in Europe, Nike is gaining market share from Adidas,” Speich is reported to have told the paper, according to an advance copy of an article set to be published on Sunday. As a result, investors gathering for the company’s annual shareholder’s meeting on May 8 should refuse to grant the customary endorsement of management’s actions, said the investor whose fund is Adidas’s tenth-largest shareholder with a 0.89 percent stake. “Nike is pulling ahead of Adidas, against this background it is incomprehensible why the supervisory board extended Herbert Hainer’s contract by two years,” Speich told the paper, referring to the company’s chief executive. Adidas said in March Hainer would remain CEO until March 2017. Speich said Adidas’s targets for 2015 are unrealistic under the current management. “We no longer have confidence,” Speich is said to have told the paper. A spokesman for Adidas said Speich’s views were “one sided” and said the company had delivered record profits in 2013. No-one at Union Investment could be reached for comment. Adidas, whose shares dropped last month to their lowest in a year, had set targets for 2015 sales of 17 billion euros ($23.4 billion) and an operating margin of 11 percent - both ambitious given a target of between 8.5 and 9 percent for 2014 and 2013 sales falling 3 percent to 14.5 billion euros. The company warned in March that weakening emerging market currencies, notably the Russian rouble, would hurt 2014 results and posed a risk to its 2015 targets, even as sales are helped by the soccer World Cup. Nike, which has been encroaching on Adidas’ home territory in western Europe and challenging its dominance in the soccer market, has said it hopes to reach sales of $36 billion by 2017, up from $25.3 billion in fiscal 2013.

261,NKE,"Adidas, facing investor unrest over Nike lead, sees sales dip","BERLIN (Reuters) - German sportswear company Adidas reported disappointing first-quarter results on Tuesday due to a big drop in sales at its TaylorMade golf business, but said a stronger second quarter was signaling a return to growth. The world’s second-biggest sportswear firm, which has been losing ground in its home territory of western Europe to U.S. giant Nike, said operating profit fell almost a third to 303 million euros ($420 million), missing average analyst forecasts for 318 million. It said 80 million euros of the decline was due to a poor quarter at TaylorMade due to a change in shipping cycles and a declining U.S. golfing market, and 50 million from negative currency movements - particularly the recent drop in the Russian rouble. But Chief Executive Herbert Hainer said those factors masked strong performances in emerging markets and the company’s own retail network, which saw currency-neutral sales jump 22 percent, and confirmed the group’s guidance for a “high single-digit” increase in currency-neutral sales in 2014. “While we still have to be wary of currencies and their effects on our financials, the first quarter will be the low point of our performance. I expect a strong second quarter to point the way forward,” he told a media conference call. That may not be enough to mollify investors who have called for revolt at Thursday’s annual general meeting over Hainer’s failure to stop the advance of Nike, which extended its lead to take 15 percent of the global sportswear market in 2013 compared with 10.8 percent for Adidas, according to Euromonitor. In addition to taking on Adidas on its home turf, Nike has challenged the German firm’s dominance in the soccer market, reporting a better than expected profit for the quarter ended February 28, helped by a large jump in revenue in western Europe. Ingo Speich, a fund manager with Union Investment which has a 0.89 percent stake in Adidas and is its tenth biggest investor, said he could not understand why the board decided in March to extended the contract of Hainer - in the job since 2001 - until 2017. Adidas shares, which are already down 17 percent this year on concerns about its exposure to emerging market currencies and the Russian market, were up 0.1 percent at 6:36 am (1036 GMT), compared to a flat German blue-chip index. Hainer said he was surprised by Speich’s comments as Adidas had performed well in 2013, but said he would speak to him at Thursday’s shareholders meeting and try to regain his support. Stefan-Guenter Bauknecht, fund manager at Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management, Adidas’ sixth-biggest shareholder with a 1.45 percent stake, said he was prepared to give Hainer more time. “The low point might have been reached. It is positive that the annual targets were not scrapped today, despite the weak quarterly results,” he said. Hainer said football sales rose 27 percent in the first quarter ahead of the World Cup in Brazil starting next month, adding that sales of national shirts and the official match ball had been much higher than in the same period four years ago. Confidence for future growth was reflected in an 18 percent increase in inventories on a currency-neutral basis. However, Hainer said he was not happy with the group’s performance in North America, where currency-neutral sales fell 20 percent in the first quarter. But he expects to reverse the negative trend and grow the business for the full year. More than half of the sales decline in North America was due to TaylorMade after a change in the business model to ship more products in the last quarter of the year rather than the first three months to give them more time to sell. That was compounded by a very cold start to 2014 on the U.S. East Coast. Hainer said Adidas was holding onto its position as the market leader even though the number of rounds of golf played in the United States - the world’s biggest golfing market - fell 5 percent in the first quarter. California-based TaylorMade, a brand Adidas bought in 1997 to help it compete with Nike, is the biggest maker of golf bags, clubs, clothing and shoes in the world, with sales of 1.3 billion in 2013 or almost 9 percent of the group total. Meanwhile, Adidas is considering offers for its Rockport shoe brand, which saw sales rise 6 percent to 289 million euros in 2013 although they dipped in the first quarter. Adidas was constantly being asked whether Rockport, which it acquired when it bought Reebok in 2006, was for sale, Hainer said, adding it had engaged investment bank Guggenheim Partners to help it analyse the market.

The world’s second-biggest sportswear firm has been losing market share in its home territory of western Europe to Nike, which is challenging the German company’s dominance in the soccer market ahead of the World Cup in Brazil next month. Herbert Hainer, who has been Adidas CEO since 2001 and recently had his contract extended until 2017, admitted the company had made “a few executional mistakes” but said a revamped executive team had the talent to revive performance. “A high-quality management team knows how to tackle challenges. And believe me, we have all the insight, character and determination to do exactly this,” Hainer told the company’s annual general meeting in the Bavarian town of Fuerth. “We will achieve most, if not all, of our ‘Route 2015’ operational targets. However, it might take a little longer than we originally anticipated,” the 59-year-old added. Adidas, which reported weak first-quarter results on Tuesday, had already warned in March that weakening emerging market currencies, notably the Russian rouble, would hurt 2014 results and pose a risk to its 2015 targets. Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment which has a 0.89 percent stake in Adidas and is its tenth-biggest investor, called on shareholders to refuse to grant the customary endorsement of management’s actions. “Even on the German football field, Nike is increasingly sidelining Adidas,” Speich told the AGM. “Athletes are measured by whether they achieve their goals - that should also apply to managers in the sporting goods industry.” Speich said Adidas shares had underperformed Nike by about 16 percent in the last 12 months, which Hainer countered by showing a chart which showed Adidas rising more over five years. “We’re going to work on regaining your confidence,” he said, inviting Speich to speak to him in person about his concerns. Despite Speich’s comments, a majority of shareholders voted to endorse the executive and supervisory boards. Nike extended its lead to take 15 percent of the global sportswear market in 2013 compared with 10.8 percent for Adidas, according to data from Euromonitor, a market research firm. Hainer, who joined Adidas in 1987 as a sales director, is the longest-serving boss among German blue-chip companies and in March also took over as chairman of soccer club Bayern Munich after Uli Hoeness was convicted for tax evasion. He said he would be defining a new long-term strategy for the period up to 2020 in coming months and pursing the generation change he has already started among management. At the AGM, he presented Roland Auschel and Eric Liedtke, the recently appointed heads of global sales and global brands,  and also noted that Mark King will take over as new head of the struggling North America business in June.

264,NKE,UPDATE 1-Shoe maker Yue Yuen suspends Vietnam production amid protests; shares slide,"(Adds quotes, share price) HONG KONG, May 14 (Reuters) - Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd, maker of footwear for companies such as Nike Inc  and Adidas, suspended production in Vietnam on Wednesday amid anti-China protests over a disputed area in the South China Sea. Thousands of Vietnamese set fire to factories and stormed industrial zones in the south of the country, with Taiwanese companies bearing the brunt of the damage, to protest against Chinese oil drilling in a part of the sea claimed by Hanoi. Yue Yuen, a $4.7 billion company controlled by Taiwan-listed Pou Chen Corp, told Reuters it was unclear if production would resume on Thursday. It added there had been no damage to factory facilities and its workers were safe. “With respect to Vietnam, we have told workers to take a day off today and the operations are closed today for the entire country,” said Jerry Shum, head of investor relations at Yue Yuen in Hong Kong. He added that the disruption on Wednesday would not have any significant impact on the business. Vietnam accounts for about a third of Yue Yuen’s global production capacity, which amounted to 313 million pairs of shoes last year. Shares of Yue Yuen slid nearly 5 percent in Hong Kong trade to their lowest since November last year, lagging a 1 percent gain for the benchmark Hang Seng Index. Pou Chen’s stock was up 0.8 percent in Taiwan. The suspension is the latest blow to Yue Yuen after thousands of workers went on strike last month at a complex in China to demand better social benefits. They returned to work at the end of April after the company agreed to meet some of their core demands.

266,NKE,Riots risk ruining Vietnam's industrial zones; lynchpin of growth,"HANOI/TAIPEI, May 16 (Reuters) - Dexter Hsu spent Tuesday night barricaded inside his workers’ dormitory in Vietnam’s Binh Duong province. Tables were stacked up against the doors, but he and his dorm-mates were terrified by the shouts and sounds of nearby rioting. Earlier that day, the Taiwanese product developer at a footwear company saw a mob of some 4,000 angry protesters riding scooters into the industrial park where he worked, smashing windows and breaking equipment. Now, he’s in hiding in a Ho Chi Minh City hotel, waiting for the order to resume work, although he said he was wondering whether in the long term he should just return home. “I’m totally helpless to control this situation and I feel like my life could come under threat,” he said in a telephone interview. Tales like Hsu’s risk undermining foreign investment in Vietnam, the lynchpin of its economy. Industrial parks have been a major driver of the country’s economic growth, accounting for more than 30 percent of Vietnam’s exports and attracting around $110 billion in foreign direct investment. Setting up shop in one of the 200-odd parks across the country saves foreign companies the bureaucratic headache of obtaining land on their own, as well as giving them easy access to electricity, water supplies and worker accommodation. That’s helped Vietnam and its army of low-wage workers carve out a niche in the global supply chain for textiles and electronics. Samsung Electronics has just opened the world’s largest smartphone factory in northern Vietnam, Intel Corp  has one of its biggest chip plants there, while Nike Inc and Adidas both buy footwear from Vietnamese factories. South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore in particular have been some of the biggest investors in the parks. That could now change. Riots in Vietnam this week, sparked by protests over China’s move to station an oil rig in waters claimed by both countries, have centred on the industrial parks, where thousands of Chinese employees live and work. Taiwanese or companies owned by Taiwanese in Vietnam are often mistakenly seen as mainland Chinese. Hundreds of companies have been forced to halt production as factories were looted, torched or damaged in the riots. In the long run, the concern for Vietnam would be that they move away altogether. “Investors cannot just pay attention to costs or quality of labour, they should also assess the likelihood of nationalist sentiments whipped up suddenly that could disrupt production,” said Leong Wai Ho, an economist for Barclays in Singapore. “The protests might be one off, but the underlying tensions and sentiments will not go away, and will probably worsen over time,” he added. Vietnam’s industrial parks employ about 2.1 million people and manufactured products worth $38 billion in exports last year. They have helped provide a bright spot in the $170 billion economy, where growth potential has been hampered by debt-ridden state-owned enterprises and corruption. A glut of bad debt caused by over-indulgent bank lending and a glacial pace of reform in the state-owned corporate sector mean Vietnam has gone from being one of Asia’s rising stars to one of the region’s biggest underperformers. This week was not the first sign of unrest at the parks; in recent years workers have been increasingly dissatisfied over labour conditions, although the authorities have until now kept any protests contained. “Local riots in response to harsh employment conditions have been quickly put down by the government,” said Suiwah Leung, associate professor of economics at Australian National University, and an expert on Vietnam. Now, the risk is that anti-foreigner antagonism mixed with unhappy workers will be harder to control and will worry foreign companies, even if they have no connection to China and events in the South China Sea. “The situation that some workers are taking advantage of their right to demonstrate by destroying factories is definitely not good for Vietnam’s investment environment,” said Nguyen Mai, chairman of the Vietnam Association of Foreign Invested Enterprises. A major downturn in foreign investment would be a big economic blow. Samsung spent $3.2 billion on its smartphone factory in the northern Thai Nguyen province. The five Vietnam-Singapore Industrial Parks, two of which were hit by this week’s riots in Binh Duong, say they host around 500 companies and have created more than 140,000 local jobs. Their tenants come from 23 different countries. The Ha Tinh industrial park in central Vietnam, where a huge steel complex being built by Taiwan’s Formosa Plastics Group was set on fire, is estimated to cost more than $20 billion by the time it is completed in 2020. For now, signs are that most foreign investors are willing to ride out the unrest. “This is a very isolated incident,” said Jason Yeo, president of the Singapore Business Association Vietnam, who has been in the country for 17 years. “The Vietnamese government (officials) are very concerned on this issue and will do their best to protect foreign investors in their country.” A spokeswoman for Singapore’s Ascendas Pte Ltd, which runs a large industrial park with Vietnam’s Protrade in Binh Duong, said that while it has bolstered security and is monitoring events, it still believes in “Vietnam’s long-term growth”. Hsu, however, is unlikely to easily put behind him the memories of Tuesday’s riots. “This is a terrifying situation, it’s the first time I’ve genuinely thought about leaving Vietnam,” he said.

268,NKE,Nike and Adidas get personal in battle over soccer World Cup,"BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. sportswear group Nike is banking on its sponsorship of more of the world’s best-known soccer stars than Adidas in its battle to overtake the German firm as the sport’s top-selling brand at its World Cup this summer.  Nike has signed six of the 10 most marketable footballers in the world, to just three for Adidas and one for smaller German brand Puma, according to a new ranking by sports marketing research group Repucom published on Wednesday. Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo, sponsored by Nike, tops the Repucom ranking, with almost 84 percent of people around the world saying they know the Real Madrid striker, helping to sell over one million shirts with his name on the back in 2013. In second place is Lionel Messi of Argentina, front man for the Adidas campaign who scores 76 percent global awareness according to Repucom - his marketability little dented by a mixed run of form for Barcelona this season. The appeal of the extrovert Ronaldo, who took the crown as the world’s best player from Messi in January, is helped by his use of Twitter, where he has 26 million followers to just two million for the more retiring Argentine.  Ronaldo probably helps sell shirts even when he isn’t wearing one - he poses nude on the cover of the latest Spanish Vogue with his model girlfriend Irina Shayk - though the branding benefits are shared as Adidas sponsors Real Madrid.  “While it is primarily about performance on the pitch, a player’s appeal is about a whole range of variables. With a footballer, you see everything, on the pitch and off the pitch, week in, week out,” said Repucom founder Paul Smith. “Athletes like Ronaldo have something unique that if you could bottle it and sell it, you would do nothing else.” Nike tries to do just that with a glitzy ad featuring Ronaldo - and Shayk - in which boys playing soccer in the local park end up scoring a penalty in a huge stadium against their heroes, including others from the Repucom top 10 such as England’s Wayne Rooney and Brazil’s Neymar. Adidas has retaliated with a new ad launched last Saturday which shows Messi dreaming about his rivals such as Bastian Schweinsteiger of Germany, Luis Suarez of Uruguay and Dani Alves of Brazil, none of whom feature in the Repucom ranking. Adidas, which has long dominated the market for soccer boots, shirts and balls, is facing a fierce challenge from Nike, the world’s biggest sportswear company that has only been a serious player in soccer for the last 20 years. While Adidas has supplied the match ball for the World Cup since 1970 and has extended its sponsorship of the competition to 2030, Nike is for the first time kitting out more teams - 10 out of 32 finalists - including hosts and favorites Brazil. Adidas, which is supplying nine teams including reigning champions Spain, as well as Argentina and Germany, expects to make a record 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion) from soccer this year, still exceeding Nike’s $2 billion of soccer turnover. “Football is the DNA of our company. We want to clearly show that we are number one in football,” Adidas Chief Executive Herbert Hainer told journalists last week, adding Adidas expected to sell significantly more balls than at the last World Cup in South Africa four years ago and about as many shirts.    Hainer acknowledged that Adidas faced a “head-to-head” race with Nike in the soccer shoe market, but predicted Adidas would still sell 2 million pairs of special World Cup boots. Nike believes it has already overtaken Adidas in boots, including in its rival’s home market Germany. While Adidas will be supplying the German kit, many of the country’s top players now wear Nike boots, with nine members of the team that started against Poland this month sporting Nike. However, Hainer dismissed suggestions Adidas had not signed the right stars, saying 14 of the 27 members of the German squad would be wearing boots with Adidas’ trademark three stripes.  Meanwhile, Puma, whose only player in the Repucom top 10 is former France striker Thierry Henry, is resorting to a stunt to attract attention: it has persuaded players such as Italy’s maverick striker Mario Balotelli, Marco Reus of Germany and Cesc Fabregas of Spain to wear one pink and one blue “Tricks” boot. “I have to be honest, the first time I saw the Tricks boots, I thought the Puma guy was mad. But when I realized he wasn’t, I was already excited,” Balotelli said.  “It is exactly the reason why I chose to be with Puma, they dare to be different and everyone knows that I do as well.” ",5272014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-world-brands/nike-and-adidas-get-personal-in-battle-over-soccer-world-cup-idUSKBN0E72TD20140527

271,NKE,"UPDATE 1-Nike, Adidas China distributor Belle warns economy's sag means 2 lean years","* Fierce competition in store and online weighs on retailers * Robust sportswear sales to outpace footwear division * Net profit rose just 1 percent in fiscal year ended Feb   (Adds comment from CEO, earnings outlook details) By Donny Kwok HONG KONG, May 27 (Reuters) - China’s biggest shoe retailer Belle International Holdings Ltd said it expects sluggish growth in the world’s second-largest economy to weigh on its earnings for the next two years after profit edged up just 1 percent in its latest fiscal year. As fierce competition in stores and online makes life tougher for China retailers, Belle is counting on robust sales of popular global sportswear brands like Nike and Adidas  to cushion a more subdued performance by the shoes it makes itself that still generate most of its profit. Chief Executive Sheng Baijiao said Belle expects strong brand recognition to help lift same-store sportswear sales by a high-single digit percentage this fiscal year, compared with 6 percent last year. Sales at its footwear division, including affordable in-house brands like Staccato and Tata targeted at younger Chinese women, should rise by a low single-digit percentage, compared with 0.6 percent last year. “We see some improvement in our same-store sales in March-May quarter as compared to the previous quarter, but (footwear business) in not out of the woods yet,” said Sheng, in charge of the largest footwear retailer in China by market value. Speaking to reporters in Hong Kong, Sheng said the company may slow down its store opening pace in the current fiscal year in wake of the weak sentiment. Retailers like conglomerate China Resources Enterprise  have reported the softer economy is already taking its toll. Some are locked in price wars that are slicing into profit margins, while a rapid expansion of department store space and a surge in online retail have diluted foot traffic in Chinese stores. With a network of nearly 20,000 stores strung across China, Belle reported net profit rose 1 percent to 5.16 billion yuan ($827 million) for the 14 months ended February, compared with 5.11 billion yuan in a comparable 14-month period ended February 2013. Belle, worth $9 billion by market value, changed its financial year-end date to the end of February from December earlier this year. For the 14 months revenue at Belle rose 10 percent to 43.06 billion yuan, up from 39.13 billion yuan in the 14 months ended February 2013. “The macroeconomic outlook for the next two years is not optimistic,” Sheng Baijiao said in a filing to the Hong Kong bourse late on Monday. “The consumer retail market is expected to be under continued pressure due to weak consumer sentiment.” Licensed sportswear sales accounted for about 39 percent of Belle’s total revenue. Belle has said that Nike and Adidas - which together make up 90 percent of the division’s sales - have much better brand recognition in China, as well as a more extensive product offering, than second-tier clients such as French retail group Kering SA’s Puma sports brand and Nike’s Converse sneakers. In the footwear division, Sheng said he expects operating profit margins to remain stable at about 22 to 24 percent. The business is more profitable than the higher-priced licensed sportswear sales because Belle can book all revenue and profit from sales of most of the brands in the footwear unit itself. The division does include some licensed international footwear brands, like Hush Puppies and Clarks. Shares of Belle were down 1.9 percent in Hong Kong, while the benchmark Hang Seng Index was off 0.04 percent. The stock, which fell nearly 50 percent last year, has dropped about 9 percent so far this year.

275,NKE,"Soccer fever helps Nike score strong sales in North America, Europe","(Reuters) - Nike Inc (NKE.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly results, as demand for its apparel and footwear rose in North America and Western Europe after the company spent heavily on marketing ahead of the 2014 soccer World Cup. Shares of the world’s largest sports wear maker rose 3.2 percent to $79.37 in extended trading. Nike, known for its distinctive ‘swoosh’ or tick logo, gets more than half of its total revenue from North America and Western Europe. Revenue from North America rose 10 percent in the fourth quarter ended May 31, while revenue from Western Europe jumped 18 percent, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations. “Nike is the number one brand in each of the top 10 cities in Western Europe,” Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards said on a post-earnings conference call. The company has been giving tough competition to Germany’s Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE) on the hotly-contested European turf. Nike has been “putting a lot of trend-right products into the marketplace, so there’s very high demand,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. Nike maintained its share of the Western Europe sportswear market at about 12 percent in 2013, while Adidas’s share shrank to 12.6 percent in the year from 13.2 percent in 2012, according to Euromonitor International data. The soccer World Cup, hosted by Brazil, marks the first time that Nike is sponsoring more national teams than Adidas. Nike signed up soccer legends Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar Jr., Eden Hazard and Wayne Rooney for commercials to promote its merchandise ahead of the much-watched event. Its “Winner Stays” commercial attracted over 82 million views on YouTube.com. The company said its marketing expenses rose 36 percent in the fourth quarter, mainly due to expenditure related to the World Cup.  Nike’s marketing expenses are expected to increase by 30 percent in the current quarter as it looks to grab the attention of soccer fans, a company executive said. Nike launched shoes branded Mercurial Superfly, Magista Obra, the Nike Hypervenom 2014 World Cup Boot and the Nike Tiempo Legend V World Cup Boot between March and May.  Ronaldo, declared the world’s best footballer after he won the coveted Ballon d’Or, is wearing the Nike Mercurial Superfly in the World Cup.  “There are more players wearing Nike boots in the World Cup than all other brands combined,” Nike’s Edwards said.  Nike said it expected “tremendous energy” around the World Cup to help its first-quarter revenue grow in low double digits in percentage terms, including the impact of currency fluctuations.  Orders for Nike-branded shoes and clothing scheduled for delivery between June and November, a gauge of demand the company calls “futures orders,” rose 12 percent globally in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations. The rise in orders was driven by Western Europe, where futures orders jumped 25 percent. Nike’s net income from continuing operations rose to $698 million, or 78 cents per share, in the quarter from $690 million, or 76 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue from continuing operations rose 13 percent to $7.43 billion, excluding currency fluctuations. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 75 cents per share and revenue of $7.34 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

280,NKE,Adidas and Nike battle for social media World Cup,"RIO DE JANEIRO/BERLIN (Reuters) - Adidas might be attracting bad online buzz for its sponsorship of biting Uruguayan footballer Luis Suarez - but in the tussle to win the most World Cup social media play, the German firm says it is winning plenty of positive attention too. With every tackle, save and goal, a simultaneous off-the-pitch marketing battle is being fought between official FIFA World Cup sponsor Adidas and arch-rival Nike Inc to dominate social media to promote their brands. The stakes are high: Despite being a World Cup sponsor since 1970, Adidas is seeing its leadership in soccer challenged by Nike, especially after the world’s biggest sportswear company dominated marketing at the 2010 competition through its savvy use of social media. But with Brazil’s World Cup on track to be the most tweeted event ever - the social media network expects far more than the 150 million tweets sent during the London Olympics in 2012 - Adidas has the perfect arena to fight back. A Reuters survey of the Twitter handles @adidasfootball and @nikefootball, using analytics website Tweetchup.com, shows Nike is slightly ahead so far in some key metrics including most retweets and the most favorite tweets during the event. “Nike is perceived by a lot of folks as if they were a sponsor even though they are not spending as much as Adidas has with FIFA,” said Opher Kahane, chief executive of marketing intelligence firm Origami Logic, which advises big brands on social media strategy including World Cup sponsor Visa. Determined to be the most talked-about brand, Adidas has set up a “newsroom” in the clubhouse of soccer club Flamengo in Rio de Janeiro, where around 50 Adidas staff generate real-time online content, including for the Twitter account of the World Cup’s official match ball - made by Adidas - the Brazuca. Tom Ramsden, Adidas marketing director for football, said up to 80 percent of people watching the World Cup will engage in social media at some point while watching a game. “It is the key platform for us to engage with our target audience, that young teenage footballer,” he told a news conference back at the firm’s German headquarters on Tuesday. Adidas publicity has not always been the type it can control however, such as when Uruguay and Liverpool striker Suarez -  its key brand figure - bit Italian Giorgio Chiellini on Tuesday. In the ensuing furor, Adidas campaign shots of Suarez baring his teeth went viral. But so, as online commentators were quick to point out, did the brand logo. “Do you think Adidas are regretting this World Cup promotional ad... or reveling in it?” wrote Twitter user @aspiringnomads. After FIFA suspended Suarez on Thursday, Adidas said it would not use him in any further World Cup marketing - but stopped short of ending its sponsorship deal with him.  The German company is aiming for soccer sales of $2.7 billion this year, and needs a World Cup boost because its revenue so far has been dented by volatile currencies in emerging markets and by tensions in Russia.  By comparison Nike, which only got going in the sport in the 1994, reported soccer revenue of $2.3 billion for the year to end May on Thursday, helping its shares jump 3.2 percent.  Nike Chief Executive Mark Parker told analysts that day: “The combination of the world’s best players and teams, our most innovative performance products and new levels of consumer engagement through social media is truly extraordinary.” There is hope for Adidas though. Data from German software firm SAP shows it is the most-talked about of the official World Cup sponsors so far, with over 67,000 mentions on social media, compared with over 40,000 for Sony and over 36,000 for Coca-Cola. The same survey showed that Nike-sponsored Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo were the most talked about players in the first two weeks of the tournament - but then fell in the ranking when England and Portugal were both eliminated. Marketing expert Kahane says while Adidas has upped its game to be more active on Facebook and Twitter, Nike is getting more “Likes” or “Favorites” - possibly because it is paying more to promote posts. The U.S. firm said its marketing expenses rose 36 percent last quarter, mainly due to World Cup spending, and are expected to increase by 30 percent in the current quarter. Further evidence that its spending is bearing fruit: two of its adverts have together attracted 380 million online views - making them three times more popular than Adidas ads, according to marketing technology firm Unruly. So far Nike has also provided more than half of the boots worn on the pitch in the tournament - and after it said it would give Brazilian player Neymar a pair of golden ones to wear in the second round, the player’s Facebook post was shared or liked 1.2 million times. But players wearing Adidas boots have so far scored more goals. Alongside Neymar, the top scorers so far - with four apiece - are Adidas-sponsored Lionel Messi of Argentina and Thomas Mueller of Germany. And the Adidas Twitter account for its “Brazuca” match ball, has attracted over two million followers and continues to generate publicity: A Brazuca Tweet featuring singer Pharrell Williams and another about a contested French goal against Honduras together collected more than 20 million retweets and favorites. “Brazuca truly is the jewel in the crown of what we have right now,” Adidas marketing director Ramsden said.

283,NKE,Soccer-Nike to end kit supply deal with Man Utd - source,"LONDON, July 7 (Reuters) - U.S. sportswear company Nike  will not renew a long-running kit supply deal with English soccer club Manchester United because of the cost of a new contract, a source with knowledge of the negotiations said. Nike has been supplying United’s famous red shirts since 2002 but the current agreement expires next year. Its withdrawal is expected to clear the way for the club to sign a lucrative new deal with German sportswear company Adidas. “Clearly Nike’s football business is booming and they could easily afford to do this (deal). They had the right to match any other offer but looking at the deal on the table, they will walk away as it doesn’t make commercial sense,” the source said. United got around 38 million pounds ($64.7 million) from the Nike deal in 2012-13, including its share of profit from the sale of merchandise around the world. Media reports had suggested the club was looking for a new deal worth around 60 million pounds per season. Nike and Adidas are battling for supremacy in the soccer kit industry, with the American company having made big inroads into a sport that its German rival long dominated. United, owned by the American Glazer family, are looking to rebuild after a disappointing season in which the 20-times English champions finished only seventh in the Premier League. The club has installed Dutchman Louis van Gaal as their new manager and he will take charge after the World Cup where he has steered the Netherlands to the semi-finals.

287,NKE,Nike to end Man Utd sponsorship citing rising cost,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. sportswear company Nike Inc (NKE.N) will not renew its long-running kit supply deal with former English soccer champions Manchester United (MANU.N) after pulling out of a bidding war with a rival. United are reported to be close to finalizing a 10-year agreement with German sportswear company Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE) that could be worth 60 million pounds ($102 million) a season, a record for a club deal. Both Adidas and United declined comment. Nike, who had sponsored United since 2002, said on Tuesday that the 2014-15 season would be its last as a partner of the 20-times English champions. The statement confirmed what a source with knowledge of the negotiations told Reuters on Monday.  “Any partnership with a club or federation has to be mutually beneficial and the terms that were on offer for a renewed contract did not represent good value for Nike’s shareholders,” the company said in a statement. Nike had the right to match any bid made by a rival but decided that the price had gone too high. Nike, the world’s largest sportswear group, and Adidas are battling for supremacy in a soccer market that the German company has long dominated. A deal with United, one of the world’s most popular teams, would be seen as an attempt to protect the German company’s leading position after Nike made strong inroads over the last two decades. United earned around 38 million pounds ($64.7 million) from the current deal in the 2012-13 season, including its share of profit from the sale of team merchandise around the world. United recently launched the team’s new kit for the 2014-15 season, which bears the name of new sponsor Chevrolet for the first time and will be the last shirt with the Nike swoosh on it.

290,NKE,Adidas 2 Nike 0 in World Cup final but competition goes on,"BERLIN (Reuters) - With Adidas sponsoring both teams in Sunday’s World Cup final, the German sportswear brand has declared victory over U.S. rival Nike in the latest round of its battle to remain the biggest global soccer brand. The two companies dominate a soccer kit industry worth more than $5 billion a year, sharing more than 80 percent of the market for many products, but Nike has been threatening Adidas’ leadership, including in its home territory of western Europe. While Adidas has supplied the match ball for the World Cup since 1970, Nike kitted out more teams at the competition in Brazil for the first time, 10 out of the 32 teams including the hosts, compared with nine for Adidas. However, the three stripes of Adidas will dominate the pitch  on Sunday, on both teams’ jerseys for the first time since 1990 and on many of their star players’ boots as well as the match officials’ clothing and the ball. “Adidas will be the most visible brand by far in the World Cup final,” said Chief Executive Herbert Hainer, who had predicted a Germany-Argentina final well before the two teams beat Nike-backed Brazil and the Netherlands in the semis. “We are once again underlining our position as the world’s leading football brand. Adidas is the clear number one in football globally,” Hainer added in a statement. It is not clear how long that will last. Adidas expects record soccer sales of $2.7 billion in 2014, topping the $2.3 billion Nike reported for its financial year to end May. While the periods are not directly comparable, Nike has suggested the U.S. firm could exceed the Adidas figure for 2014 in its fiscal 2014/15.  Despite the fact Nike teams did not make the final, the Portland-based firm which has only been a serious player in soccer since the World Cup was held in the United States in 1994, sees no sign of growth in soccer slowing down.  Chief Executive Mark Parker says Nike has already overtaken Adidas in boot sales in most countries and predicts a repeat in the current fiscal year of the 21 percent rise in soccer sales the company saw in 2013/14. “The United States offers huge potential in particular, enthusiasm for football is there in any case. And in China there are tremendous growth opportunities,” Parker told Germany’s Handelsblatt daily in an interview published on Wednesday. The determination of Adidas to stay ahead in the sport is set to be underlined by a pricey long-term kit supply deal it is expected to seal with English soccer club Manchester United, replacing Nike.  Adidas shares, hit in recent months by exposure to Russia and other volatile emerging markets, fell to a 16-month low on Wednesday on concerns around the price of the Manchester United deal. The stock was down 0.8 percent by 1106 GMT. “The possible deal with Manchester United would lead to rising marketing costs and the profit dynamism of Adidas is also weak,” said Warburg Research analyst Joerg Frey. Adidas, whose sponsorship of each World Cup is estimated to cost about $100 million, predicted a “modest increase” in sales and marketing costs in 2014 due to the competition, without giving figures. Nike said total marketing expenses rose 36 percent to $876 million in the quarter to end May, mainly due to expenditure related to the World Cup, with an executive predicting a rise of 30 percent in the current quarter too. The German company, which was founded by shoe maker Adi Dassler in 1949, admits it faces a “head-to-head” race with Nike in the boot business, but has predicted it would sell 2 million pairs of the special shoes it designed for the World Cup with striking black and white patterns. Nike has not given a forecast for World Cup boot or shirt sales. According to sports app theScore, players wearing the Adidas boots scored 78 of the 166 World Cup goals so far, not counting penalties, including five of Germany’s seven semi-final goals against Brazil. Nike players scored 73 and other brands 15. Adidas players dominate the list of top World Cup scorers, including Colombia’s James Rodriguez, Argentina’s Lionel Messi and Thomas Mueller and Andre Schuerrle of Germany. Brazil’s Neymar, who Nike provided with golden boots from the second round, was also a big scorer but missed the semi-final due to a serious back injury. Other top Nike players like Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal and Rooney of England had disappointing tournaments. While most national team jerseys are sold ahead of the World Cup or in the early stages, Euromonitor’s Kondej said Brazil’s failure to reach the final could dampen Nike sales of Brazil shirts both in the host nation and abroad in coming months. Adidas said it expected to sell more than 8 million World Cup shirts, including more than 2 million of the Germany jersey, with more than half a million of those sold outside Europe. Adidas and Nike have also fought a fierce battle off the pitch to grab attention on social media, with Adidas setting up a “newsroom” in Rio to generate real-time content after Nike dominated unofficial marketing at the 2010 competition.  While Nike started the competition with more hits for its videos and posts, Adidas has pulled ahead in the last two weeks, with Adidas scoring nine million views for its clips on YouTube to three million for Nike, according to marketing intelligence firm Origami Logic, which advises big brands on social media.

292,NKE,Man Utd still tops sponsors' league after poor season,"* Adidas has offered upwards of 60 mln pounds a season -source * Adidas’s 10-year deal will replace Nike from 2015 * Man Utd’s commercial appeal has survived a poor season * Its sponsorship deals are priced about twice rivals’ By Keith Weir LONDON, July 11 (Reuters) - A wretched season and exile from European soccer’s top club competition have done nothing to dim Manchester United’s commercial appeal, with the team set to sign a sportswear deal with Adidas worth twice what rivals have been earning. That partnership and a shirt sponsorship with car brand Chevrolet, which also set a new benchmark for the sport, will help to underwrite the rebuilding of the team under new manager Louis van Gaal. Negotiations for a new kit supply deal were a test of United’s marketing muscle after a season in which the team won nothing and finished too low in the Premier League even to qualify for the lucrative European Champions League. The normally bullish Nike pulled out of contract renewal talks, saying that the price had gone too high and signalling an end to a partnership dating back to 2002. A source with knowledge of the negotiations said rival Adidas had offered upwards of 60 million pounds ($102 million) a season for a 10-year deal that will see it replace Nike from 2015. The current Nike deal was worth 38 million pounds to United in 2012-13, including a share of the earnings from the sale of shirts and other merchandise to fans around the world. United, majority owned by the American Glazer family and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, are determined to ensure that last season was a one-off failure and have replaced manager David Moyes after a short and unhappy tenure. “Brands are about the history and the promise that will continue into the future,” said Peter Walshe, a global account director with marketing company Millward Brown. “There is a lot of excitement about the future after the disastrous handover to Moyes,” he added. “It shows the United brand is bigger than one decision or individual.” English champions a record 20 times, United have built up a huge global following over the decades thanks to players like George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. Just before their stock market flotation in 2012, United produced a survey showing they had 659 million global followers - not far short of one in 10 of the population. That appeal helped persuade General Motors to put its Chevrolet brand on the team’s red shirts in a deal worth $559 million that will run until 2021. As with the sportswear sponsorship, that was double the going rate for most major European teams. “The key thing here is the increasing power that the brand has internationally,” said Andy Sutherden, global head of sports marketing and sponsorship at communications firm H+K Strategies. “The pool of fans from all over the world is the asset that they sell,” he added. Indeed, the focus for General Motors will be the Asian markets where United is popular, as the car maker is pulling the Chevrolet brand out of European markets. United this week launched their new red shirts bearing the Chevrolet logo, a kit that will be the last one featuring the Nike swoosh and will be worn through the 2014-15 season. For Adidas, the United deal fits with a strategy of defending market leadership in soccer against the advances made by larger American rival Nike, which has been involved in the sport for only two decades. “If you can keep out a key rival that is worth a lot more to you rather than just the positive value of having that brand,” said Millward Brown’s Walshe. United fans on social media reacted positively to the prospect of Adidas returning as kit supplier, reviving a partnership from the 1980s. Nike had the right to match the bid from its rival, but walked away, saying it did not offer good value for shareholders. More than 2 million United shirts are sold every year, which will help Adidas to recoup its investment, provided the team can return to the top of the European game. That is where Dutchman Van Gaal comes in, fresh from taking a workmanlike Netherlands team to the World Cup semi-final this week. Just as importantly, he appears to have some of the aura of  former manager Alex Ferguson, who retired last year after winning 13 Premier League titles in two decades. “What van Gaal has done with the Netherlands whets the appetite of fans and sponsors alike,” said Sutherden. “He has done enough with Holland to show he is a manager who will create a positive and immediate impact.”  ($1 = 0.5877 British Pounds)   (Writing by Keith Weir; Editing by Will Waterman)",7112014,http://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-manchester-utd-finances/man-utd-still-tops-sponsors-league-after-poor-season-idUSL6N0PL2GU20140711
293,NKE,"CORRECTED-RPT-As giant U.S. IPO nears, Alibaba's China e-commerce crown slips","(Corrects paragraph one of March 17 story to reflect Ma’s apartment had more than one room) * Share of China online retail fell for first time in 2013 * IPO in U.S. could exceed Facebook’s $16 bln in value * Tencent, JD.com tie-up sharpens e-commerce challenge * Niche players, retail brands also step up competition By Adam Jourdan SHANGHAI, March 17 (Reuters) - Alibaba’s dominance of online retail in China faces its biggest-ever challenge as the firm founded by Jack Ma in an apartment 15 years ago lines up a U.S. initial public offering that could value the firm at around $140 billion. In a rare blip, Alibaba Group Holdings lost market share last year while its nearest rivals all grew, according to Euromonitor. The market research firm sees China’s internet retail market tripling from 2012 to over $300 billion in 2018 as the country’s smartphone-savvy shoppers buy everything from plane tickets to sneakers online. China’s biggest social media company, Tencent Holdings Ltd , is leading the revolt, linking the country’s most popular messaging app, WeChat, with the number two e-commerce player, JD.com. An array of smaller rivals is also clawing away at Alibaba’s lead, while household retail names like Nike Inc and Gap Inc are increasingly striking out away from the giant’s Tmall electronic platform to set up more distinctive online stores of their own. “In China shopping is a social activity. You want to tell friends about it, recommend it - it’s a smartphone activity, and whoever owns that organisational ability also has a hold over how a person shops,” said Frank Lavin, Hong Kong-based chief executive of Export Now. Lavin’s company helps global firms set up shop in China through Alibaba’s Tmall. Alibaba’s e-commerce prospects at home loom large after Ma’s firm said on Sunday it was starting plans for a long-awaited listing in the U.S. - potentially the biggest-ever IPO by an Internet company - which could surpass the $16 billion raised by social media giant Facebook Inc in 2012. Alibaba still held a sturdy 45.1 percent of China’s e-commerce market last year, down from 46.1 percent a year earlier, according to Euromonitor, and remains bullish in the face of Tencent, JD.com and others. It is beefing up its mobile services to keep up with China’s legions of smartphone users. Alibaba did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story, though the firm’s executive vice chairman Joe Tsai was upbeat about the firm’s e-commerce prospects in an interview with Reuters in Hong Kong last week. Alibaba is now battling rivals on multiple fronts. Alongside JD.com, heading for a $1.5 billion IPO of its own in the U.S., are well-funded vehicles like household appliance retailer Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd and Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s grocery retailer Yihaodian. Smaller niche players like cosmetics specialist Vipshop Holdings Ltd are also growing in stature. And with global and local brands peeling away from Tmall, the trend is likely to see Alibaba’s market share extend its fall, said Bryan Wang, Beijing-based vice president for Forrester Research. “We have definitely seen a lot more customers asking us in the last year about how to get away from Tmall,” said Wang. Popular Internet clothing retailer HSTYLE has partly flown the nest. Competing with brands like H&M; and Uniqlo, it has branched out from just having a Tmall outlet and now books half its sales through its own site and on JD.com and Tencent. “As a mature Internet brand we’re looking to provide more individual service to our shoppers,” Zhao Yingguang, founder and chairman of HSTYLE, told Reuters in an interview, describing his brand as one of the leading women’s apparel retailers on Alibaba’s platforms. “We go and sell our products where the consumers are.” Alibaba’s vast resources have helped it see off weaker players so far such as Otto Group, 139shop.com, Mecox Lane, Newegg.com and others, but the remaining contenders are more seasoned in competition with Alibaba - and ambitious. JD.com still lags some way behind Alibaba in second place with a 14 percent market share last year, up fractionally from a year earlier. But its IPO plans and the deal with Tencent - a less well-known name outside China than Alibaba, but worth almost $150 billion by market value - will give it new financial and operational resources. Tencent, meanwhile, hopes its JD.com tie-up will help it to extend its presence in “the fast-growing physical goods e-commerce market”, Tencent president Martin Lau said in a statement. The deal also arms JD.com with the 225 million monthly active users of the WeChat messaging service in China. As well as technology leading change, consumers themselves are developing new habits, becoming more picky and looking to get more for their money. “I am leaning toward specialist stores now, because the service is often better than the giant retailers and the delivery I always find is faster,” said Grace Lin, 20, a student in Shanghai. “It’s not necessarily that I use Tmall less now, but I do use other stores more.” Lin often shops on cosmetics specialist Vipshop’s online site. The firm saw revenue climb 145 percent in 2013, while customer numbers shot up 130 percent over the same period, according to an earnings conference call this month. Vipshop almost doubled its market share to 1.8 percent last year. Suning, a traditional electronics retailer with a strong bricks and mortar presence, is bulking up its online presence, as is rival Bain Capital-backed Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd. Both raised their market share last year. Yihaodian leverages majority owner Wal-Mart’s global name and product range, while other niche players such as Jumei and Yesmywine.com corner specific markets in cosmetics and alcohol. Alibaba’s Jack Ma has locked horns repeatedly of late with his rival at Tencent, co-founder Pony Ma - a namesake but unrelated. Rhetoric from the two internet giants has grown increasingly barbed as competition has raged from gaming and microblogs, to taxi hire app price wars and online payment systems that are now the subject of close scrutiny by China’s central bank. When Tencent launched a “red envelope” feature for WeChat, which let users send money gifts by smartphone over the Chinese New Year, Jack Ma wrote it was a “Pearl Harbour attack” on his company’s Alipay payment system, referring to the unexpected bombing of the American port during World War II. Tencent said over 8 million people used the WeChat feature. Alibaba-invested Weibo Corp, a popular Twitter-like social media platform, filed for a $500 million U.S. IPO of its own on Friday, as it looks to defend its position against fierce competition from Tencent’s WeChat. WeChat does indeed present a threat to Alibaba. In a research report in December, Standard Chartered said its payment function, known in Chinese as Weixin, paired with its wide popularity, could be a “killer weapon” for Tencent to take market share in mobile e-commerce. China has some of the most active mobile web users in the world. The country’s mobile Internet users hit 500 million in 2013, and is estimated to hit 750 million by 2017, according to data from China-based consultancy iResearch. “The wind is blowing against Alibaba and the biggest risk is coming from the mobile sector,” said Zhang Chenhao, executive director at e-commmerce-focused investment advisory firm Gold Sand Capital. “Firms are all lining up - the school of Tencent or the school of Alibaba - and the camps are forming,” said Zhang.

294,NKE,"Nike has most Europe soccer deals, Adidas the most lucrative: study","BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. sportswear group Nike will supply shirts to more teams in the top five European soccer leagues this season than Adidas, but the German firm has cornered the most lucrative clubs, a study showed on Wednesday. Sports marketing research group Repucom said Nike had outpaced Adidas in Europe for the first time since the 2009/10 season to supply 26 of the region’s top clubs, up five compared with last year. Adidas is supplying 18, down four from last year. Although it has been a serious player in soccer only since 1994, Nike is now threatening Adidas’s leadership in the sport. At the World Cup in Brazil, it supplied more teams for the first time and put its boots on more than half the players. Nike is ahead of Adidas in four of the five top European leagues. The exception is the English Premier League, the most lucrative with more than 5 million shirts sold last season. Adidas has five English Premier sides, including Chelsea, compared with four for German rival Puma and three for Nike.  “Whilst Nike looks to maximize the number of teams it supplies, Adidas is going for the most popular, most followed and ultimately biggest selling clubs in the world,” Repucom soccer expert Andrew Walsh said.  Nike has signed more top teams in Spain, Germany, France and Italy, a total of 23, compared with 13 for Adidas and five for Puma. Repucom said 3 million Spanish club shirts were sold last season, compared with 2.3 million for the Bundesliga and about 1.2 million in each of the top leagues in France and Italy. “Adidas and Nike, with Puma in third place, have managed to keep a good headlock on the market,” Walsh said, noting that U.S. brand Under Armour had not managed to sign another top side after English Premier club Tottenham Hotspur. Adidas last month struck a record $1.3 billion shirt deal with Manchester United to oust Nike from the former English champions from the 2015/16 season, and it will also replace Nike at Italian champions Juventus next year. Adidas expects record soccer sales of $2.7 billion in 2014, topping the $2.3 billion Nike reported for its financial year to end-May. While the periods are not directly comparable, Nike has suggested the U.S. company could exceed the Adidas figure for 2014 in its 2014/15 financial year. Puma, the world’s no. 3 sportswear firm, has replaced Nike as the kit supplier at Arsenal from this season as part of a strategy to restore a reputation for performance gear after it shifted too far into fashion.

Adidas is supplying 18, down four from last year. Although it has been a serious player in soccer only since 1994, Nike is now threatening Adidas’s leadership in the sport. At the World Cup in Brazil, it supplied more teams for the first time and put its boots on more than half the players. Nike is ahead of Adidas in four of the five top European leagues. The exception is the English Premier League, the most lucrative with more than 5 million shirts sold last season. Adidas has five English Premier sides, including Chelsea, compared with four for German rival Puma and three for Nike. “Whilst Nike looks to maximise the number of teams it supplies, Adidas is going for the most popular, most followed and ultimately biggest selling clubs in the world,” Repucom soccer expert Andrew Walsh said. Nike has signed more top teams in Spain, Germany, France and Italy, a total of 23, compared with 13 for Adidas and five for Puma. Repucom said 3 million Spanish club shirts were sold last season, compared with 2.3 million for the Bundesliga and about 1.2 million in each of the top leagues in France and Italy. “Adidas and Nike, with Puma in third place, have managed to keep a good headlock on the market,” Walsh said, noting that U.S. brand Under Armour had not managed to sign another top side after English Premier club Tottenham Hotspur. Adidas last month struck a record $1.3 billion shirt deal with Manchester United to oust Nike from the former English champions from the 2015/16 season, and it will also replace Nike at Italian champions Juventus next year. Adidas expects record soccer sales of $2.7 billion in 2014, topping the $2.3 billion Nike reported for its financial year to end-May. While the periods are not directly comparable, Nike has suggested the U.S. company could exceed the Adidas figure for 2014 in its 2014/15 financial year. Puma, the world’s no. 3 sportswear firm, has replaced Nike as the kit supplier at Arsenal from this season as part of a strategy to restore a reputation for performance gear after it shifted too far into fashion.

296,NKE,Adidas to hike marketing spend by 1 pct of sales,"BERLIN, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Adidas, the world’s second-biggest sportswear firm, will increase its spending on marketing by 1 percent of sales as it seeks to halt the advance of market leader Nike following a profit warning last week. The German group said it planned to increase its target range for marketing spending to 13-14 percent of sales from a previous 12-13 percent. Adidas spent about 12.4 percent of its 14.5 billion euros of revenue on sales and marketing in 2013. Adidas last week cut its sales and net income targets for 2014 and scrapped its goals for 2015, blaming the move on poor performance at its golf business and volatile emerging market currencies, particularly the Russian rouble. Chief Executive Herbert Hainer said Adidas now planned to add only 80 more stores in Russia this year, down from a previously-planned 150, with a similar figure for 2015. That move, as well as a more promotional environment in Russia, would cut around 50 million euros from operating profit in the second half, while a planned restructuring at the golf unit would mean a hit of 50-60 million euros.

297,NKE,Adidas marketing push an uphill battle against 'cool' Nike,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Sportswear firm Adidas (ADSGn.DE) probably thought it had hit the marketing jackpot when Adidas-sponsored Germany beat Adidas-sponsored Argentina to win the Adidas-sponsored World Cup.    But arch rival Nike (NKE.N) may have stolen much of its soccer branding thunder with quirky videos, innovative boots and amusing Tweets, not to mention the odd sponsorship coup of its own such as signing up hosts Brazil.    Adidas said it had secured “victory on and off the pitch” at the soccer tournament, providing the highest-scoring boots and generating 22 percent more discussion on social media than Nike. But more than half the players displayed Nike’s brightly-colored shoes and it was one of Nike’s new lightweight “Flyknit” boots worn by Germany’s Mario Goetze that volleyed in the winning goal.     Nike has been eating into its German rival’s market share and some branding experts and investors don’t believe throwing more cash into marketing will necessarily fix the problem.    Instead, Adidas needs to spot and set more trends and create a buzz among fashion and sports-mad youngsters.    “At the moment, Nike is cool, very cool. If you ask a 20-year-old, they are not going to pick Adidas right now,” said Tammy Smulders, head of marketing consultancy SCB Partners.    “It is not as easy as just writing a check. They need to be doing more of the viral, underground activities which brings out the cool factor of the brand.” MARKETING SPEND    After recently issuing its third profit warning in a year, Adidas said on Thursday it would boost spending on marketing to about 13 percent of sales in 2014 and to between 13 and 14 percent of sales in 2015.     The company also said it would give marketing experts more responsibility and bring them closer to sales and product development staff.    Adidas spent 12.4 percent of its 2013 revenue of 14.5 billion euros ($19.4 billion) on sales and marketing, up from 12.1 percent in 2012 and already well above Nike, which spent 10.8 percent of sales of $27.8 billion in the year to May 31.    Adidas chief Herbert Hainer admitted the company, known for its three stripes logo, was being taken on even on its home turf. But he said second-quarter results – including double-digit growth in Germany, Britain, Spain and Italy and a 41 percent jump in soccer sales – showed Adidas was fighting back.    While Nike can focus on its “swoosh” logo and the “Just do it” slogan it has used since 1988, Adidas has to spread its ad budget across a range of brands such as Reebok, TaylorMade golf and Rockport shoes, as well as its Originals and NEO sports-inspired fashion labels.    “They are fighting fires everywhere. Pouring money into marketing might put out some fires, but they will continue to burn elsewhere,” said Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment which has a 1.2 percent stake in Adidas and has repeatedly criticized management in recent months.     While Nike has encroached on Adidas’s home territory, the German firm has failed to make serious inroads in North America. The U.S. firm extended its lead to take a 15 percent global market share in 2013 compared with 10.8 percent for Adidas, according to Euromonitor.    Nike has focused on exploiting social media to target young consumers, while Adidas has relied more on official partnerships with the likes of the FIFA World Cup and the National Basketball Association (NBA).     Nike’s animated film “The Last Game”, featuring soccer stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar on a quest to save football from the hands of a villainous mastermind, has become one of Facebook’s most shared posts ever.    “Nike is the cheeky challenger doing guerrilla ambush marketing, whereas Adidas follows the more orthodox line,” said Andrew Walsh at sports marketing research group Repucom.     The value of the Nike brand rose 13 percent in 2013 to $17 billion, making it the world’s 24th most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand, more than double the value of Adidas on $7.5 billion.    Even though Adidas was thought to have forked out about $100 million to FIFA to sponsor the World Cup, two Nike World Cup ads are among the top 10 most shared ad videos so far this year, according to marketing technology company Unruly. No Adidas videos feature in that ranking, though it says its videos published during the tournament made it the most-viewed sports brand on YouTube.    “Quite a lot of people thought Nike was the official sponsor. They manage to get the benefits without as large an upfront investment,” said Leah Donlan, marketing lecturer at Manchester Business School.     Adidas has started to replicate Nike’s tactics, setting up a “news room” in Rio during the World Cup to generate a stream of social media chatter on its sponsored teams and players. Investment in social media will be a big part of its increased marketing spending and it plans to open similar news rooms in key cities around the world to continue its engagement with fans. But Nike is also investing, launching an interactive Football app. It is kitting out more of Europe’s top clubs, such as Barcelona and Paris St Germain, for the 2014/15 season, even though Adidas is ousting Nike at Manchester United (MANU.N) and Italian champions Juventus from next year. Adidas CEO Hainer said the record $1.3 billion shirt deal struck with Manchester United last month - almost three times per year what Nike has been paying the former English champions - and the signing of four of the top six National Basketball Association (NBA) draft players - showed he meant business. “We have three out of the four biggest symbols in the football club world with Real (Madrid), Bayern (Munich) and ManU. This gives us huge reach,” he said, predicting the ManU deal will generate sales of 1.5 billion pounds ($2.5 billion). But not everybody is convinced.    “The ManU deal is too expensive. It might bring management top-line growth and exposure in emerging markets, but means that the expected margin improvement will be delayed,” said Stefan-Guenter Bauknecht, fund manager at Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management, which holds a 1.4 percent stake in Adidas.    “The strategy has changed from profitable growth towards building up the top line and the brand image against Nike.”    Adidas acknowledges it has cut its 2014 target for its operating margin - operating income as a proportion of sales - to between 6.5 and 7.0 percent for 2014, from 8.5 to 9.0 percent, partly due to higher marketing spend.  Nike recorded an operating margin of 13 percent in the fiscal year to May 31. “We know driving higher levels of profitability is absolutely critical to our long-term success, and we will get there. But we will not get there if we are not constantly winning in the marketplace,” Hainer said.          Adidas shares, down 39 percent this year after tumbling since last week’s profit warning, trade at 16.9 times forward earnings to 22 times for Nike and almost 62 times for fast-growing U.S. upstart Under Armour Inc (UA.N). The success of Nike’s “Flyknit” shoes worn by Goetze - made out of machine-knitted fiber rather than stitched-together pieces - is just the latest example of the U.S. firm’s ability to innovate and set trends after its popular wearable “FuelBand” fitness device and “Free” barefoot-feel running shoes.    The Portland, Oregon-based firm has also arguably been quicker than Adidas to respond to booming demand for sportswear from women that has helped drive the rise of yoga specialist Lululemon (LULU.O). Adidas says it has run campaigns targeted at women in the United States and China in the last year. The biggest recent innovation hit Adidas can boast of - which it will now be marketing even harder - is the “Boost” cushioning technology initially developed for running shoes that it is now rolling out to other sports. It expects to sell 8 million pairs of the shoes this year and 15 million in 2015.    A Cowen survey of 2,500 U.S. consumers published last month showed 43 percent named Nike as their first choice of athletic apparel, compared with just 13 percent for Adidas, 6 percent for its Reebok brand, and 14 percent for Under Armour. More than three-quarters of respondents saw Nike as a cool brand.    Adidas is also struggling to dent Nike’s dominance at home despite acquiring golf market leader TaylorMade in 1997 and Reebok in 2006. Euromonitor data showed its U.S. market share falling to 5.4 percent in 2013, while Nike grew to 20.2 percent.     Adidas has not been helped by repeated injuries to basketball star Derrick Rose, whom it signed in 2012 in a 13-year $185 million deal, the biggest ever. In addition to its latest NBA signings, it plans to spend more on marketing “Boost” in a new basketball range this fall.    But Berenberg analyst John Guy said Adidas - under new Americas president Mark King - would be better off investing in its Originals, Boost and Reebok brands, given Nike’s dominance in basketball where it has about a 90 percent market share.    “We continue to question the logic of sizeable investments in basketball, where key-man risk is high and endorsement contracts are expensive,” said Guy, who rates Adidas a “sell”.    CEO Hainer said Adidas will launch its most ambitious brand campaign to date in 2015 after its current “All in or Nothing” slogan, used since the 2012 Olympics in London.    It will also be pushing new collaborations for its Originals label with celebrities Kanye West and Pharrell Williams and is optimistic for new products like relaunches of classic sneaker brand ZX Flux.    Marketing specialist Donlan says investing in building a brand is a long-term project that could take three to five years. But some investors are becoming impatient.    “Management must be shown a yellow card,” said Bauknecht at Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management. “There is not much more room for disappointment.”     (1 US dollar = 0.7486 euro) ",8082014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-adidas-nike-rivalry-analysis/adidas-marketing-push-an-uphill-battle-against-cool-nike-idUSKBN0G81MP20140808
298,NKE,Under Armour looking to lure Durant away from Nike -ESPN.com,"Aug 21 (Reuters) - Sports apparel retailer Under Armour  is looking to lure NBA most valuable player Kevin Durant away from rival Nike in a deal worth as much as $285 million over 10 years, ESPN.com reported on Thursday. The deal, sources told the website, includes Under Armour stock and other incentives, such a community center built in Durant’s mother’s name. Nike would have the right to match the deal, which is a condition of Durant’s current contract with the Beaverton, Oregon-based athletic-apparel giant, the website reported. Durant, who played high school ball in Maryland, would represent a major coup for Under Armour, a Baltimore-based company looking to put a dent in Nike’s dominance in basketball apparel. A five-time All-Star for the Oklahoma City Thunder, Durant is one of the league’s most popular players, respected for both his on-the-court prowess as well as his humble demeanor. ESPN said Durant’s representation, Roc Nation Sports, told Nike on Wednesday that he has a 10-year deal on the table with Under Armour worth between $265 million and $285 million. Nike’s last offer, sources told the website, would have given the 25-year-old Durant a base and a minimum royalty guarantee that would equal no less than $20 million a year. Under Armour could not be reached for comment. ",8212014,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N0QR2B920140821
299,NKE,"Durant re-signs with Nike, spurning Under Armour deal","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Reigning National Basketball Association MVP Kevin Durant has signed a new shoe deal with sports apparel retailer Nike, spurning a deal from rival Under Armour that reportedly was worth as much as $285 million over 10 years. “We are pleased to extend our relationship with Kevin Durant, one of the most exciting players in the game,” Nike spokesman Brian Strong said Monday in an e-mail to Reuters. Strong declined to reveal the terms of the deal. Durant, 25, one of the NBA’s top shooters, has averaged 27.4 points per game since coming into the league seven years ago. The Oklahoma City Thunder forward, a five-time All-Star, averaged 32 points a game last season when he ended LeBron James’ two-year run as the NBA’s most valuable player. Under Armour’s proposed deal, sources told ESPN.com, was worth between $265 million and $285 million and included company stock and other incentives, such a community center named after Durant’s mother. “Excited and humbled to sign back with the swoosh!” Durant said in a tweet late Sunday.

301,NKE,WRAPUP 1-NFL's Vikings say they erred in light Peterson punishment,"Sept 17 (Reuters) - The Minnesota Vikings “made a mistake” in not initially suspending star player Adrian Peterson until his child-abuse case is resolved, the team’s owners said on Wednesday, as sporting goods maker Nike halted its contract with the All-Pro running back. The Vikings’ apology is the latest mea culpa to come from the NFL as the powerful sports league grapples with a spate of domestic violence cases that have raised questions about the league’s integrity and leadership of commissioner Roger Goodell. The team, which on Monday reactivated Peterson for this Sunday’s NFL game following his indictment last week in Texas in a case involving his 4-year-old son, reversed course by placing Peterson on a special exempt list that suspends him from all team activities. “We made a mistake, and we needed to get this right,” Vikings co-owner Zygi Wilf said at a news conference. “It is important to always listen to our fans, the community and our sponsors,” Wilf added. “Our goal is to always make the decision we feel is right for the Minnesota Vikings.” Peterson, 29, stands accused of reckless or negligent injury to a child, stemming from a whipping incident that allegedly left bruises and wounds on his son. “This is a good decision that will allow Adrian Peterson to resolve his personal situation and the Vikings to return the focus to the football field,” the NFL said of the decision to place Peterson on paid leave. The Vikings will continue to pay Peterson his full $11.75 million salary for this season. Nike Inc, one of Peterson’s sponsors and which has a reputation for steadfastly sticking by its top athletes, said it had suspended its contract with the running back. “Nike in no way condones child abuse or domestic violence of any kind and we have shared our concerns with the NFL,” the Oregon-based sporting goods company said in a statement. “We have suspended our contract with Adrian Peterson.” The league has been publicly chastised by one of its top sponsors, beer brewer Anheuser-Busch. Several other sponsors, such as McDonald’s Corp, Visa Inc and Campbell Soup Co, said they have communicated their  concerns to the NFL about its handling of domestic violence cases. Goodell and the league are already struggling to make amends for his initial lenient punishment of former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, who punched his then-fiancee, now his wife, in February, striking her unconscious. Goodell has since apologized for the handling of the Rice case and suspended Rice indefinitely. The Pro Bowl running back appealed his suspension on Tuesday. Two other players involved in domestic violence cases are Carolina Panthers’ Greg Hardy and San Francisco 49ers’ Ray McDonald.

304,NKE,UPDATE 2-Adidas shares jump on report of hedge fund activism,"* Shares up 4 pct * Long-serving CEO under pressure * Adidas in “open, constructive” dialogue with investors * Adidas loses ground to Nike in western Europe   (Adds investor, analyst comment, background) By Jörn Poltz MUNICH, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Shares in sportswear maker Adidas jumped on Wednesday on a report that a group of hedge funds is seeking to buy a stake to pressure management to make sweeping changes, although one of the funds dismissed this. Germany’s manager magazin said hedge funds including Knight Vinke, Third Point and TCI were considering buying stake in the world’s second-largest sportswear company, driving a 4 percent jump in its shares. But Eric Knight, founder of activist fund Knight Vinke, poured cold water on the report: “We don’t have a shareholding and it’s not something we’re following,” Knight told Reuters. Citing unnamed financial sources, the magazine said the funds would seek radical changes at Adidas, including the removal of Chief Executive Herbert Hainer and the possible spin off of fitness brand Reebok and golf label TaylorMade. An Adidas spokeswoman declined to comment on the magazine report. But she also said: “We constantly conduct an open and constructive dialogue with investors.” TCI and Third Point declined to comment. Adidas has been losing market share in its home territory of western Europe to larger U.S. rival Nike and has failed to make serious inroads in North America despite buying golf market leader TaylorMade in 1997 and Reebok in 2006. The company issued its third profit warning in a year in July, blaming a plunge in sales at its golf business and its exposure to a weak Russian market. Adidas shares, which have fallen by more than a third this year, were up 4.1 percent by 1334 GMT, leading a 0.5 percent rise in the German DAX index. They had already risen earlier this week on a Wall Street Journal report that unnamed investors had met with the company to demand management changes, including the possible early replacement of Hainer, CEO since 2001. “The stock is trading with a management discount,” Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment which is the ninth-biggest investor in Adidas with a 1.2 percent stake, told Reuters. Speich, who called unsuccessfully on shareholders in May to refuse to grant the customary endorsement of management’s actions, said that Adidas’ diminished market capitalisation of 12 billion euros ($15.6 billion) could make it easy for hedge funds to build up an influential stake. But Equinet analyst Ingbert Faust, rejected the possibility that Hainer would be easily unseated. “Of course some investors are unhappy for good reason,” he said. “I don’t expect the dismissal of the executive board ... Such reports are really worthless. The fact that they move the share price shows that the stock is undervalued.” Hainer had his contract extended until 2017 earlier this year to allow the company to work on a succession plan. He has recently overhauled top management, appointing Roland Auschel and Eric Liedtke as new heads of global sales and global brands.

305,NKE,Cambodia deploys troops as garment workers renew wage campaign,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia deployed armed troops in its capital on Wednesday as garment workers held rallies to revive a campaign for higher wages that had helped to stoke a year-long political crisis. About 500 textile workers rallied in an industrial suburb of Phnom Penh, demanding a sharp hike in the monthly minimum wage to $177 from $100, as dozens of soldiers armed with assault rifles watched. Witnesses said army helicopters flew over the factories earlier. About 100 police were also deployed at economic zones in Svay Rieng province, bordering Vietnam, where garment workers also gathered, Pav Sina, president of the Collective Union Movement of Workers, told Reuters.     “Why is our government so afraid of its own people, especially people who are only protesting to earn a basic salary?” said Naly Pilorge, director of rights group Licadho. Licardo said two union leaders were arrested by police. But no incidents of violence were reported. The growth of the garment sector has become a vital but troublesome issue for the government of long-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen. It has been a boon for the fledgling economy, providing as many as half a million jobs and generating $5 billion annually, but frequent protests by increasingly assertive unions have tested the government’s patience. At stake if the campaign leads to prolonged strikes is the possibility of reduced orders from firms that outsource to Cambodian factories, such as Gap, Nike, H & M Hennes & Mauritz and Zara, owned by Inditex.  “We want to send a message to all buyers that they must provide a basic wage,” Ath Thon, president of the biggest independent union, the Coalition of Cambodian Apparel Workers Democratic Union, told reporters at the rally. Cambodia’s garment sector is dwarfed by those in China and Vietnam, but lower wages have lured brands to the country. However, complaints about “sweat shop” working conditions and a crackdown by security forces in January, which killed at least five people, could damage the reputations of the brands. Instability in Cambodia comes as Myanmar offers generous tax breaks to manufacturers and Vietnam, which exported $18 billion worth of textiles last year, negotiates a raft of global trade deals to slash tariffs. Ath Thon said an alliance of union activists was also lending support for Wednesday’s campaign in numerous capital cities by delivering petitions to Cambodian embassies and high street stores selling garments made in Cambodia. IndustriALL, which represents 50 million workers in 140 countries, said campaign activities had taken place in Australia, Belgium and Switzerland. “They understand that Cambodia’s garment sector has victimized many workers and when they couldn’t receive the basic wage, they protested and got killed,” Ath Thon said, adding that 400,000 Cambodian textile workers participated in the campaign. The long-running dispute over pay looked to have been settled prior to last year’s election, when the Garment Manufacturers Association in Cambodia agreed to gradually raise the minimum wage to $160 by 2018. But things changed when the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) made an election campaign pledge to raise the figure further. CNRP won support from textile unions during its months of street protests to demand a re-run of a July 2013 poll it said was rigged by the ruling party.  CNRP struck a deal with the Cambodian People’s Party two months ago to end its year-long parliamentary boycott and a fragile truce remains, although it is unclear whether CNRP is backing the latest wage campaign.

307,NKE,"European demand, higher margins drive Nike's profit beat","(Reuters) - Nike Inc (NKE.N), the world’s largest sportswear maker, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit as it gains market share in Europe and focuses on higher-margin products such as Flyknit soccer boots. The company’s shares rose 6.5 percent in extended trading, Nike said orders for its branded shoes and clothing scheduled for delivery between September and January rose 14 percent in the first quarter, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations.  The company has been giving tough competition to Germany’s Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE), which in July cut its revenue and profit targets for this year.  “When you look around the world, there really isn’t much competition. Adidas is struggling, Reebok is struggling,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough told Reuters. Nike maintained its share of the Western Europe sportswear market at about 12 percent in 2013, while Adidas’s share shrank to 12.6 percent in the year from 13.2 percent in 2012, according to Euromonitor International data. The soccer World Cup in Brazil in June-July was the first time that Nike sponsored more national teams than Adidas. More players wore Nike boots than all other brands combined and nearly a third of those players wore Flyknit boots. Global soccer revenue rose at a double-digit percentage rate in the first quarter, Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards said on a post-earnings conference call on Thursday. “As of the end of the quarter, we had the leading footwear market share in the nine largest football markets around the world,” he said. The company said it expects earnings per share to rise at a high teens percentage rate for the second quarter and about 20 percent for the year. Nike also said it expects gross margin expansion of about 125 basis points for the full year. The company said gross margin improved to 46.6 percent in the first quarter from 44.9 percent a year earlier.  The company said it reported an 18 percent rise in footwear, its largest and most profitable business. “There is tremendous energy around the brand in Europe with innovative products that are resonating with consumers. We saw strong results from both performance footwear and apparel as well as in sportswear,” Edwards said. Revenue from North America rose 12 percent in the quarter ended Aug. 31, while revenue from Western Europe jumped 25 percent, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations.     Revenue from emerging markets rose 10 percent in the quarter. Net income rose to $962 million, or $1.09 per share, in the first quarter from $779 million, or 86 cents per share, a year earlier.  The rise in net income was also helped by lower tax rate. Revenue jumped to $7.98 billion from $6.97 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 88 cents per share, on revenue of $7.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.         Shares of the company have gained more than 15 percent in one year to Thursday’s close of $79.75 on the New York Stock.

308,NKE,"UPDATE 2-European demand, higher margins drive Nike's profit beat","(Adds forecast, comments from analyst, executive; updates shares)  (Adds byline) By Devika  Krishna Kumar Sept 25 (Reuters) - Nike Inc, the world’s largest sportswear maker, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit as it gains market share in Europe and focuses on higher-margin products such as Flyknit soccer boots. The company’s shares rose 6.5 percent in extended trading, Nike said orders for its branded shoes and clothing scheduled for delivery between September and January rose 14 percent in the first quarter, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations. The company has been giving tough competition to Germany’s Adidas AG, which in July cut its revenue and profit targets for this year. “When you look around the world, there really isn’t much competition. Adidas is struggling, Reebok is struggling,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough told Reuters. Nike maintained its share of the Western Europe sportswear market at about 12 percent in 2013, while Adidas’s share shrank to 12.6 percent in the year from 13.2 percent in 2012, according to Euromonitor International data.

311,NKE,Nike shares spike as profit beats estimates,"(Reuters) - Nike Inc’s (NKE.N) shares rose as much as 11 percent to a record high after the world’s largest sportswear maker reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, prompting at least 13 brokerages to raise their price targets on its stock. The stock was the biggest contributor to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index's .DJI rise of 0.45 percent at midday. The brokerages raised their price targets on the stock to as much as $110. The median price target on it is $93.00, according to Thomson Reuters data. “Nike’s ability to refresh the pipeline, coupled with improving distribution/digital, continues to support pricing power and global market share gains even in perceived mature markets,” Janney Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. They raised their rating on the stock to “buy” from “neutral”.

Rival Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE) in July cut its revenue and profit targets for the year, blaming a plunge in sales at its golf business and its exposure to a weak Russian market.

After an initial move higher, shares were trading down 1.2 percent at $9.68, though the company reported a much smaller-than-expected quarterly loss. Volume of over 650,000 made the stock the most actively traded on the Nasdaq before the opening bell and represented over 4 percent of its 10-day average. On the New York Stock Exchange, Nike shares were surging, up 7.41 percent to $85.66, after the world’s largest sportswear maker reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Should the gains hold throughout the session, it would mark the best day for the stock since March 2013. Volume of nearly 170,000 shares placed the stock second on the most actives list on the New York Stock Exchange and represented nearly 4 percent of its 10-day average. U.S. stock index futures were inching higher on Friday after major indexes suffered their biggest drop since July and ahead of data on economic growth and consumer optimism. Major indexes saw their biggest declines since July 31 on Thursday in a broad sell off, with the S&P; 500 falling through a key technical support level, as Apple slumped and the dollar hit a four-year high. The S&P; has dropped for four of the past five sessions and closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since Aug 15. That level had previously served as support, and a protracted period underneath it could signal further losses. Economic data due includes a final reading of gross domestic product growth in the second quarter at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT). Expectations call for expansion of 4.6 percent versus the prior reading of 4.2 percent.

315,NKE,INSIGHT-Adidas fights to draw top talent to HQ in sleepy Bavarian town,"* Hard to attract designers to rural Germany * Adidas to open creative centre in Brooklyn * Nike based in fashionable Portland, now global footwear hub By Emma Thomasson HERZOGENAURACH, Germany, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Adidas  needs world-class designers, brand experts and technical whizzkids to improve its image against U.S. rival Nike , but persuading them to move to its headquarters in rural Germany is difficult. Adidas has been losing market share to the world’s biggest sportswear brand Nike, which is seen as far cooler in consumer surveys and is based near the hip U.S. city of Portland, Oregon. Adidas acknowledges it is hard to recruit at its headquarters near the Bavarian town of Herzogenaurach, particularly for design, marketing and digital roles, and admits it missed trends in the U.S. market, where Under Armour  has just overtaken it as No. 2 behind Nike. Nike’s better than expected earnings on Sept. 25 underscored its ascendancy. Adidas is responding by locating some key design roles in the United States at the same time as investing heavily in new facilities at its home base near the historic Bavarian town where Adidas was founded by shoe maker Adi Dassler in 1949. “We need a lot of that top talent that is cutting edge. Ideally, they are working in the tech industry, in marketing organisations or are coming from top competitors. We need an environment that appeals to them,” said Steve Fogarty, who is responsible for employer branding and digital recruiting “Designers tend to gravitate to very large, international cities like Berlin, Amsterdam, London and it is a bit harder to convince them to move to the centre of Germany.” Eric Liedtke, the American who took over as Adidas head of global brands in March, has promoted Paul Gaudio to the role of global creative director and moved him from Herzo to the firm’s U.S. base in Portland in a bid to turn around its fortunes in the world’s biggest market for sporting goods. Close to 1,000 Adidas staff are based in Portland, compared with Nike’s 8,500-strong workforce in the area. Gaudio announced on Wednesday that Adidas will open a small creative studio in New York’s Brooklyn district in 2015 to be led by three young footwear designers he has poached from Nike with a mission to explore design direction for the brand. That will complement existing creative centres in Shanghai, Tokyo and Rio, but the vast majority of the company’s hundreds of designers for football, outdoor, Originals fashion, training and running products remain based in Herzo. Adidas shares are down more than a third this year, most recently suffering from a third profit warning in a year in July that the firm blamed in part on a disappointing performance in North America, particularly from its golf business. Adidas trades at 17 times expected earnings, at a discount to Nike’s 22.5 times and fast-growing Under Armour’s 58 times. Despite the new designers in the United States, long-serving Adidas Chief Executive Herbert Hainer, himself a native of Bavaria, remains committed to the company’s base in a region proud of its strong economy and companies including BMW, Siemens, Audi, Munich Re and Allianz. About 3,900 of the total Adidas staff of 52,500 work in and around Herzo, about a third of them from outside Germany, and Hainer said last month the company planned to add 100-150 new staff at its headquarters every year. While Bavaria has a reputation for beer festivals, lederhosen and conservative politics, Nike’s home town of Portland is a city of 600,000 that prides itself on its liberal values and environmental awareness, as well as a proliferation of trendy eateries and microbreweries. Based on a campus in Beaverton, seven miles (11 km) outside Portland, Nike’s location in the American northwest also raised questions in its early days in the 1960s, with founder and Oregon native Phil Knight saying everybody originally thought it should be located in New England or the South. But Portland has since become a magnet for the global footwear industry, helped by the relatively short hop to Asian production hubs and a youthful talent pool, prompting Adidas to move its North America headquarters there from New Jersey in 1993, and drawing U.S. brands like Columbia Sportwear and Keen. Herzo, by contrast, is a town of just 24,000 people set in rolling fields, though many Adidas staff commute from the nearby university town of Erlangen or the city of Nuremberg, known for its walled old town, gingerbread and sausages but not for the most vibrant nightlife or fashion scene. Nuremberg has an airport with direct flights to many cities in Europe but not further afield and there is no train link to Herzo from Nuremberg or Erlangen, meaning most staff have to commute by car. Herzo’s biggest employer is family-owned Schaeffler, which has 9,000 staff in the town, mostly in technical roles producing precision products for the auto and aerospace industry. It is also home to rival sportswear firm Puma. Conscious that it was not the best location for a big global consumer brand, Adidas considered leaving Herzo in the 1990s when the company was trying to rebuild its fortunes after flirting with bankruptcy following the death of founder Dassler in 1978 and then his son Horst in 1987. But when the departure of U.S. troops from Germany at the end of the Cold War freed up the military base outside Herzo, local authorities persuaded Adidas to stay. It moved its headquarters to the base in 1998 from an overcrowded office in downtown Herzo and has been expanding the campus ever since. Herzogenaurach mayor German Hacker said surveys showed that foreign inhabitants particularly value the high quality of life and security that the town offers. “Herzogenaurach is a sheltered and manageable town. That is its charm, but you can get to big towns in 10-15 minutes if you want,” he said. One former employee, who declined to be named because they still work on a contract basis for Adidas, said they left the company because they found living in Bavaria too boring. “It is so odd that this company is in the middle of farmland. It doesn’t have anything to do with style,” the person said. Adidas recruiting expert Fogarty, who spent three years working in Herzo but moved back to Portland last year, says the vast majority of staff describe working in Germany as an amazing experience once they arrive. He set up a website to extol the virtues of Herzo, featuring employees from around the world praising the rural running tracks near the office, local beer festivals and the proximity to Alpine ski slopes. (herzo.adidas-group.com/) Fogarty, who often has to get up at the crack of dawn in Portland to speak to colleagues nine hours ahead in Herzo, said Adidas does not lose staff due to the location of its base as it is flexible about where people work. “While our headquarters is technically in Herzo, the opportunity to work in many locations is already here, so why invest in moving the headquarters?” he said. However, the experience of Puma, founded by Adi Dassler’s brother Rudolf after the two split a joint business, shows the pitfalls of dispersing key staff. Puma had based its product management and design team for its lifestyle range in London to be closer to fashion trends, but decided last year to move the division to Herzo as it sought to centralise functions as part of a restructuring programme. Puma is in the process of trying to reaffirm its sporting roots after sales tumbled in recent years. Puma had lost its reputation for sports performance gear by moving too far into the fashion business. Despite investing in fashion brands like NEO and Originals, Adidas has so far stayed true to its sporting heritage. Adidas recently announced plans to build two new buildings - with a capacity for 3,600 staff - at its “World of Sports” campus outside Herzo and is about to open a 16-metre-high climbing wall in the grounds. The Adidas campus already features sports fields and stylish buildings including a futuristic low-rise “brand centre” clad in black glass that opened in 2006 and a marketing and operations office called “Laces” that opened in 2011 and features criss-crossing walkways above a light-filled atrium. “You can work in a dull office in the middle of Munich or an awesome office two hours north of Munich,” said Christian Dzieia, Adidas director of property development. An on-site fitness centre with daily yoga and aerobics classes opened last year as well as a bilingual kindergarten for 110 children and a campus canteen revamped with input from German celebrity chef Holger Stromberg. “We’re hiring a lot of people with a huge passion for sport whose eyes light up when they walk around the campus,” said Fogarty. “You have the best of both worlds, where you can walk onto this international campus with a lot of high-tech facilities and then go have lunch in a thousand-year-old Bavarian village.” ",9282014,http://www.reuters.com/article/adidas-germany/insight-adidas-fights-to-draw-top-talent-to-hq-in-sleepy-bavarian-town-idUSL6N0RN0UK20140928

An on-site fitness center with daily yoga and aerobics classes opened last year as well as a bilingual kindergarten for 110 children and a campus canteen revamped with input from German celebrity chef Holger Stromberg.  “We’re hiring a lot of people with a huge passion for sport whose eyes light up when they walk around the campus,” said Fogarty. “You have the best of both worlds, where you can walk onto this international campus with a lot of high-tech facilities and then go have lunch in a thousand-year-old Bavarian village.” ",9292014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-adidas-germany-insight/adidas-fights-to-draw-top-talent-to-hq-in-sleepy-bavarian-town-idUSKCN0HN0AN20140929
317,NKE,UPDATE 2-Adidas seeks to placate investors with share buyback,"* Share buy back to start in Q4, run to end 2017 * Adidas says won’t cut investment * Shares down a third this year as Nike gains ground   (Adds spokesman, shareholder comment, background) By Emma Thomasson PARIS, Oct 1 (Reuters) - German sportswear maker Adidas , facing investor discontent after a series of profit warnings, plans to return  as much as 1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion) to shareholders over the next three years. The shareholder return programme would be financed mainly from the group’s free cash flow, with buybacks to start in the current quarter and be completed by the end of 2017, Adidas said in a statement on Wednesday. The buybacks would not come at the expense of a planned hike in investment in marketing, an Adidas spokesman added. The company, struggling to keep pace with larger U.S. rival Nike in the sportswear market, issued its third profit warning in a year in July, blaming a plunge in sales at its golf business and exposure to a weak Russian market. “This is just a sop for beleaguered shareholders, but does not solve the operational problems at Adidas. Top management seems to be under enormous pressure,” said Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment which is the ninth-biggest investor in Adidas with a 1.2 percent stake. Chief Executive Herbert Hainer said in August that Adidas had no plans for a share buyback. Adidas shares, which are down more than a third this year, traded 1.9 percent higher by 0918 GMT, outperforming Germany’s blue-chip index, which was 0.2 percent higher. “Given our group’s strong projected cash flow generation and healthy balance sheet, we have the necessary funding for both reinvestments for growth as well as cash returns to shareholders,” a company spokesman said in an emailed comment. Adidas has said it would increase spending on marketing and invest more in its own stores, although it is scaling back expansion plans in Russia due to higher risks to consumer sentiment and spending over the Ukraine crisis. While Nike has encroached on Adidas’s home territory in western Europe, the German firm has failed to make serious inroads in North America. Its U.S. rival extended its lead to take a 15 percent global market share in 2013 compared with 10.8 percent for Adidas, according to Euromonitor. Last month, Germany’s manager magazin said hedge funds including Knight Vinke, Third Point and TCI were considering buying stakes in Adidas to pressure management to make sweeping changes, although one of the funds dismissed this. The magazine said the funds would seek radical changes at Adidas, including the removal of CEO Hainer and the possible spin off of fitness brand Reebok and golf label TaylorMade. Hainer had his contract extended until 2017 earlier this year to allow the company to work on a succession plan. He has recently overhauled top management, appointing Roland Auschel and Eric Liedtke as new heads of global sales and global brands. Adidas said the buybacks were in addition to the company’s policy of paying out 20-40 percent of its net income as a dividend to shareholders . Adidas also said it would issue two Eurobonds with a total volume of up to 1 billion euros - with a seven and 12 year term - saying it would use the proceeds to pay down debt and to prefund future debt maturities, pension payments and returns to shareholders.

318,NKE,Adidas beefs up management as it seeks to revive fortunes,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German sportswear firm Adidas (ADSGn.DE) has appointed two new senior managers as part of an ongoing overhaul of its top leadership aimed at making the firm quicker to respond to consumer trends to keep up with bigger rival Nike (NKE.N). Adidas said Karen Parkin, a 49-year-old British national, would take over as chief human resources officer from Nov. 1, reporting directly to Chief Executive Herbert Hainer. Parkin joined Adidas in 1997 and has been in charge of the company’s global supply chain since 2013 after nine years working in North America. She replaces Matthias Malessa, who left the company at the end of July. Adidas said Jan Brecht, a 42-year-old who joined Adidas from German carmaker Daimler in 2009, would add Parkin’s supply chain function to his current role as chief information officer, and report in future to Glenn Bennett, the executive board member responsible for global operations. Adidas, accused of being too slow to react to fast-changing fashion and sport trends, said it hoped that bringing together the supply chain and information technology functions will help simplify and accelerate processes.  “The sporting goods and lifestyle market is in permanent flux. Speed will be a significant advantage which ensures that the group’s products reach consumers faster,” Adidas said in a statement. Hainer, facing investor discontent after a series of profit warnings, has overhauled top management in the last year, appointing Eric Liedtke as global head of brands, Roland Auschel as head of global sales and Mark King as new head of the struggling North America business. Those three leaders have been working with Hainer on a new strategic plan expected early next year and restructuring their own teams, naming 11 new direct reports in recent months. Hainer, who has been CEO since 2001, had his contract extended until 2017 earlier this year to allow the company to work on a succession plan, but some investors believe a change at the top should come sooner than that.

319,NKE,"Adidas shares jump as Russia, golf units cut stock surplus","BERLIN (Reuters) - German sportswear firm Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE), struggling to keep pace with larger U.S. rival Nike (NKE.N), reported progress on Thursday at clearing a backlog of stock as sales recovered in key markets, helping its shares rise strongly. Adidas, whose long-serving Chief Executive Herbert Hainer is under pressure after a series of profit warnings, confirmed its sales and profit forecasts for 2014 after reporting third-quarter results at the upper end of analyst expectations. Hainer said he had been aggressively addressing the group’s key challenges — restructuring its golf business, scaling back expansion in Russia and seeking to revive momentum in the U.S. market, adding he will present a new strategic plan in March. Third-quarter sales growth in western Europe accelerated to 10 percent from a currency-neutral 6 percent in the first half. The group slowed its decline in North America as growth of the core Adidas brand helped compensate for slumping golf sales. Adidas is the kit supplier to Germany’s world champion soccer team but has been losing market share to Nike which has been better a creating a buzz with its brand among fashion and sports-mad youngsters.  Equinet analyst Ingbert Faust said the improvement in Europe was encouraging given that Nike had reported strong growth in the region, raising fears of major pressure on Adidas in its home region. “Around 12 percent growth in sales of brand Adidas is not too much short of the around 15 percent growth at Nike in the last quarter,” said Faust, who rates Adidas as “buy”. Adidas cut inventory growth to 7 percent at the end of September on a currency-neutral basis from 16 percent at the end of June, as it cleared stock, particularly in Russia, where flagging consumer confidence has forced it to mark down goods. Adidas shares, down around 39 percent this year, were up 3.3 percent at 1145 GMT (6.45 a.m. EST), compared with a 0.2 percent rise for the  German blue-chip index .GDAXI. Adidas shares trade at 16.5 times forward earnings, a discount to 24.4 times for Nike. Hainer told a conference call for journalists that Adidas wanted to trim inventories by a rate of more than 10 percent in 2014 and to continue reducing absolute levels next year. Markdowns to clear stock in Russia and the golf unit weighed on the gross margin in the quarter, which fell to 47.4 percent, prompting Adidas to trim its gross margin target for the full year to 48-48.5 percent from 48.5-49 percent.  By contrast, Nike’s gross margin grew to 46.6 percent in the quarter to Aug. 31 from 44.9 percent the previous three months as the company focused on higher-margin products like Flyknit soccer boots even as it spent heavily on World Cup marketing.  To reduce its exposure to the weak rouble, Adidas, which runs more than 1,100 stores in Russia, will cut the number of net new stores it plans there to around 30 per year in 2014 and 2015, from an already reduced target of 80 per year. Hainer said Adidas was making progress in turning around its struggling golf business, cutting 15 percent of staff. He said sales and margins at the unit should stabilize and grow in 2015. Adidas said it expects sales to rise at a mid single-digit rate in 2015, while net income should grow at a higher rate than group sales. Adidas sales are traditionally slower in years with no major sporting events like the World Cup or Olympics. Adidas reported a 13 percent fall in third quarter operating profit to 405 million euros ($507 million) on sales up 6 percent to 4.118 billion, slightly ahead of average analyst forecasts for 399 million and 4 billion, respectively.  Adidas also gave more details of a 1.5 billion euro share buyback plan it announced last month, seen as an attempt to placate investors and fend off moves by activist funds. It will launch a first tranche on Friday of up to 300 million euros. But Hainer declined to comment on reports that an investor group that includes Jynwel Capital and funds affiliated with the Abu Dhabi government plan a $2.2 billion bid to buy Reebok, the fitness brand Adidas acquired in 2006.

321,NKE,"Rising stars make Adidas more American, less soccer-mad","HERZOGENAURACH Germany (Reuters) - A new generation of more international Adidas executives is trying to loosen a hierarchical structure that has held back creativity at the venerable German sports brand as it tries to retaliate against Nike (NKE.N). But that is a tall order for a company of 52,500 employees still based in the small Bavarian town where it was founded in 1949, now struggling to keep pace with the fast-changing whims of the urban teens who are its target clientele  “The whole organization is run so Germanically and is not fast and agile where everybody is empowered,” said Erich Joachimsthaler, head of strategy consultants Vivendi Partners. As disappointing performance, particularly in the U.S. market, has hammered the share price of late, long-serving Chief Executive Herbert Hainer, 60, has promoted a raft of younger managers ahead of his own expected retirement in 2017. Leading the new guard are 47-year-old American Eric Liedtke, global brand chief since March, and Roland Auschel, the 51-year-old German named as sales chief a year ago. Forced to ditch ambitious targets set for 2015, Liedtke and Auschel are working with Hainer on a new five-year strategy to be presented in March, but they are taking action already. Adidas and smaller sportswear rival Puma are still based in sleepy Herzogenaurach, Germany, where they were founded by two brothers who fell out with each other after World War Two. Liedtke has moved several executives to the firm’s U.S. base in trendy Portland, home to Nike, as he seeks to reverse the brand’s decline in the world’s top sportswear market, important not only for sales but also for defining global cool. Despite buying U.S. brand Reebok in 2006, the German firm that is strongest in soccer has struggled to break into sports like basketball and American football, recently slipping into third place in the United States behind Nike and fast-growing Under Armour, founded only in 1996. Its distance from the U.S. market and top-down structure have contributed to missing trends pioneered by Nike like its “FuelBand” fitness device and “Free” barefoot-feel running shoes, as well as being slow to catch on to the “Athleisure” trend that has seen sports leggings becoming the new denim. Liedtke, a former American football player who joined Adidas in 1994, has therefore revived the role of global creative director, and appointed Paul Gaudio to the post in Portland. Gaudio also plans a creative studio in Brooklyn to be led by three former Nike designers. America has long been an obsession for the Herzogenaurach sportswear firms. “The American market is about cool things that work. It’s a blend of sports and lifestyle, sports products that also have a street appeal and that is what we also see developing into Europe,” said Bjorn Gulden, a former Adidas executive now trying to revive Puma as CEO. Liedtke and Auschel have named 12 new direct reports in recent months, including Mark King as new North America head - the first American in the job for a decade. American, British and French executives now far outnumber Germans in their teams. More products for the U.S. market will be developed in Portland in the future, while Adidas has signed top basketball players and celebrities like Kanye West and Pharrell Williams.   Even when Adidas is ahead with an innovation like the “Boost” cushioned shoes that Liedtke helped develop in his previous role, it has not done enough to follow through with Nike-beating marketing, a failing it is now addressing.   Liedkte and Auschel have also shifted reporting lines to foster cooperation between the different parts of the business, for example encouraging the Originals fashion line to seek inspiration from the basketball division. To speed up decision making, heads of categories like running, soccer and basketball have also been put in charge of their own marketing and future product innovation.   Hainer said the new structure would be “more consumer-focused, brand-driven and agile” with clearer accountability. Though there are now more non-Germans, women and non-soccer players in the top ranks than before, Adidas watchers are sceptical of fundamental culture change as long as Hainer - CEO since 2001 - is still at the helm. Germany’s Manager Magazin reported in September that hedge funds were considering buying stakes in Adidas to push for sweeping changes, including a Reebok sale and Hainer’s removal, but few current shareholders have spoken out against the CEO.  Adidas declines to comment on reports that an investor group plans a $2.2 billion bid to buy Reebok.   Joachimsthaler, who has consulted for Adidas for years but is currently working with Nike, knows Liedtke well but doubts he will depart radically from the course set by Hainer. “Even under Eric Liedke, I have not seen that openness to experimentation, to tap into the Zeitgeist,” he said, adding that Adidas’s traditional structure had slowed it down when he was trying to help it catch up with the Nike Plus running app. While Nike works with many outside agencies, Adidas prefers to develop ideas in-house, Joachimsthaler said, adding that Nike executives have more autonomy than at hierarchical Adidas.  “You need somebody external for a radical strategy shift,” said one fund manager who holds Adidas shares and declined to be identified.

325,NKE,Nike accuses former shoe designers of taking secrets to Adidas,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nike Inc is accusing three of its former senior shoe designers of stealing its commercial secrets and making off for German rival Adidas AG, which announced in September the trio would staff its new urban footwear design studio in Brooklyn. A lawsuit filed in Oregon where Nike is headquartered claims at least $10 million in damages. The world’s largest sportswear maker said the former designers, Marc Dolce, Mark Miner, and senior design director Denis Dekovic, started consulting for Adidas while still working at the company, violating their non-compete agreements. Nike said the designers hatched their plan last April, and pitched Adidas on a design studio that would help craft products while also bringing Adidas information about Nike’s plans for the next few years in its running, sportswear and soccer lines. The plans for the studio were essentially for a knockoff of Nike’s own design lab, called the Kitchen, according to the complaint. Adidas bought the studio idea and offered the designers lucrative employment contracts, Nike said. The project, called the Brooklyn Creative Design Studio, is set to open early next year. An Adidas representative said the company attracts top talent and has “no interest in old work or past assignments.” Nike’s spokesman declined to comment further on the case, but said the company will “vigorously” protect its intellectual property. Before leaving Nike, the complaint alleged, the designers copied sensitive design and business documents from their computers, including drawings for an unreleased shoe made for one of Nike’s sponsored athletes. The suit accused the designers of trying to hide their tracks by erasing incriminating emails and text messages from their work-issued cellphones and laptops. Nike also claimed that Adidas knew of the non-compete agreements and promised to pay for any legal fallout. The agreements barred the designers from any connection with Adidas during their employment and for one year after.

327,NKE,Nike accuses former shoe designers of taking secrets to Adidas,"NEW YORK, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Nike Inc is accusing three of its former senior shoe designers of stealing its commercial secrets and making off for German rival Adidas AG , which announced in September the trio would staff its new urban footwear design studio in Brooklyn. A lawsuit filed in Oregon where Nike is headquartered claims at least $10 million in damages. The world’s largest sportswear maker said the former designers, Marc Dolce, Mark Miner, and senior design director Denis Dekovic, started consulting for Adidas while still working at the company, violating their non-compete agreements. Nike said the designers hatched their plan last April, and pitched Adidas on a design studio that would help craft products while also bringing Adidas information about Nike’s plans for the next few years in its running, sportswear and soccer lines. The plans for the studio were essentially for a knockoff of Nike’s own design lab, called the Kitchen, according to the complaint. Adidas bought the studio idea and offered the designers lucrative employment contracts, Nike said. The project, called the Brooklyn Creative Design Studio, is set to open early next year. An Adidas representative said the company attracts top talent and has “no interest in old work or past assignments.” Nike’s spokesman declined to comment further on the case, but said the company will “vigorously” protect its intellectual property. Before leaving Nike, the complaint alleged, the designers copied sensitive design and business documents from their computers, including drawings for an unreleased shoe made for one of Nike’s sponsored athletes. The suit accused the designers of trying to hide their tracks by erasing incriminating emails and text messages from their work-issued cellphones and laptops. Nike also claimed that Adidas knew of the non-compete agreements and promised to pay for any legal fallout. The agreements barred the designers from any connection with Adidas during their employment and for one year after.

328,NKE,"A selfie on your shoes? Personalised gifts for ""Millennials""","* “Millennial” generation keen on self-expression * Mars, Coca-Cola, Nike, Adidas offer personalised products * Co-creation trend spreads as technology advances * Personalisation helps retailers draw shoppers to stores By Emma Thomasson BERLIN, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Looking for a unique Christmas gift to wow friends or family? Try some specially tailored perfume, chocolates stamped with a personal message or sneakers embossed with a selfie. Products with that individual twist are not really new. It has long been possible to get a basic T-shirt, baseball cap or umbrella printed with a name or photo. But big consumer brands, including major names like Coca-Cola, and Nike have latched on to personalised products because they seem to have a particular appeal to consumers known as “Millennials” in marketing speak. Used to posting selfie mobile phone shots on social media, this generation, who came of age from around 2000, wants something more than just the latest hot brand name. Millennials still like brands but expect them to listen and react to their ideas and criticism in real time and allow them a role in shaping future products. They have become a big focus of marketing experts as their spending power grows. “They’re drawn to brands who are rethinking the way things are done. They want to be heard,” Maryleigh Bliss, trends editor at youth marketing firm Ypulse, told the World Retail Congress earlier this year. Early to respond was Mars Inc, which prints tiny personal messages and photos on M&Ms; chocolates, and Coca-Cola which scored a hit by putting people’s names on its bottles, selling more than 150 million. “It was a crazy idea but ... it really connected because it has all the characteristics that appeal to Millennials,” Coca-Cola chief marketing officer Joe Tripodi said. “It was customisable, it was social.” Coca-Cola has gone a step further to produce its first fully user-generated commercial, including shaky videos showing its fans enjoying a Coke. It has also come up with the Freestyle machine which allows people to mix their own soft drink. The “co-creation” fad is spreading to more complex products and processes as technology brings down costs. U.S. sportswear firm Nike allows people to customise colours of shoes and accessories. German rival Adidas has tapped into the selfie obsession by offering shoppers the option to put personal images on the uppers of ZX Flux sneakers. While Adidas customers currently have to wait three to four weeks for the delivery of “selfie shoes,” the proliferation of technology like 3-D printing means it might not be long before personalised products can be made on the spot in a store. Ben Perkins, a consumer expert at consultants Deloitte, said brands and retailers have to act fast to keep up with rising expectations for more personalisation. “As speeds improve, this kind of real-time product design, development and manufacture is going to be increasingly scaled,” he said. “Don’t look at your customer base today but look at them tomorrow and think about how you need to embed these approaches and technologies ... in your organisation now.” Retailers trying to cope with the growth of online shopping are also looking at co-creation as a way to attract consumers back into their stores. British department store Selfridges and Swiss fragrance maker Givaudan created a “lab” installation where shoppers can develop a perfume, bottle shape and label tailored to their personality. Australian online start-up Shoes of Prey allows customers to choose from 170 different fabrics to design their own shoes. It launched studios in six branches of upscale U.S. department store chain Nordstrom last month. Shoes of Prey delivers within four weeks but is working towards a two-week turnaround. Chief Executive Michael Fox said that the business model was more profitable and involved less waste as there was no need to discount excess stock. “Customers are looking to participate in the design process to get exactly what they want. Together we see customisation and manufacturing on demand as the future of retail,” Fox said.       (Reporting by Emma Thomasson.

331,NKE,"UPDATE 1-Nike flags slowing growth in western Europe, emerging markets","(Adds details, updates shares) Dec 18 (Reuters) - Nike Inc’s futures orders rose at its slowest pace in four quarters, indicating weakening demand for the sportswear maker’s products in emerging markets and western Europe. Shares of the company, which reported better-than-expected second-quarter results, fell 3.17 percent in extended trading. Expectations were extremely high after two quarters of “pretty big earnings beats”, but Nike beat by a few pennies, Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said, adding that the slowdown in futures orders could also be a cause for concern. Nike said global futures orders, an indicator of demand, at the end of the second quarter was 11 percent higher, excluding currency changes, than a year earlier. Analysts were expecting a 11.3 percent growth in orders for Nike-branded footwear and apparel for delivery from December through April, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. In western Europe, a major growth market for Nike, futures orders rose 13 percent, lower than the expected 15 percent. Orders growth in emerging markets - which includes Brazil, Mexico and the Asia-Pacific region other than Japan - was 1 percent, much lower than the 7 percent rise analysts expected. Order growth in western Europe and emerging markets, which together accounted for nearly a third of fiscal 2014 sales, was 20 percent and 9 percent respectively at the end of the first quarter. Nike’s said net income rose 23 percent to $655 million, or 74 cents, in second quarter ended Nov. 30. Revenue rose 15 percent to $7.38 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 70 cents per share, on revenue of $7.15 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Nike shares were trading at $94 after the bell.

The S&P; 500 index had climbed 4.5 percent over the previous two sessions, spurred by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s commitment to take a “patient” approach toward raising interest rates, while signaling it was on track to boost rates in 2015. That provided clarity and relief to investors over the policy outlook, analysts said. Brent crude oil advanced above $60 a barrel on Friday, recovering from near a 5-1/2-year low, while WTI crude  climbed 3.3 percent to $55.90. The benchmark stock index has risen more than 3 percent this week, putting the S&P; on track for its best weekly performance in two months. It has erased nearly all the losses from the prior week, which were spurred by a sharp drop in oil prices. Shares of Nike shed 2.8 percent, a day after the company flagged slowing growth in western Europe. At 1:16 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones industrial average  fell 12.64 points, or 0.07 percent, to 17,765.51, the S&P; 500  gained 2.58 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,063.81 and the Nasdaq Composite added 7.18 points, or 0.15 percent, to 4,755.57. Quadruple witching - the expiration of stock options, index options, index futures and single-stock futures - may add to the day’s volatility, along with the rebalancing of the S&P; 500, which is scheduled to take effect after the close. Shares of Red Hat surged 10.9 percent after it raised its profit forecast for the full year and reported quarterly revenue and profit that beat expectations.

Hainer, 60, in the job since 2001 and the longest-serving CEO of a German blue-chip company, wrote to staff confirming the move after Manager Magazin reported the world’s second-biggest sportswear group was looking for his successor. Hainer, whose contract was extended until 2017 last year with a mandate to work on a succession plan, said the search for a new CEO was a “long-term process” that would involve both internal and external candidates. He is due to launch a new long-term strategic plan on March 26 together with his two most likely successors, global brand chief Eric Liedtke and sales boss Roland Auschel. Hainer said he wants to get the plan off to a “great start”, without saying if he will see out his existing contract. Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment which has a 0.9 percent stake in Adidas, said the CEO should go as quickly as possible. “A new strategy will only be credible with a new leadership,” Speich, who has been Hainer’s most outspoken critic, told journalists in an email. “The sooner Mr Hainer hands the baton on to a successor, the better.” Manager Magazin said Hainer would target 20 billion euros  ($22.7 billion) of annual sales and an operating margin of at least 10 percent by 2020, up from 14.8 billion and 8.3 percent last year respectively. Nike is targeting revenue of $36 billion by fiscal 2017. Hainer said the plan would show the ambition of Adidas to be the best sports company in the world, but declined to give further details. He said Adidas had made a “fantastic start” to 2015 after he restructured the struggling golf business, sold the non-core Rockport brand and launched a big marketing drive, including campaigns with singers Pharrell Williams and Kanye West. Hainer started out as a sales manager for consumer goods firm Procter & Gamble, joining Adidas in 1987 and rising rapidly through the ranks to take over as CEO in 2001. Sales have more than doubled during his 14-year tenure, but those of Nike and other rivals have grown even faster as Adidas failed to crack the U.S. market despite buying the Reebok brand in 2006. It recently slipped into third place in the United States behind Nike and relative newcomer Under Armour. Hainer’s woes were compounded last year by a sudden slowdown in the golf market and the firm’s deep exposure to Russia, where the tumbling rouble has scaled back new store openings. A series of profit warnings prompted rumblings from shareholders, with hedge funds reported to be considering buying stakes in Adidas to force Hainer out. The company’s shares were up 3.4 percent by 1410 GMT on Thursday, making them the biggest gainer on the German blue-chip index DAX.

Investors, however, ignored the warning, sending its shares up 4.5 percent to $102.75 in heavy after-hours trading on Thursday. Orders for shoes and apparel scheduled for delivery from March through July 2015 at the end of the third quarter, a gauge of demand Nike calls “futures orders,” rose 11 percent globally, excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Analysts had expected a 9.9 percent rise. Futures orders growth would have been even higher if the results were not compared to the strong growth last year due to the soccer World Cup, Trevor Edwards, president of the Nike brand said on a post-earnings conference call. “This is another just rock solid quarter .. it is really impressive for a company of this size ... they are firing on all cylinders,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said, pointing to Nike’s forward orders beat, profit jump and gross margin expansion due to increased sales of high margin products. Sales of footwear, the company’s largest and most profitable business, rose 8 percent in the third quarter, while apparel sales rose 3 percent, Nike said. Demand for the company’s Jordan, LeBron, Kobe and KD basketball shoe brands have been strong in the United States. The company’s running shoe brands, including Free 5.0, Roshe Run, Huarache, and Max Air, have also been doing well. Nike said it expects current-quarter sales growth to be in the “low double-digits”, adjusting for currency fluctuations. When accounting for the stronger dollar, the growth is expected decrease by about eight to nine percentage points. The growing strength of the dollar will also hurt the company’s revenue, gross margin and profit next year, Chief Financial Officer Don Blair said on the call. Net income rose 16 percent to $791 million, or 89 cents per share in the third quarter ending Feb. 28. Gross margins expanded 1.4 percentage point to 45.9 percent.

348,NKE,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Decline in U.S. dollar lifts oil, stocks","* Euro set for best week in over two years * Wall St stocks rally; S&P; set for weekly gain * Oil sharply higher despite oversupply concerns * European stocks helped after Athens’ assurances   (Updates to afternoon trading, recasts lead and adds Nike results) By Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK, March 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell sharply on Friday and was on track for its biggest weekly decline against the euro in more than three years, helping to drive a rally in Wall Street stocks and crude oil. Riskier assets like equities were in general on track for a strong week, largely driven by the Federal Reserve’s policy statement on Wednesday, which struck a more dovish tone than investors had expected. The Fed appeared to argue against an interest rate hike in June. The dollar index is up more than 20 percent since mid-2014. The dollar’s strength for some time buoyed U.S. stocks because it served as evidence of a growing economy, but lately there have been concerns of the impact on profits of U.S. multinational companies. U.S. crude futures were on track for their first weekly advance of the past five, while the S&P; 500 was set to snap a three-week losing streak. The euro was on pace for its biggest weekly jump against the dollar in more than three years, while the U.S. dollar index was set for its biggest weekly drop since 2011. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell 1.7 percent, its biggest one-day decline since October 2011. The euro rose 1.87 percent to $1.0859 on Friday, while the yen rose 0.54 percent against the dollar. “This is just some counter-trend correction in the dollar and is transitory,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist, at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. European equities closed higher. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  posted its highest close since mid-2007, finishing up 0.8 percent at 1,610.93. Greek equities rose 2.9 percent after Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras assured European Union creditors his coalition would soon present economic reforms to unlock cash to stave off bankruptcy. In addition, the longer-term weakness of the euro was seen as boosting the region’s economy and corporate earnings. MSCI’s all-country world index of equity performance in 46 countries rose 1.54 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 226.52 points, or 1.26 percent, to 18,185.55, the S&P; 500 gained 24.13 points, or 1.15 percent, to 2,113.4, and the Nasdaq Composite  added 47.84 points, or 0.96 percent, to 5,040.22. Share of Nike Inc, a Dow component, jumped 5 percent, to $103.40, a day after the company reported strong quarterly results, though it warned about the impact of the dollar on the current quarter. “The reaction to Nike has been positive and the stock is up nicely. It has been a strong name, but currency is going to have an impact,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. The biotech index rose 0.5, powered by a 9.4 percent gain in Biogen Idec after the company announced promising results of an early-stage study of its drug to treat Alzheimer’s. The market may see heightened volatility heading into Friday’s close as a result of quadruple witching: the expiration of stock options, index options, index futures and single-stock futures. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 12/32 in price, pushing the yield down to 1.9303 percent. Brent crude rose 1 percent to $54.99 per barrel while U.S. crude futures for April delivery jumped 5 percent to $46.17. While concerns remain about oversupply, oil was boosted by the dollar’s decline. Both gold and silver rose for a third straight session, also helped by the dollar’s weakness.  Gold rose 1.2 percent while silver jumped 4.7 percent. Copper  rose 3.2 percent.

354,NKE,China's JD.com sets up cross-border e-commerce platform in challenge to Alibaba,"BEIJING, April 15 (Reuters) - JD.com Inc, China’s No. 2 e-commerce player, on Wednesday launched its JD Worldwide cross-border online shopping platform, a challenger to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s Tmall Global service. JD Worldwide will allow Chinese shoppers to buy imports from U.S. firms such as Nike Inc, Starbucks Corp and Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc, as well as products from countries like Australia, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, JD.com said in a press release. Overseas suppliers will provide more than 1,200 brands, without those merchants requiring a presence in China. The venture adds to a host of online retail rivals for Alibaba and Amazon.com Inc catering to fears about the quality and safety of Chinese goods after a number of scares, and comes on the back of a Chinese government push to promote e-commerce and relax import restrictions. But JD.com still trails far behind Alibaba in Chinese e-commerce. Alibaba’s high profile since its record-breaking $25 billion U.S. listing in September is a huge lure for brands looking to enter or raise their presence in China, which some analysts estimate as the world’s biggest online shopping market. “Imported goods have always been huge sellers on JD.com, and this massively expands the range of products available to Chinese consumers,” said Leo Li, who oversees JD Worldwide, in an e-mail to Reuters. Using China’s e-commerce free trade zones and the firm’s own logistics network, JD.com can “offer international brands a direct channel to Chinese consumers with preferential tax rates to make prices highly competitive,” he said, adding that JD.com would also do marketing for its overseas partners. “We are currently providing free advertising so that they get good traffic and don’t become ghost stores. We’re playing the long game with our partners.” JD.com, backed by Alibaba arch-rival Tencent Holdings Ltd , also said it launched with eBay Inc a programme to allow Chinese shoppers to buy select goods from U.S. eBay sellers. A spokeswoman for eBay confirmed the partnership. Shares of JD.com, which markets itself as a seller of authentic goods, have risen 44 percent since the beginning of the year. Alibaba’s stock price, on the other hand, has fallen 18 percent in the same period. Analysts have expressed concern over counterfeits on the world’s largest e-commerce firm’s platforms, as well as lacklustre earnings and investor excitement wearing off after the initial public offering.

355,NKE,Obama to push case for trade deal at Nike headquarters in Oregon,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will travel to Nike Inc (NKE.N) headquarters in Oregon next Friday to argue that a 12-nation Pacific trade deal and the fast-track legislation needed to finalize the pact are good for workers. Obama faces tough opposition from his fellow Democrats in Congress over the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, which they fear could hurt American jobs and the environment. He will use the trip to the headquarters of Nike, a company once criticized for its use of “sweatshops,” to “discuss how workers will benefit from progressive, high-standards trade agreements that would open up new markets and support high-quality jobs,” the White House said in a statement. Nike was targeted by labor activists in the early 1990s for contracting with factories in Asia where workers faced dangerous conditions and low pay. The criticism prompted the company to create a code of conduct for contractors and open factories for inspections. Obama has made the TPP a key part of his effort to rebalance his foreign policy to Asia to counter China’s economic might. He has argued that the deal would be the most “progressive” and transparent in history, with protections for labor and the environment.

358,NKE,UPDATE 3-Adidas begins marathon turnaround in North America,"* North America sales up currency-neutral 7 percent * CEO “very” optimistic for 2015 * Sales, net profit guidance for 2015 confirmed * Running, fashion report double-digit sales rise * Shares up 1.2 percent   (Adds details from conference call) By Emma Thomasson BERLIN, May 5 (Reuters) - German sportswear company Adidas  turned around its sales in North America in the first quarter, helped by a marketing campaign designed to win business from dominant rival Nike. Adidas said group sales rose 17 percent to 4.08 billion euros ($4.54 billion), or 9 percent excluding the impact of currencies, beating an average analyst forecast for 3.91 billion and lifting its shares more than 1 percent. Despite the hike in marketing spending, Adidas increased its operating margin by 10 basis points to 8.9 percent, still well behind the 13 percent achieved by Nike last year. Long-serving Chief Executive Herbert Hainer, who faced calls to quit last year as Adidas lost more ground to Nike, said the sales improvement was broad-based, with particularly strong growth in the running and fashion businesses. While western Europe and China grew fast, Hainer also highlighted a 7 percent currency-neutral rise in North American sales in the first three months of the year, which he said showed the initial success of splashy brand campaigns. “It is just the beginning. America is not a sprint for us, it is more a marathon... We still have a lot of work ahead of us,” Hainer told a conference call for journalists. The figures should help reassure investors ahead of the Adidas annual general meeting on Thursday, when Hainer is likely to face calls for clarity on his leadership after the board launched a formal search for a successor. Hainer, who has been CEO since 2001, said on Tuesday that turning the business around was more important than whether he stays on until the end of his contract in 2017. Hainer launched a new five-year strategy last month to lift sales by almost half to above 22 billion euros, focusing on speeding up the supply chain and achieving success in the United States and the world’s largest cities. Adidas shares, which have already risen almost a third this year on signs of improved performance, pared early gains to trade up 1.2 percent by 1105 GMT, outperforming a slightly weaker German blue-chip index. Adidas shares trade at 21 times forward earnings, still at a discount to Nike on almost 26 times. “Good start into 2015 as previously hinted. Full year sales growth forecast looks somewhat conservative, we reckon, given the around 9 percent growth in Q1 against a strong Q1 2014,” said Equinet analyst Ingbert Faust, who rates the stock “buy”. Adidas reiterated it expected 2015 sales to rise by a medium single-digit percentage rate on a currency-neutral basis, after a 6 percent increase in 2014, while net profit from continuing operations should climb 7-10 percent. Hainer said he was “very optimistic” about the outlook, but noted that Adidas faced tougher comparisons for the second and third quarter due to last year’s World Cup. Adidas slipped to third place in the United States last year behind Nike and fast-growing Under Armour, while Nike advanced in the German firm’s home territory of western Europe and in soccer, to take its global market share to 15.9 percent compared to 10.5 for Adidas, according to data firm Euromonitor. Adidas has responded by increasing marketing spending by more than a quarter and putting a new emphasis on the United States, the world’s top sportswear market, important not only for sales but also for setting global trends. Hainer appointed a new head of the North American business, poached key Nike designers and moved several executives to the Adidas U.S. base in Portland, as well as spending more on sponsorship in baseball, basketball and American football. Hainer has seen the group’s U.S. market share gradually decline despite buying American brand Reebok in 2006, prompting some investors to suggest he should sell it off again. But Hainer has rejected such calls, noting that Reebok, repositioned as a fitness brand, is now performing well, benefiting from the booming popularity of training. Reebok saw sales rise a currency-neutral 9 percent in the first quarter - an eighth consecutive quarter of growth - even though they fell 3 percent in North America due to closures of factory outlet stores as the brand seeks to shift more upmarket. Fashion brand Originals grew 29 percent, benefiting from the catwalk success of its relaunched “Superstar” sneakers supported by celebrities including pop star Pharrell Williams as well as its “Yeezy” shoe developed with Kanye West. Meanwhile, the running business recorded a sales increase of 13 percent, helped by the introduction of a new range of shoes with springy, lightweight “Boost” soles - worn by the winners of 32 recent marathons, including those in Berlin and New York.

359,NKE,Obama puts Nike in trade spotlight despite sweatshop stigma of past,"WASHINGTON, May 6 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will make a high-profile pitch for a Pacific trade deal he promises will protect workers on Friday at Nike Inc, a company once reviled for using Asian sweatshops to make its famous sneakers. In choosing the company’s Oregon headquarters as the backdrop for his message, Obama risks reminding people of global trade’s downside just when he needs to convince nervous Democrats to back the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a key plank of the administration’s strategic pivot to Asia. But appearing at Nike also allows Obama to talk about how things have changed from previous trade deals, and to associate his TPP with a company that says it has learned from the past mistakes of globalization. Obama calls the TPP “the most progressive trade agreement in our history,” but officials declined to say why he chose Nike to showcase a deal economists say will add $77.5 billion to U.S. annual economic output. Stories exposing low wages and abuse at Indonesian shoe factories supplying Nike surfaced in the early 1990s, eventually sparking consumer boycotts. In 1998, then-chief executive Phil Knight acknowledged that his product “has become synonymous with slave wages, forced overtime and arbitrary abuse” and pledged to raise standards. Nike required contractors to sign a code of conduct and hired auditors to monitor changes. Although the approach had little impact initially, conditions improved significantly after Nike began training and working more closely with suppliers, said Richard Locke of Brown University, who began studying the company in 2002. “They’re still being paid less than they would be paid here, because wage rates are lower in these countries,” said Locke, who has pored over Nike’s internal audit data. “But the actual working conditions - pace, cleanliness, healthiness - it’s like a modern factory anywhere.” Skeptics point to Nike’s past as vindication for their message about the TPP’s dangers. “They are the symbol of what everyone is afraid the future under TPP will be, which is a United States brand name, a handful of well-paid, high-income professional jobs ... and then production offshore to the lowest possible wage venues,” said Lori Wallach of consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Nike employs about 26,000 Americans, 8,000 in Oregon, where its shoes are designed. But they are produced by more than 1 million workers in nearly 700 contract factories, a third in TPP partner Vietnam, where unions say the minimum wage is $100-$140 a month. The pact would make importing those shoes cheaper. Obama making the case that the TPP paves the way to more sustainable U.S. jobs could give political cover to Democrats  braving union opposition to support legislation to speed deals like the TPP through Congress. Four of Oregon’s six Democratic members of Congress have signaled support for the bill, which is expected to be voted on by end-June. Nike said it is proud of its record in Oregon, where one in five jobs depend on trade and where it contributes $2.5 billion a year to the state economy, according to Hilary Krane, the company’s general counsel and chief administrative officer. “Our whole Oregon operation from the start has been built on international trade,” she said. Nike spokesman Greg Rossiter said the company had “fundamentally changed the way we do business” and improved conditions for workers in contract factories, although more work is still needed. For Nike, Obama’s visit allows it to align itself as part of the “solution” to the ills of globalization, said Peter LaMotte, senior vice president at crisis communications firm Levick. “While there will always be those who remember Nike for the child labor issues, the vast majority of the American public will associate them more with Air Jordans,” LaMotte said.

360,NKE,White House says will let Nike 'share their news' on Obama visit,"ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - The White House declined to say on Thursday whether Nike Inc would be making a company announcement to coincide with President Barack Obama’s visit to the company’s Oregon headquarters on Friday. The Los Angeles Times reported on Thursday that Nike “is likely to make its own manufacturing announcement” on Friday “around the time that Obama speaks at the Nike headquarters.” The newspaper did not provide a source for the assertion. Asked whether Nike would be making an announcement to coincide with Obama’s visit, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said: “I’m going to let Nike share their news when they’re available to do so.” Nike officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Obama is slated to make a major pitch on Friday for the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, at Nike, a venue that has sparked curiosity, since the company produces its famous sneakers in lower-cost contract factories in Asia. White House officials have declined to say why they chose to highlight the company among Oregon exporters. Obama’s push to pass “fast-track” trade legislation, which would enable him to finalize the TPP deal, faces resistance from fellow Democrats who worry it could push U.S. jobs overseas where labor is cheaper. The TPP would boost annual U.S. economic output by $77.5 billion, a tiny proportion of the $17 trillion economy. Obama has pledged the deal will include tough labor and environmental protections. Skeptical unions and environmental groups have organized protests outside Nike for Obama’s visit. Nike employs 26,000 people in the United States, but that number is dwarfed by the more than 1 million workers in 700 contract factories worldwide who manufacture its shoes. In 2012, Nike promised to create 500 jobs in Oregon for a $2 billion break from state taxes over 30 years. It said it added 2,084 jobs between January 2012 and September 2014. Nike’s image was tarnished by revelations of sweatshop conditions and abuse in the 1990s. It has worked to clean up its image, but problems remain. It was recently hit by a strike at a factory in Vietnam that is a contract manufacturer. There was a strike at one of its Chinese suppliers in March.

364,NKE,UPDATE 1-Adidas under fire from investors despite recovery signs,"* Investors criticise management at shareholder meeting * CEO says has hired advisers in case of activist attack * Portfolio manager sees too few innovations to beat Nike * Doubts over leadership as board seeks new CEO * CEO rejects call for sale of Reebok brand   (Adds details, quotes) By Emma Thomasson FUERTH, Germany, May 7 (Reuters) - Adidas  shareholders took aim at the management of the German sportswear company on Thursday, not convinced a new strategy would be enough to challenge the dominance of rival Nike. “Adidas is panting behind the competition. Adidas lost the race, at least in 2014,” Gerhard Jaeger, spokesman for the SdK investor association, told the firm’s annual shareholder meeting in the southern town of Fuerth. Long-serving Chief Executive Herbert Hainer, who faced calls to quit last year after Adidas was hit by falling golf sales and its heavy exposure to Russia, said the company was addressing problem areas and had made a good start to 2015. But he added the firm had hired advisers Perella Weinberg Partners in the event of a more concerted campaign for change from an activist shareholder group, in a sign management is braced for more turmoil. “It never feels good if you don’t reach all of your goals, neither in sport, nor in business, nor in your personal life. But the key thing is to never give up,” Hainer said. “We have taken our learnings from 2014 and developed an exciting and promising strategy for the period up until 2020.” While Adidas shares tumbled 38 percent last year, they have rebounded this year, though helped by a buyback which some shareholders view as money that would be better invested. Adidas reported better-than-expected first-quarter results on Tuesday as its struggling North America business showed signs of improvement after a big increase in marketing. Hainer launched a five-year strategy in March to lift sales by almost half to above 22 billion euros ($25 billion), focused on speeding up the supply chain and success in the United States and the world’s largest cities. However, Marco Scherer, portfolio manager for Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management which holds a 1.7 percent stake in Adidas, said the strategy lacked credibility as the board was looking for a new CEO ahead of Hainer’s contract expiring in 2017. “What is missing from Adidas, is a clear direction ... Which management should lead this strategy ultimately to success? When will a decision come?” Scherer asked. “Adidas responds to market conditions, but it seems to have  forgotten how to set decisive trends itself,” he added. “Where are the product innovations with which you want to take market share from Nike and Under Armour?” Hainer, 14 years in the job and the longest-serving CEO of a German blue-chip, said the new strategy was developed by the whole top management team and was being implemented as a team. Daniela Bergdolt, vice president of the Deutsche Schutzvereinigung fuer Wertpapierbesitz, Germany’s largest association for private investors, welcomed the new direction but said it would take time to bear fruit. She also called for Adidas to sell fitness brand Reebok, which it bought in 2006 but has failed to help Adidas grow its market share in the United States and is only now starting to recover after a long period of underperformance. Hainer, who was the architect of the Reebok acquisition,  said it would be wrong to sell the brand now it was growing again, especially given the booming popularity of fitness.

365,NKE,"Obama to Democrats on Asia trade pact: like Nike, 'just do it'","BEAVERTON, Oregon (Reuters) - President Barack Obama, co-opting Nike Inc’s famous slogan, told Democrats on Friday to “just do it” and support a trade deal with Asian countries that the shoe company said would help it create up to 10,000 U.S. jobs over 10 years. The setting - Nike’s headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon - was an unusual one for a presidential trade pitch.  Nike has long faced criticism for using Asian sweat shops to produce its pricey footwear. But the company has worked to improve conditions overseas and said on Friday it would also boost investment in U.S. manufacturing if the 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) pact is approved. Obama used that promise of new jobs to try to convince skeptical lawmakers from his own party to support TPP and join Republicans in granting him “fast-track” authority to finalize the deal.  Many Democrats are concerned the proposed pact would help companies move operations to cheaper offshore facilities.  “On trade, I actually think some of my dearest friends are wrong. They’re just wrong,” Obama said at Nike headquarters. “If we don’t write the rules for trade around the world, guess what: China will.” He added, “Just do it, everybody.” Before the trip, White House aides had been coy about why Obama chose such a controversial backdrop for his speech. An administration official said Nike had approached the White House about the trade deal and that led to Obama’s appearance there. Labor and environmental groups protested Obama’s appearance at Nike and said the company’s job-creating claims were vague.  “We have heard similar promises from companies before, and very few have panned out,” said Eric Hauser, a spokesman for the AFL-CIO, the nation’s largest labor coalition. Nike has 26,000 U.S. employees, but it counts on more than 1 million workers in contract factories worldwide to make its shoes, some of which sell for hundreds of dollars. A third of those factories are in Vietnam, a TPP participant. Almost all footwear sold in the United States is made overseas and is subject to import tariffs that average 25 percent to 35 percent, according to the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, a shoe dealer’s group. For shoes imported from TPP countries, notably Vietnam, U.S. firms paid $400 million in tariffs in 2014, the group said. Nike said relief from “antiquated” footwear tariffs in the TPP deal would allow it to invest more money at home. In addition to 10,000 U.S. manufacturing and engineering jobs, it promised as many as 40,000 additional jobs would pop up in its domestic supply chain if an agreement were reached. “Free trade opens doors. It removes barriers. It creates jobs,” Nike Chief Executive Mark Parker told the crowd ahead of Obama’s speech in Beaverton, seven miles from Portland. When asked, Nike offered few details on, for instance, whether it would build new plants, how soon new jobs could come on line, how much money workers might be paid, or what kind of shoes could be produced in the United States. A Nike spokesman said in an email that it was “too early for us to say specifically where we will invest, but it will be a significant investment over the next decade.” The White House declined to provide additional details, referring questions to Nike. In the past two years, Nike has ramped up its lobbying efforts as debate over the trade treaty has intensified. The company nearly tripled its lobbying spending to more than $1.1 million in 2014 from $400,000 in 2012, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington campaign finance and lobbying research group. Nike multibillionaire co-founder Philip Knight is Oregon’s richest person and leans Republican, though he has donated money over the years to both parties, including more than $85,000 to Republican congressional committees in 2013 and 2014, according to federal records analyzed by the center. Knight has also given money to Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, a key supporter along with Republicans of giving Obama “fast-track” authority to negotiate the TPP deal. Under the deal’s terms, Obama said Vietnam is one country that would be forced to improve its labor standards, set a minimum wage, and protect workers’ rights to unionize. “It would be good for the workers in Vietnam even as it helps make sure that they’re not undercutting competition here in the United States,” he said. The TPP would also help more companies move advanced manufacturing to the United States, Obama added. But despite anecdotal evidence that some companies are shifting production back to the U.S., economic data suggest America’s production lines rely more than ever on suppliers from low-wage countries. “The data clearly show no sign of reshoring,” said University of Munich economist Dalia Marin, in a detailed analysis published in November. Lori Wallach of Public Citizen, a government watchdog group, said labor standards in the TPP were too weak, pointing to a U.S. Government Accountability Office study that found similar standards in trade deals with Peru, Colombia, Panama and Korea had failed to improve labor conditions in those countries.

366,NKE,U.S. factory job gains come slowly despite corporate vows,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Nike Inc’s (NKE.N) announcement that it could create up to 10,000 manufacturing jobs in the United States will spark further debate on whether the country is starting to see an industrial renaissance after many years of job losses. Evidence from government and private data suggests it is too early for U.S. workers, or politicians, to celebrate. Any boost in U.S. manufacturing appears so far to be, at best, modest and fragile. The athletic shoemaker Nike on Friday joined Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), General Electric Co (GE.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N) among U.S. businesses promising to invest in manufacturing jobs in the United States. There were 12.3 million U.S. manufacturing jobs in April, up 1.5 percent from a year earlier but well below 1990, when there were almost 18 million jobs, the government reported Friday. How best to expand manufacturing employment will be a prominent question in the 2016 election cycle, especially in Midwestern states such as Ohio and Michigan. But economists and analysts say that excitement over “reshoring,” or shifting jobs back to the United States from overseas, is overdone. “Instead of hundreds of jobs at a time, manufacturers are hiring five or 10 people at a time,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.  Other measures of manufacturing activity suggest that U.S. companies are relying on more imported parts for goods they produce.  The share of U.S. intermediate goods imported from Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe grew from about 2 percent in the late 1990s to almost 5 percent in 2011, only dipping briefly during the recession, according to an analysis published in November by University of Munich economist Dalia Marin.  There are cases that counter the trends seen in the broader measures of job creation.  Tailor Made Products Inc, which makes kitchen utensils, shifted production of spatulas, slotted spoons and other utensils to China about a decade ago. It was “highly likely” the company would have gone out of business otherwise, said chief financial officer Mike Retzer.  But the company had problems with its Chinese suppliers, from delays at the U.S. West Coast ports to contaminants in the plastics used to make them. In April, as part of Wal-Mart’s reshoring effort, Tailor Made opened a new production line in its home town of Elroy, Wisconsin. The company has invested $600,000 in the new line, adding up to 10 jobs to its work force of 65 to start with. More new jobs are expected if production expands. Many of the company’s other kitchen products are still made in China. “We would love to move all of our production back here if we could.” Retzer said. “But we work in an ultra-competitive environment where a penny or two on a product can make all the difference.” Michelle Gloeckler, executive vice president for U.S. manufacturing at Wal-Mart, said the retailer is on track with its plan to buy an estimated $250 billion in U.S. made goods from 2013 to 2023.   In the auto industry, which accounts for about 750,000 U.S. factory jobs, vehicle makers and their parts suppliers are shifting some production out of Asia, in part to reduce the risks posed by delays at U.S. ports or natural disasters such as the 2011 tsunami in Japan.  But Mexico is landing many of those jobs, says Sean McAlinden, chief economist for the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. U.S. auto industry manufacturing employment will grow to about 760,000 workers and then stay at that plateau until the next cyclical downturn, he said. Average pay for U.S. auto workers has stagnated or fallen in recent years, McAlinden said. However, U.S. workers get paid far more than their Mexican counterparts. “Mexican workers are cheaper than Chinese,” he said. “So why not go near-shore rather than far-shore?” In Nike’s case, the company linked its promise to create U.S. jobs to relief from tariffs on imported shoes. Those levies average around 25 percent to 35 percent, depending on the materials used and the type of shoe, according to the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America.

367,NKE,U.S. factory job gains come slowly despite corporate vows,"* U.S. manufacturing: Big promises, small gains * Factory jobs have increased but are below 1990s peak * Economists say “reshoring” adds few U.S. jobs * China’s losses are Mexico’s gains By Joseph White, Howard Schneider and Nick Carey DETROIT, May 8 (Reuters) - Nike Inc’s announcement that it could create up to 10,000 manufacturing jobs in the United States will spark further debate on whether the country is starting to see an industrial renaissance after many years of job losses. Evidence from government and private data suggests it is too early for U.S. workers, or politicians, to celebrate. Any boost in U.S. manufacturing appears so far to be, at best, modest and fragile. The athletic shoemaker Nike on Friday joined Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Apple Inc, General Electric Co and Ford Motor Co among U.S. businesses promising to invest in manufacturing jobs in the United States. There were 12.3 million U.S. manufacturing jobs in April, up 1.5 percent from a year earlier but well below 1990, when there were almost 18 million jobs, the government reported Friday. How best to expand manufacturing employment will be a prominent question in the 2016 election cycle, especially in Midwestern states such as Ohio and Michigan. But economists and analysts say that excitement over “reshoring,” or shifting jobs back to the United States from overseas, is overdone. “Instead of hundreds of jobs at a time, manufacturers are hiring five or 10 people at a time,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. Other measures of manufacturing activity suggest that U.S. companies are relying on more imported parts for goods they produce. The share of U.S. intermediate goods imported from Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe grew from about 2 percent in the late 1990s to almost 5 percent in 2011, only dipping briefly during the recession, according to an analysis published in November by University of Munich economist Dalia Marin. There are cases that counter the trends seen in the broader measures of job creation. Tailor Made Products Inc, which makes kitchen utensils, shifted production of spatulas, slotted spoons and other utensils to China about a decade ago. It was “highly likely” the company would have gone out of business otherwise, said chief financial officer Mike Retzer. But the company had problems with its Chinese suppliers, from delays at the U.S. West Coast ports to contaminants in the plastics used to make them. In April, as part of Wal-Mart’s reshoring effort, Tailor Made opened a new production line in its home town of Elroy, Wisconsin. The company has invested $600,000 in the new line, adding up to 10 jobs to its work force of 65 to start with. More new jobs are expected if production expands. Many of the company’s other kitchen products are still made in China. “We would love to move all of our production back here if we could.” Retzer said. “But we work in an ultra-competitive environment where a penny or two on a product can make all the difference.” Michelle Gloeckler, executive vice president for U.S. manufacturing at Wal-Mart, said the retailer is on track with its plan to buy an estimated $250 billion in U.S. made goods from 2013 to 2023. In the auto industry, which accounts for about 750,000 U.S. factory jobs, vehicle makers and their parts suppliers are shifting some production out of Asia, in part to reduce the risks posed by delays at U.S. ports or natural disasters such as the 2011 tsunami in Japan. But Mexico is landing many of those jobs, says Sean McAlinden, chief economist for the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. U.S. auto industry manufacturing employment will grow to about 760,000 workers and then stay at that plateau until the next cyclical downturn, he said. Average pay for U.S. auto workers has stagnated or fallen in recent years, McAlinden said. However, U.S. workers get paid far more than their Mexican counterparts. “Mexican workers are cheaper than Chinese,” he said. “So why not go near-shore rather than far-shore?” In Nike’s case, the company linked its promise to create U.S. jobs to relief from tariffs on imported shoes. Those levies average around 25 percent to 35 percent, depending on the materials used and the type of shoe, according to the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America. U.S. firms paid about $400 million in tariffs in 2014 for shoes imported from countries that would be included in a Trans-Pacific trade pact, notably Vietnam, according to the trade group.

370,NKE,"Nike backs Obama on trade with pledge to create 10,000 U.S. jobs","PORTLAND, Oregon, May 8 (Reuters) - Sports shoe maker Nike Inc put its weight behind President Barack Obama’s push for a trade deal with Asian countries on Friday with a promise to create up to 10,000 U.S.-based manufacturing jobs if the pact is approved. In an announcement that coincided with a visit by Obama to Nike’s Oregon headquarters, the company said footwear tariff relief within the proposed 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement would allow it to speed up investment in “advanced footwear manufacturing” in the United States. Obama is pressing the U.S. Congress to pass Trade Promotion Authority, which would enable him to negotiate international trade deals without the threat of changes by lawmakers. If TPA is passed and the TPP deal is sealed, Nike said, it would accelerate its U.S. investments and spur as many as 10,000 domestic manufacturing and engineering jobs, thousands of construction jobs, and up to 40,000 jobs elsewhere in its supply chain over 10 years. Nike has 26,000 employees in the United States and more than 1 million workers in 700 contract factories worldwide that manufacture its shoes. Its top-end soccer and baseball shoes retail for more than $300. “We believe agreements that encourage free and fair trade allow Nike to do what we do best: innovate, expand our businesses and drive economic growth,” said Nike Chief Executive Officer Mark Parker in a media release distributed by the White House. The company did not say in the media release what it would pay those workers or where the U.S. jobs would be located. Obama is scheduled to visit Nike’s headquarters later on Friday. The trip was designed to help sell the free-trade agreement to skeptical Democrats, who say it will put more American workers out of jobs and cut their wages while enriching companies. An administration official said Nike approached the White House about the issue, which led to the trip. White House aides have been coy all week about why they chose Nike, which suffered for years from a tarnished image for using Asian sweatshops to make its products. Imports accounted for as much as 98 percent of the U.S. market for apparel, although that number has fallen slightly,  according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association.

373,NKE,Soccer sponsors dismayed by corruption allegations at FIFA,"NEW YORK, May 27 (Reuters) - World Cup sponsor Nike Inc  said on Wednesday it was cooperating with authorities after bribery and corruption charges against senior FIFA officials were announced by U.S. prosecutors and arrests were made in Switzerland. U.S. prosecutors issued an indictment accusing nine  officials from soccer’s world governing body and five sports media and promotions executives of bribes involving more than $150 million over 24 years. The indictment also said that in 1996, a global sports company, which was not identified in court documents, agreed to pay $160 million over 10 years to become the Brazil team’s exclusive footwear, apparel, accessories, and equipment supplier. That was an apparent reference to Nike Inc, which sponsored the Brazil national team. The indictment said the company had agreed to financial terms not in the initial contract, which included paying an additional $40 million to an affiliate of the team’s marketing agent with a Swiss bank account and referring to the amount as “marketing fees.” U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch was asked at a news conference if there was any liability for companies that had won marketing rights and if they were being investigated. Lynch said she could not comment on specifics of who else was a target or subject of the investigation “except to say that the investigation is continuing and covers all aspects.” She declined to comment when asked if one of the companies was Nike. Later on, Nike said in a statement, “Like fans everywhere we care passionately about the game and are concerned by the very serious allegations.” “Nike believes in ethical and fair play in both business and sport and strongly opposes any form of manipulation or bribery. We have been cooperating, and will continue to cooperate, with the authorities,” the company said. Nike did not respond to a request for comment beyond its statement. German sportswear company Adidas and beverage company Coca-Cola Co called on FIFA to increase transparency and resolve the controversy. “This lengthy controversy has tarnished the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup and we have repeatedly expressed our concerns about these serious allegations,” Coca Cola said in a statement. Anheuser-Busch InBev and McDonald’s Corp  said they were in contact with FIFA and monitoring the situation. World Cup sponsors are in an awkward position, experts said, because they are under pressure from consumers to distance themselves from any corruption, but such sponsorships are lucrative in the long term. “The value of the sponsorships is very high or they wouldn’t be prepared to pay so much for it,” said Interbrand Chief Executive Jez Frampton. “Football is one of the few global properties that enables you to connect with people around the world.” Rob Prazmark, president of 21 Sports & Entertainment Marketing Group, a global sports and event sales agency said companies were unlikely to pull their sponsorships altogether. “These sponsors put a lot of money into associating with the World Cup,” Prazmark said. “They’ll give them a little bit of time to get their house in order.”   (Additional reporting by Emma Thomasson, Lindsay Dunsmuir and Nate Raymond; Editing by Toni Reinhold)",5272015,http://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-fifa-sponsors/soccer-sponsors-dismayed-by-corruption-allegations-at-fifa-idUSL1N0YI2N120150527
374,NKE,"WRAPUP 7-World soccer rocked by U.S., Swiss arrests of officials for graft","(Adds ex-FIFA vice president Warner court appearance, statements by FIFA sponsors, Nike and Coca-Cola) * Nine FIFA officials, five corporate executives indicted * Seven top soccer figures arrested in Switzerland * Authorities seek arrests of others - U.S. prosecutors * High-ranking officials in Switzerland for FIFA Congress * Swiss criminal probe related to Russia, Qatar World Cups By Mike Collett, Brian Homewood and Nate Raymond ZURICH/NEW YORK, May 27 (Reuters) - The world’s most popular sport was plunged into turmoil on Wednesday as seven senior soccer officials were arrested on U.S. corruption charges and faced extradition from Switzerland, whose authorities also announced a criminal investigation into the awarding of the next two World Cups. The arrests in a dawn raid at a five-star Zurich hotel mark an unprecedented blow against soccer’s governing body FIFA, which for years has been dogged by allegations of corruption but always escaped major criminal cases. U.S. prosecutors said they aimed to make more arrests but would not be drawn on whether FIFA President Sepp Blatter, for long the most powerful man in the sport, was a target of the probe. Blatter, 79, is standing for re-election to a fifth term at the FIFA Congress in Zurich on Friday, and FIFA said the vote would go ahead as planned. The European soccer body UEFA called for the election to be postponed, saying “the European associations will have to consider carefully if they should even attend this Congress.” In a scathing indictment of corruption in soccer, U.S. authorities said nine officials and five sports media and promotions executives were charged in cases involving more than $150 million in bribes over a period of 24 years. They said their investigation exposed complex money laundering schemes, millions of dollars in untaxed incomes and tens of millions in offshore accounts held by FIFA officials. Swiss police arrested the seven, all from the Latin American and Caribbean region, and detained them pending extradition proceedings to the United States, which could take years if they contest the process. The Federal Office of Justice in Switzerland said that six would contest extradition, but that one person agreed to be extradited. “As charged in the indictment, the defendants fostered a culture of corruption and greed that created an uneven playing field for the biggest sport in the world,” said Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey. “Undisclosed and illegal payments, kickbacks, and bribes became a way of doing business at FIFA.” Blatter, who has denied and survived allegations of his involvement in corruption, said in a statement: “Let me be clear: such misconduct has no place in football and we will ensure that those who engage in it are put out of the game.” The statement also said that FIFA welcomed the actions and the investigations “and believe that it will help to reinforce measures that FIFA has already taken to root out any wrongdoing in football.” Separate from the U.S. investigation, Swiss prosecutors said they had opened their own criminal proceedings against unidentified people on suspicion of mismanagement and money laundering related to the awarding of rights to host the 2018 World Cup in Russia and the 2022 event in Qatar. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch told reporters at a news conference in New York her office did not want to impede the 2018 and 2022 World Cups but looked forward to working with Swiss authorities investigating the award of the tournaments. “FIFA has a lot of soul searching to do,” she said. The indictment accused the officials of using a variety of schemes to take kickbacks and bribes from sports marketing firms connected to major tournaments, and also alleged corruption in the selection of the 2010 World Cup host and the 2011 FIFA presidential election. One of those indicted, former FIFA Vice President Jack Warner of Trinidad, solicited $10 million in bribes from the South African government to host the 2010 World Cup, the Justice Department said. Warner directed a number of co-conspirators to arrange the payment, which was eventually sent from a FIFA account in Switzerland to a Bank of America account in New York that Warner controlled, the indictment said. The South African Football Association called the bribe allegations “baseless and untested.” Warner, former FIFA vice president and executive committee member of CONCACAF (Confederation of North, Central America, Caribbean Association Football), said in a statement that he was innocent of any charges. Warner surrendered to the police mid-afternoon in Port of Spain, made an initial court appearance on 12 charges of corruption, money laundering and racketeering and was granted TT$2.5 million ($400,000) bail. The United States took jurisdiction of the case in part because the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI secured the cooperation of U.S. citizen Chuck Blazer, a former top FIFA official, who U.S. officials said had not paid taxes for years. Blazer’s lawyer, Eric Corngold, declined to comment. Kelly Currie, the acting U.S. attorney in Brooklyn said Wednesday’s charges brought in the New York City borough represent “the beginning of our effort, not the end.” Early Wednesday, FBI agents carrying bags and boxes to execute a search warrant went into the group’s office in Miami Beach. Agents also used a search warrant at the offices of Traffic Sports in Miami. CONCACAF said in a statement it was “deeply concerned by today’s developments” and that “the Confederation will continue to cooperate with the authorities to its fullest capacity.” In addition to Blazer, 70, others who pleaded guilty were José Hawilla, 71, owner of the Traffic Group, a sports marketing firm founded in Brazil, and two of his companies; Daryan Warner, 46, and Daryll Warner, 40, sons of Jack Warner. Their lawyers declined comment or were not available to comment. “It is clear that the case is based in large part on some cooperating insiders who have already plead guilty,” said Miami lawyer David Weinstein, former prosecutor. The FIFA officials appeared to have walked into a trap set by U.S. and Swiss authorities. The arrests were made at dawn at a plush Zurich hotel, the Baur au Lac, where officials are staying before the vote. Suites at the hotel cost up to $4,000 a night. The arrests could have implications for sponsorship. The indictment said that in 1996, an unidentified global sports company agreed to pay $160 million over 10 years to become Brazil’s exclusive footwear, apparel, accessories, and equipment supplier. That was an apparent reference to Nike Inc , which sponsored the Brazil national team. Nike said that it was cooperating with authorities. “Nike believes in ethical and fair play in both business and sport...,” a company statement said. The indictment said that the company agreed to additional financial terms not in the initial contract. This included paying an additional $40 million to “a Traffic affiliate with a Swiss bank account” and referred to as “marketing fees.” German sportswear company Adidas, long associated with FIFA, said the soccer body should do more to establish transparent compliance standards. Anheuser-Busch InBev, whose Budweiser brand is a sponsor of the 2018 World Cup, said it was closely monitoring developments at FIFA. Coca-Cola Co, another FIFA sponsor, said the charges had “tarnished the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup and we have repeatedly expressed our concerns about these serious allegations.” Officials said that following the arrests, accounts at several banks in Switzerland had been blocked. The officials arrested in Zurich are: Jeffrey Webb, vice-president of world body FIFA, president of North and Central American body CONCACAF and head of soccer in the Cayman Islands; Eduardo Li, who runs Costa Rica’s soccer federation; Julio Rocha, who headed Nicaragua’s federation; Eugenio Figueredo, another FIFA vice-president who used to run Uruguayan soccer; Rafael Esquivel who is the sport’s boss in Venezuela; Jose Maria Marin, who used to be the head of Brazil’s federation; and Costas Takkas, another CONCACAF official. Those detained or their representatives were not available to comment. Lynch said in a statement that the charges span “at least two generations of soccer officials who, as alleged, have abused their positions of trust to acquire millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks.” The international governing body of football collects billions of dollars in revenue, mostly from sponsorship and television rights for World Cups. It has been dogged by reports of corruption which it says it investigates itself. “The chickens are finally coming home to roost and this sounds like a hugely significant development for FIFA,” said Damian Collins, a British member of parliament who founded the reform group New FIFA Now. FIFA’s decision to award the World Cup to Qatar, a tiny desert country with no domestic tradition of soccer, was heavily criticised by soccer officials in Western countries. FIFA was forced to acknowledge that it is too hot to play soccer there in the summer when the tournament is traditionally held, forcing schedules around the globe to be rewritten to move the event. Qatar’s stock market fell sharply as news of the Swiss investigation emerged.

378,NKE,UPDATE 4-Visa threatens to ditch FIFA as sponsor dismay mounts,"* Visa says disappointment with FIFA is “profound” * Consumers attack brands on Twitter * Nike says cooperating with authorities * Adidas, Coca-Cola Hyundai, McDonald’s, Anheuser-Busch concerned * World Cup seen as too lucrative to ditch   (Adds comment, background) By Anjali Athavaley and Emma Thomasson NEW YORK/BERLIN, May 28 (Reuters) - Visa Inc has told FIFA it could end its sponsorship if soccer’s governing body does not act fast to restore the reputation of the game after senior officials were arrested on  corruption charges. The statement from Visa was the strongest so far as sponsors lined up to express concern about the scandal engulfing the world’s most popular sport and their customers took to social media to threaten a boycott of brands associated with FIFA. Sponsors are trying to balance the growing sensitivity of consumers to corruption, human rights abuses and environmental issues against their relationship with the organisation that holds the keys to a billion soccer fans worldwide. “Our disappointment and concern with FIFA in light of today’s developments is profound. As a sponsor, we expect FIFA to take swift and immediate steps to address these issues within its organization,” Visa said. “This starts with rebuilding a culture with strong ethical practices,” it said. “Should FIFA fail to do so, we have informed them that we will reassess our sponsorship.” U.S. prosecutors issued an indictment on Wednesday accusing nine officials from soccer’s world governing body and five sports media and promotions executives of bribes involving more than $150 million over 24 years. Airline Emirates and Japanese electronics maker Sony Corp announced in November they would not renew deals with FIFA, although rivals Qatar Airways and Samsung  are reportedly in talks to replace them. Emirates and Sony were among FIFA’s six main partners who together paid a total of $177 million in 2014 for the right to advertise in World Cup stadiums and use the FIFA trademark. A source familiar with the Sony decision said suspected corruption was one factor behind Sony’s withdrawal although the main reason was the high cost of the sponsorship deal. Sponsors have long faced risks to their brands from sports scandals ranging from doping to match fixing to misbehaviour of top players on and off the pitch. Sponsors including Nike Inc dropped American cyclist Lance Armstrong in 2012 after he was banned for doping, but Germany’s Adidas decided last year to stick with Uruguay’s Luis Suarez after FIFA banned him for nine matches for biting an Italy defender. “Brands have to take a longer-term view. Any sport is littered with controversy on and off the field,” said Paul Smith, founder of sports marketing research group Repucom. “What fans care about most of all is the game itself rather than the business of the game... Being a sponsor of FIFA implies you are a sponsor of the game, not of the organisation.” FIFA’s longest standing partners are Adidas and Coca-Cola Co . Adidas has been the provider of the World Cup match ball since 1970 and has a partnership lasting until 2030, while the current deal for Coca-Cola, which has had a formal association since 1974 and has advertised in every World Cup stadium since 1950, lasts until 2022. That perhaps explains why they stopped short of threatening to cut ties like Visa, the world’s largest credit and debit card company, which only became a FIFA partner in 2007 and recently extended the relationship until 2022. “This lengthy controversy has tarnished the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup and we have repeatedly expressed our concerns about these serious allegations,” Coca Cola said. Adidas, which is the world’s biggest manufacturer of soccer balls, boots and shirts, side stepped outright criticism, calling instead for FIFA “to continue to establish and follow transparent compliance standards”. Its shares fell 1.5 percent on Thursday. Meanwhile, Nike, which is not a FIFA partner but is challenging Adidas’ dominance in soccer by sponsoring many of the world’s top players and teams, said it was cooperating with authorities after it was indirectly identified in the U.S. indictment in relation to a 1996 deal with the Brazil team. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch declined to comment on whether there was any liability for companies that had won marketing rights and if they were being investigated. But she said “the investigation is continuing and covers all aspects.” She declined to comment when asked if one of the companies was Nike. Nike later said in a statement it was “concerned by the very serious allegations, adding: “Nike believes in ethical and fair play in both business and sport and strongly opposes any form of manipulation or bribery.” FIFA’s main sponsors were already getting uneasy even before the latest revelations. Adidas, Visa and Coca-Cola all made statements last week pushing FIFA to take seriously the issue of rights for migrant workers in Qatar, responding to reports of abuses at the 2022 World Cup construction sites. That came after campaigners designed spoof ads for major FIFA sponsors subverting their brand images, including a Coca-Cola can dripping with oil and the iconic three stripes of Adidas tweaked to look like a line of gravestones. The pressure only mounted after Wednesday’s news, with social media full of appeals for brands to cut ties with FIFA. “Adidas, Visa, Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Budweiser, Hyundai: stop supporting corrupt FIFA or I stop buying your brands,” wrote Stefan-Joerg Goebel on Twitter. The Institute of Directors (IoD), a leading UK authority on corporate governance, said risks were mounting for sponsors. “They have a responsibility to their shareholders to make certain that the company’s cash is not going towards sporting events mired in bribery and corruption allegations,” said Roger Barker, IoD director of corporate governance. South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor, the sole Asian FIFA partner for the 2018 World Cup due to be held in Russia, said it was “extremely concerned” about the legal proceedings, while Bud-owner Anheuser-Busch InBev and McDonald’s Corp said they were in contact with FIFA. Australian sportswear company SKINS, which announced in a tongue-in-cheek campaign in January that it was the first “official” FIFA non-sponsor, urged the brands to clean up FIFA. “The only people FIFA will listen to are the sponsors. The real money is with the broadcasters but their brands aren’t exposed in the same way as the sponsors,” said SKINS chairman Jaimie Fuller. But brand experts were sceptical of a mass exodus of FIFA sponsors. “Football is one of the few global properties that enables you to connect with people around the world,” said Interbrand Chief Executive Jez Frampton. Rob Prazmark, president of 21 Sports & Entertainment Marketing Group, a global sports and event sales agency agreed: “These sponsors put a lot of money into associating with the World Cup,” he said. “They’ll give them a little bit of time to get their house in order.”   (Additional reporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir, Nate Raymond, Steve Slater, Ando Ritsuko and Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by David Stamp and Giles Elgood)",5282015,http://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-fifa-sponsors/update-4-visa-threatens-to-ditch-fifa-as-sponsor-dismay-mounts-idUSL1N0YJ06M20150528
379,NKE,Nike seen avoiding charges in soccer bribery probe - lawyers,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nike Inc may be able to avoid U.S. charges over any involvement in bribery payments to win soccer sponsorships, but could face penalties if U.S. prosecutors decide to clamp down on the global sportswear giant, lawyers with expertise in the subject said. Although Nike has not been named or charged with any wrongdoing, the company was swept into the corruption scandal that engulfed soccer’s governing body FIFA when a U.S. indictment released on Wednesday described apparent kickback payments linked to a landmark 1996 Nike deal in Brazil. In a statement on Thursday, Nike said that the charges did not allege that it engaged in criminal conduct or that any Nike employee was aware of or took part in a bribery scheme. On Wednesday, in another statement, it did not confirm or deny that it was the company in the indictment, but said it was cooperating with authorities. The description of the $160 million, 10-year deal signed by “Sportswear Company A” matched exactly the details of Nike’s agreement to become the footwear and apparel supplier and sponsor of the world’s most successful national soccer team. Still, the U.S. Justice Department is likely to take a tougher stance against those who solicited bribes than those who paid them, especially if a company did not have a long history of paying bribes, said former U.S. federal prosecutor Michael Volkov. “Where the case is going, it’s not focusing as much on the people who were shaken down as it is on the people doing the shaking,” Volkov said. While the 14 defendants in the indictment are being charged with crimes such as money laundering and wire fraud, the United States has normally prosecuted U.S. businesses for foreign bribery under the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). That law’s anti-bribery provisions apply to dealings with governments and government officials and may not be of much use in the soccer world because soccer associations are typically not government agencies. The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF), which signed the 1996 deal with Nike, is a private organization. “The FCPA does not prohibit private bribery,” said Homer Moyer, who specializes in FCPA cases at the law firm Miller & Chevalier in Washington. If Nike is thought to have paid bribes by transferring funds from a U.S.-based account, the Justice Department might consider charging the company with “international promotional money laundering,” said a former official with the Justice Department’s money laundering section. While seldom used in the past, prosecutors have made increased used of this charge in recent years, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to his private sector work. Prosecutors could employ a provision of the FCPA that requires companies to keep accurate accounting records. If the sportswear company in the Brazil deal disguised or hid wrongdoing in its books, it may have violated the law, lawyers said. The indictment came less than three weeks after U.S. President Barack Obama co-opted Nike’s “just do it” slogan in a speech promoting a Pacific free-trade deal at the company’s headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon. The charge sheet said that “Sportswear Company A” agreed to pay an additional $40 million in “marketing fees” that were not in the initial contract to the Swiss bank account of an affiliate of Brazilian sports marketing firm Traffic. Traffic’s founder Jose Hawilla, whose guilty plea to U.S. corruption charges was revealed at the same time as the indictment, agreed in 1996 to pay half of everything he made from the deal to an unidentified senior member of the CBF, according to the Department of Justice. That amounted to “millions of dollars, as a bribe and kickback,” the indictment said. U.S. prosecutors have used the FCPA to extract massive settlements, often with foreign businesses. In 2009, the U.S. engineering company KBR Inc agreed to a $579 million settlement over bribes paid to Nigerian government officials. Separate from the FCPA, foreign and U.S. banks have paid billions of dollars in settlements with U.S. authorities over sanctions-busting activities and anti-money laundering failures in recent years. A number of non-banks have also been targeted by regulators or the Justice Department over anti-money laundering failures. The indictment also alleged that a New Jersey-based “Sports Marketing Company A” paid bribes to the head of South American soccer association CONMEBOL in exchange for gaining exclusive marketing rights to the Copa Libertadores tournament. Asked Wednesday if companies that had won soccer marketing rights faced criminal liability or were being investigated, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said she could not comment on specific investigation targets.

383,NKE,"RPT-Brazil soccer probe to put harsh glare on Nike, other sponsors","(Repeats story with no change to text) By Brad Haynes and Anthony Boadle SAO PAULO/BRASILIA, June 5 (Reuters) - Nike Inc and some other big international companies face a grilling over their powerful role in Brazilian soccer as a former star player turned senator vows to expose what he describes as suspect marketing contracts and their links to corrupt payments. Romario, a revered striker who led Brazil to victory at the 1994 World Cup wearing the U.S. sportswear giant’s boots, is leading a new congressional probe into sponsorship deals in the wake of U.S. graft charges that have shaken the soccer world. Three Brazilians were among those named and charged in the U.S. indictment, including a former head of the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF). Neither Romario nor Brazilian prosecutors have alleged that Nike did anything illegal, despite the company’s $160 million deal in 1996 to sponsor Brazil’s team being linked to kickback payments in the U.S. indictment released last week. Nike was not named in the indictment but there was only one company that fit the prosecutors’ description. In a statement last week, Nike noted that the charges did not allege it engaged in criminal conduct or that its employees were involved in or aware of bribery. Romario, Brazil’s leading voice for soccer reform whose playing fame boosts his influence, says he wants to investigate such sponsorship deals to see if they were used to funnel money to officials and exert undue influence on the sport. The commission, which will start next week, will have the power to subpoena witnesses, bank records and private contracts, but cannot issue search or arrest warrants. Among companies whose sponsorship deals with the Brazil team have come under scrutiny in recent years are airline TAM, the Brazilian arm of regional giant Latam Airlines Group, and Ambev SA, now a subsidiary of Budweiser-maker Anheuser-Busch InBev. “These brands are going to be front and center in the investigation ... They won’t be able to remain silent,” said  Fernando Ferreira, head of sports marketing firm Pluri, citing the heavy focus on sponsors in a similar probe 15 years ago. “People are fed up and they want to know what sponsors are doing with the power of their checkbooks to demand changes in the sport.” Sponsors in Brazil have been hesitant to publicly address corruption concerns, emphasizing their support for the national team rather than the CBF. The use of intermediaries is common in contracts in Brazil and sponsors may not have any direct knowledge of wrongdoing. Previous investigations have revealed deals for broadcast and marketing rights that involve intermediary firms funneling sponsorship money to close associates of CBF officials, opening the door to kickbacks and bribery. Romario met with Brazil’s top federal prosecutor on Monday and said they were cooperating on the investigation. Federal police have investigated former CBF officials for money laundering and tax evasion, but federal prosecutors have not confirmed any formal charges. One lawyer with expertise on corruption cases and corporate compliance said that the CBF’s status as a private entity meant that a company could not be charged with giving it bribes. “At worst, the problem will be damage to its (the company’s) image,” said the lawyer, who asked not to be identified. Prosecutors would have to go after intermediaries on other charges, like money laundering and tax fraud, he said. The U.S. indictment said that in the 1996 deal “Sportswear Company A” - apparently Nike - agreed to pay $40 million in “marketing fees” that were not in its initial contract with the CBF to the Swiss bank account of an affiliate of Brazilian sports marketing firm Traffic. Jose Hawilla, the founder of Traffic who was named by the indictment as convicted on graft charges, agreed to pay half of everything he made from the deal to an unidentified senior member of the CBF, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. That amounted to “millions of dollars, as a bribe and kickback,” the indictment said. The new Brazilian Senate inquiry reprises a congressional probe 15 years ago. The probe was consumed by political infighting and did not result in formal charges. But it brought to light previously secret aspects of the Nike deal that gave the firm remarkable influence over the team that has won the World Cup an unmatched five times. It revealed that the deal gave Nike the right to arrange five friendly matches for the team per year, picking opponents and players included in so-called “Nike games”. Lawmakers also grilled a Nike executive and coaches over one of the world’s greatest soccer conspiracy theories - that pressure from the sponsorship deal led to the selection of star striker and Nike poster boy Ronaldo in the 1998 World Cup final even though he was sick. Brazil lost the game. Nike and Ronaldo denied the allegations. Despite the controversy, Nike’s Brazil business has thrived. The country contributes around a billion dollars of Nike’s annual revenue, about 5 percent of its global business, compared to just half a billion in revenue from all of Latin America and other non-core markets in 1996. Romario’s new investigation quickly gathered the support of fellow senators and President Dilma Rousseff’s government. He says Brazilians will not tolerate the impunity that followed the last probe. “I think it’s a very different moment. The soccer kingpins are weak. The whole world is watching. This isn’t just about soccer in Brazil,” he told Reuters by email. “What I can promise you is that I will do everything possible to put the crooks behind bars.” Those who investigated the deals of the 1990s say business practices around the sport have changed little. “In recent years, the soccer deals have grown much bigger, but they’re still based on the same model, with intermediaries and shell companies to launder money,” lawmaker Silvio Torres, who authored a report on the 2000 commission, told Reuters. Several of the sponsorships he investigated remain in place. Romario has flagged sponsorships as an avenue for graft in the CBF, citing one deal with TAM. TAM stopped sponsoring the national team in 2012 after a newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported that its contract paid $7 million per year to companies owned by a close associate of former CBF President Ricardo Teixeira. A TAM representative said it was ready to clarify the details of its 2007-2012 sponsorship to authorities. A Senate investigation uncovered details of a 2001 Ambev sponsorship deal in which at least $9 million went to an intermediary company owned by a close associate of Teixeira. Ambev and Inbev declined to comment on the matter. Teixeira left the CBF in 2012 amid a police investigation into reports that he had taken millions of dollars in bribes from a sports marketing firm. He denied the allegations and was not charged for any wrongdoing. Efforts to reach Teixeira were unsuccessful. Current CBF President Marco Polo Del Nero says he knew nothing about alleged bribery schemes involving the federation and is cooperating with official investigations. Under Nike’s current Brazilian sponsorship deal through 2026, details of which are not public, the firm pays the CBF $40 million per year, according to a source familiar with the contract.

They won’t be able to remain silent,” said  Fernando Ferreira, head of sports marketing firm Pluri, citing the heavy focus on sponsors in a similar probe 15 years ago. “People are fed up and they want to know what sponsors are doing with the power of their checkbooks to demand changes in the sport.” Sponsors in Brazil have been hesitant to publicly address corruption concerns, emphasizing their support for the national team rather than the CBF. The use of intermediaries is common in contracts in Brazil and sponsors may not have any direct knowledge of wrongdoing. Previous investigations have revealed deals for broadcast and marketing rights that involve intermediary firms funneling sponsorship money to close associates of CBF officials, opening the door to kickbacks and bribery. Romario met with Brazil’s top federal prosecutor on Monday and said they were cooperating on the investigation. Federal police have investigated former CBF officials for money laundering and tax evasion, but federal prosecutors have not confirmed any formal charges. One lawyer with expertise on corruption cases and corporate compliance said that the CBF’s status as a private entity meant that a company could not be charged with giving it bribes. “At worst, the problem will be damage to its (the company’s) image,” said the lawyer, who asked not to be identified. Prosecutors would have to go after intermediaries on other charges, like money laundering and tax fraud, he said. The U.S. indictment said that in the 1996 deal “Sportswear Company A” - apparently Nike - agreed to pay $40 million in “marketing fees” that were not in its initial contract with the CBF to the Swiss bank account of an affiliate of Brazilian sports marketing firm Traffic. Jose Hawilla, the founder of Traffic who was named by the indictment as convicted on graft charges, agreed to pay half of everything he made from the deal to an unidentified senior member of the CBF, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. That amounted to “millions of dollars, as a bribe and kickback,” the indictment said. The new Brazilian Senate inquiry reprises a congressional probe 15 years ago. The probe was consumed by political infighting and did not result in formal charges. But it brought to light previously secret aspects of the Nike deal that gave the firm remarkable influence over the team that has won the World Cup an unmatched five times. It revealed that the deal gave Nike the right to arrange five friendly matches for the team per year, picking opponents and players included in so-called “Nike games”. Lawmakers also grilled a Nike executive and coaches over one of the world’s greatest soccer conspiracy theories - that pressure from the sponsorship deal led to the selection of star striker and Nike poster boy Ronaldo in the 1998 World Cup final even though he was sick. Brazil lost the game. Nike and Ronaldo denied the allegations. Despite the controversy, Nike’s Brazil business has thrived. The country contributes around a billion dollars of Nike’s annual revenue, about 5 percent of its global business, compared to just half a billion in revenue from all of Latin America and other non-core markets in 1996. Romario’s new investigation quickly gathered the support of fellow senators and President Dilma Rousseff’s government. He says Brazilians will not tolerate the impunity that followed the last probe. “I think it’s a very different moment. The soccer kingpins are weak. The whole world is watching. This isn’t just about soccer in Brazil,” he told Reuters by email. “What I can promise you is that I will do everything possible to put the crooks behind bars.” Those who investigated the deals of the 1990s say business practices around the sport have changed little. “In recent years, the soccer deals have grown much bigger, but they’re still based on the same model, with intermediaries and shell companies to launder money,” lawmaker Silvio Torres, who authored a report on the 2000 commission, told Reuters. Several of the sponsorships he investigated remain in place. Romario has flagged sponsorships as an avenue for graft in the CBF, citing one deal with TAM. TAM stopped sponsoring the national team in 2012 after a newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported that its contract paid $7 million per year to companies owned by a close associate of former CBF President Ricardo Teixeira. A TAM representative said it was ready to clarify the details of its 2007-2012 sponsorship to authorities. A Senate investigation uncovered details of a 2001 Ambev sponsorship deal in which at least $9 million went to an intermediary company owned by a close associate of Teixeira. Ambev and Inbev declined to comment on the matter. Teixeira left the CBF in 2012 amid a police investigation into reports that he had taken millions of dollars in bribes from a sports marketing firm. He denied the allegations and was not charged for any wrongdoing. Efforts to reach Teixeira were unsuccessful. Current CBF President Marco Polo Del Nero says he knew nothing about alleged bribery schemes involving the federation and is cooperating with official investigations. Under Nike’s current Brazilian sponsorship deal through 2026, details of which are not public, the firm pays the CBF $40 million per year, according to a source familiar with the contract.

386,NKE,"Brazil soccer probe to put harsh glare on Nike, other sponsors","SAO PAULO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - Nike Inc and some other big international companies face a grilling over their powerful role in Brazilian soccer as a former star player turned senator vows to expose what he describes as suspect marketing contracts and their links to corrupt payments. Romario, a revered striker who led Brazil to victory at the 1994 World Cup wearing the U.S. sportswear giant’s boots, is leading a new congressional probe into sponsorship deals in the wake of U.S. graft charges that have shaken the soccer world.  Three Brazilians were among those named and charged in the U.S. indictment, including a former head of the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF). Neither Romario nor Brazilian prosecutors have alleged that Nike did anything illegal, despite the company’s $160 million deal in 1996 to sponsor Brazil’s team being linked to kickback payments in the U.S. indictment released last week. Nike was not named in the indictment but there was only one company that fit the prosecutors’ description. In a statement last week, Nike noted that the charges did not allege it engaged in criminal conduct or that its employees were involved in or aware of bribery. Romario, Brazil’s leading voice for soccer reform whose playing fame boosts his influence, says he wants to investigate such sponsorship deals to see if they were used to funnel money to officials and exert undue influence on the sport. The commission, which will start next week, will have the power to subpoena witnesses, bank records and private contracts, but cannot issue search or arrest warrants.  Among companies whose sponsorship deals with the Brazil team have come under scrutiny in recent years are airline TAM, the Brazilian arm of regional giant Latam Airlines Group, and Ambev SA, now a subsidiary of Budweiser-maker Anheuser-Busch InBev. “These brands are going to be front and center in the investigation ...

387,NKE,Nike settles with designers it accused of stealing secrets,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nike Inc has settled a lawsuit against three former shoe designers it had accused of stealing its commercial secrets and taking them to German rival Adidas AG  with plans to open a footwear design studio in Brooklyn. The designers’ attorney, Matt Levin, said in a statement Tuesday that the case had been resolved through a confidential settlement. Both Nike and Adidas declined to comment, but a clerk with the state court in Oregon, where the lawsuit was filed, said both sides agreed to dismiss the matter on June 4. Nike, the world’s largest sportswear maker, sued Denis Dekovic, Marc Dolce and Mark Miner last December for at least $10 million in damages, alleging that the trio started consulting for Adidas while still working at Nike, violating their non-compete agreements. Before leaving Nike, the complaint alleged, the designers copied sensitive documents, including drawings for an unreleased shoe made for one of Nike’s sponsored athletes, and tried to cover their tracks by erasing emails and text messages from their work-issued cellphones and laptops. Nike’s complaint said the trio brought Adidas information about Nike’s plans for its running, sportswear and soccer lines and pitched Adidas on a design studio that was a knockoff of its own design lab. Last September, Adidas announced it would open an urban footwear design studio in Brooklyn, to be staffed by Dekovic, Dolce and Miner. Nike also claimed that Adidas knew of the non-compete agreements and promised to pay for any legal fallout.

393,NKE,"INSIGHT-Robots could restore ""Made in Germany"" label to Adidas shoes","* Robots to cut labour costs by 18 pct by 2025 - BCG * Adidas targets prototype in-store production by 2016 * Nike promises to create 10,000 jobs for US production * “Knitted” shoes need half the labour, 80 pct fewer parts * Footwear industry employs millions in China, Vietnam, Brazil By Emma Thomasson HERZOGENAURACH, Germany, June 10 (Reuters) - German cobbler Adi Dassler revolutionised running when he started hammering spikes into track shoes almost a century ago. Today most of the 258 million pairs of shoes produced each year by his firm Adidas  are made in low-cost Asia. That could soon change as cheaper, faster and more flexible robots mean manufacturing - including producing fiddly footwear - could be brought closer to consumers in high-wage countries like Germany, speeding up delivery and slashing freight costs in what some call a fourth industrial revolution. Adidas is working with the German government, academics and robotics firms on new technologies it hopes will trigger a significant a shift in the footwear industry as the move led by its arch rival Nike to produce in Asia decades ago. The project is part of a broader drive by Adidas to catch up with Nike, which has extended its lead as the world’s biggest sportswear firm in recent years with innovative products such as its “Flyknit” shoes made out of machine-knitted fibre. “We will bring production back to where the main markets are,” Adidas Chief Executive Herbert Hainer said in March. “We will be the leader and the first mover there.” Adidas hopes to be able to produce a custom-made running shoe from scratch in a store in Berlin by next year, using a stitching machine and a foamer to make the sole. Nike, which has long faced criticism for using Asian sweat shops to produce its pricey footwear, is also investing heavily in new manufacturing methods. But it has not yet put a date on when it expects that to result in more U.S.-based production. Key to moving footwear manufacturing closer to Western markets are technologies which cut the need for workers to  piece together shoes. A machine can now “knit” an upper like a sock, robots can already complete more of the final assembly of the shoe, while 3-D printing could soon allow the production of a customised sole. That could threaten millions of jobs in the footwear industry in countries like China, Brazil and Vietnam, but potentially create new positions elsewhere, albeit for more highly skilled labourers working alongside robots. Robots, now used mainly in auto production, could soon cut labour costs by 18 percent or more by 2025 in other sectors, the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) predicts. The new technology is being closely guarded: photographers were not invited to an investor presentation at the Adidas innovation centre, where it demonstrated a robot that could stick its trademark three stripes to a running shoe. Nike, for its part, tried to stop Adidas producing a knitted shoe that it said violated patents for the “Flyknit” technology it launched in 2012. However, a German court ultimately allowed Adidas to resume production of its “Primeknit” shoes. Nike says it can make “Flyknit” shoes with half the labour input of a typical “cut-and-sew” shoe as it has 80 percent fewer components, also resulting in 70 percent less waste as it no longer needs to cut pieces from a pattern and discard the rest. Nike co-founder Philip Knight shook up the sporting goods industry that Adidas has dominated until the 1970s after putting into practice his thesis paper arguing that sneakers from lower-cost Japan could compete with pricier German-made versions. Today, Asia produces 87 percent of all footwear, with China by far the biggest manufacturer, followed by India, Brazil and Vietnam, according to APICCAPS, the association of Portuguese footwear manufacturers that compiles global industry figures. Nike and Adidas each rely on more than 1 million workers in contract factories worldwide to make their shoes. While the need for speed is one motivating factor, rising wage costs, particularly in China, are also driving the shift. “That element is going up dramatically,” said Glenn Bennett, head of global operations for Adidas who leads the project aimed at getting products to shoppers faster than the six weeks needed for shipments to arrive from Asia. Adidas is working with companies like automotive supplier Johnson Controls, robotics experts Manz and knitting machine maker Stoll on new processes as it targets prototype in-store manufacturing by next year. Adidas says more local manufacturing should leave it with less surplus stock it has to discount, helping to lift its operating margin above 10 percent from 6.6 percent in 2014, still behind the 13 percent Nike recorded last year. Nike, which saw sales in North America dampened earlier this year by delays to deliveries from Asia due to labour disruption at ports on the U.S. West Coast, is unlikely to allow its German rival to get much of a headstart on localised production. During a visit by U.S. President Barack Obama to Nike headquarters last month, the firm promised to create 10,000 jobs in the United States in the next decade by producing more in its home market if a trade deal with Asian countries is approved. “We are putting a lot of money and a lot of resources against how our supply chain evolves to increase speed and make sure we deliver to consumers as quickly and innovatively as we can,” Trevor Edwards, Nike brand president, said in March. Beyond knitting and 3-D printing, other innovations helping to speed up production include bonding and gluing technologies to fuse together fabrics as well as waterless dyeing which allows pigments to penetrate textiles more quickly. Yves-Simon Gloy, an expert from the Institute for Textile Technology at Aachen University who is collaborating with Adidas and sees the dawning of a fourth industrial revolution due to the emergence of “cyber physical systems”, machines equipped with sensors, cameras and motors that can be adjusted using the Internet in real time. But Bennett and Gloy do not expect these smart machines to completely usurp human workers. “The breakthrough will probably happen in finishing the product close to the consumer,” said Bennett. “Not moving the whole of the operation”.

397,NKE,Adidas to grow soccer sales by getting back to roots,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German sportswear firm Adidas presented plans on Wednesday to defend its position as the world’s top soccer brand against fierce competition from Nike by launching a new range of footwear and setting up more grassroots programs. Adidas said it aims to increase sales from soccer gear at a mid-single-digit rate annually on average from 2015 to 2020 on a currency-neutral basis. That is lower than the “high-single-digit” growth rate it set for group sales in March and reflects the challenges it faces from U.S. rival Nike. The two companies dominate a soccer kit industry worth more than $5 billion a year, sharing more than 80 percent of the market for many products. But Nike has been threatening Adidas’ leadership, including in its home territory of western Europe. Adidas, which saw the 2014 World Cup help boost its soccer sales by more than 20 percent to 2.1 billion euros ($2.35 billion), said it would do more to connect with a broader range of players with permanent or temporary grassroots programs. “Soccer still starts on the street. This is where the kids get in touch with the sport,” Adidas soccer head Markus Baumann told analysts, noting that 226 million unregistered soccer players worldwide dwarfed the 30 million registered. Adidas is setting up soccer centers in key cities around the world with a focus on street players, including different kinds of pitches, shoot-out areas, lounges and bars. In the professional game, Baumann said Adidas would focus on the top three soccer leagues in the world - in England, Germany and Spain - as well as the top 25 clubs. Adidas last year struck a record shirt deal with former British champions Manchester United, ousting Nike. It will also replace Nike at Italian champions Juventus this summer and has extended an outfitting deal with Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich. The U.S. company, however, has struck deals with many other top clubs and players. Adidas has faced calls to end its support for FIFA due to the corruption scandal engulfing soccer’s world governing body. But Baumann said the company has no intention of changing its contracts with FIFA and Europe’s soccer authority UEFA in the next couple of years, noting that both are long-term contracts.  However, Baumann said that when contracts come up for renegotiation, Adidas would consider how influential this kind of partnership is to its target consumer. It is focusing on boosting sales of footwear rather than apparel, and this month scrapped its four established soccer shoe brands and launched two new ones, the “X” and “ACE”. Baumann said marketing of the new shoes, which respond to a new footballing philosophy which divides players into those specializing in control and those who bring unpredictability and speed to the game, had already reached 40 million consumers. Adidas also set a target to double currency-neutral sales from its running business from 2015 to 2020 by connecting with local communities of runners and focusing on the North American market, where it hopes for significant market share gains. Mirroring its approach in soccer, Adidas plans to set up bases in Boston, Los Angeles and New York to showcase products and services for urban runners, particularly its lightweight Boost shoes which it hopes will sell 15 million pairs this year. It will also be designing more running shoes specifically for the U.S. market, helped by a new footwear design studio in Brooklyn to be staffed by three former Nike shoe experts. Further, Adidas hopes to increase sales from its sports-inspired fashion brand Originals by 50 percent by 2020. Adidas made sales of 1.5 billion euros in running in 2014 and 2.6 billion from Originals.

Adidas said it aims to increase sales from football gear at a mid-single-digit rate annually on average from 2015 to 2020 on a currency-neutral basis.

400,NKE,Nike beats estimates again as demand shows no sign of abating,"(Reuters) - Nike Inc (NKE.N), the world’s largest footwear maker, reported a better-than-expected profit for the eighth quarter in a row as it sold more high-margin shoes and apparel at higher prices, and posted a surprise rise in growth of “futures orders”. The company also raised its sales growth forecast for the current fiscal year, helping send its shares up 3.3 percent to $108.70 in extended trading on Thursday. Nike’s orders for delivery from June through November, a gauge of demand it calls “futures orders”, rose 13 percent excluding currency fluctuations at the end of the fourth quarter. Analysts on average were expecting futures orders growth to slow to 10.4 percent from 11 percent at the end of the third quarter, according to Consensus Metrix. “Extremely impressive across the board,” said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough. “It’s almost mind-boggling how a company this big can post numbers this impressive year in and year out.” Yarbrough attributed Nike’s growth to trendy products and a lack of strong competition. Nike’s higher-margin Jordan, LeBron and Kobe basketball shoe brands have been especially popular in the United States, making it the company’s fastest growing footwear business. Sales of running shoes, Nike’s biggest footwear business, rose in the quarter, easing concerns of slowing demand. Nike said sales of higher priced merchandise and growth in its direct-to-consumer business helped boost gross margins 60 basis points in the fourth quarter ended May 31. The same factors are expected to boost margins by 50 basis points in the current quarter, Chief Financial Officer Don Blair said on a conference call.

The Dow closed higher, boosted by strong results from component Nike Inc, while the Nasdaq ended solidly lower on disappointing results from Micron Technology Inc, which weighed on chipmakers like Intel. In Europe, Greece rejected a five-month extension of bailouts on Friday, a day before euro zone finance ministers will meet to decide the country’s fate. Greece needs fresh funds to avoid defaulting on a $1.8 billion debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund on June 30. If it defaults, it may have to leave the euro or the European Union, potentially shaking the region’s economic foundations. “If this issue gets resolved, then we’re set up for a fairly decent market, but it could be that everything falls apart on the 30th,” said James Meyer, chief investment officer at Tower Bridge Advisers in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. “Market valuation is high in an absolute sense.” Nike rose 4.3 percent to $109.71 and was the biggest boost to the Dow after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, lifted as it sold more high-margin shoes and apparel at higher prices. Micron Technology sank 18 percent to $19.66 a day after forecasting a further decline in prices of chips used in personal computers. It also gave a revenue outlook for the current quarter that was well below market estimates.  The PHLX Semiconductor index fell 2.4 percent. Intel Corp fell 3 percent to $31.02. In the latest economic data, University of Michigan’s final reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment for June was 96.1, higher than the preliminary reading of 94.6.

The German group said on Wednesday it had completed the acquisition from majority owner Axel Springer SE, along with the company’s founders and an “angel” investor, in a deal valuing the Austrian company at 220 million euros ($239 million). Rival Nike Inc was a pioneer in fitness tracking, teaming up with Apple Inc on the Nike+ running programmes for the iPod and iPhone and launching the FuelBand in 2012. Adidas has been losing market share in sporting goods to its bigger U.S. rival and launched its own miCoach fitness device only last year. Fast-growing Under Armour Inc, which last year overtook Adidas as the second-biggest sportswear maker in the United States, earlier this year bought diet and exercise app MyFitnessPal for $475 million and social fitness network Endomondo for $85 million.

409,NKE,UPDATE 4-Adidas considers giving up golf as cycling booms,"* Q2 sales ahead of consensus forecast * Golf sales slump 26 pct, worsen from Q1 * Adidas launches new round of restructuring for golf * Robust momentum in other units seen for H2 * Shares up 0.9 pct   (Adds background) By Emma Thomasson and Jörn Poltz LONDON/MUNICH, Aug 6 (Reuters) - German sportswear company Adidas has appointed investment bank Guggenheim Partners to help with the possible sale of its golf brands, which are struggling as the sport loses popularity, particularly in the United States. Adidas made the announcement on Thursday as deteriorating golf sales overshadowed otherwise strong second-quarter results, boosted by double-digit sales growth in both western Europe and China, which it expects to continue for the rest of the year. After peaking around 2000 when Tiger Woods was in his prime, the number of U.S. golfers has been steadily falling as fewer young people take up the sport and as busy professionals switch to cycling rather than spending the best part of a day playing 18 holes. Adidas bought the TaylorMade brand in 1997 along with Salomon, developing it into the world’s biggest golf supplier. It acquired the Ashworth brand in 2008 for $72.8 million and the Adams brand for $70 million four years later. Investors have criticised Adidas for responding too slowly to the declining popularity of the sport, flooding the market with new products that it then had to discount heavily. Golf sales fell to about 6 percent of sales in 2014, forcing the group to warn on profits several times, while Adidas is not a major player in the booming business for high-end bicyles. Chief Executive Herbert Hainer admitted that two new golf clubs - the R15 and the AeroBurner drivers - had not sold well and competitors had been raising their game, but said he had high hopes for another new club which it will be launching soon. He told reporters on a conference call that Adidas was initially looking into the possible sale of its smaller golf brands Adams and Ashworth, which have suffered most in the downturn, although it was considering all options for the main TaylorMade label for which it also announced a turnaround plan. The number of people playing golf in the United States, which accounts for about half the global golf market, has fallen to an estimated 23 million from nearly 30 million in 2000, with the number of courses declining for the past eight years. The Professional Golfers’ Association (PGA) is trying to market the sport to youngsters and make the game more family-friendly and Hainer said the number of golf rounds played had reversed their downwards trend recently. But that has yet to be reflected in sales of Adidas golf equipment. In the second quarter the firm’s golf sales fell by a currency-adjusted 26 percent, accelerating a 9 percent decline in the previous three months. Other companies in the golf market include Nike, Kering’s Puma  and Callaway Golf. The company formerly known as Fortune Brands sold its golf business in 2011 for $1.2 billion to a group led by Fila Korea and Korean private equity fund Mirae Asset Private Equity. Despite the slump in golf Adidas group sales rose in the last quarter by 15 percent to 3.91 billion euros ($4.27 billion) or 5 percent excluding the impact of currencies, beating an average of analysts’ forecasts of 3.8 billion euros. Adidas shares, which are up 31 percent this year helped by a stock buyback and improving sales, were up 0.8 percent at 1217 GMT, outperforming a flat German blue-chip index. Hainer said he expected robust momentum to continue in the second half, citing a strong order book and “unprecedented” demand for Manchester United kit launched on Saturday after it displaced Nike as new suppliers to the English side. He said the weak performance of the golf business would not put the group’s 2015 targets at risk. Adidas has already overhauled top management at the golf business and launched a restructuring programme last year, but Hainer said a more radical overhaul of the business was needed, including a review of marketing and production and more cost cutting.

Under Armour said it expects sales to grow as it expands into new markets such as Indonesia, Brunei and Vietnam, and innovates in its footwear business. International sales are expected to account for 18 percent of total sales by 2018, the company said, up from 9 percent in 2014. Under Armor has been quick to cash in on the new trend of “athleisure,” a mash-up of athletic and casual clothing seen even in formal settings like offices. That, along with the recent successes of sports stars such as golfer Jordan Spieth and basketball star Stephen Curry, have helped it race past Wall Street’s estimates in the past few quarters and overtake Adidas AG as the second biggest U.S. footwear maker. Sales in its most recent quarter rose 29 percent to $783.6 million, topping the analysts’ average estimate of $761.5 million. Plank also said sales were outpacing internal growth forecasts, helping the company achieve its previously announced $4 billion target for 2016, a year earlier. Under Armour’s shares have risen 52.2 percent this year, compared with the Standard & Poor’s 500 index’s 3.09 percent decline.

413,NKE,Nike sprints ahead as high-margin products sales rise,"(Reuters) - Nike Inc (NKE.N) reported a better-than-expected profit for the ninth straight quarter as the world’s largest sportswear maker sold more products at higher prices and benefited from increased sales in its owned stores and internet business. Shares of the company, already up 19 percent this year, rose 7.5 percent in extended trading after it also posted a better-than-expected rise in “futures orders” growth. New footwear launches in the basketball, running, and sports categories are helping Nike draw customers toward higher-priced products and its direct-to-consumer (DTC) channel, while the “athleisure” trend is driving sales of athletic apparel. The push drove a 90 basis-point increase in gross margins to 47.5 percent in the first quarter ended Aug. 31. The company has also managed to gain traction among younger customers by leveraging social media and its mobile apps.  Investments in product innovation and gathering feedback and data on customers’ fitness activities are also helping Nike get ahead of its rivals, Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said, calling the first-quarter results “extremely impressive”.  The company’s orders scheduled for delivery from September through January, a gauge of demand it calls “worldwide futures orders”, rose 17 percent, excluding currency changes, at the end of the first quarter. Analysts on average had expected futures orders growth to slow to 10.3 percent from 13 percent at the end of the fourth quarter, according to Consensus Metrix. Nike said futures orders grew 27 percent in China, excluding currency changes, versus analysts’ estimates of a 15.8 percent rise. Revenue from North America, Nike’s largest market, rose 8 percent.

The Nasdaq fell 1 percent, while the Nasdaq Biotech Index  tumbled 5.1 percent and retested its low from August, when it entered bear market territory. The Dow ended solidly in positive territory, helped by shares of Nike, which hit a record high after its profit topped expectations on strong China growth. The stock, up 8.9 percent at $125, gave the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P; 500. The market started the day higher after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen late Thursday said she and other Fed policymakers do not expect recent economic and financial market turmoil to significantly alter the U.S. central bank’s policy, easing concerns about the world’s economic health.  She said she expects interest rates to be raised this year. The declines in the biotech index extended this week’s drop to 13 percent, its biggest weekly decline in seven years. On Monday, U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said she would announce a plan to stop “price gouging” for specialty drugs, sparking a drop in the shares. The S&P; 500 health care index was down 2.7 percent, leading the decline in the S&P; 500 while the S&P; financial index  was up 1.5 percent. “Biotechs had been an area that had been doing really well so it could be as the market has gotten worse that people are selling stuff that’s less painful to sell. Valuations were pretty stretched,” said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management Corp. in Chicago. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 113.35 points, or 0.7 percent, to 16,314.67, the S&P; 500 lost 0.9 points, or 0.05 percent, to 1,931.34 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 47.98 points, or 1.01 percent, to 4,686.50. Markets have been skittish since last Thursday, when Yellen cited concerns about slowing global growth as a key reason for holding off from a much-anticipated rate hike. For the week, the Dow was down 0.4 percent, the S&P; 500 was down 1.4 percent and the Nasdaq was down 2.9 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,587 to 1,459, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,907 issues fell and 920 advanced for a 2.07-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The S&P; 500 posted six new 52-week highs and 17 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 41 new highs and 179 new lows. About 7.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 7.4 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Nike’s surprisingly strong results in China pushed its shares up nearly 10 percent to a record high, giving the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P.; Data showing that the U.S. economy expanded more than previously estimated in the second quarter added to the positive tone and backed the case for a rate hike before the end of 2015. Yellen said on Thursday that she and other policymakers do not expect recent global economic and financial market developments to significantly affect the Fed’s policy. Nine of the 10 major S&P; sectors were higher, led by the financial index’s 1.54 percent gain - its biggest in 2-1/2 weeks. “Yellen’s speech gave a little bit of clarity to the markets,” said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. “That put the market in a slightly better mindset. It understands what the Fed is going to be doing because the last FOMC meeting had left people scratching their heads.” Federal fund futures contracts showed traders were pricing in more than a 50 percent chance of a rate hike by the end of this year. At 10:57 a.m. ET (1457 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was up 202.17 points, or 1.25 percent, at 16,403.49. The S&P; 500 was up 16.79 points, or 0.87 percent, at 1,949.03 and the Nasdaq composite was up 32.02 points, or 0.68 percent, at 4,766.50. Markets have been skittish since last Thursday, when Yellen cited concerns about slowing global growth as a key reason for holding off from a much-anticipated hike. Since then, the S&P; 500 had fallen about 3 percent through Thursday’s close. The CBOE Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, fell 6.9 percent to 21.84, but remained above its long-term average of 20. Data on Friday showed stronger construction and consumer spending helped U.S. gross domestic product rise at a 3.9-percent annual pace in the April-June quarter, up from the 3.7-percent pace reported last month. Consumer sentiment rose to 87.2 in September, better than the median forecast of 86.7. Nike jumped 9.6 percent to a record high of $125.82 after its quarterly profit topped expectations on strong growth in China. Bank of America, JPMorgan, Citigroup  and Wells Fargo were up between 2.0 percent and 2.6 percent. Apple was up 0.5 percent at $115.61 as its new iPhones went on sale on Friday. Pier 1 Imports slumped 19.2 percent to a 5-year low of $7 after the home decor and furniture importer’s results missed expectations.

Nike Inc said on Wednesday it expects revenue to increase 63 percent to $50 billion by fiscal 2020, boosted by growth in its e-commerce, women’s and Jordan brand businesses. The sportswear maker’s revenue increased 52.2 percent, or $10.5 billion, in the past five years to hit $30.6 billion in the year ended May 2015. Nike forecast sales in the women’s business would almost double, topping $11 billion in 2020 from $5.7 billion in 2015. “Our women’s business today is outpacing our men’s business on dotcom. So it gives us a great indication that more women want access to our brand,” Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards told Reuters while at the company’s investor meeting. The company’s e-commerce business, which brings in just over $1 billion per year, is expected to grow to $7 billion by 2020. Nike, co-founded by Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman in 1964, has raced ahead of No.1 rival Adidas, while fending off smaller rivals such as Under Armour Inc. Nike’s revenue is expected to rise 39 percent over the next four years, while Adidas’s is expected to rise 33.3 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Under Armor last month forecast revenue would more than double to $7.5 billion by 2018, though off a much smaller base. Nike is also expanding its Jordan business beyond being a predominantly U.S.-based and basketball brand, and sees strong growth potential in western Europe and China, said Edwards, a 23-year Nike veteran. The company expects revenue from the business to grow to $4.5 billion by 2020. Edwards said revenue in the business had doubled over the last few years, but declined to give details. Nike’s sales in China rose 30 percent in the three months ended August, while most other retailers struggled. Edwards said demand in China had not slowed and that he expects growth there to continue at a “pretty significant pace”. “With China, one of the things that continues to be a great driver in the market certainly for us is the middle class continues to grow ... and they continue to be excited and passionate about sport.” Nike’s shares closed flat at $125.84 on Wednesday. The stock is up nearly 31 percent this year, the best performer among the 30 companies on the Dow Jones industrial average.

426,NKE,Adidas to intensify marketing drive as U.S. sales rebound,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German sportswear company Adidas (ADSGn.DE), trying to muscle into Nike’s (NKE.N) home territory, plans to increase spending on marketing again after high-profile sponsorship deals and celebrity partnerships helped rekindle U.S. sales. Adidas said it would seek to build on its momentum by lifting promotional spending further in the run-up to Christmas.  The firm had said it would spend 13-14 percent of sales on marketing this year, compared with 10-11 percent for most rivals. The world’s second-biggest sportswear firm has scored with “Yeezy” sneakers designed by Kanye West and soccer kit for Manchester United (MANU.N) and Italian champions Juventus launched this summer after it displaced Nike as new suppliers to both teams. After slipping last year into third place in the U.S. market behind Nike and fast-growing Under Armour (UA.N), Adidas has made a big push in North American sports, agreeing a partnership with the National Hockey League (NHL) and sponsorship deals with top NHL and National Football League (NFL) players. Adidas will seek to capitalize on those deals as well as launching a major basketball campaign, Chief Executive Herbert Hainer told a conference call for journalists. Its campaign for the 2016 European soccer championship will start next week when it launches the new German national team jersey. Third-quarter sales of 4.76 billion euros ($5.17 billion) were up 18 percent, or 13 percent excluding the impact of currencies, beating an average analyst forecast for 4.5 billion euros and accelerating from 5 percent the previous quarter.  Attributable net income rose 10 percent to 311 million euros, ahead of consensus forecasts for 306 million.

It is back to gain market share even in the United States,” said Kelper Cheuvreux analyst Jurgen Kolb. Adidas said currency-neutral sales in North America rose 6 percent, after a flat first half, driven by double-digit sales growth for the core Adidas brand, the fastest pace since 2011. Adidas raised its full-year outlook for sales and profits and said it should be able to repeat the performance next year, forecasting that currency-neutral sales and operating profit should both rise at a high-single-digit rate. “We are winning big time. Both Adidas and Reebok are enjoying great momentum across the globe,” Hainer said, referring to the company’s other main brand. However, higher marketing spending and currency effects look set to keep a lid on the operating margin, which Adidas said should stay flat in 2016 after a forecast 6.5-7 percent in 2015, far from the 13.6 percent Nike recorded for the year to end-May. Hainer said a strategic review of the company’s TaylorMade golf business should be completed in the first quarter of 2016, adding that it has already attracted potential bidders. In the meantime, Adidas will keep working to restructure the unit, suffering from sport’s declining popularity, and would cut its global staff by 14 percent by the end of the year, which would incur a small hit to group profits in the fourth quarter.

The company’s shares ran up as much as 10 percent in morning trading on Friday. The upbeat report also pushed up shares of Nike Inc, Under Armour Inc and VF Corp - all major suppliers to Foot Locker, one of the biggest footwear retailers in the United States. Foot Locker’s results contrasted with those of Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc and Hibbett Sports Inc, which have cut their full-year same-store sales forecasts, citing weak demand for footwear and apparel. “Foot Locker is clearly taking share from Finish Line  and Hibbett and likely many others and continues to prove that it is the best-in-class athletic specialty retailer,” Sterne Agee CRT analyst Sam Poser wrote in a note. Finish Line reports next month. Foot Locker said its same-store sales rose 8.7 percent in the three months ended Oct. 31. Analysts on average had expected growth of 6.1 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Demand for new running shoe styles such as Adidas AG’s  ZX Flux, Puma’s Creepers and Nike’s Air Huarache, Roshe One and Air Force 1 lines drove Foot Locker’s U.S. sales in the quarter, Chief Executive Dick Johnson said on a call. Puma SE is controlled by French luxury goods company Kering SA. Foot Locker also said demand was strong for basketball shoes including Nike’s Kyrie 1 and Jordan lines as well as Under Armour’s Curry 2 sneakers and boots from VF Corp’s Timberland. The company said it expects profit per share to grow by a double-digit percentage rate in the current quarter. Analysts on average expect fourth-quarter profit to increase by 10 percent to $1.11 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Foot Locker’s net income fell to $80 million, or 57 cents per share, in the latest quarter from $120 million, or 82 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1 per share. Revenue rose 3.6 percent to $1.79 billion. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 95 cents per share and revenue of $1.78 billion. Foot Locker’s shares were up 5.5 percent at $66.90 in late morning trading. Up to Thursday’s close, the stock had risen about 10 percent this year.

435,NKE,Coe quits ambassadorial role with Nike,"MONACO (Reuters) - Sebastian Coe is stepping down from his ambassadorial role with Nike, the IAAF president said on Thursday.  Coe, who leads the ruling body of world athletics, has worked as a paid ambassador for the sportswear firm but faced repeated questions about a potential conflict of interest. An internal Nike email leaked this week appeared to show him supporting the bid of Eugene, the U.S. city with close links to the company, to host the 2021 world athletics championships.  Coe also announced that CSM, the sports marketing firm he heads, will not tender for any contracts that might lead to allegations of a conflict of interest.   The Briton also said he was stepping down as chair of the British Olympic Association (BOA) after next year’s Rio Games. “I have sought advice from the IAAF’s Ethics Committee to review my interests and was told I could retain my positions in Nike and CSM as long as I do not seek to influence any decisions that could influence them,” Coe said at a news conference following an IAAF Council meeting.  “I’m grateful for that advice but it is clear that perception and reality have become horribly mangled.  “I’ve made the following decisions: I’ve stepped down from my ambassadorial role with Nike which lasted 38 years. The current noise level around it is not good for Nike or the IAAF and is a distraction.” Coe’s relationship with Nike was thrust deeper under the spotlight this week when he faced fresh allegations about his involvement in the controversial award of the 2021 world championships to Eugene.   In April this year the hosting rights were surprisingly awarded without a bidding process, much to the surprise of the Swedish city of Gothenburg that was in the process of preparing to present its own case. The then-president of the IAAF (the International Association of Athletics Federations), Lamine Diack, supported the idea to give Eugene hosting rights.  But in the light of the 82-year-old being investigated by French authorities over a doping corruption scandal, many observers questioned the validity and transparency of the decision. On Tuesday the BBC published internal emails it said it obtained from Nike that suggested Coe gave support to the U.S. city’s bid. The emails raised questions about whether there was a conflict of interests in Coe, who succeeded Diack as IAAF chief in August, supporting Eugene’s bid given his links to Nike.

Coe, who became head of the ruling body of world athletics in August, has been associated with Nike for nearly 40 years but  has repeatedly rejected such accusations. However, as the athletics world battles a succession of doping and corruption issues, the situation clearly became untenable, the former Olympic track star said. “I’ve made the following decisions: I’ve stepped down from my ambassadorial role with Nike which lasted 38 years. The current noise level around it is not good for Nike or the IAAF and is a distraction,” Coe told a news conference following an IAAF Council meeting. Coe said he had sought advice from the IAAF’s Ethics Committee and was told he could retain his position in Nike and sports marketing firm CSM as long as he did not seek to influence any decisions which could have an impact on them. “I’m grateful for that advice but it is clear that perception and reality have become horribly mangled,” he said. Coe also announced that CSM will not tender for any contracts that might lead to allegations of a conflict of interest. The British double Olympic 1500 metres champion also said he was stepping down as chair of the British Olympic Association (BOA) after next year’s Rio Games. Pressure had been building on Coe over the issue for several months but the final straw appeared to come this week when a leaked internal Nike email appeared to show him supporting the bid of Eugene, the U.S. city with close links to the company, to host the 2021 world athletics championships. In April this year the hosting rights were awarded without a bidding process, much to the surprise of the Swedish city of Gothenburg which was in the process of preparing to present its own case. Coe said on Thursday that his communication with the Eugene bid committee was completely above board and consisted of him merely encouraging them to bid for the event, having missed out to Doha for the 2019 edition. He said that there had been no strong call for him to walk away from Nike while running the London 2012 Olympics but accepted in the light of the crisis currently engulfing his sport that it had become a distraction. “I don’t believe it was a conflict of interest,” he said. “I always declared it, and a range of others, but I just felt I needed to focus unflinchingly on the challenges ahead with my colleagues.” Coe also said he had made the decision before the release of the Nike email this week but wanted to wait to meet his Council colleagues face-to-face before announcing the decision. He is reported to earn around 100,000 pounds annually from Nike, and has been a hugely successful businessman since retiring from the track but his IAAF presidency is an upaid role — something that might be changed in the future. “Considering what Seb has given up the athletes want someone at the top to be paid to deliver professional services for the sport,” said former Namibian sprinter Frankie Fredericks, a Council member and head of the IAAF Athletes’ Commission. The issue dominated Thursday’s news conference, with little time allocated to Russia’s suspension over a doping scandal and  its chances of cleaning up its act in time to compete in next year’s Olympics. Earlier on Thursday Russian athletics officials said they would not be appealing against the suspension and would work with the IAAF and the World Anti-Doping Agency on a “pathway to re-admittance”.

438,NKE,Coe quits ambassadorial role with Nike,"MONACO (Reuters) - Sebastian Coe is stepping down from his ambassadorial role with Nike, the IAAF president said on Thursday.  Coe, who leads the ruling body of world athletics, has worked as a paid ambassador for the sportswear firm but faced repeated questions about a potential conflict of interest. An internal Nike email leaked this week appeared to show him supporting the bid of Eugene, the U.S. city with close links to the company, to host the 2021 world athletics championships.  Coe also announced that CSM, the sports marketing firm he heads, will not tender for any contracts that might lead to allegations of a conflict of interest.

The current noise level around it is not good for Nike or the IAAF and is a distraction.” Coe’s relationship with Nike was thrust deeper under the spotlight this week when he faced fresh allegations about his involvement in the controversial award of the 2021 world championships to Eugene.   In April this year the hosting rights were surprisingly awarded without a bidding process, much to the surprise of the Swedish city of Gothenburg that was in the process of preparing to present its own case. The then-president of the IAAF (the International Association of Athletics Federations), Lamine Diack, supported the idea to give Eugene hosting rights.  But in the light of the 82-year-old being investigated by French authorities over a doping corruption scandal, many observers questioned the validity and transparency of the decision. On Tuesday the BBC published internal emails it said it obtained from Nike that suggested Coe gave support to the U.S. city’s bid. The emails raised questions about whether there was a conflict of interests in Coe, who succeeded Diack as IAAF chief in August, supporting Eugene’s bid given his links to Nike.

439,NKE,Adidas CEO says to stay until end of contract in 2017,"* Board launched search for new CEO in February * Investors satisfied, particularly like Adidas core brand-CEO * Hainer says order books not been so full for 15 years * CEO expects double-digit 2016 Adidas sales in N.America By Emma Thomasson HERZOGENAURACH, Germany, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Adidas  Chief Executive Herbert Hainer plans to stay until the end of his contract in March 2017 even though the board is looking for a successor, saying he expects bumper sales in his last full year in office. Hainer has been in his job since 2001 as the longest-serving boss of a German blue-chip and early last year the Adidas board extended his contract to 2017. But he has come under fire after the sportswear group lost market share to Nike and suffered from falling golf sales and its exposure to Russia. In February, the board said it had launched a search for a successor. Since then the pressure on Hainer has abated as Adidas’s sales have rebounded in the important U.S. market. At a news briefing, Hainer said much had changed and he was upbeat for 2016, noting that the share price had risen 60 percent in the last year, to make it one of the strongest performers in the German DAX index. “I have never seen the order books as full in my 15 years here,” Hainer said. “I am extremely optimistic as I know what we’ve sold for the first six months (of 2016).” Hainer said he did not feel under pressure from high-profile new investors the world’s second biggest sportswear brand has attracted in the last year, saying he met with them regularly. “Investors are all satisfied,” he said. “What all really like is the Adidas brand. It is such a strong brand and it has such a sheen. That is what really interests them.” Reuters reported last week that Egyptian tycoon Nassef Sawiris has formed a partnership with U.S. investor Mason Hawkins and his colleagues at Southeastern Asset Management to drive change at companies including Adidas. The new entity plans to build stakes in up to 10 European companies it deems to be underperforming to spur boardroom revamps and influence strategy, one source said. Although Adidas shares are up strongly this year, they still trade at a discount to Nike. But Hainer is not in any hurry to step down, saying the board is taking its time to consider external candidates as well as internal ones. “Of course I will stay until the end of my contract,” he said, adding he had doubled sales and profit at Adidas in the last decade. “At some point an announcement will come and then we will see how quickly the person can come.” Hainer repeated his rejection of calls from some investors for Adidas to sell the long-struggling Reebok fitness brand he bought in 2006, saying the business was now growing at double-digit rates everywhere except in North America. He also denied a media report that Adidas was preparing to sell its ice hockey equipment business, saying there was no current sales process although there were always people interested in the business. After slipping last year into third place in the U.S. market behind Nike and fast-growing Under Armour, Adidas has hiked marketing spending in North America by 50 percent in the first nine months of the year, Hainer said. Hainer said he expected the core Adidas brand to grow by 10 percent or more in North America in 2016, up from 8 percent in the first nine months of 2015, while sales of football kit should also rise at a double digit rate. North America is Adidas’s second biggest market in terms of sales after Western Europe, based on third quarter sales.   (Reporting by Emma Thomasson.

443,NKE,Top 2015 U.S. stock funds stay defensive heading into 2016,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top stock-picking fund managers won 2015 by aiming for brand name companies and avoiding the sector bets that brought down biotech and energy investors. Now, as they look ahead to 2016, these active investors expect to be even more defensive, picking companies like Hersheys Co and General Electric that they say will be able to weather the combination of slow global growth and the first U.S. interest rate hike in a nearly decade. “We’re looking for companies that have some competitive advantage that makes them the standard in their industry,” said Dennis Lynch, a co-portfolio manager of both the Morgan Stanley Institutional Advantage fund and the Morgan Stanley Institutional Growth Portfolio fund - the fifth and sixth best performing large cap funds of this year with returns of 11.5 percent through Monday’s close. Lynch’s Institutional Advantage fund, for instance, added positions in consumer companies including Hershey, Estee Lauder Companies Inc and Colgate-Palmolive Co in the quarter ending Sept. 30.  These types of consumer companies with strong brands tend to withstand volatile markets, Lynch said. At the same time, he trimmed positions in top holdings Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc that rallied this year. Other active fund managers that are looking for big names with lots of downside protection in 2015 include Daniel Davidowitz, co-portfolio manager of the $804 million Polen Growth fund - the year’s top performer in the large cap category - and Douglas Rao, portfolio manager of the $2.4 billion Janus Forty fund.  “There’s a lot of noise and volatility in the market right now, and we’re in the position of trying to find companies that are less sensitive to the macro environment,” said Rao. Rao’s fund gained 10.7 percent for the year through Monday, a performance that was the 10th best among large-cap funds tracked by Lipper during a time when only 24 percent of large-cap funds have been able to outperform the 0.1 percent gain in the index this year, according to Lipper data. Much of Rao’s performance came from his top holding, Google parent Alphabet Inc, which has gained 44 percent for the year to date, and Amazon, which more than doubled this year and accounts for his 8th-largest position. Yet Rao is not searching for the next stock to hit out the lights in 2016. Instead, he expects GE to once again outperform in the coming year as it sheds its GE Capital assets faster than analysts expect and turns more of its focus to segments such as expanding its line of industrial software.  “The fact is that we have an opportunity to build a position in what we think will be a best of breed industrial company during a period where the U.S. is going through an industrial recession,” he said. The Polen fund is aiming straight at all-weather stocks: All  20 companies in its portfolio generate high levels of cash flow, return 20 percent or more on capital and show increasing profit margins and organic revenue growth.  Along with Facebook, Adobe was the only company Davidowitz added this year to his portfolio, which bested all large-cap funds tracked by Lipper with a gain of 13.4 percent through Monday. Much of that performance came from top holding Nike Inc, which has gained 36.4 percent for the year to date, along with large positions in Starbucks Corp - up 45.6 percent - and Visa Inc, up 17.7 percent.  “We aren’t built to try to take advantage of rate hikes or oil prices or anything like that,” he said. “We want companies like Adobe where it is hard for a competitor to pull their customers away.” That approach may be especially important in the year to come. Since 1945, the benchmark S&P; 500 has gained an average of 4.5 percent over the 12 months following the first rate hike of a business cycle, or about half of the 8.8 percent average gain for the index among all years, according to data from S&P; Capital IQ. “There’s an old saying that when seas get rough sailors prefer a larger boat, and we may have investors gravitating toward larger-cap companies because they expect even rougher seas ahead,” said Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S&P; Capital IQ.

The results in China defy a broader economic slowdown that has been a cause for concern among other retailers. Nike’s second-quarter revenue came in below expectations due to weak demand in Western Europe and Japan and the effect of a stronger dollar. Revenue rose 4.1 percent to $7.69 billion.

Sports Direct said it now held 11.5 percent of Iconix Brand Group Inc and 2.3 percent of retailer Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc through a share instrument. The group appears to want to gain exposure to the U.S. market, having previously been focused on acquisitions in Europe, where it runs 257 stores across the continent plus 455 in Britain. “The main rationale for these stakes is to allow Sports Direct to hopefully build a relationship and develop commercial partnerships with the relevant parties,” the company said in a statement on Wednesday. Dick’s operates 645 stores across the U.S., selling brands such as Nike Inc and Under Armour, while Iconix owns a portfolio of brands including “Mudd”, “Joe Boxer” and “Rocawear”. For years, Sports Direct’s cheap prices fuelled rapid growth but investor confidence in the group, founded and majority owned by Mike Ashley, has been shaken over the last two months by allegations over the treatment of staff in Britain and a profit warning. Shares in Sports Direct, whose founder Ashley also owns Newcastle United soccer club, traded up 3 percent to 424 pence at 0845 GMT following news of the investments. The stock had lost 44 percent of its value since the beginning of December. Sports Direct’s minority stake buying in Britain has in the past helped it open concessions in Tesco, the country’s biggest supermarket chain, and department store group Debenhams . The group has also had previous investments in key supplier Adidas and continues to own 7 percent in rival British retailer JD Sports.

448,NKE,UPDATE 3-Adidas names Henkel's Rorsted to replace Hainer as CEO,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Adidas (ADSGn.DE) has named Henkel’s (HNKG_p.DE) Kasper Rorsted as its new chief executive, boosting its shares as investors expressed hopes that the Dane has the credentials to boost profits at the German sportswear firm. Rorsted, 53, will leave Henkel in April after eight years at the consumer goods firm and take charge of Adidas on Oct. 1, succeeding Herbert Hainer, 61, who has headed the firm for 15 years as the longest-serving boss of a leading German company. Hainer had come under fire as Adidas has lost market share to Nike (NKE.N), particularly in the key U.S. market, and suffered from falling golf sales and its exposure to Russia, prompting the board to launch a search for a successor. Adidas shares were up 5.8 percent by 1400 GMT, while Henkel was down 4.5 percent. “The share price reaction speaks for itself,” said Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment, which owns a 0.7 percent stake in Adidas. “We welcome the appointment of Mr Rorsted to replace Mr Hainer and hope it means an end to the long dry spell in the profitability of Adidas,” added Speich, who has long been critical of the Adidas CEO. Adidas sales have more than doubled under Hainer but they have failed to match Nike, which forecasts revenue will rise another 63 percent to $50 billion by 2020, compared to the Adidas target of 22 billion euros ($24 billion). Hainer has also struggled to improve profitability, with the Adidas operating margin of 6.6 percent in 2014 still half that of Nike. In contrast, Henkel’s adjusted operating margin rose to almost 16 percent in 2014 from 10 percent in 2008.  Hainer had cultivated potential internal successors,   including brand chief Eric Liedtke, but several investors wanted an outsider who might be more likely to take tough decisions and potentially sell more non-core businesses. Hainer has said he is considering selling the struggling Taylor Made golf business, but has repeatedly rejected calls from some investors to sell the Reebok fitness brand he bought in 2006, saying the business was now growing fast. Reuters reported last year that Egyptian tycoon Nassef Sawiris has formed a partnership with U.S. investor Mason Hawkins and his Southeastern Asset Management to drive boardroom change at companies including Adidas. Southeastern declined to comment on Rorsted’s appointment.  Adidas said Rorsted would join the executive board on Aug. 1 and have a two-month transition period with Hainer during a busy period for the sporting goods industry, just after the European soccer championships and just before the Olympics in Rio. Since Rorsted took over at Henkel in 2008, shares in the maker of Schwarzkopf hair care products and Loctite glue have more than tripled, while its annual sales have grown by more than a third to around 18 billion euros estimated for 2015. Rorsted has a reputation as a dynamic manager with a relentless focus on improving profitability, but, like Hainer at Adidas, faced challenges in the United States, the company’s biggest market, where competition from the likes of Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and Unilever (ULVR.L) is fierce. In response, Rorsted, who says he spends 200 days of the year traveling, has overhauled management in the U.S. market, where Henkel has also launched products popular in Europe - Persil laundry detergent and Schwarzkopf shampoo. Rorsted was widely seen as seeking a new challenge after Henkel last year lost out to to Coty Inc (COTY.N) in a bid to buy hair care firm Wella from Procter & Gamble. Rorsted, who is known as a keen skier and fan of soccer club Bayern Munich, is married with four children and his family already live in Munich, meaning he will have less far to commute to his new job in the northern Bavarian town of Herzogenaurach. He serves on the boards of German media company Bertelsmann, Denmark’s Danfoss and brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR)and, before Henkel, he worked for Hewlett Packard, Compaq and Oracle, living in Germany since 1991. Hans Van Bylen, a Belgian who has worked at Henkel since 1984 and who has headed the beauty care business since 2005, will take over as Henkel CEO on May 1, the company said, adding it would name a successor for Van Bylen in due course.

449,NKE,Nike gets second chance to keep shoe patent in dispute with Adidas,"The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office improperly denied Nike a chance to amend a shoe patent in the face of a challenge to its validity by rival Adidas, a U.S. appeals court said on Thursday, ordering it to take another look at the case. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office interpreted its own precedents too strictly in denying a request by Nike, represented by Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr, to amend its patent claims.

450,NKE,Nike drops boxer Manny Pacquiao after anti-gay comments,"(Reuters) - Nike Inc, the world’s largest sportswear maker, said it had ended its contract with Manny Pacquiao after the Filipino boxer described gays as “worse than animals”. “We find Manny Pacquiao’s comments abhorrent,” a Nike spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement, adding that the company no longer has a relationship with the boxer. Nike's decision comes a day after an online petition was launched urging the company to stop Pacquiao endorsing its products. The petition on change.org has garnered more than 3,000 signatures so far. (chn.ge/1R7F7Nh) Pacquiao, revered in the Philippines for winning world boxing titles in eight different weight classes during his 20-year career, suddenly fell from grace after a 30-second interview on local television about same-sex marriage, which he opposes. “It’s just common sense. Do you see any animals of the same sex mating? Animals are better off, they can distinguish between male and female,” Pacquiao told TV5 on Monday. “Now if men are mating with men and women with women, then they are worse than animals,” he said. The 37-year old congressman, among those favored to win a Senate seat at the May elections based on independent pollsters’ surveys, apologized on Tuesday. “I’m sorry for hurting people by comparing homosexuals to animals. Please forgive me for those I’ve hurt,” Pacquiao said in a video message on his Twitter account. He said he remained against same-sex marriage. Same-sex marriage is not allowed in the Philippines, where more than 80 percent of the 100 million population is Roman Catholic.

453,NKE,"Sharapova fails drug test, Nike suspends ties","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova said on Monday she had failed a drug test at the Australian Open due to a substance she was taking for health issues, leading longtime sponsor Nike to announce it was suspending ties during the investigation. The 28-year-old Sharapova, a five-time grand slam champion and the highest paid woman in sports, will be provisionally suspended starting March 12, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said.  She is the seventh athlete in a month to test positive for meldonium, which is used to treat diabetes and low magnesium, and was only banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) as of January 1. “I made a huge mistake. I let my fans down and I let the sport down,” said Sharapova, a teenage tennis prodigy who became the third-youngest Wimbledon champion. “I take full responsibility for it.” “I know that with this I face consequences and I don’t want to end my career this way. I really hope that I will be given another chance to play this game,” former world number one Sharapova told a news conference in a downtown Los Angeles hotel. Nike, the world’s largest sportswear maker, said it was “saddened and surprised” by the news and released a statement saying it was putting ties on hold with the player.  “We have decided to suspend our relationship with Maria while the investigation continues,” it said.  The ITF’s anti-doping program calls for a four-year suspension for a positive test, but that ban can be reduced in various circumstances, such as for first-time offences or if the player shows no significant fault or negligence.  If a player bears no fault or negligence, there is no suspension.     According to Forbes, she earned $29.5 million in 2015, mostly from endorsements. Sharapova said her family doctor had been giving her mildronate, which is also called meldonium, for 10 years after she frequently became sick, had irregular EKG results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes. “It is very important for you to understand that for 10 years this medicine was not on WADA’s banned list and I had been legally taking the medicine. But on January the first, the rules have changed and meldonium became a prohibited substance.” WADA declined to comment until ITF issues a final decision. Meldonium is used to treat chest pain and heart attacks among other conditions, but some researchers have linked it to increased athletic performance and endurance. It is listed by WADA among its prohibited metabolic modulators, along with insulin, and some researchers say it can also help recovery. It is not approved in the United States but is available in Russia, Latvia and other countries in that region.  Over the past month, Russian cyclist Eduard Vorganov, Russian figure skater Ekaterina Bobrova, Ethiopia-born athletes Endeshaw Negesse and Abeba Aregawi, and Ukraine biathletes Olga Abramova and Artem Tyshchenko have all tested positive for meldonium. Sharapova is the most prominent tennis player to test positive for a banned substance in recent years. Croatia’s Marin Cilic was banned for nine months in 2013 after testing positive for a prohibited stimulant, though the suspension was cut to four months on appeal. Former world number one Martina Hingis retired after receiving a two-year suspension for a positive cocaine test in 2007, though the Swiss denied taking the drug. Last year, the sport banned U.S. player Wayne Odesnik for 15 years after his second doping violation, testing positive for steroids and other banned substances. Sharapova is the biggest name in sport to test positive since New York Yankees baseball slugger Alex Rodriguez was banned for a year in 2013 after using performance-enhancing drugs and American cyclist Lance Armstrong was banned for life from racing in 2012 after a U.S. Anti-Doping investigation. Sharapova, one of the most popular figures in global sports, has long been a favorite with her sponsors. Cosmetics maker Avon Products Inc declined to comment on its endorsements.      Steve Simon, CEO of the Women’s Tennis Association, said in a statement he was saddened to hear the news. “Maria (Sharapova) is a leader and I have always known her to be a woman of great integrity,” he said.  “Nevertheless, as Maria acknowledged, it is every player’s responsibility to know what they put in their body and to know if it is permissible. The WTA will support the decisions reached through this process.”     The news came a day after Sharapova’s management team said she was going to make a “major announcement,” which had many speculating that she was going to announce her retirement from professional tennis. Sharapova, who has struggled with a series of injuries in recent years, has not competed since she lost to Serena Williams in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open in January. Renowned for her never-say-die approach, a gritty baseline game and high-decibel shrieking, Sharapova at 17 became the first Russian woman to win Wimbledon when she beat Serena Williams 6-1 6-4 in the 2004 final. That victory also made her the third-youngest Wimbledon champion, behind only Lottie Dod and Hingis, and the fourth-youngest grand slam winner in the open era after Hingis, Monica Seles and Tracy Austin.

456,NKE,UPDATE 2-Nike's revenue misses as strong dollar weighs,"(Reuters) - Nike Inc (NKE.N), the world’s largest footwear maker, reported quarterly revenue that missed analysts’ estimates as a strong dollar hurt sales from some of its overseas markets. The company’s orders for delivery from March through July in North America, a demand gauge it calls “futures orders”, also fell short of expectations, signaling a slowing pace of growth in its biggest market. Futures orders in the region were up were up 10 percent at the end of the third quarter, while analysts were expecting a 11.6 percent growth, according to Consensus Metrix. The company’s shares fell as much as 6 percent in extended trading on Tuesday.  “Expectations were very high,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said, adding that Nike had been “killing it” for a while. The footwear maker said it expected full-year revenue to grow in the high single digits for the year ending May 2017. This was below the 10 percent growth that analysts were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales of footwear, apparel and sports and athletic equipment in emerging markets fell 8 percent to $879 million. Excluding currency fluctuations, sales in emerging markets rose 11 percent.     However, strong sales in China and North America more than made up for declines in emerging markets. Nike reported a 22.6 percent rise in revenue from China, driven by strong demand for sportswear and running and basketball shoes. The company also benefited from a spurt in demand during the Chinese New Year. Nike’s popular running shoe brands such as Lunar, Free and  Flyknit as well as basketball brands such as Jordan and LeBron helped drive North American sales, which rose 13 percent.      Net income rose 20 percent to $950 million, or 55 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Feb. 29. Revenue rose 7.6 percent to $8.03 billion.  Analysts on average had expected earnings of 48 cents per share, on revenue of $8.20 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s shares were down 5.2 percent at $61.50 in extended trading on Tuesday. They have risen 27 percent over the past 12 months.

469,NKE,Winner takes all in mega soccer shirt deals,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A battle between Adidas and Nike for dominance of the global soccer gear market is driving a steep rise in sponsorship payments to elite clubs - and cutting into the two manufacturers’ profits. Shirt deal inflation is reinforcing the advantage of about a dozen clubs with a global fan base - among them Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two Manchester clubs and Paris Saint Germain. These same clubs benefit from bigger revenues from broadcast rights, helping them pay for the best players. The clubs’ gain comes at Adidas and Nike’s expense. Nike stock dropped this week after Morgan Stanley downgraded it to “equal weight”, primarily on concerns the firm is losing U.S. market share to Adidas and Under Armour, but also citing a profit squeeze from the rising cost of sponsorships. “At the top, it is a pure power struggle between Nike and Adidas,” said Peter Rohlmann, a marketing consultant who advises clubs and federations on such deals. “The costs don’t play a role. They want to keep their competitor out.”     Under the terms of sponsorship deals, the brand pays the clubs for the license to sell replica jerseys and other merchandise. The clubs usually receive a fixed fee, kit for the team, plus royalties of some 10-15 percent of the merchandise sold and performance bonuses if the team wins major trophies. Only the highest-profile clubs, and a few national sides like Brazil and Germany, can shift the millions of shirts that justify deals now worth as much as 100 million euros ($111.58 million) a year. Spanish champions Barcelona are market leaders, selling 3.6 million shirts last season, according to Euromericas agency, followed by Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Manchester United. This top four has negotiated new kit deals with Nike or Adidas in the last two years worth double or triple what they were previously receiving. Champions League winners Real Madrid are demanding a big hike from Adidas. Competition has intensified since Nike took the lead in the market for soccer shoes in 2014, prompting Adidas - long the world’s top soccer brand - to shift strategy to focus its spending on fewer top teams and players. Its biggest win was to oust Nike at Manchester United in a deal worth 75 million pounds ($110 million) a year over a decade. Nike, slipping in the U.S. market after it lost singer Kanye West to Adidas and basketball star Steph Curry to Under Armour, is now retaliating. Its new deal with Barcelona last month hit a new record of up to 155 million euros ($173.66 million). Nike declined to comment for this article. Brand president Trevor Edwards has justified the Barcelona deal by saying the club has millions of fans worldwide, adding that the relationship “extends Nike’s leadership position in soccer”.      Nike has also trumped Adidas at Chelsea, more than doubling the value of the contract. “We think Nike ... is willing to sacrifice margin to keep its stars and sign new ones,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote, noting that deals for Nike and Under Armour are up about 70 percent since 2013. Adidas could be forced to stump up almost half a billion euros a year for its top five soccer deals - almost a quarter of its marketing budget - if it yields to demands from Germany and Real Madrid for more.  “Clubs are becoming increasingly sophisticated,” said Glenn Lovett, head of global strategy at sports data firm Repucom.     “Soccer is the most global sport and this is where you need to be if you want to be a global brand.” Adidas says the high media profile of top teams and players shifts merchandise - particularly in Asia - and also indirectly helps sales of training and running gear. “The top clubs will get more expensive while those that are not so good will have problems,” Chief Executive Herbert Hainer said. He sees a limit of not much above 100 million euros a year for the most expensive contracts. The next tier of clubs are having to make do with much less, opening up opportunities for firms like Puma, Under Armour and New Balance. Fans at Bayer Leverkusen complained after the Bundesliga’s third ranked club only managed to secure around 2 million euros a year with local brand Jako after being dropped by Adidas. Under Armour, which sponsored its first English side in Tottenham Hotspur in 2011, recently took over from Adidas at Southampton for 8 million pounds a year. Puma faces demands for a hike from Leicester City after a fifteen-fold jump in demand for its shirts due to its surprise victory in the Premier League, although the contract - worth just 1 million pounds a year - runs until 2018. With the European championships and Copa America about to start, Nike and Adidas are also competing for national sides. World Cup winners Germany are pushing Adidas to leapfrog Nike’s record contract with Euro 2016 hosts France worth 43 million euros a year.      The brands are also bidding to sign top footballers, with Adidas poaching France and Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba from Nike in March for at least 4 million euros per season. Such deals allow the brands to reinforce club contracts, or undermine those of their rivals: Barcelona’s Lionel Messi wears Adidas shoes with his Nike shirt, while Real Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo does the reverse.

470,NKE,UPDATE 5-Tennis-Sharapova banned for two years by ITF,"LONDON (Reuters) - The career of Russian former world number one Maria Sharapova was in tatters on Wednesday after she was given a two-year ban by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) following her positive test for the banned drug meldonium. In a statement the ITF said the five-times grand slam champion’s ban would be backdated to Jan. 26 this year, meaning her results and prize money from the Australian Open, where she reached the quarter-finals, would be canceled out. Sharapova, 29, said she would appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), describing the punishment as “unfairly harsh”. She said an independent tribunal in London on May 18-19 had found that she had not intentionally violated anti-doping rules. A 33-page report of the tribunal’s findings said: “The ITF accepts that the player did not engage in conduct that she knew constituted an antidoping rule violation,” but it rejected her assertion that there was no “significant” fault on her part. “She was the sole author of her own misfortune,” it said. On its website, the ITF said the ban, which could have been as long as four years, had been backdated due to Sharapova’s “prompt admission” of taking the substance, and would end on midnight of Jan. 25, 2018. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) later issued a short statement saying it would review the decision before deciding whether to use its independent right of appeal to CAS. Sharapova has regularly battled back from serious injuries during her glittering career but the two-year ban means she will not be eligible to play until after the 2018 Australian Open when she will be 30, and raises the question of whether she will ever play again. “If it stands, then I think it will be difficult for her to come back at the same level,” the president of the Russian Tennis Federation, Shamil Tarpishchev, told TASS news agency, calling for the penalty to be reduced.     Meldonium was added to WADA’s list of banned substances at the start of the year after mounting evidence that it boosted blood flow and enhanced athletic performance. Around 180 athletes have tested positive for the drug, manufactured in Latvia and common throughout eastern Europe, since January. Sharapova, the world’s highest-paid female athlete, stunned the sporting world in March when she announced that she had tested positive for meldonium, a component of a product named Mildronate which she has taken since 2006 for health issues. At the time Sharapova, the highest-profile tennis player to fail an anti-doping test, said she had made “a huge mistake” in failing to realize that continuing to take Mildronate would be a violation of the anti-doping code. “The ITF spent tremendous amounts of time and resources trying to prove I intentionally violated the anti-doping rules and the tribunal concluded I did not,” she said on Facebook. The ITF had sought a four-year suspension but the tribunal rejected that, she said. “While the tribunal concluded correctly that I did not intentionally violate the anti-doping rules, I cannot accept an unfairly harsh two-year suspension.” The tribunal found that Sharapova had taken Mildronate before each of her five matches at this year’s Australian Open where she lost to Serena Williams. It rejected Sharapova’s argument that the ITF should have informed her that she and a number of other tennis players had tested positive for meldonium in 2015 before it was added to the banned list. The report also said that Sharapova had not made her use of Mildronate known to most of her team, including her coach, her trainer, her physiotherapist and her nutritionist, nor any of the doctors made available to players by the WTA. Questioning why she continued taking Mildronate before matches, the report said: “In the tribunal’s view the answer is clear. Whatever the position may have been in 2006, there was in 2016 no diagnosis and no therapeutic advice supporting the continuing use of Mildronate. “If she had not concealed her use of Mildronate from the anti-doping authorities, members of her own support team and the doctors whom she consulted, but had sought advice, then the contravention would have been avoided,” it said. The ban will have an enormous impact on Sharapova’s earning potential. Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer cut its ties with Sharapova after the news of her doping violation while other sponsors such as Porsche distanced themselves from her. Nike however, said on Wednesday they would continue to work with Sharapova. “The ITF Tribunal has found that Maria did not intentionally break its rules,” the sports apparel giant said in a statement. “Maria has always made her position clear, has apologized for her mistake and is now appealing the length of the ban.”   Sharapova has 35 WTA singles titles and has won all four of the sport’s grand slam titles. Her career earnings amount to $36 million while her off-court earnings, according to Forbes, are around $200 million.

474,NKE,UPDATE 1-Adidas says soccer investment bringing rewards,"PARIS (Reuters) - Adidas (ADSGn.DE) expects sales of soccer boots, shirts and balls to rise 14 percent to a new record of 2.5 billion euros ($2.8 billion) in 2016, showing a return for spending more on partnerships with top teams and players. The German sportswear company has long been the world’s top soccer brand, but it was overtaken by U.S. rival Nike (NKE.N) in the market for boots in 2014, prompting Adidas to lift its marketing spending. Chief Executive Herbert Hainer told journalists in Paris that Adidas had edged back ahead of Nike to take 36 percent of the market for soccer boots in the top five markets in Europe in the first quarter of 2016. “Our complete restart of the football footwear business 12 months ago is paying off,” Hainer said. “We have gained market share in key markets and our footwear offering is resonating well among our young target audience.” Nike has declined to comment on its latest soccer sales before its next earnings update which is scheduled for June 28. Adidas is kitting out nine of the 24 teams playing at Euro 2016, including reigning champions Spain and Germany. Nike has six teams, including hosts France and England, and smaller German brand Puma (PUMG.DE) has five, including Italy. Adidas’ soccer shirt sales have been boosted after it poached both Manchester United (MANU.N) and Italian champions Juventus from Nike, although Nike recently hit back by taking Chelsea from Adidas from 2017. Adidas said it expects to sell 1.3 million Germany jerseys this year. That is down from the 3 million shirts it shifted in 2014, when Germany won the World Cup. Citing weak demand, some retailers have already started offering Germany shirts for below the recommended price of 85 euros, but Adidas football head Markus Baumann said they might regret that as sales were strong now Euro 2016 was under way. Footwear and balls together account for about half Adidas’ expected sales of soccer gear of 2.5 billion euros, while replica team shirts make up the rest. Soccer accounted for 13 percent of its sales in 2015. Adidas shares have soared to all-time highs in recent months due to its strong sales, while the Nike stock has dropped on concerns the firm is losing U.S. market share to Adidas and Under Armour (UA.N), with analysts also citing a profit squeeze from the rising cost of sponsorships. While Adidas’ sponsorship of UEFA and more top teams means the brand is highly visible on the pitch at Euro 2016, more players seem to be sporting lurid-coloured Nike boots.  Hainer said Adidas’s sponsorship strategy was based on quantity, rather than quality. Adidas is currently under pressure to pay more to renew its sponsorship deal with Germany.  Hainer said the two sides are in constructive talks and said he was still hopeful for a deal before he steps down as chief executive in October after 15 years as chief executive. Hainer said he believes his successor, former Henkel (HNKG_p.DE) chief Kasper Rorsted, will not ditch a five-year strategy Adidas launched last year, saying the strong sales the company has posted of late showed it was working well. However, Hainer said he hoped Rorsted, who made major strides in improving profitability at German consumer goods firm Henkel, would do the same for Adidas. “If we can keep the growth and he can help profitability, it would be a sensible mix,” he said.

475,NKE,REFILE-Adidas says beating Nike in Europe soccer boots battle,"(Clarifies paragraph 8 to show Adidas kitting out nine Euro 2016 teams) PARIS, June 16 (Reuters) - Adidas expects sales of soccer boots, shirts and balls to rise 14 percent to a new record of 2.5 billion euros  ($2.8 billion) in 2016, helped by reclaiming leadership of top European markets for soccer footwear from arch rival Nike. Germany’s Adidas has long been the world’s top soccer brand, but it was overtaken in the market for boots in 2014, prompting Adidas to launch popular new ranges and to focus its marketing spending on more top teams and players. Chief Executive Herbert Hainer told journalists in Paris that Adidas had edged ahead of Nike to take 36 percent of the market for soccer boots in the top five markets in Europe. Nike has declined to comment on its latest soccer sales before its next earnings update which is scheduled for June 28. Adidas said it expects to sell 1.3 million Germany jerseys this year, helped by the European championships now being played  in France. That is more than the 1 million it sold in 2012 when the last Euro tournament took place, but down from the 3 million shirts it shifted in 2014, when Germany won the World Cup. Citing weak demand, some retailers have already started offering Germany shirts for below the recommended price of 85 euros, but Adidas football head Markus Baumann said they might regret that as sales were strong now Euro 2016 was under way.

477,NKE,"Nike sales, forecast disappoint as Adidas gains ground","(Reuters) - Nike Inc’s (NKE.N) quarterly revenue growth and its forecast for future orders missed analysts’ estimates, underscoring the sportswear maker’s struggle to fend off competition from Adidas and others, especially in its home turf of North America. Nike’s shares, already the third worst performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average with a 15 percent drop this year through Tuesday, fell another 4.2 percent to $50.85 in extended trading. While Nike still dominates in North America, its biggest market, analysts have said it is losing ground to Germany’s Adidas (ADSGn.DE), and smaller domestic rivals such as Under Armour Inc (UA.N) are also making inroads. “You are seeing more people moving towards Adidas,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. He said Adidas was “making a comeback” and some U.S. retailers were giving more shelf space to Nike’s competition. Nike’s revenue in the fourth quarter ended May 31 was hurt by a strong dollar that ate into overseas sales. Clearing excess inventory in North America also hurt sales and margins, and is expected to dent the current quarter as well, Nike said. While Nike noted the volatility in the currency markets after Britain’s shock vote to leave the European Union, it maintained its full-year sales growth forecast. Nike expects revenue to grow in the high single digits for the year ending May 2017. Adidas, by contrast, expects its full-year currency-adjusted sales to grow 10-12 percent, thanks in part to a busy sporting calendar that includes the Rio Olympics and the European soccer championship. Nike’s orders for delivery from June through November in North America, a demand gauge it calls “futures orders”, missed expectations, signaling slowing growth. Its futures orders in the region were up 6 percent at the end of the fourth quarter, while analysts were expecting growth of 9 percent, according to Consensus Metrix. Slipping demand for its basketball shoes hurt Nike’s “futures orders”, Yarbrough said. The success of Under Armour’s basketball shoes endorsed by NBA star Stephen Curry have eaten into demand for Nike’s, endorsed by Michael Jordan and LeBron James among others.  Celebrity and team-endorsed products are big sales drivers for sportswear companies. Adidas has hiked marketing spending, particularly in North America, while Under Armour has benefited from deals with Steph Curry and golfer Jordan Spieth. Nike could benefit from higher demand for basketball shoes after LeBron James powered the Cleveland Cavaliers to their first NBA championship earlier this month. Nike’s fourth-quarter revenue rose nearly 6 percent to $8.24 billion, while analysts on average had expected revenue of $8.28 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales in North America were flat, weighed down by a fall in apparel and equipment sales. Footwear sales inched up 2 percent. Net income fell 2.2 percent to $846 million. On a per share basis, profit was flat at 49 cents and a penny higher than analysts’ estimates. Nike’s gross margins dropped 30 basis points to 45.9 percent as higher average selling prices were more than offset by higher product costs, the inventory clearance and currency rates.

480,NKE,Adidas strikes new deal with Kanye West in U.S. market push,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Adidas (ADSGn.DE) has agreed to expand its partnership with Kanye West, including opening new stores, hoping to build on its higher profile in the U.S. market since it poached the singer-turned-designer from Nike (NKE.N) in 2013. The deal was described by the German sportswear firm on Wednesday as the most significant partnership between a non-athlete and a sports brand and said it will develop beyond its current lifestyle focus to introduce sports performance designs. Adidas will create a new brand with West for footwear, clothing and accessories, and also plans new stores selling West’s Yeezy branded products along with Adidas products. West has said that he moved from Nike to Adidas because the German company gave him more creative freedom and royalties, which he said the U.S. firm told him it reserved for professional athletes such as basketball star Michael Jordan.  An Adidas spokeswoman declined to give financial details or specify the length of the deal. Media reports put the value of the previous deal at $10 million. Adidas has regained some ground in the U.S. market in recent months since falling into third place behind Nike and Under Armour (UA.N). Adidas has increased its spending on marketing and lifted its profile thanks to collaborations with celebrities such as West and singer Pharrell Williams. It has also poached the NFL’s Aaron Rodgers and basketball player James Harden from Nike. Although Nike and its Jordan brand still dominate the U.S. footwear market, Adidas sales rose almost two-thirds in May to take a 6 percent share, according to data from market research firm NPD. Nike’s overall share of the U.S. sportswear market rose to 21.1 percent in 2015 from 20.1 percent in 2014, while Under Armour was up at 3.9 percent from 3.5 percent and Adidas rose to 3.4 percent from 3.3 percent, according to Euromonitor data. On Tuesday Nike gave a lower than expected forecast for future orders, highlighting its struggle to fend off competition from Adidas and others, especially on its home turf. Adidas said a dedicated team based in the firm’s U.S. headquarters in Portland, Oregon would work with West on the development of all Yeezy products.  West’s designs so far for Adidas have concentrated on limited edition footwear, with fans camping outside stores to wait for the release of the latest Yeezy Boost shoes. “This partnership illustrates that anyone with a dream can dream without limitations,” West said on Wednesday. Adidas has announced two other major partnerships in recent weeks — one with the Wanda business empire to sponsor endurance events and promote other sports in China, and the other an extension of its shirt deal with the German soccer team.

481,NKE,"RPT-INSIGHT-Under Armour leads Olympic marketing shake-up after ""rule 40"" changes","(Repeats to widen distribution) By Liana B. Baker June 29 (Reuters) - Against a backdrop of the iconic five rings, legendary swimmer Michael Phelps sat on a United States Olympic Committee stage at a March media event in Los Angeles, telling reporters why he had arrived fashionably late. He had been rushed by private jet from Baltimore, courtesy of his sponsor Under Armour, which had held its own media event the same day (a coincidence, the company said). Phelps called Under Armour-backed athletes a “family” and its chief executive Kevin Plank a visionary with “mind-blowing ideas.” The scene previewed the kind of marketing to expect during this summer’s games, with companies operating under newly liberalized sponsorship rules - enacted after years of lobbying by athletes and their agents. Under Armour won’t pay the USOC or the International Olympic Committee for such mind-blowing branding opportunities. The company is not an official sponsor of the games. That privilege costs brands such as Nike Inc, Visa Inc and McDonald’s Corp tens of millions of dollars for explicit rights to use the rings, the word “Olympics” and other intellectual property. Sports agents and marketing executives told Reuters that Under Armour’s campaign will be the best case study for the changes to so-called rule 40, which ends a marketing blackout during the games for companies who sponsor athletes rather than the event itself. Phelps, one of Under Armour’s biggest bets, competes this week in the U.S. swimming trials, where he aims to secure a spot in his fifth Olympics. He hopes to add to his total of 18 gold medals and 22 medals total, which already makes him the most decorated Olympian of all time. On Tuesday, Phelps posted the top time in the 200 meter butterfly heats, advancing to the semi-finals. Beyond Phelps, Under Armour has backed a fleet of about 250 athletes - from the famous to the obscure - and plans a wide range of creative tactics to connect its brand to the Olympics. The apparel company will, for instance, rent a series of outdoor gyms on a 50-mile stretch of beach in Rio to set up marketing outposts and host daily workouts for fans during the games. It will entertain VIP guests in a penthouse where they can mingle with its stable of athletes. Official sponsors - worried the rule change could undermine their massive investments - will keep a keen eye out for potential infractions by other companies. John Lewicki, who oversees global Olympic sponsorship deals for McDonald’s Corp , said his company will use these games to evaluate whether to continue future Olympic deals. “I wouldn’t necessarily say we’re all happy about it,” Lewicki said. “If we find rule 40 impacts the value of our sponsorship, we could always go back and renegotiate for the future.” McDonald’s current deal, at a cost it declined to disclose, runs until after the 2020 summer games in Tokyo. Lisa Baird, USOC’s chief marketing officer said in a statement that “the USOC relies on partner support and works very hard to protect their Olympic rights, but while doing so we also look to expand opportunities for Team USA athletes.” The IOC said in a statement that it takes ambush marketing seriously and will protect its sponsors’ exclusive rights. “If there is a concerted effort to create an unauthorised commercial association with the Olympic Games or the Olympic properties, then we will take swift action,” the statement said. Before the rule change, approved last summer at the IOC session in Malaysia, athletes had long argued they were deprived of commercial attention and income during their most marketable moments. Peter Carlisle, who represents Phelps as an agent at Octagon, a unit of Interpublic Group, said the rule changes help famous athletes like his client. But more changes are needed from the IOC, he said, to help the masses of athletes. Official sponsorship proceeds, in fact, are vital to less famous participants, whom the Olympic committees support with the money. The USOC’s annual budget was $247 million in 2012, the last summer Olympics year, and the cost of sending an individual athlete to the Games averages $40,000, the USOC said. Companies sponsoring individual athletes or teams had to submit their plans months in advance to the USOC or other national committees to ensure the campaigns do not infringe on Olympics copyrights. Sports agents estimate that hundreds of brands applied for U.S. waivers. The USOC declined to release the numbers of waivers requested or granted. To feasibly take advantage of rule 40, athletes would have had to find sponsors at least six months before the games to meet the deadlines for brands to submit waiver requests. Many Olympians are only finding out in the next few weeks whether they qualify for the games in trials happening all over the world. “This is a change for the better, but it’s nowhere near where we need to get,” Carlisle said. BRANDING FREE-FOR-ALL Under Armour - along with dozens of other companies, including camera maker GoPro and beverage brands Red Bull and Gatorade, a unit of PepsiCo Inc - have already started flashy campaigns featuring Olympians. Each has sought approval to continue them during the games. In March, Under Armour released a commercial showing Phelps swimming to a song called “The Last Goodbye,” and then facing a flash of cameras. “As long as you don’t use Olympic intellectual property, like the rings or the word Olympic, you can make something that looks very beautiful,” said Lowell Taub, head of sports endorsements at CAA Sports, an agency that works with Olympians such as gymnast Gabby Douglas. Under Armour’s “family” includes other big name athletes who are expected to compete in Rio: Jordan Spieth in golf, Andy Murray in tennis and Kelley O’Hara in soccer. It suffered a blow, however, when Steph Curry - one of its highest profile athletes and a star point guard for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association - opted out of playing for the U.S. basketball team in Rio so he could rest his injured knee. The USOC said it plans to police any marketing activity that could hurt their official sponsors’ investments, including on social media, but it declined to detail its enforcement plans. Nike, Under Armour’s biggest competition in Rio, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The flood of new marketing during a three-week Olympics period is likely to pose steep enforcement challenges. Phelps’ agent, Carlisle, predicted there would be so many violations of rule 40 this summer - especially on social media - that “it’ll make your head spin.” Brands are taking their own measures to protect their sponsorship rights. McDonald’s said it plans to work with media monitoring agencies, and its own internal marketing teams will watch social media closely to evaluate the impact of the changes. A source who has negotiated previous IOC sponsorship deals said that top global sponsors spend about $25 million per year for the rights, or about $100 million for four-year period that includes a summer and winter games. The IOC hopes to double fees to $200 million per four year period starting in 2021, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. That could mean tough negotiations for the IOC with current sponsors. Under Armour will likely spend considerably less. It has chosen instead to cut much less expensive deals to outfit the athletes in several national governing bodies, which are groups that oversee specific sports in various countries such as USA Gymnastics, USA Boxing, Rugby Canada and beach volleyball in Switzerland and the Netherlands. The company does not disclose how much it invests in Olympics marketing, but it reported in a filing that its marketing costs rose by 14 percent - to $122.5 million from $107.6 million - during the first quarter ended March 31, compared to a year ago. The company attributed the increase to “key marketing campaigns and investments in sponsorships” in the filing, which covered the period when it unveiled Olympic-themed commercials. Under Armour plenty of reasons to keep pushing hard at the Olympics, said Morningstar analyst Paul Swinand. Unlike Nike, only a small percentage its sales come from international markets, and it needs to catch up to rivals in India and China, he said. Peter Murray, vice president of sports marketing for Under Armour, didn’t rule out becoming an official sponsor at some point. “As we look to grow the brand and the business around the world outside the US, Olympics will continue to play a role in that,” Murray said. “We are really just getting started.”   (Reporting by Liana B.

482,NKE,Under Armour leads Olympic marketing shake-up after 'rule 40' changes,"(Reuters) - Against a backdrop of the iconic five rings, legendary swimmer Michael Phelps sat on a United States Olympic Committee stage at a March media event in Los Angeles, telling reporters why he had arrived fashionably late. He had been rushed by private jet from Baltimore, courtesy of his sponsor Under Armour (UA.N), which had held its own media event the same day (a coincidence, the company said). Phelps called Under Armour-backed athletes a “family” and its chief executive Kevin Plank a visionary with “mind-blowing ideas.”     The scene previewed the kind of marketing to expect during this summer’s games, with companies operating under newly liberalized sponsorship rules - enacted after years of lobbying by athletes and their agents.

That privilege costs brands such as Nike Inc NIKE.N, Visa Inc (V.N) and McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) tens of millions of dollars for explicit rights to use the rings, the word “Olympics” and other intellectual property.

492,NKE,UPDATE 3-Puma expects even closer ties if Usain Bolt retires,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German sportswear firm Puma (PUMG.DE) wants to forge even closer ties with Usain Bolt, the highest profile athlete it sponsors, if the Jamaican sprinter retires after the Rio Olympics, predicting he could be just as valuable off the track. “Usain is part of the Puma family,” Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden told reporters on Wednesday. “If he decides not to run, we will probably work even closer with him,” he said, adding Bolt would have more time for product development and could even take on a commercial role at Puma. Bigger rival Nike (NKE.N) has built a brand with annual sales of $2.8 billion with retired basketballer Michael Jordan, while Adidas (ADSGn.DE) still uses former England soccer star David Beckham to promote its products. Gulden made the comments after Puma reported a stronger-than-expected rise in second quarter sales, helped by the European soccer championships as well as products designed by singer Rihanna, appointed women’s creative director in 2014. Bolt has been at the center of a push by Gulden to put more emphasis on sport performance gear rather than fashion, also bolstered by its sponsorship of English soccer side Arsenal. Bolt has promoted Puma’s “Ignite” running shoes, but Bankhaus Lampe analyst Peter Steiner said track and field was a relatively small category so his eventual retirement was unlikely to be a big hit. Puma reported a quarterly net profit of 1.6 million euros  ($1.8 million), compared with a loss of 3.3 million a year ago. Sales rose 7 percent to 827 million euros. Puma shares pared earlier gains to trade up 0.2 percent by 1051 GMT, while owner Kering (PRTP.PA) rose 2.3 percent. Adidas, which has been hitting a series of record highs in anticipation of bumper results on Aug. 4, was up 1.1 percent. Gulden said it was not clear whether the six-time Olympic sprint champion, who has been sponsored by Puma since he was 15 years old, would keep running after the Rio Olympics, saying Bolt might need time off to think about it. Gulden said the Jamaican was already helping Puma hunt for a successor, adding the company has a strong scouting operating in the Caribbean: “We have to admit there won’t be a second Usain but there will be something else,” he said. While the Olympics is a major platform for the brand, Gulden said it was hard to measure a direct impact on sales as fans do not buy replica team shirts in the same way they do for soccer. Puma’s quarterly sales jumped a currency-adjusted 23.5 percent in Europe, Middle East and Africa, helped by its sponsorship of five national soccer teams at Euro 2016. Gulden said Puma’s partnerships with Rihanna and celebrity Kylie Jenner were helping it win more space at key retailers, which are all putting more focus on the women’s business because it is growing faster than the men’s.

494,NKE,Nike to exit golf equipment business,"(Reuters) - Nike Inc (NKE.N), the world’s biggest sportswear maker, said it would stop selling golf equipment, including clubs, golf balls and bags.  The company, which built its golf business on the success of golfer Tiger Woods, said it would instead accelerate innovation in its golf footwear and apparel business and on partnering with more golfers. Nike did not give a timeline for the planned exit.  The company is the second major sporting goods maker reviewing its golf business.

498,NKE,Adidas to open shoe factory in Atlanta in 2017,"LONDON (Reuters) - Adidas will open a new factory near Atlanta in 2017  largely operated by robots, part of a drive to shift production closer to customers and counter rising wages in Asia and lengthy shipping times. The sportswear company has already started work at a similar factory in the southern German town of Ansbach. The two factories are each expected to produce half a million shoes for running and other categories in the medium term. Founded by German cobbler Adi Dassler in 1949, Adidas had closed all but one of its 10 shoe factories in Germany by 1993 as it shifted most production from Europe to lower-cost Asia, particularly China and Vietnam. But advances in robotics and automation means that Adidas can now bring production back closer to customers to meet demands for faster delivery of new styles. “This allows us to make product for the consumer, with the consumer, where the consumer lives, in real time,” brand director Eric Liedtke said, adding the factory would allow Adidas to customize more products for individuals. Rival Nike, which has faced criticism for using Asian sweat shops to produce its footwear, promised last year to create 10,000 jobs in the United States in the next decade by producing more in its home market. Nike has also worked to improve conditions overseas. Adidas has said the new plants would supplement rather than replace production in Asia, noting that Adidas currently makes about 300 million pairs of shoes a year and already needs to add two factories a year to keep up with current rates of growth. The new U.S. factory will create around 160 jobs and is being operated by Oechsler Motion GmbH. Adidas is also working with German engineering group Manz to develop new automated production technology.

502,NKE,Nike's stock falls behind rivals at Rio Olympics,"SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Nike has top billing among sports brands at the Rio Olympics, but a week into the games, its stock is losing to Adidas and Under Armour. The quadrennial global sports event exposes apparel brands worn by top athletes to hundreds of millions of viewers, but growing competition and higher costs may be reducing the benefits of major endorsement deals. Since the summer Olympics started last week, shares of official games sponsor Nike have risen 1.0 percent as of Friday. But rival stocks have dashed ahead, with Under Armour up 2.3 percent and Adidas 5.9 percent firmer on a strong quarterly report. Neither Adidas nor Under Armour are official Olympics sponsors. But Under Armour sponsors about 250 athletes, including U.S. swimming legend Michael Phelps. Adidas supplies uniforms to teams including Britain and Germany, and it is releasing special-edition sneakers lined in bronze, silver and gold. Shares of Nike, which also sponsors the U.S. team, had delivered strong summer Olympic performances until the last two games. The stock surged by a range of 4 to 19 percent during the six summer games from 1984 to 2004. But it fell almost 3 percent during the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and the same amount during the 2012 games in London, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Under Armour listed its shares in 2005. “You have increased competition. Under Armour is a public company out there now competing for more sponsorships. It’s more expensive for the companies involved,” said Bespoke cofounder Paul Hickey. Following Thursday’s gold-medal performances from Phelps and U.S. gymnast Simone Biles, the next couple of days may be climactic for investors rooting for the shares of Nike and Dick’s Sporting Goods, the official retailer of U.S. team T-shirts and other apparel. “This might be the weekend when people go out to stores, because last night was the most excitement I’ve had so far,” said TD Ameritrade Chief Market Strategist JJ Kinahan, who is tracking the stock performance of 24 Olympics sponsors. Ralph Lauren shares surged 12 percent this week after the U.S. team appeared at Friday’s opening ceremony sporting uniforms it designed, emblazoned with the company’s logo. Shares of Adidas hit a record high on Thursday after the German company earlier this month posted its highest second-quarter sales growth in a decade. Expansion is being fueled by its Originals fashion business as well as soccer and running gear. Nike, feeling the heat from Adidas, Under Armour and rivals in China, disappointed Wall Street with its most recent quarterly scorecard in late June. While its shares have gained 6 percent since, they remain down 10 percent in 2016, making Nike the worst performer in the Dow Jones industrial average.

508,NKE,UPDATE 3-Nike orders miss estimates as competition heats up,"(Reuters) - Nike Inc’s (NKE.N) future orders missed analysts’ estimates for the third time in a row, as the world’s largest footwear maker struggles with increasing competition from Under Armour Inc (UA.N) and a resurgent Adidas (ADSGn.DE) in North America. Shares of the company, which reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit, fell 4.4 percent to $52.90 in after-market trading on Tuesday.  The stock is the worst performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year, down about 11 percent to Tuesday’s close. Nike and its Jordan brand still command the lion’s share of the U.S. footwear market, but rivals Adidas and Under Armour are chipping away at the company’s decades-long dominant position. The company has lost basketball sales to Under Armour since the latter poached Golden State Warriors player Stephen Curry in 2013. It is also suffering from a revival at Adidas, which has scored mostly with fashion shoes promoted by celebrities such as Kanye West, who moved from Nike to Adidas the same year. “Adidas is red-hot right now and retailers can’t get enough of it,” Edward Jones Analyst Brian Yarbrough told Reuters adding that some U.S. retailers were giving more shelf space to Nike’s competition.     Sales of Adidas’ classic shoes nearly quadrupled in August, compared with a 33 percent rise in Nike’s similar line, according to market research firm NPD.  Under Armour has also been pushing deeper into department stores. The second-biggest U.S. sportswear maker said it would sell its products at U.S. department store operator Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N) from 2017. Nike said on a conference call that it would now issue a forecast for its future orders, a key indicator of demand, during the earnings call, moving away from a years-long tradition of announcing it in the earnings release.  The move to stop issuing future orders seems “very suspect” at a time when North America and other markets have slowed down, Yarbrough said.  The company said global orders from September 2016 through January 2017 were up 7 percent on a constant-currency basis, missing the 8 percent increase analysts’ had expected.  The forecast - keenly watched by investors - was the lowest in five quarters.  Net income rose 5.9 percent to $1.25 billion, or 73 cents per share, in the first quarter ended Aug. 31. Revenue rose 7.7 percent to $9.06 billion, while inventories jumped 11 percent to $4.9 billion.

Nike’s futures ordering program allows retailers to order five or six months in advance of delivery, with the commitment delivery will be made within a set time at a fixed price. Nike said on Tuesday its global orders for September through January were up 7 percent on a constant-currency basis, missing the 8 percent increase analysts had expected. “Despite the threat from a push by competition and disappointing futures, we view Nike’s scale and dominance as a long-term barrier to entry and maintain our ‘buy’ despite what appears a nascent share loss,” Nomura Securities analyst Simeon Siegel wrote in a client note. Analysts also noted that Nike’s futures orders for all regions except North America had met or beaten estimates.     Nike shares were set to open about 1.2 percent lower at $54.68 on Wednesday, even though the company’s quarterly revenue and profit beat Wall Street estimates. The shares fell as much as 5 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the release of the results. At least eight brokerages cut their price targets on the company’s stock, with FBR Securities reducing the most, by $8 to $55. The median price target is $63.

514,NKE,Chelsea agree long-term kit deal with Nike,"LONDON (Reuters) - Chelsea announced on Thursday a long-term partnership with Nike from next year in a deal that media reports suggested could be worth 60 million pounds ($74.61 million) a season. Without giving financial details, Chelsea said it represented the largest commercial deal in the Premier League club’s history. “Nike will produce strips for the first team, academy and ladies teams, as well as a full range of clothing for Chelsea’s millions of supporters around the world,” the club said in a statement. Chelsea’s current kit is produced by Adidas, which said in May it had reached a mutual agreement to end its deal on June 30, 2017, instead of in 2023 as originally agreed, allowing the club to enter a new agreement with another competitor. Media reports have indicated Adidas were paying Chelsea an estimated 30 million pounds ($43.38 million) a year, with the Nike deal likely to be double that figure. Adidas agreed in 2014 to pay 750 million pounds ($1.1 billion) to replace Nike as sponsor of Manchester United for a decade. “This is an incredibly exciting and important deal for the club,” Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia told the club website (www.chelseafc.com). “We believe Nike will be able to support our growth into new markets as well as helping us maintain our place among the world’s elite soccer clubs.”   Chelsea, owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, won the Premier League title in 2014-15 but a poor run of form last season meant they failed to qualify for European football. They are currently seventh in the standings after seven games.  ",10132016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nike-sponsorship-chelsea/chelsea-agree-long-term-kit-deal-with-nike-idUSKCN12D22T

519,NKE,UPDATE 2-Ex-chairman eyes bid for bankruptcy-hit Performance Sports,"(Reuters) - Performance Sports Group Ltd PSG.TO PSG.N, the maker of Bauer ice hockey gear, said on Monday it had filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States and Canada to facilitate a restructuring and sale of almost all of its assets. The company, which also makes baseball bats and other sports equipment, said it would put its assets up for auction but already had a deal to sell nearly all of them for $575 million to an investor group led by Sagard Capital, its biggest shareholder, and Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd (FFH.TO).  Reuters reported on Friday that Performance would file for bankruptcy with a buyer in hand and would seek out higher bids. Former Performance Chairman Graeme Roustan told Reuters in August that he was working with investment banks to explore a bid for the company. Performance’s troubles highlight the challenges North American manufacturers face in the highly competitive sporting goods market.  The company listed assets of $500 million to $1 billion and liabilities of $500 million to $1 billion in its voluntary petition filed in Delaware under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  The company said it had begun proceedings under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act in Canada’s Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Performance said it expected operations to continue uninterrupted during the bankruptcy process, through a $386 million debtor-in-possession financing provided by existing lenders and the investor group. The company also announced management changes. President Amir Rosenthal and Executive Vice President Todd Harman left on Friday. Dan Sills was named executive vice president, hockey, and Mike Thorne was appointed executive vice president, baseball/softball. Jennifer Hughey was named senior vice president, supply chain.

520,NKE,UPDATE 2-Puma sees year profits hitting top end of targeted range,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German sportswear firm Puma (PUMG.DE) reported strong third-quarter profits on Thursday, due to tight cost controls, improved sourcing and higher prices, and said its full-year operating profit should come in at the top end of its expectations. Installed by majority owner Kering (PRTP.PA) in 2013, Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden has led a gradual turnaround of a brand that had fallen out of favor, pushing it further behind market leaders Nike (NKE.N) and Adidas (ADSGn.DE). Gulden has managed to revive sales growth, but improving profitability has been made more difficult by the strong U.S. dollar, the currency in which the sportswear industry sources most products in Asia. In response, Gulden has sought to impose a strict control on costs, while increasing some prices and shifting more production to markets like Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Those efforts bore some fruit in the third quarter, with net profit almost doubling to 39.5 million euros, beating average analyst forecasts for 33 million euros. It now expects its full-year earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) to be in upper half of the range of 115 million to 125 million euros, reiterating a forecast for a high single-digit rise in currency-adjusted sales. Puma’s shares were up 1.4 percent by 0429 ET, bringing their gains this year to almost 11 percent, outperforming a 1 percent rise for the German small-cap index .SDAXI. Gulden said new products like Ignite Dual running shoes promoted by Olympic sprinter Usain Bolt and the Fenty fashion line designed by singer Rihanna were proving popular. “More consumers are buying our products at full price and retailers are therefore more satisfied with us,” he said, adding that products for women were selling particularly well. Puma appointed Rihanna as women’s creative director in 2014 as it seeks to tap into the “athleisure” trend of sports clothing being worn as a fashion statement, also partnering with top models like Cara Delevingne and Kylie Jenner. Gulden shrugged off suggestions that slowing sales for both Nike and Under Armour Inc (UA.N) in North America might be a signal that “athleisure” might have peaked. “We are coming from a low base. We are very, very happy with the development in the U.S. in the last eight to 10 weeks because our products are selling through. Our sales are not slowing down, more the opposite,” he told reporters. Rival Adidas last week gave a cautious outlook for 2017 after it reported its quarterly net profit rose 15 percent on sales up 14 percent and reiterated a forecast for 2016 currency-adjusted sales to grow at a percentage rate in the high teens.

522,NKE,Nike revenue beats; sees rebound in basketball category,"(Reuters) - Nike Inc (NKE.N), the world’s largest footwear maker, reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit, and indicated a rebound in its basketball category. The company’s shares were up 1.7 percent at $52.67 in after-market trading on Tuesday.  Nike’s basketball business has come under pressure, particularly from rival Under Armour’s (UAA.N) NBA-star Stephen Curry’s signature shoe line. In response, Nike has redesigned its basketball products and delivered better priced products, such as the Jordan 31 and Kobe A.D. “We’re seeing incredible momentum in basketball, to be clear, basketball is back,” Trevor Edwards, president of the Nike Brand, said on a conference call. The company expects its basketball category to return to growth in the back half of its year ending May 2017, Edwards said. Basketball category accounted for 5.1 percent of Nike’s total wholesale revenue of $27.23 billion in its financial year ended May 2016. The Jordan brand, which also sells items primarily focused on basketball, brought in another 10 percent. Nike executives also repeatedly emphasized during the call that its revenue forecast was a “much more comprehensive” reflection of its outlook than futures orders, an indicator that Wall Street analysts and investors focused on. The company stopped issuing futures orders forecast in its earnings release beginning the latest quarter. Nike forecast full-year revenue to grow in the high single digits, and said currency-neutral futures orders were growing 2 percent. The company said it expected North America, its biggest market, to continue to grow in second half with return to expanding gross margins and tighter inventory levels. Sales in North America rose 3 percent to $3.65 billion in the second quarter ended Nov. 30. Nike’s sales in Greater China rose 12 percent to $1.06 billion in the latest quarter. Excluding the impact of currency changes, sales in the region jumped 17 percent. However, gross margins contracted 140 basis points to 44.2 percent, due to increased product costs, a strong dollar and   higher off-price sales. The company’s net income rose 7.3 percent to $842 million, or 50 cents per share, in the three months ended Nov. 30.     Analysts on average had expected earnings of 43 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Analysts’ average profit estimate had dropped from 52 cents per share in September, according to Thomson Reuters data.   Selling and administrative expenses fell 2 percent to $2.51 billion.     Revenue rose 6.4 percent to $8.18 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $8.09 billion. The stock is the worst performing Dow Jones component this year with a 17 percent drop.

Proud to join the family!” Woods wrote on his twitter account. The American, who won his 14 major titles endorsing Nike, was forced to switch when the sportswear and equipment giant decided to get out of the hard goods part of the golf business. While Woods will be swinging new clubs, he will continue to wear Nike’s familiar swoosh on his golfing apparel Sidelined by back pain for the past 15 months, Woods launches his official comeback on Thursday at the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines in southern California, an event he has won seven times. Woods also captured the 2008 U.S. Open there on one of his favourite layouts. He joins a TaylorMade team that includes Australian world number one Jason Day and American U.S. Open champion Dustin Johnson. The 41-year-old American has not played an official money event since Aug. 2015 and pulled out of a planned return at the first tournament of the 2016-17 season in northern California in October. He said then that his game was not ready but subsequently made his comeback at the Hero World Challenge, an unofficial PGA Tour event, in the Bahamas in December where he finished 15th in an 18-man field.

529,NKE,Nike to launch high-tech hijab for female Muslim athletes,"(Reuters) - Nike Inc (NKE.N) will launch a hijab for female Muslim athletes early next year, becoming the first major sports apparel maker to offer a traditional Islamic head scarf designed specifically for competition, the company said on Wednesday. The head covering, marketed under the “Pro Hijab” brand, is designed to allow athletes to observe the traditional Islamic practice of covering the head without compromising performance. Made from a lightweight, flexible material, the hijab is expected to hit stores shelves in early 2018, Nike said in a statement. In recent years, the hijab has become the most visible symbol of Islamic culture in the United States and Europe. Many Muslim women cover their heads in public with the hijab as a sign of modesty, but some critics see it as a sign of female oppression. With sensitivities over immigration and the perceived threat of Muslim extremism running high, the head scarf has led to attacks against Muslim women. At the same time, the hijab has evolved in a symbol of diversity that Nike has embraced. The Women’s March on Washington, held the day after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, used the face of a woman wearing a hijab in an American flag pattern as its promotional image. Muslim athletes visiting Nike’s headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, just outside of Portland, have complained about the difficulties of wearing a hijab while competing, according to the company. The company consulted with Muslim women athletes from around the world, including Middle Eastern runners and cyclists, in the designing the hijab. Other companies have also set their sights on hijab sales to Muslim athletes. Last year, Danish sportswear company Hummel unveiled a soccer jersey with an attached hijab for the Afghanistan national women’s soccer team. Non-professional women Muslim athletes have used athletic hijabs made by smaller companies. But Nike’s annual net sales in the billions, and its reach in popular culture, can do more to bring Muslim athletes into the fold, said Amna Al Haddad, a Nike sponsored weightlifter from the United Arab Emirates who consulted on “Pro Hijab.” “(It will) encourage a whole new generation to pursue sports without feeling there is a limitation because of modesty or dress-code,” Haddad said.

531,NKE,"Adidas U.S. push keeps up pressure on Nike, Under Armour","HERZOGENAURACH, Germany (Reuters) - The new boss of Adidas (ADSGn.DE) increased sales and profit targets on Wednesday, sending shares in the German sportswear firm to a record high as he pledged to keep investing heavily in the key U.S. market and do more to boost e-commerce sales. The more ambitious targets will maintain a squeeze on U.S. rivals Nike (NKE.N) and Under Armour (UAA.N), which have both been losing sales to the German brand in their home market, where Adidas’s retro Superstar was the top-selling shoe of 2016. “We are still in catch-up mode in North America,” Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted told journalists, noting that the United States accounts for a third of global sportwear sales but is the only market where Adidas significantly lags Nike. Rorsted, the Danish former head of consumer goods firm Henkel (HNKG_p.DE), replaced long-serving boss Herbert Hainer in October with a mandate to improve profitability after activist shareholders took stakes in Adidas in 2015 as the German firm fell further behind Nike in the United States. Even before Rorsted took over, Adidas had made significant strides, lifting marketing spending and shaking up its U.S. business, helping its shares rise two-thirds in the last 12 months even though its profitability still lags that of Nike. Adidas shares, which are now trading at a big premium to Nike, jumped 7 percent by 1103 GMT to hit a new record high, headed for their best day since November 2015.  “The mid-term guidance clearly implies that new management anticipate a multi-year growth path, taking share from most peers,” said Equinet analyst Mark Josefson, who raised his recommendation on the stock to “buy” from “neutral”. Adidas more than doubled its share of the U.S. athletic footwear market to 10 percent in January, but remained far behind Nike on 45 percent, according to market data firm NPD. Rorsted said Adidas had been unable to keep up with demand for its springy-soled Boost shoes made popular by singer Kanye West, adding that it would take 12-18 months for partner BASF (BASFn.DE) to increase capacity so it could supply more soles. Rorsted said Adidas would keep investing heavily in the United States, including in staff, infrastructure, marketing and in-store fittings, noting that retailers such as Foot Locker and Dicks Sporting Goods were positive about the brand’s future.  German rival Puma (PUMG.DE) has also been enjoying a revival in the U.S. market, helped by a shift towards retro styles and away from basketball shoes which has hurt Under Armour and dampened Nike’s success. Rorsted said he wanted to focus even more strongly on the Adidas and Reebok brands in future, announcing plans to sell the ice hockey brand in addition to its golf business, which has been on the block since last May but has yet to find a buyer. Finance chief Robin Stalker said he hoped to seal the sale of the golf unit before too long, but it was no fire sale as the performance of the business was improving, saying he was in negotiations with several bidders. Adidas said on Tuesday it had appointed Harm Ohlmeyer, head of the group’s global e-commerce business, as new finance chief from May 12, replacing Stalker. Rorsted said he wants to expand the use of technologies such as 3D printing, and double the e-commerce sales target for 2020 to 4 billion euros ($4.2 billion) out of an expected 25 to 27 billion euro total, and from 1 billion achieved in 2016. Nike has set a target to reach $7 billion in e-commerce sales by 2020, out of expected total revenue of $50 billion. Rorsted also announced plans to simplify business processes, including further trimming the number of articles offered and harmonizing marketing activities, similar to measures he took to boost profitability at Henkel. Rorsted also said he would make a push to promote more women at the firm based in conservative southern Germany, while introducing a plan to link pay for top executives to the Adidas share price. Adidas lifted targets for currency-neutral revenues to rise between 10 and 12 percent on average between 2015 and 2020, and said the operating profit margin should rise to 11 percent from 7.6 percent in 2016, albeit still shy of Nike’s 14 percent. For 2017, Adidas forecast currency-neutral sales growth of between 11 and 13 percent and net income to rise by as much as a fifth to a level up to 1.22 billion euros, ahead of the 1.13 billion euros expected by analysts.

533,NKE,Adidas banks on sports as lifestyle to drive U.S. sales,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Adidas (ADSGn.DE) set a target on Tuesday for sales in North America to rise by almost half by 2020, predicting strong demand will continue for fashion sneakers after its retro Superstar was the top selling shoe in the U.S. market in 2016. The revival of the German brand has been hurting rivals Nike (NKE.N) and Under Armour (UAA.N) but some investors are concerned that Adidas is too reliant on fickle trends such as the recent popularity of its Superstar and Stan Smith shoes. Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted said the North American market is the “biggest challenge and the biggest opportunity” for Adidas, targeting sales of 5 billion euros ($5.3 billion) by 2020, after a 24 percent jump to 3.4 billion euros in 2016. Shares in Adidas soared last week after the company increased sales and profit forecasts, targeting total sales of 25 billion to 27 billion euros by 2020. The stock was down 1.7 percent at 1330 GMT. Rorsted told an investor day that the fashion-driven Originals business, which includes the retro brands such as Superstars, had grown 80 percent in North America in 2016.   Adidas running sales had climbed 40 percent last year in North America while sales U.S. sports such as American football and basketball rose 25 percent. Brand chief Eric Liedtke said he was comfortable with the balance, noting that a recent survey by market intelligence group NPD showed that two-thirds of sportswear is actually used for leisure rather than sport. “It doesn’t mean we want to become a leisure brand. It just means we need to understand how the consumer is consuming the product,” Liedtke said. Liedtke declined to comment on how many Superstar or Stan Smith shoes Adidas sold in 2016 after it shifted 15 million and 8 million pairs respectively in 2015.  But he said Adidas had not seen any slowdown in a backlog of orders for Originals overall, and highlighted strong demand for new models such as Tubular Shadow sneakers, and Parley shoes made from recycled plastic waste collected from the ocean. Liedtke said Adidas had become better at managing launches of new shoes to generate hype, and adjusting its supply chain so that it could respond more quickly to demand for top sellers. When the Tubular Shadow launched in November, Adidas produced 250,000 pairs, which quickly sold out so it ramped up production to 1.1 million pairs within 60 days, Liedtke said, with 3 million due in six months and 8 million in a year.

Similar to CBS network’s “60 Minutes” in the United States, the CCTV show - known as “315” in reference to global consumer rights day on March 15 - has previously named and shamed firms from Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE). The two-hour show - a mix of undercover reports and song-and-dance - also highlighted Japanese brands including Muji, owned by Ryohin Keikaku Co (7453.T), which it said sold food products in China from an area of Tokyo where high levels of radiation were detected in 2015. A Ryohin Keikaku spokesman said on Thursday the firm was “not selling any food products in China from areas banned from exporting due to concerns about radioactive contamination”. Muji’s China website said it was a misunderstanding, as the company’s registered address and the food production site were different.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Japan had not given clear answers about the effect and extent of radiation leaks from the Fukushima nuclear crisis of 2011 and called for greater transparency.  Nike said in a statement it had sold 300 pairs of Hyperdunk shoes in China last year with “an inaccurate product description stating that the shoe contained airbags”. The firm added it had apologized to consumers and offered compensation. “We will fully cooperate with the government regulators regarding their inquiries,” the company said. The Greater China region accounts for over 10 percent of Nike’s global sales. The show also took aim at fake eye doctors for scamming patients, animal breeders for over-using medicines to make animals grow faster, and China’s Wikipedia-like Baike.com. The 315 show can hit a firm’s reputation if singled out for bad corporate behavior. Apple was forced into a rare apology in 2013 after criticism on the show of its China after-sales service. “Pretty much all the big corporations have their PR machines ready to jump into action because they’ve seen what happens when companies are not prepared,” said James Feldkamp, Shanghai-based CEO of independent China consumer watchdog Mingjian. While the annual program has lost some of its bite in recent years, Wednesday’s version was harder hitting than last year’s, which criticized local food delivery apps, fake online sales and dodgy false teeth, but didn’t take aim at any major international firms. However, many in China steered clear of the show altogether, while online chatter was more muted than in previous years. Viewers who tuned in said they were underwhelmed by the show’s corporate exposés and any impact would likely be short-lived. “This year’s show was a laughing stock, there weren’t any really big cases in there,” posted one user on Sina Weibo using the name Master Tan Xi. “Why do they bother still holding it?” ",3162017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-consumerday/china-consumer-day-show-skewers-nike-shoes-muji-foods-idUSKBN16M17B

536,NKE,Adidas takes the sweat out of sweater shopping with in-store machine,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Adidas has been testing a store where shoppers can design a sweater, have a body scan to determine fit and get it knitted by a state-of-the-art machine within hours, as the German company looks at ways to respond more quickly to customer demands.  The sportswear group is working on several initiatives to cut the time it takes to get new designs to stores from the 12 to 18 months now standard in the sneaker industry, including opening factories mainly operated by robots in Germany and the United States. It hopes the drive will help it adjust better to fickle fashion trends, allowing it to sell more products at full price as it seeks to meet a new goal to bring its operating profit margin closer to rival Nike’s by 2020. At a pop-up Adidas store in a mall in Berlin, customers designed their own merino wool sweaters for 200 euros ($215) each and then had them knitted in the store, finished by hand, washed and dried, all within four hours. Shoppers first entered a darkened room where swirling camouflage and spider web patterns were projected onto their chests, with options to shift the light using hand gestures picked up by sensors, like in an interactive video game. Dozens of possible options were recorded and the customers picked their favorite ones on a computer screen, where they could also experiment with different color combinations. Customers chose standard sizes or stripped down to their underwear for laser body scans. Then the personalized pattern was sent to an industrial knitting machines in the store. “It is very individual. It is like knitting your own sweater,” said Christina Sharif, adding she ordered shorter arms on her electric blue sweater than the standard model. Adidas wants 50 percent of its products to be made in a faster time frame by 2020, double the rate in 2016, which it expects will increase the proportion of products sold at full price to 70 percent from less than half now. “If we can give the consumer what they want, where they want it, when they want it, we can decrease risk ... at the moment we are guessing what might be popular,” Adidas brand chief Eric Liedtke told investors last week. The “Knit for You” store is part of a research project supported by the German government in cooperation with academics and industrial partners. A store assistant said it had sold up to 10 sweaters on busy days, particularly before Christmas. An Adidas spokeswoman said the data and feedback from the project were now being evaluated before the company decided whether to pursue the concept.

537,NKE,Nike's revenue misses estimates as rivals gain ground,"(Reuters) - Nike Inc (NKE.N) reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue on Tuesday as the world’s largest footwear maker battles for market share in North America with a resurgent Adidas AG and a fast-growing Under Armour Inc. Shares of the Dow component were down 3.6 percent at $55.91 in post-market trading on Tuesday, after the company also forecast a key metric on orders below analysts’ expectations. Nike and its Jordan brand have been dominant in the U.S. footwear market for years, but Adidas (ADSGn.DE) and Under Armour (UAA.N) are gaining ground by revamping their brands and introducing new products. Nike has lost basketball sales to Under Armour since its rival poached the NBA’s Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry in 2013. Germany’s Adidas has also been successful in its efforts to muscle back into the U.S. market, with fashion shoes made popular by collaborations with celebrities such as Kanye West, Pharrell Williams and Rita Ora. “A lot of the concern about Nike is its growth in a competitive environment. Three to five years ago, a competitive environment (for Nike) was almost non-existent and the market was moving towards athleisure,” said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough. Nike said its worldwide orders for delivery, a demand gauge it calls “futures orders”, fell 1 percent on a currency-neutral basis. Analysts on average had expected it to rise 3.5 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. On a reported basis, futures orders fell about 4 percent. Nike’s sales in North America, the company’s biggest market, rose 3 percent in the quarter ended Feb. 28. Sales in Greater China were up 9 percent in the quarter, falling short of double-digit growth for the first time in at least nine quarters. However, excluding the impact of currency moves, sales in the Greater China region were up 15 percent. Nike was criticized at China’s annual consumer rights day television show earlier this month, where it was said to have mislead consumers over high-tech air cushions in some of its “Hyperdunk” basketball shoes. Gross margins contracted 140 basis points to 44.5 percent during the quarter, hurt by a strong dollar and more off-price sales. Nike reported a third-quarter profit of 68 cents per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of 53 cents per share. Revenue rose 5 percent to $8.43 billion in the quarter, versus the average estimate of $8.47 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding currency fluctuations, revenue rose 7 percent.

French centrist Emmanuel Macron’s performance in a television debate raised expectations that he would win the presidential election over the far-right’s Marine Le Pen, boosting sentiment across Europe, with shares edging up towards 15-month highs. Global investors have been worried about increasing protectionism, following the Brexit vote and President Donald Trump’s election. Last week, the G20 leaders dropped a pledge to keep global trade free and open. “U.S. equity markets are expected to open a little higher on Tuesday, tracking broad gains in Europe,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at online forex broker Oanda in London. Investors will keep an eye on speeches by several Federal  Reserve officials for clues on the path of future interest rate hikes after the central bank last week raised rates for the first time this year. The Fed stuck to its outlook for two more hikes this year, instead of the three expected by the market. Bank of Kansas City President Esther George and Cleveland Fed chief Loretta Mester are scheduled to speak later in the day, while Boston Fed head Eric Rosengren will release the text of his speech. The Fed is on track to raise interest rates twice more this year and it could be more or less aggressive depending on inflation and fiscal policies from the Trump administration, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Monday. “Investors continue to expect two more rate hikes this year, although the odds have slipped slightly since last week. That said, I still expect the Federal Reserve tightening cycle to be much more aggressive than other central banks over the next couple of years,” said Erlam. Dow e-minis were up 10 points, or 0.05 percent, with 17,182 contracts changing hands at 8:27 a.m. ET (1227 GMT). S&P; 500 e-minis were up 3.5 points, or 0.15 percent, with 97,235 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 10.25 points, or 0.19 percent, on volume of 20,677 contracts. Oil prices climbed on Tuesday, helped by expectations that an OPEC-led output cut would be extended beyond June but gains were pegged back by concerns about persistently high crude inventories. Wall Street drifted lower on Monday as investors worried that Trump’s plan to cut taxes and boost the economy could take longer than previously expected. The U.S. stock market has been on a record-setting spree since the election of Trump, but the rally has faltered in recent weeks as investors fret about a lack of clarity on his proposals to reform taxes and cut regulation. Shares of General Mills fell 1.8 percent to $59.20 in premarket trading after the Cheerios maker’s quarterly sales missed expectations. Apple rose 0.45 percent to $142.09 after the company unveiled a new version of its iPad tablet. Esperion Therapeutics was up 3.1 percent at $42.50 and Nektar Therapeutics gained 3.4 percent to $22.80 after J.P. Morgan raised its price targets on the stocks.

The Dow was lower in morning trading, dragged down by a 6.2 percent fall in Nike after the world’s largest footwear maker’s quarterly revenue missed estimates amid intensifying competition in North America. Trump on Tuesday tried to rally Republican lawmakers behind a plan to dismantle Obamacare, his first major legislation since assuming office in January. Republican leaders aim to move the controversial legislation to the House floor for debate as early as Thursday, amid concerns over support from party lawmakers. Some investors fear that if the healthcare reform act runs into trouble or takes longer-than-expected to pass, then Trump’s tax reform policies may face setbacks. The concerns triggered the biggest one-day fall since the November election on Wall Street on Tuesday. “The markets were reminded yesterday the ‘Trump trade’ is not a one-way trade and there’s room for disappointment as actions on tax cuts and infrastructure spending might not materializes as quickly as we want,” said Anastasia Amoroso, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in Houston. “The pronounced fall in yields across the world is not helping market sentiment at the moment either.” U.S. 10-year Treasury yields fell to three-week lows on Tuesday and the gap between U.S. and German 10-year government borrowing costs hit its narrowest since November. The S&P; 500 has run up about 10 percent since the election in November, spurred mainly by Trump’s agenda of tax cuts and infrastructure spending, but valuations have emerged as a concern. The benchmark index is trading at about 18 times forward earnings estimates against the long-term average of 15, according to Thomson Reuters data. At 9:38 a.m. ET (1338 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was down 23.89 points, or 0.12 percent, at 20,644.12, the S&P; 500 was down 0.11 points, or 0.00 percent, at 2,343.91. The Nasdaq Composite was up 9.55 points, or 0.16 percent, at 5,803.37. Five of the 11 major S&P; sectors were lower, with the financial index’s 1.32 percent fall leading the decliners. The sector, the top performer since the November election, suffered its worst daily drop since June on Tuesday. Bank of America, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo fell about 1 percent. Oil prices also dipped and slipped back to three-month lows after data showed U.S. crude inventories rising faster than expected. Gold prices rose to a three-week high and the dollar index , which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was at 99.78, near the six-week low of 99.64 reached on Tuesday. Sears Holdings slumped 11 percent to $8.18 after the retailer warned on Tuesday about its ability to continue as a going concern after years of losses and declining sales. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,598 to 976. On the Nasdaq, 1,268 issues fell and 984 advanced. The S&P; 500 index showed seven new 52-week highs and five new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded seven new highs and 30 new lows.

545,NKE,Serena Williams pregnancy likely to boost sponsorship -industry experts,"April 19 (Reuters) - A pregnant Serena Williams makes the tennis superstar even more attractive to corporate sponsors, allowing her to extend her reach into maternity wear and motherhood products, sponsorship industry executives said. Williams on Wednesday confirmed her pregnancy through spokeswoman Kelly Bush Novak after the tennis player posted a picture of herself in a yellow bathing suit on Snapchat social media with the caption “20 weeks.” Williams, 35, is already known around the world for her dominance of women’s tennis, but pregnancy would make her even more likeable in the eyes of the wider public, experts in the sponsorship industry said. “You take an iconic name who’s now a brand and you add pregnancy to it, you get a happy story,” said Gary Fechter, an attorney at McCarter & English who has represented companies in sponsorship deals. “This just makes her even more valuable.” With almost $29 million in salary and sponsorship earnings, including from Nike Inc and PepsiCo Inc, Williams ranked as the top paid female athlete in the world last year on a list compiled by Forbes magazine. But lower prize money in tennis left her 40th in the overall standings. However, her earnings from sponsorship deals alone, at $20 million, would rank her far higher on the Forbes list - tied at 20th with fellow tennis player Maria Sharapova. Williams could add to her earnings by appealing to new audiences, the experts said. Existing sponsors could tell new stories with an expecting superstar athlete, and new corporate sponsors might sign up with the mom-to-be as well. “This just adds another dimension to Serena the person,” said Jim Andrews, senior vice president with IEG, a WPP Plc unit that tracks sponsorship spending. Lawyer Fechter said there has not been an athlete of Williams’ prominence who stepped away while still dominant, but he pointed out that pregnancy only made non-sports celebrity Kim Kardashian more popular. “This will enhance her likeability and certainly her marketability,” Fechter said of Williams. Industry officials agreed no existing sponsor would ever drop Williams as a spokeswoman because she remains at the top of her sport and any move by a company to distance itself from a pregnant woman would likely be heavily panned by the public. In addition to Nike and Pepsi, Williams’ roster of sponsors includes Wilson Sporting Goods Co, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Apple Inc’s headphone company Beats Electronics, International Business Machines Corp and German automaker BMW’s Mini brand, according to IEG. Officials at Nike, JP Morgan, Pepsi and BMW could not be reached to comment. Existing clients could tap into new markets with a pregnant superstar athlete, industry experts said. Williams could even expand her clothing line marketed on HSN Inc into maternity wear. “There are a lot of different products and a lot of different brands that will feature families, motherhood, young kids and here’s somebody who would be potentially a great working mom if she continues her career,” said Doug Shabelman, president of Burns Entertainment, which matches celebrities with corporate sponsors.

After losing ground to its U.S. rival for years, Adidas launched a big marketing drive in the United States to challenge Nike on its home turf, prompting consumers to snap up its Boost running shoes and retro styles such as Superstars. Quarterly net profit rose 30 percent to 455 million euros ($496 million) on sales up 19 percent to 5.67 billion euros, beating average analyst forecasts. Adidas shares, which have already risen two-thirds over the last year to trade at a big premium to Nike, were up 1.5 percent at 184.95 euros at 0952 GMT after hitting a record high of 188.95 earlier on Thursday. Adidas, led since last October by Chief Executive Kaspar Rorsted, confirmed its 2017 forecast for sales growth of between 11 percent and 13 percent after accounting for currency fluctuations and net income to rise by as much as a fifth. “This implicitly suggests a slowdown in the earnings momentum in the coming quarters compared to the first quarter,” said DZ Bank Herbert Sturm as he cut his recommendation on the Adidas stock to “hold” from “buy”. Asked why he was not lifting the 2017 forecast after the strong quarter, Rorsted said Adidas had to make up for a one-off gain in 2016 from the early termination of a sponsorship deal with British soccer club Chelsea. He said the first-quarter had been helped by a shift in marketing spending to later in 2017.  He said Adidas was unlikely to meet a 2017 target for sales in Russia to rise 10 percent after a 10 percent fall in the first quarter, although he said that should not affect overall targets as Russia accounts for only 3 percent of group sales.  In its biggest markets, North America and China, Adidas sales rose 31 percent and 30 percent respectively, far ahead of the growth rates Nike reported for the quarter ended Feb. 28. Like German rival Puma (PUMG.DE), Adidas has been benefiting from a shift toward retro styles and away from basketball shoes which has hurt Nike as well as Under Armour (UAA.N). Adidas said quarterly growth was particularly strong in e-commerce, with revenues up 53 percent. Adidas announced a big push online in March, doubling its e-commerce sales target for 2020 to 4 billion euros from the 1 billion achieved in 2016. Adidas also reported a rebound at its struggling Reebok brand, with a 13 percent increase in sales, driven by the training category and retro styles. However, Rorsted said he did not expect it to keep up that pace for the full year as the first quarter had been helped by early product launches and the opening of new stores.

The European Commission announced the investigations on Wednesday but did not provide details of the sales practices. “Nike is aware of the European Commission’s investigation and will continue to cooperate with the authorities,” the company said. Universal Studios and Sanrio did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The EU move follows a year-long inquiry by its competition authority into e-commerce practices by 1,900 companies, part of a broader strategy to boost online trade and economic growth. The inquiry found that some companies allow their products to be sold online only by pre-selected distributors, while others use pricing restrictions and even online sales bans to block certain sellers. “We are going to examine whether the licensing and distribution practices of these three companies may be denying consumers access to wider choice and better deals in the single market,” European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. Nike is the licence rights holder for Barcelona soccer club merchandise, while Sanrio owns the Hello Kitty brand, which adorn items ranging from stationery to clothing. Universal Studios holds the rights for movies such as Minions and Despicable Me. The new investigations would cover similar issues to those of the e-commerce inquiry, but also include licensing of rights and offline distribution. “They complement the sector inquiry and other pending investigations in so far as they aim to tackle potential barriers to online and offline cross-border trade,” a Commission spokesman said, adding that the case had been brought by the EU executive rather than following a complaint. In February EU antitrust regulators opened three investigations into online sales of consumer electronics makers, video game makers and hotels.

Nike said it would reduce the number of its business segments to four from six as part of the initiative, being rolled out at a time the company is battling for market share in North America with a resurgent Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE) and a fast-growing Under Armour Inc (UAA.N). Shares of the world’s No.1 shoemaker were down 2.7 percent at $53.59 in early trading, making them the biggest percentage loser on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Under the plan, called “Consumer Direct Offense”, Nike will concentrate on 12 key cities in 10 countries, which are expected to represent over 80 percent of its projected growth through 2020. These cities include New York, Berlin, Paris and Barcelona. The company also said it would focus on newer styles, such as ZoomX, Air VaporMax and Nike React, and on categories with high growth potential, including running, basketball and soccer. While Nike still holds a 50 percent share of the U.S. market, Adidas’ retro Superstar shoes toppled Nike last year to become the top-selling sneakers in the United States.

563,NKE,Nike close to selling directly on Amazon: Goldman Sachs,"(Reuters) - Nike Inc’s (NKE.N) shares rose as much as 2 percent after Goldman Sachs said the world’s biggest sportswear maker could be close to selling directly on Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), raising competition for brick-and-mortar sporting goods retailers.  Nike, whose products are already sold on Amazon through third-party and unlicensed dealers, could build an additional $300 million to $500 million of revenue in the United States or 1 percent of its global sales through its expansion as a wholesale dealer on Amazon, Goldman Sachs said in a client note.  Through the partnership, Nike could weed out excess, discounted inventory available at the marketplace through third-party retailers and sell more full-price products through the online channel, according to the note.  Nike shares were the top percentage gainer among Dow-listed stocks. The stock has been the worst performer among Dow stocks over the past three months.  The news comes as Nike said it would cut 2 percent of its global workforce and eliminate a quarter of its shoe styles to become nimbler in the face of intensifying competition and fast-changing consumer trends.   “Taking this step would give Nike direct economic exposure to a large and fast growing distribution channel, while improving the brand presentation and expanding access to millennial shoppers,” Goldman analyst Lindsay Drucker Mann said.  A potential partnership would lead to more competition for sporting goods retailers such as Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc (DKS.N) that are seeing some market share gains due to the bankruptcies of The Sports Authority and other smaller, regional chains.  Shares of Dick’s Sporting fell as much as 8 percent in early trading to hit a near one-and-a-half-year low, while Hibbett Sports Inc (HIBB.O) fell as much as 6 percent to hit a more than seven-year low.  Other chains such as Finish Line Inc (FINL.O) hit a near 7 year low, while Foot Locker Inc (FL.N) hit a more than three year low.  “We expect pressures on bricks and mortar retail for the foreseeable future to result in pockets of inventory excess,” Drucker Mann said.

565,NKE,UPDATE 2-Nike to launch pilot program with Amazon; results top estimates,"(Reuters) - Nike Inc (NKE.N), the world’s largest footwear maker, said on Thursday it would launch a pilot program with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) to sell a limited product assortment on its website. Shares of the Dow component, which also reported quarterly profit and sales that topped estimates, were up 8.2 percent at $57.54 in trading after the bell. Nike’s comments confirmed an earlier report, which said the footwear maker was seeking to directly sell its products on Amazon, rather than through third-party and unlicensed dealers. “We’re looking for ways to improve the Nike consumer experience on Amazon by elevating the way the brand is presented and increasing the quality of product storytelling,” Nike Chief Executive Mark Parker said on a post-earnings call. Nike’s revenue could increase by $300 million to $500 million in the United States, or 1 percent in global sales, if the pilot turns into a more meaningful partnership, Goldman Sachs analyst Lindsay Drucker Mann said in a client note. Beaverton, Oregon-based Nike, which saw greater demand for its core brands including Jordan, and in sportswear and running categories, said its selling, general and administrative expenses fell 4 percent to $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter ended May 31.

566,NKE,Nike to launch pilot program with Amazon; results top estimates,"(Reuters) - Nike Inc (NKE.N), the world’s largest footwear maker, said on Thursday it would launch a pilot program with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) to sell a limited product assortment on its website. Shares of the Dow component, which also reported quarterly profit and sales that topped estimates, were up 8.2 percent at $57.54 in trading after the bell. Nike’s comments confirmed an earlier report, which said the footwear maker was seeking to directly sell its products on Amazon, rather than through third-party and unlicensed dealers. “We’re looking for ways to improve the Nike consumer experience on Amazon by elevating the way the brand is presented and increasing the quality of product storytelling,” Nike Chief Executive Mark Parker said on a post-earnings call. Nike’s revenue could increase by $300 million to $500 million in the United States, or 1 percent in global sales, if the pilot turns into a more meaningful partnership, Goldman Sachs analyst Lindsay Drucker Mann said in a client note.

567,NKE,Wall Street hit hard as tech softness continues,"(Reuters) - Wall Street fell sharply on Thursday, with the S&P; 500 and the Dow industrials suffering their worst daily percentage drops in about six weeks, as a recent decline in technology shares deepened and outweighed strength in bank shares. The technology sector .SPLRCT, which has led the S&P; 500’s 8-percent gain for the year, dropped 1.8 percent, and were the worst-performing major group. Declines in big tech stocks, including Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), weighed the most on the benchmark S&P.; Financials .SPSY and energy .SPNY were the only sectors in positive territory as investors may have been rotating into groups that have lagged this year. “U.S. equities have remained extended, at or close to record territory for an extended period of time really without a tremendous amount of conviction in the market,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York. “It’s really been treading water. Without a major stimulus to drive prices higher, equities have to reset and that’s what they’re doing today,” Kenny said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 167.58 points, or 0.78 percent, to 21,287.03, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 20.99 points, or 0.86 percent, to 2,419.7 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 90.06 points, or 1.44 percent, to 6,144.35. The Nasdaq closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since April 13, breaking below a key technical support level. The CBOE Volatility index .VIX, the widely followed barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, rose to a six-week high of 15.16, before paring some of the move. Equity investors also may be concerned about the rise in interest rates globally, as a slew of hawkish comments from central banks signaled the beginning of the end of ultra-loose monetary policy. European stocks also declined. With the second quarter coming to a close, the market has experienced a volatile few days. Just on Wednesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq had posted its best day since Nov. 7. Financials were the bright spot for the stock market, rising 0.7 percent. Bank stocks gained after the U.S. Federal Reserve approved the banks’ plans to raise dividend payouts and share buybacks under its annual stress test program. Wells Fargo (WFC.N) shares rose 2.7 percent while Citigroup (C.N) gained 2.8 percent. Energy inched 0.1 percent higher. Oil prices CLc1 edged up after a decline in weekly U.S. crude production temporarily eased concerns about oversupply. “There’s a slight rotation,” said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer for equities at Charles Schwab Investment Management. “You see the sectors that are underperforming are the ones that have done the best. Tech stocks are feeling the pain today, but it’s more of a technical reversal.”  Investors have been concerned about tepid U.S. economic growth as the Fed is raising interest rates from very low levels. Data showed the U.S. economy slowed less sharply in the first quarter than initially estimated due to unexpectedly higher consumer spending and a bigger jump in exports.  In corporate news, Rite Aid (RAD.N) shares slumped 26.5 percent after Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA.O) scrapped its deal to buy Rite Aid after failing to win antitrust approval, but said it would instead buy nearly half of the smaller rival’s U.S. stores. Walgreens also ended a related deal to sell as many as 1,200 Rite Aid stores to Fred’s Inc (FRED.O), sending Fred’s shares down 22.8 percent. Walgreens shares rose 1.7 percent. Blue Apron Holdings (APRN.N) shares ended flat in their market debut following the meal-kit delivery company’s watered down IPO in the shadow of Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) deal to buy Whole Foods Market WFM.N. Nike (NKE.N) shares rose after the market closed following the company’s quarterly results. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.38-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.69-to-1 ratio favored decliners. About 7.9 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the roughly 7.3 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Nike shares rose 11.3 percent after the world’s largest footwear maker reported a quarterly profit that topped estimates and said it would launch a pilot online sales program with Amazon.com. Nike shares gave the biggest boost to the Dow industrials and the S&P; 500. A pullback in biotech shares, which had surged of late, limited the Nasdaq’s gains. The S&P; technology index climbed 0.3 percent but was still on track to post its first monthly loss of the year. Tech has led the S&P; 500’s 8.4 percent rally this year, but its recent pullback suggests investors may be cashing in those profits to rotate to other sectors. “Are we going to see a broadening of the rally, where you see more of the financials and other sectors fill in some of the gaps?” said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc., an investment advisory firm in Toledo, Ohio. “It hasn’t been a broad encompassing rally that I think investors will have to see a little bit more conviction rather than just in a handful of stocks,” Lancz said.

With the second quarter coming to a close, the S&P; 500 was on track to record its biggest percentage first-half gain since climbing 12.6 percent in the first six months of 2013. U.S. consumer spending rose modestly in May and inflation cooled, pointing to a slow-but-steady economic expansion. The Commerce Department data bolstered the view that the U.S. economy is rebounding in the second quarter. Investors have been concerned about recent mixed economic data at a time that the Federal Reserve begins lifting interest rates from very low levels. “In the next four to six weeks we’ll get another set of economic data that will tell us if the Fed is justified in raising rates again this year,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.

The deal — which is expected to help Nike Inc (NKE.N) weed out counterfeit products sold through unlicensed dealers online and give it more control over its distribution — lifted the company’s shares to a more than three-month high on Friday. Nike’s move confirmed a June 21 report from Goldman Sachs that said the company would launch its products on the world’s largest online retailer. Since then shares of sporting goods retailer have fallen — Foot Locker Inc (FL.N) by nearly 2 percent, Hibbett Sports Inc (HIBB.O) by 6.8 percent and Big 5 Sporting Goods Inc (BGFV.O) by 5.3 percent. “They’re all scrambling right now,” Judge Graham, chief marketing officer of market research firm Ansira told Reuters. “The decision of Nike considering to sell directly to the consumer and that too with Amazon, they’re all getting nervous.”  Sporting goods retailers, which rely on Nike for a substantial part of their wholesale revenue, would be hit further in case Nike’s partnership with Amazon expands beyond the current pilot program. The sporting goods market is already in deep trouble, with several retailers such as Sports Authority already filing for bankruptcy, and Nike’s deal could push existing retailers to shut more stores, analysts said. Nike, whose products are already sold on Amazon through third-party and unlicensed dealers, could build an additional $300 million to $500 million of revenue in the United States or 1 percent of its global sales through its expansion as a dealer on Amazon, Goldman Sachs said in a client note.      But Nike still depends on the wholesale channel for two-thirds of its revenue and will be cautious about making any drastic shift to selling directly on Amazon, said John Zolidis, analyst at Quo Vadis Capital Inc.

Nike shares rose as much as 9.4 percent to a three-month high, after the world’s largest footwear maker said it would launch a pilot program with Amazon.com to sell a limited product assortment on its website. The Nasdaq biotech index was down 0.71 percent, dragged lower by Regeneron and Celgene. The S&P; technology index was up 0.28 percent but was still on track to post its biggest weekly loss in six months as worries about the sector’s valuation prompted investors to buy defensive stocks. “Tech has gone too far too fast and was due for a correction,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “The sector’s valuation is elevated but hasn’t reached a point of extreme concern because it is still a ‘buy-the-dip’ sector and is expected to grow further.” A fall in bank shares kept the financial sector flat with Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs dragging down the S&P; and the Dow.

The Nasdaq Composite was up 7.41 points, or 0.12 percent, at 6,151.76. The consumer discretionary index rose 0.72 percent and led the gainers among the major sectors.

Nike shares rose as much as 9.4 percent to a three-month high after the world’s largest footwear maker said it would launch a pilot program with Amazon.com to sell a limited product assortment on its website. The S&P; technology index was up 0.18 percent but was still on track to post its biggest weekly loss in six months as worries about the sector’s valuation prompted investors to buy defensive stocks. “Tech has gone too far too fast and was due for a correction,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “The sector’s valuation is elevated but hasn’t reached a point of extreme concern because it is still a ‘buy-the-dip’ sector and is expected to grow further.” A fall in bank shares also limited gains, with the financial sector down 0.1 percent. Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs were the biggest drags on the S&P; and the Dow. All three indexes are on track to post weekly losses. At 11:06 a.m. ET (1506 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 63.42 points, or 0.3 percent, at 21,350.45, the S&P; 500 was up 4.79 points, or 0.19 percent, at 2,424.49.

581,NKE,UPDATE 3-Sports Direct's optimism after profit slump propels shares,"* 2016-17 core earnings fall 29 percent * Still exposed to currency fluctuations * Targeting 5 pct-15 pct earnings growth in 2017-18 * New finance chief appointed * Shares rise as much as 8.6 percent (Adds detail, Ashley quote, analyst comment, updates shares) By James Davey LONDON, July 20 (Reuters) - British retailer Sports Direct reported a 29 percent slump in annual earnings, hurt by a weaker pound since the Brexit vote, but its shares soared on a forecast of growth this year and hopes management is finally getting its house in order. The sportswear chain, founded and run by billionaire Mike Ashley, has been heavily criticised for its treatment of workers and poor corporate governance. It was badly caught out by the fall in the pound after Britain’s vote to leave the European Union in June last year as it sources most of its products from Asia priced in dollars. Having failed to offset the risk of currency fluctuations for its 2016-17 financial year, the company put a hedge in place after the Brexit vote but that backfired too. It said it had now minimised the short-term impact of currency swings but remained exposed to fluctuations in the medium and long term. However, Ashley, who owns 62 percent of Sports Direct’s equity and wants to make the group the “Selfridges of sport”, said on Thursday he was encouraged by better than expected trading from the first batch of a new generation of flagship stores designed to showcase brands such as Adidas and Nike. The phrase refers to the British department store and Ashley’s desire to improve the look, feel and service of Sports Direct stores so that global sports brands let him sell their premium products, which has not always happened in the past. He gave two examples of the enhanced contribution to earnings of the new stores, telling analysts: “We’re smashing the ball out of the park on the ‘Selfridges of sport’ concept.” Sports Direct said its outlook was “optimistic” and targeted growth in underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 5 percent to 15 percent in the current 2017-18 year. Analysts had been expecting another decline. It still cautioned over short-term fluctuations in underlying EBITDA, “particularly given the continued uncertainty surrounding Brexit.” The stock, which lost half its value last year, jumped as much as 8.6 percent on Thursday, and was 7.8 percent higher at 324.5 pence at 1044 GMT, valuing the business at 1.72 billion pounds ($2.23 billion). “We have yet to hear such an upbeat outlook statement from any of the retailers so far this year,” said analysts at Peel Hunt, who have an “add” rating on the stock. “Generating a rise in gross profit would be a terrific achievement given that the pressure on underlying gross margins persists as the sales mix shifts away from own label towards third-party items,” they said. With investors and analysts crying out for new executive blood on Sports Direct’s board they also welcomed the appointment of a new finance chief - Jon Kempster, who has previously performed the same role at logistics group Wincanton. Sports Direct made underlying EBITDA of 272.7 million pounds in the year to April 30, ahead of its forecast of about 265 million pounds issued in December but well below the 381.4 million pounds made in 2015-16. Revenue increased 11.7 percent to 3.25 billion pounds but underlying pretax profit crashed 59 percent to 113.7 million pounds, reflecting both the currency movements and higher depreciation charges. No dividend is being paid. Sports Direct made no mention in its statement of its recent purchase of a 26 percent stake in Game Digital.

583,NKE,Puma to keep up spending on new stars in post-Bolt era,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German sportswear company Puma plans to keep spending to sign up top athletes and celebrities after its flagship star Usain Bolt retires, seeking to bolster a brand that lags market leaders Nike and Adidas. “We are continuing to invest in sports,” chief executive Bjorn Gulden told journalists after the company published full second-quarter results, adding that spending on marketing would remain between 10 and 12 percent of sales in the longer run. Appointed in 2013 by majority-owner French luxury goods company Kering, Gulden has invested heavily in celebrity marketing to turn around the Puma brand. For example, Usain Bolt has been at the center of a push to sell sports performance gear, also boosted by its sponsorship of English soccer side Arsenal. With the eight-times Olympic sprinting champion nearing his last race, the group has signed Canadian Olympic silver medalist Andre de Grasse as well as a number of Jamaican sprinters. Puma has also seen strong demand for products promoted by celebrities such as model Cara Delevingne and Canadian rapper The Weeknd. Earlier this month, it hiked its guidance for 2017 sales and operating profit as it announced a 16 percent jump in currency-adjusted second-quarter sales, led by demand for its shoes. Like German rival Adidas, which reports results on Aug. 3, Puma has been enjoying a revival in the U.S. market, helped by a shift towards retro styles and away from basketball shoes which has hurt Under Armour and dented Nike’s success. “The good thing is that the newer products are selling well, which means that we get a better margin,” CEO Gulden said. Puma’s operating margin jumped to 4.5 percent in the second quarter, from 1.4 percent in the year-earlier period, as its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) more than tripled to 43.4 million euros ($50.5 million). “In the beginning you have to over-invest relative to your sales. Now we are at the point where the leverage is kicking in, which means that for every euro of sales we are getting a bit more profit,” Gulden said. “But there is still room to improve, and we have to improve,” he added.

586,NKE,Adidas powers ahead in North America and China,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Adidas (ADSGn.DE) will pour more cash into marketing to try to stay ahead in the race with U.S. rivals Nike (NKE.N) and Under Armour (UAA.N), the German sportswear firm said on Thursday as it reported another quarter of bumper sales growth. Adidas will have an extra 700-800 million euros ($829-$948 million) to spend on marketing up to 2020 as sales grow fast, Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted said, pointing to a deal the company signed on Wednesday to extend its partnership with North America’s Major League Soccer (MLS). Adidas, which had already announced preliminary second-quarter results and raised its 2017 guidance last week, said sales grew 28 percent in China and 26 percent in North America, though they fell 11 percent in Russia. By contrast, Nike and Under Armour both reported flat North America sales in their latest quarters and said they would cut jobs to better compete. Adidas shares, which hit a record high of 194.15 euros on Aug. 1, were down 0.5 percent at 190.85 euros at 0927 GMT. Rorsted said Adidas was expanding its U.S. base in Portland, Oregon - near where Nike has its headquarters - and noted the firm received more than 300,000 job applications in the country in the first half of 2017. The Adidas retro basketball shoe Superstar was the top selling sneaker in the United States in 2016 and some analysts have expressed concern the German brand could suffer when that trend wanes. But Rorsted said new fashion styles like the NMD, Tubular and EQT were more than offsetting slowing demand for Superstars and Stan Smith retro tennis shoes. The NMD Runner and Tubular Shadow have joined the Superstar in the top 10 best-selling shoes in the United States, usually dominated by Nike, market intelligence firm NPD says.  Adidas running shoes are also flying off the shelves, with Rorsted saying capacity constraints mean it has been unable to keep up with demand for its springy Boost sneakers, with sales of the UltraBoost model more than doubling in the quarter.  Adidas still aims to keep marketing spending to about 13 percent of sales in 2017, with the budget weighted to the second half of the year after it underinvested in the first, a spokeswoman said. Rorsted declined to comment on reports the MLS deal is worth $700 million over six years.

590,NKE,Footwear retailers trampled as price war sparks concerns,"(Reuters) - Shares of sporting goods retailers were pummeled in early trading on Friday as dismal quarterly results from Hibbett and Foot Locker heightened investor concerns about a supply glut intensifying price wars in the industry. The results closely follow those of bigger rival Dick’s Sporting, which warned on Tuesday that its gross margins could possibly be pressured in perpetuity. Shares of Foot Locker (FL.N) slumped 26.1 percent, Hibbett Sports (HIBB.O) 18.3 percent, Finish Line (FINL.O) 12.5 percent, Dick’s (DKS.N) 3.2 percent and Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV.O) 3.3 percent. The results also weighed on shares of suppliers including Nike Inc (NKE.N), Adidas (ADSGn.DE) and Under Armour (UAA.N). Nike was down 3.8 percent and was the biggest drag on the Dow .DJI and the S&P; 500 .SPX.  “Athletic apparel and footwear is over-distributed and there is too much inventory in the channel,” John Zolidis, president of research firm Quo Vadis Capital Inc, wrote in a note. “We see potentially several years of retrenchment as supply is reduced to meet the new, lower level of demand.” Waning demand for basketball shoes, a steep drop in spending on sneakers, coupled with a pessimistic outlook for the back-to-school season have fueled investor worries over the industry’s path forward. Apparel traffic dropped over the past three months, with July seeing the steepest decline of 4.6 percent, according to checks by Cowen analysts. Traffic is down 4.1 percent in the first seven months of the year, the analysts said. Richard Johnson, the chief executive of Foot Locker, one of the largest sportswear chains in the United States, also blamed the lack of new innovative products in the market and expected the trend to continue through the year. Sportswear retailers typically have exclusive tie-ups with suppliers such as Nike and Adidas to showcase their latest and limited edition products that usually help attract younger shoppers. Also, looming over the industry is online retailer Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) push into newer areas. “The problem facing Sportsman’s Warehouse and Hibbett Sports is simple: Would a customer rather drive 30 minutes to one of their stores or stay home and buy from Amazon, especially with free shipping?” Nathan Yates, director of research at Forward View Consulting, said in an email. The industry is also struggling to clear inventory following a string of bankruptcies including those of Sports Authority, Performance Sports and Gander Mountain. “We predict several years of pain for the companies that compete in this arena,” Zolidis said.

591,NKE,US STOCKS-S&P; 500 index gains after recent selloff; energy stocks fall,"* Nike declines after analyst downgrade * Oil prices fall nearly 2.0 pct * Dow up 0.1 pct, S&P; up 0.1 pct, Nasdaq down 0.1 pct (Updates close with latest volume) By Kimberly Chin Aug 21 (Reuters) - The benchmark U.S. S&P; 500 stock index ended up slightly on Monday after two days of declines, though a drop in oil prices weighed on energy shares and tensions between the United States and North Korea kept investors on edge. Market participants began to turn their focus to the Federal Reserve meeting at Jackson Hole, Wyoming later this week which will be attended by Fed Chair Janet Yellen, European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, and other global central bankers. Investors are looking for further direction on where monetary policy is headed given persistently low inflation in the U.S. and Europe. Fed Vice Chair William Dudley, who has in the past supported accommodative monetary policy, earlier this month said that the recent easing in financial conditions, despite Fed interest rate increases, is a reason to keep plans to tighten policy in place. “That confluence of strong growth and low inflation, which is somewhat like nirvana for equity investors, we don’t think can last forever,” said Wayne Wicker, chief investment officer at ICMA-RC in Washington. “We’re hopefully getting a couple of more data points to see where the Fed takes their temperature on where they’re feeling the economy is at this juncture so that we can anticipate if something happens in the fourth quarter or not.” Geopolitical concerns are still weighing on investor sentiment also. The United States and South Korea began their annual autumn joint military exercises on Monday, heightening tensions with North Korea, which called the drills a “reckless” step toward nuclear conflict. Absent U.S. economic data or other headlines, “it’s a quiet Monday and people are still feeling the effects of last week. Now that earnings are over, there’s just not a whole lot of catalysts,” said Ian Winer, head of equities at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. U.S. stock futures trading volume fell during the two hours that people left their offices to get a glimpse of the first total solar eclipse to unfold across the country in nearly a century. About 174,000 S&P; 500 e-mini futures futures changed hands over the two hour period ending 3:30 p.m. E.T. on Monday, down about 46 percent for the comparable period last year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 29.24 points, or 0.13 percent, to 21,703.75, the S&P; 500 gained 2.82 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,428.37 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.40 points, or 0.05 percent, to 6,213.13.

592,NKE,US STOCKS-S&P; 500 gains after two days of declines; energy falls,"* Nike declines after analyst downgrade * Oil prices fall nearly 2 pct * Dow up 0.1 pct, S&P; up 0.1 pct, Nasdaq down 0.1 pct (Updates to close) By Kimberly Chin Aug 21 (Reuters) - The S&P; 500 ended up slightly on Monday after two days of declines, though simmering tensions between the United States and North Korea kept investors on edge and a drop in oil prices weighed on energy shares. Investors began to turn their focus to the Jackson Hole meeting of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and other global central bankers, due to start later this week. Investors are angling for the slightest hint on where monetary policy is headed. Fed Vice Chair William Dudley, who has in the past taken a more dovish approach to policymaking, earlier this month said the fact that financial conditions have recently eased despite Fed rate increases is a reason to keep plans to tighten policy in place. “That confluence of strong growth and low inflation, which is somewhat like nirvana for equity investors, we don’t think can last forever,” said Wayne Wicker, chief investment officer at ICMA-RC in Washington. “We’re hopefully getting a couple of more data points to see where the Fed takes their temperature on where they’re feeling the economy is at this juncture so that we can anticipate if something happens in the fourth quarter or not.” The United States and South Korea began long-planned joint military exercises on Monday, heightening tensions with North Korea, which called the drills a “reckless” step toward nuclear conflict. Tensions between the United States and North Korea and turmoil in the White House have caused stocks to sell off in the past two weeks. Absent U.S. economic data or other headlines, “it’s a quiet Monday and people are still feeling the effects of last week. Now that earnings are over there’s just not a whole lot of catalysts,” said Ian Winer, head of equities at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. Stock futures trading volume fell during the two hours that people left their offices to get a glimpse of the first total solar eclipse to unfold across the country in nearly a century. About 174,000 S&P; 500 e-mini futures futures changed hands in the two-hour period ending 3:30 p.m. E.T. on Monday, down about 46 percent from the comparable period last year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 29.24 points, or 0.13 percent, to 21,703.75, the S&P; 500 gained 2.82 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,428.37 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.40 points, or 0.05 percent, to 6,213.13. The S&P; 500 energy index was down 0.6 percent, leading sector declines in the S&P; 500, after crude oil prices fell nearly 2 percent, pulling back from last week’s rally. While the benchmark S&P; 500 index is still up 13.5 percent since the election, it had fallen 2.1 percent in the last two weeks. That’s the most since the two weeks before the election. The Dow ended above its 50-day moving average after briefly falling below it during the session, while the S&P; 500 remained below the 50-day technical level.

Last week, President Donald Trump fired chief strategist Steve Bannon and disbanded some business councils, among other political maneuvers, that led to investor concerns about the Trump administration’s ability to implement its pro-growth agenda. While the benchmark S&P; 500 index is still up about 13.5 percent since the election, it had fallen 2.1 percent in the last two weeks. That’s the most since the fortnight before the election. Part of the recent decline was due to escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea. While that has eased slightly in the past few days, South Korean and U.S. forces began computer-simulated military exercises on Monday. “I think (the market’s decline) is a continuation of the weakness we’ve seen in the last couple of weeks,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. “We have come off a really strong period for the market and are really just digesting the gains.” At 11:00 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 22.4 points, or 0.1 percent, at 21,652.11 and the S&P; 500 was down 1.79 points, or 0.07 percent, at 2,423.76. The Nasdaq Composite was down 24.30 points, or 0.39 percent, at 6,192.23. The Dow’s drop pulled it below its 50-day moving average, meaning that all three indexes were trading below the key technical measure on the same day for the first time since April 18. Three of the 11 S&P; sectors were lower, led by the technology index’s 0.63 percent decline and financial’s 0.53 percent drop. Defensive sectors such as real estate and telecommunications were the top gainers. Apple’s 0.6 percent drop weighed the most on the S&P; and the Nasdaq, while Nike’s 2.62 percent slide dragged the most on the Dow. Jefferies cut its rating and price target on Nike. Oil prices fell sharply as a rally at the end of last week prompted investors to close positions at a higher price. Herbalife was up 10.88 percent after the nutritional supplement maker said it would buy back $600 million of shares after ending talks to be taken private. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,448 to 1,260. On the Nasdaq, 1,736 issues fell and 947 advanced.

594,NKE,Lululemon is leaning toward men to bolster growth,"(Reuters) - Lululemon Athletica Inc is coming off two straight quarters of solid growth and is forging ahead with expansion plans that include a focus on menswear, a move that could breathe life into an ailing athleisure market. In targeting men, the company has jumped into an arena dominated by the likes of Nike Inc and Under Armour Inc, and expects a billion dollar business for that division by 2020. “Men’s is still one of our best-kept secrets,” Chief Executive Officer Laurent Potdevin said on a post-earnings conference call on Thursday with analysts. Known for its yoga-inspired clothing, Lululemon’s lean toward men could be a good strategy, especially as rivals struggle in a lackluster market for athleisure gear - casual clothing designed for both exercise and everyday wear. “In successfully pivoting from being a women’s brand to one that now appeals to both genders, Lululemon stands in marked contrast to Under Armour, which has seen only limited success in attracting women,” analyst Neil Saunders of GlobalData Retail said. “This augurs well for the future as we believe Lululemon has much more runway with male shoppers.” The company is prominently displaying men’s merchandise like its popular anti-ball crushing (ABC) pants and “anti-stink” items in its stores. Its new ABC swimming gear has also sold well. Lululemon’s shares were up 7 percent at $61.72 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, a day after the company raised its full-year revenue forecast on strong demand for women’s clothes. The men’s division gained traction as well, driven by a 23 percent jump in sales of pants and shorts. Vancouver-based Lululemon does not break out sales for the overall men’s business, but analysts at JP Morgan said it accounts for about 13 percent to 14 percent of total sales. Lululemon will debut its first dedicated marketing strategy for men in September, as part of its global “This is Yoga” campaign, launched in May. Lululemon’s plan to go after men hits Nike, Under Armour and Gap Inc’s Athleta brand, and could also impact sales at retailers such as Dicks Sporting Goods. “We believe weakness in Nike and Under Armour North America apparel sales creates share gain opportunity for Lululemon,” analyst Rafe Jadrosich of Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a note earlier this month. Lululemon is much smaller than Nike and Under Armour - Evercore analyst Omar Saad said the brand sold around 30 million units in North America over the last 12 months, compared with 100 million for Under Armour and Nike’s 350 million. “Nike and Under Armour have suffered from a lack of innovation, over-distribution in moderate channels, and heavy promotions,” Jadrosich said.

595,NKE,Judge tosses workers' class action against Nike over security checks,"A federal judge on Tuesday said Nike Inc’s retail arm was not required to pay workers in California for the few seconds each day that they spent going through security checks, and tossed out a class action against the company. U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman in San Jose said Oregon-based Nike had shown that the 10,000 class members spent an average of 18 seconds being inspected before they left retail stores, and that amount of time was “de minimis” and not compensable under California law.

597,NKE,Nike posts slowest quarterly sales growth in nearly 7 years,"(Reuters) - Nike Inc (NKE.N) posted its slowest quarterly sales growth in nearly seven years in the face of intensifying competition from Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE) and said it expects a further drop in revenue from North America. Shares of the Dow component were trading down 3.7 percent at $51.71 after the bell on Tuesday. Nike is battling pressures on many fronts - in North America a reinvigorated Adidas has taken market share, while athleisure, a decade-long trend that saw shoppers wear sports apparel for formal and informal occasions, has been fading. Certain retailers may respond to the weak demand in North America through door closures and potential discontinuities, which could lead to contraction of revenue in the market in the current quarter, Nike said on a post-earnings call. Beaverton, Oregon-based Nike also said it expects its second-quarter revenue to grow in the low single-digit percentage range. Bankruptcies from Sports Authority and Sports Chalet earlier in the year have seen Nike’s distribution channels weaken and those that remain - sporting goods retailers such as Finish Line Inc (FINL.O) and Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc (DKS.N) - have called out sharp falls in store visits and the need to cut prices to battle online competition. Finish Line, earlier this year, had also pointed out a lack of innovation in shoe styles in the market from footwear makers to have dampened demand. Nike’s gross margins fell 1.8 percent to 43.7 percent, while inventory was up 6 percent in the first quarter ended Aug. 31, driven by higher off-price sales. Revenue from North America, the company’s largest revenue contributor, fell 3 percent - its first decline in more than 10 quarters. However, Nike said it banked on international sales to meet its mid single-digit revenue growth target for the year. Sales from Greater China rose 9 percent and revenue from the Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region grew 4 percent in the quarter. Total revenue rose marginally to $9.07 billion, while Nike said it earned 57 cents per share.

601,NKE,UPDATE 1-Nike's road to recovery in North America likely a long one,"(Reuters) - Nike Inc’s (NKE.N) fight to claw back market share in an intensifying U.S. sneaker price war is still some way off bearing fruit, analysts said on Wednesday, a day after the sportswear giant reported its weakest quarterly sales growth in nearly seven years.   At least nine brokerages cut their price targets on the stock after Nike warned of a further fall in revenue in its biggest market following a 3 percent drop in the first quarter that was its first outright decline in 2-1/2 years. Nike shares fell as much as 5 percent to $51.03 in morning trading, its lowest since mid June, and pulled down shares of rival Under Armour Inc (UAA.N).  Nike's stock was also the top percentage loser on the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI on Wednesday.  Analysts from some of the world’s major brokerages remain upbeat on the company’s plans to invest in a variety of different distribution channels but say it will happen too slowly to offset the growing battle for market share. European rival Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE) has continued to snap at Nike’s heels, even if the latter’s North American business is still more than three times larger. Both face growing competition from others including Under Armour Inc (UAA.N). “We are seeing price points on Nike, Adidas and Under Armour product that we never thought possible in N.America,” Cowen & Co analyst John Kernan wrote in a note, cutting his price target on the stock to $50 from $53. U.S. sports good chains have been shutting stores and cutting prices as fewer shoppers visit malls and online shopping grows.  Nike still gets about 70 percent of its revenue from retail customers but has been investing heavily in e-commerce, partnering with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and offering heavy discounts on its own website.   Tuesday’s results showed a 6 percent rise in inventories, which suggests the company is building up more stock to sell through online channels but may also indicate lower sales through traditional outlets.  Gross margins fell 1.8 percent to 43.7 percent, pointing to greater discounting in a market Nike warned would shrink overall in the current quarter as more stores shut.  “We expect challenges to remain in North America for at least several more quarters,” Moody’s analyst Mike Zuccaro said. J.P. Morgan analysts said they expected the sales picture likely to get worse before getting better.   The spate of price target cuts by brokers lowered its median price target to $61.74, down 2.7 percent from just a month ago, Thomson Reuters data shows. Sentiment on the stock has been steady for three months, with 21 “buy” or higher ratings, 14 “hold” and 2 “sell”, the data shows.     Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser was the most bearish on the stock after the results, cutting his price target by $7 to $47. “Ultimately, we believe Nike’s U.S. business will get back on track, but we are unsure how long it will take as we don’t believe solutions are fully in place,” Poser said.

Trump will call for slashing tax rates on businesses and the wealthy as part of the new plan, which, if passed, would be his first significant legislative win since taking office in January. “The market really would like to see something positive done. And, right now, tax reform is the only positive thing out there,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. “If they manage to get through to a revenue neutral plan, that is going to be received positively, it will make it that much easier to pass.” U.S. stocks have rallied since Trump’s presidential victory last year mainly on hopes of lower taxes, higher infrastructure spending and looser regulation. The dollar rose to a one-month high against a basket of currencies on rising expectations of a third interest rate hike this year following comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. Yellen said on Tuesday that it would be “imprudent” to keep rates on hold until U.S. inflation hit the 2 percent target. Traders now see an 81.4 percent chance of a December rate hike, compared with 71.4 percent a week ago, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Shares of major banks including Bank of America, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs were up more than 1 percent in premarket trading. Commerce Department data showed new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased more than expected in August and shipments maintained their upward trend, pointing to underlying strength in the economy despite an anticipated drag to growth from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.9 percent last month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast orders increasing 0.3 percent. At 8:34 a.m. ET (1234 GMT), Dow e-minis were up 27 points, or 0.12 percent, with 17,830 contracts changing hands.

Puma’s shares jumped 4 percent after the unscheduled announcement. The company is due to report full quarterly results on Oct. 24. Like its German rival Adidas (ADSGn.DE), which reports results on Nov. 9, Puma has been enjoying a revival in the U.S. market, as shoppers snap up its fashion instead of basketball shoes, hurting Under Armour (UAA.N) and Nike (NKE.N). Nike Inc last month posted its slowest quarterly sales growth in nearly seven years in the face of the intensifying competition from Adidas and Puma and a looming price war amid sporting goods retailers. Puma said third-quarter sales rose about 17 percent to 1.122 billion euros ($1.32 billion), compared with an average analyst forecast for 1.091 billion euros, according to Thomson Reuters Smart Estimates. Puma said it was raising its outlook for currency-adjusted sales for the full year, to an increase of 14 to 16 percent from a previous 12 to 14 percent, due to the strong figures as well as the positive fourth-quarter outlook. It now expects full-year earnings before interest and taxation of 235 million to 245 million euros, up from previous guidance of 205 million to 215 million and compared with average analyst forecasts of 217 million euros.

607,NKE,"Nike gives upbeat forecast at investor conference, shares rise","(Reuters) - Nike Inc (NKE.N) said on Wednesday it expects earnings per share to grow in the mid-teens over the next five years, driven by online sales and new product categories, sending its shares up by about three percent. The stock was the top gainer on the Dow on a day when the broader market was down. Nike Chief Executive Mark Parker said at an investor conference that he expects digital revenues to grow from 15 to 30 percent over five years, while revenue growth would be up in the high-single digits over the same period. The company has already set a target of $50 billion in annual sales by 2020. The sports-wear giant said at the conference it expects about 50 percent of its future sales growth to come from new categories and about 75 percent growth from outside the U.S. Nike posted its weakest quarterly sales growth in nearly seven years in September as it fights to retain market share from rivals like Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE). Analysts have remained upbeat on the company’s plans to invest in a variety of different distribution channels but have cautioned that it may come too late as the company struggles with declining revenue in North America.

America sales * Celgene falls after follicular lymphoma regimen fails trial * Indexes down: S&P; 0.01 pct, Nasdaq 0.15 pct, Dow 0.05 pct (Updates to open) By Sruthi Shankar Dec 22 (Reuters) - Wall Street was little changed on Friday, with a more than 4 percent drop in Nike’s shares countering gains in consumer staple stocks. Nike forecast muted current-quarter revenue growth on Thursday, highlighting its struggles to regain market share in North America from Adidas. The stock dragged down the S&P; consumer discretionary index , which was the biggest loser among the 11 major S&P; sectors, with a 0.34 percent fall. However, the staples index was helped by a 0.7 percent rise in Procter & Gamble and a 0.4 percent gain in Philip Morris. Major Wall Street indexes were on track to end the week higher, buoyed by a historic overhaul of the U.S. tax code that is expected to benefit corporates due to a significant tax cut. Investors were also relieved after the U.S. Congress averted a government shutdown on Thursday just one day before federal funding was due to expire. “We’re in a bullish phase and investors have things to feel good about - a strong economy as witnessed by a 3.2 percent growth in GDP, a tax plan that is all but signed,” said Andres Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC  in Bernardsville, New Jersey. “The tax plan will add more credibility to the Republican government and will be used as a leverage to get more things done.” Volumes are expected to be muted on Friday ahead of the Christmas holiday on Monday. At 9:36 a.m. ET (1436 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 13.57 points, or 0.05 percent, at 24,768.72 and the S&P; 500 was down 0.33 points, or 0.01 percent, at 2,684.24. The Nasdaq Composite was down 10.72 points, or 0.15 percent, at 6,954.64. Data on Friday showed U.S. consumer spending accelerated in November and shipments of key capital goods orders increased for the 10th straight month, the latest signs of strong momentum in the economy as the year winds down. Wildly volatile bitcoin plunged below $13,000, losing around a third of its market value in five days. Companies that have been trying to ride the bitcoin wave were hit hard by the cryptocurrency’s slump.

Nike Inc shares fell 2.5 percent after the company forecast muted growth in current-quarter revenue, reflecting its struggles in the North American market. UnitedHealth Group Inc was down 0.7 percent after the health insurer agreed to buy Chilean healthcare company Banmedica SA for $2.8 billion. Investors are winding down ahead of the Christmas holiday on Monday, when the market will be closed. “It’s been a strong week,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “Whether the market is up a little bit or down a little bit is not indicative of larger trends...It’s easy to push things around when not many people are trading.” Indeed, major Wall Street indexes were on track to end the week higher, buoyed by a historic overhaul of the U.S. tax code. President Donald Trump signed Republicans’ massive $1.5 trillion tax overhaul into law on Friday and also approved a short-term spending bill that averts a possible government shutdown. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 36.02 points, or 0.15 percent, to 24,746.27, the S&P; 500 lost 1.9 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,682.67 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.03 points, or 0.09 percent, to 6,959.33. Wildly volatile bitcoin plunged below $12,000, losing around a third of its market value in five days. It since has stabilized above $13,000. Companies that have been riding the bitcoin wave were hit hard by the cryptocurrency’s slump. Long Blockchain Corp, Overstock.com Inc, Riot Blockchain Inc and Marathon Patent Group Inc tumbled between 2 percent and 15 percent. Data on Friday showed U.S. consumer spending went up in November and shipments of key capital goods orders increased for the 10th straight month, confirming strong economic momentum. “The data is relatively mixed but biased to the upside, and consumer sentiment continues to be strong and that bodes well for economic strength in 2018,” said Matthew Miskin, market strategist at John Hancock Investments in Boston, Massachusetts. The benchmark S&P; has climbed about 20 percent this year and is on track for its best performance since 2013 on solid corporate earnings, strong economic fundamentals, upcoming cuts to corporate tax rates and hopes of looser regulations. Real estate led the S&P; 500 in gains, with a 0.7 percent rise. Health was the biggest decliner, falling 0.4 percent. Celgene Corp shares fell 1.9 percent after the company’s follicular lymphoma regimen failed in a clinical trial. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.15-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.27-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

Nike shares dropped more than 4 percent after it forecast muted current-quarter revenue growth, highlighting its struggles to regain market share in North America from Adidas. UnitedHealth slid 0.7 percent after the health insurer agreed to buy Chilean healthcare company Banmedica SA for $2.8 billion. Despite the dip, Wall Street was poised to end the week higher after rallying sharply ahead of a $1.5 trillion tax cut bill that passed in Washington on Wednesday. U.S. President Donald Trump signed the tax overhaul into law on Friday. Stock markets around the world shot higher as the law, seen as boosting corporations and leading to economic growth, advanced through both chambers of the Republican-dominated Congress. “We’re in a bullish phase and investors have things to feel good about,” said Andres Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Investors were also winding down ahead of the Christmas holiday on Monday. “Volumes in the stock market are down 28 percent,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 48.91 points, or 0.2 percent, to 24,733.38, the S&P; 500 lost 2.78 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,681.79 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 8.01 points, or 0.11 percent, to 6,957.35. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.02 percent. In Europe, the premium investors demand for holding Spanish bonds over top-rated German peers fell to its lowest in almost three months as Catalonia held an independence election. The euro dipped to $1.1817 early in the day, before trimming its losses to trade at $1.1835. Spanish stocks were among the biggest losers, confirming analyst expectations that any shake-out from the Catalonia vote would be mostly confined to Spain. Europe’s common currency, though, was still up nearly 13 percent so far this year, on track for its best yearly performance in 14 years. U.S. Treasury yields, which reached a nine-month peak after the American tax vote, pushed slightly higher as investors hung up their hats before Christmas. The yield curve, while mildly flatter on the day, was on track for its largest weekly steepening since July following the bill’s passage, which was seen as hastening the pace of interest rate increases. Investors appeared to brush off U.S. data on durable goods orders, personal spending, new home sales and consumer sentiment. Next week, investors will watch for the release of December U.S. consumer confidence survey data. Economists polled by Reuters expect it to decline from its strongest levels since late 2000. In commodities, oil prices dipped in light trading but remained near their highest levels since 2015 on pledges from OPEC leader Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC producer Russia that any exit from crude output cuts would be gradual. In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin once again became the most eye-catching mover, this time because of losses. Bitcoin plunged as much as 25 percent on the day at one point to below $12,000, having lost a third of its value since Sunday.

The week’s highlight was a historic overhaul of the U.S. tax code, which is expected to benefit corporates due to a significant cut in the amount levied on businesses, hopes of which have sparked a rally in shares this year.

Wall Street’s main indexes rose on Thursday, boosted by bank and oil stocks after data showed the U.S. economy grew in the third quarter at its fastest pace in more than two years. A report on Friday showed U.S. consumer spending accelerated in November amid an increase in demand for recreational goods and utilities. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, rose 0.1 percent in November and lifted the annualized core PCE to 1.5 percent from 1.4 percent reported in October.

618,NKE,Nike's North America weakness to weigh on current-quarter revenue,"(Reuters) - Nike Inc (NKE.N) forecast on Thursday muted current-quarter revenue growth, highlighting the world’s largest footmaker’s struggles to regain market share in North America from a resurgent Adidas (ADSGn.DE). The company also said it expects gross margins in the current quarter to shrink by 125 to 175 basis points due to stronger dollar and higher costs related to new launches. “In third quarter in particular, we expect reported revenue growth at or slightly below the rate of reported revenue growth that we delivered in the second quarter,” Elliott Hill, President of Geographies and Sales said in a post-earnings call. The dismal forecast comes despite the company’s all-out effort to sell its shoes at higher prices in North America where it is facing tough competition. Shares of the company, a Dow component, were marginally down at $63.74 in after-hours trading. They have surged about 25 percent from their year-low in October. In the reported quarter, Nike’s North America revenue fell 5 percent - its second-straight quarter of declines - hurt by its decision to sell more sneakers at full price and severe competition from a resurgent Adidas (ADSGn.DE). “They are still working through a restructure of their business in North America and we probably won’t see positives in the next quarter,” Jessica Ramirez, retail research analyst at Jane Hali & Associates said in an email. Weakening wholesale distribution channels due to bankruptcies of sports chains Sports Authority and Sports Chalet earlier this year also hurt the company’s revenue.  In response, Nike has been focusing on sales through its stores and website and its pilot program with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) to sell a limited product assortment.    Online sales rose 29 percent in the second quarter. The company has set a target to increase share of digital sales to total revenue to about 30 percent from 15 percent over the next five years. Nike’s international market, however, has been a bright spot, helping the company offset declining sales in North America. Quarterly revenue from Greater China rose 16 percent and European region 19 percent in the second quarter. The sportswear giant has said it expected about 50 percent of its future sales growth to come from new categories and about 75 percent growth from outside the United States. Nike has also been stepping up its advertising to regain market share from Adidas’ retro Superstar and Ultraboost shoes. Finish Line (FINL.O) said earlier on Thursday that Nike’s VaporMax and retro styles such as Huarache and Huarache ULTRA sold well in the sporting goods retailer’s third quarter.  Excluding one-time items, the Beaverton, Oregon-based company earned 46 cents per share on revenue of $8.55 billion.

622,NKE,RPT-UPDATE 2-Luxury group Kering to spin off Puma to its own shareholders,"FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Gucci-owner Kering (PRTP.PA) plans to spin off German sports brand Puma (PUMG.DE) to the French conglomerate’s shareholders to focus squarely on its luxury brands.  Kering said on Thursday it planned to distribute 70 percent of Puma shares to its investors, leaving it with only a 16 percent stake, confirming an exclusive Reuters report. Puma shares were down 4.4 percent at the close as some investors worried about the company losing a powerful backer.  Kering stock was down almost 1 percent. The deal comes after a recent turnaround at Puma, which struggled for years following Kering’s 5.3 billion euros ($6.4 billion) purchase in 2007.  The French firm, meanwhile, has long wanted to focus purely on its high-margin luxury business, where it rivals larger groups such as French conglomerate LVMH (LVMH.PA).  “We found ourselves in a sort of imbalance, linked to the outperformance of the luxury sector,” Kering’s finance chief Jean-Marc Duplaix told journalists, adding the group would also look at options to shed its remaining sportswear label, Volcom.  Kering is a little more than 40 percent controlled by France’s Pinault family, which would receive about 29 percent of the sporting goods company, while Puma’s free float would stand at about 55 percent.  The French company was retaining a stake in Puma to reap some benefits from the brand’s recovery, Duplaix said, as Kering will make no cash gains from the deal.  The price of the transaction, which will be put to Kering shareholders in April at the group’s annual meeting, has yet to be determined, he said.  The disposal was likely to be a boost for Kering shares, analysts said.  “The Puma divestiture materializing sooner - rather than later - will add oomph to the stock,” Exane BNP Paribas analyst Luca Solca said in a note Under Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden, appointed in 2013, Puma has refocused on its core sports business after sales were hurt by a shift into fashion products, ousting Nike as sponsor of English soccer club Arsenal. A distant third in the global sportswear market behind Nike and Adidas, Puma has focused on the world’s most popular sports, such as soccer, running and motorsport, and launched a new drive to tap into booming sales of women’s sportswear by appointing singer Rihanna as creative director in 2014.     Puma said it welcomed the transaction because it increases the company’s free float - or freely tradable shares. It added the move would not affect its current strategy.  Puma will likely now be a candidate for inclusion in Germany’s mid-cap index .MDAXI, Duplaix said.  The sports goods company is due to report full-year results on Feb. 12, having increased its profit guidance three times last year on the popularity of the collections designed by Rihanna, and shoes worn by Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt. Like German rival Adidas (ADSGn.DE), Puma has enjoyed a revival in the United States as shoppers snap up its retro styles instead of basketball shoes, hurting Nike (NKE.N) and Under Armour (UAA.N). Puma’s shares have risen by 45 percent over the past year, bringing its market capitalization to 5.3 billion euros, back at the level at which Kering bought.  Kering emerged as one of the big winners in a luxury goods revival last year as Chinese demand picked up, with a stellar turn at brand-of-the-moment Gucci helping earnings, and other labels such as Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga doing well.

623,NKE,Subway-themed sports shoes are just the ticket for Berliners,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Dozens of sports shoe enthusiasts stormed Adidas stores in Berlin on Tuesday to snatch a pair of shoes launched in collaboration with the public transport network that incorporate the same pattern as the subway’s seats, as well as an annual ticket. Adidas is selling just 500 pairs of the shoes for 180 euros  ($220) each to coincide with the 90th anniversary of the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) public transport company.  The shoes - an updated version of the EQT shoes originally launched in 1993 that were popular with east Germans after the fall of the Berlin Wall - have a season ticket valid for 2018 sewn into the tongue of the shoes, normally worth 730 euros.  “How cool is that?” said BVG chairwoman Sigrid Nikutta. “It’s great that the BVG, which is celebrating its 90th birthday this year, is now becoming a style icon itself.” The Berlin public transport company has revamped its image in recent years with a series of quirky ads and social media campaigns that have gone viral. It already sells bags and other accessories with its swirling red, black and blue seat pattern. “I already have a buyer who will pay 850 euros,” said Nikita Dutschenko, a young man who said he was missing school to wait in line with dozens of others who camped out overnight in sub-zero temperatures. “You can make good money out of it.” Rival Nike has previously collaborated with the London underground on several sneaker lines using its patterns and fonts, including to mark its 150th anniversary in 2013.

626,NKE,Nike at two-year high as analysts tout margin benefits of direct sales,"(Reuters) - Nike Inc’s (NKE.N) shares surged to a two-year high on Friday after two Wall Street brokerages said the footwear maker’s profitability would soon reap the benefits of its recent move to sell directly to consumers. Nike’s shares jumped nearly 5 percent, set for their best day since June 30, 2017, when the company said it would sell more products directly through retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and its own stores, rather than through wholesalers. Bernstein Research and Wedbush Securities said this direct-to-consumer (DTC) model would boost Nike’s margins once the plans were fully implemented and the business accounted for a larger chunk of total sales from the current 28 percent. In fact, Wedbush estimated Nike’s overall gross margins would expand for the first time in 10 quarters in the March-May quarter. It upgraded Nike’s stock to “outperform.” Analyst Christopher Svezia said the company’s results next fiscal would also get a boost from the launch of new shoe styles and easier comparison with last year, when it took a bit of a beating from weak demand in North America. Bernstein estimated said Nike’s realized retail price was double its wholesale price, suggesting the gross profit contribution of each product it sold directly was more than three times higher than if sold through a wholesaler. “As Nike moves from a wholesale business to a more direct business, we believe there is clear margin upside from this shift,” analyst Jamie Merriman wrote in a note. Merriman estimated gross margins in Nike’s DTC business are 62 percent, compared with 38 percent in its wholesale business. Nike’s overall gross margins could grow by as much as 3.3 percentage points by 2022, Merriman estimated, if the DTC business increased to about 42 percent of total revenue. That growth would be even more if margins in its e-commerce business scale to those in its store business, Merriman said, who rates Nike’s stock “outperform.” The company's shares were up 4.5 percent at $66.98, easily the top gainer on the bluechip Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI. The stock rose to as much as $67.14, its highest since December 2015.

627,NKE,"Ackman made new bet on Nike, Namvar to transition to advisory board","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman said on Thursday that his hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management made a new bet on sportswear company Nike last year that has already earned his portfolio a roughly 30 percent return. For months the activist investor has been saying he had new ideas for his portfolio, and on Thursday he spoke about them publicly for the first time at his firm’s annual client dinner, an investor in the firm said. At the dinner, Ackman also said that Ali Namvar, one of Pershing Square Capital Management’s most senior investment team members, will be moving to the firm’s advisory board. Ackman, one of the world’s most closely watched activist investors whose bets have often helped push up a target company’s share price, bought Nike when it was trading around $53 a share. It closed trading on Thursday at $67.71. The bet on Nike is unusual in that Ackman has no plans to push the company’s management to make changes, leaving it as one of his few “passive investments.” Pershing Square, which oversees roughly $9 billion for clients, has suffered three years of losses, and Ackman plans to spend more time generating ideas and focusing on investments in a bid to help revive performance. He will leave the marketing of the firm, which often involves a lot of travel, to other partners, Reuters reported on Monday. Nike previously caught the eye of other hedge funds. Hoplite Capital founder John Lykouretzos presented it to an industry conference in May as one of his best ideas, and said the stock price could double within three years amid strong international growth.  For years, any word from Ackman about new names often sent stock prices higher as investors expected him to push for better returns and possibly shake up management. Ackman said Namvar, who is also a board member at portfolio company Chipotle Mexican Grill, will join Pershing Square’s advisory board in a few months, leaving the day to day investment business to pursue a second career in the music industry. He will continue to sit on the CMG board, Ackman said.  Namvar will be the first person to move to the hedge fund’s advisory board from its investment team.

629,NKE,"Puma upbeat for 2018, sees turnaround for soccer sales","HERZOGENAURACH, Germany (Reuters) - German sportswear brand Puma (PUMG.DE) said on Monday it expects to increase its operating profit by another third in 2018 and lift sales by 10 percent, predicting a recovery in soccer sales even after top team Italy failed to qualify for the World Cup. Puma, which still far lags German rival Adidas (ADSGn.DE) and market leader Nike (NKE.N), has revived its fortunes in recent years by spending heavily on sponsoring top soccer teams and partnering with celebrities like singer Rihanna. Puma saw its shares tumble last month after French parent Kering (PRTP.PA) said it would spin off the brand to its shareholders. Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden said on Monday he still expects Kering and France’s Pinault family, which controls Kering, to remain long-term shareholders. Despite the fact Italy, whose kit Puma provides, will not play at the World Cup, Gulden said he was confident that Puma’s soccer sales would recover in 2018 due to popular new shoes worn by top players, adding it hopes to sign another one or two World Cup teams. “We think 2018 will be a turnaround year for our soccer business,” Gulden told a news conference. Puma’s social media campaigns for 2018 will put a big focus on Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton and actress Selena Gomez, Gulden said, adding he is optimistic for collaborations to mark the 50th anniversary of its classic Suede sneaker, including with Japan’s popular Hello Kitty character. Puma, which already sponsors top teams such as Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund, announced a deal on Monday with Italy’s AC Milan, currently seventh in the Serie A league. The club had long partnered with Adidas. Puma last week agreed a partnership with Senegal’s soccer federation, bringing to three the number of World Cup teams it is sponsoring, along with Switzerland and Uruguay, well behind Adidas and Nike, which dominate the market for soccer gear. Puma reported quarterly earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) more than doubled to 30 million euros ($37.8 million) on sales that rose by a currency-adjusted 14.5 percent to 1.04 billion euros, broadly in line with average analyst forecasts. Puma’s shares were up 0.5 percent at 1053 GMT, underperforming a 1.8 percent firmer German small-cap index .SDAXI. Puma said it expects a 10 percent rise in sales in constant currencies and 2018 EBIT of between 305 million and 325 million, up from 245 million in 2017. Gulden said the spin-off from Kering would not affect Puma’s strategy but will give more details on March 20 at a capital markets day in London.

632,NKE,U.S. snowboarding golds spark jacket sales,"PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Sports e-commerce company Fanatics said that sales of a $300 Nike Inc Team USA jacket have spiked following United States’ Chloe Kim and Shaun White winning gold medals, making jackets its highest grossing Olympics category. While the Winter Games does not have the global scale of the Summer Games as it features fewer countries, sponsors and companies connected to the event can still see a boost from selling apparel and merchandise. Kim blew away the competition to win the women’s snowboard halfpipe gold on Tuesday. The following day White delivered a stunning routine on the final run of a gripping halfpipe final to win his third Winter Olympic gold and a landmark 100th for his country. Fanatics, which handles merchandising for the United States Olympic Committee, said it sold thousands of Team USA jackets since the Olympics started, but it picked up “insanely” after Kim and White competed. The spacesuit inspired $800 Burton jackets similar to uniforms that the U.S. snowboard team competed in are also out of stock for both men and women on the Burton website. “As soon as White’s performance happened on the half pipe, we saw the immediate demand come in for snowboarding,” Jack Boyle, co-president of Fanatics direct-to-consumer business, told Reuters. It is seeing an 80 percent boost in sales of Olympic gear compared to the last winter Games in Sochi in 2014, which it credits to carrying a bigger selection of official items approved by the USOC, ranging from a $45.99 cowbell to a Swatch watch that sells for $119.99. Hockey jersey sales are still the top selling sport category at the Olympics, which Fanatics expects to remain strong throughout the games.  “There could be very well be more interest with a return back to the amateurs in the Olympics,” Boyle said. At the beginning of the Games, curling reached the No. 2 selling Olympic sport behind hockey for a few days as shirts with the Team USA curling were in demand. Snowboarding has since replaced curling in the No. 2 spot behind hockey. One surprise best-seller has been a $90 Team USA one piece pyjama. The company had to re-order a batch of pyjamas four times after it was featured on The Today Show morning show on NBC, Boyle said. Fanatics is only allowed to sell Olympics merchandise related to the United States but it said the Games was leading to increased sales from non-Olympic branded gear from Canada, Russia and Nordic countries.

634,NKE,"Hedge funds wager on rising wages and inflation with consumer, materials shares","NEW YORK (Reuters) - In late 2017, several well-known hedge funds made bets on companies selling goods considered non-essential by consumers and on companies processing raw materials, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange commission published on Wednesday. Companies in the “consumer discretionary” sector can take advantage of rising wages and prices, meaning the hedge funds may be well placed even as inflation fears have sent U.S. stocks into retreat for much of the past two weeks. Tiger Management, run by billionaire investor Julian Robertson Jr., made broad bets on consumer discretionary stocks, with new positions in Papa John’s International Inc, Penske Automotive Group Inc, and Domino’s Pizza Inc.  Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn added 13 new positions in consumer discretionary companies, including stakes in amusement park company SeaWorld Entertainment Inc, photo printing service Shutterly Inc and department store Nordstrom Inc.  Pershing Square’s William Ackman made a new bet on sportswear maker Nike Inc, buying 5.8 million shares, late last year. He also increased his bet on snackfood maker Mondelez by 66 percent to own 23.3 million shares. And George Soros’ eponymous Soros Fund Management LLC took new stakes in retailers Overstock.com Inc and Target Corp as well as Netflix Inc, filings showed, becoming the third largest Overstock shareholder. U.S. wages in January logged their biggest annual increase since the end of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, meaning consumers may have more to spend, even though Labor Department figures on Wednesday showed consumer prices rose more than expected last month. In the past two weeks concerns that rising inflation will push the Federal Reserve to accelerate its forecast interest rate rises this year have erased the S&P; 500 stock index’s gains for the year, after a 5.6 per cent rise in January, the strongest performance for that month since 1997.   The quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers’ stock holdings, in the so-called 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision, are one of the few public ways of tracking what managers buy and sell.  Relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy carries some risk because the disclosures come 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions. Farallon Capital Management LLC, a $25.4 billion San Francisco-based fund founded by Tom Steyer, added new positions in materials companies Monsanto Co and Tronox Ltd, according to regulatory filings released on Tuesday. Third Point, run by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, also added a position in Monsanto in the quarter ended Dec. 31, according to filings. Shares of the agricultural company are up nearly 3.0 percent for the year to date, about two percentage points more than the benchmark S&P; 500 stock index. Overall, hedge funds have their highest exposure to commodities since 2012, according to a report by Credit Suisse.  Hedge funds posted an estimated 4.1 percent gain in January, the Credit Suisse report said, with the largest gains coming in positions in consumer discretionary and healthcare stocks.  “January’s record performance provided a buffer to February’s vol-inspired risk-off move,” said Mark Connors, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said in the note. “Managers appear to be weathering the storm well.”  The 13F filings also showed that managers expected healthcare stocks to trade higher during the last three months of 2017. A number added fresh positions before the sector came under pressure from the recent stock market volatility and from the move by Amazon.com Inc to team with Berkshire Hathaway Inc <BRKa.N > and JPMorgan Chase & Co to reduce employee healthcare costs.

The Jordan brand now generates $3.1 billion of annual revenue for Nike, which is based in Beaverton, Oregon. Rentmeester’s photo depicted Jordan, then a student at the University of North Carolina, airborne in a grassy knoll featuring a basketball hoop as a prop, with his left arm extended upward and a basketball in hand. Several months later, Nike commissioned a similarly posed photo but used Chicago’s skyline as background, because Jordan was then playing for the National Basketball Association’s Chicago Bulls. Nike used that photo to market Air Jordan sneakers, and in 1987 to create the Jumpman logo. Circuit Judge Paul Watford wrote that while both photos “capture Michael Jordan in a leaping pose inspired by ballet’s grand jeté,” they were not “substantially similar” because of differences in setting, lighting and other elements. Watford said this meant the logo was also acceptable, and added that Jordan’s pose by itself could not be copyrighted. “Copyright promotes the progress of science and the useful arts by encouraging others to build freely upon the ideas and information conveyed by a work,” Watford wrote. “That is all Nike’s photographer did here.” A lawyer for Rentmeester did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nike had no immediate comment. Rentmeester, a former Olympic rower from the Netherlands, had sued in January 2015 for copyright infringement damages for the prior three years, avoiding issues with his 30-year delay. Circuit Judge John Owens dissented from Tuesday’s decision, calling dismissal of the copyright claim premature. “Whether the Nike photo is substantially similar is not an uncontested breakaway layup,” he wrote. The decision upheld a June 2015 ruling by now-Chief Judge Michael Mosman of the federal district court in Portland, Oregon. Jordan, 55, is principal owner of the NBA’s Charlotte Hornets. The Hall of Famer is worth $1.65 billion according to Forbes magazine. The case is Rentmeester v Nike Inc, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-35509.

638,NKE,UPDATE 3-Kohl's shares slide on rising expense concerns,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N) shares fell more than 6 percent on Thursday after the retailer forecast first-quarter earnings below Wall Street’s expectations, partly due to higher costs, taking the shine off strong sales for the holiday shopping period.  Earnings per share will be between 45 cents and 50 cents per share for the first quarter, Chief Financial Officer Bruce Besanko said on a call to discuss the company’s latest quarterly results, affected by higher spending on migration of its data to the cloud and investments in stores and getting items to online buyers.  Analysts on average had expected earnings per share of 55 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The company said sales, general and administrative expenses would rise in the mid-single digits for the quarter. Analysts had estimated a rise of 2.65 percent. Kohl’s is working to lure back department store customers that have defected to online, fast-fashion and off-price sellers and pull out of an industry-wide slump. While it has joined rivals in closing some locations and shrunk the size of many more, it has also been spending on technology and in-store investments to blend its online and brick-and-mortar businesses. For the fourth quarter ended Jan. 27, its same-store sales jumped 6.3 percent, slightly topping analyst expectations. But it forecast comparable sales growth in 2018 of flat to up 2 percent, indicating its growth rate may slow after 1.5 percent growth in 2017.  Kohl’s had outpaced rivals in a generally strong U.S. holiday shopping season, crediting Nike and Under Armour sales, digital growth and a focus on rolling out exclusive items more quickly.  Revenue rose 9 percent to $6.78 billion in the quarter, slightly beating analyst estimates. The retailer also said on Thursday supermarket chain Aldi will lease space from some of its locations in a pilot aimed at increasing store traffic. The test will take place in 10 to 15 stores, Kohl’s Chief Executive Kevin Mansell said on the conference call. The retailer previously said it was looking at partnerships for unused space in its “right-sized” stores.  Kohl’s has also partnered with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) to sell electronics and accept the online seller’s returns in certain stores. Executives said on the call did not discuss any potential expansion of the program. Kohl’s expects fiscal 2018 earnings per share of $4.95 to $5.45. Analysts estimate full-year earnings of about $4.72 a share.  The company said gross margin should increase 5 to 10 basis for the year compared to 2017, but that it will be at the low end of that range in the first quarter.  Earnings per share in the fourth quarter rose to $1.99, excluding the impact of a U.S. tax overhaul and store closures. Excluding a state tax settlement EPS was $1.87.  On that basis, analysts had forecast earnings of $1.77 per share. ",3012018,http://www.reuters.com/article/kohls-results/update-3-kohls-shares-slide-on-rising-expense-concerns-idUSL2N1QJ0KO
639,NKE,Burberry turns to ex-Givenchy star Tisci as Bailey checks out,"PARIS (Reuters) - Burberry (BRBY.L) turned to Riccardo Tisci as its new designer on Thursday, with the former Givenchy star’s appointment greeted by a share price jump as the British fashion house moves upmarket.  Tisci, a celebrity favorite who has designed stage costumes for singers Beyonce and Madonna, replaces Burberry’s creative chief Christopher Bailey, who turned the trench coat maker into a global brand by making its classic camel, red and black check designs must-haves around the world. Burberry shares jumped as much as 7.1 percent, and were up 4.7 percent at 1254 GMT as investors welcomed a well-known industry figure who might help jumpstart sluggish sales. Tisci has also collaborated with Nike, another potential plus at a time when luxury streetwear such as sneakers is proving a hit. Luxury goods companies are riding a rebound in Chinese demand and younger shoppers flocking to high-end brands, although Burberry has stuttered of late. Tisci, a 43-year-old graduate of Central Saint Martins in London, is credited with revitalizing LVMH-owned Givenchy (LVMH.PA) with an edgy, gothic style over his 2005-2017 tenure. “We believe that the contemporary, street style orientation of Riccardo Tisci is a great match to relaunch the image of Burberry,” Berstein analyst Mario Ortelli said in a note.  Burberry chief executive Marco Gobbetti - who had overlapped with fellow Italian Tisci at Givenchy - is looking to breathe new life into the 162-year-old brand.    “Riccardo’s creative vision will reinforce the ambitions we have for Burberry,” Gobbetti said.  Burberry’s turnaround plan echoes strategies pursued by many French or Italian peers, with a focus on high-margin items such as handbags, boutique revamps and a shift away from selling through lower-end department stores. Some rivals like Gucci, owned by French conglomerate Kering (PRTP.PA), have also benefited from a radical design overhaul.   Gucci’s reinvention with a flamboyant look, under a new CEO-designer pairing in the past three years, helped sales soar.  Gobbetti, who joined Burberry in 2017, has cautioned that the shift could take several years.   The fashion world is also notoriously fickle, and Tisci will have to convince with his new take on Burberry’s style when he presents his first collection in September.      Bailey’s attempt to combine his designer job with that of CEO between 2014 and 2017 - an unusual dual role in fashion - fell flat and he relinquished his CEO position in July. He will stay on as an adviser until the end of the year after presenting his last Burberry collection, a colorful run through the label’s archives, last month.

648,NKE,Puma takes up basketball again as it sets new targets,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German sportswear brand Puma (PUMG.DE) plans to rejoin the basketball market as it makes a push to grow in the United States and China and bring its profitability closer to that of larger rivals Adidas (ADSGn.DE) and Nike (NKE.N). Puma, which has put a big focus on soccer and running in recent years and makes the bulk of its sales in Europe, has hinted for some time that it was considering returning to major American sports after pulling out of basketball 17 years ago. Puma said it will partner with athletes and celebrities linked to basketball, noting that basketball shoes still dominate U.S. footwear sales although Nike and Under Armour (UAA.N) have been hit by a shift away from basketball performance shoes to more retro styles in the last few years. Nike has the contract to supply NBA uniforms. Puma made the announcement as it issued new medium-term targets at a capital markets day. Puma said it sees “substantial upside” for the brand in the U.S. market, while it expects Greater China - where basketball is also popular - to be its top market by 2022, according to slides prepared for the presentation to investors. Puma shares jumped 5.5 percent by 1136 GMT, the second biggest German small-cap gainer .SDAX. The stock had dipped after French parent Kering (PRTP.PA) said in January it would spin off the brand, before rallying on an upbeat 2018 outlook. Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden has revived Puma’s fortunes over the past five years by sponsoring top soccer teams and partnering with celebrities including singer Rihanna. However,   its profitability lags well behind bigger local rival Adidas and market leader Nike. A focus on the U.S. and Chinese markets should help it boost profits as currently lacks scale in the former, while profit margins are the highest in the sporting goods industry in China. Puma said on Tuesday it wants to lift its operating profit margin to about 10 percent of sales by 2022 at the latest, up from the 5.6 percent it reported in 2017, and versus 9.8 percent at Adidas and the 13.8 percent Nike saw in fiscal 2016/17. Shares in Adidas jumped last week after it raised its operating margin target to 11.5 percent for 2020.  Puma expects currency-adjusted consolidated net sales to grow around 10 percent on average per year until 2022 and said it will propose a dividend of between 25 and 35 percent of consolidated net earnings starting in 2019. It wants sales from its own stores and ecommerce to account for 30 percent of sales in the medium-term, up from 23 percent now, a shift away from wholesale that should also support margins by cutting out the middleman of other retailers.

The company said it expected revenue in North America to be flat in the fourth quarter and return to growth in the first half of fiscal 2019. Shares of the Dow component rose about 3 percent in extended trading. They had closed down 3 percent at $64.42 in regular trading on reports that William Ackman’s Pershing Square had exited the company with a profit of about $100 million. “As we close Q3, we now see a significant reversal of trend in North America,” CEO Mark Parker said in a statement. North America has been a weak spot for Nike as the company battled tough competition from a resurgent Adidas (ADSGn.DE) and as the bankruptcies of sporting goods retailers Sports Authority and Sports Chalet weighed on its supply chain. Revenue in the region has declined for three straight quarters, including a 6 percent drop in the latest quarter.  In response, Nike has pivoted toward selling directly to customers and has partnered with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).  Nike is also banking on its strength in innovation. With more innovation in the Nike Air range, Parker said on a post-earnings call that he expected to grow the business by “several billion dollars over the next few years.”  “The greater scale of these platforms will create greater impact on our business into Q4 and beyond.” The company’s international business continued to perform well, with all three regions reporting growth in the third quarter. China sales jumped 24.3 percent and the company plans to maintain the momentum through the launch of NikePlus membership in the Asian country in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

651,NKE,Ackman exits Nike stake with $100 million in profit: source,"(Reuters) - Investor William Ackman has stepped out of his Nike (NKE.N) sneakers, at least in a financial sense. The billionaire investor’s hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management earned roughly $100 million in profit when it cashed out of its 0.71 percent stake in the sportswear company recently, a person familiar with the move said on Thursday. Two months ago, the activist investor told clients that Pershing Square had taken a rare passive stake in Nike at the end of 2017, when the stock was trading at around $53 a share and that the bet had already earned them a roughly 30 percent gain. Ackman, a passionate tennis player, is often photographed on courts wearing Nike apparel ranging from shoes to shirts to wrist bands. The Wall Street Journal first reported the hedge fund’s exit from the Dow component. The quick gains on Nike will be welcome news for Ackman’s investors who have watched him post losses for three consecutive years when long-held investments on Valeant (VRX.TO) and against Herbalife (HLF.N) weighed on returns. He exited Valeant last year and got out of Herbalife earlier this year. In January, Ackman told his investors that he was making changes to return the prominent firm to its glory days by shrinking his team, becoming more involved in the investment process again and leaving the marketing to someone else.. The firm generated compound returns of 21 per cent a year net of fees over 11 years from its launch to the end of 2014. Then it lost money in 2015, 2016, and 2017. So far, he has largely stuck to his plans to keep a lower profile. There was no big announcement that he had exited Herbalife and there was not much fanfare around the Nike investment either. Still, Ackman’s private hedge funds are again in the red for 2018, nursing losses of roughly 3.7 percent as the broader stock market, as measured by the S&P; 500, is roughly flat for the year. Pershing Square, which traditionally makes investments where it seeks to make changes in the board room, has left Nike at roughly the same time the company is grappling with issues surrounding its culture. There have been complaints about workplace behavior and Trevor Edwards, an executive who had been seen as a possible successor to the CEO, is leaving. Nike is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings after markets close on Thursday.

654,NKE,UPDATE 1-Ackman exits Nike stake with $100 mln in profit - source,"(Reuters) - Investor William Ackman has stepped out of his Nike (NKE.N) sneakers, at least in a financial sense. The billionaire investor’s hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management earned roughly $100 million in profit when it cashed out of its 0.71 percent stake in the sportswear company recently, a person familiar with the move said on Thursday. Two months ago, the activist investor told clients that Pershing Square had taken a rare passive stake in Nike at the end of 2017, when the stock was trading at around $53 a share and that the bet had already earned them a roughly 30 percent gain. Ackman, a passionate tennis player, is often photographed on courts wearing Nike apparel ranging from shoes to shirts to wrist bands. The Wall Street Journal first reported the hedge fund’s exit from the Dow component. The quick gains on Nike will be welcome news for Ackman’s investors who have watched him post losses for three consecutive years when long-held investments on Valeant (VRX.TO) and against Herbalife (HLF.N) weighed on returns. He exited Valeant last year and got out of Herbalife earlier this year. In January, Ackman told his investors that he was making changes to return the prominent firm to its glory days by shrinking his team, becoming more involved in the investment process again and leaving the marketing to someone else.. The firm generated compound returns of 21 per cent a year net of fees over 11 years from its launch to the end of 2014. Then it lost money in 2015, 2016, and 2017. So far, he has largely stuck to his plans to keep a lower profile. There was no big announcement that he had exited Herbalife and there was not much fanfare around the Nike investment either. Still, Ackman’s private hedge funds are again in the red for 2018, nursing losses of roughly 3.7 percent as the broader stock market, as measured by the S&P; 500, is roughly flat for the year. Pershing Square, which traditionally makes investments where it seeks to make changes in the board room, has left Nike at roughly the same time the company is grappling with issues surrounding its culture. There have been complaints about workplace behavior and Trevor Edwards, an executive who had been seen as a possible successor to the CEO, is leaving. Nike is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings after markets close on Thursday.

Adidas agreed in 2016 to expand its partnership with West, including opening new stores, after it poached the singer-turned-designer from Nike (NKE.N) in 2013, helping the German brand recover in the U.S. market in recent years. However, Adidas faced a call this week from the Care2 petition site to drop the artist after an interview in which he seemed to suggest that 400 years of slavery had been a choice, and also praised Trump for doing the “impossible”. “It is clear there are some remarks that we don’t support,” Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted told a conference call for journalists, but added: “We are very committed to the Yeezy brand moving forward.” Rorsted said the partnership was very important for the brand, although it had minimal impact on sales as most Yeezy products are released in limited quantities to generate hype. Rorsted made the comments after Adidas reported better-than-expected first-quarter net profit, as it outperformed rivals Nike and Under Armour (UAA.N) in North America. Adidas shares, up 13 percent in the last three months after it announced a big share buyback in March, were down 1 percent at 0857 GMT, with traders expressing concern about the West partnership and slower growth in Europe. Sales rose 21 percent in North America, and 26 percent in greater China, but only 5 percent in western Europe and fell 16 percent in Russia, where Rorsted said he saw little prospect for a recovery while sanctions continue.  Nike reported a 6 percent drop in sales in North America in the quarter to Feb. 28, while Under Armour saw flat sales in the region in the first three months of the year. Adidas said ecommerce sales growth slowed to 27 percent, which Rorsted said was due to fewer product launches in the quarter. Net profit rose 17 percent to 542 million euros ($650 million), ahead analysts average forecast of 510 million euros as higher prices helped offset currency headwinds and an increase in marketing spending. Rorsted also highlighted gross margin improvements at struggling fitness brand Reebok, which saw sales return to growth in North America for the first time in years. Unlike German rival Puma (PUMG.DE), Rorsted said he was not too concerned about the prospect of U.S. tariffs on footwear made in China, noting Adidas sources most of its shoes from Vietnam, with Chinese factories mainly producing for the domestic market.
