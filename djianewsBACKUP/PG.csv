1,PG,Ex-Goldman director Gupta may pursue SEC lawsuit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc director Rajat Gupta may pursue his lawsuit accusing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of violating his rights by denying him a jury trial in an insider-trading case.  U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff rejected the SEC motion to dismiss Gupta’s case, which stemmed from the agency beginning administrative proceedings against him on March 1.  Gupta, a former chief of consulting firm McKinsey & Co, was accused by the SEC of passing tips to Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam about Goldman and Procter & Gamble Co, where Gupta was once also a director.  The tips included alleged details about financial results, and a $5 billion investment in Goldman from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc at the height of the 2008 financial crisis.  On May 11, a federal jury convicted Rajaratnam of 14 securities fraud and conspiracy charges related to insider trading. Prosecutors named Gupta as an unindicted co-conspirator, but have not charged him criminally.  In his ruling, Rakoff said Gupta may argue that the SEC violated his equal protection rights by singling him out from other defendants it had sued in the Galleon case.  Some protections in federal court, including rights to have a jury trial, obtain some evidence and raise counterclaims, are not available in administrative proceedings.  “We have the unusual case where there is already a well developed public record of Gupta being treated substantially disparately from 28 essentially identical defendants, with not even a hint from the SEC, even in their instant papers, as to why this should be so,” Rakoff wrote.  The allegations of unequal treatment, if made properly, “would state a claim even if Gupta were entirely guilty of the charges made against him,” Rakoff added.  Gary Naftalis, a lawyer for Gupta, declined to comment on Rakoff’s decision. He has previously called the SEC charges “baseless.”  SEC spokesman John Nester declined to comment.  In his March 18 complaint, Gupta alleged that the SEC chose to bring administrative proceedings, authorized under last year’s Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, “for the bad faith purpose of shoring up a meritless case by disarming its adversary.”  Rakoff said it is unnecessary to decide whether Dodd-Frank should be applied retroactively to Gupta, and that the issue could very likely become moot.  The judge ordered expedited treatment of Gupta’s lawsuit, with a hearing on evidence within four months.  Last month, a U.S. administrative law judge delayed Gupta’s administrative proceedings, once scheduled for July 18, for six months after federal prosecutors filed motions to intervene.  At Rajaratnam’s trial, prosecutors played secretly recorded phone calls to show Gupta’s alleged tips.  In one, Rajaratnam and Gupta discussed a Goldman board meeting. In another, Rajaratnam told a Galleon colleague that a Goldman director provided him with details that the bank was on track for a surprise loss in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Rajaratnam is expected to be sentenced in the criminal case on September 27. He also faces SEC civil charges.  The case is Gupta v.

3,PG,Lonza to buy Arch Chemicals in deal worth $1.2 billion,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Drugs industry supplier Lonza LONN.VX is buying U.S.-based Arch Chemicals ARJ.N for some $1.2 billion, making it the world’s largest player in the multi-billion dollar microbial control market, the groups said.  The move, which boosts Lonza’s life science unit and also helps protect the Swiss group against the impact of the strong Swiss franc, puts Lonza in pole position in an area that plays a key role in the fight against disease-causing bacteria.  Microbial control involves destroying microorganisms, which carry disease. This is particularly important in hospitals as hospital-acquired infections are one of the leading causes of death of patients, as well as for ensuring food products are safe.  The rather fragmented microbial control market, currently valued at around $10 billion, is growing at some 4 to 6 percent per year, while demand for products to help prevent hospital-acquired infections or germs spreading in swimming pools is growing at a stronger pace.  Lonza will pay $47.20 per share for Arch Chemicals in cash, a premium of 36.7 percent to the U.S. group’s average closing price over the last 30 trading days, and the bid has the unanimous backing of Arch Chemical’s board.  At 0948 GMT, shares in Lonza were trading near flat, paring earlier losses and outperforming the 0.8 percent drop in the Swiss blue-chip market .SSMI despite some worries the price was high and it could be dilutive to Lonza's business model.  Based on the offer price for all the outstanding shares, Arch Chemicals’ enterprise value would be around $1.4 billion. Arch Chemicals had sales of around $1.4 billion in 2010, the groups said on Monday.  Together the two companies would have had sales of 4.1 billion Swiss francs ($4.89 billion) in 2010, with $1.6 billion in the life science market.  Lonza, which will finance the deal through debt, is expecting to complete the buy before the end of 2011.  “We are paying a 9.1 multiple on the last 12 months’ EBITDA (earnings before interest tax, depreciation and assets), in line with the sector multiples. This is also pre-synergy. After synergies, the multiple is 7.2 times EBITDA,” Lonza chief executive Stefan Borgas told Reuters.  Lonza is eyeing cost synergies of at least $50 million per year by the second year and the deal is expected to be earnings per share accretive in the first year, the groups said.  The Basel-based group will make job cuts in administration and corporate functions, Borgas said, but he added it is still too early to say how many staff will be affected.  “In our view, the combination clearly makes sense on the financial level and helps Lonza to respond to the pressures in its microbial control business, which had suffered in recent years from a shrinking market for wood protection products used in the construction industry,” Sarasin analyst David Kaegi said.  “On the downside, the deal also dilutes Lonza’s biotech investment case, which was so far regarded as the core of Lonza and which has seen gradual improvements over the last few quarters,” Kaegi said.  The deal will boost Lonza’s business in the fastest-growing markets of China and India, as well as Brazil and South Africa, where the group is not present at all, Borgas said.  Key customers also include players like Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and Unilever (ULVR.L), who need to make sure products like shampoos and creams are free of any harmful microbes.  There is growing demand for more information about the safety of products and their effects on health and the environment as well as for more effective ways to prevent the spread of infectious diseases like bird flu, swine flu and SARS.  Population growth and movement, urbanization, more travel and transportation of goods is also boosting demand for microbial control.  Borgas said on a conference call the group was unlikely to go for any larger acquisitions for the next two years, but he said the group was still on the prowl for bolt-on buys.

7,PG,"Icahn bids for Clorox, suggests others step up","CHICAGO/BANGALORE (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn put Clorox Co in play on Friday with a bid that values the company at more than $10 billion and suggested rivals consider paying much more for the bleach maker.  Icahn’s offer of $76.50 per share represents a 12 percent premium to the stock’s Thursday closing price and a 15.5 percent premium to its price in February, before Icahn announced his stake in the company.  In a letter to Clorox Chief Executive Donald Knauss, Icahn said he was confident the company could get “numerous superior bids” from large consumer products companies.  Investors were not heavily swayed. Clorox shares rose 8.1 percent to $73.90, more than $2.50 below the offer price.  “You could argue that people wouldn’t buy it, but I don’t see why not,” Icahn told Reuters.  Icahn, Clorox’s largest shareholder with a 9.4 percent stake, is known for pushing up the stocks in which he invests. In his letter, he said synergies resulting from any deal with a third-party strategic buyer could make even a $100-per-share offer viable to the likes of Procter & Gamble Co, Unilever Plc, Colgate-Palmolive Co, Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc, Kimberly-Clark Corp, Henkel AG and privately-held SC Johnson.  “They’ve got these great brands and that’s why it’s such a jewel for one of these companies,” Icahn told Reuters, ticking off products such as Clorox, Brita water filters and one of the products he has used personally, Kingsford charcoal.  Industry analysts were quick to shoot down such ideas, saying Clorox’s product lineup, which also includes Burt’s Bees lotions and Hidden Valley salad dressing, is not the best fit for companies that already make household and personal goods and have largely stayed away from food and Clorox’s more commoditized categories such as cat litter and charcoal.  “While many if not all can (financially) fund such a deal, why would they?” asked Weeden & Co analyst Javier Escalante. “What would a company like P&G do owning tiny Hidden Valley sauces or a Colgate owning Kingsford charcoal?”  Icahn’s offer of $76.50 per share values Clorox at $10.2 billion based on roughly 133.3 million shares outstanding as of March 31. Excluding the 12.5 million shares Icahn already owns, he would pay about $9.24 billion for the rest of Clorox’s shares and would also assume $2.125 billion in long-term debt.  The offer undervalues Clorox at just 9.5 times trailing 12-month EBITDA, said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. In 2010, Unilever offered about 14.8 times EBITDA for Alberto Culver.  Financial buyers are the more likely acquirers, she said. Strategic buyers are unlikely to be interested given the high level of private label penetration in several of Clorox’s categories and its exposure to more mature markets, she added.  Icahn first announced a 9.08 stake in Clorox in February and described the stock as undervalued.  Asked if Icahn’s proposal constituted a real bid, a Clorox spokesman said: “That’s really a question for Mr. Icahn. We don’t know what his plans are beyond what has been published.  “Our board is going to be reviewing the proposal.”  If no other potential buyers step up to buy Clorox, “there’s no question that we would do it,” Icahn said.  Icahn has a “highly confident letter” from Jefferies & Co to provide financing, along with $3.8 billion in cash.  “While we stand ready and able to buy Clorox, we encourage you to hold an open and friendly ‘go-shop’ sale process where all the synergistic buyers are offered due diligence and invited to bid,” Icahn said in the letter dated July 14.  The activist investor, who said he has already arranged for $7.8 billion in financing through Jefferies & Co, offered to pay a $100 million break-up fee if he is unable to close the transaction, provided Clorox agrees to the deal by July 29.  Clorox posted disappointing quarterly results in May and forecast weak earnings for the next fiscal year as it grapples with rising packaging and materials costs.  Options activity heated up in Clorox earlier this week.  A total of 16,000 calls traded on Clorox on Monday, 38 times the average daily call volume, while a total of 1,562 puts traded, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.  Icahn told Reuters he has never bought Clorox options.  “The options market feels confident some deal is going to happen and that there is a possibility for a rival bid,” said Mark Sebastian, chief operating officer of options education firm optionpit.com. “Call premiums are elevated on Friday.”  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which looks into unusual share and options activity, declined to comment.

9,PG,Clorox rejects Icahn bid as too low,"CHICAGO/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Clorox Co (CLX.N) on Monday rejected as too low an offer from billionaire investor Carl Icahn that values it at more than $10 billion.  The company, known for its bleach products, also adopted a poison pill to make an unwanted takeover more expensive.  “We’re certainly not opposed to a sale, just a steal,” said Clorox Chairman and Chief Executive Don Knauss, who told Reuters in a telephone interview that he had a “mutually respectful conversation” with Icahn earlier on Monday.  Knauss declined to say what an attractive price for the 99-year old company would be and he would not comment on whether other bidders had emerged.  The company, which also sells Burt’s Bees lotions and Hidden Valley salad dressings, would be open to any “credible, adequate” idea to increase shareholder value, Knauss said.  The poison pill provision adopted by Clorox would be triggered when a person or group acquired 10 percent or more of Clorox’s common stock in a transaction not approved by Clorox’s board of directors.  The poison pill would make it more costly for Icahn to push through a deal without the approval of Clorox’s board.  Clorox, based in Oakland, California, was not the only company defending itself against Icahn on Monday. Forest Laboratories Inc FRX.N said it planned to nominate at its shareholders meeting a 10-person board slate that included three new members, as the drugmaker fends off the investor.  A representative for Icahn, Clorox’s largest shareholder, was not available for comment.  “The prohibitively high cost to acquire (Clorox) under the shareholder rights plan makes it unlikely Mr. Icahn will move forward without the approval of the board,” BMO analyst Connie Maneaty wrote in a note to clients.  On Friday, Icahn put Clorox in play with an offer of $76.50 per share. That offer represented a 12 percent premium to the stock’s Thursday closing price and a 15.5 percent premium to its price in February, before Icahn announced his stake in the company.  Icahn also suggested that rival companies should consider paying even more for Clorox.  Icahn said in a letter that synergies resulting from any deal with a third-party strategic buyer could make even a $100 per share offer viable to the likes of Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) or Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N).  Clorox is more heavily exposed to the United States than larger consumer products makers and other competitors.  The U.S. consumer is “certainly in a fragile state,” but we are seeing some stabilization, said Knauss, who added that the  key for Clorox was to introduce new products.  The company is planning products to help prevent the spread of infections in homes, hospitals and acute care centers, and plans greater focus on environmentally friendly products.  The product pipeline “looks better now than in the five years I have been here,” said Knauss, Clorox’s CEO since October 2006.

11,PG,Consumer goods promotions skyrocketed in 2010: study,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Major makers of food and household products used coupons, in-store deals and other promotions to sell nearly one-fourth of their goods in North America last year as shoppers sharpened their focus on finding the best prices, a new study showed.  The volume of goods sold during promotions jumped by 80 percent in 2010, according to Terra Technology. That far exceeded the 1 percent growth in volume of all goods sold, the supply chain technology company said.  The use of promotions still was below typical levels, as manufacturers ramped up activity that they had reduced in efforts to conserve cash during the recession.  Manufacturers “have sort of felt like we walked away from the edge of the cliff” and are recapturing market share as they “sort of return more to business as normal,” Terra Chief Executive Officer Rob Byrne said.  The use of promotions soared in 2010, with the total volume of goods sold from promotions jumping to 23 percent from 13 percent, according to Terra's second annual forecasting study. (For a graphic, click r.reuters.com/mub72s)  Nine consumer products makers that use Terra’s software were included in the study: Campbell Soup Co (CPB.N), ConAgra Foods Inc (CAG.N), General Mills Inc (GIS.N), Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N), Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N, Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), privately held S.C. Johnson, J.M. Smucker Co (SJM.N) and Unilever NV/Plc (UNc.AS) (ULVR.L).  For consumer packaged goods companies, promotional sales typically account for 30 percent to 50 percent of volume, Byrne said, so the participants are still below the usual average.  So far, 2011 is “fairly similar to 2010,” although “innovation is picking up again,” Byrne said.  Of all sales, new items accounted for 13 percent in 2010, up from 9 percent in 2009. New goods accounted for 23 percent of nonfood consumer goods volume and 8 percent of food volume in 2010, Byrne said.  At the same time, many consumers have become savvier, using the Internet and mobile applications to find the best prices.  In 2010, the top 1 percent of items on promotion accounted for 30 percent of the promotional volume, according to Terra.

12,PG,Clorox rejects Icahn bid as too low,"CHICAGO/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Clorox Co (CLX.N) on Monday rejected as too low an offer from billionaire investor Carl Icahn that values it at more than $10 billion.  The company, known for its bleach products, also adopted a poison pill to make an unwanted takeover more expensive.  “We’re certainly not opposed to a sale, just a steal,” said Clorox Chairman and Chief Executive Don Knauss, who told Reuters in a telephone interview that he had a “mutually respectful conversation” with Icahn earlier on Monday.  Knauss declined to say what an attractive price for the 99-year old company would be and he would not comment on whether other bidders had emerged.  The company, which also sells Burt’s Bees lotions and Hidden Valley salad dressings, would be open to any “credible, adequate” idea to increase shareholder value, Knauss said.  The poison pill provision adopted by Clorox would be triggered when a person or group acquired 10 percent or more of Clorox’s common stock in a transaction not approved by Clorox’s board of directors.  The poison pill would make it more costly for Icahn to push through a deal without the approval of Clorox’s board.  Clorox, based in Oakland, California, was not the only company defending itself against Icahn on Monday. Forest Laboratories Inc FRX.N said it planned to nominate at its shareholders meeting a 10-person board slate that included three new members, as the drugmaker fends off the investor.  A representative for Icahn, Clorox’s largest shareholder, was not available for comment.  “The prohibitively high cost to acquire (Clorox) under the shareholder rights plan makes it unlikely Mr. Icahn will move forward without the approval of the board,” BMO analyst Connie Maneaty wrote in a note to clients.  On Friday, Icahn put Clorox in play with an offer of $76.50 per share. That offer represented a 12 percent premium to the stock’s Thursday closing price and a 15.5 percent premium to its price in February, before Icahn announced his stake in the company.  Icahn also suggested that rival companies should consider paying even more for Clorox.  Icahn said in a letter that synergies resulting from any deal with a third-party strategic buyer could make even a $100 per share offer viable to the likes of Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) or Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N).

15,PG,"Kimberly-Clark tops view, feels input cost pinch","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N) reported second-quarter earnings that beat estimates but said full-year profit could come in toward the low end of its forecast, as costs for oil-based materials keep rising for the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers.  Kimberly-Clark said on Monday that it expected to pay an extra $650 million to $750 million for materials such as polymer resin, superabsorbents, adhesives and other packaging materials this year.  Back in January, input costs were expected to rise only $200 million to $250 million and be fully offset by cost-cutting. Then in April, the company forecast $450 million to $550 million in additional costs. Kimberly-Clark said it expects to find more economies in areas such as supply chain and sourcing, and will keep raising some prices.  However, the company will hold off on raising North American prices on its Huggies diapers until later this year due to some packaging changes taking hold in the industry.  Shares of Kimberly-Clark, whose results kicked off earnings reports from major U.S. household products makers, fell 2 percent to $66.56 in afternoon trading.  Chief Executive Tom Falk said he is not interested in “big, transformational M&A,” after being asked about whether his company might want to bid for Clorox Co (CLX.N), which was put in play by investor Carl Icahn this month.  Icahn, whose current offer for Clorox stands at $80 per share, suggested others such as Kimberly should offer more.  “We would consider Clorox to be a well-managed company and so, as we look at it, it’s hard to see how you come in and do a whole lot better job of it,” Falk said on a conference call.  Kimberly-Clark’s Huggies diapers lost some market share in North America during the quarter. A lower birth rate, along with stepped-up competition from Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) and store brands, has put pressure on that business.  Kimberly-Clark had planned to raise Huggies prices in North America by 3 percent to 7 percent. [ID:nN17149585] It is now holding off, likely until October, as it moves larger packs from cardboard boxes into plastic bags after talks with retailers.  Getting rid of the cardboard should also lead to “slight cost savings,” Falk told Reuters.  P&G might have to delay its 7 percent price increase on Pampers to maintain competitive price gaps, said Wells Fargo analyst Tim Conder.  P&G would not comment on its plans. It announced a price increase back in April.  Kimberly-Clark’s profit fell to $408 million, or $1.03 per share, from $498 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, earnings per share were $1.18, coming in ahead of the analysts’ $1.14 forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Kimberly-Clark, which also makes Kotex feminine care products and Scott paper goods, said sales rose 8.3 percent to $5.26 billion, topping analysts’ forecast of $5.13 billion.  But five percentage points of the rise in sales came from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The volume of goods sold rose just 2 percent, and prices were up 1 percent.  Kimberly-Clark still expects to earn $4.80 per share to $5.05 per share this year, excluding special items. However, without some moderation in input costs, its profit is more likely to be in the lower half of that range, Falk said.  The company is heavily exposed to material costs, with products such as tissues and diapers making up a large chunk of its business. While commodity costs have also risen for rivals such as P&G, their portfolios are more diversified.  Kimberly-Clark plans to offset some of the higher costs by cutting more expenses. It now expects to save $300 million to $350 million this year, up $50 million from a prior target.  The company now expects sales to rise 5 percent to 7 percent, up from a prior forecast of 4 percent to 6 percent, aided by strengthening foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar.

18,PG,Walmart Express debuting in Chicago on Wednesday," * Wal-Mart’s first urban small store to open in Chicago   * Plans to open 15 Walmart Express stores this year   By Jessica Wohl   CHICAGO, July 26 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) is opening its first small store in Chicago on Wednesday as it tests a format it hopes will allow it to penetrate urban markets that have resisted its huge stores.   The Walmart Express in the Chatham neighborhood will be 10,000 square feet, about one-tenth the size of the company’s traditional stores.   Four more Walmart Express stores are planned for Chicago, along with three Walmart Market stores, which are more like traditional grocery stores, and two Walmart Supercenters.   Wal-Mart said last year that it should create about 10,000 jobs in Chicago through 2015 through new stores.   The Chicago stores and small stores in Arkansas and North Carolina are opening as Wal-Mart tries to reverse two years of declining sales at existing U.S. discount stores.   The chain is trying to win back customers who are shopping more at chains such as Family Dollar Stores Inc FDO.N that pack a variety of food and basic goods into small shops.   “I think it’s fair to say there’s a multibillion dollar growth opportunity in a lot of these cities, and Wal-Mart just hasn’t had the right format to penetrate,” said Natalie Berg, global research director at Planet Retail.   The Walmart Express format is being overseen by Anthony Hucker, vice president of strategy and business development. Before joining Wal-Mart, Hucker spent a decade at German deep discount chain Aldi, including setting up its UK stores.   Aldi stocks only its own branded goods, while Walmart Express has Wal-Mart’s Great Value brand and merchandise from companies like Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N and Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N).   Wal-Mart started testing the Walmart Express format in June in rural parts of Arkansas and North Carolina, and has said it is pleased with early results.   Setting up shop in cities like Chicago and New York costs more than in a rural area, as rents can be two to three times higher, Hucker said while walking through the new Chicago store on Tuesday.   There are also logistical issues like tighter spaces within stores and traffic that can hamper truck deliveries, he said.   “If they can’t get the store economics right then the format really doesn’t have a future,” said Berg. “There’s going to be a lot of pressure on keeping costs down.”   With more than 9,200 stores globally, Wal-Mart is likely to have an edge over urban competitors.   “They’re the largest retailer in the world, so from a pricing perspective they can compete with anyone,” said Steve Ferrara, a partner in the retail and consumer practice at BDO USA in Chicago.   The day before the grand opening, workers loaded produce, chips, beer and other goods onto shelves and displayed signs touting locally grown produce.   Wal-Mart is starting to buy more locally, cutting down on distribution costs while highlighting environmental efforts. The first items shoppers will see when they enter the store are cantaloupes from Illinois’ Frey Farms and mini watermelons.   The store already has some competition from a new Aldi nearby and other chains not far away, such as Walgreen Co WAG.N.   Wal-Mart has one Supercenter in Chicago, miles away in the Austin neighborhood. Its next Supercenter is due to open next spring, in the same shopping area as the new Walmart Express.

19,PG,UPDATE 3-Energizer's zapped profit tops expectations,"   * Q3 adjusted EPS $1.37 tops Wall St view $1.25   * Sales up 14.6 pct to $1.23 bln   * Still sees adjusted FY EPS $5.10-$5.30 excluding items   * Shares up 3.2 percent at $80.40 after hitting $81.32  (Adds analyst comments, stock buybacks, updates stock movement)   By Jessica Wohl   CHICAGO, July 27 (Reuters) - Energizer Holdings Inc’s (ENR.N) quarterly profit did not fall as much as expected, as strong razor sales helped mitigate the impact of higher costs for materials such as zinc and weak demand for batteries.   The maker of Energizer and Eveready batteries, Schick razors and Playtex tampons topped Wall Street’s profit forecast even though it spent more on advertising than some analysts had expected. Its shares, which the company is buying back, rose as much as 4.4 percent.   Energizer said it had repurchased 2.2 million shares so far this fiscal year, including 1.2 million in July alone.   “Buybacks have been a critical driver of the stock ... and they haven’t been really that aggressive for about four years,” said UBS analyst Nik Modi, who upgraded the shares to “buy” in early July.   Energizer said on Wednesday that earnings fell to $65.9 million, or 94 cents per share, in the third quarter ended on June 30 from $104 million, or $1.47 per share, a year earlier.   Excluding items such as restructuring costs, the per-share profit rose to $1.37 from $1.35 and surpassed Wall Street’s average forecast of $1.25, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Energizer, which raised prices to help offset higher costs, said sales jumped 14.6 percent to $1.23 billion, buoyed by November’s American Safety razor acquisition and favorable currency fluctuations.   The company has suffered from the increasing use of devices with built-in rechargeable battery systems, as well as volatile commodity markets and competition from companies such as larger rival Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N).   Besides their dueling battery businesses, Energizer and Duracell maker P&G also compete in razors and tampons.   At Tuesday’s close, shares of Energizer were up 6.9 percent so far this year, while P&G had fallen 1.9 percent.   On Wednesday morning, Energizer shares were up 3.2 percent at $80.40 after rising as high as $81.32. P&G fell 0.4 percent to $62.84.   Energizer’s sales of personal care items such as razors and sunscreen rose 23.1 percent to $725.3 million, helped by the American Safety deal. Organic sales, which strip out currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, rose 4.9 percent.   Sales of household products, including batteries, rose 4.4 percent to $509.2 million, and organic sales fell 0.2 percent.   Operational profitability rose about 14 percent in personal care and fell about 24 percent in household products.   The company spent $156.2 million, or 12.7 percent of net sales, on advertising and promotions, compared with $145.2 million, or 13.5 percent, a year earlier.   Energizer still expects 2011 earnings, excluding one-time items, of $5.10 to $5.30 a share, matching the bleak forecast it gave back in February. Analysts are now looking for a profit of $5.28.   However, the company said it now expects net earnings of $3.90 to $4.10 per share, down from its April forecast of $4.00 to $4.20, due to payments associated with debt refinancing.

The price increase was one of several announced on Wednesday, even as Clorox said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit fell less than expected and that costs in the current fiscal year will rise less than it previously thought.   Shares of the company, which last month rebuffed two takeover offers from Carl Icahn, fell 1.4 percent.   Clorox, which makes cleansers, charcoal, salad dressing and other goods, is more heavily exposed to volatile commodity prices than some larger peers such as Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N). The commodities Clorox buys include resin, diesel, chlor-alkali and sodium hypochlorite.   Besides the bleach price hike, the seven new U.S. price increases include mid-to-high single-digit percentage increases on Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing, Formula 409 and Clorox cleaners, Clorox 2 stain fighter and Glad wraps.   (Click here for a graphic of some pricing actions Clorox has taken: r.reuters.com/nyk92s )   “Those pricing increases look pretty aggressive, but I’m sure they’ve thought this through,” said Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo. “They realize there’s going to be some volume hit from this.”   Clorox anticipates volume falling in the first half of fiscal 2012, that ends December, as it raises prices. Gross margin is expected to decline 1.5 to 1.75 percentage points in the first quarter.   In late July, Clorox called the latest bid from Icahn, its largest shareholder, inadequate. The bid of $80 per share valued Clorox at $10.66 billion. [ID:nN1E76P1Z2]   Chairman and Chief Executive Don Knauss told analysts on a conference call that he would not answer questions about Icahn’s proposal or Clorox’s board’s response.   Clorox shares on Wednesday afternoon were down 1.4 percent at $69.27, more than $10 below Icahn’s July 20 offer and slightly above the stock’s closing price of $68.43 back on July 14, the day before Icahn made his first bid of $76.50 public.   The shares have not yet hit even the first offer price, suggesting investors do not anticipate a deal will actually happen.   “The stock is going to sit in here and kind of drift aimlessly until we get some resolution of this matter with Mr. Icahn,” said Russo at Edward Jones.   Clorox earned $169 million, or $1.26 per share, in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended in June, down from $171 million, or $1.20 per share, on more shares outstanding a year earlier.   Analysts, on average, expected it to earn $1.19 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Sales rose 3.7 percent to $1.48 billion.   Volume grew in the company’s cleaning, household and lifestyle categories, but was flat in the international unit.   Gross margin declined to 43.5 percent from 44.3 percent a year earlier, due largely to higher commodity costs.   Clorox still expects to earn $4.00 to $4.10 per share this year, including plans to spend about 18 to 20 cents per share on technology and facilities.   Analysts are looking for it to earn $4.06 per share.   The company expects sales to rise 1 percent to 3 percent in fiscal 2012 after falling $3 million last year.   It now expects $140 million to $150 million in higher commodity costs this fiscal year, down from its prior forecast of $160 million to $170 million.

25,PG,US business urges big changes in WTO trade talks," * Doha round said “incapable” of reaching good conclusion   * Manufacturers urge new “business model” for WTO talks   By Doug Palmer   WASHINGTON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - With U.S. economic growth nearly stalled and unemployment stuck above 9 percent, Caterpillar’s (CAT.N) man in Washington, Bill Lane, has been pitching what many think is a crazy idea: one more try to reach a big market-opening deal through the World Trade Organization.   Facing a panel last week of top trade lobbyists for the U.S. manufacturing, services and farm sectors, Lane warned that countries in Asia, Latin America and Europe were striking new trade deals at much faster pace than the United States.   “We’re being disadvantaged not because of protectionism but because they’re embracing trade liberalization in a much more aggressive form than the U.S. The only way we can leapfrog what’s going on ... is to do something bold and do something bold through the WTO (World Trade Organization),” Lane said.   It was a rousing call for resuscitating the all-but dead Doha round of global trade talks, which the United States helped launch in the capital of Qatar just two months after the September 11, 2001 attacks.   But these days it is hard to get cheers in Washington for the epic-length talks. Lane’s friends and colleagues, as much as they would welcome a global deal to open new markets to U.S. exports, essentially told him there was no hope.   “The WTO, for services, holds no promise,” said Bob Vastine, president of the Coalition of Service Industries. “It’s a vehicle incapable of delivering the goods.”   “The premise that a breakthrough idea is possible in Geneva is not borne out by the facts,” said Scott Miller, director of global trade policy for consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG.N). “It’s hard to find ambition in Geneva.”   In four months, the 153 members of the WTO will gather in Geneva to try chart a new path for the Doha negotiations.   Caterpillar has benefited mightily from trade reforms and the construction equipment giant has been at the forefront of efforts to push long-stalled U.S. free trade deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama through the U.S. Congress.   But many U.S. business groups have soured on the Doha round, seeing it now as more of an obstacle to trade liberalization than an opportunity for export growth.   They complain the never-ending talks have kept the WTO from moving on to other more promising projects.   “Nobody wanted a deal to slash trade barriers more” than the National Association of Manufacturers, said Frank Vargo, the group’s vice president for international economic affairs.   “(But) the Doha round has failed miserably in generating new market access that we want for ourselves and other countries,” he said.   Last month, World Bank President Robert Zoellick, a former chief U.S. trade negotiator, criticized the United States for not showing more leadership in the talks.   But Vargo and other panel members at the discussion put the blame on major emerging countries such as China, Brazil and India for refusing to offer deep enough tariff cuts to create new export opportunities for the United States.   Those concessions are needed to persuade Congress to cut U.S. farm subsidies and remaining high U.S. tariffs in areas such as textiles and trucks, the businessmen said.   In the services negotiations, “the offers on the table (from major developing countries) offer virtually no new commercial advantage,” Vastine said.   “Why are we wasting our time? Let’s find other venues,” Vastine said, such as the proposed TransPacific Partnership between the United States and eight other countries.   Others said putting the WTO back on track as a venue to negotiate new market openings required changes in the conduct of the  multilateral trade talks.   “The Doha round is committed to a strategy that may not work any more,” Miller said, arguing the WTO should shift from its focus on a wide-ranging deal involving all 153 members to smaller agreements with fewer countries.   Vargo agreed, saying the Doha round’s governing principle that nothing is resolved until everything is resolved has in effect prevented any agreement.   WTO members should also “look at moving away from universal MFN (most-favored nation),” Vargo said, referring to the long-established principle that all WTO members provide each other the same degree of market access.   Abandoning MFN would allow groups of WTO members to strike deals to liberalize trade in a particular services or manufacturing sector, but bar countries that don’t want to open their own markets from benefiting from the pact.

27,PG,"Ex-Goldman director Gupta, SEC to drop litigation","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) director Rajat Gupta and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are dropping litigation against each other stemming from the sprawling federal insider trading probe.  The agreement, revealed Thursday in a court filing, for now ends litigation against Gupta, a former chief of consulting firm McKinsey & Co and one of the highest-profile defendants accused by the government of wrongdoing.  Investigators have said Gupta passed tips to Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam about Goldman, including a possible multibillion dollar investment from Warren Buffett, and Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), where Gupta was also a director.  Prosecutors named Gupta as an unindicted co-conspirator in that case, which led to Rajaratnam’s conviction in May, but have not charged him criminally.  Citing the “public interest,” the SEC dismissed administrative proceedings filed on March 1 accusing Gupta of passing tips illegally to Rajaratnam.  “Dismissing these proceedings will not prevent the Commission from filing an action against Mr. Gupta in United States District Court,” the dismissal order shows.  As a result of the dismissal, Gupta agreed to dismiss his lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court against the SEC.  In it, Gupta accused the regulator of depriving him of a jury trial and other procedural safeguards by bringing administrative proceedings rather than filing a lawsuit.  A two-page letter agreement between Gupta and the SEC was made public on Thursday by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who presided over Gupta’s lawsuit. He said that agreement will moot that case.  “Mr. Gupta is very pleased that as a result of his lawsuit the SEC has dismissed its administrative proceeding and he will no longer be singled out for disparate treatment,” his lawyer Gary Naftalis said in a statement. “Mr. Gupta’s lawsuit against the SEC has achieved all of the relief he sought. As we’ve said previously, the SEC’s allegations are totally baseless.”  SEC spokesman John Nester said: “The staff is fully committed to the case and will proceed as appropriate.”  A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in New York declined to comment.  Gupta had been accused by the SEC of passing advance tips about Goldman’s financial results, and a $5 billion investment from Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) at the height of the 2008 financial crisis.  On May 11, a federal jury convicted Rajaratnam of 14 securities fraud and conspiracy charges related to insider trading.  At Rajaratnam’s trial, prosecutors played secretly recorded phone calls to show Gupta’s alleged tips.  In one, Rajaratnam and Gupta discussed a Goldman board meeting. In another, Rajaratnam told a Galleon colleague that a Goldman director provided him with details that the bank was on track for a surprise loss in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Rajaratnam is expected to be sentenced in the criminal case on September 27. He also faces SEC civil charges.  The case is Gupta v.

30,PG,UPDATE 2-Price hikes drive Unilever's Q2 growth," * Q2 underlying sales rise 7.1 pct vs consensus 5.5 pct   * Priorities remain profitable volume growth and margin improvement   * H1 earning up 10 pct, operating margin off 0.2 percentage points   * Commodity cost outlook remains unchanged   * Shares up 4.3 percent   (Adds CFO comments, analysts, shares)	   By David Jones	   LONDON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Consumer goods giant Unilever Plc/NV (UNc.AS) raised its prices sharply in the second quarter to offset higher commodity costs, helping it beat forecasts with a 7.1 percent increase in quarterly sales growth.	   The Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and Dove soaps group suffered a fall in margins due to the time lag between the hike in costs and the rise in its own prices, but Chief Executive Paul Polman forecast an improvement in the second half as the higher prices and costs savings take effect.	   Growth was driven by the group’s big emerging market presence in Asia, Africa and Latin America and helped by hot weather in Europe for its ice cream and beverage business, as well as its decision to increase prices more than 5 percent.	   Unilever Plc shares had gained 4.3 percent to 19.87 pounds by 0720 GMT. Analysts said second quarter sales showed a clear acceleration and the margin fall was less than expected.	   “Unilever’s results in our view look impressive,” said analyst Graham Jones at brokers Panmure Gordon, while Sara Welford at Citi said, “Headlines are good and Unilever has shown signs of improvement in Q2.”	   Unilever maintained its forecast that commodity costs would be 15 percent higher this year and said cost savings would be “in excess” of its previous target of 1.3 billion euros. 	   “We have very good oversight for commodity costs for 2011 and we are around 90 percent covered while most of our price rises have been made,” said Finance Director Jean-Marc Huet in a conference call after Thursday’s results.	   The group stuck to his 2011 goals of profitable sales volume growth ahead of its markets and higher profit margins despite cost inflation and tough trading in the mature markets of Western Europe and the United States.	   The Anglo-Dutch firm posted second-quarter underlying sales growth of 7.1, beating a company compiled consensus of 5.5 percent, but coming in below rival Danone which posted growth of 8.8 percent last week. 	    All food groups are grappling with soaring costs but Unilever’s heavy reliance on vegetable oils and chemicals for its spreads business and skin and laundry products is putting it  at a disadvantage to rival groups like Danone and Nestle  who see costs rising 10 percent or less.	   Nestle reports next week. 	   Unilever, which counts Knorr, Lipton, and Sunsilk among its biggest brands, reported half-year earnings up 10 percent to 0.77 euro a share beating a consensus of 0.71 euros while the six-month operating margin fell 0.2 percentage points compared a forecast for a 0.5 point fall.	   It paid a quarterly dividend of 0.225 euros a share, up 8 percent.	   Unilever warned in April its commodity costs were spiralling higher and would rise 15 percent this year to put an extra 2.4 billion euros on its annual commodity and packaging annual bill, bringing it to around 15 billion euros.

32,PG,P&G; results top views; quarter outlook falls short,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co is likely to miss Wall Street earnings estimates this quarter as it has not yet pushed through all its price increases that are meant to help deal with higher commodity costs.  Sluggish economies in major markets such as the United States also weighed on the company.  The world’s largest household products maker posted a bigger-than-expected rise in fourth-quarter profit on Friday, aided by cost cuts, some early price increases and, analysts said, a better-than-anticipated tax rate.  P&G’s initial wide forecast for fiscal 2012 suggests this year’s profit could meet expectations, though the company sees commodity costs weighing on results this quarter.  Shares of P&G, whose lineup includes Gillette razors and Olay skin creams, were up slightly at $60.12 after the results and data from the U.S. Labor Department showed that private employers stepped up hiring in July.  Analysts said parts of the quarterly report were of poor quality, such as gross margin down 1.2 percentage points.  “Overall, we find the result disappointing, albeit unsurprising,” said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Astrachan, “given macro uncertainty and continued weak consumer spending in developed markets.”  Consumers are still buying the company’s products, although sales are better in developing markets, where P&G sells more of its lower-priced items.  That is likely to continue to be the case in the near term.  “We’ve not seen dramatic changes in consumer behavior over the last few months,” said Chief Executive Officer Bob McDonald.  Shares of P&G and other major consumer products companies are often seen as safe havens. Lately, however, the stock has underperformed the market. P&G shares fell 7.3 percent from the beginning of the year through Thursday’s broad market sell-off. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index was down just 4.6 percent over the same period.  P&G has been raising prices to help offset the increase in costs for oil-based materials and other goods. It already announced or implemented price increases on brands that account for about 60 percent of its U.S. sales so far this calendar year, said McDonald.  P&G has also pulled back on some promotional spending as other household products makers have been doing, he added. That also has the effect of raising prices for consumers.  P&G, the world’s largest advertiser, will keep spending on marketing and research and development as it tries to entice shoppers to buy higher-priced products such as Crest 3D White toothpaste and Fusion ProGlide razors.  P&G spent $9.3 billion, or 11.3 percent of sales, on advertising in fiscal 2011. That is more than the annual revenue of competitors such as Church & Dwight Co Inc, Clorox Co or Estee Lauder Cos Inc.  FIRST-QUARTER PROFIT VIEW BELOW STREET  While P&G is seeing growth in emerging markets such as China, they are still smaller markets for the company, which got just 24 percent of 2010 sales from Asia and Latin America.  The United States is by far the company’s largest market, accounting for 38 percent of total sales in 2010, the latest year for which such geographic data is available.  The average customer in China spends less than $3 a year on P&G’s products, while in the United States the average is nearly $100, McDonald said.  On Thursday, P&G rival Unilever registered strong sales helped by price increases and growth in emerging markets.  P&G expects sales and earnings to be stronger in the second half of the year than the first half. Overall, the company expects to spend roughly $1.8 billion to $2 billion more on commodities this year, on top of the $1.8 billion increase it saw in fiscal 2011, said Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller.  For the first quarter ending in September, P&G forecast earnings per share of $1.00 to $1.04 from continuing operations, with organic sales up 2 percent to 4 percent.  For the fiscal year, P&G said it expected earnings per share of $4.17 to $4.33 from continuing operations, with organic sales up 3 percent to 6 percent.  Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.14 this quarter and $4.26 this year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  P&G earned $2.51 billion, or 84 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended in June, compared with $2.19 billion, or 71 cents per share, a year earlier.  Analysts expected earnings of 82 cents per share.  Sales rose 10 percent to $20.86 billion, while analysts had forecast $20.63 billion.  Organic sales, which strip out the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange fluctuations, rose 5 percent. About 1 percentage point of that growth probably came from retailers buying products ahead of price increases, Moeller said. The volume of goods sold rose 3 percent.

40,PG,"Financial advisers have ""black Monday"" blues","NEW YORK (Reuters) - For plenty of financial advisers — who also serve as quasi-therapists, spiritual gurus and confidantes — Monday was bad.  Really bad.  The S&P 500 posted its largest drop — more than 6 percent — in nearly three years, sparked by rising fears of a recession and fueled by the United States’ loss of its perfect triple-A credit rating. Panicked selling on heavy volume resulted in the S&P’s worst day since December 2008 — every stock in the benchmark index’s components ended the session in negative territory.  An adviser at a brokerage giant Merrill Lynch office in a Philadelphia suburb said the phones rang off the hook all day.  “Thank goodness for people who are on vacation and not calling in, although many are,” she said, asking not to be identified by name due to company policy. “Every call is too long. Tons of emails. Everyone doing conference calls, which are pretty much worthless.”  She turned down the television volume several times and “thought about putting on the Food Channel.”  Alan Haft, an independent financial adviser in Newport Beach, California, said his phone was buzzing with calls from clients wanting to “sell everything.”  “One calls saying the Mayan Calendar is coming true, that he’s absolutely certain this really is the beginning of the end of the world,” Haft said.  The eight money managers at Capital Investment Advisors in Atlanta started their day with an emergency 8 a.m. EDT meeting to review the situation. The good news? “We don’t think this is 2008,” said Mitch Reiner, chief operating officer at the firm.  Reiner said more aggressive clients took advantage of cheap prices, adding Intel, Procter & Gamble, Eli Lilly and other large-cap dividend stocks to their portfolios.  But one “very conservative client” wanted to know he wasn’t among the bargain hunters. Reiner’s response: “Because you can’t handle being down 3 percent.”  Trying to talk people off a ledge is never easy. Several advisers said it was even more difficult on Monday because they already talked clients off the ledge last week when the U.S. debt deal was sealed.  But several advisers who focus on long-term financial planning say their phones were quiet on Monday.  Richard Coppa, managing director at Wealth Health in Roseland, New Jersey, fielded just three calls from clients, “which honestly, is a good sign,” he said. And the clients he did connect with are “disgusted with our government, more than anything.” Added Patricia Powell, a certified financial planner at Powell Financial Group in Martinsville, New Jersey: “It is deadly quiet. I have not received a single client call or email about the markets today.”  One theory is that financial institutions are panicking more than retail investors. “My inbox is getting flooded with their “take” on the market slide, ratings downgrade, etc.,” said Ori Pagovich of Gotham Financial Services in New York. “Everyone either has a Webex, Webinar, white paper, update or anything in between on the events of the last two business days.”  With every big downturn comes opportunity, though.  “While clients are certainly concerned about recent market activity, they are not panicking; some have viewed the current pullback in the market as a potential buying opportunity,” said Joe Jennings, investment director for PNC Wealth Managementin Baltimore.  Monday was one of the heaviest trading days at ING Direct Investing. All told, the firm processed about 50,000 individual orders, which amounts to about 100 per minute, said Dan Greenshields, president of the ING Groep NV unit.  And there were more buyers than sellers who snapped up Apple and General Electric, along with several exchange-traded funds, such as SPDR S&P 500, SPDR Gold Trust and Powershares QQQ Trust.The bulk of that buying came from individuals aged 21 to 39. “People with long time horizons are buying,” Greenshields says.  Margaret Black-Scott, who is president and CEO of Beverly Hills Wealth Management, has been talking up Coke, Proctor & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson to her clients. It’s a variation on the mantra “know what you own” coined by Peter Lynch, the legendary manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund.  “Take a look on your pantry shelf. What do you have there that you have to have?” said Black-Scott. “Do you drink lots of tea or coffee or eat breakfast cereal?

An improved sales outlook and an 8 percent rise in core quarterly profit also boosted its shares on Wednesday.	   Henkel, whose brands include Persil detergents in most of Europe, Schwarzkopf hair products and Loctite glue, said it managed to increase selling prices across all divisions in the past quarter, including in its laundry and homecare division for the first time since 2009.	   “We see further price rises in raw materials and packaging and because of that we want to increase our prices in the second half,” Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted told journalists on Wednesday.	   Chief Financial Officer Lothar Steinebach told analysts he expected the worst of the impact from higher input costs in the second and third quarters.	   Rivals Procter & Gamble , whose products include Gillette razors and Olay skin creams, and Unilever  (UNc.AS), home to the Dove, Knorr and Lipton brands, have also increased prices this year in response to soaring costs for commodities like oil, plastics and chemicals.   	   Henkel shares led German blue chips after the group said it now expected sales growth adjusted for currencies and portfolio changes of 5 percent in 2011, at the top end of a previous range of 3-5 percent.	   The Dax bluechip index was up 1.1 percent at 1201 GMT.	   Henkel confirmed guidance for an adjusted EBIT margin — earnings before interest and tax as a percentage of sales — of around 13 percent, and for adjusted earnings per preferred share to rise by about 10 percent.	   DZ Bank analyst Thomas Maul said there had been fears Henkel may cut its guidance as a result of higher input costs.

47,PG,Wal-Mart to show if U.S. stores are back to growth," * Wal-Mart to report Q2 earnings on Tuesday morning   * Company EPS forecast $1.05-$1.10, analysts’ view $1.08   * U.S. same-store sales view down 1 pct to up 1 pct   * Analysts’ U.S. same-store sales view down 0.6 pct    By Jessica Wohl	   CHICAGO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Turning around a prolonged U.S. sales slump is key to Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s success, and Tuesday’s results will show if the retailer’s strategies to mend its biggest business have really started to pay off.	   Wal-Mart is making every effort to offer the best prices on a wider variety of goods in order to win over shoppers who have gone to other chains, such as dollar stores, and who continue to cut back on spending as high unemployment and other economic troubles persist.	   The world’s largest retailer has suffered two consecutive years of declines in sales at U.S. Wal-mart stores open at least a year. It predicted that U.S. same-store sales would return to positive territory this year, maybe as soon as the second quarter, though most industry-watchers predict the return to growth at its biggest unit will take a bit longer.	   In May, Wal-Mart forecast same-store sales at the Wal-mart chain in the United States, excluding fuel, would be down 1 percent to up 1 percent. Analysts, on average, expect to see a 0.6 percent decline, according to Thomson Reuters data.	   “They are having to get more competitive on pricing just as inflation is hitting,” Wall Street Strategies analyst Brian Sozzi said of Wal-Mart.	   As Wal-Mart works to offer the lowest prices, manufacturers from Kellogg Co to Procter & Gamble Co are trying to raise prices as they pay more for essentials such as grains and oil-based materials, highlighting the pressures facing major companies, not to mention the low-income shoppers trying to buy their goods.	   Raymond James analyst Budd Bugatch checked prices on a variety of groceries on Aug. 11, and found that Wal-mart’s price advantage on branded goods narrowed versus Target Corp  and Publix after two months of expansion. Wal-mart was still the price leader, but to a lesser extent than in July.	   At the same time, the price of a basket of goods sold under Wal-mart’s Great Value private brand fell for just the second time in the 14 months Bugatch has tracked such data, he said.	   Wal-mart’s everyday low-price strategy now includes stepped-up advertising behind its guarantee to match competitors’ prices. The company is also busy bringing thousands of items such as fishing lures and fabric back to thousands of stores to satisfy shoppers.	   Wal-mart U.S. is Wal-Mart’s biggest unit by far, accounting for $260.3 billion, or 62.1 percent, of sales in fiscal 2011, so growth in the business is crucial.	   For now, strong results from its smaller international units and Sam’s Club warehouse club unit should continue to help mitigate the impact of the U.S. slump.

48,PG,Unilever targets emerging markets for 75 percent of sales,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Consumer goods group Unilever (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS) expects to see three-quarters of its turnover from emerging markets by 2020 as heavy investment in these fast-growing regions and sluggish growth elsewhere take effect.  “Europe and the U.S. will be, for the next 10 years, low-growth territories, I’m afraid. So, soon we will have 75 percent of our turnover in emerging markets ... 70-75 percent by the end of decade,” Chief Executive Paul Polman said in an interview.  “This is also where the 2 billion more people will be born in the next 40 years, and obviously where most of the world growth is going to be.”  The CEO of German detergent and glue maker Henkel (HNKG_p.DE) made a similar prognosis of a swing in growth to emerging markets from Europe over the next 10 years in an interview on Wednesday.  Unilever and its brands like Knorr, Hellmann’s, Dove and Sunsilk already derive a higher proportion of sales in emerging markets now — 55 percent — than key rivals Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and Nestle NESN.VX.  The Anglo-Dutch group’s growth is driven by its big presence in Asia, Africa and Latin America, with Brazil, India, China and Turkey among its fastest growing markets.  “So we are by any standards the emerging market company. We are growing by 10 percent or more now consistently in the emerging markets, and that’s a very healthy growth. We can continue to grow at a 4 to 6 percent range overall. It’s a healthy growth,” Polman told Reuters late on Tuesday in Istanbul.  Unilever Plc shares had gained 1.92 percent to 20.74 pounds by 7:35 a.m. EDT in a falling London market.  Unilever raised its prices sharply in the second quarter to offset higher commodity costs, helping it beat forecasts with a 7.1 percent increase in quarterly underlying sales, and Polman said the group should be able to grow underlying sales at 4-6 percent a year into the future.  “Broadly, as a company we think we have priced ahead of our competitors in some cases, and we now need to see our competitors moving their prices before we would look at other things. That is happening right now, and we feel more or less happy with our pricing,” he added.  Sales growth is ahead of the market and will remain so, Polman said.  “If markets remain healthy, there is no reason why we cant maintain this top-line growth we are now showing.”  Polman also said as part of the company’s plan to divide Unilever into eight mega regions, Unilever Turkey will be responsible for North Africa, Middle East, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, increasing Turkey’s responsibility from 12 to 36 countries.  Turkey is a very important part of Unilever’s plan to boost the share of emerging markets in its turnover, Polman said.  The country is attracting international investors’ interest, with one of the highest economic growth rates globally. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 11 percent in the first quarter.  Unilever is building its eighth factory in the province of Konya in central Turkey, Polman said, with an ice-cream section projected to cost around $100 million. The company easily invests 100 million lira a year in Turkey, Polman said.  Unilever also plans to make Turkey a center for its halal food, Polman said.

49,PG,HOW TO PLAY IT: Market turmoil shakes up investor options," THE ISSUE: Three weeks of roller-coaster equity markets have left many investors exhausted and financial advisers searching for answers. We talked to some advisers about real-world options, geared to clients’ risk tolerance.   By Joseph A. Giannone and Jessica Toonkel   NEW YORK, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Income-generating stocks and bonds can provide stability and reassurance during volatile periods.   Andrew Morse, a veteran broker at HighTower Advisors LLC in New York, steers some of his affluent clients toward dividend-paying companies with modest debt loads and operations in faster-growing regions such as Asia.   One such company is McDonald’s Corp. (MCD.N), the $88 billion fast-food giant that pays a nearly 3 percent dividend yield and in July beat estimates by reporting a 5 percent rise in sales.   Todd Morgan, senior managing partner of Bel Air Investment Advisors in Los Angeles, says many of his clients had moved assets to cash and bonds ahead of the recent downturn. That allowed them to redeployed into high-dividend stocks at discounted prices last week.   Investors could do well, he said, with blue chips like Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) shares, each of which yields more than Treasury bonds.   “What would you rather own for the next 10 years?,” asks Morgan, whose firm oversees $6.5 billion.   P&G shares yield 3.45 percent, while Johnson & Johnson stock pays 3.6 percent. By comparison, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was yielding 2.1 percent on Friday.   Investors averse to stock-picking might embrace vehicles such as the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (SDY.P), a passive fund comprised of dividend paying stocks, or the Manning & Napier Dividend Focus mutual fund (MNDFX.O).   The mutual fund is down nearly 10 percent since July 22, and the S&P Dividend ETF is down 12 percent in the same period, smaller declines than the 16 percent drop in the S&P 500 Index.   Exchange-traded funds are generally thought of as efficient vehicles for both small and large players to play the market.   Taking a short position on the $2.7 billion iShares MSCI Germany ETF (EWG.P) could be a good strategy to profit from Europe’s fiscal woes, said Paul Justice, an ETF analyst at Morningstar.   “Germany is export-driven and if Europe continues to suffer, Germany will suffer disproportionately,” he said.   Investors bearish on the United States and its financial services companies may want to short the $4.8 billion Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF.P), which sank 21 percent in the past month, he said.   Those who expect market volatility to persist can purchase securities based on the CBOE’s Market Volatility Index, such as the $1.3 billion iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures exchange-traded note (VXX.P) The index has roughly doubled since July 22, when the recent market swoon began.   Advisers and clients with a real taste for risk can try leveraged and inverse ETFs, said Tom Lydon, president of Global Trends Investments, an adviser managing $95 million.   “These are for people who are watching the markets every day,” he said. “You can’t just buy them and hold on because they don’t correlate exactly to the market over long periods.”   The Securities and Exchange Commission, FINRA and state securities regulators have issued warnings about the dangers of owning leveraged or inverse ETFs, which amplify risks by using debt and derivatives.   Advisers said it’s important to discuss investments in difficult times.   “Clients are starting to understand that abnormal is normal,” said Howard Sontag, whose New York-based Sontag Advisory LLC manages $5 billion in assets for super-wealthy families. “We cannot control market volatility, but we can build a portfolio that gives our clients some comfort.”  ",8192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/brokers-investing/how-to-play-it-market-turmoil-shakes-up-investor-options-idUSN1E77I0CS20110819

51,PG,Clorox can wait for Icahn to fail -traders,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Traders who bet on deals are putting low odds on billionaire investor Carl Icahn making any inroads at Clorox Co (CLX.N).  Clorox is unlikely to ever see the $10.3 billion offered by Icahn since the takeover bid is contingent on his nominees wiping clean the bleach company’s board and starting an auction, merger arbitrageurs said.  Icahn lowered his takeover bid for Clorox on Tuesday, but said his offer would serve as a back-stop if an auction of the company failed.  Icahn, Clorox’s largest shareholder with a 9.51 percent stake, has launched a proxy fight after the board rejected two of his earlier buyout offers.  “Wiping away the entire board won’t be easy,” said one arbitrageur, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. “This is not a board that’s been asleep at the switch. It’s an active board that’s been producing.”  In the fiscal fourth-quarter, Clorox said its profit fell less than expected and that costs in the current fiscal year will rise less than it previously thought.  Clorox’s stock has risen about 12 percent this year, but it is trading about 13 percent below Icahn’s latest $78 bid.  “The $78 number is fictitious. It’s backstop offer to an auction that may never happen. The auction only happens if shareholders vote Icahn’s entire slate in and the chances of that are slim,” said a second arbitrageur, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media.  A defeat at Clorox would add to recent disappointments for the corporate raider-turned-activist, who is known to take on battles at several companies at the same time. This month he has turned up the heat on Clorox after setbacks in other ventures.  Icahn revealed his new bid for Clorox on the same day he gave up on his bid for control of film studio Lions Gate Entertainment Corp LGF.N after a lengthy battle.  He kicked off his proxy fight at Clorox two weeks ago, the day after he lost a battle to get board seats at another target, Forest Laboratories FRX.N.  Icahn’s fortunes are far from even. He did manage to see his years-long investment in Motorola turn around this month when Google Inc (GOOG.O) agreed to buy Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc (MMI.N) for $12.5 billion.  Clorox earlier slammed Icahn’s latest bid as an “inadequate, highly conditional proposal” and said the billionaire was looking to fund up to half of the purchase price by borrowing from its shareholders.  Icahn has said his bid was at least half cash, with the rest in bonds.  Icahn and Clorox could not be immediately reached for comment.  Icahn has said that synergies resulting from a deal with a strategic buyer could make even a $100-per-share offer viable for the likes of Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), Unilever Plc (ULVR.L), Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N), Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB.L), Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N), Henkel AG (HNKG_p.DE), and privately held SC Johnson.  But analysts and investors have raised questions about another bidder emerging.  “Clorox has a mix of products that a Unilever or P&G don’t need to have. And no private equity firm is going to get financing to come in there and pick and choose what they want,” the second arbitrageur said.  Wells Fargo Securities analyst Timothy Conder added, “We continue to believe there is little chance other strategic buyers will emerge at a price superior to Icahn’s $80 offer or his $78 back stop.”  Clorox, so far, has not faced a shareholder uprising to begin talks with Icahn or consider his offer.  For now, the 99-year-old company can sit back and wait for Icahn’s slate of board nominees to fail, said one consumer investment banker, who is not involved with the company.  “Clorox doesn’t have to launch a defensive move. They don’t need to breakup the company or launch some exotic restructuring. They just sit back and wait for Icahn’s slate to fail. The stock is below Icahn’s offer — no one feels that there’s a real alternative out there,” the arbitrageur said.  Clorox’s shares closed down 1 percent at $69.01 on Thursday.

Icahn revealed his new bid for Clorox on the same day he gave up on his bid for control of film studio Lions Gate Entertainment Corp LGF.N after a lengthy battle.  He kicked off his proxy fight at Clorox two weeks ago, the day after he lost a battle to get board seats at another target, Forest Laboratories FRX.N.  Icahn’s fortunes are far from even. He did manage to see his years-long investment in Motorola turn around this month when Google Inc (GOOG.O) agreed to buy Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc (MMI.N) for $12.5 billion.  Clorox earlier slammed Icahn’s latest bid as an “inadequate, highly conditional proposal” and said the billionaire was looking to fund up to half of the purchase price by borrowing from its shareholders.  Icahn has said his bid was at least half cash, with the rest in bonds.  Icahn and Clorox could not be immediately reached for comment.  Icahn has said that synergies resulting from a deal with a strategic buyer could make even a $100-per-share offer viable for the likes of Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), Unilever Plc (ULVR.L), Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N), Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB.L), Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N), Henkel AG (HNKG_p.DE), and privately held SC Johnson.  But analysts and investors have raised questions about another bidder emerging.  “Clorox has a mix of products that a Unilever or P&G don’t need to have. And no private equity firm is going to get financing to come in there and pick and choose what they want,” the second arbitrageur said.  Wells Fargo Securities analyst Timothy Conder added, “We continue to believe there is little chance other strategic buyers will emerge at a price superior to Icahn’s $80 offer or his $78 back stop.”  Clorox, so far, has not faced a shareholder uprising to begin talks with Icahn or consider his offer.  For now, the 99-year-old company can sit back and wait for Icahn’s slate of board nominees to fail, said one consumer investment banker, who is not involved with the company.  “Clorox doesn’t have to launch a defensive move. They don’t need to breakup the company or launch some exotic restructuring. They just sit back and wait for Icahn’s slate to fail. The stock is below Icahn’s offer — no one feels that there’s a real alternative out there,” the arbitrageur said.  Clorox’s shares closed down 1 percent at $69.01 on Thursday.

55,PG,Henkel CEO confident for 2011 as gains market share," DUESSELDORF, Germany, Sept 6 (Reuters) - German washing powder and shampoo maker Henkel (HNKG_p.DE) is confident of reaching its targets for 2011 despite stock market turbulence and fears of a renewed recession, its chief executive said.	   “The situation is serious but not comparable with 2008,” Kasper Rorsted said at an event on Monday evening. “At Henkel, we are doing very, very well.”	   Denmark-born Rorsted, who has headed the maker of Persil detergents, Pritt Stick glue and Schwarzkopf hair products since April 2008, said the group was winning market share and emerging countries were driving profits.	   Rosted had said in an interview with Reuters last month that Henkel sees 50 percent of its revenue coming from emerging countries such as China and Brazil by 2015, compared with 40 percent currently. 	   He added on Monday the group was busy preparing its strategy for the next eight to 10 years, due to be published in the final quarter of 2012.	   The group expects 2011 sales to rise about 5 percent. It is targeting an adjusted EBIT margin of around 13 percent in 2011 and 14 percent for 2012. 	   Henkel, which competes in the consumer products market with companies such as Procter & Gamble and Unilever , also supplies industrial glues for customers such as carmakers.	   Rorsted said Japan had almost fully recovered from the earthquake and tsunami and that carmakers there would ramp up production to six days a week.

56,PG,Restructuring questions loom for P&G; executives,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Top Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) executives can expect to be peppered with questions about an impending restructuring when they speak with investors at a major industry conference on Thursday.  P&G will fully leave the food business once it sells Pringles to Diamond Foods Inc DMND.O later this year, and Chief Executive Bob McDonald has raised expectations for a restructuring announcement soon after.  “We don’t have it fully baked yet but we’ll update you on that when we announce the closure of that deal,” McDonald said during an August 5 conference call.  P&G usually restructures without the public taking much notice. It typically absorbs hundreds of millions of dollars in restructuring costs each year rather than spelling them out as one-time charges or unusual items.  But the pressure is on for the maker of Tide detergent to show what it is doing to improve in the face of ongoing sluggishness in its core markets such as the United States and Europe.  P&G already has some big changes in store. In addition to the Pringles sale, it is joining forces with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd TEVA.O to sell over-the-counter medicines.  Both of those moves provide the opportunity for P&G to take a closer look at its staffing levels.  McDonald and Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller are set to speak at the Barclays Capital Back to School Consumer Conference in Boston on Thursday and interest in their plans is expected to be high.  Analysts repeatedly asked during last month’s quarterly conference call about the possibility of a restructuring.  McDonald said then that P&G was thinking about a separate non-core charge this year. It took one when it sold Folgers to J M Smucker Co (SJM.N).  In fiscal 2009, the company took 9 cents per share in Folgers-related restructuring charges.  “We’re contemplating something similar on Pringles,” McDonald said on the August 5 call.  Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj raised his rating on P&G to “outperform” soon after that call because he felt that the company’s management “has realized that it needs to conduct a sizable restructuring.”  For the past several years, P&G has taken internal charges of around $300 million to $400 million, said BMO Capital Markets analyst Connie Maneaty.  P&G could take a charge of around $1.5 billion that will save it $1 billion a year and cut its employee base by about 4,000, said Maneaty. Such a move could add 25 cents per share to earnings through 2013, although the company may only record about half of that 25 cent-per-share benefit, she said.  Last year, P&G spent about $250 million on restructuring, an amount McDonald called “relatively low,” as part of its ongoing effort to simplify operations.  Dibadj said a restructuring should be in the $2 billion to $5 billion range over the next several years “to be even adequate” and said he would be disappointed if the company set one that was not big enough or did not announce one at all.  Cincinnati-based P&G is also working on cutting its number of manufacturing platforms from more than 500 two years ago to about 150 by 2014. That move could be worth about $500 million in savings, McDonald told shareholders in his annual letter.

58,PG,Analysis: AOL's Armstrong feeling the heat with Project Devil,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Forget the Michael Arrington sideshow — AOL boss Tim Armstrong has a bigger problem, involving the “Project Devil” advertising unit.  Project Devil, which is a large-ad format with interactive panels that dominate a Web page, is still striving to gain traction among ad buyers since its glitzy debut during New York Advertising Week last September. The problem is that other websites have been slow to embrace the platform, one of Armstrong’s main initiatives to boost advertising revenue.  “Project Devil has a lot of positive qualities,” said Tracey Scheppach, founder of The Pool, at the digital agency VivaKi. “The hard part is finding people to use the unit.”  The sluggish uptake for Project Devil could only hamper AOL’s strategy under Armstrong to lessen its dependence on its fast-dwindling but lucrative dial-up business. AOL aims to do that by becoming a leading content destination on the Web, backed mainly by advertising revenue.  Project Devil’s slow start adds more pressure on Armstrong, who took over a struggling AOL and since has grasped at several strategies, including splashy acquisitions — the Huffington Post, TechCrunch — and ambitious projects like Patch.  AOL has also been through several staff shake-ups, the last of which was an overhaul of its ad sales department and the ouster of its top salesman in July.  His latest headache involves TechCrunch founder Arrington and a controversial venture capital fund launched by Arrington and backed by AOL. Questions linger whether Arrington is still employed by AOL, given the protests about the fund’s ability to invest in companies covered by TechCrunch.  Hailed as AOL’s savior only two years ago, Armstrong, could find himself on the hotseat if he fails to convince Wall Street that he finally has the Internet company on the right course.  Indeed, Carol Bartz’s ouster as Yahoo’s CEO serves as a cautionary tale for Armstrong. Her departure was precipitated, in part, by her failure to maintain Yahoo’s leadership position in display advertising.  In August, AOL reported second-quarter results that disappointed investors mainly because of weak display ad revenue growth, which forced the company to trim its operating profit outlook for the year. AOL shares plunged more than 30 percent on the news.  Part of the issue with Project Devil is that advertisers, who are pleased with the format, are reluctant to spend money building out a custom ad that only runs on AOL, said David Cohen, global digital officer at the ad agency UM. He added that he is a big advocate and partner of AOL and its efforts.  However, a handful of publishers including Hearst Magazines, the Wall Street Journal Digital Network, Meredith Corp and FoxNews.com have agreed to use the format on their own sites. Meredith, which publishes magazines such as Better Homes and Gardens and Ladies Home Journal, is still rolling out the ad units on its properties, for instance.  Rich Kim, vice president and associate media director at the ad agency RPA, thinks that about 100 of the top sites on comScore need to adopt the format before it can take off fully. Otherwise, he said, it becomes too costly to produce and place an ad that can’t reach a broad audience.  “I think (AOL) is on the right track,” said Kim. “I just wish something like this could be leveraged elsewhere as a more a cost effective solution for my clients. Right now it is hard justify.”  Plus, broad adoption could backfire, notes Michael Hays, president of digital communications worldwide at the ad firm Initiative. “As it becomes a standard size in theory, I don’t have to purchase that from AOL anymore and I can still get the bang from my buck,” he said.  CATCH-22  AOL has been pushing Project Devil on Madison Avenue and with other publishers and websites over the past year. But while the unit allows more of the innovation advertisers are seeking in their ads, it is not attracting enough eyeballs.  “What agencies are looking for is a broader canvas, and Project Devil gives us creative prowess,” said Vik Kathuria, managing partner at Mediacom. “At the same time we look for reach. Unfortunately, that is where they fall behind the pack,” he said, ticking off sites such as Facebook and Google’s YouTube as places that command bigger audiences than AOL.  The company is currently hosting 11 campaigns from the likes of Coca-Cola Co, Procter & Gamble Co, and Kraft Foods Inc that are using the unit. Armstrong pointed out during AOL’s earnings call in early August that consumers spend almost four times as long on a page with a Project Devil ad compared with industry averages.  One of the difficulties Project Devil faces involves getting websites used to the idea of replacing several smaller ads with one big ad on the page. “The commercial trade-off is that sites are going to sell one beautiful big ad as opposed to three or four small ads. That takes some courage,” said Peter Minnium, consulting director for industry group the Interactive Advertising Bureau.  The IAB gave AOL a huge vote of confidence when it named Project Devil one of its “Rising Stars.”  “It’s still early days,” the UM agency’s Cohen said. “If this is a marathon, they are probably in mile three or four.  AOL declined to comment for this article.  ",9082011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aol-devil/analysis-aols-armstrong-feeling-the-heat-with-project-devil-idUSTRE7876NY20110908
59,PG,Kleenex hopes cooling tissue will heat up sales,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Kleenex is hoping that consumers will pay significantly more per tissue to soothe their noses with coconut oil, aloe extract and ingredients often used in anti-aging creams.  The patent-protected Kleenex Cool Touch tissues cost about 65 percent more than other premium Kleenex tissues, but Kleenex owner Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N) thinks that consumers will be willing to pay extra, despite an economy that may be bordering on a double-dip recession.  Kleenex, which debuted in the 1920s, is a big business for Kimberly-Clark and one that is gaining market share even though shoppers have traded down to store branded goods in other categories such as paper towels and food.  Now, Kleenex hopes that despite the difficult economic climate, U.S. households will buy more than the average five boxes of tissues they purchase each year. A lot of that buying comes during the fall and winter, when cold and flu rates soar.  Kleenex Cool Touch tissues feel thicker than traditional tissues and react with body temperature to send a cooling sensation to people’s noses. They also cost a lot more than regular Kleenex.  “Consumers are willing to pay a premium for what they perceive to be a value-added benefit,” Craig Smith, Kleenex brand director, said in an interview.  In Kleenex’s research, shoppers were even willing to pay more than the price the company set for the new tissues, said Tracy Buelow, Kleenex senior brand manager.  Kleenex Cool Touch have a suggested price of $2.19 for a box of 50, or 4.38 cents per tissue, though initial prices will likely be lower to get people to try them. Kleenex lotion and ultra soft tissues, two other high-end varieties, go for $1.99 for a box of 75 tissues, or roughly 2.65 cents per tissue.  “Innovation has to come without the price, that’s the problem that we have in this environment,” said RBC Capital Markets household products analyst Jason Gere, who has an “outperform” rating on Kimberly-Clark.  “As long as the sticker price seems more in line with some of the other products out there it should do OK,” Gere said, referring to the price per box, not per tissue.  Tissues are one category where store branded products have had less of an impact. Different varieties of Kleenex rang up more than $461 million in U.S. sales during the 52 weeks ended on August 7, excluding sales at Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and wholesale chains such as Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), according to data from Chicago-based SymphonyIRI Group. While sales of Kleenex increased, sales of private label tissues fell, according to the firm’s data.  Kimberly-Clark said Kleenex gained 2 percentage points of market share in North America during the second quarter. Puffs, from Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), are a distant No. 2 player in the category.  “If you have a consumer who wants the lotion and all of that stuff they’re going to stick with a brand, whether it’s Kleenex or Puffs,” said Gere.  While Kimberly-Clark appears comfortable with its Kleenex pricing strategy for now, the company is keeping an eye on prices for northern bleached softwood kraft, a benchmark for pulp paper prices in the industry. The company is cutting costs to help offset the higher material costs it faces and is raising some prices.  Kimberly-Clark is basing expectations for the year on the price of pulp staying between $1,000 and $1,020 per metric ton, versus $970 in the first quarter and $1,030 in the second quarter, Chief Executive Tom Falk said during a July conference call.

The $615 million acquisition of potato chip company Kettle Foods Inc in 2010 and the $1.5 billion deal for Pringles have given Diamond Foods a foothold in a fragmented snack food market dominated by PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay snack business. 	   The company, which went public in 2005, has grown its sales substantially since 2008, after buying Pop Secret, a pop-corn business from General Mills Inc .	   On August 3, Diamond Foods got the last of its antitrust clearances required for its Pringles deal, which is expected to close in December of this year.	   The company — which also owns brands such as Emerald snack nuts, Pop Secret popcorn, and Diamond of California nuts — said snack food sales grew 16 percent in the latest reported quarter.	   Strong demand for the company’s snack food business has driven at least eight consecutive quarters of market-beating profits. Diamond Foods has also regularly raised its outlook over this period.	   For the full-year, the company now expects to earn $3.05-$3.10 per share on an adjusted basis. Analysts were expecting $3.10 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.	   It also forecast full-year net sales of $1.85-$1.95 billion, compared with the $965.9 million it reported in fiscal 2011. 	   Diamond Foods, which competes with privately held Blue Diamond Growers and industry giant Kraft Foods , earned 52 cents a share on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter. This topped market expectations of 44 cents a share.	   Revenue for the quarter rose 32 percent to $232.8 million, also surpassing analysts’ estimates of $216.3 million.

63,PG,HOW TO PLAY IT-Stocks that inspire consumer confidence," THE ISSUE: The Thomson Reuters/U of Michigan’s Consumer Confidence index rose slightly more than expected but remained at nearly the lowest level in years at 57.8. In a healthy economy, it would be over 70 percent.   By Sam Forgione   NEW YORK, Sept 16  (Reuters) - Consumers are still gloomy, and the retailing recovery that had been expected has failed to materialize.   That’s a disappointment for the investors who steadily boosted the S&P Retailing index from last August through July of this year. It has fallen since, in step with sagging reports on confidence like the one reported Friday.   What’s eating consumers? Unemployment is hovering around 9 percent. Add to it fears surrounding the U.S. debt ceiling and ratings down-grade and the Euro-zone crisis, and overall expectations have been at historic lows.   What should investors do? Avoid the sector all together?   In the view of three experts who follow the industry, it’s time to be picky.    Here are views of three experts on how to find companies that inspire confidence even when the Consumer Confidence survey sags:      One strategist, Kate Warne at Edward Jones, cited retail and consumer stocks that do well regardless of consumer confidence.   Among her retailing favorites, Kohl’s (KSS.N) was up 61 cents to $47.59 in afternoon trading or 1.30 percent, Target (TGT.N) was up $1.19 to $52.89 or 2.3 percent,  Tiffany (TIF.N) was up 55 cents to $75.38 in afternoon trading.   Her list topped the overall gain of the Standard & Poor’s Retailing Index .XRT which was up a modest half a percent.   In the broader consumer sector, she cited Colgate Palmolive (CL.N) , which was  up  1.15 percent to $93.35, and Procter & Gamble (PG.N) up $1.69 or 2.68 percent to $64.46.   She pointed to solid brands and retailers who can manage in a weak environment.    “Whether confident or not, consumers are going to buy toothpaste,” said Warne, explaining her choice of the two consumer giants.   “Kohl’s has a long track record of delivering good value for consumers. People are shifting to cheaper items and spending less,” she said.   Ross Stores Inc.(ROST.O), which specializes in low-priced brand merchandise and Limited Brands Inc.LTD.N, with moderately priced women’s fashion, are also safe choices for investors, according to another strategist   “We continue to believe LTD (Limited) and ROST (Ross) are well positioned for the second half given strong top-line momentum and the relatively lower cost pressure they face compared to many apparel retailers,” reported Paul Lejuez, CFA of Nomura Holdings, in a research note.   A third strategist is undaunted by the sluggish confidence report and sees the anticipated recovery still on track. The key test for the sector will come in the big season ahead as holidays approach.   “When looking into Q2 results from retailers, for the most part, reporting is in line with expectations. We haven’t seen any major indications of them pulling back yet,” said John Long, retail strategist at Kurt Salmon.   Long also cites back-to-school spending as a bright sign.”If we look at back-to-school as a bellwether for holiday sales, which history indicates is the case, then retailers will have a good season, and only a major unforeseen event could change that.”    ",9162011,http://www.reuters.com/article/howtoplayit-consumer/how-to-play-it-stocks-that-inspire-consumer-confidence-idUSS1E78F0UU20110916
64,PG,HOW TO PLAY IT: Don't be a volatility ostrich," THE ISSUE: Since the beginning of August, the Dow industrial average has had nine days with 300-point-plus losses. In the entire year before it, there were only two. How can investors manage in such a period of high volatility?   NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - For many investors, big market drops like the ones this week have a bring-on-the-blindfold effect.   Many people stop looking at online brokerage statements and avoid reading the financial news. The bottom line is that they really don’t want to talk about the bottom line at all (except for those who shout ‘sell everything’ at their broker.)   But tempting as it may be for everyone to bury their heads in the sand, the ostrich strategy really is not the best way to react to a downturn.   Obviously there are as many strategies as there are risk profiles and investment goals.   Here are four ways to keep your head above water when selling floods the markets:   Warren Buffett has made billions buying shares when they are down and selling when they are up.   But that does not mean to get swept up in the emotions of the moment. Knowing the inherent value of stocks is a requirement — Buffett isn’t throwing darts in a windstorm.  James T. Evans, portfolio manager at Thompson Investment Management, said, “There’s a lot of volatility on a daily and weekly basis...The less emotion the better off we are.”   Evans said he favors beaten-down financials, especially regional banks, and energy. He is selling technology because it has been outperforming and has less residual value.   Well-diversified investors have the satisfaction of knowing that at least part of their portfolio is rising when stocks collapse as they have in recent days. Bonds have continued to rise. Individual investors have moved heavily into fixed income since 2008 and for the most part it has paid off.   “Bonds are inversely correlated with stock prices.....Rarely do you get bond and stock prices going down. That diversification reduces volatility,” said John Largent, Chief Investment Officer at Members Trust Capital.   When a major disruption hits, many advisers say it could be time to consider adding to risk-averse, highly rated bonds. Individual bonds carry the same yield until maturity and it’s an income stream that holders can count on in an uncertain world.

65,PG,How to play it: Don't be a volatility ostrich,"THE ISSUE: Since the beginning of August, the Dow industrial average has had nine days with 300-point-plus losses. In the entire year before it, there were only two. How can investors manage in such a period of high volatility?  NEW YORK (Reuters) - For many investors, big market drops like the ones this week have a bring-on-the-blindfold effect.  Many people stop looking at online brokerage statements and avoid reading the financial news. The bottom line is that they really don’t want to talk about the bottom line at all (except for those who shout ‘sell everything’ at their broker.)  But tempting as it may be for everyone to bury their heads in the sand, the ostrich strategy really is not the best way to react to a downturn.  Obviously there are as many strategies as there are risk profiles and investment goals.  Here are four ways to keep your head above water when selling floods the markets:  Warren Buffett has made billions buying shares when they are down and selling when they are up.  But that does not mean to get swept up in the emotions of the moment. Knowing the inherent value of stocks is a requirement — Buffett isn’t throwing darts in a windstorm.  James T. Evans, portfolio manager at Thompson Investment Management, said, “There’s a lot of volatility on a daily and weekly basis...The less emotion the better off we are.”  Evans said he favors beaten-down financials, especially regional banks, and energy. He is selling technology because it has been outperforming and has less residual value.  Well-diversified investors have the satisfaction of knowing that at least part of their portfolio is rising when stocks collapse as they have in recent days. Bonds have continued to rise. Individual investors have moved heavily into fixed income since 2008 and for the most part it has paid off.  “Bonds are inversely correlated with stock prices.....Rarely do you get bond and stock prices going down. That diversification reduces volatility,” said John Largent, Chief Investment Officer at Members Trust Capital.  When a major disruption hits, many advisers say it could be time to consider adding to risk-averse, highly rated bonds. Individual bonds carry the same yield until maturity and it’s an income stream that holders can count on in an uncertain world.

Nestle shares gained over 1 percent in early trading as analysts said Wan Ling Martello’s experience of the retail industry and emerging markets would be a boost for the Vevey-based maker of Nescafe coffee and KitKat chocolate bars.	   Martello, 53, a U.S. citizen of Chinese and Philippine origin, currently at the world’s biggest retailer, will take over on April 1 from the 65-year-old Canadian James Singh who is retiring after 35 years with the Swiss food giant.	   “In addition to the further welcome modernisation of Nestle’s male-dominated upper echelons, we think the appointment makes sense,” said Kepler Capital Markets analyst Jon Cox.	   “She comes from Nestle’s biggest customer, she has experience in e-commerce ... emerging markets (key growth driver) and obviously brings a female multi-ethnic, emerging-market/Asian face to the world as Nestle’s representative,” he added.	    The Swiss group has a wide range of nationality across its senior management team and four of its fifteen board members are females. However, Martello will become the first female on Nestle’s 14-man executive committee since Petraea Heynike retired as head of all strategic business units in April.	   Nestle made the announcement late Tuesday that Martello, executive vice-president of global e-commerce for emerging markets at Wal-Mart since 2005, will join Nestle next year after a career in which she previously worked for Kraft Foods , Borden Foods, and NCH Marketing Services, a former subsidiary of Nielsen.	   She will work closely with 57-year-old Belgian chief executive Paul Bulcke, who has led the group since April 2008, with analysts expecting Nestle to be on the look out for acquisitions after selling its remaining stake in eyecare group Alcon and recently refraining from announcing a new share buyback programme.	   Martello follows a string of recent senior female appointments at European consumer goods groups, such as Alison Cooper taking over as chief executive at Imperial Tobacco  in May 2010, Diageo appointing Deirdre Mahlan as CFO in October 2010, and Liz Doherty taking over as Reckitt Benckiser CFO in January this year.	   “The surprise is that the new CFO is from outside Nestle... We believe however that Ms. Martello will bring a breadth of knowledge in finance, emerging markets, retailers and e-commerce, among others,” said Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy. 	   Bernstein analyst Andrew Wood said the fact that Martello came from outside Nestle with emerging market experience were positives, but her profile at Wal-Mart was not high and she did not appear to be a high-profile CFO appointment like Paul Polman in 2005, who came from Procter & Gamble and then went on to become chief executive at Unilever (UNc.AS)	   “It is tough to make a fully informed judgement on the news, principally based on a lack of knowledge of Martello.

The companies said they have revised the date of closing to the first half of 2012 from December 2011, after Diamond Foods received an external communication regarding its accounting for certain crop payments to walnut growers. In a separate statement, Procter & Gamble said the delay in the close of the transaction will not have any effect on the timing of its planned restructuring. The company also said it will provide an updated forecast shortly. The closing of the $1.5 billion Pringles sale will complete P&G;’s exit from the food business and make Diamond Foods the largest pure-play U.S. snack foods company.

80,PG,Michael Phelps ahead of opposition with London Olympic deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The 2012 London Olympics are still more than seven months away but Michael Phelps is already one of the biggest winners. The American swimmer, who has already won a record 14 Olympic gold medals and is expected to add to his glittering stockpile in London, has just signed a lucrative endorsement deal with the International Olympic Committee’s newest worldwide partner, Procter & Gamble. Under the terms of the deal, which was due to be formally announced later on Tuesday, Phelps will become the global face of an anti-dandruff shampoo and will feature prominently in their Wash in Confidence campaign. “Michael Phelps is a three-time Olympian and one of the most iconic global athletes of our time,” Belen Carazo, the director of global communications for Head & Shoulders told Reuters ahead of the announcement. “We feel that Michael Phelps is a great ambassador for confidence — when performing at the highest level of sport, there is simply no room for doubt.” P&G; said the contract with Phelps would run for two years, until 2013. The company would not reveal the financial terms of the deal although industry experts said the swimmer’s fee would almost certainly be a seven-figure sum. “At this point of his career, it’s not about financial remuneration for Michael,” Peter Carlisle, Phelps’ agent at sports marketing firm Octagon, told Reuters. “His promotion of a product has to go much deeper and allow him to accomplish more things. “Michael has always wanted to help grow the sport of swimming and he needs global brands that can help him spread his message all over the world.” Carlisle, who has worked with Phelps for around a decade, has been flooded by endorsement offers for his client but said less than 10 per cent ever get signed because of the complexity of striking a deal with the most decorated Olympian of all time and his ambition to spread his message worldwide. “He’s one of the few truly global ionic athletes, but only a few brands can really match him. That’s why this was such a compelling match for both sides,” Carlisle said. As much as anything else, the deal with P&G; also serves as testimony to Phelps’s rising popularity and pulling power after his record-breaking eight gold medal haul at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. His public image took a battering when the now defunct British tabloid News of the World published photographs of him inhaling from a glass pipe used for smoking marijuana, but he has survived unscathed. Phelps apologized and was suspended by USA Swimming for three months, but his sponsors stuck with him despite ongoing speculation they would ditch him en masse. Only Kellogg’s, whose deal with Phelps was about to expire shortly after the pictures were published, did not renew their contract with him. Phelps, now 26, weathered the storm and is steadily adding more companies to his bulging portfolio in the final countdown to London, his fourth and final Olympics before he hangs up his goggles. “Who would have thought, five years ago, that a swimmer would sign a deal for a hair product,” Phelps told Reuters in an interview. “But this was a good match and it’s a product I have actually used for years because I’m in chlorine so much. “My sponsors are like family. Some have been with me from step one. They have always supported me through the good times and bad times.” ",11152011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-phelps/michael-phelps-ahead-of-opposition-with-london-olympic-deal-idUSTRE7AE0DC20111115

82,PG,Former Procter & Gamble CEO John Smale dies at 84,"CINCINNATI (Reuters) - Former Procter & Gamble chief executive John G. Smale, credited with transforming the two major international companies he led during his career, died on Saturday at age 84. Smale served as chief executive officer of Cincinnati-based Procter & Gamble from 1981 to 1990. Under his watch, the company doubled sales to more than $24 billion and earnings to $1.6 billion, and expanded into 15 new product categories and 23 new countries. Smale, who also served as chairman, started with the company in 1952 working in dental products. He was credited with persuading the American Dental Association to endorse Crest, then a new product. Crest went on to become one of the company’s best-selling brands, helping catapult Smale into the limelight, according to Procter & Gamble’s website. In addition to his lauded business sense, those who worked with Smale inside the company and out remembered him as a kind, unpretentious man. “The man’s character was defined by all the things character is defined by: his wisdom, his courage, his persistent commitment to doing what’s right for the longer term — absolutely right down the line. Never compromising,” said John Pepper, Procter & Gamble’s CEO from 1995 to 1999. “John was the single most inspiring leader I have ever known. Period,” Pepper told Reuters. After Smale retired from Procter & Gamble, General Motors’ board picked him to lead that struggling company, and he helped get the automobile manufacturer profitable within two years, Pepper said. Smale served as chairman of the General Motors board from 1992 to 1995, according to that company’s website. He continued to serve on the GM board until 2002. Born in Ontario, Canada, he graduated from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, near Cincinnati, and later returned to his adopted hometown of Cincinnati to become one of its most respected business and civic leaders. “He was one of the most decent people,” said Charlie Luken, former Cincinnati mayor. “When his city asked him to, he stepped up.” In 1987, Luken asked Smale to chair a committee examining problems with the city’s aging infrastructure. The resulting plan was so comprehensive and successful that it became known as the Smale Commission and continues to have a lasting effect. “He loved his city and was he was always there,” Luken said. “Any time I would ask him to do something he would say, ‘Is there anything else I can do?’” ",11202011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-procterandgamble-smale-death/former-procter-gamble-ceo-john-smale-dies-at-84-idUSTRE7AJ00H20111120

85,PG,Manufacturing can thrive but struggles for respect,"BOSTON (Reuters) - On a quiet stretch of the waterfront here, about a mile from Boston’s main tourist sites, a Gillette factory hums along 24 hours a day making an unlikely commodity: top-of-the-line razors. The factory, which employs about 700 people in manufacturing as well as another 800 in design, engineering and management, is an anomaly in modern America - a manufacturing site in one of most expensive cities in the country. But to Gillette’s parent company, Procter & Gamble, Boston is an ideal base not only for making Fusion and Mach 3 razors, but to produce machines that assemble Gillette products around the world: After a century of making razors at the site, the company has a critical mass of experienced workers. “The guys in my world see the new products three to five years before anyone else,” said Ronald Calder, who runs the machine shop at the South Boston facility, which develops the equipment that produces many thousands of razors per day. Having his crew of machine makers a short walk from the people who manufacture the razors allows them to develop and fine-tune machines quickly and cheaply. That plays to what P&G; management regards as its strength. “Oftentimes, the basis for our competitive advantage in a category is the process or manufacturing operation that allows us to make better quality than our competitors at a lower cost,” said Bruce Brown, chief technology officer with the Cincinnati-based company. America’s debate over manufacturing has escalated in the face of stubbornly high unemployment and the realization that younger workers lack some of the basic skills necessary to hold down a job in an assembly plant or a fabrication shop. Gillette is facing that issue in part by putting interested factory workers through a technical training program at a nearby state university. One graduate of that program is Mike DiBella, 31, who started at the factory five years ago with a high school diploma and some vocational school experience. After the additional program, today he manages 14 machines that sharpen steel for blades. DiBella said he is never bored, enjoys the challenges of the job, and sees opportunities for growth. P&G; runs against the grain in corporate America in believing that the company’s manufacturing skill is a large part of the reason shoppers are willing to pay about $3.50 for a single Fusion razor cartridge. The company argues that manufacturing in-house and in Boston helps it to meet exacting standards for its razors, necessary since men would be less willing to pay premium prices if they cut themselves during their morning shaves. It is not just basic items like clothing and furniture that have migrated to offshore production. More complicated, and higher-tech products such as Apple Inc’s iPads and Nike Inc running shoes are largely made overseas, often in subcontracted factories not owned by the brands whose products they are making. Cheaper labor costs have been the main drivers of such production in China and elsewhere but with Chinese wage costs rising sharply, the yuan currency gaining against the U.S. dollar, and transport costs increasing, the advantage against the U.S. has narrowed a bit in recent years. Also the main downside of moving production to an outside contractor in a country like China is the danger of losing some control over quality and over intellectual property. Still, American manufacturing is now considered to be primarily the domain of makers of bigger-ticket, highly engineered products such as medical imaging devices and excavators, including General Electric Co, United Technologies Corp and Caterpillar Inc. And it’s not as if P&G; hasn’t weighed the options for the Boston site. When the company bought Gillette in 2005, it considered closing the 45-acre (18 hectare) facility. After deciding to keep it open, it then pulled the company’s white-collar staff out of the city’s iconic Prudential Tower and consolidated Boston operations onto the factory campus. Keeping both its manufacturing and the design of its machinery in-house makes it harder for rivals to knock off its designs, the company reasons. Mike Chaney, Gillette’s vice president of product supply, cites the line of Sensor razors, introduced in 1990 and no longer protected by patents, as an example. “Anyone could copy it, but they don’t because they don’t know how to make it efficiently,” said Chaney. The company has good reason to be protective of its razor business, as it is one of P&G;’s most profitable ventures. The company’s grooming division - which includes men’s razors, as well as other products including men’s deodorant but not women’s razors - notched a 20 percent profit margin in the fiscal year ended June 30, well above the company’s five other divisions, which make products ranging from Crest toothpaste to Pampers diapers. While a weak global economy and rising costs in emerging markets have led more companies to think like Proctor & Gamble, manufacturing experts say many executives have long looked at manufacturing operations too narrowly, focusing mainly on cost. Quick reductions to the cost of making a product, whether by moving production to a lower-cost region or handing it off entirely to another company, can provide a quick boost to profit margins but make it vulnerable to quality problems or theft of technology and designs. “They call it a cost center. It costs money rather than adds revenue,” said Jung-Hoon Chun, the director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Laboratory for Manufacturing and Productivity. “Because it’s a cost center, if you become a manager of the unit, if you get rid of that then from day one you get rid of costs.” That attitude has contributed to a slow decline in U.S. manufacturing employment. The sector currently employs about 12 million people in the United States, down from a peak of near 20 million around 1980. While many companies have reduced headcount due to productivity initiatives, cutting manufacturing too deeply can take its toll. The world’s largest cereal maker, Kellogg Co, for instance, in November cut its profit forecast for the year, saying that it had cut too many jobs at its factories and would need to boost spending to fix problems related to food safety. U.S. regulators in June found listeria at one of the company’s plants in Georgia that produces Keebler and Famous Amos cookies, and in 2010 Kellogg had to recall millions of boxes of cereal due to an unusual smell. “We did cut too many people in our facilities in the U.S. network,” acknowledged Chief Executive John Bryant in a conference call with investors. On a similar note, an executive from Schlumberger, the world’s largest oilfield services company, has concluded that trying to manufacture equipment far from its main centers in the United States and France was not the right move. “Some of our manufacturing has been seen as something that’s easily commoditized and exported to the low end,” said David Rowatt, Schlumberger’s research director for mechanical and materials science, at a recent MIT conference. “We have had in place an approach of being able to design in one place and produce anywhere in the world and what we have seen internally is that is a model that has not worked for us.” Schlumberger officials did not respond to request for comment on the specific problems it faced. Even if executives warm more to the idea of American manufacturing, a combination of factors - the perception that U.S. factories cannot compete with lower-cost rivals in emerging markets and the notion that manufacturing plants are simply cost centers - has soured the American public’s view of the sector. As a result, manufacturing executives say, they have a hard time finding young people with the skills needed to work in today’s highly automated plants. “Manufacturing has a negative perception and it’s a negative perception because of many years of saying, ‘It’s OK to be a service economy and manufacturing is all about brawn and not about brains,’” said Keith Nosbusch, CEO of Rockwell Automation Inc, a Milwaukee-based manufacturer of factory automation equipment, in an interview last month. “Obviously it’s something we worry about a lot.” Jason Miller, assistant to President Barack Obama on manufacturing policy, recently addressed an MIT summit about the U.S. government’s new plan to work with major manufacturers and top universities to educate young people on advanced manufacturing. “It’s not about some desire to return to a romantic notion of the past, of what manufacturing was,” Miller said. “It is about a fundamental recognition that without a robust and vibrant manufacturing sector, it’s going to be difficult for us to sustain a robust and innovative economy.” Proponents of manufacturing often point to the so-called multiplier effect of the jobs the sector employs. Each new manufacturing job created in the United States on average creates three more nonmanufacturing jobs - ranging from supplier jobs to restaurants and shops where factory workers spend their pay, according to a Boston Consulting Group study. Many U.S. manufacturing executives complain that U.S. high schools are not providing students with the technical and scientific training they need to work in modern factories. “We’re having a challenge increasingly finding capable people coming out of our secondary schools, with high school educations that have the capability to work in some of our operations,” Caterpillar group president Stuart Levenick said at the Reuters Global Manufacturing and Transportation Summit this week. “You think about manufacturing and a lot of people in this country think of it as an old, dirty, unsafe environment. And this is becoming a very high tech, world-class, highly paid job.” That view was echoed by Rolf Meyer, CEO of Harting USA, a privately held maker of electronic connectors. “Kids don’t have any kind of relationship to manufacturing anymore, so why should they become an engineer?” Meyer recalled hiring an engineer who was handy with computer-aided design but hopeless at building things. Meyer once had to take a screwdriver out of the worker’s hands. “I was afraid he’d kill himself,” he said. “The screwdriver had a very sharp tip. He had never used it.” ",12142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-manufacturing-respect/manufacturing-can-thrive-but-struggles-for-respect-idUSTRE7BD1WR20111214
86,PG,SEC probe adds to uncertainty on Diamond's Pringles deal,"(Reuters) - Diamond Foods Inc said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a probe into its accounting of payments to walnut growers, raising concerns of further delays to its deal to acquire Procter & Gamble’s Pringles business. Shares of the company, which sells Emerald nuts and Pop Secret popcorn, fell more than 11 percent to their lowest in two years Thursday on Nasdaq. The news prompted at least one analyst to downgrade the stock citing general uncertainty and increased risk that the deal may fall through. “Procter & Gamble indicated to us this morning that it would not be comfortable moving forward with the Pringles deal while the SEC investigation was ongoing,” Jefferies analyst Thilo Wrede wrote in a client note. The investigation will most likely keep Diamond’s stock depressed with an unclear end date for the SEC action and the probability of the acquisition closing now even less certain, the analyst said while cutting the stock from “buy to “hold.” The deal expires if it is not consummated by June 30, 2012. Wrede said P&G; was not willing to speculate if it would consider extending that deadline to allow the SEC to complete its investigation. When contacted by Reuters, a P&G; spokeswoman said: “Our commitment to the transaction is predicated on the favorable resolution of all these current investigations.” The probe centers on allegations that Diamond delayed payments to growers to lower costs in the company’s 2011 fiscal year ended July 31, in order to make its earnings look better while it was negotiating to buy Pringles. The company, which agreed to buy the snacks foods brand in April, has seen its stock lose more than half its value since it first announced an internal probe on the matter in November. However, the shares soared nearly 53 percent last Friday, after an analyst said the company would likely come out of its accounting examination quickly and without evidence of wrongdoing. The stock fell again Monday, after Diamond delayed filing its quarterly report to allow its audit committee time to complete the inquiry. [ID:nL1E7NC7NF] The internal probe had also forced Diamond to delay the closing of the Pringles acquisition until 2012. Diamond shares closed down 5.5 percent at $27.87.

The factory, which employs about 700 people in manufacturing as well as another 800 in design, engineering and management, is an anomaly in modern America - a manufacturing site in one of most expensive cities in the country. But to Gillette’s parent company, Procter & Gamble, Boston is an ideal base not only for making Fusion and Mach 3 razors, but to produce machines that assemble Gillette products around the world: After a century of making razors at the site, the company has a critical mass of experienced workers. “The guys in my world see the new products three to five years before anyone else,” said Ronald Calder, who runs the machine shop at the South Boston facility, which develops the equipment that produces many thousands of razors per day. Having his crew of machine makers a short walk from the people who manufacture the razors allows them to develop and fine-tune machines quickly and cheaply. That plays to what P&G; management regards as its strength. “Oftentimes, the basis for our competitive advantage in a category is the process or manufacturing operation that allows us to make better quality than our competitors at a lower cost,” said Bruce Brown, chief technology officer with the Cincinnati-based company. America’s debate over manufacturing has escalated in the face of stubbornly high unemployment and the realization that younger workers lack some of the basic skills necessary to hold down a job in an assembly plant or a fabrication shop. Gillette is facing that issue in part by putting interested factory workers through a technical training program at a nearby state university. One graduate of that program is Mike DiBella, 31, who started at the factory five years ago with a high school diploma and some vocational school experience. After the additional program, today he manages 14 machines that sharpen steel for blades. DiBella said he is never bored, enjoys the challenges of the job, and sees opportunities for growth. P&G; runs against the grain in corporate America in believing that the company’s manufacturing skill is a large part of the reason shoppers are willing to pay about $3.50 for a single Fusion razor cartridge. The company argues that manufacturing in-house and in Boston helps it to meet exacting standards for its razors, necessary since men would be less willing to pay premium prices if they cut themselves during their morning shaves. It is not just basic items like clothing and furniture that have migrated to offshore production. More complicated, and higher-tech products such as Apple Inc’s iPads and Nike Inc running shoes are largely made overseas, often in subcontracted factories not owned by the brands whose products they are making. Cheaper labor costs have been the main drivers of such production in China and elsewhere but with Chinese wage costs rising sharply, the yuan currency gaining against the U.S. dollar, and transport costs increasing, the advantage against the U.S. has narrowed a bit in recent years. Also the main downside of moving production to an outside contractor in a country like China is the danger of losing some control over quality and over intellectual property. Still, American manufacturing is now considered to be primarily the domain of makers of bigger-ticket, highly engineered products such as medical imaging devices and excavators, including General Electric Co, United Technologies Corp and Caterpillar Inc. And it’s not as if P&G; hasn’t weighed the options for the Boston site. When the company bought Gillette in 2005, it considered closing the 45-acre (18 hectare) facility. After deciding to keep it open, it then pulled the company’s white-collar staff out of the city’s iconic Prudential Tower and consolidated Boston operations onto the factory campus. Keeping both its manufacturing and the design of its machinery in-house makes it harder for rivals to knock off its designs, the company reasons. Mike Chaney, Gillette’s vice president of product supply, cites the line of Sensor razors, introduced in 1990 and no longer protected by patents, as an example. “Anyone could copy it, but they don’t because they don’t know how to make it efficiently,” said Chaney. The company has good reason to be protective of its razor business, as it is one of P&G;’s most profitable ventures. The company’s grooming division - which includes men’s razors, as well as other products including men’s deodorant but not women’s razors - notched a 20 percent profit margin in the fiscal year ended June 30, well above the company’s five other divisions, which make products ranging from Crest toothpaste to Pampers diapers. While a weak global economy and rising costs in emerging markets have led more companies to think like Proctor & Gamble, manufacturing experts say many executives have long looked at manufacturing operations too narrowly, focusing mainly on cost. Quick reductions to the cost of making a product, whether by moving production to a lower-cost region or handing it off entirely to another company, can provide a quick boost to profit margins but make it vulnerable to quality problems or theft of technology and designs. “They call it a cost center. It costs money rather than adds revenue,” said Jung-Hoon Chun, the director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Laboratory for Manufacturing and Productivity. “Because it’s a cost center, if you become a manager of the unit, if you get rid of that then from day one you get rid of costs.” That attitude has contributed to a slow decline in U.S. manufacturing employment. The sector currently employs about 12 million people in the United States, down from a peak of near 20 million around 1980. While many companies have reduced headcount due to productivity initiatives, cutting manufacturing too deeply can take its toll. The world’s largest cereal maker, Kellogg Co, for instance, in November cut its profit forecast for the year, saying that it had cut too many jobs at its factories and would need to boost spending to fix problems related to food safety. U.S. regulators in June found listeria at one of the company’s plants in Georgia that produces Keebler and Famous Amos cookies, and in 2010 Kellogg had to recall millions of boxes of cereal due to an unusual smell. “We did cut too many people in our facilities in the U.S. network,” acknowledged Chief Executive John Bryant in a conference call with investors. On a similar note, an executive from Schlumberger, the world’s largest oilfield services company, has concluded that trying to manufacture equipment far from its main centers in the United States and France was not the right move. “Some of our manufacturing has been seen as something that’s easily commoditized and exported to the low end,” said David Rowatt, Schlumberger’s research director for mechanical and materials science, at a recent MIT conference. “We have had in place an approach of being able to design in one place and produce anywhere in the world and what we have seen internally is that is a model that has not worked for us.” Schlumberger officials did not respond to request for comment on the specific problems it faced. Even if executives warm more to the idea of American manufacturing, a combination of factors - the perception that U.S. factories cannot compete with lower-cost rivals in emerging markets and the notion that manufacturing plants are simply cost centers - has soured the American public’s view of the sector. As a result, manufacturing executives say, they have a hard time finding young people with the skills needed to work in today’s highly automated plants. “Manufacturing has a negative perception and it’s a negative perception because of many years of saying, ‘It’s OK to be a service economy and manufacturing is all about brawn and not about brains,’” said Keith Nosbusch, CEO of Rockwell Automation Inc, a Milwaukee-based manufacturer of factory automation equipment, in an interview last month. “Obviously it’s something we worry about a lot.” Jason Miller, assistant to President Barack Obama on manufacturing policy, recently addressed an MIT summit about the U.S. government’s new plan to work with major manufacturers and top universities to educate young people on advanced manufacturing. “It’s not about some desire to return to a romantic notion of the past, of what manufacturing was,” Miller said. “It is about a fundamental recognition that without a robust and vibrant manufacturing sector, it’s going to be difficult for us to sustain a robust and innovative economy.” Proponents of manufacturing often point to the so-called multiplier effect of the jobs the sector employs. Each new manufacturing job created in the United States on average creates three more nonmanufacturing jobs - ranging from supplier jobs to restaurants and shops where factory workers spend their pay, according to a Boston Consulting Group study. Many U.S. manufacturing executives complain that U.S. high schools are not providing students with the technical and scientific training they need to work in modern factories. “We’re having a challenge increasingly finding capable people coming out of our secondary schools, with high school educations that have the capability to work in some of our operations,” Caterpillar group president Stuart Levenick said at the Reuters Global Manufacturing and Transportation Summit this week. “You think about manufacturing and a lot of people in this country think of it as an old, dirty, unsafe environment. And this is becoming a very high tech, world-class, highly paid job.” That view was echoed by Rolf Meyer, CEO of Harting USA, a privately held maker of electronic connectors. “Kids don’t have any kind of relationship to manufacturing anymore, so why should they become an engineer?” Meyer recalled hiring an engineer who was handy with computer-aided design but hopeless at building things. Meyer once had to take a screwdriver out of the worker’s hands. “I was afraid he’d kill himself,” he said. “The screwdriver had a very sharp tip. He had never used it.” ",12152011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-manufacturing-respect/manufacturing-can-thrive-but-struggles-for-respect-idUSTRE7BD1WR20111215
89,PG,Procter & Gamble confirms hiring freeze for fiscal year,"NEW YORK, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co , the world’s largest maker of household products, has halted full-time hiring for this fiscal year, a company spokeswoman said, confirming an earlier report. “We have generally met our hiring goals for this fiscal year and therefore we are not currently recruiting and hiring,” the spokeswoman said in an email. “We always recruit according to the needs of the business, and we will resume active recruiting based on the needs of the business.” In November, the maker of Pampers diapers and Tide detergent said it had raised its full-year profit outlook to reflect gains from the $1.5 billion sale of its Pringles snacks business. The company also said it had started implementing its previously announced restructuring plans. The Financial Times Deutschland reported earlier on Sunday the news of the hiring freeze.

90,PG,Judge unlikely to toss Gupta insider trial tapes,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York federal judge on Thursday damped hopes that he would throw out government wire tap evidence in the insider trading trial of Rajat Gupta, a former board member of Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Procter & Gamble (PG.N). Gupta, a one-time global head of the McKinsey & Co consultancy firm, is the most prominent corporate executive charged in the U.S. government’s investigation of Wall Street insider trading, a probe that used secretly recorded phone conversations as evidence. Dozens of hedge fund managers, lawyers and executives have been convicted since 2009 in the sweeping prosecution. Gupta, 63, was indicted in October and is scheduled to go on trial in Manhattan federal court in April on charges that in 2008 and 2009 he passed on secrets from Goldman and P&G; board meetings to hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam, a friend and business associate who traded on the information. Rajaratnam is serving an 11-year prison sentence following his conviction by a jury in May on evidence largely based on phone taps. Government investigators recorded at least two discussions between Rajaratnam and Gupta. The former board member’s lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff to suppress the recordings from being heard by a jury, even though the judge in the Rajaratnam trial had allowed them to be used. “This is a different defendant and he may be entitled to be heard on this issue but looking at it realistically, if I were the defense I would not be too optimistic about this particular motion,” Rakoff said at a pre-trial hearing on Thursday. Gupta’s main lawyer, Gary Naftalis, declined comment after the hearing, where Gupta sat expressionless with his team of lawyers. Gupta has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and Naftalis has previously said that the accusations are based on circumstantial evidence. In court on Thursday, Naftalis described the indictment as “vague and mumbo-jumbo” and an “unusual insider trading case.” He said Gupta “didn’t trade, didn’t profit and there were no kickbacks.” Naftalis had filed motions on Tuesday seeking to suppress the wiretaps and dismiss some charges in the indictment. He also asked the government for more specificity of the charges. A U.S. prosecutor, Richard Tarlowe, told the judge that the government may file a revised indictment by the end of January that would spell out how Gupta benefited from his association with Rajaratnam. The government contends that Gupta provided Rajaratnam with advance knowledge of Warren Buffett’s $5 billion investment in Goldman at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, as well as information about Goldman’s surprise fourth-quarter loss in 2008 and P&G;’s quarterly earnings in late January 2009. Gupta was also accused of telling Rajaratnam in June 2008 about the sale of P&G;’s Folgers coffee unit to J.M. Smucker Co (SJM.N). The case is USA v Gupta, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 11-907.

91,PG,Diamond Foods hit with criminal inquiry: report,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors have launched a criminal inquiry into Diamond Foods Inc’s DMND.O walnut payments, an action that could throw its pending purchase of Pringles from Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) into doubt, the Wall Street Journal reported. The snack maker’s accounting of payments to walnut growers is already subject to an internal company investigation and a probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Those investigations center on allegations that Diamond delayed payments to farmers to make its earnings for the fiscal year ended July 31 look better while it negotiated to buy Pringles from Procter & Gamble (PG.N). The seller of Emerald nuts, Kettle potato chips and Pop Secret popcorn had agreed to buy the Pringles snack food brand in April. The two companies have since delayed the acquisition due to the investigation. Representatives from Diamond and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in San Francisco were not immediately available for comment.

92,PG,P&G; gears up for London debut,"LONDON (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest household products maker, plans to sponsor more than 150 athletes at the London Olympics this summer after joining the top tier of Games backers. P&G; is seeking to build on the momentum created by its sponsorship of the U.S. team at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, which it said generated an additional $100 million in sales. Later that year it became the newest addition to the International Olympic Committee’s roster of 11 leading sponsors who help to fund the Games and in return get exclusive worldwide marketing rights to the event. “We found this was good for business but most importantly good for our brands, touching a lot of different people,” Marc Pritchard, P&G; Global Marketing and Brand Building Officer, told Reuters. “We had 16 brands in Vancouver. We’ll have more than 30 brands participating in London,” he said in a telephone interview from Cincinnati, Ohio, where P&G; has its headquarters. “We had 18 athletes in Vancouver. We’re going to have more than 150 athletes that we sponsor in London,” he said. P&G;, whose brands include Duracell and Gillette, signed up in 2010 for a 10-year deal to sponsor the next five summer and winter Olympics, starting in London. After London, the Games will head to the fast-developing markets of Russia, Brazil and South Korea. The 2020 venue is yet to be awarded. Sponsors typically pay around $100 million for each package of summer and winter Olympics. Fast food chain McDonald’s last week became the seventh major sponsor to sign a deal taking it through to the 2020 Olympics. Unlike other sponsors such as McDonald’s and Coca-Cola, P&G; has multiple brands to advertise. It is still completing its line-up of athletes for London, but has already done deals with some household names. Olympic swimming champion Michael Phelps, who has won a record 14 gold medals, will advertise P&G;’s “Head & Shoulders” shampoo. British medal hopes Jessica Ennis, a heptathlon champion, and Paula Radcliffe, a marathon world record holder, have also signed endorsement deals. The company is extending its “Thank You Mom” advertising campaign for this year’s Olympics, underlining the importance of maternal support for budding athletes. As part of that program, it has pledged to raise $5 million to support youth sports around the globe. Pritchard saw great scope for the use of digital media in brand campaigns around the Games - with sites like Facebook and Twitter having taken off since the Beijing Games in 2008. “You will definitely see a lot of activities that will be coming on Facebook and Google and Yahoo and Microsoft, the whole gamut,” he said. “We see this is going to be a very, very digital Games.” ",1172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-pg/pg-gears-up-for-london-debut-idUSTRE80G24Y20120117

94,PG,Procter & Gamble lowers forecast due to strong dollar,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co cut its full-year profit forecast because of the strong dollar, and its quarterly profit plunged 49 percent as the world’s largest household products maker wrote down the value of its appliance and salon professional products businesses. The maker of Tide detergent said it had not seen competitors match some of the price increases it imposed to mitigate higher commodity costs. That made P&G;’s products less attractive to shoppers focused on prices rather than brands and indicates the competition among household product makers shows no signs of abating. Cincinnati-based P&G; also said it is cutting about 1,600 corporate positions by the end of June, a move that should save it about $240 million a year before taxes. The cuts represent 1.2 percent of its total workforce of 129,000. P&G; is also cutting the number of technical centers it has and outsourcing some of the work it does in U.S. stores. Excluding one-time charges, core earnings per share fell 3 percent to $1.10 as sales growth and cost cuts were not enough to offset double-digit increases in commodity costs. The profit topped analysts’ average forecast of $1.08 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. While the profit beat expectations, some analysts said the quality of the report was disappointing. P&G; shares were down 0.6 percent at $64.42 in morning trading, compared with a 0.45 percent dip in the Dow Jones industrial average, of which it is a component. When fiscal 2012 began last July, P&G; expected foreign exchange to add 2 percent to 3 percent to net sales, Chief Executive Officer Bob McDonald said. Now, as the dollar has strengthened against currencies such as the ruble, zloty, real and peso, P&G; expects the impact of currency rates to cut net sales by 1 percent this year, and it cut its fiscal-year profit forecast. For the fiscal year ending in June, P&G; now expects to earn $4.00 to $4.10 per share, down from a prior forecast of $4.15 to $4.33. Analysts had been expecting $4.17. “While we are obviously not happy with the guidance cut, it is not completely unexpected, either, given the F/X environment,” said Oppenheimer analyst Joseph Altobello. The lower forecast comes the day after smaller rival Colgate-Palmolive Co said the stronger dollar could shave 4 percentage points from its earnings growth. P&G; often leads the industry in price increases, and competitors held off on matching some of its recent hikes. In the United Kingdom, P&G;’s average retail price for laundry products is up 4 percent over the last six months, while those from competitor Unilever are down about 5 percent, McDonald said. The U.S. price of P&G;’s Tide powder detergent is up at a double-digit percentage rate from a year ago, while lower-priced competitor Church & Dwight Co Inc cut its prices in a low-single-digit range, he said. P&G; is responding by rescinding a small number of its price hikes. In August, it raised the U.S. price of its Cascade dishwasher detergent by an average of 8 percent. After its market share in that business fell more than 7 points, it will revert back to its earlier pricing starting next month. P&G; narrowed its 2012 organic sales forecast, calling for a rise of 4 percent to 5 percent, compared with prior expectations for 3 percent to 6 percent. Organic sales strip out the impact of acquisitions, asset sales and currency fluctuations. P&G; earned $1.69 billion, or 57 cents per share, in the second quarter ended in December, down from $3.33 billion, or $1.11 per share, a year earlier. Much of the decline stemmed from writing off the value of the appliance and salon professional products businesses. The company suggested in its 2011 annual report that it might take such a step. While P&G; still thinks the businesses are attractive and remains committed to them, it wrote down their value due to their exposure to the tough Western European market, their discretionary nature, and increased competition, executives said. P&G;’s quarterly sales rose 4 percent to $22.14 billion. Organic sales rose in each business unit and were up 4 percent overall. The volume of goods sold rose 1 percent, with growth in developing markets offsetting a decline in developed regions. For the current third quarter, P&G; forecast core earnings of 91 cents to 97 cents per share, compared with 96 cents a year earlier. It expects organic sales to rise 3 percent to 5 percent. P&G;’s plan to sell its Pringles business to Diamond Foods Inc is on hold as Diamond investigates its payments to walnut growers. The snack foods company is expected to give an update on the issue by mid-February.

95,PG,P&G; resumes deliveries to insolvent Schlecker,"* Schlecker assumes all suppliers to restart deliveries soon * Insolvency administrator in talks with suppliers * Rossmann founder says Schlecker landlords want out FRANKFURT, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble  has resumed deliveries to Schlecker, which will help restock shelves five days after Germany’s biggest drugstore chain filed for insolvency. “Schlecker assumes that the remaining business and industry partners will resume normal cooperation again shortly,” the company said in a statement on Friday. Schlecker is seeking protection from its creditors, putting about 30,000 jobs at risk, as struggling European businesses find it increasingly hard to secure funds against a gloomy economic backdrop. A number of suppliers stopped deliveries to Schlecker following the insolvency filing, including P&G;, the maker of Pampers diapers and Gillette razors, and Unilever  , which makes Dove body care products and Rexona deodorants. Other big suppliers to Schlecker are Beiersdorf, the German maker of Nivea skin cream, and Henkel, whose brands include Persil in Germany, Schwarzkopf hair products and Pritt stick glue. A court-appointed insolvency administrator, Arndt Geiwitz, has been negotiating with creditors and suppliers and crossed the biggest hurdle, an agreement with Schlecker’s biggest creditor Markant, on Wednesday. Schlecker’s landlords were also trying to safeguard their investments and have approached rival drugstore chain Rossmann. “Many landlords have approached me. A few hundred have offered me their stores,” founder Dirk Rossmann told Reuters on Friday, adding he would not make a move on any of the outlets until he has spoken with administrator Geiwitz. Rossmann said he expects Schlecker, which last year announced plans to shut 700 to 1,000 stores, to drop back to Germany’s No.3 drugstore chain this year with about 5 billion euros ($6.58 billion) in sales. He expects his chain to post 5.6 billion euros in sales, making it second to dm with 6.7 billion euros.",1272012,http://www.reuters.com/article/schlecker-proctergamble/pg-resumes-deliveries-to-insolvent-schlecker-idUSL5E8CR2V920120127

97,PG,"UPDATE 4-Diamond removes CEO, CFO after nut payment probe","* CEO Michael Mendes replaced by director Rick Wolford * To restate results for 2010, 2011 * P&G; says Diamond news “disappointing” * Shares fall 40 pct after hours By Mihir Dalal Feb 8 (Reuters) - Diamond Foods Inc   removed top management after its audit committee found that the company improperly accounted for payments to walnut growers, sending its shares down 40 percent in after-hours trading. The company, maker of Emerald nuts, Kettle chips and Pop Secret popcorn, also said that earnings for its 2010 and 2011 fiscal years will need to be restated to account for the payments. The result of the probe has thrown into doubt the company’s deal to buy the Pringles potato chip business from Procter & Gamble Co.. Chief Executive Michael Mendes and Chief Financial Officer Steve Neil have been placed on administrative leave, the company said in a statement, adding that it was seeking permanent replacements for the two men. Diamond named director Rick Wolford as acting chief executive and Michael Murphy of consulting firm Alix Partners as acting finance chief. The company is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over the accounting. In addition, the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. prosecutors have launched a criminal inquiry. The announcement Wednesday is the latest shock to Diamond investors since the probe over payments was announced in November. Adding to the cloud over the company was the suicide that month of Diamond board member Joseph Silveira, who was on the audit committee but recused himself from the probe since he was president of a firm that manages walnut-growing properties. Diamond’s audit committee found that a payment of about $20 million to walnut growers in August 2010 and another amount of about $60 million in September 2011 were not booked in the correct periods, the company said. Additional information could be discovered as part of the audit committee’s ongoing investigation or as the financial restatements are prepared, the company said in a filing with the SEC. The company has been besieged with questions about whether the way the payments were booked was intended to make the company look better while it negotiated to buy Pringles from P&G.; A spokesman for P&G; said the Diamond announcement was “breaking news” to the company and that it was considering what steps to take next. “The information released by Diamond Foods is very disappointing,” P&G; spokesman Paul Fox said. “Pringles remains a valuable asset and it has attracted considerable interest from other outside parties.” “We need to be focused on building Pringles and on its employees.” Those employees would move to Diamond under terms of the deal. One food and beverage industry consultant said he did not expect the Pringles deal to survive. “There’s always a chance, but I would think that the Pringles deal is dead,” said Tom Pirko, CEO of Bevmark Consulting. Pirko said he expects it to take some time for Diamond — whose shares have fallen nearly 80 percent since hitting a high of $96.13 in September — to recover from the probe. “Essentially what has happened is a kind of surgery to excise a tumor,” Pirko said. “The company has lost faith with investors. They’re going to have to make wholesale changes to their culture, their business practices, their accounts, their communications.” Mendes, whose removal is a fall from grace, joined Diamond in 1991 and quickly rose through the ranks to become CEO in 1997. He transformed the company from a co-operative of walnut growers into one of the biggest snack food companies in the United States. After the company went public in 2005, Mendes spent millions on popular brands like Pop Secret popcorn and Kettle chips, and moved the company’s headquarters from its rural base in Stockton, California, to San Francisco. Neil, a veteran finance professional, had been CFO since early 2008. He previously held the top finance jobs at lens makers Cooper Cos Inc and Ocular Sciences, and at the generic drugs company Perrigo Co.

98,PG,Kellogg to buy Pringles for $2.7 billion,"(Reuters) - Kellogg Co (K.N) agreed to buy Pringles potato chips for $2.7 billion in a cash deal that makes the cereal company second only to PepsiCo Inc PEP.N in the global snack food market. The transaction also marks the final exit of household products maker Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) from the food business after its earlier deal to sell Pringles to Diamond Foods Inc DMND.O fell apart. The deal was gobbled up on Wall Street. Shares of Kellogg, whose snack brands already include Keebler cookies, Cheez-It crackers and Kashi snack bars, rose as much as 6 percent to their highest since early November, when the company posted disappointing results and cut its 2011 earnings outlook. Adding Pringles will nearly triple the size of Kellogg’s international snack business, pushing snacks to a point where they will account for as much of total revenue as Kellogg’s well-known cereal business - the world’s largest, with brands such as Special K and Rice Krispies. Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo said the diversification is good since the cereal business is highly competitive between Kellogg, General Mills Inc (GIS.N) and private label brands. “It’s a win-win,” Russo said. “It gets Procter more focused on where they need to be and it’s additive to Kellogg’s earnings.” Pringles, whose products are sold in over 100 countries, has suffered from being on the block for nearly a year, Russo said. Still, it is a good brand with a strong international distribution network that will likely boost the sales of Kellogg’s existing products, he added. P&G; had agreed to sell Pringles to Diamond Foods last April, for $1.5 billion in cash. With $850 million of debt, the enterprise value was $2.35 billion on that deal, which was structured in a way that let P&G; save on a hefty capital gains tax. But that deal became “no longer feasible,” according to P&G; Chief Executive Bob McDonald, following the discovery of improper accounting at Diamond that led the snacks company to replace its chief executive and finance chief. The U.S. government is looking into Diamond’s accounting practices. The new deal, worth $2.7 billion, is structured differently. On a conference call, Credit Suisse analyst Robert Moskow estimated that there could be $490 million of tax benefits for Kellogg, which means it is paying closer to $2.2 billion. Even though the new deal is “modestly less attractive” than the Diamond deal, Oppenheimer analyst Joseph Altobello said it improves P&G;’s profile since it removes a non-core brand. Diamond said on Wednesday that it does not have to pay any break-up fee on the aborted Pringles deal and its shares rose more than 5 percent. With Diamond’s future unknown, some analysts have begun to assess the attractiveness of its snack food brands, Kettle potato chips and Pop Secret popcorn, to another buyer. In an interview with Reuters, Kellogg Chief Executive John Bryant declined to comment on his company’s interest in Diamond or any of its brands. He did admit, however, that Diamond’s brands made more strategic sense to Kellogg now that it is poised to become the world’s second-largest savory snack company behind PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay, which owns four out of the top five snack brands in the world: Lay’s, Doritos, Cheetos and Ruffles. “They’re clearly a fit in the portfolio. You could say our ability to do bolt-on acquisitions has probably expanded with the addition of this business,” Bryant said. Pringles is the fourth-largest brand of snacks in the world, with 2.3 percent of the market, according to Euromonitor International. In the United States, it ranks eighth with 2.5 percent. The companies expect the deal to close by this summer. Both companies declined to say when their discussions started. But when an analyst asked Kellogg’s Bryant why his company did not buy Pringles when it was up for sale last year, he said it was hard to compete with the Diamond offer. Also, Kellogg is now more interested in growing its international snack business than it had been, he added. While Pringles was a revenue-driver for P&G;, bringing in about $1.5 billion a year in sales, it was the company’s only remaining food business and no longer fit in with P&G;’s focus on items such as beauty and personal care products. In recent years, P&G; also sold off its Folgers coffee business and Jif peanut butter. In contrast, Pringles will be “center plate” for Kellogg, Bryant said, meaning that Kellogg could put more focus on Pringles than P&G; had. P&G; said the deal would lead to an after-tax gain of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, or 47 to 50 cents per share, about the same amount it estimated when it first announced the agreement with Diamond in April 2011. About 1,700 P&G; employees will move to Kellogg. Kellogg will borrow $2 billion to complete the deal and expects to limit its share repurchase program for about two years. Excluding one-time costs and the impact of reduced buybacks, the deal will add 8 to 10 cents per share to Kellogg’s earnings in 2012 and 22 to 25 cents in 2013, Kellogg said. Including those items, the deal will lower Kellogg’s earnings per share in 2012 by 11 to 16 cents. P&G; said that, should the deal be completed this fiscal year ending in June, it would earn about $3.77 to $3.93 per share, including the one-time gain from the deal. Kellogg shares closed up 5.1 percent at $52.87 on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as high as $53.35. P&G; shares closed up 0.1 percent at $64.55. Diamond shares closed up 5.2 percent at $23.46 on the Nasdaq. Barclays Capital was Kellogg’s financial advisor, while Morgan Stanley advised Procter & Gamble.

99,PG,UPDATE 1-P&G; ready for big innovation after Tide Pods delay,"* P&G;’s Tide Pods launch is later, smaller than planned * Aiming for $300 mln in sales in first year * Sees individual dose units up to 35 pct of laundry in 5-10 yrs By Jessica Wohl CINCINNATI, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co  regrets the long-delayed debut of its new Tide Pods detergent and intends to introduce more new products and brands that can shake up the market, its chief executive said on Wednesday. CEO Bob McDonald would like to see the world’s largest household products maker have more of what he calls “discontinuous innovation,” creating new categories, new brands and new technology to use across the entire company, he told a group of reporters at a P&G; event in Cincinnati. P&G; is hailing Tide Pods as its biggest product innovation of 2012, despite a variety of setbacks and limited marketing support. Tide Pods — a single-dose, dissolvable packet of detergent, stain fighters and brighteners — were expected on store shelves in August 2011, but are just now appearing at retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Although stores are receiving the product now, there are no plans for big, separate displays that typically accompany a launch in the household products industry. “While we do take responsibility” for the delay of Tide Pods and “we regret it,” the company introduces about 27 big, new items each year, he said. “We want to do better, we will do better, we didn’t do as well as we would like on Pods.” Getting it right with Tide is important for P&G;’s reputation. Tide was the company’s first brand to surpass $1 billion in annual sales in the late 1980s and McDonald, CEO since July 2009, and A.G. Lafley, his CEO predecessor, are among the executives to have worked on the brand. “Innovation has never been more critical,” Bruce Brown, chief research and development officer, told reporters at P&G;’s  commercial innovation center outside of Cincinnati. It took P&G; eight years of research, with 75 technical staff working on the project full-time, to come up with Tide Pods. More than 6,000 consumers have been involved in testing, he said. The company calls it the brand’s biggest innovation since Liquid Tide’s 1984 launch. P&G; said that Tide Pods were delayed first because demand from retailers was so strong, and then because it was unable to ramp up production at a plant in Louisiana quickly enough to meet such demand. Analysts were surprised by the delays, as P&G; is renowned for spending more than $2 billion a year on research and development and more than four times that amount on advertising. “It is unclear what happened to the P&G; that ‘painted purple’ U.S. stores when it launched Prilosec,” Consumer Edge Research analyst Javier Escalante said, referring to that product’s package color and strong in-store marketing support. P&G; is ready with product giveaways, a commercial that will debut during the Feb. 26 Academy Awards and print and outdoor advertising, but is not using big in-store displays for now. BMO Capital Markets analyst Connie Maneaty trimmed her fiscal 2012 profit expectations, including a reduction of 5 cents per share tied to the delay of the Tide Pods launch, even before the company issued second-quarter results last month. It is not the first time in recent memory that a P&G; product launch has had hiccups. Others included the glitch in 2011 when Gillette could not make enough Fusion ProGlide razors. Tide Pods are priced at a premium to traditional powder detergent, which may make it tough to entice shoppers. The pricing is more on par with Tide liquid detergents that have added benefits, such as Tide with Febreze, McDonald said. While P&G; delayed its product launch to get production       levels right, competitors have muscled in. Church & Dwight Co Inc is already selling its Arm & Hammer Power Paks single-use laundry detergent, Unilever’s All has a single-dose product and so does Henkel’s Purex. “I welcome competition,” said Alex Keith, P&G;’s general manager of North American fabric care. The packet concept has not yet caught on with consumers in the United States. Liquid detergent is the leader, making up about 70 percent to 80 percent of U.S. sales, followed by powder, she said. Detergents of all kinds, including those from competitors, line the shelves of grocery stores reproduced at the P&G; innovation center. P&G; uses the stores, along with other test areas at the discreet building outside Cincinnati, to do research with retailers, shoppers, suppliers and others. Tide Pods should hit $300 million in sales in their first year, and individual dose detergents in general — including competitors — should account for 30 percent to 35 percent of the market in the next five to 10 years, P&G;’s Keith said. Ian Bell, head of home care and tissue and hygiene research at Euromonitor International, said that he would “very surprised” if the pod category could get over 12 percent to 15 percent of the U.S. market in terms of value sales in the next five years.",2152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/procter-tide/update-1-pg-ready-for-big-innovation-after-tide-pods-delay-idUSL2E8DFEPY20120215

The transaction will also let household goods maker P&G; finally leave the food business after its agreement with Diamond Foods Inc fell apart. Shares of Kellogg, which is aiming to expand a snack portfolio that already includes Keebler cookies, Cheez-It crackers and Kashi snack bars, rose 6 percent in  Wednesday morning trading.

You could say our ability to do bolt-on acquisitions has probably expanded with the addition of this business,” Bryant said. Plus, Pringles’ existing international distribution network can help lift sales of Kellogg’s other brands, said Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard. “We believe that Kellogg will be able to generate meaningful revenue synergies, particularly in complementary regions where Pringles is relatively strong but Kellogg is weak, most notably Asia,” Howard wrote in a research note. The companies expect the deal to close by this summer. Both companies declined to say when their discussions started.

103,PG,P&G; to cut about 10 percent of non-manufacturing jobs,"BOCA RATON, Florida (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co plans to cut a total of 5,700 nonmanufacturing jobs as part of a new plan to reduce costs by $10 billion by the end of fiscal 2016, Chief Executive Officer Bob McDonald said on Thursday. The world’s largest household products company has about 57,000 non-manufacturing employees among its total workforce of about 129,000. P&G; had already said it would cut 1,600 positions in the current fiscal year. On Thursday, it said it would cut another 4,100 jobs during fiscal 2013, which begins in July.

110,PG,US adds new insider trading allegation against ex-Goldman director,"NEW YORK, April 16 (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have added a new insider trading allegation against Rajat Gupta, a former director of Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Procter & Gamble Co charged with illegally tipping his former friend Raj Rajaratnam, the convicted founder of Galleon Group hedge fund. Prosecutors said in a letter to U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff made public on Monday that Gupta tipped Rajaratnam “relating to P&G;’s organic sales growth forecast for the October-December quarter prior to P&G;’s public announcement on or about Dec. 11, 2008.” They said this allegation was based on information received on April 5 in Galleon documents. Gupta was indicted in October and he is the highest-ranking executive charged in a broad U.S. crackdown on insider trading at hedge funds. He is charged with five counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy. He could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted of securities fraud. He has denied all charges against him, and is scheduled to go on trial on May 21. Rajaratnam is serving an 11-year prison sentence after being convicted by a jury at trial last year on evidence largely based on unprecedented wiretaps. Prosecutors may not add allegations unless new information comes to light. In their letter, which is dated April 9 and filed in Manhattan federal court, prosecutors suggested that more allegations against Gupta might be forthcoming. “The government ... is waiting for outstanding requests for information from a number of third-parties,” the letter said. “For example, the government is waiting for information relating to P&G;’s public announcement of its earnings on or about Jan. 31, 2008.” Gupta, a former head of the McKinsey & Co, is accused of providing inside tips about Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble board meetings to Rajaratnam in 2007 and 2008. In a statement, his lawyers said that “newly added charges — like the ones brought last year — are not based on any direct evidence, but rely on supposed circumstantial evidence.” Prosecutors previously said Gupta participated from Galleon’s offices in a Goldman conference call in March 2007, which discussed better-than-expected quarterly results that had yet to be released. Rajaratnam bought Goldman stock 25 minutes after the call ended, prosecutors said. Investigators recorded at least two discussions between Rajaratnam and Gupta. The indictment said Gupta gave Rajaratnam advance knowledge of a $5 billion investment in Goldman by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc  at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, Goldman’s surprise fourth-quarter 2008 loss, and P&G;’s quarterly earnings in late January 2009.

111,PG,"UPDATE 4-Weak developed markets, pricing woes hurt P&G;","* Q3 core EPS $0.94 vs Wall St view $0.93 * Full-year forecast cut on pricing issues, commodity costs * Shares down 3.2 pct at $64.75 By Jessica Wohl April 27 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co cut its full-year profit outlook, citing weakness in developed markets and said it would need to roll back some price increases, frustrating investors who wanted faster results from its business overhaul. The world’s largest household products maker, whose shares fell more than 3 percent on Friday, has been underperforming rivals such as Unilever  and Colgate-Palmolive Co. In February, it announced a restructuring plan to cut 5,700 nonmanufacturing jobs and $10 billion in costs by the end of fiscal 2016. P&G;, which makes Pampers diapers and Gillette razors, said on Friday it continues to feel the pinch of higher costs for commodities, such as diesel fuel, alcohol and chemicals. And in Venezuela, where P&G; sales are worth an annual $1 billion, new regulations forced the company to cut prices by as much as 25 percent, according to Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller. Venezuela froze prices on 19 key goods in December in an attempt to combat inflation. “Where is the taking responsibility for the weak numbers, as opposed to saying ‘not our fault, it’s just really tough out there’?” Citigroup analyst Wendy Nicholson said on a conference call with senior management. P&G; Chief Executive Bob McDonald said that as CEO, he took responsibility. But the admission didn’t satisfy analysts. “How long do you expect investors to wait? How long does your current plan have to work? How much patience does the board have?” asked Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj. P&G; said earnings fell to $2.41 billion, or 82 cents per share, in its fiscal third quarter through March, from $2.87 billion, or 96 cents per share, a year earlier. Core earnings per share, which excludes items such as restructuring charges, were flat at 94 cents, a penny above the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales grew 2 percent to $20.19 billion, a tad below the average Wall Street forecast of $20.29 billion. The results came a day after Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever beat market expectations with an 8.4 percent rise in first-quarter sales, sending its shares up 3 percent.  Colgate-Palmolive Co’s quarterly sales rose 5.2 percent, also slightly better than anticipated. McDonald, who became P&G;’s CEO in July 2009, said the company has not innovated enough in certain areas, particularly beauty care in the United States. More broadly, he blamed flat volume growth in the categories where P&G; competes. “The CEOs I talk to basically say that they see a decelerating trend,” McDonald told reporters. Much of the growth in developed markets “will be share growth, because the markets aren’t growing,” he said. P&G;, like many other household products makers, has raised prices to mitigate the impact of higher commodity costs. It rolled out $3.5 billion worth of price increases this year, but about $100 million to $200 million of them didn’t stick as competitors didn’t match them, CFO Moeller said on the call. Now P&G; is rescinding some of the increases, either by lowering prices, or keeping them unchanged while increasing the size of the products. The rollbacks are coming in laundry detergent in the United States, Britain and Mexico, and North American oral care, dishwasher detergent, and blades and razors. P&G; said it now expects core earnings per share of $3.82 to $3.88 this year, on sales growth of 4 percent. Back in February, it had forecast $3.93 to $4.03 for the year ending in June. Analysts were expecting full-year profit of $3.96 per share. P&G; expects to earn 79 cents to 85 cents per share in the current quarter. It forecasts 1 percent to 2 percent sales growth and said organic sales, which strip out the impact of deals and currency, should rise 4 percent to 5 percent.

112,PG,"Weak developed markets, pricing woes hurt P&G;","(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co cut its profit outlook for the year on Friday as weakness in developed markets, more attractive pricing by competitors, and the need to slash prices in Venezuela pressured margins as it overhauled its business.

The relocation, which is expected to take two years, comes as P&G; wants to run the business out of Asia where it sees the biggest growth opportunity. It was announced less than three months after P&G; unveiled a restructuring plan aimed at saving $10 billion and helping the world’s largest household products maker expand faster in emerging markets. Cincinnati-based P&G;’s brands include CoverGirl makeup, Olay and SK-II skin-care products and Secret deodorant. Virginia Drosos, 49, chose to retire rather than uproot her family, which includes two teenagers, according to a P&G; spokesman. Drosos has been with P&G; since 1987. Deb Henretta, group president of P&G;’s Asia and global specialty channel, will take over as group president of global skin care, cosmetics and personal care. Henretta, 51, joined P&G; in 1985. The change is expected to affect no more than 20 positions. Henretta’s current position will be filled by Hatsunori Kiriyama, P&G;’s vice president of Japan, marking the first time P&G; has had an Asian leader as president of Asia. He will be responsible for all of Asia except Greater China, which will continue to be run by Shannan Stevenson. Kiriyama will take over as president of Asia July 1, Henretta will take on her new role on Aug. 1, and Drosos will retire on Sept. 1, P&G; said.

115,PG,US judge inclined to allow 3 key calls at Gupta trial,"NEW YORK, May 16 (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors in the insider trading trial of former Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble board member Rajat Gupta won a judge’s tentative approval on Wednesday to present three telephone call recordings between his onetime friend and convicted hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam and two traders. Gupta, the most prominent corporate figure indicted in a U.S. government crackdown on insider trading at hedge funds in recent years, goes on trial on Monday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan charged with being in a conspiracy with Rajaratnam. The Galleon Group hedge fund founder was convicted a year ago on evidence largely based on court-approved wiretaps of his phones. In making a pre-trial ruling on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff emphasized it was not final. Rakoff said the three calls in September and October 2008 “are admissible subject to connection in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy between Mr. Gupta and Mr Rajaratnam.” The judge said the government runs the risk that, if the connection is not made, there is potential for a mistrial. During the trial, Gupta’s lawyers have the right to ask the judge to exclude government evidence. Federal prosecutors accuse the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc and McKinsey & Co global head of giving Rajaratnam information from Goldman and Procter & Gamble Co board meetings in 2007 and 2008. In addition to sitting on the Goldman board, Gupta also was a director at P&G.; Gupta denies the charges. The three phone calls the government wants admitted at trial were between Rajaratnam and two of his employees in which he makes references to receiving tips about Goldman. There are no recordings of phone conversations between Gupta and Rajaratnam on the dates at issue - Sept. 23 and on Oct. 23, 2008. Gupta’s lawyers argue that the evidence against him is circumstantial. Main defense lawyer Gary Naftalis argued that toll records show brief phone connections between the men. “There may not even have been a conversation,” Naftalis said in court on Wednesday. “We are dealing with speculation upon speculation here.” Gupta, 63, is charged with five counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy. He says he lost money investing with Rajaratnam and that as many as four other Goldman personnel could have tipped off Galleon. Gupta could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted. Rajaratnam, 53, is serving an 11-year prison sentence, the longest handed down in an insider-trading case in the United States. Prosecutors say Gupta gave Rajaratnam advance knowledge of a $5 billion investment in Goldman by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc  at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, Goldman’s surprise fourth-quarter 2008 loss, and P&G;’s quarterly earnings in late January 2009.

Blankfein, who runs Goldman, and Buffett, who runs Berkshire Hathaway Inc , are among dozens of people that lawyers for the government and for Gupta said on Thursday might be mentioned or might testify at the trial, which is expected to last about three weeks.

Gupta, the former chief of consulting firm McKinsey & Co, is the most prominent corporate executive charged in a government crackdown on insider trading centered on hedge funds. He was charged last October with leaking confidential information to his onetime friend, Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam, while serving on the Goldman and P&G; boards in 2007 and 2008. Gupta, 63, denies the charges, and has pleaded not guilty to five counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy. If convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison. His main lawyer, Gary Naftalis argues that the government’s case is circumstantial and speculative. Blankfein testified for the government at last year’s high profile trial of Rajaratnam, saying that disclosure of boardroom talks by Gupta violated Goldman’s confidentiality policies. He spoke after jurors heard a wiretapped recording in which Gupta and Rajaratnam discussed Goldman’s possibly buying a bank or insurer.

118,PG,UPDATE 2-Pursuit Dynamics loses out on key P&G; deal,"* Expects FY revenue to be “materially below” earlier view * Says to speed up ongoing strategic review of business * Expects to give an update on the review by the end of June * Loss of deal seen as “significant blow” By Abhishek Takle May 21 (Reuters) - Struggling British process technology company Pursuit Dynamics has lost out on a potential contract with Procter & Gamble and is to accelerate cost cuts as a result, news that wiped out three quarters of its market value on Monday. The loss-making company won extra funds from its shareholders in March. It said at the time that it was spending about 1 million pounds per month and that cash balances stood at 9.8 million pounds. It was hoping to turn cash flow positive by September and deliver sales of at least 22 million pounds ($35 million) up from less than 0.5 million pounds a year earlier. “The loss of Procter & Gamble today is a significant blow for them,” Paul Kavanagh, chairman at brokerage Killick Capital said. “They’ve got a tough job in the next few weeks in establishing with their lead investors as to what the right route for the business going forward is and whether there is sufficient in the technology to push shareholder patience further.” Pursuit Dynamics said it now expected revenue for the year ending Sept. 30 to be “materially below” its earlier expectations. “The company has been undertaking a strategic review of the business and in light of the P&G; decision the review will be accelerated to allow an update to be provided by the end of June 2012,” Pursuit Dynamics said in a statement. The company has not reported a profit for at least the past five years, and posted a loss of 15.3 million pounds in the year to September 2011. Last Friday, the company said talks with P&G; were “nearing an outcome” — a response to a sharp fall in its share price. It said, however, that it did not know of any reason for the share price fall. Online shareholder bulletin boards were busy with chat about the stock on Monday. “This company has been a disaster for many months now, and brings into question the value of their technology ... I retain some shares, but don’t have too much optimism as to their true value,” said one post. Pursuit Dynamics said it would hold a conference call for investors with its results announcement on Thursday. The company announced the joint development agreement with P&G; in late 2010, under which P&G; would use Pursuit Dynamics’ PDX Reactor technology on trial. PDX Reactor is designed to cut down on energy costs and fluid processing times via a process using high velocity steam. Pursuit Dynamics said P&G; had decided not to pursue further evaluation or development of the technology at this stage, and would not be entering into exclusive licensing discussions with the company. Shares in Pursuit Dynamics were down 78 percent at 15.75 pence at 1005 GMT on Monday on the London Stock Exchange, a far cry from their high of 732.5 pence about one and a half years ago.

121,PG,UPDATE 2-Tide to change Pods lid over child safety concerns,"* P&G; to add double latch to Tide Pods containers * Move comes after poison concerns * Single-dose laundry detergent relatively new to U.S. By Jessica Wohl May 25 (Reuters) - After at least one child was hospitalized for swallowing its prettily packaged detergent, Procter & Gamble Co said on Friday it will make Tide Pods more difficult to open. A double latch will be put on the lid of Tide Pods tubs and should be in markets in the next couple of weeks, P&G; spokesman Paul Fox said on Friday. The American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) issued a warning last week that people should keep highly concentrated, single-dose packs of detergent high up and out of the reach of children. According to the AAPCC, some young children who swallowed the small packets required hospitalization, while others got the detergent in their eyes. “Laundry packs, like any cleaning product, must be kept out of the reach of children,” P&G;’s Fox said. The AAPCC said that poison control centers have been receiving more calls about children exposed to single-dose laundry detergent packets. As of Thursday night, 317 cases have been reported to U.S. poison centers, AAPCC spokeswoman Loreeta Canton said. That is just a small fraction of total number of calls poison centers receive. In 2009, for example, U.S. poison centers took more than 4.2 million calls, or one every eight seconds. In one example, it said that a 15-month-old, who bit into a pack and swallowed a mouthful, vomited profusely, was brought to a hospital and put on a ventilator for airway protection.

Tide Pods also come in resealable bags, which P&G; will review as well. The back of the Tide Pods packaging states, in all capital letters, “Keep out of reach of children. Do not ingest. May irritate eyes,” in English, French and Spanish. Tide Pods, a single-dose blue, orange and white capsule, is the best-selling, single-dose laundry detergent in the United States. The product, introduced this year, has about a 60 percent share of the new and growing unit-dose detergent category. Other single-dose detergent brands include all mighty pacs, from Sun Products Corp, Arm & Hammer Power Paks from Church & Dwight Co Inc, and Purex UltraPacks from Henkel AG & Co  . Henkel spokeswoman Cindy Demers said the company learned of a few incidents of misuse of its product, which also carries a warning label urging people to keep the detergent out of reach of small children. “This is a new form of laundry product, and we will continue to join other manufacturers to safeguard and educate consumers on the correct storage and use of these products in the home,” she said. P&G;’s decision to change the packaging of Tide Pods comes after the product’s debut was delayed, first because demand from retailers was so strong, and then because the company could not ramp up production at a plant quickly enough to meet demand. P&G; Chairman and Chief Executive Bob McDonald said earlier this year that Tide Pods would be the company’s biggest innovation of 2012. It took P&G; eight years of research, with 75 technical staff working on the project full-time, to come up with Tide Pods.

122,PG,Tide to change Pods lid amid child safety concerns,"May 25 (Reuters) - After at least one child was hospitalized for swallowing its prettily packaged detergent, Procter & Gamble Co said on Friday it will make Tide Pods more difficult to open. A double latch will be put on the lid of Tide Pods tubs and should be in markets in the next couple of weeks, P&G; spokesman Paul Fox said on Friday. The American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) issued a warning last week that people should keep highly concentrated, single-dose packs of detergent high up and out of the reach of children. According to the AAPCC, some young children who swallowed the small packets required hospitalization, while others got the detergent in their eyes. “Laundry packs, like any cleaning product, must be kept out of the reach of children,” P&G;’s Fox said. The AAPCC said that poison control centers have been getting more calls about children exposed to single-dose laundry detergent packets. In one example, it said that a 15-month old, who bit into a pack and swallowed a mouthful vomited profusely, was brought to a hospital and put on a ventilator for airway protection.

123,PG,UPDATE 2-Fear of jury boredom seeps into Gupta insider trial,"* P&G; financial chief testifies on 2008 Folgers sale * Ex-trader tells jury tip came from Rajaratnam guy at P&G; * Gupta contends charges circumstantial, pleaded not guilty * Second Gupta juror excused for family emergency By Grant McCool NEW YORK, May 29 (Reuters) - The judge in the insider-trading trial of former corporate luminary Rajat Gupta is worried the jury is in danger of becoming bored. As the trial went into its second week on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan warned prosecutors and defense lawyers to “sharpen” their presentations. Gupta, 63, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc board member and global head of management consulting firm McKinsey & Co, is the most prominent corporate figure indicted in the U.S. government’s crackdown on insider trading. He is charged with leaking corporate secrets to now-imprisoned hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam, who was convicted last year after a high-profile trial. But Rakoff suggested the Gupta case may be far from scintillating for the jury, which aside from a handful of wiretap recordings, has been inundated with telephone logs, corporate governance guidelines, boardroom minutes, emails and instant messaging records. “I am in awe of our jury for being attentive,” Rakoff said in court while jurors were on their mid-afternoon break. He said the bulk of evidence was asking witnesses to look at “document X” or “document Y.” “We need to find a way to sharpen the presentation on both sides and get it more focused,” said Rakoff. The trial started on May 21 and so far the judge has excused two of the 12 jurors because of family emergencies. Their places were taken by alternate jurors. The trial could run three weeks. Gupta, who was arrested last October, has pleaded not guilty and argues that the prosecution’s evidence is circumstantial. Prosecutors contend that Gupta supplied inside information to Galleon Group founder Rajaratnam between March 2007 and January 2009 while serving on the boards of Goldman and Procter & Gamble Co. Rajaratnam and Gupta were friends. Gupta was nominal head of Galleon International and the pair opened a fund Voyager Capital Partners. On Tuesday, the jurors heard two starkly different versions of who could have leaked confidential information about P&G;’s $3 billion sale of its Folgers coffee unit in June 2008. Gupta’s main lawyer, Gary Naftalis, implied that any number among an array of company officials, investment bankers and lawyers who worked on the deal could have divulged it in the months leading up to the June 4, 2008 announcement with the buyer, J.M. Smucker Co. The suggestion was undercut by the testimony of a stock trader who said the tip came from someone at P&G; who knew Rajaratnam. Former Galleon trader, Michael Cardillo, said on the witness stand that in early June 2008, one of Rajaratnam’s brothers, RK Rajaratnam, also a Galleon money manager, told him P&G; was going to sell Folgers to Smucker. “He told me the information was coming from Raj’s guy at P&G;,” said Cardillo, who has pleaded guilty to insider trading charges and has agreed so far to testify as a prosecution witness in two trials. Cardillo gave similar testimony on Friday. P&G; Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller also testified on Tuesday. In questioning Moeller, defense lawyer Naftalis mentioned press leaks and those who worked on the deal. “So there were all of these people working on the transaction in addition to the Smucker’s people, true?” Naftalis asked Moeller, who responded: “Yes, that’s true.” One of the main defense arguments is that Rajaratnam had a network of sources. Rajaratnam, 53, was convicted on evidence largely based on court-approved wiretaps of his phones. He is appealing the use of wiretaps as he serves an 11-year prison term, the longest handed down for insider trading in the United States.

124,PG,UPDATE 1-Gupta lawyer implies others leaked on P&G;,"* P&G; financial chief testifies on 2008 Folgers sale * Second Gupta juror excused for family emergency * Gupta has pleaded not guilty to charges * Insider-trading trial now in second week By Grant McCool NEW YORK, May 29 (Reuters) - A number of people other than Rajat Gupta could have leaked confidential information about Procter & Gamble Co’s sale of its Folgers coffee unit in 2008, Gupta’s lawyer implied to the jury at his insider-trading trial on Tuesday. Gupta, a former director at P&G; and Goldman Sachs Group Inc , is accused in U.S. District Court in Manhattan of telling now-imprisoned hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam about the $3 billion Folgers sale to J.M. Smucker & Co before it was publicly announced on June 4, 2008. In his questioning of P&G; Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller, defense lawyer Gary Naftalis mentioned press leaks of the Folgers transaction and the array of lawyers, investment bankers, external-relations advisers and corporate tax specialists who worked on the deal. “So there were all of these people working on the transaction in addition to the Smucker’s people, true?” Naftalis asked Moeller, who responded: “Yes, that’s true.” Gupta, 63, also a former global head of management consulting firm McKinsey & Co, is the most prominent corporate figure indicted in the U.S. government’s recent crackdown on insider trading. He is charged with giving Rajaratnam tips involving Goldman and P&G; between March 2007 and January 2009. Gupta, who was arrested last October, has pleaded not guilty and argues that the prosecution’s evidence is circumstantial. One of the main defense arguments is that Galleon Group hedge fund founder Rajaratnam had a network of sources providing him with inside information. Rajaratnam, 53, was convicted a year ago on evidence largely based on court-approved wiretaps of his phones. He is appealing the use of wiretaps as he serves an 11-year prison term, the longest handed down for insider trading in the United States. Prosecutors also contend that the day before P&G; announced quarterly earnings in January 2009, Gupta called Rajaratnam from Davos, Switzerland, and told him that P&G; expected its organic sales to grow 2 percent to 5 percent for the fiscal year, less than the guidance previously provided to the market. Moeller, who was called as a prosecution witness, testified under questioning by Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Tarlowe that the sales information was confidential until the company made an announcement to the public. Also on Tuesday, a second juror on the 12-member panel dropped out of the trial due to a family emergency. Juror No. 4, an executive assistant at a hospital, was excused and replaced by an alternate, a marketing manager for a publishing company. The place of juror No. 12, a professor of strategic design and behavior, was taken on Thursday by another of the four alternates, a retired librarian, also due to a family emergency. The trial, which began May 21, is expected to run about three weeks. To convict Gupta of insider trading, the jury must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he breached his fiduciary duties and that he did it intentionally and in anticipation of at least some modest benefit in return.

125,PG,Goldman CEO tells jury about board confidentiality,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs Group Inc, told jurors at the insider-trading trial of one of the investment bank’s former directors that “all parts” of a 2008 board meeting the two attended were confidential. “If something is discussed in a board meeting, it is confidential,” Blankfein said, when asked about a June 2008 board meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia, that he and defendant Rajat Gupta both attended. “All parts of it were confidential.” Blankfein took the stand at the Manhattan federal court trial of Gupta, the second time in 14 months that the Goldman leader has been a star government witness at a major insider-trading trial. Last year, he testified at the trial of Raj Rajaratnam, the now-imprisoned hedge fund manager whom Gupta is accused of tipping with some of Goldman’s most guarded secrets. The June 2008 board meeting is not directly connected to any of the charges in the case, but an FBI wiretap of Rajaratnam’s phone begins with Rajaratnam telling Gupta he heard a rumor that “Goldman might look to buy a commercial bank.” Gupta’s response is that “this was a big discussion at the board meeting.” Goldman did not acquire any bank. The two also discussed another board meeting topic, whether Goldman should consider acquiring insurance giant American International Group Inc. Rajaratnam did not trade on the speculation and Goldman did not buy AIG. Blankfein and Gupta did not look at each other as Blankfein entered the courtroom, but as he left the witness stand during a jury break, Blankfein raised his head and eyebrows in acknowledgment of Gupta, who stood at the defense table. Gupta’s tense expression did not change, but his gaze followed Blankfein. U.S. prosecutors called Blankfein to underline evidence of corporate confidentiality and fiduciary duties that the jurors have already heard several times since the trial began on May 21. Assistant U.S. Attorney Reed Brodsky asked Blankfein to read parts of Goldman’s confidentiality and ethics policies. He was also guided through rules for the board of directors and boardroom meeting minutes in 2007 and 2008 to set the stage for events at Goldman tied to the insider trading charges against Gupta. “At this time there were a lot of economic events, a lot of external events, affecting the fortunes of the firm,” testified Blankfein, who is also chairman of the Goldman board. Tuesday is a free day for the trial and Blankfein’s testimony will resume on either Wednesday or Thursday. Prosecutors contend that Gupta, 63, passed inside tips to Rajaratnam about the bank’s financial results in 2007 and a $5 billion investment in Goldman from billionaire Warren Buffett at the height of the financial crisis in September 2008. Rajaratnam was convicted of 14 insider-trading counts last year and he is serving an 11-year prison term. If convicted, Gupta also faces years in prison, although not as lengthy a term as Rajaratnam. Gupta, a retired former global head of the McKinsey & Co consulting firm, and Rajaratnam have been the two most prominent defendants in the U.S. government’s crackdown on insider trading in recent years. Gupta has pleaded not guilty, arguing through his lawyers that the government’s case is circumstantial and speculative. Gupta’s lawyers say their client had nothing to gain financially by giving inside stock tips to Rajaratnam, the founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund. Gupta and Rajaratnam were friends and business associates. Goldman has not been accused of wrongdoing. According to the indictment, Gupta told Rajaratnam about Goldman’s first-quarter 2007 earnings the day before the information was made public. Gupta also is accused of tipping the hedge fund manager seconds after the Goldman board approved a $5 billion investment by Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc on September 23, 2008. The trial, before U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, is expected to run through this week before it goes to the jury. In one of the day’s lighter moments after the jury had left for the day, Rakoff and Blankfein had an exchange over the Goldman chief’s scheduled visit on Wednesday to Yonkers, a city on the border with New York, for part of his daughter’s high school graduation celebration. Rakoff lives in Yonkers. “I’m going to this restaurant in Yonkers that you probably know,” Blankfein told the judge, who responded: “If it’s the one that I’m thinking of, I probably can’t afford it.” The case is USA v Gupta, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 11-907.

128,PG,Gupta trial defense bids to sow doubt with phone records,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for former Goldman Sachs Group Inc board member Rajat Gupta on Wednesday tried to use phone records to sow doubt at his insider-trading trial about contact with now-imprisoned hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam. Gupta, 63, a onetime global head of McKinsey & Co management consultancy, is charged with securities fraud and conspiracy in U.S. District Court in New York over allegations he leaked boardroom secrets to Rajaratnam and his Galleon Group between March 2007 and January 2009. Phone records introduced to the jury by prosecutors showed that Gupta’s phone and Rajaratnam’s phone connecting numerous times in 2007 and 2008. A Goldman employee, Joe Yanigisawa, verified the records but was then asked by a defense lawyer about certain telephone connections between the Galleon office and another number assigned to Goldman Sachs employee David Loeb in New York. He confirmed numerous calls between Loeb and Rajaratnam or one of his traders, Adam Smith, on the sheets of phone numbers. A main defense argument is that Rajaratnam had sources other than Gupta to provide him confidential company information. Smith has pleaded guilty in the case. Rajaratnam was convicted at trial a year ago. Galleon was a client of Goldman Sachs and Loeb was one of the sales executives who dealt regularly with the hedge fund, according to trial evidence. Loeb, who has not been charged with any wrongdoing, could not be reached to comment. A Goldman Sachs spokesman, Michael DuVally, declined to comment. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, who started testifying on Monday but did not finish, will resume his testimony. The jury had a free day on Tuesday because Judge Jed Rakoff went to Washington, D.C., to speak at an annual conference for compliance and regulatory lawyers and officers. Gupta denies the charges that he tipped Rajaratnam while serving on the boards of Goldman and Procter & Gamble. The defense says the government’s case is circumstantial and speculative. On the third day of the trial on May 23, a prosecutor told the judge during a jury break that Loeb provided Rajaratnam with information about Intel Corp, Apple Inc and Hewlett Packard, but nothing about information on the trades at the center of the Gupta case. One of the prosecution’s allegations is that Gupta tipped Rajaratnam about a deal that gave Goldman a $5-billion boost from renowned investor Warren Buffet at the height of the financial crisis in September 2008, in an illegal breach of his fiduciary duties. Prosecutors contend that Gupta tipped Rajaratnam 16 seconds after a conference call in which the Goldman board approved the Buffett investment, just minutes before markets closed at 4 p.m. on September 23, 2008. Rajaratnam then hurriedly ordered his traders to buy Goldman stock, reaping $840,000 in profits when the stock rose the next day, according to trial evidence. The Buffett investment was not made public until two hours later. Alson on Wednesday, a former Galleon portfolio manager, Isvari Mahadeva, testified that Gupta stood to profit from investments he made in funds managed by now-imprisoned Rajaratnam. He was convicted at trial last year and is serving an 11-year prison term, which was the longest for insider trading until a lawyer was sentenced on Monday to 12 years in Newark, New Jersey. Whether Gupta, 63, actually profited is in dispute at the trial. Gupta’s lawyers say he lost all of a $10 million investment with Rajaratnam and that Gupta, a multimillionaire, had nothing to gain financially by passing corporate secrets to the fund manager. The case is USA v Gupta, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 11-907.

131,PG,"P&G; cuts forecast, will focus on big businesses","CHICAGO/LONDON (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co took the blame on Wednesday for a lack of big new products and not being quick enough to cut costs as it deals with persistent slowing demand in Western Europe, the United States and China. The world’s largest household-products maker cut its growth forecasts for a second time in two months on Wednesday, as expected, and said it did not expect to repurchase shares in the coming fiscal year as it tries to maintain its “AA-“ credit rating. P&G;’s comments come a day after shipping company FedEx Corp warned about slowing global economic growth, and foodmaker Danone SA said its profits would be hit as Spanish consumers switched to cheaper yogurt. The U.S. maker of products such as Tide laundry detergent and Gillette razors said it would focus on its 40 biggest businesses, 20 biggest new products and 10 most important developing markets in a bid to shore up profits. P&G;’s shares fell 3.2 percent to $60.20 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of several P&G; rivals with global exposure, including Unilever and Colgate-Palmolive, also fell. While analysts said the company seemed to be taking the right steps to spur operating profit growth, which has stagnated during Chief Executive Bob McDonald’s three years at the helm, there was concern the plans would take some time to bear fruit. “The company’s margin of error seems narrow ... cementing P&G; as another (consumer packaged goods) ‘show-me’ story over the next 12 months,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj. He suggested during an interview that McDonald’s job could be at stake if there was another earnings disappointment next year. “If there is another lowering of the bar, I’m not sure if this management team has a lot of longevity,” he said. P&G; has frustrated investors with its inability to increase operating profit in recent years. Sales have been hurt by slowing global economies and the strong dollar, and higher commodity costs have eroded earnings. But Chief Executive McDonald focused some of the blame on the company, which has also raised prices too much on some products. “It’s our job to overcome these (external factors), but we haven’t always been able to do this, in part because we haven’t been hitting on all cylinders internally,” he said. One disappointing area has been in the lack of innovation from a company that used to develop whole new categories, such as the Swiffer floor mop in 1999 and the Whitestrips tooth whitening product in 2001. “We haven’t created a new category or a meaningful new brand in some time,” McDonald said. To solve this, the company is reducing the number of products in development, focusing on the biggest 20, he said. The company also plans to focus on its 40 biggest businesses, which represent about half of sales and 70 percent of profit, and its 10 most important developing markets, including Brazil, China and Russia. “The company seemed much more aware of their recent shortcomings and determined to fix them,” J.P. Morgan analyst John Faucher said in a note to clients. McDonald cut his underlying sales forecast for P&G;’s April-to-June fourth quarter to growth of 2 percent to 3 percent, down from 4 percent to 5 percent, while the core quarterly earnings target was trimmed to 75 to 79 cents per share, from 79 to 85 cents. He said growth in developed markets, making up 60 percent of sales, had dropped off significantly, while in emerging markets, P&G; suffered mandated price cuts in Venezuela and import curbs in Argentina. McDonald said it would take time to reverse the negative trends, and he expected little improvement in fiscal 2013, which begins July 1. He forecast underlying sales growth of 2 percent to 4 percent as the group begins to recover its overall market share. He also forecast 2013 core earnings would be flat to up by a mid single-digit percentage. Stripping out foreign exchange, core earnings per share would show growth of a mid-to-high single-digit percentage.

McDonald cut his underlying sales forecast for P&G;’s April-to-June fourth quarter to growth of 2 percent to 3 percent, down from 4 percent to 5 percent, while the core quarterly earnings target was trimmed to 75 to 79 cents per share, from 79 to 85 cents. He said growth in developed markets, making up 60 percent of sales, had dropped off significantly, while in emerging markets, P&G; suffered mandated price cuts in Venezuela and import curbs in Argentina. McDonald said it would take time to reverse the negative trends, and he expected little improvement in fiscal 2013, which begins July 1. He forecast underlying sales growth of 2 percent to 4 percent as the group begins to recover its overall market share. He also forecast 2013 core earnings would be flat to up by a mid single-digit percentage. Stripping out foreign exchange, core earnings per share would show growth of a mid-to-high single-digit percentage. P&G; is currently undergoing a restructuring plan to cut 5,700 non-manufacturing jobs and $10 billion of costs by the end of 2015/16.",6202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/proctergamble-outlook/update-5-pg-cuts-forecast-will-focus-on-big-businesses-idUSL5E8HK4VH20120620
133,PG,"US STOCKS-Wall St quiet ahead of Fed, P&G; slides","* Fed statement awaited, Operation Twist extension seen likely * Procter & Gamble slips after outlook * Dow, Nasdaq flat, S&P; off 0.1 pct By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, June 20 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks hovered near break-even in low volume on Wednesday, after four days of gains on the S&P; 500, as traders awaited the outcome of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting. Shares of companies that make consumer products weighed, with blue-chip Procter & Gamble Co down more than 3 percent after it cut its growth forecasts. The Fed is set to announce its monetary policy decision at 12:30 p.m (1630 GMT), followed by a press conference with Chairman Ben Bernanke at 2:15 (1815 GMT). Many expect the central bank to extend its “Operation Twist,” a program aimed at supporting the economy by pushing down longer-term interest rates, thus spurring consumer spending. The S&P; 500 has risen about 7 percent from a five-month low hit earlier in June and any disappointment stemming from the Fed’s decision could trigger a sharp selloff. The benchmark closed Tuesday above its 50-day moving average for the first time in seven weeks and at its highest since May 10. “Everybody’s figuring (the Fed is) going to revise unemployment projections up and GDP down, but if they say they’re going to extend Operation Twist or do some sort of QE3 or start buying mortgage backed securities aggressively that would be a positive,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of US equity trading at Canaccord Genuity. Markets are expected to be volatile after the statement as traders sift through the specifics and the language used by the Fed. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 4.58 points, or 0.04 percent, to 12,832.75. The S&P; 500 Index dipped 1.88 points, or 0.14 percent, to 1,356.10. The Nasdaq Composite  edged up 0.37 point, or 0.01 percent, to 2,930.13. European shares edged higher in choppy trading ahead of the Fed announcement. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.3 percent. Procter & Gamble shares fell 3.3 percent to $60.15 after the world’s largest household product maker cut its growth forecasts. Adobe Systems slid 4.1 percent to $31.55 after the maker of Photoshop and Acrobat software cut its full-year revenue outlook and warned about weak demand in Europe.

The world’s largest household products maker said on Wednesday that after stripping out foreign exchange effects, core earnings per share would show growth of a mid-to-high single digit percentage in the fiscal year beginning July 1. For the current fourth quarter of April through June, the maker of Tide laundry detergents and Gillette razors cut its underlying sales growth forecast to between 2 and 3 percent from 4 to 5 percent previously. It said earnings were now expected in the range between 75 and 79 cents a share, from a previous target of 79 to 85 cents.

137,PG,"Activist investor Ackman buys into P&G;, shares rise","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Activist investor William Ackman looks ready to take on management at yet another major company as he builds a stake in the iconic U.S. household products company Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N). Ackman’s $10 billion Pershing Square Capital Management has been buying shares in P&G; for the last few weeks and may want to increase its stake further, a person familiar with the portfolio said on Thursday. Pershing Square received antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to purchase the shares according to a public notice. P&G;, for its part, said it welcomed new investors. The size of stake has not been disclosed and may not become public until Pershing lodges a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Word that an activist investor is now circling the maker of Tide detergent, Pampers diapers and Crest toothpaste comes only a few weeks after P&G; said that profits and sales will be lower as it struggles to navigate tough economic conditions. The interest of Ackman, who has been instrumental in shaking up management at Canadian Pacific Railway (CP.TO) and retailer J.C. Penney (JCP.N), saw P&G; shares close 3.7 percent higher and helped the blue-chip Dow index cut its loss. Procter & Gamble Chief Executive Bob McDonald, who has been at the helm of the Cincinnati-based company since 2009, has recently acknowledged missteps and the company is implementing programs to try and make itself more competitive. “We are focused on creating shareholder value by executing on our plan to deliver top and bottom line growth through our $10 billion cost savings program, renewing our focus on innovation, pricing initiatives and improved execution, and reallocating resources to invest in the highest return opportunities,” P&G; spokesman Paul Fox said. Analysts have been more critical lately about McDonald’s moves and speculated about how an activist might change things. “From the beginning of McDonald’s CEO-ship, we wrote that he should embark on more aggressive cost-cutting, which he did not do. He has finally now stepped it up when he was forced to do so,” analysts at Caris & Co wrote in a note. While speculation has swirled that Ackman might soon push for a new CEO to come in, as he has at other companies, analysts agreed that any potential management shakeup may not happen soon. “I don’t think his involvement will change anything really, right now,” UBS analyst Nik Modi said of Ackman, explaining that McDonald has a few quarters to prove that he can change the course of things. At P&G;, Ackman will join a long list of other powerful investors including billionaire Warren Buffett whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) is one of the top five shareholders. Any shareholder who wants to present potential business-related proposals to the company faces a July 13 deadline which is set by the company, months before its annual meeting later this year. Ackman is moving on to P&G; only a few months after scoring a big victory in Canada where he was able to unseat the chief executive officer at Canadian Pacific Railway after winning a bitter proxy contest. At J.C. Penney, Ackman was also instrumental in wooing Ron Johnson from Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to run the ailing retail chain. Ackman began building his Penney position two years ago but due to a sharp decline in the stock price, the position is currently hurting his portfolio.

The Dow briefly moved into positive territory in sync with Procter & Gamble’s advance, with the blue-chip average bouncing off technical support at 12,500, analysts said. The S&P; 500  earlier traded below its 50-day moving average at 1,334. “We tested (1,334) and bounced, but the flavor of the market is still somewhat tenuous, given the testing of these technical support levels and also the strength in the 10-year bond,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president of BB&T; Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 11/32 in price, with the yield at 1.482 percent. The Dow pared most of its loss, getting a lift from the shares of Procter & Gamble - up 4.6 percent at $64.22 -  after a source said activist investor William Ackman appears to be building a stake in the U.S. household products company.  Merck & Co. shares also bolstered the Dow. Merck’s stock rose 4.1 percent to $42.91 after a pivotal trial of Merck’s experimental osteoporosis drug odanacatib has shown that it reduces the risk of fracture. But overall, market sentiment was weak, especially after the lack of any monetary easing by the Bank of Japan on Thursday, and few clues in the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s June policy meeting, released on Wednesday. The lack of policy moves suggested major central banks were still cautious about the need for further easing. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 5.56 points, or 0.04 percent, at 12,598.97. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 4.32 points, or 0.32 percent, at 1,337.13. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 18.84 points, or 0.65 percent, at 2,869.14. Technology shares have been among the worst performers recently, bogged down by profit warnings from companies such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Applied Materials Inc . For the month, the S&P; technology sector is down 4 percent and the PHLX semiconductor sector is off 8.7 percent. U.S.-listed shares of Infosys Ltd  tumbled 11.1 percent to $38.80, after earlier dropping to an all-time low of $38.12.

140,PG,Ackman may take time to unveil game plan for P&G; stake,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) was worth $10.11 billion more on Friday afternoon as investors counted on activist investor William Ackman to spur big changes at the world’s biggest household products maker. But as the initial euphoria over Ackman’s investment passes, investors should count on having to wait awhile for the next move, if his track record is any indication. Ackman has not yet said what he plans to do with his new investment in P&G;, disclosed on Thursday, and he could not be reached for comment on Friday. But the mere fact of his Pershing Capital buy-in may push the maker of Pampers diapers and Gillette razors and other household names to improve its profitability more quickly and work on its restructuring more aggressively. Ackman’s involvement could force P&G; to cut costs even more than the $10 billion it outlined in February, and may spur the board to consider whether a management change is needed, analysts and investors said. “We view it as a positive as it puts more pressure on the board and management to kind of make the changes a little quicker and steeper,” Vic Lassandro, managing director of RiverPoint Capital Management, said of Ackman’s buy-in. Eliminating more costs through cutting jobs and overhead spending is “probably the biggest opportunity to make changes, aside from management,” said Lassandro, whose firm has about $1.1 billion in assets including roughly 200,000 shares of P&G.; Shares of P&G; rose 2.2 percent to $65.09 on Friday on the heels of a 3.7 percent rise on Thursday. P&G; declined to comment and has not said whether it has hired an adviser since it learned of Ackman’s stake. Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has been the firm of choice for several of Ackman’s targets. J.C. Penney (JCP.N) hired the firm in October 2010 to help defend against a fight with Ackman, who had started loading up on the retailer’s stock that summer. Before that, Target Corp (TGT.N) relied on Goldman to beat back Ackman’s proxy challenge in 2009. Ackman is known to place big bets, and often has no more than a dozen names in his portfolio. He has frequently unveiled big holdings in the early fall, announcing his stake in railroad operator Canadian Pacific Railway (CP.TO) in October 2011 and announcing the J.C. Penney stake in October 2010. With most firms, Ackman likes to begin the conversation on a polite note, often volunteering to fly out to the company’s headquarters from his New York base to meet with management and present his plans for improvement, people familiar with his past campaigns have said. Ackman can also be seen to be pushy and impatient, which has cooled relations with some companies. Relations with Target became strained but Ackman kept his holding in the discount retailer even after he lost an expensive and emotional proxy contest. “One of their jobs is to become a mouthpiece for investors who are frustrated. I think you have a lot of investors who are frustrated,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj. “The size of the investor frustration is proportional to the size of the company.” P&G; is one of the biggest U.S. companies. Its $178 billion in market capitalization places it in the top 15 in the Standard & Poors 500 index .SPX. Sales topped $82 billion last year. While some continue to believe P&G; is too big, a break-up along the lines of the one Ackman helped push at the former Fortune Brands BEAM.N or the pending split of Kraft Foods Inc KFT.O is unlikely. “I don’t see them splitting the company up or anything like that,” said Lassandro. P&G; asserts that its size and variety are benefits and has already sold off non-core units such as Folgers coffee and Pringles chips. Duracell and Braun remain on the radars of investors and analysts as other businesses P&G; could still sell. “Obviously, we think there’s tremendous advantage to having the scale that we have,” P&G; Chief Executive Bob McDonald said during a January conference call, before the restructuring and other plans were announced. Ackman prefers to conduct his initial discussions out of the limelight. Traditionally, he has come prepared with specific proposals for change at other companies. At Penney, for example, he had long had his eye on recruiting Apple’s Ron Johnson, making a first pass at him as a possible board member. Up until now, when Ackman has waged battles to remove a CEO, the replacements have generally been outsiders. Bringing in an outsider to run P&G; would be a tremendous change for a company that prides itself on grooming young executives and moving them up the corporate ladder over decades. McDonald, P&G;’s CEO since 2009, went from being a captain in the U.S. Army to being a P&G; brand assistant in June 1980 and has never left. His predecessor A.G. Lafley headed from Harvard Business School to P&G;, where he spent more than 30 years. There are several potential candidates who could be good fits for the board, if not new members of management, who have past experience with P&G;, Dibadj said. Those include former Gillette CEO Jim Kilts, who stayed with P&G; briefly after it bought his company in 2005; Lafley; former P&G; Chief Financial Officer Clayt Daley; Kerry Clark, the retired CEO of Cardinal Health who spent 32 years at P&G; and former P&G; executives Rob Steele, Susan Arnold and Ed Shirley.

With most firms, Ackman likes to begin the conversation on a polite note, often volunteering to fly out to the company’s headquarters from his New York base to meet with management and present his plans for improvement, people familiar with his past campaigns have said. Ackman can also be seen to be pushy and impatient, which has cooled relations with some companies. Relations with Target became strained but Ackman kept his holding in the discount retailer even after he lost an expensive and emotional proxy contest. “One of their jobs is to become a mouthpiece for investors who are frustrated. I think you have a lot of investors who are frustrated,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj. “The size of the investor frustration is proportional to the size of the company.” P&G; is one of the biggest U.S. companies. Its $178 billion in market capitalization places it in the top 15 in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index. Sales topped $82 billion last year. While some continue to believe P&G; is too big, a break-up along the lines of the one Ackman helped push at the former Fortune Brands or the pending split of Kraft Foods Inc  is unlikely. “I don’t see them splitting the company up or anything like that,” said Lassandro. P&G; asserts that its size and variety are benefits and has already sold off non-core units such as Folgers coffee and Pringles chips. Duracell and Braun remain on the radars of investors and analysts as other businesses P&G; could still sell. “Obviously, we think there’s tremendous advantage to having the scale that we have,” P&G; Chief Executive Bob McDonald said during a January conference call, before the restructuring and other plans were announced. Ackman prefers to conduct his initial discussions out of the limelight. Traditionally, he has come prepared with specific proposals for change at other companies. At Penney, for example, he had long had his eye on recruiting Apple’s Ron Johnson, making a first pass at him as a possible board member. Up until now, when Ackman has waged battles to remove a CEO, the replacements have generally been outsiders. Bringing in an outsider to run P&G; would be a tremendous change for a company that prides itself on grooming young executives and moving them up the corporate ladder over decades. McDonald, P&G;’s CEO since 2009, went from being a captain in the U.S. Army to being a P&G; brand assistant in June 1980 and has never left. His predecessor A.G. Lafley headed from Harvard Business School to P&G;, where he spent more than 30 years. There are several potential candidates who could be good fits for the board, if not new members of management, who have past experience with P&G;, Dibadj said. Those include former Gillette CEO Jim Kilts, who stayed with P&G; briefly after it bought his company in 2005; Lafley; former P&G; Chief Financial Officer Clayt Daley; Kerry Clark, the retired CEO of Cardinal Health who spent 32 years at P&G; and former P&G; executives Rob Steele, Susan Arnold and Ed Shirley.",7162012,http://www.reuters.com/article/procter-ackman/rpt-ackman-may-take-time-to-unveil-game-plan-for-pg-stake-idUSL2E8IG29X20120716

152,PG,Unilever's growth helps it avoid pitfalls of rivals,"LONDON, July 26 (Reuters) - Strong emerging market growth helped consumer good giant Unilever Plc  avoid the profit warnings of two of its arch rivals although it cautioned of tougher times ahead due to difficult economies and volatile input costs. The maker of brands such as Dove and Knorr is facing tough trading in southern Europe and seeing some commodities costs edge up although it stuck to its 2012 targets rather than alarm investors like Danone and Procter & Gamble. Unilever, with annual sales of 46.5 billion euros, reported second quarter underlying sales rose 5.8 percent on Thursday helped by its less exposure to problem economies such as Spain than Danone while it has more business in fast growing markets like India and Indonesia than P&G.; The 5.8 percent quarterly sales rise beat a company-compiled consensus of 4.8 percent and came after a first quarter 8.4 percent increase and 6.5 percent growth for 2011. Emerging markets, which makes up 56 percent of sales, saw growth of 11 percent. Unilever, the world’s No.3 consumer goods group after Nestle  and P&G;, held its forecast for modest profit margin expansion this year. Its half year profit margin was flat, but analysts expect it to rise in the second half.

153,PG,"Procter & Gamble profit tops forecast, plans buybacks","(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit despite a drop in sales, as the world’s largest household products maker tries to prove that it can make the improvements needed to move past recent disappointments. The maker of Tide laundry detergent, Olay skin cream and a host of other products also reversed course by announcing a $4 billion share repurchase program just weeks after saying it would not buy back shares this year. The results, released on Friday, are being watched closely for any signals of how well P&G; and its current leadership can fix a long list of problems, especially after activist investor William Ackman stepped in and bought about $1.8 billion worth of its shares. “Procter & Gamble is a great company, it’s a blue chip, it’s well-known, but the results that we have seen over the last couple of years have just been pretty uninspiring,” said Channing Smith, co-manager of the Capital Advisors Growth Fund (CIAOX.O). “It’s a show-me story for the next couple of quarters.” P&G; announced a $10 billion restructuring in February and in June cut expectations as it launched a more focused strategy. During a nearly 90-minute conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Bob McDonald and Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller repeatedly outlined the steps they believe will right their $83.68 billion ship, from cutting more jobs to setting the right level of investment in sluggish developed markets and growing in developing ones where P&G; has less of a presence. “It really comes down to them delivering what they say,” said UBS analyst Nik Modi, who has a “neutral” rating on the shares. “The message sounded like, ‘Hey, give us some time, we’re showing you that what we’re doing is working, give us some time.’ ... Obviously that was designed, I believe, to address the stake Ackman has taken.” P&G;’s forecast for the current quarter sits below Wall Street’s estimate, suggesting it could take several more months before the bulk of the company’s efforts pay off. P&G;, whose other brands include Pampers and Gillette, said it had talked with Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management, but did not divulge details of those discussions. Last month it said the board backs McDonald and his turnaround plan and is monitoring the effectiveness of the strategy. For years, P&G; was able to grow as shoppers tried out new products from Swiffer dusters to Crest teeth-whitening strips, but it admits to falling short in innovation of late. Its latest major new item, Tide Pods concentrated laundry detergent, got off to a slow start. The next big new products with what McDonald calls “disruptive innovation” will not hit stores until fiscal 2014, he said. P&G; now plans to repurchase $4 billion worth of its shares this fiscal year, after calling off buybacks in June because it wanted to preserve its credit rating. Moeller said P&G; had changed its mind because it had growing confidence in its turnaround plan and more cash on hand than it had anticipated in June, while interest rates continued to fall. Shares of P&G;, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, were up 3.5 percent at $65.72 on Friday afternoon. P&G; has struggled as growth dropped off significantly in developed markets, which make up 60 percent of sales, while in emerging markets, it is dealing with mandated price cuts in Venezuela and import curbs in Argentina. “We know what has to be done at Procter & Gamble, and we’re taking the right steps to get it done,” said McDonald, who has been at the helm of Cincinnati-based P&G; since July 2009. P&G; earned $3.63 billion, or $1.24 per share, in the fourth quarter ended on June 30, compared with $2.51 billion or 84 cents per share a year earlier. Core earnings, or profit from continuing operations excluding items, were 82 cents per share, in line with a year earlier. That surpassed the company’s June forecast of 75 to 79 cents and the analysts’ average estimate of 77 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A better-than-anticipated tax rate accounted for 3 cents of the earnings per share, Moeller said. P&G; said it expected core earnings of $3.80 to $4.00 this year. Analysts on average expect it to earn $3.88 per share. For the current first quarter, P&G; expects to post core earnings of 91 to 97 cents per share. The analysts’ average forecast is $1.03. The company’s job cuts are coming in ahead of schedule. P&G; planned to eliminate 10 percent of its 57,000 nonmanufacturing jobs, with 1,600 layoffs expected in fiscal 2012 and another 4,100 during fiscal 2013. P&G; has cut 5 percent of nonmanufacturing jobs so far and now expects to complete the majority of the 10 percent headcount reduction by the end of this calendar year, McDonald said. Over time, there could be further reductions beyond the 10 percent, Moeller said.

154,PG,TEXT-S&P;:Procter & Gamble rtgs unaffected by share buyback,"Aug 03 - Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services said today that its rating and outlook on Procter & Gamble Co. (AA-/Stable/A-1+) are not currently affected by the company’s announcement that it will resume share repurchases in fiscal 2013. The company now plans to buy back $4 billion of stock in fiscal 2013, similar to levels repurchased in fiscal 2012. The buybacks are expected to be funded through free cash flow generation and potentially a moderate amount of incremental debt. Despite potentially higher debt levels, we do not view the company’s announcement as a material departure from its existing financial policy, which we continue to view as moderate. Although we expect cash flow metrics will be below levels indicative of the company’s “modest” financial risk profile (which includes maintaining a ratio of funds from operations to total debt between 45% to 60%), our view of the company’s financial risk profile is still supported by the company’s substantial and steady cash flow generation, in addition to its cash on hand and our view that the company will continue to maintain “strong” liquidity over the next two to three years. We also expect that the company will be able to manage this share repurchase activity to maintain credit measures consistent with our expectations. This includes maintaining a ratio of total debt to EBITDA in the 2x area, and funds from operations to total debt close to 40%. Although the company’s operating performance was below our expectations in fiscal 2012, we believe that the company’s recent restructuring efforts should help boost profitability in fiscal 2013.",8032012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWLA145220120803

The results, released on Friday, are being watched closely for any early signals of how well P&G; and its current leadership can fix a long list of problems, especially after activist investor William Ackman stepped in and bought about $1.8 billion worth of its shares.

McDonald, who has been at the helm of Cincinnati-based P&G; since July 2009, unveiled a $10 billion restructuring program in February and also is refocusing on core categories, countries and innovations. Some analysts have suggested that the company could cut more than outlined in the $10 billion plan. “We know what has to be done at Procter & Gamble, and we’re taking the right steps to get it done,” McDonald said. The company’s job cuts are coming in ahead of schedule. P&G; planned to eliminate 10 percent of its 57,000 nonmanufacturing jobs, with 1,600 layoffs expected in fiscal 2012 and another 4,100 during fiscal 2013.

160,PG,CORRECTED-Companies score gold at 2012 Olympics,"(Corrects spelling of Procter & Gamble in 3rd and 7th paras) By Natasha Baker TORONTO, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Athletes captured the spotlight at the 2012 Summer Games but a social marketing web app helped companies score gold with consumers during what has been dubbed as the first social media Olympics. Wildfire, the social media management web software recently bought by Google and used by 16,000 companies worldwide, enabled firms to create Olympics promotions and campaigns on social platforms and track fan growth and engagement. Some of the official sponsors of the Games, which included Procter & Gamble, Coca Cola and Visa, saw their fanbases grow by millions of followers, and a doubling of their engagement levels throughout the games, according to Wildfire data analyst James Lancaster. “Olympics on social media had a huge role for brands. Not only were fanbases growing by huge amounts but fans were really interacting with brand pages,” he said. The company tracked a Facebook metric known as “people talking about this,” which is a combination of the number of posts made to a brand page’s wall, in addition to likes, shares and comments. “That’s really important for brands because it really brings brand awareness when you have people who are liking, and commenting and sharing a posting because you’ll see it in your newsfeed and it sort of takes off virally,” Lancaster explained. For Procter & Gamble, this score grew by 216 percent, for Coca Cola by 126 percent and for Visa by 67 percent. “P&G; was an example of a sponsor who did this very well,” said Lancaster. The company’s campaign featured a series of videos showing athletes talking about their mothers, which were widely shared across social networks. “In the media and in terms of virality, this was one of the biggest campaigns that any of the brands ran during the games. It really resonated,” said Emily Pereira, director of communications for Wildfire, which is based in Redwood City, California. Lancaster attributed social media success among the official sponsors to two things: the ability to leverage Olympics branding in their content and implementing social media best practices, such as engaging fans through polls, questions and photo-sharing. Whether it was for a multinational clothing brand or an outdoor gear shop, linking the product to the Games and the city that played host was key to consumer engagement. According to Pereira, thousands of companies ran Olympics-themed promotions such as contests, sweepstakes and polls using Wildfire on social platforms. Some firms also embedded live feeds and videos of events in London. “If there was any obvious way of tying the Olympics or London to what they were selling they definitely took advantage of that opportunity,” she said.

161,PG,P&G; CEO's pay down 6.1 percent after tough year,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bob McDonald took home a little less last year after disappointing results that he is trying to reverse with a major overhaul. McDonald, the leader of the world’s largest household products company since 2009, earned nearly $15.2 million in the year ended in June, down 6.1 percent from $16.19 million in fiscal 2011, according to a filing P&G; made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday. P&G;, whose brands include Pampers, Gillette and Tide, is in the midst of a $10 billion restructuring. On top of that, activist investor William Ackman bought roughly $1.8 billion worth of its stock this summer. While Ackman has not yet pushed for any changes at the company, P&G;’s board came out in July in support of McDonald and his turnaround plan. In June, P&G; took the blame for a lack of big new products and not cutting costs fast enough as demand slows in some major markets. McDonald said it would take time to reverse the negative trends and that he expected little improvement in fiscal 2013, which began on July 1. McDonald’s salary was flat in fiscal 2012 at $1.6 million. With 89 percent of his total pay tied to the company’s performance, his overall payout declined as P&G;’s results came in below target. His bonus fell by $200,000, to $2.43 million. Most of McDonald’s compensation comes in stock and option awards. Their combined value fell 8 percent to $10.85 million. Shares of P&G; were down 0.3 percent at $66.49 in early trading. The shares fell 3.6 percent to $61.25 during fiscal 2012. Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller made a little bit more in fiscal 2012. His salary rose by $75,000 to $825,000, the latest in a steady stream of increases since he became CFO in 2009. Moeller’s bonus declined, falling to $762,127 from $781,121. P&G;’s two vice chairmen earned more in the latest fiscal year after taking on expanded roles following the departures of two other vice chairmen, Edward Shirley and Robert Steele. Werner Geissler, vice chairman of global operations, earned a total of nearly $6.9 million, up from $6.3 million in fiscal 2011. His salary rose $100,000 to $1.045 million. Dimitri Panayotopoulos, vice chairman of global business units, earned $6.9 million, up from nearly $6.3 million. His salary also increased by $100,000, to $1.085 million. The company plans to hold its annual meeting on October 9 in its hometown of Cincinnati. P&G; recommend votes against three shareholder proposals outlined in the filing. The first proposal asks P&G; to begin including a proposal outlining any electioneering and political contributions in its proxy for the annual meeting. The second asks for a report on the feasibility of increasing environmental efforts such as recycling packaging, and the third asks for P&G; to adopt a simple majority vote. P&G; said that most of what was being asked for in the simple majority vote proposal was already implemented.

Ackman disclosed his stake in the maker of Tide laundry detergent and Pampers diapers in July and recently met board members to lay out his complaints about the company.

171,PG,Procter & Gamble CEO defends plan at staid shareholder meeting,"CINCINNATI (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co’s (PG.N) CEO stood behind the company’s plan for increasing profit and sales at a drama-free annual meeting notable for the absence of William Ackman, the activist investor who has pushed hard for change in recent months at the world’s largest maker of household products. Chief Executive Bob McDonald defended the strategy of developing major new products while the company at the same time seeks to cut $10 billion in costs. Tuesday’s meeting, held in P&G;’s hometown of Cincinnati, came as something of a respite for McDonald months after Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management took a stake in P&G;, putting pressure on the CEO and the board to improve performance. McDonald, who has been at the helm since July 2009, is refocusing on core categories, countries and innovations with both the $10 billion restructuring and a strategy laid out in June that homes in on the company’s 40 biggest businesses, 20 biggest new products and 10 key developing markets. Ackman, who disclosed his stake in the maker of Tide detergent and Crest toothpaste too late to have any proposals on the agenda, was not in attendance, and only one shareholder referred to him, asking why it took the investment of an activist to boost P&G;’s stock. “If we remain focused on the plan I talked about, the 40/20/10 plan, with improved innovation from discontinuous innovation, with productivity improvement, then we are all convinced that shareholders will get an increase in value and the stock will reflect that,” McDonald replied, without mentioning Ackman directly. “We are focused like a laser, we are holding our own feet to the fire to do this.” Though Ackman was absent, several of his analysts - who are far less recognizable than the 6-foot, 3-inch hedge fund manager with the shock of gray hair - were in the crowd listening closely. Since Ackman became involved in the stock, P&G;’s board has expressed confidence in the plans laid out by chairman, president and CEO McDonald. The board has publicly backed McDonald, giving the former Army captain time to overhaul the 175-year old company, which is struggling keep up with competitors. Shares of P&G; have risen since Ackman's stake was disclosed but have trailed the gains in the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, of which they are a component, so far this year. All 11 board members, including McDonald, were elected for another year at the meeting. A shareholder proposal on adopting a simple majority vote to pass all such proposals passed, while two other shareholder proposals were defeated. P&G; shares were down 0.6 percent at $68.69 on Tuesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is up 9.3 percent since Ackman’s stake was disclosed in July. PRE-ACKMAN PRESSURE McDonald was under pressure even before news of Ackman’s stake surfaced, after lackluster earnings and the February announcement of the $10 billion restructuring plan that analysts deemed insufficiently transformative. “In our view, management cannot afford to fall short of its promises again, as the clock is ticking on its turnaround,” Morningstar analyst Erin Lash said earlier this month. “It is possible that P&G; could be forced to consider breaking up this household and personal-care behemoth.” Pershing Square is P&G;’s 10th-largest shareholder, with 21.92 million shares, or 0.79 percent of the company’s outstanding shares, according to Thomson Reuters data. Only a week ago in New York, Ackman exerted public pressure on P&G; by answering a few questions about his plans for the company. Ackman met with P&G;’s board in September at the Manhattan office of Kenneth Chenault, the CEO of American Express Co (AXP.N) and a P&G; board member. At that meeting, Ackman did not mince words about what he considered McDonald’s lackluster performance and the aspects that need repair if company performance is to improve. For now, Ackman has left his suggestions with the board. Ackman has been instrumental in shaking up management at Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CP.TO) and retailer J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N). P&G; stumbled in recent months as competitors failed to match some of the price increases it imposed on goods including laundry and dish detergents to mitigate higher commodity costs. The strengthening dollar has also trimmed the value of sales in overseas markets. “The announced restructuring is a direct result of persistent questions about P&G;’s ability to grow profitably,” said Lash. Still, several of the attendees at Tuesday’s event said they stand behind the company and its leader. “They are going in the right direction,” said Bill Harding, an 86-year-old shareholder who lives in Kettering, Ohio, after growing up in Cincinnati. Harding and his wife, Pat, said that they reinvest their dividends in P&G; and still think it is one of the best companies in the country, if not the world.

PRE-ACKMAN PRESSURE McDonald was under pressure even before news of Ackman’s stake surfaced, after lackluster earnings and the February announcement of the $10 billion restructuring plan that analysts deemed insufficiently transformative. “In our view, management cannot afford to fall short of its promises again, as the clock is ticking on its turnaround,” Morningstar analyst Erin Lash said earlier this month. “It is possible that P&G; could be forced to consider breaking up this household and personal-care behemoth.” Pershing Square is P&G;’s 10th-largest shareholder, with 21.92 million shares, or 0.79 percent of the company’s outstanding shares, according to Thomson Reuters data. Only a week ago in New York, Ackman exerted public pressure on P&G; by answering a few questions about his plans for the company. Ackman met with P&G;’s board in September at the Manhattan office of Kenneth Chenault, the CEO of American Express Co and a P&G; board member. At that meeting, Ackman did not mince words about what he considered McDonald’s lackluster performance and the aspects that need repair if company performance is to improve. For now, Ackman has left his suggestions with the board. Ackman has been instrumental in shaking up management at Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd and retailer J.C. Penney Co Inc. P&G; stumbled in recent months as competitors failed to match  some of the price increases it imposed on goods including laundry and dish detergents to mitigate higher commodity costs. The strengthening dollar has also trimmed the value of sales in overseas markets. “The announced restructuring is a direct result of persistent questions about P&G;’s ability to grow profitably,” said Lash. Still, several of the attendees at Tuesday’s event said they stand behind the company and its leader. “They are going in the right direction,” said Bill Harding, an 86-year-old shareholder who lives in Kettering, Ohio, after growing up in Cincinnati. Harding and his wife, Pat, said that they reinvest their dividends in P&G; and still think it is one of the best companies in the country, if not the world.",10092012,http://www.reuters.com/article/procter-meeting/procter-gamble-ceo-defends-plan-at-staid-shareholder-meeting-idUSL1E8L59UO20121009

174,PG,Procter & Gamble's forecast critical to CEO's tenure,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) Chief Executive Bob McDonald’s efforts to fend off activist investor William Ackman are not likely to be helped by the company’s quarterly results this week. The maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors is expected to post its third consecutive decline in revenue and earnings per share when it issues fiscal first-quarter results on October 25. Analysts trimmed their targets when P&G; gave a forecast in August that was below Wall Street’s view. Investors will also be watching for a forecast for the current fiscal second quarter and, less likely, any changes to the full-year forecast for signs that McDonald’s plans for turning the company around are starting to take hold. “If he comes in weak would anybody be surprised that the Bill Ackmans of the world have more power?” said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager at Cincinnati-based Bahl & Gaynor, which manages $7.3 billion, including 4.89 million P&G; shares. P&G; disappointed investors by cutting its fiscal guidance multiple times during fiscal 2012. Analysts have said that McDonald, who has run P&G; since July 2009, may be running out of time to show that his strategy is working. Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management is P&G;’s 10th-largest shareholder, has publicly blamed P&G;’s top brass for high costs and declining revenue while saying that he understands the board wants to give McDonald time to repair years of damage. Ackman met with board members in early September at a meeting in New York, where he laid out his complaints. “I attribute a lot of those problems to senior management,” Ackman said on October 1, adding that it will pay off to wait for “this CEO or the next CEO” to shape up the company. P&G;, which McDonald has admitted lost its footing as its stream of innovation slowed down, is now focused on its 40 biggest businesses, 20 biggest new products and 10 key developing markets. A $10 billion restructuring has led to thousands of job cuts, some even earlier than planned, though some analysts believe P&G; could reduce costs even further. But given the recent history of having to lower its forecasts, setting an overly optimistic one now could just set a trap for later. “They need to set something low so they can hopefully beat it or at least not miss it,” said Caris & Co analyst Linda Bolton Weiser. “They can’t miss guidance, they can’t.” While Ackman could press harder for change at the top, investors at P&G;’s October 9 annual meeting largely backed the CEO. “I’m really proud of you, Mr. McDonald,” investor James Sakelos said during the meeting, held blocks away from P&G;’s headquarters in Cincinnati. “You are doing an excellent job and we do have to be patient.” McDonald, in an unscripted moment during the highly orchestrated event, even got a joke in about P&G;’s share price, which rose after Ackman bought in during the summer. “I have a little stock in P&G;, which I’m thankful (for),” Sakelos said. “Please buy more,” McDonald replied, getting laughs from the crowd. “There was a degree of conviction there that is something that you normally don’t see from Procter people,” said Bahl & Gaynor’s McCormick, who attended the meeting. “The bottom line is a lot of investors are going to be intensely interested in these upcoming results,” he said. “If they are to the upside and exceed expectations people are going to give McDonald the benefit of the doubt for at least another quarter.” Even as P&G;’s 10th-largest shareholder, Ackman’s stake is small. Pershing Square holds 21.92 million shares, or 0.79 percent of the company’s outstanding shares, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average expect P&G; to post sales of $20.77 billion and earnings of 96 cents per share for the fiscal first quarter that ended in September, down from sales of $21.92 billion and earnings of $1.03 per share a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In August, P&G; forecast a profit of 91 cents to 97 cents per share, while analysts at that time had expected a profit of $1.03 per share. Shares of P&G; have risen since Ackman's stake was disclosed in July but have trailed the gains in the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, of which they are a component, so far this year.

The broad S&P; 500 failed to recoup most of its losses from its 3.6 percent decline over the last five sessions. Procter & Gamble shares gained 2.7 percent to $69.92 after the multinational household products manufacturer reported a better-than-expected profit. The Dow component was an outlier, however. With about 244 companies in the S&P; 500 reporting results so far, 62.3 percent have beaten expectations, a slight improvement on the typical 62 percent average, Thomson Reuters data showed. Revenue, on the other hand, remains disappointing, with just 36.3 percent of companies reporting higher-than-expected revenue - compared with a historic beat rate of 62 percent. “We had 50-some companies report today, and it’s all a continuation of companies beating on earnings, but coming in lower on revenue,” said Terry Morris, senior vice president and senior equity manager for National Penn Investors Trust Company in Reading, Pennsylvania. Colgate-Palmolive shares fell 2 percent to $104.41 after the toothpaste and household products manufacturer unveiled a cost-cutting plan that involved shedding 6 percent of its workforce by the end of 2016. U.S. durable goods orders rose more than expected in September, though orders excluding volatile defense goods and aircraft were unchanged and business investment showed signs of stalling. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 9.30 points, or 0.07 percent, at 13,086.64. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was up 3.37 points, or 0.24 percent, at 1,412.12.

The iPad and iPhone maker is expected to report quarterly earnings of $8.75 a share, according to Thomson Reuters data. Apple’s stock lost 0.9 percent to $611.50 ahead of the results. Big-picture uncertainty has also had a quiet dampening effect on stock prices as the countdown to the U.S. presidential election and the impending fiscal cliff begins in earnest. “Certainly, the fiscal cliff continues to weigh on the market.

179,PG,Procter & Gamble earnings give CEO McDonald some relief,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co’s (PG.N) profit rose more than expected, indicating that the world’s largest household products company is making progress in cutting costs and giving Chief Executive Bob McDonald a little relief after months of pressure. Shares of P&G;, the maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors, rose to their highest level in four years. Meanwhile, shares of rival Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) slid as much as 3.3 percent after it announced plans to cut jobs as it strives to operate more nimbly as economies slow in many countries. Colgate’s quarterly profit matched expectations. P&G; is cutting $10 billion of costs and focusing on key markets, products and countries. The company’s goals as well as McDonald, who is also chairman, have been under intense scrutiny since activist investor William Ackman bought shares this summer. “They cleared a low hurdle,” said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. “The fact that they did report solid results is a plus, but I don’t know if the pressure is necessarily off.” P&G; had given a quarterly forecast in August that was below Wall Street’s view at the time, leading analysts to lower their expectations. P&G; ultimately beat the initial analyst expectations, helped by sales that met the high end of its forecast and some relief in commodity costs. Shares of P&G; rose as much as 4 percent to $70.83 on Thursday, their highest level since October 2008. The shares were up 3 percent at $70.11 by midafternoon. Colgate’s shares were down 1.9 percent at $104.49 in the afternoon, off an earlier low at $103.06. “It wouldn’t surprise me if we’re seeing some people saying it is time to sell some Colgate, buy some Procter, given Colgate’s outperformance year to date,” said JP Morgan analyst John Faucher, who has a “neutral” rating on Colgate and an “overweight” rating on P&G.; Several consumer goods makers are trimming jobs, including P&G;, as concerned consumers hold off on some purchases and growth slows in major markets such as China. P&G; is on track to cut 4,200 jobs by the end of October on its way to eliminating 5,700 jobs by the end of its fiscal year. Colgate’s plans, including moving away from single-country units toward regional hubs, should lead the toothpaste maker to trim about 2,300 jobs, or roughly 6 percent of its workforce, by the end of 2016. On Wednesday, Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N) said it would eliminate 1,300 to 1,500 jobs as it leaves some low-margin businesses in Europe, and Energizer Holdings Inc (ENR.N) said in September that it plans to cut an unspecified number of jobs. Colgate’s shares had risen 15 percent this year through Wednesday, while P&G; shares were up less than 1 percent. P&G; did not raise its key profit forecast for the fiscal year that began in September, in part because it plans to ramp up marketing support behind new products being introduced later in the year, and because it has to spend more to obtain an absorbent material for Pampers diapers, its largest brand, following a plant explosion in Japan. P&G; earned $1.06 per share in the fiscal first quarter on a “core” basis, which excludes charges, up from $1.01 per share a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected it to earn 96 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Back in August, before P&G; forecast earnings per share of 91 to 97 cents, analysts’ average forecast had been $1.03. Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management is P&G;’s 10th-largest shareholder, has publicly blamed P&G;’s top brass for high costs and declining revenue while saying that he understands the board wants to give McDonald time to repair years of damage. Ackman could not be reached for comment on Thursday. P&G; is putting a fresh focus on productivity, including adding a new global officer of productivity and organization transformation who will report to McDonald, as well as creating a productivity council of senior managers. P&G;’s net sales in the quarter fell 4 percent to $20.74 billion, below analysts’ target of $20.78 billion. Organic sales, which strip out the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, rose 2 percent. P&G; is still seeing some pressure. Its sales grew 7 percent in China, but that was below China’s household-products market growth of 11 percent. China is P&G;’s second-largest market in terms of sales and profit. P&G; still expects to post core earnings per share of $3.80 to $4 this fiscal year. Analysts’ average forecast for the year is $3.91 per share. For the current second quarter, P&G; forecast core earnings of $1.07 to $1.13 per share, with organic sales up 1 to 3 percent. Analysts’ forecast was $1.10. Colgate, meanwhile, earned $1.38 per share, matching analysts’ forecasts, while sales fell 1 percent to $4.33 billion. P&G; is dealing with the explosion in Japan of a Nippon Shokubai Co (4114.T) plant that supplies a key material for Pampers diapers. Pampers is the company’s largest single brand, accounting for more than $10 billion in annual sales. Nippon Shokubai is one of the world’s biggest makers of acrylic acid, the main ingredient of a resin called SAP, which is used in diapers. P&G; has found other sources of the material and while any impact to consumers should be “minor,” it has to spend more obtain the supplies it needs, said Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller. Kimberly-Clark, which makes Huggies diapers, said on Wednesday it was not affected by the explosion since Nippon Shokubai was not its supplier.

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said China’s factory output should grow faster in the last three months of 2012 than in the third quarter, raising hopes the world’s second largest economy may avoid a hard landing to its slowdown. Data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell by 23,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 369,000, in a clearer sign the labor market is healing after wild fluctuations in claims data earlier in the month. Separately, a gauge of planned U.S. business spending was flat in September, a sign that heightened uncertainty is weighing on factories, but new orders for long-lasting manufactured goods increased during the month. The benchmark S&P; index had shed 3.6 percent over the prior five sessions, its worst performance since mid-May, and is down 3.4 percent from its closing high of Sept. 14, amid weak earnings outlooks and top-line revenue misses by large multinational companies. “The selloff has been about earnings, the next couple of weeks are still going to be about earnings and there is some concern about revenue - the first thing you have to do is stop going down so maybe that is what we’ve done right here today,” said Frank Lesh, a futures analyst and broker at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. “The data is good, it’s definitely looking the right way and any news out of China helps too. They are a concern so any news that they are looking better is good for us, too.” Procter & Gamble Co jumped 3.6 percent to $70.55 as the top boost to the Dow after it reported a quarterly profit and maintained its key earnings forecast for the year as the world’s largest household products maker cut costs and narrowed its focus on key markets, products and countries. A total of 56 S&P; 500 companies are due to report earnings on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters data, including Apple , Amazon and Eastman Chemical Co. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 61.24 points, or 0.47 percent, to 13,138.58. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 7.66 points, or 0.54 percent, to 1,416.41. The Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 13.51 points, or 0.45 percent, to 2,995.21. With results in from 186 of the S&P; 500 companies, 59.1 percent have beat analysts’ expectations, below the 62 percent long-term average, according to Thomson Reuters data through Wednesday. Revenue figures have been more disappointing, with just 38.2 percent of companies exceeding analysts’ expectations, while 61.8 percent have fallen short. In a typical quarter, 62 percent of companies beat estimates. The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in September, gained 0.3 percent to 99.5, below expectations for a 2.1 percent rise, but the data indicated an improving tone in the housing market.

P&G; also said it may increase stock repurchases to $6 billion from $4 billion, but said such additional buybacks should not have a big impact on earnings per share. The company maintained the forecasts for sales and earnings for the current quarter and the fiscal year it had given in late October. P&G; remains on track to eliminate about 5,700 non-manufacturing jobs by the end of this fiscal year, which will end in June. It now plans to reduce another 2 percent to 4 percent of its non-manufacturing jobs each year during fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016. “These are all continued steps in the right direction, but we wish they had taken bolder ones like even more aggressive cost-cutting,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj, who attended P&G;’s bi-annual analyst meeting at the company’s Cincinnati headquarters on Thursday. Shares of P&G;, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, were down 0.2 percent at $66.38 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers has been working for months to improve its structure and cut costs. It has admitted that recent innovations were not as strong as successes from years past such as Swiffer and Crest Whitestrips. “The reality is that the pace of our disruptive innovation has slowed over the past decade,” said Jorge Mesquita, P&G;’s group president of new business creation and innovation and global pet care. P&G; did not outline exactly where it plans to cut jobs but it would like to trim more positions in developed markets than in developing ones, where it has “significant growth opportunity,” Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told reporters after the meeting. “We realize that we can’t get the next round of productivity just from squeezing harder, we need to really look at our organization’s design,” he said, adding that P&G; will maintain a strong presence in Cincinnati. Competitors such as Kimberly-Clark Corp and Colgate-Palmolive Co are also trimming their ranks as the industry contends with weak economic conditions in major markets such as the United States and Western Europe. Some industry watchers have suggested that P&G; consider splitting up, separating its beauty businesses from mainstays such as diapers, paper goods and detergent. However, P&G; contends that its scale, including more than two dozen brands that each generate more than $1 billion in annual sales, is an advantage. During the meeting, P&G; highlighted some success it has had in emerging markets, such as seeing the Indian diaper category increase fivefold since it started selling Pampers there five years ago. At the same time it is promoting lower-priced items, including Gain and Era detergents, to attract cost-conscious U.S. shoppers it has lost to rivals such as Church & Dwight Co Inc, known for its ARM & HAMMER products. P&G; has been under pressure to show improvement following the investment of activist investor William Ackman, who may want to see P&G; Chairman and Chief Executive Bob McDonald pushed out of his job. Even before Ackman’s involvement, P&G; was proceeding with that $10 billion restructuring and other changes. McDonald spoke only at the beginning and end of P&G;’s meeting on Thursday, allowing Moeller and 11 others to address the crowd, showcasing the company’s strategy and its deep bench of long-time executives. When P&G; unveiled a plan to cut $10 billion in costs over five years back in February, it said $6 billion in savings would come from its cost of goods. Now, as it tweaks product formulations, works with local suppliers and takes other steps to trim costs, it should see more than $6 billion in such savings, said Global Product Supply Officer Yannis Skoufalos. The company said it expects to deliver annual improvement of 5 percent in its manufacturing operations, measured by the number of cases of products produced per person, per year. Back on Oct. 25, a better-than-expected quarterly report drove P&G; shares to their highest level in four years. P&G; stood by the forecasts that it gave at that time, calling for core earnings per share of $1.07 to $1.13 in the current second quarter and $3.80 to $4 this fiscal year. It still expects organic sales, which strip out the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, to rise 1 to 3 percent this quarter and 2 to 4 percent this year. On Wednesday, Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management disclosed that it raised its combined stake in P&G; by 27.4 percent to 27.9 million shares as of Sept. 30, while Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reduced its holdings 11.4 percent to 52.79 million shares.",11152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/procter-meeting/update-3-pg-set-to-cut-more-jobs-repurchase-additional-shares-idUSL1E8MF3VF20121115

194,PG,California fight tests U.S. states' compact on business taxes,"(Reuters) - A landmark agreement forged 45 years ago to make corporate taxation more uniform among U.S. states is at the center of a court fight between California and Gillette Co, potentially leading to more tax conflict between states and big businesses. Gillette, the razor giant owned by Ohio-based Procter & Gamble Co, wants to be able to use the 1967 Multistate Tax Compact (MTC) to determine how much tax it owes California. This would cut Gillette’s 1997-2004 tax bill by more than $4 million. The company is seeking a rebate of taxes already paid. California wants Gillette to abide by more recent tax rules the state has written and, as a result of the dispute, has withdrawn from the MTC, reducing its membership to 18 states and raising questions about the compact’s future. At a time of tight state budgets, the case is being closely watched across the country. Early next year, the California Supreme Court will decide whether to take the case under review. Whether or not it does, more litigation is expected. A victory for Gillette in California - which has by far the largest economy among the 50 states - could unleash $750 million in new California tax rebate claims, according to the state. Similar disputes involving other companies are pending in Michigan, Oregon and Texas. Experts expect more states to become involved next year. The case dates to January 2010. That was when Gillette and other companies filed claims saying California, as an MTC member, must honor the MTC formula for apportioning state taxes, and not impose its own formula. The claims were consolidated. The other companies were Kimberly-Clark Corp, Sigma-Aldrich Corp, RB Holdings, Jones Apparel Group and Procter & Gamble, Gillette’s parent since 2005. They argued that under the MTC, their tax bills, with interest, would be $34 million less than under California’s math. The state went to court and prevailed at trial in San Francisco Superior Court, but then lost before the State Court of Appeals in July. In November, the state’s Franchise Tax Board appealed to the California Supreme Court to hear the case. In finding for Gillette, the appeals court ruled that the compact was a binding obligation on California which subsequent legislation did not erase. Only California’s withdrawal from the compact would do that, the court said. The state dropped out of the MTC in June, an action that could protect it from future claims. But if other states follow California’s lead, seeking to avoid trouble from companies testing the Gillette approach, MTC membership would shrink, potentially ushering in a newly fragmented system pitting states against corporate taxpayers a case at a time. Joe Huddleston, executive director of the Washington-based Multistate Tax Commission, an interstate group created 45 years ago to administer the compact, said the principles of state tax cooperation remain strong. But he predicted the Gillette case would have broad implications. Forged to promote equitable apportionment of tax dollars among states, the MTC represented an effort by states to ensure that companies operating in multiple states not pay tax on the same income to more than one state. Tax consistency was seen as a benefit both to states, which used the compact to fight off federal intervention on the topic, and to multistate companies seeking fair taxation. The MTC includes a formula whereby companies place equal weight on their property, payroll and sales in a given state when calculating how much tax they owe there. In the years since 1967, many states, including California, have moved away from the MTC formula. To favor and attract businesses within their borders, these states have rearranged the way they tax business income so that in-state businesses pay less and out-of-state businesses pay more, explained University of Connecticut Law School Professor Richard Pomp. Annette Nellen, professor of accounting and finance at San Jose State University, said the change is an example of how the state has used the tax code as an economic development tool. In California, the state’s recent rules added up to millions of dollars in additional costs for the companies involved in the Gillette case. All of them are based outside of California. The California Franchise Tax Board declined to answer questions about the case or the claim that its formula benefits local companies. It cited a policy of not discussing pending litigation. Gillette and Procter & Gamble both declined comment on the litigation, as well. The MTC is one of more than 200 compacts in force among the 50 states. The tax compact takes in nearly every state in one form or another. With California’s withdrawal in June, the compact now includes 18 states and the District of Columbia as full members. Another 23 states are associate members and attend meetings and in some cases take part in other programs, such as joint taxpayer audits. Six other states support the MTC’s purpose, but are not participating members. The case is Gillette Co & Subsidiaries v. California Franchise Tax Board, Supreme Court of the State of California Case No. S206587.

195,PG,IOC eyes new sponsor after London success,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee is planning to add a new sponsor in 2013 to replace computer manufacturer Acer, taking advantage of a favorable climate created by the London 2012 Olympics, the IOC’s marketing chief said. “The London 2012 Games were an absolute great success both for organizers and for the sponsors and it makes it easier to talk to companies after London,” Gerhard Heiberg, head of the IOC’s marketing commission, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. Despite the economic downturn, London managed to balance its books with sponsorship deals and record revenues from ticket sales, Games organizers said in November. Heiberg said the new sponsor would not necessarily have to be a computer company and instead reflect the changing electronics trends. “We have plans and we are looking at that (computing) category and I hope to see the deal within the year. There are some possibilities with PC producers or some other companies to expand the category a little bit,” he said. “There are developments in this technical category. You have producers of TVs, PCs and other IT gadgets. There is such a revolution here.” The new sponsor will push the IOC’s top sponsor program revenues for the period 2013-2016 above the $1 billion mark for the first time. In comparison, the same program was worth $663 million for the period 2001-4. The organization has already secured more than $720 million from sponsors for the 2017-2020 quadrennium from just seven companies. “Yes, we are on track for that (one billion dollar) target,” Heiberg said, adding they were also looking to add one more company apart from the electronics partner. “We have had some talks with possible newcomers and if we find the right company it could start immediately. We are looking at categories for this.” He did not say what category would accommodate another sponsor. The IOC currently has 10 top sponsors signed up to the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, including technology firms Samsung and Panasonic, and has set a maximum limit of 12 sponsors. Heiberg said adding more than 12 companies would “dilute” their sponsorship concept which is expected to be tweaked after 2020, the cut-off date for any long-term deals. “We do not want any more sponsors than 12. We stick to that. 2020 is also the limit (for contracts),” he said. “We are working possibly on a new concept and looking at what are the advantages and disadvantages. But we have enough time for that,” said the Norwegian, who was head of the 1994 Lillehammer winter Olympics. Russia’s Sochi will play host to the 2014 Winter Olympics while Rio will become the first South American city to stage the summer Games in 2016. South Korea’s Pyeongchang will host the 2018 winter Olympics while the 2020 host city will be elected in September with Istanbul, Tokyo and Madrid in the running.

196,PG,Procter & Gamble to lay off 150 in Spain and Portugal,"MADRID, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble is cutting around 150 jobs in Spain and Portugal following the decision to integrate hygiene company Arbora & Ausonia (A&A;) into its existing operations. P&G;, which makes a host of well-known household products from prescription drugs to Fairy washing-up liquid, has already said it would lay off thousands of workers worldwide in a cost-cutting plan designed to reinvigorate its performance. P&G; acquired 100 percent of A&A;, which makes nappies, Tampax tampons and adult incontinence products, last year after food company Agrolimen sold its 50 percent stake in the firm. A succession of companies in Spain are slashing jobs in response to a painful recession. Airline Iberia plans to cut up to 4,500 posts, while 12,000 banking jobs are expected to go this year. Economic growth is not expected until 2014 in Spain, where one in four of the workforce is jobless. P&G; said the plan focused on 300 jobs at A&A;’s main offices in Barcelona and Lisbon and in its sales networks. The company - which employs a total of around 2,500 in Spain - said it expected to offer new jobs for around 150 workers, while the rest would be dismissed. A&A;’s plants in the Spanish towns of Montornes, Mequinenza and Jijona would carry on operating without significant changes to their structure, P&G; said in a statement. A&A; has sales of more than 500 million euros ($665 million)in Spain and 100 million in Portugal. P&G; reports results on Jan. 25, when it will likely update on its restructuring efforts.

197,PG,"P&G; posts solid quarter, gives CEO more breathing room","(Reuters) - What a difference a year makes for Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) and CEO Bob McDonald. Last February, he unveiled a $10 billion restructuring including thousands of job cuts after the world’s largest household products company admitted it was not nimble enough, especially in emerging markets. In April, Wall Street analysts roasted McDonald on a conference call after P&G;’s latest profit warning and having to rescind some price increases. The dour performance prompted activist investor Bill Ackman to call for change last summer when he bought the shares. Since then, McDonald has refocused the world’s largest household products maker on winning back market share for products ranging from Gillette razors to Tide detergent. On Friday, Procter & Gamble delivered its strongest indication yet that its turnaround efforts are paying off, posting a better-than-expected profit and improved forecasts, helped by U.S. hits such as Tide Pods and new hair care products under the Vidal Sassoon brand. The results and rosy outlook - it was the first time the company raised its annual profit forecast since April 2010 - led to a 4 percent rise in P&G;’s stock price, setting a high for McDonald’s 3-1/2 year tenure. Even Ackman, who for months has blamed McDonald’s team for earlier missteps, said on CNBC that the results were an indication of “very significant progress.” Friday’s report showed better-than-expected profit, helped in part by a gain from an acquisition, and sales that surpassed expectations, with growth in all divisions. Even so, some analysts think the company still has more to accomplish. “The results are pretty good, but you know what? We know we’re not done yet, we know this is work in progress, we know we have more to do,” McDonald said in an interview. P&G;’s long-term goals, along with cutting costs and developing more innovative products, include getting sales to grow 1 to 2 percentage points ahead of the market pace. “They’ve been stuck in the mud for years, and this is kind of a ray of hope for the company and they should be commended on the quarter,” said Channing Smith, co-manager of the Capital Advisors Growth Fund (CIAOX.O). P&G; represents 2 percent of that fund and the firm overall holds roughly 75,000 shares of P&G.; It has taken P&G; months to reignite growth in sluggish markets such as the United States while also expanding in emerging markets, where products are typically less expensive. P&G; expects Tide Pods, the single-dose detergent launched in the United States in 2012, to become a $500 million brand this year. It says the premium-priced product is attracting both loyal Tide users and those who used to buy less expensive brands. Tide Pods will be followed by an Ariel-branded version of the product in Europe this spring. Other launches this year include updated Pantene and Vidal Sassoon hair care products, as well as new versions of Bounty paper towels. Last summer, Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management bought P&G;’s shares and began pushing for more change. While results have improved since then, P&G;’s growth still lags that of peers such as Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS). P&G;’s organic sales, which strip out the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange, grew 3 percent last quarter, while Unilever’s sales rose 6.9 percent. P&G;’s rivals such as Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) and Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N) have done well in recent years while Procter struggled, and now perhaps it has the firepower to bounce back, said Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo. “Procter’s been left out of the party a little bit, so it’s nice to see them reappear here and kind of exert their influence on the group,” he said. Ackman’s Pershing Square has a 1.02 percent stake in P&G;, making it the company’s eighth-largest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. Ackman said in the fall he understood the board wanted to give McDonald more time to repair years of damage. “When the company is performing, obviously the pressure from Ackman will probably fade somewhat,” said Capital Advisors’ Smith, adding that while he does not know Ackman’s intentions, it is clear that Ackman’s investment in P&G; is worth a lot more today than when he bought the shares. Ackman spoke about P&G; on CNBC on Friday, saying that over the last three years it “certainly looked like” McDonald was not the right person for the job. He added, “if the company can make dramatic progress - and I think this quarter is an indication of very significant progress - then I hope that Bob can be successful and can make it.” McDonald did not say whether he has spoken with Ackman lately, but said he considers it a great honor to lead P&G;, which he joined in 1980. “I’m totally focused on doing what I have to do,” he said. Even before Ackman took a stake, P&G; was going through a $10 billion restructuring and other changes. It cut 5,500 nonmanufacturing jobs through December, near its goal of reducing 5,700 positions by the end of June. Competitors such as Colgate and Kimberly-Clark are also trimming their ranks. Meanwhile, rival Kimberly-Clark also posted a better-than-expected profit on Friday. P&G; has seen U.S. volume growth continue in January, said Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller. At the same time, it believes it can improve market share in Europe over the next few months. Some analysts still see room for improvement. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Astrachan called the results “solid and encouraging,” particularly the sales growth, but said P&G; still lags in categories with strong growth trends, such as beauty. P&G; earned $4.06 billion, or $1.39 per share, in the fiscal second quarter ended in December, up from $1.69 billion, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier. Stripping out unusual items such as restructuring charges and acquisitions, P&G; earned $1.22 per share. That topped the company’s own forecast of $1.07 to $1.13 per share and analysts’ average target of $1.11, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 2 percent to $22.18 billion, topping analysts’ forecast of $21.91 billion. P&G; expects fiscal 2013 core earnings of $3.97 to $4.07 per share, up from an earlier forecast of $3.80 to $4. Analyst estimates were at the bottom of that new range. It expects organic sales to rise 3 to 4 percent this year, narrowing a prior forecast of 2 to 4 percent growth. P&G; also said it now plans to repurchase $5 billion to $6 billion in stock after calling for $4 billion to $6 billion in buybacks. For the current quarter, P&G; forecast core earnings per share of 91 to 97 cents, with sales up 3 to 4 percent. Analysts’ average forecast was 95 cents per share. Shares of P&G; ended 4 percent higher at $73.25, the highest closing price since September 2008.

P&G;’s organic sales, which strip out the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange, grew 3 percent last quarter, while Unilever’s sales rose 6.9 percent. P&G;’s rivals such as Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive Co  and Kimberly-Clark Corp have done well in recent years while Procter struggled, and now perhaps it has the firepower to bounce back, said Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo. “Procter’s been left out of the party a little bit, so it’s nice to see them reappear here and kind of exert their influence on the group,” he said. Ackman’s Pershing Square has a 1.02 percent stake in P&G;, making it the company’s eighth-largest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. Ackman said in the fall he understood the board wanted to give McDonald more time to repair years of damage. “When the company is performing, obviously the pressure from Ackman will probably fade somewhat,” said Capital Advisors’ Smith, adding that while he does not know Ackman’s intentions, it is clear that Ackman’s investment in P&G; is worth a lot more today than when he bought the shares. Ackman spoke about P&G; on CNBC on Friday, saying that over the last three years it “certainly looked like” McDonald was not the right person for the job. He added, “if the company can make dramatic progress - and I think this quarter is an indication of very significant progress - then I hope that Bob can be successful and can make it.” McDonald did not say whether he has spoken with Ackman lately, but said he considers it a great honor to lead P&G;, which he joined in 1980. “I’m totally focused on doing what I have to do,” he said. Even before Ackman took a stake, P&G; was going through a $10 billion restructuring and other changes. It cut 5,500 nonmanufacturing jobs through December, near its goal of reducing 5,700 positions by the end of June. Competitors such as Colgate and Kimberly-Clark are also trimming their ranks. Meanwhile, rival Kimberly-Clark also posted a better-than-expected profit on Friday. P&G; has seen U.S. volume growth continue in January, said Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller. At the same time, it believes it can improve market share in Europe over the next few months. Some analysts still see room for improvement. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Astrachan called the results “solid and encouraging,” particularly the sales growth, but said P&G; still lags in categories with strong growth trends, such as beauty. P&G; earned $4.06 billion, or $1.39 per share, in the fiscal second quarter ended in December, up from $1.69 billion, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier. Stripping out unusual items such as restructuring charges and acquisitions, P&G; earned $1.22 per share. That topped the company’s own forecast of $1.07 to $1.13 per share and analysts’ average target of $1.11, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 2 percent to $22.18 billion, topping analysts’ forecast of $21.91 billion. P&G; expects fiscal 2013 core earnings of $3.97 to $4.07 per share, up from an earlier forecast of $3.80 to $4. Analyst estimates were at the bottom of that new range. It expects organic sales to rise 3 to 4 percent this year, narrowing a prior forecast of 2 to 4 percent growth. P&G; also said it now plans to repurchase $5 billion to $6 billion in stock after calling for $4 billion to $6 billion in buybacks. For the current quarter, P&G; forecast core earnings per share of 91 to 97 cents, with sales up 3 to 4 percent. Analysts’ average forecast was 95 cents per share. Shares of P&G; ended 4 percent higher at $73.25, the highest closing price since September 2008.

207,PG,Germany fines consumer goods firms in information-sharing probe,"FRANKFURT, March 18 (Reuters) - Germany’s cartel office said it would fine a number of consumer goods companies 39 million euros ($51 million), including L’Oreal and Procter & Gamble in Germany, for taking part in anti-competitive sharing of information. The cartel office said the companies had shared information between 2004 and 2006 during working groups on personal care, laundry and cleaning products. The information exchanged included upcoming price increases, discounts demanded by retailers and negotiations with retailers. The probe was triggered by Colgate-Palmolive, which escaped fines for its role as whistleblower. The watchdog had already fined nine companies a total of 24 million euros as part of the same investigation in 2008 and 2011. The companies also fined on Monday were Beiersdorf , the German units of Gillette - also part of P&G; - and GlaxoSmithKline, as well as Erdal-Rex GmbH. The Markenverband association of German brands, which ran the regular working groups, was also fined for supporting the exchange of information. L’Oreal and P&G; both said they would appeal the decision. “L’Oreal Germany did not take part in any anti-competitive exchange of information,” the company said in a statement. A P&G; spokeswoman said one of the company’s key principles was to work within the letter of the law wherever it operated. GlaxoSmithKline in Germany and Erdal-Rex, which makes cleaning products under the Frosch brand, were not immediately available for comment. The Markenverband association said it would review the decision before deciding whether to appeal. Beiersdorf has already agreed a settlement with the authorities and so cannot appeal. Those companies previously fined as part of the same investigation include Henkel and Reckitt Benckiser .",3182013,http://www.reuters.com/article/germany-consumerproducts-fine/germany-fines-consumer-goods-firms-in-information-sharing-probe-idUSL6N0CAFTD20130318
208,PG,"UPDATE 1-P&G; invests $450 mln in new, better African plants","* To invest $175 million in new plant in South Africa * Work on a $200 mln plant in Nigeria underway By Tiisetso Motsoeneng JOHANNESBURG, March 19 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co. , the world’s biggest household products maker, is spending $450 million upgrading and building new factories in Africa, the latest multinational to position itself for take-off on the fast-growing continent. The bulk of the money is being spent in South Africa, where the firm plans to build a 1.6 billion rand ($175 million) plant next year, and in Nigeria, where it is in the middle of constructing a $200 million baby-care products facility. Africa has been in the limelight for global consumer firms since Wal-Mart’s $2.4 billion acquisition in 2011 of South African retailer Massmart gave the world’s largest retailer a foothold in several sub-Saharan countries. P&G;, which already makes nappies for South Africa in a factory near Johannesburg, said the new factory in Africa’s biggest economy would make products such as detergents for the local market and export to southern and east Africa. Construction of the facility, which the company said would be among its biggest in Africa and Europe, would start next year, with production expected by 2017. “Sub-Saharan Africa is the fastest growing region for our business,” said Michael Yates, one of P&G;’s top officials in the region. Yates also said a factory in Nigeria’s Ogun state, 200 km (130 miles) outside Lagos, was expected to start production in the next year. P&G; is also upgrading its factory in Morocco, Yates said. Global consumer goods companies want their products on the shelves of retailers such Shoprite which have laid out aggressive plans for store openings across the continent of a billion people. However, Shoprite - Africa’s largest retailer - and rivals Massmart and Pick n Pay have been slower to put their plans into action due to a lack of shopping malls in most of the continent. P&G;’s expansion plans pit it against South African firm Tiger Brands and Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company Unilever, which has said it wants to double its Africa revenue in the next few years.

210,PG,"P&G; taking longer to pay suppliers, offers financing","(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) is increasing the time it takes to pay for supplies and offering financing to help mitigate the impact a longer payment cycle could have on small and midsize businesses, the household products maker told suppliers earlier this month.

214,PG,"P&G;'s product push to weigh on profit, shares fall","(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) said on Wednesday that profit would fall more than Wall Street anticipated this quarter as it increases spending to promote several new products. The news spooked investors who do not want to wait until 2014 for better sales increases. Shares of the world’s largest household products maker fell as much as 6 percent after closing at an all-time high of $82.54 on Tuesday. “There’s a lot of frustration that they’ve been talking about a lot of actions they’ve been taking but we haven’t really seen an acceleration in the sales growth,” said David Blount, co-portfolio manager of the Growth & Income Fund at Eagle Asset Management, which includes P&G; shares. The company, maker of Pampers diapers, Gillette razors and many other products, has been under greater scrutiny to improve after cutting profit expectations in the past and learning that activist investor Bill Ackman invested in the stock. Cincinnati-based P&G; also posted a fiscal third-quarter profit on Wednesday that topped estimates despite sales that were weaker than both the company and analysts had anticipated. Chief Executive Bob McDonald was roasted by analysts on a conference call a year ago when P&G; gave a profit warning. While Wednesday’s call was not as tense, analysts wanted to know why the company has not yet posted better sales growth more than a year into its turnaround. P&G;, which announced a $10 billion restructuring in February 2012, said that its push for more innovation means that several products such as new Iams pet foods and Olay skin creams will soon hit stores. After cutting billions of dollars in costs, along with eliminating hundreds of more jobs than anticipated, it will now spend more to promote those new goods and even to build the plants to produce them around the world. FOURTH-QUARTER FORECAST For the current fourth quarter ending in June, P&G; said profit should fall to 69 cents to 77 cents per share, while analysts expected it to earn 81 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. P&G; earned 82 cents per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The company cited factors including weak market growth, higher marketing and other costs and volatility in Venezuela, Argentina, Egypt, Syria and South Korea. Wednesday’s fiscal third-quarter results were a sharp departure from the fiscal second quarter, when P&G; raised its annual profit forecast and its shares jumped. On Wednesday, on the heels of the better-than-expected third quarter profit, it raised only the bottom end of its annual forecast range by 2 cents per share. “They’re still making progress, they’re still on the right track, it is just going to be a little more slowly than what people expected,” said Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo. P&G; insists that its forecast is “realistic, not conservative,” especially given the headwinds it faces such as volatility in Venezuela and elsewhere, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told analysts. Along with spending on marketing to promote its new products, P&G; is dealing with what it calls a “choppy” economic recovery, and sees a 1 to 2 percent impact on its sales this year from foreign exchange rates. Its shares slid as low as $77.48 on Wednesday and were last trading down 4.7 percent at $78.05, wiping out nearly all of this month’s gains. Shares of rivals such as Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) and Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N) were down less than 2 percent. While products such as single-dose Tide Pods laundry detergent have boosted U.S. sales, P&G; said it still needs to figure out the formula for getting products such as Pantene shampoo and Olay skin creams to stand out among competitors. Net sales decreased in the hair care and skin care business in the latest quarter. P&G; is taking the right steps by cutting costs, bringing out new products and growing in developing markets, but it is important for it to show progress in the beauty unit in the next quarter or two, said Russo. P&G; said it earned 99 cents per share on a core basis in the quarter ended in March, topping analysts’ target of 96 cents. Core earnings exclude items such as restructuring charges. Overall sales rose 2 percent to $20.598 billion while analysts were looking for sales of $20.73 billion. The company had forecast 3 to 4 percent in sales growth. P&G;’s organic sales, which strip out the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange changes, grew 3 percent - at the low end of its forecast of 3 to 4 percent. On a net basis, the company earned $2.57 billion, or 88 cents per share, in the fiscal third quarter. That was up from $2.41 billion, or 82 cents per share, a year earlier. McDonald declined to comment on any discussions he may have been having with Ackman, who is known to push for change at companies in which he invests. Ackman’s Pershing Square had a 1.02 percent stake in P&G;, or 27.95 million shares, as of December, making it P&G;’s eighth-largest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. P&G; said it now plans to repurchase $6 billion of its stock this year, at the high end of its prior forecast for $5 billion to $6 billion in buybacks. Last June, P&G; decided to hold off on buybacks, but in August quickly reverted back to its usual plan. P&G; also said it had cut 6,250 jobs as of March 31, ahead of its goal to cut 5,700 jobs by the end of June.

Traders said P&G; was paying 98 euros ($130) per share for half of Maxingvest’s 50.47 percent stake. A spokesman for Maxingvest said it did not comment on market rumours. No one at Beiersdorf and P&G; Germany were immediately available for comment. P&G; has made no secret of the fact that it finds Beiersdorf an interesting company and persistent bid speculation has helped keep the Beiersdorf share price high.

Lafley, who will celebrate his 66th birthday in June, said P&G;’s board asked him days, not weeks, ago to come back, but he did not say exactly when he got the call.

235,PG,Analysis: P&G; all-star board's oversight questioned as CEO departs,"(Reuters) - The sudden exit of Procter & Gamble Co’s (PG.N) Bob McDonald as chief executive and the return of former CEO A.G. Lafley in his place has raised questions about the vigilance of one of America’s highest-profile corporate boards. On paper at least, P&G;, the maker of a myriad of household products such as Crest toothpaste and Tide detergent, has one of the strongest boards in the world with CEOs from six other companies among its 12 members, including three from companies in the Dow Jones industrial average. The CEOs include Boeing Co’s (BA.N) James McNerney, Hewlett-Packard Co’s (HPQ.N) Meg Whitman, American Express Co (AXP.N) CEO Kenneth Chenault, and Macy’s Inc CEO (M.N) Terry Lundgren. P&G; in its annual proxy statement to shareholders last year described the board as “highly qualified and each Director brings a diversity of skills and experiences.” It said all of the directors - who also include Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) CEO Patricia Woertz, Frontier Communications Corp (FTR.O) CEO Maggie Wilderotter and former Mexico President Ernesto Zedillo - qualify as possessing “extraordinary leadership qualities and are able to identify and develop leadership qualities in others.” But some investors and corporate governance experts say that having so many powerful directors could also be a weakness because serving CEOs are under a lot of pressure in their own jobs and therefore cannot commit much time to being a director of another company. They also suggest that major P&G; investors, such as Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N)(which had a P&G; stake of about 2 percent at the end of March), and activist hedge fund investor Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management (with around 1 percent), would also have more at stake than the CEOs, who only have modest P&G; shareholdings. While boards in corporate America are often dominated by current and retired executives, many also have investors represented - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), for example, has Buffett’s son Howard Buffett on its board (Berkshire has a 9 percent stake). The lack of big investors on the board is a concern, said Frank Feather, chairman of Toronto-based corporate strategy consulting company Geodevco. There should be some directors who own significant amounts of shares that were not paid for or issued to them by the company. “Directors should have skin in the game,” he said. Added Urmi Ashar, who founded the Pittsburgh chapter of the National Association of Corporate Directors and teaches governance at Carnegie Mellon University: “The heavyweight board of P&G; packed with CEOs is a definite red flag and it leaves one wondering how much time they have to dedicate to the challenges at P&G.;” Whitman, for example, has been trying to engineer a turnaround at HP, following a failed acquisition by her predecessor and amid a struggling personal computer market. Meanwhile, McNerney has faced a crisis at Boeing after overheating batteries grounded its new Dreamliner aircraft since January, with flights only now resuming. Still, their attendance record - and that of other directors - for P&G; board meetings last year was strong. And several of the CEOs, including Whitman and Lundgren, weren’t on the board when McDonald was appointed in June 2009. Also giving a CEO a reasonable period - just under four years in McDonald’s case - to produce results would be pretty standard at most major companies unless the share price was imploding. All the board members contacted for this article either declined to comment or were not available, including McNerney, who holds the title of presiding director at P&G.; The presiding director, among other things, oversees director meetings when management is not present. A P&G; spokesman declined to comment. Even Ackman, who had been pushing for McDonald to be replaced, in October described the board as “one of the best” in America. He declined to comment for this article. It is still unclear what finally triggered McDonald’s retirement, which was announced late last Thursday, and P&G; has declined to answer questions. The company disappointed investors last month when it said that earnings in the current quarter would be lower than Wall Street expected but on Friday P&G; Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told analysts on a brief call that the CEO change would not lead to a strategy change and was “not indicative of any kind of bigger problem or financial issue. Still, its share price did underperform between the time McDonald was appointed in June 2009 and the announcement of his departure. Its shares have risen about 50 percent in that time but that is less than the gains achieved by major consumer products rivals over the same span: Unilever Plc's (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS) shares are up 85-93 percent depending on which listing is cited, Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) up 74 percent and Clorox Co (CLX.N) gained 60 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX advanced 75 percent in that period. The debate over the suitability of outside CEOs for boards dates back decades, but reviews on their effectiveness are mixed. A 2011 review of research by Stanford University academics found that while in theory CEOs should bring the leadership qualities and expertise that boards need, no research had found they are in fact better board members. Some investors also questioned why the P&G; board had to turn to a retired CEO to return to the helm, and didn’t have a more robust CEO succession policy in place. Bringing back Lafley “highlights poor succession planning by the board,” said Jason Tauber, a research analyst with the Large Cap Disciplined Growth team at Neuberger Berman, which holds 8.7 million P&G; shares. One of the problems was that a previously deep bench in management ranks at P&G; has been depleted since McDonald became CEO in 2009. When a new CEO takes over, some departures of other top executives are often inevitable as they go elsewhere to fulfill their ambitions of running a company but in P&G;’s case the losses were perhaps more significant. They included razor business leader Chip Bergh, who left to take over Levi Strauss & Co LEVST.UL in 2011, and vice chairman Ed Shirley, who became CEO at Bacardi Ltd BACLTD.UL in 2012. When he announced McDonald had been named to the top job in 2009, McNerney described him as “the most broadly and globally experienced CEO in P&G; history” and said he got the position after “a rigorous, disciplined and multi-year succession process led by the Board.” The decision to bring back Lafley was applauded by investors who pushed P&G;’s share price up 4 percent on Friday, though they slipped back slightly on Tuesday to close at $80.86. The stock rose initially because Lafley was seen as a known quantity, investors said. However, some of the company’s current problems started to come to light towards the end of his time as CEO, some analysts said. Lafley left P&G; with a bloated organization after leading several acquisitions, most notably the $57 billion purchase of Gillette in 2005, and P&G; also was widely seen as slow in expanding in fast-growing emerging markets and introducing products to appeal to more frugal consumers in developed markets. Ashar said it was striking P&G; would turn back to Lafley, the architect of many past successes but also a force behind McDonald’s installation. “What it tells me is that the current ‘All Star’ board of P&G; really has delegated the responsibility of sense-making back to Lafley.” ",5292013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-proctergamble-ceo-board-analysis/analysis-pg-all-star-boards-oversight-questioned-as-ceo-departs-idUSBRE94S05U20130529
236,PG,P&G; to regroup products into four sectors - WSJ,"May 30 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co is working to regroup its countless products and brands into four sectors, each led by a president reporting to chief executive A.G. Lafley, who returned to the helm last week, the Wall Street Journal reported. The elevation of four executives to the new roles would publicly identify candidates most likely to succeed Lafley, who is expected to step aside in two or three years, the Journal reported citing people familiar with the matter. () Lafley stepped down as CEO in 2009 but returned last Thursday to replace Bob McDonald as chairman and chief executive of the world’s largest household products maker, which is undergoing a major restructuring to improve productivity and flexibility. P&G; currently organizes its products, ranging from Gillette razors to Duracell batteries, into two global business units — beauty and grooming and household care. The composition of the four new sectors was not immediately clear, the Journal said. The two vice chairmen, Werner Geissler and Dimitri Panayotopoulos, are not seen as likely to become CEO and are not in the running to head the new sectors, the business daily said. Candidates for the four spots include Melanie Healey, group president of North America; David Taylor, group president of global home care; Martin Riant, group president of global baby care; Giovanni Ciserani, group president of global fabric care; and Deborah Henretta, group president of global beauty care, the paper said. The four presidents would not be the only aspirants for the top job, the business daily reported.

238,PG,UPDATE 1-Procter & Gamble reorganizes businesses under four units,"June 5 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co, the world’s largest household products maker, on Wednesday announced a reorganization amid speculation by analysts that the heads of its new units are in the running to replace CEO A.G. Lafley. The maker of Tide laundry detergent and Gillette razors brought back Lafley as chief executive in May, as it came under pressure from investors to pick up the pace of improvements. In an expected move, the company will split its household care and beauty and grooming units into four sectors starting July 1: Global Baby, Feminine and Family Care; Global Beauty; Global Health and Grooming; and Global Fabric and Home Care. “We expect this structure to facilitate faster global expansion of brand and product innovations to win with customers,” Lafley said in a statement. “The individuals who are reporting directly to Lafley are obviously potential candidates to be named to the top spot,” said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash, adding that she expects Lafley to be a caretaker CEO. Martin Riant, Deborah Henretta, David Taylor and Giovanni Ciserani will lead the units as group presidents. They are assuming additional duties with the change, and will report directly to Lafley. The company also said that Charles Pierce will assume responsibilities for New Business Creation and Innovation from Jorge Mesquita, who is leaving the company. Pierce will report to Lafley in that additional role. Also on July 1, Dimitri Panayotopoulos, current vice chairman for Global Business Units, will assume the role of vice chairman and adviser to the chairman and CEO. He will continue to report to Lafley. Melanie Healey, group president of North America and Global Hyper, Super and Mass Channel, will begin reporting to Lafley in addition to Werner Geissler, vice chairman, Global Operations, who also reports to the CEO. “I think there will be more changes to come, too.

240,PG,P&G; appears back on track with CEO Lafley's return,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) forecast a slightly more upbeat 2014 than expected on Thursday as Chief Executive A.G. Lafley tries to get the world’s largest household products maker back on track without sacrificing profitability. P&G; reported lower quarterly earnings but they still topped the company’s muted expectations from April. The shares rose 1.4 percent to $81.47. P&G;, maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, brought back Lafley in late May to replace Bob McDonald, who had struggled to respond to thrifty consumer spending, sparked by the recession, create new product hits, and expand in fast-growing international markets. In the two months since he returned, Lafley has done a “deep dive” to figure out what needs fixing. He said the current fiscal 2014 would be a “transition” year, with fiscal 2013 a “stepping stone.” P&G; forecast 2014 core earnings per share rising 5 percent to 7 percent, including an expected hit of 6 percentage points from foreign exchange fluctuations. Before Thursday, expectations were high that P&G;’s outlook would be much weaker than the 6.7 percent growth that analysts anticipated. “This strikes me as better than the whisper numbers that I had been hearing,” David Kolpak, equity research analyst at Victory Capital Management. “I think that’s prudent, that’s what he ought to be doing at this point. You don’t want to overpromise out of the gate.” With Lafley back at the helm, P&G; sees more opportunities to cut costs, such as trimming marketing expenses as a percentage of sales, and wants to better understand what consumers want. He has already split P&G; into four businesses, hoping the new structure will boost efficiency. “We know we’re not winning like we know we can,” Lafley told analysts and investors on a conference call. “We simply have to execute better,” he added later. Lafley returned one month before the fiscal year ended, so recent gains in market share and sales came under McDonald. Under McDonald, P&G; cut production and marketing costs and came out with products such as Tide Pods, which has seen some early success. Under a $10 billion restructuring announced in February 2012, P&G; has cut 7,000 jobs through June, or 1,300 more than its target. P&G;’s quarterly net profit dropped nearly 50 percent but core earnings per share, which strip out various factors and are more closely watched by Wall Street, fell just 4 percent. “To me, this is the quarter that they really needed to have. It wasn’t a blowout quarter, but I don’t think anybody expected that,” said David Blount, co-portfolio manager at Eagle Asset Management, which owned more than 350,000 P&G; shares at June 30. P&G; said it would no longer give quarterly forecasts, instead providing an annual outlook with updates as the year progresses. It wants investors to focus on longer-term growth. P&G; expects organic sales, which strip out the impact of currency changes, acquisitions and divestitures, to rise 3 percent to 4 percent as the overall market grows at about 3.5 percent. Blount said the annual sales forecast looked conservative since P&G; usually talks about beating the market, not performing like the rest of the industry. Rivals include Europe’s Unilever (UNc.AS)(ULVR.L)(UN.N) and L’Oreal (OREP.PA) and U.S. companies such as Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N), Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N), Energizer Holdings Inc (ENR.N) and Clorox Co (CLX.N). While cost savings and improved productivity are necessary, “sales growth is the key here,” Blount said. P&G;’s core earnings per share fell to 79 cents from 82 cents a year earlier, beating its April forecast of 69 cents to 77 cents and analysts’ average estimate of 77 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 2.2 percent to $20.66 billion, topping analysts’ average target of $20.55 billion. Also Tuesday, Clorox said its quarterly profit increased to $1.37 per share, topping the analysts’ view of $1.34, while sales rose less than expected. The bleach maker stood by its fiscal 2014 forecast, but said the recent rise of the U.S. dollar and volatile commodity prices could weigh on results. Through Wednesday, P&G;’s stock had climbed 2 percent since Lafley’s May return. Clorox fell 0.6 percent to $85.45.

China’s official PMI for manufacturing rose to 50.3 in July, above expectations it would fall to 49.9 from 50.1 in June, suggesting a pick up in activity as growth in new orders increased. Adding to the optimism, Markit’s Eurozone Manufacturing PMI rose to 50.3 in July from June’s 48.8, revised slightly higher from a preliminary reading of 50.1 and topping the 50 threshold for growth for the first time since July 2011. But a rival HSBC report on China’s manufacturing was much more gloomy, falling to 47.7 in July, the weakest reading since August 2012, from 48.2 in June and tempered growth expectations. The data pointed to modest global growth and served to keep intact expectations global central banks will retain policies designed to stimulate their respective economies. “After a choppy and erratic session yesterday, failing to break above 1,700, the market is taking some positive China data along with leads from Europe to put on an impressive early morning session,” said Andre Bakhos, director of market analytics at Lek Securities in New York. In its latest policy statement on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve gave no hint that a reduction in the pace of its bond-buying program was imminent, as the economy continues to recover but is still in need of support. S&P; 500 futures rose 12 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures gained 114 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 20.75 points. Weekly initial jobless claims numbers are due at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT). Economists in a Reuters survey forecast a total of 345,000 new filings, compared with 343,000 in the prior week. At 8:58 a.m. (1258 GMT), Markit releases its U.S. final Markit Manufacturing PMI for July. The index read 53.2 in the flash July report. Later in the session, at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT), the Institute for Supply Management releases its July manufacturing index and the Commerce Department releases June construction spending data. The Bank of England made no changes at its second policy meeting Thursday under its new governor, Mark Carney, keeping interest rates at 0.5 percent and leaving its bond-buying program on ice. The European Central Bank also left interest rates at a record low 0.5 percent, with President Mario Draghi expected to emphasize rates will stay at record lows for an extended period at his news conference, which starts at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT). The benchmark S&P; index has traded within 10 points of the 1,700 level for 10 straight sessions, representing a technical resistance level which could lead to more gains if significantly pierced. Procter & Gamble Co rose 1.4 percent to $81.40 in premarket after the world’s largest household products maker posted a quarterly profit that fell less than expected and said full-year’s earnings should rise at least as much as last year.

245,PG,Chic and cheap: China takes shine to South Korean cosmetics,"* South Korean cosmetics firms see strong sales in China * Korean firms take on brands owned by L’Oreal, P&G; * Korea brands seen more suitable for Asians; prices affordable * China’s personal care and cosmetics market worth $34 bln this year By Hyunjoo Jin SEOUL, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Cosmetics brand Laneige has a French name and luxurious blue-and-white packaging but its legions of fans in China, the world’s third-largest beauty products market, love it because it is South Korean and affordable. Laneige, or “the snow”, is one of about two dozen brands made by South Korea’s biggest cosmetics company Amorepacific Corp which is using its Asian cachet and pocket-friendly prices to give global firms like L’Oreal SA , and Procter & Gamble Co a run for their money. Other South Korea cosmetics manufacturers like LG Household & Healthcare and Able C&C; are also using similar strategies to expand in China’s beauty and personal care market, which is estimated to be worth $34 billion this year. “We’re taking aim at P&G;’s Olay and L’Oreal Paris in China’s mass market segment with our entry-level brands,” said Lee Chang-kyoo, head of Amorepacific’s corporate strategy team. “Our company is able to quickly read market trends and roll out products when something is in vogue,” Lee told Reuters. “Recently Chinese local brands are also really doing well, so they are also our competitors.” Paris-based L’Oreal and Cincinnati, Ohio-based P&G; declined to comment. Korean beauty brands have little global renown, but in Asia they are household names because of perfectly groomed celebrity ambassadors such as actress Song Hye-kyo, singer Yoona of Girls’ Generation and male entertainer Kim Hyun-joong. Korea’s vibrant entertainment industry has wide appeal in the region, and its stars are often held up as an ideal of beauty by both men and women. On its website, Amorepacific says it wants to be thought of as the “Asian beauty creator” and its sales figures suggest it is winning over more Chinese customers. Amorepacific saw the fastest sales growth in skin care products among the top 10 cosmetics companies in China last year, data from consumer research firm Euromonitor shows. The Korean firm’s China sales jumped 34 percent year-on-year, outperforming market leader L’Oreal’s 13 percent increase, second-ranked Shiseido Co Ltd’s 12 percent rise and third-ranked P&G;’s 5 percent growth. Amorepacific also increased its share in China’s skincare market by 0.5 percentage points to 2.6 percent last year, according to Euromonitor. That compares with a 0.5 percentage point growth in L’Oreal’s market share to 16.8 percent during the same period, and a 0.4 percentage point fall for P&G; to 9.8 percent. Zhang Pinghua, a 52-year-old Shanghai woman who usually buys products from Estee Lauder Companies Inc, started using Laneige face masks on a friend’s recommendation. “It fits Asian skin more,” said Zhang. Her 22-year-old daughter, Shen Ruyi, is a fan of The Face Shop, a low-cost brand of LG Household and Healthcare, a unit of the LG conglomerate. “My school mates use it because it is cheaper than some Japanese brands,” she added. Japan is currently Asia’s biggest cosmetics market but second-ranked China is growing at a much faster pace - Euromonitor forecasts 63 percent growth in China for the five years ending 2015 compared with flat growth for Japan. Amorepacific posted on Tuesday a 35 percent increase in its second quarter China sales. LG Household and Healthcare’s The Face Shop brand also posted a 52 percent jump in sales in China and Japan in the same quarter. Most of the Korean cosmetics firms are targetting the mid-to-low end of the China market by rapidly opening stores and bombarding customers with hundreds of new products each year. The Korean firms are able to offer so many products so quickly because they outsource production to companies such as Cosmax Inc, which also supplies L’Oreal, said Tiger Kim, head of Seoul-based consultancy CosmeticConsulting. For example, Amorepacific’s budget Innisfree brand launched 100 make-up and 70 skin care products in China in the first half of this year alone. The demand for cheaper cosmetics is rapidly growing in South Korea too, where global brands have been eclipsed by their domestic rivals in recent years. Able C&C;, owner of the budget Missha brand, relies on another strategy: it makes products that are similar to luxury cosmetics but which sell for a fraction of the price, such as a skin smoothing lotion that it markets as a cheaper alternative to the flagship product of P&G;’s high-end SK-II brand. The company says it has 1,120 stores in 25 countries including China, Japan and the United States and plans to venture into Europe and South America next year. “Most Korean beauty products emphasise natural ingredients and they are made for Asian skin. They are endorsed by various Korean celebrities as well,” said Lui Meng Chow, a research analyst at Mintel, a global consumer research company. “Their mid-range Korean beauty care products’ entry into China will certainly impact the multinational brands.”",8072013,http://www.reuters.com/article/korea-cosmetics/chic-and-cheap-china-takes-shine-to-south-korean-cosmetics-idUSL4N0G20LX20130807
246,PG,Departed P&G; CEO made five percent more last year as bonus rose,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) said on Friday it paid Bob McDonald, the former chairman, president and chief executive who abruptly left last spring, nearly 5 percent more last year as the company’s performance improved. McDonald was replaced in P&G;’s top spot on May 23 by his predecessor, A.G. Lafley. While McDonald’s departure was termed a retirement, many saw the change as confirmation that his tenure was a disappointment and that the world’s largest household products maker needed Lafley to reassure investors and employees. McDonald earned a $3.3 million bonus in fiscal 2013, up from $2.4 million a year earlier, when P&G; started a major restructuring. Lafley earned almost $2 million as he took the helm for the last few weeks of the fiscal year, including salary, bonus and cash instead of stock and option awards, according to the P&G; proxy filing.

The company met or exceeded targets that are factored into executives’ compensation. Fiscal 2013 core earnings per share rose 5 percent, exceeding the company’s forecast of a decline of 1 percent to an increase of 4 percent. Free cash flow productivity also exceeded its goal, and organic sales rose 3 percent, the midpoint of P&G;’s forecast of 2 percent to 4 percent. Organic sales exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange. In fiscal 2012, P&G; issued profit warnings and McDonald admitted the company was too slow to react to thriftier shopping habits, create product hits, and expand in fast-growing international markets. McDonald’s salary was flat at $1.6 million and his longer-term compensation was relatively unchanged. Overall, he took home more than $15.9 million, up from nearly $15.2 million the year before. From May 23 to June 30, Lafley earned $1.94 million.

249,PG,"Expert networks: thriving in Asia, away from U.S. scrutiny","SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Expert networks - a matchmaking service linking investors such as hedge funds with company insiders - are under scrutiny from regulators in the United States, but are expanding across Asia, where the market for corporate intelligence is less transparent. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has charged over three dozen people and firms as part of a broad investigation into ties between investors and expert networks that has uncovered insider trading and helped trigger the high-profile fall of Raj Rajaratnam’s Galleon hedge fund. Those cases have bruised confidence in expert networks in the United States, and some clients have stopped using the service for fear of falling foul of regulators. But in Asia, where regulators have yet to pay the industry much attention, the service is thriving - fertile ground where emerging market investors are willing to pay for inside knowledge on company supply chains, key personnel moves or regulatory shifts. “The fastest sales process has been in Asia,” said David Legg, managing director of Asia and Europe for Gerson Lehrman Group (GLG), the biggest player in the industry. GLG says it has tripled its Asia revenue in the past three years. Several local firms have also entered the market. Legg says a relative lack of transparency in Asian markets means investors are much less willing to rely solely on research from investment banks and brokerages. “In London and New York, you get a lot of people who say: ‘Look, I can rely on some banking analyst on the sell-side to help me figure out something’; In Asia, nobody believes that”. The growth of expert networks across Asia equips the region’s struggling hedge fund industry with a key information service, while presenting regulators and companies with a new challenge - how to police this paid-for exchange of information. According to people interviewed by Reuters, few companies in Asia are aware that their employees may be speaking to investors through a middle-man, and being paid for it. Capvision, the biggest expert network group in China, said it has tripled in size over the past 3-4 years and now employs close to 200 people. It says it can connect clients with more than 60,000 “knowledge consultants” across all major industries. “We have been fortunate enough to be in one of the fastest growing markets in the world and were able to capitalize on the fact that information flow in China has always been fairly un-transparent,” said Kai Hong, a former Bain & Co consultant who co-founded the business in 2006. Expert networks are similar to dating agencies that match couples based on their compatibility criteria. They build a database of company executives, policy experts and academics, whose services are offered to investors interested in tapping this expertise. They make money by taking a slice of the fee the clients pay for talking to the expert. Expert networks and hedge funds that Reuters spoke to said experts are paid anywhere from $300 to more than $3,000 an hour, depending on their area of expertise. The networks don’t say how much revenue they are generating. GLG said it has around 400 institutional investor clients across Asia, as well as clients at strategy consultancies, hedge funds, banks, companies and private equity firms. The primary research industry, which is mainly expert networks but also includes some market research firms, was worth $466 million last year, according to Integrity Research, which monitors the independent research industry. The networks don’t offer any regional revenue breakdown, though GLG’s Legg said investors tend to spend more on their services per dollar invested in the region compared to the United States. Vick Aggarwala is an ‘expert’. He is president of Supreme Components International, a Singapore-based distributor of high-end electronics to Samsung Electronics, Sony Corp and other big technology companies, and he speaks several times a month to investors and bank analysts he was introduced to through GLG. “We know what the trends are, we know what manufacturers are doing in terms of pricing, the inventory channel, whether their lead times are stretching out or coming down,” he said, adding people in his position know which emerging markets are doing well, and what is anticipated in the coming quarters. That’s the kind of intelligence investors hope will give them a steer as to which companies will sell more smartphones or TVs in the next few months. That helps them position themselves in the market, betting on which way share prices may go. Aggarwala says he follows strict protocol when talking to investors so as not to let slip any confidential information. Expert networks say their rules of engagement mean they help prevent, rather than encourage, insider trading. “The last place you’d want to be if you want to get into insider trading is on an expert network platform where it’s obvious to the regulator or anybody else who wants to inquire exactly who you spoke with, when, and what the topic was,” said GLG’s Legg. Others, however, question why investors would spend so much money for an hour of a senior executive’s time if the information doesn’t give them an inside edge. Paul Sheehan, former CEO of hedge fund Thaddeus Capital in Hong Kong, said he blocked all networks when they tried contacting his firm. “I did not want to be associated with them because it was very clear to me that what they were offering was a major compliance risk,” he said. Another hedge fund manager in Hong Kong, who didn’t want to be named, said he had regularly used the networks, but does so less nowadays. “What you think is your special adviser is not yours,” the fund manager said. “He’s someone many people are calling and he’s generally answering the same questions.” Philippa Allen, CEO of ComplianceAsia, a regulation consulting firm, said that since the insider dealing scandals in the United States, expert networks themselves and their large institutional clients had become more selective in the experts they sought, with many investors avoiding those working at public listed companies, due to the heightened regulatory risks. “They are trying to sort of put some distance between very current information and the information they receive. That’s become a lot more common. It’s actually being driven by the expert networks themselves,” she said. Insight Alpha, a network focused on India and Southeast Asia, says on its website how it can put investors in touch with CEOs, army generals, cabinet ministers, bureaucrats and market regulators, among others. It says it has firm rules on avoiding conflicts of interest. Regulators in Asia have yet to get to grips in dealing with any such conflicts. “It’s just not an area that Asian governments have really wanted to prosecute and look into. A lot of countries don’t even have data privacy rules in place yet,” said ComplianceAsia’s Allen. Sanford Bragg, CEO of Integrity Research, said some local law enforcement agencies are now paying more attention. “I’ve heard of a small China-based expert network, which is no longer around, setting up consultations with government officials,” he said, adding the network ran into trouble when it was found the officials received perks in exchange for information. For the networks’ experts, the growth in these platforms can mean a significant income supplement. An academic at a China business school, who also has links to the financial services industry, said he was paid more than $100,000 last year for work he got through GLG. “In the old days, a lot of expert networks involved company insiders leaking information ahead of earnings releases,” said the academic, declining to be named. “That’s illegal, and it seems to me it would be very difficult to do today.” For some investors, though, the risks of using the networks outweigh the potential rewards. “Do they (networks) listen to the actual calls between the experts and manager? Do they report it for compliance purposes? This would be a technologically simple thing to do,” said Sheehan, the former Thaddeus Capital CEO. “So, ask yourself: Why don’t they do it? They don’t want to find out what’s really going on.” (This story is refiled to correct spelling of name in second paragraph) ",9032013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-investors-networks-asia/expert-networks-thriving-in-asia-away-from-u-s-scrutiny-idUSBRE9810N320130903
250,PG,"Expert networks: thriving in Asia, away from U.S. scrutiny","(Adds additional comments from GLG, context) By Rachel Armstrong and Nishant Kumar SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Expert networks - a matchmaking service that connects investors with industry experts - are under scrutiny from regulators in the United States, but are expanding across Asia where the market for corporate intelligence is less transparent. The industry’s reputation took a hit in the United States, after the Securities and Exchange Commission charged more than three dozen people and firms as part of a broad investigation into ties between investors and expert networks. The cases uncovered examples of insider trading and helped trigger the high-profile fall of Raj Rajaratnam’s Galleon hedge fund. Those cases bruised confidence in the industry and caused some U.S. clients to stop using the service for fear of falling foul of regulators. But in Asia, demand for corporate intelligence is surging and the industry is growing strongly. No high-profile hedge fund case has stigmatized the industry as it has in the United States and expert networks themselves say the region, with its weaker disclosure requirements, is well suited to their services. Indeed, hedge fund investors say Asian regulators have yet to pay the industry much attention in a part of the world where emerging market investors are paying top dollar for knowledge of company supply chains, key personnel moves or regulatory shifts. “The fastest sales process has been in Asia,” said David Legg, managing director of Asia and Europe for Gerson Lehrman Group (GLG), the biggest player in the industry. GLG says it has tripled its Asia revenue in the past three years, while several local firms have also entered the market.

Some expert networks, as the U.S. cases revealed, employ people who are currently on staff at a company that customers are interested in learning more about. According to people interviewed by Reuters, few companies in Asia are aware that their employees may be speaking to investors through a middle-man, and being paid for it.

253,PG,Procter & Gamble sticks by forecasts; profit meets expectations,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) is chugging along with its turnaround, posting a quarterly profit that met Wall Street’s expectations and holding to its annual forecasts as the world’s largest household products maker gets a lift from cost cuts and a lower tax rate. Shares of P&G; fell nearly 1 percent to $79.93 in morning trading on Friday. The maker of Pampers diapers and Tide detergent is trying to reinvigorate itself under Chief Executive Officer A.G. Lafley, who returned in late May to replace Bob McDonald. Lafley, who did not speak on the company’s conference call on Friday, has previously said the current fiscal 2014 would be a “transition” year, after the “stepping stone” year that ended in June. He has already split P&G; into four businesses, hoping the new structure will boost efficiency. “We continue to think the appointment of Lafley is more temporary in nature, until a permanent successor can be named,” said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. She said she was “a bit perplexed” by P&G;’s decision to have Lafley participate only on certain calls and at major industry conferences as the company works to “instill confidence and reignite its momentum.” P&G; said it still expected 5 percent to 7 percent growth in earnings per share this fiscal year, excluding restructuring charges. The company abandoned quarterly forecasts earlier this year. It still expects organic sales, which strip out the impact of currency changes, acquisitions and divestitures, to rise 3 percent to 4 percent this fiscal year. Regarding Lafley’s absence from the call, a P&G; spokesman Paul Fox said: “This change reflects our focus on annual results and trends rather than quarterly results and is consistent with our recent move to fiscal guidance.” P&G; held or increased market share in businesses that represent about two-thirds of its sales during the quarter, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said. While he said he was “reasonably happy” with the results, he added: “We simply have to execute better, more consistently and more reliably.” P&G; competes against a variety of companies, including Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS). On Thursday, Unilever’s results suggested that its North American market share in the high-margin personal care business suffered because of promotions that P&G; ran on its hair care products such as Pantene shampoo. However, Moeller refuted such assertions, saying that P&G;’s hair care product promotions were down from a year earlier. The company’s market share in the category was flat. Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) also discussed a more promotional U.S. market when it released its results on Thursday. “We see a different reality,” Moeller told reporters. “Promotion is important, and we will be competitive in our promotional activities, but it is not an area where we seek to lead.” In North America overall, P&G;’s share of the volume of goods that were sold on promotions was down 7 percent from a year earlier, Moeller said. P&G; said it had earned $3.03 billion, or $1.04 per share, in the first quarter ended on September 30, up from $2.81 billion, or 96 cents per share, a year earlier. Core earnings per share, which exclude restructuring charges, fell 1 percent to $1.05 and met analysts’ expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 2.2 percent to $21.21 billion, topping Wall Street’s forecast of $21.04 billion. Organic sales rose 4 percent. Such sales were up in every category except healthcare, where they were flat, due in part to a pet food recall. The beauty business was a disappointment, with organic sales growth of just 1 percent, analysts said. P&G; blamed the sluggish growth on factors such as a decrease in skin care product sales. JPMorgan analyst John Faucher said he had expected 3 percent organic sales growth in the beauty division.

PGT Healthcare will partner with Swisse Wellness to begin expanding its range of more than 100 vitamins, minerals and supplements globally over the next few years, the companies said on Tuesday. The licensing deal will integrate the companies’ strengths to enable the rapid expansion of the Swisse brand of VMS products to new countries. The collaboration will benefit from PGT Healthcare’s consumer understanding, marketing scale, and global regulatory expertise with Swisse Wellness’s VMS product development expertise, portfolio of more than 100 products, and unique marketing model.

262,PG,Sponsor P&G; sets more modest target for Winter Games,"LONDON (Reuters) - With the Winter Olympics only a month away, Procter & Gamble - one of the event’s leading sponsors - launched its main advertising campaign on Monday, seeking a more modest return than from the summer games in London 18 months ago. The household goods company, best known for brands such as Duracell batteries and Gillette razors, estimated London 2012 gave it a $500 million sales boost, but is targeting around a third of that figure from the Games in the Russian town of Sochi, as fewer nations take part in the Winter Olympics. “The Winter Games aren’t typically as big as the summer Games,” said Marc Pritchard, global brand-building officer for U.S.-based P&G;, which joined the group of 10 leading Olympic sponsors in 2010. The focus of the P&G; campaign, featuring clips of sports such as skating and skiing to be shown in TV commercials and online, will be on countries where winter sports have large followings, including Russia itself, China, the United States, Canada, Germany and Poland. P&G;, the world’s biggest corporate spender on advertising, waited until after Christmas before stepping up its Olympic marketing ahead of the February 7-23 Games. “For winter we found that it’s best to start right after the holidays and then leading up to the Games,” Pritchard said. The company is again using the “Thank You Mom” message that featured in its London Olympic commercials, underlining the role mothers play in bringing up successful athletes. The Games have focused attention on Russia’s human rights record and in particular its attitude towards homosexuality. Some U.S. activists have urged sponsors to boycott Sochi over a law that forbids the dissemination of information on homosexuality to minors, citing it as an example of intolerance towards minorities. Pritchard believes the International Olympic Committee (IOC) will ensure the Olympics are not marred by prejudice. “What we would expect out of the Games is that athletes should be able to compete regardless of their national origin, gender or sexual orientation,” he said. “We’re fully confident that the IOC will ensure that these Games come ... free of discrimination.” The top sponsors, who also include Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and Visa, pay around $100 million each over a four-year period covering a summer and winter Games for the right to use the five-rings Olympic logo and brand in their global marketing.

With many market participants expecting the Fed next week to shave its stimulus by another $10 billion a month, investors will look to less risky assets such as U.S. bonds, expecting interest rates will begin to rise. The Fed’s policymakers will conclude a two-day meeting on Wednesday. A rout in emerging market assets spread to developed countries in Europe on worries over Fed policy, slowing growth in China and political problems in Turkey, Argentina and Ukraine. Worries over China’s growth emerged after a disappointing manufacturing number spurred the S&P; 500 to a 0.9 percent fall on Thursday. The Turkish lira hit a fresh record low and the South African rand a new five-year low against the dollar. U.S.-listed shares of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A.  slumped 5.3 percent to $12.01. Shares of the Spanish bank with heavy exposure to Latin America fell a day after Argentina’s peso suffered its steepest daily decline in 12 years, prompting Argentina’s government to loosen strict foreign exchange controls. “It’s just the final realization that they can’t continue to grow as an economy the same way they did before,” said Andres Garcia-Amaya, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds, in New York. “It’s a combination of less liquidity for these countries that depended on foreign money, and China kind of throwing some curveballs as well.” Benchmark 10-year Treasuries notes were up 11/32 in price with a yield of 2.735 percent. Argentina’s government said Friday it would loosen strict foreign exchange controls, after it abandoned its long-standing policy of intervening to support the peso currency. That resulted in the currency’s steepest plunge since the 2002 financial crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 124.39 points or 0.77 percent, to 16,072.96, the S&P; 500 lost 15.26 points or 0.83 percent, to 1,813.2 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 38.212 points or 0.91 percent, to 4,180.663.

Its shares edged up 0.5 percent to $90.24. Thomson Reuters data through Thursday morning shows earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to grow 7 percent.

A rout in emerging market assets spread to developed countries in Europe on worries about Fed policy, slowing growth in China and political problems in Turkey, Argentina and Ukraine.

The benchmark index fell below its 50-day moving average for the first time since Dec. 18, a technical support level that could indicate more selling pressure if convincingly pierced. “The big question, the one that everybody is trying to get their brain around is: ‘Is this the correction that is the buying opportunity or are we setting up for something a little bit different?’” said Gordon Charlop, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities in New York. “You had to figure, at some point, the multiples were expanding to a spot where we were going to not see the same kind of growth we saw last year in terms of equity returns.” Among the 10 major S&P; 500 sectors, the industrials index  fared the worst, down 2.3 percent as General Electric Co lost 2.7 percent to $25.13 and Boeing Co fell 2.9 percent to $137.23.

The Nasdaq Composite  dropped 61.745 points or 1.46 percent, to 4,157.13.

The last time the spread between the CBOE volatility index and three-month VIX futures turned negative was in mid- October, shortly after a 4.8 percent pullback in the S&P; 500 opened the door to the last leg of the 2013 market rally.

P&G;, the maker of Pampers diapers and Tide detergent, said revenue rose 8 percent in developing countries in its fiscal second quarter, but barely edged up in mature markets like the United States and Europe. It stuck to its 2014 sales and profit forecasts. Kimberly-Clark reported similar gains in emerging markets, helped by strong growth in China, and gave an upbeat 2014 forecast. Earlier this weak, rival Unilever (ULVR.L)(UNc.AS) said it would stick to its developing markets growth strategy as it reported 2013 results were boosted by a fourth-quarter recovery in sales in the segment. P&G; shares were up 2.8 percent to $80.41 in early-afternoon trading, while Kimberly-Clark was up 2.7 percent to $108.25. The broader market was sharply lower. .N “The emerging markets have become increasingly volatile,” said Ali Dibadj, an analyst with Sanford C.

Kimberly-Clark Chief Executive Tom Falk said he expected “significant” pressure from foreign exchange and higher commodity costs in 2014. The Argentina peso’s official rate has fallen 20 percent against the U.S. dollar so far this month, pressuring inflation even higher as confidence falls in Latin America’s No. 3 economy. Under pressure to fix myriad economic ills, Venezuela’s socialist government announced on Wednesday that hotly sought U.S. dollars would now be traded at two different rates. The growth in emerging markets was one reason P&G; reported a decline of 0.9 percentage point in its profit margins. The company is building its presence in the developing segment. The costs are worth paying, said one longtime investor. “The emerging markets are definitely the future for P&G;,” said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel, which manages about $11 billion and holds both P&G; and Kimberly-Clark shares. P&G;’s gross margin was also hurt by stagnant sales in beauty products, including a drop in skin-care sales.

Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told reporters on a conference call that sales in emerging markets had risen 8 percent during the second quarter, easily outpacing developed markets, where sales barely edged up. But P&G;’s gross margin is lower in those markets as the company establishes itself. Still, the costs are worth paying, said one investor. “The emerging markets are definitely the future for P&G;,” said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel, which manages about $11 billion and has long owned P&G; and Kimberly-Clark Corp shares. P&G;’s Moeller said its market shares in both emerging and developed sectors had held steady. Earlier this weak, rival Unilever said it would stick to its emerging markets growth strategy as a fourth-quarter recovery in sales there boosted 2013 results. P&G;’s gross profit margin slipped 0.9 percentage points, in part because of stagnant sales of its beauty products, which have higher margins. The margins were helped by lower manufacturing costs.

271,PG,"UPDATE 2-Emerging markets lift P&G; Q2 sales, crimp gross margin","By Phil Wahba Jan 24 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co, the world’s largest household products maker, reported a dip in quarterly profit on Friday as its push in emerging markets led to a lower gross profit margin. Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told reporters on a conference call that sales in emerging markets had risen 8 percent during the second quarter, easily outpacing developed markets, where sales barely edged up. But P&G;’s gross margin is lower in those markets as the company establishes itself. Still, the costs are worth paying, said one investor. “The emerging markets are definitely the future for P&G;,” said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel, which manages about $11 billion and has long owned P&G; and Kimberly-Clark Corp shares. P&G;’s Moeller said its market shares in both emerging and developed sectors had held steady. Earlier this weak, rival Unilever  said it would stick to its emerging markets growth strategy as a fourth-quarter recovery in sales there boosted 2013 results. P&G;’s gross profit margin slipped 0.9 percentage points, in part because of stagnant sales of its beauty products, which have higher margins. The margins were helped by lower manufacturing costs. P&G;, the maker of Pampers diapers and Tide detergent, left its 2014 forecasts unchanged. It still expects organic sales, which strip out the impact of currency changes as well as acquisitions and divestitures, to rise 3 percent to 4 percent, and core earnings to rise 5 percent to 7 percent. “It is reassuring to see it has confidence it can hit the numbers, despite the weak categories,” J.P. Morgan analyst John Faucher wrote in a note. The company’s beauty division continued to struggle during the quarter, with organic sales unchanged as skin care results slipped. P&G;’s health care segment reported the fastest growth, rising 5 percent. The company earned $3.43 billion, or $1.18 per share, in its fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31, down from $4.06 billion, or $1.39 per share, a year earlier. Core earnings per share, excluding restructuring charges, fell 1 percent to $1.21. Analysts expected $1.20 a share.

274,PG,Merck gets buyout interest for consumer health unit -sources,"NEW YORK, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc has received approaches from large consumer companies interested in buying its consumer healthcare business, best known for Coppertone sunscreen and Claritin allergy medicine, according to people familiar with the matter. Merck’s consumer healthcare business, which also includes Dr. Scholl’s foot care and other consumer products, could be worth as much as $8 billion to $10 billion in a sale, or roughly four to five times the unit’s annual revenue, some of the people said. Merck, the No. 2 U.S. drugmaker after Pfizer Inc, is considering alternatives for both its consumer and animal health businesses and has said it expects to complete the review in 2014. Among a range of options it has considered for the consumer unit, Merck discussed a potential asset swap with Novartis AG , under which Merck would give up its consumer assets in return for the Swiss drugmaker’s animal health and other units, Reuters and others previously reported. The probability of carrying out such a deal, however, is currently seen as low due to the complexity of valuing different businesses, prompting Merck to explore an outright sale of its consumer unit as well, people familiar with the matter said. Merck has been in conversations with several interested parties and is being advised by Morgan Stanley on the process, the people said, asking not to be named because the conversations are private. For its much larger animal health unit, the second-largest in the industry after Zoetis Inc, Merck is evaluating the potential of spinning it off as a separate publicly traded company, people familiar with the matter said. Analysts and people familiar with the industry say big consumer companies such as Reckitt Benckiser Group and Procter & Gamble Co could be logical buyers for Merck’s consumer healthcare business. Reckitt already owns over-the-counter medicines including Mucinex and Nurofen and the international rights for the Scholl foot care business. Its chief executive told Reuters in a September interview that Reckitt aimed to be a major player in consumer healthcare and has the firepower to do sizeable deals. Procter & Gamble Co also has a portfolio that includes a range of medicines and beauty products. Reckitt and P&G; declined to comment. Johnson & Johnson is the biggest player in the $200 billion global consumer health industry, with about 4 percent of the market, followed by Bayer AG and GlaxoSmithKline Plc. Merck, however, is relatively small with around 1 percent of the market. Merck has said in the past that it views its consumer business as sub-scale. In considering options for the consumer and animal health businesses, Merck is following in the footsteps of other drugmakers such as Pfizer Inc, which created shareholder value by seperating non-core assets. Pfizer sold its infant-nutrition business to Nestle SA  for $11.9 billion in 2012, and last year spun off its animal health unit as a separate publicly traded company called Zoetis. Many other drugmakers have been looking to shed businesses, prompted by pricing pressure and increasing competition that has forced a more rigorous approach to capital allocation. They have shown a new willingness to consider whether other companies may be better owners for certain assets. A Merck spokeswoman declined to comment on details of the strategic review. Morgan Stanley did not respond to requests for comment.",1312014,http://www.reuters.com/article/merck-unit/merck-gets-buyout-interest-for-consumer-health-unit-sources-idUSL2N0L50N520140131
275,PG,Procter & Gamble cuts outlook on emerging market currency impact,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), the world’s largest household products maker, cut its sales and earnings outlook for the year on Tuesday to reflect unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Venezuela and the devaluation of currencies in various developing markets. The changed outlook reflects the recent devaluation against the dollar of the Argentine peso, Turkish lira, South African rand, Russian ruble, Ukrainian hryvnia, Brazilian real and several other currencies, said P&G;, whose products include Pampers diapers and Tide detergent. For U.S. companies that do substantial business in developing countries, the devaluations cause their earnings in those currencies to be worth less when converted back to dollars. Procter & Gamble said it now sees growth in core earnings per share of 3 percent to 5 percent, down from its prior outlook for growth of 5 to 7 percent. It also revised its forecast for sales growth to a range of flat to a rise of 2 percent versus its prior forecast for growth in a range of 1 to 2 percent. Procter & Gamble shares dipped 0.5 percent to $78.45 in after-market trading on Tuesday, after closing up 1.4 percent at $78.84 in regular trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The U.S. dollar is expected to make steady gains against major currencies this year as a recovery in the world’s largest economy gains steam and gives the Federal Reserve room to wind down its stimulus program. Plunging emerging market currencies have forced many global companies to hedge foreign currency exposure more aggressively and raise prices frequently. Automaker Ford Motor Co. (F.N), appliance maker Whirlpool Corp (WHR.N) and liquor giant Diageo (DGE.L) all cited weakness and a more sober outlook in once-roaring emerging markets in earnings reports last month.

276,PG,GLOBAL MARKETS-Global stock markets gain on China trade data; sterling up,"* China January export and import data ease growth worries * Dow, S&P; 500 slip after 4 days of gains as P&G; falls * U.S. bond prices down a day after Washington debt deal * Sterling rises as BoE hints at rate hike in 2015 By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Feb 12 (Reuters) - World stock markets edged up for a sixth straight session on Wednesday after upbeat trade data from China soothed worries about slower global growth, while the British pound rose to a two-week high against the dollar. The Dow and S&P; 500 closed down slightly, however, snapping four days of gains after Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest maker of consumer products, cut its outlook for profit and sales growth. The Chinese trade data showed solid demand, with exports rising in January, easing fears that the world’s second-largest economy is mired in a worsening slowdown and reviving investors’ appetite for emerging market assets that had been battered in recent weeks. The broad MSCI All-Country World Index was up 0.3 percent on the day, while the FTSEurofirst 300 index  ended up 0.7 percent. Europe is one of China’s largest trading partners. MSCI’s index of emerging market stocks added 0.9 percent , extending a bounce from five-month lows hit earlier this month. “Emerging markets look like they’re beginning to find their footing. I believe we’re back to viewing the global economy being in a glass-half-full expansion,” said Eric Teal, chief investment officer at First Citizens Bancshares Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina, which manages $3.5 billion. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 30.83 points, or 0.19 percent, to 15,963.94; the S&P; 500  lost 0.49 points, or 0.03 percent, to 1,819.26; and the Nasdaq Composite added 10.243 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,201.288. Procter & Gamble shares lost 1.7 percent to $77.49 and weighed on both the Dow and S&P; 500 after the company cut its sales and earnings growth outlooks for the year to reflect unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Venezuela and the devaluation of currencies in various developing markets. The lackluster move in U.S. stocks followed a rally on Tuesday after the U.S. House of Representatives voted to suspend the debt limit until March 2015 and the Federal Reserve’s new chief, Janet Yellen, held off from making any changes to the central bank’s schedule for trimming stimulus. The debt ceiling deal pressured U.S. bond prices for a second day, though. Benchmark 10-year Treasuries  were down 13/32 in price to yield 2.76 percent. Ten-year yields earlier hit 2.77 percent, their highest level since Jan. 29. “Overall, there’s less uncertainty,” said David Coard, head of fixed-income sales and trading at Williams Capital Group in New York. “I know that the debt ceiling resolution had a negative effect on the bills, but it had a positive effect on the longer end. So it all came together to see the sell-off that we’re seeing.” The Bank of England indicated that interest rates may need to rise in just over a year and lifted its growth forecast, sending the pound up against the dollar and the euro  . “The BoE seems to become the first major central bank, bar the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, to hike interest rates,” said Chris Turner, chief currency strategist at ING. “We are expecting a rate hike in February 2015, so in the short term sterling looks good, especially against the euro.” Sterling jumped to a two-week high of $1.6587, up 0.8 percent on the day. In commodities markets, gold prices ended little changed on profit-taking after rising to a three-month high near $1,300. Spot gold was up 0.2 percent to $1,293.55, after hitting a three-month high at $1,295.91. U.S. oil futures traded above $100 per barrel for the entire session for the first time since Oct. 18, and settled at the highest point since then, after data showed TransCanada Corp’s  Gulf Coast pipeline began in earnest to drain oil from benchmark delivery point Cushing, Oklahoma. Brent crude gained 11 cents to settle at $108.79, while U.S. crude oil rose 43 cents to settle at $100.37.",2122014,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-global/global-markets-global-stock-markets-gain-on-china-trade-data-sterling-up-idUSL2N0LH2CA20140212

The Nasdaq rose for a fifth straight session, boosted by strong results at TripAdvisor, while the Dow felt the pressure from P&G; and ended the day slightly lower. The S&P; 500 gained 3.9 percent over the past four sessions, its best four-day performance in 13 months. The move put it about 1.6 percent below its record closing high of 1,848.38 set on Jan. 15. “There isn’t a big discount to the market since valuations remain at or approaching fair value, but we don’t see it as overly expensive since earnings are growing steadily,” said Eric Teal, chief investment officer of First Citizens Bancshares in Raleigh, North Carolina. “We’re seeing a better tone in the market after a rough start to the month.” The recent advance came after Wall Street’s sharpest drop in more than a year, with a selloff triggered by turmoil in emerging markets. Those issues still play into markets, with Procter & Gamble saying its lower full-year earnings and sales outlook was related to the devaluation of currencies in various developing markets. Shares of P&G; lost 1.7 percent to close at $77.49. “Stocks that are closely tied to consumer spending patterns will see some volatility ahead,” said Teal, who helps oversee $3.5 billion in assets. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 30.83 points, or 0.19 percent, to end at 15,963.94. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost just 0.49 of a point, or 0.03 percent, to finish at 1,819.26.

Whole Foods Market Inc shares lost 6.4 percent to $51.90 after the largest U.S. natural and organic grocery chain cut its full-year sales and profit view. NetApp Inc  shares fell 3.7 percent in extended-hours trading following the company’s release of quarterly results after the market closed.

286,PG,No appetite for big consumer goods? Try their suppliers,"LONDON (Reuters) - As a slowdown in emerging markets takes the shine off shares in consumer goods makers like Nestle NESN.VX, Unilever (ULVR.L), Danone (DANO.PA) and Procter & Gamble (PG.N), hungry investors have been sampling more of the companies that supply them. Scent and flavor makers such as Symrise (SY1G.DE), Givaudan GIVN.VX and International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF.N), and food ingredient names like Glanbia (GL9.I) and Kerry Group (KYGa.I) are attractive, analysts say, because they’re more resistant to weak consumer spending and benefit from health and wellness trends forcing so many brands to modify their products. “The companies in those segments have exposure to faster growing specialty areas, serve a wide range of customers (from top brands to white label) and constantly invest in new technology,” Berenberg analysts said this month. They upgraded Germany’s Symrise to “buy” and Switzerland’s Givaudan to “hold”. JPMorgan Cazenove estimates the European food ingredients sector on average will see 6 percent earnings growth in 2014, while European food producers will see no growth. Indeed, consumer staples stocks have been battered by currency devaluations and cooling demand in emerging markets and lingering economic malaise in Europe and the United States. Over the past 12 months, the top 25 global consumer staples stocks are still up 7.5 percent on average, but down 3.5 percent in the year to date, according to Reuters data. By contrast, 2014 has favored ingredients. At Thursday’s close Kerry was up 3 percent, IFF 5 percent, Symrise 6 percent and Givaudan 9 percent. Still, there are outliers. Lower European sugar prices are squeezing profits at German sugar company Suedzucker (SZUG.DE), while Britain’s Tate & Lyle (TATE.L) on Thursday forecast sharply lower prices for its Splenda sweetener due to competition from cheaper Chinese sucralose makers. Both companies’ shares are down by double digits. “There are some very, very good businesses in that space, but I don’t think you can just bundle them all together, as you can see with Tate & Lyle,” said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Jeff Stent. “If you take a stock like Kerry, we’ve been buyers of that stock for as long as we’ve been analysts at Exane.” In developed markets, makers of everything from beer to bread to bodywash have lost some ground to generic, white-label products. But for the ingredients makers, those brands are customers. And in less mature markets, the growing customer base is local manufacturers. Kerry Group’s deal to supply dairy ingredients to Chinese infant nutrition company Beingmate shows how the sector can benefit from the development of local players who are stepping up their game against multinationals. Companies like Natura Cosmeticos (NATU3.SA) from Brazil and Grupo Bimbo (BIMBOA.MX) from Mexico are just two developing market consumer companies actively expanding into new markets. Analysts at Davy Research who follow the sector say that as local manufacturers get bigger and more savvy, they are turning to internationals for more reliable and high-quality supply. That is especially true in China, where a 2008 scandal involving tainted milk made consumers wary of local brands. China’s top milk producer, China Mengniu Dairy (2319.HK), this week agreed to sell more of itself to Danone as it tries to win customers. Denmark’s Arla Foods ARLAF.UL, another dairy supplier, also has a stake in Mengniu. <ID:L3N0LH37V> The average consumer goods maker spends about 8 to 10 percent or more of its sales on advertising and marketing and just 2 percent on research and development. Over time, R&D; spending has come down as categories mature and companies cut costs, leaving them to outsource technical development to their suppliers. “I think they have always been marketing companies,” said JPMorgan analyst John Faucher. “As the technologies and categories become more complicated, they simply need to cast a broader net.” By contrast, flavor and fragrance companies often spend more than 7 percent of sales on R&D;, and have been buying smaller makers of specialized ingredients for which they can charge higher prices and boost margins. “They want your M&M; to be the right blue and for the melt characteristics to be exactly right,” said a banker who has advised on deals in the sector. “They’re not trying to sell flour to bakers.” Last year, Tate & Lyle bought a maker of oat beta glucan, and in January IFF bought a maker of complex specialty ingredients, while Symrise is trying to take over Sweden’s Probi (PROB.ST), which makes probiotic ingredients for yoghurt. Israel’s Frutarom Industries (FRUT.TA) has bought 12 companies since 2011. A technical arsenal is handy as brands yield to more pressure to make their goods healthier or more natural. This month alone, Kraft Foods KRFT.O removed an artificial preservative from its Singles cheese, and U.S. Subway restaurants removed a chemical from its bread found in rubber yoga mats. A U.S. Senator has since called on regulators to ban the chemical. In that light, Tom Pirko of Bevmark Consulting said ingredients companies that are entrepreneurial and creative write their own tickets. “Those who foresee the future, are generally big winners.” ",2142014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ingredients-stocks-analysis/no-appetite-for-big-consumer-goods-try-their-suppliers-idUSBREA1D0QW20140214
287,PG,"Exclusive: P&G; eyes alumni, unit heads as candidates for CEO job","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) is considering current and former executives of the world’s largest household products maker as it begins the search for candidates to succeed Chairman and Chief Executive A.G. Lafley, according to sources familiar with the situation. P&G; veterans being considered as part of the succession planning process include Fabrizio Freda, who spent two decades at the company before becoming CEO of Estee Lauder Cos Inc (EL.N); and Susan Arnold, former president of global business units who is now an operating partner at private equity firm Carlyle Group LP (CG.O). Lafley is also closely watching the performance of some of his other direct reports for their potential to succeed him, the sources said. These executives include Melanie Healey, group president of North America; David Taylor, group president of global home care; and Deborah Henretta, group president of global beauty care; Martin Riant, the group president of global baby care; and Giovanni Ciserani, the group president of global fabric care. P&G; declined on Thursday to comment or to make executives available for interviews. No formal search process is currently under way, and the sources said Lafley could stay on for some time to come. Lafley, 66, was previously P&G;’s CEO from 2000 to 2009, but came out of retirement after his successor, Bob McDonald, was abruptly replaced last year amid pressure from investors who worried about its growth prospects and lagging share price. Since taking the helm, Lafley has conducted a “deep dive” to figure out what needs fixing. He re-organized P&G; into four businesses to boost efficiency. Last year, he said the fiscal 2014 year would be a transition year, with fiscal 2013 a “stepping stone.” In a telephone interview with Reuters last week, Freda declined to say whether he had been approached by the P&G; board. But he said, “I’m very happy at Estee Lauder Cos, and that’s what I’m doing and that’s what I am focused on and that’s what I plan to continue doing.” A representative for Arnold declined to comment. These new details about P&G;’s succession planning process suggest that the company, whose products including Tide detergent, Gillette razors and Pampers diapers are household names, is leaning toward choosing one of its own to be the next The sources said the appeal of hiring a former or current executive is that they would not only understand the complexities of a large multinational company with dozens of products but also understand its culture. Gary Stibel, founder and CEO of New England Consulting Group and a former P&G; executive, said the company is unlikely to select a candidate with no ties to it. “It is totally unnecessary, because they have so much internal talent competing for that job that it will be a challenge to select one,” Stibel said. P&G; has traditionally chosen CEOs and other top executives from within its management ranks. In 2009, Lafley picked McDonald, who was the chief operating officer at the time, to take over the company. McDonald struggled with a pullback in consumer spending in the aftermath of the financial crisis and the recession. In early 2012, he unveiled a $10 billion restructuring program, cutting thousands of jobs and taking other steps to improve operations, launch new products and expand into fast-growing emerging markets. Investors wanted faster improvements. Activist investor William Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management took a $2 billion stake in P&G; and began pushing for changes, saying shares were undervalued. (Ackman has since sold at least part of its stake.) P&G; shares underperformed those of rivals between the time McDonald was appointed in June 2009 and the announcement of his departure. During that time, P&G; rose about 50 percent, while Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N), for example, was up 74 percent and Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX index advanced 75 percent. “Bob retired, the board called me and I felt like duty called,” Lafley said in an interview when he returned in May 2013. Consultants and recruiters said they expect Lafley to remain in the top seat at P&G; for at least another 12 to 18 months. “It is still early. These changes don’t happen overnight. I think investors have a lot of confidence in him,” said Jason Tauber, an analyst for Neuberger Berman’s large cap disciplined growth team. Neuberger owns about 7 million P&G; shares. But as Lafley and the board consider a potential successor, they have to contend with investors increasingly eager to see what moves P&G; will make to speed up growth. Matt McCormick, a portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel, said shedding some business and making further progress on cost-cutting would help P&G.; “Procter is doing just fine - but when you look at their other competitors who have been able to surpass P&G;, the reason is they’re more nimble and they’re more adroit in adapting to shifts in consumer patterns,” said McCormick. Bahl & Gaynor owned 4.2 million P&G; shares as of September, according to Thomson Reuters data.

288,PG,Boring might be better for fund investors in 2014,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - With U.S. stocks doing a stutter-step after a five-year bull run, a shift into low-volatility funds might give you a little more traction if the market retrenches. Low or “minimum” volatility funds have become more popular since the 2008 meltdown. Buying mostly defensive stocks with high dividends and modest price variations, they represent an $11 billion market for moderately risk-averse investors. The most popular fund in this category, the PowerShares S&P; 500 Low-Volatility ETF, holds more than $3 billion in assets. It owns brand-name stocks like McDonald’s Corp and Johnson & Johnson, along with lesser-known companies like Sigma-Aldrich Corp. The fund, which charges 0.25 percent for annual management expenses, was up 14 percent for the year ended February 12. A similar fund is the iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ETF, which with slightly more than $2 billion in assets is a runner-up in terms of size in this group. It holds nearly half of its portfolio in consumer defensive, healthcare and financial services stocks like AT&T; Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and United Parcel Service Inc. The fund charges slightly less in annual expenses - 0.15 percent - and gained about 16 percent in the year through February 12. But both it and the PowerShares ETF are lagging the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index, which is up 22 percent for that period. Although it is too early to tell, low-volatility funds might have a distinct advantage if the bull cycle has reached or surpassed its peak. If corporate earnings falter or global economies slow, the market may tilt toward value and dividend-rich stocks. To date, though, the low-volatility advantage has yet to appear. Both the S&P; 500 and low-volatility shares are closely tracking each other, down slightly more than 1 percent year to date as of February 12. Despite the desire to time the top of a bull market, it is tough to make an exit from growth stocks into high-dividend shares. Market peaks are notoriously difficult to discern. The most pressing question for a long-term investor is whether to tilt more toward value than growth. Until this year, growth stocks have had their run of the roost, but value may dominate if fear stalks the market. It is typical for low-volatility funds to bulk up on boring, dividend-rich sectors like consumer durable, healthcare and utilities. The PowerShares fund, for example, has nearly half of its portfolio in those three groups. Both it and the iShares fund have yields north of 2 percent, which reflect the higher payouts of those kinds of companies. Yet what appears to be a virtue can be a disadvantage, particularly if the bull has room to run and the market will still favor growth stocks. By their very staid nature, low-volatility funds may not outpace the S&P; 500, which rose 32 percent last year with dividends reinvested, compared with 25 percent for the iShares fund. Instead of trying to guess where the market is going and reacting week to week, a dividend-growth strategy might prove potent in the long run. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index ETF, which I hold in my 401(k), lagged the S&P; 500 by only about 1 percentage point over the past three years. The Vanguard fund, which focuses on companies that consistently raise their dividends, is slightly more diversified than the other low-volatility funds I have mentioned. Its portfolio is more spread out among mega-, large- and medium-size companies with holdings like Abbott Laboratories, Procter & Gamble Co and PepsiCo Inc. It costs only 0.10 percent annually to own and was up 16 percent for the year ended February 12. Companies paying lower but growing dividends may also be bargains, Matt Freund, chief investment officer of USAA Funds in San Antonio, stated in a recent market commentary. “Companies increasing their dividend payments are making a commitment to the market,” Freund said. “They are telling investors that their business is strong enough to generate the free cash needed to pay higher dividends in the future.” Whatever path you take, do not confuse low-volatility funds with no volatility. All low-volatility stock funds will still react to market swoons. The Vanguard fund, for example, was down more than 3 percent year to date through February 12, compared with a 1.3 percent decline for the S&P; 500. Concentrating too much on defensive stocks will certainly create a drag on performance if growth still dominates, but that may not be a bad thing if you want to focus on total return over the long haul.

291,PG,P&G;'s smart toothbrush keeps tabs on tooth care,"LONDON (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co is bringing the dentist into the bathroom with the world’s first smartphone-connected toothbrush, a device that gives personalized advice to help people improve their brushing. The toothbrush, to be sold under P&G;’s Oral-B brand and which will be widely available from June, has a Bluetooth 4.0 link to a smartphone app that can be programmed with the help of a dentist, for example to pay more attention to any areas of the mouth being neglected, P&G; said. “The app provides real-time guidance,” Michael Cohen-Dumani, global associate director for Oral-B, told Reuters. “Dentists always tell us: ‘People do a great job in the week before they come to visit us and in the week after they visit us. But nothing can hide the fact that when we look inside the mouth we can see all the areas they miss’.” The toothbrush will be unveiled at the phone industry’s annual Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona next week, joining an expanding range of devices connected to smartphones that measure everything from sleep patterns and calorie intake to distance walked and exercise taken. Professionals had helped develop the app as a tool to manage their patients’ behavior between visits, Cohen-Dumani said. The app displays brushing progress in real time, telling the user when to move to a different part of the mouth and warning if they are brushing too hard, he said. “It will guide you in terms of how to brush, and you will be able to fully personalize the brushing routine for you,” Cohen-Dumani said. In tests, the app had extended average brushing times from less than a minute for a manual toothbrush to 2 minutes and 16 seconds, he said. The device will be at top end the Oral-B electric toothbrush range, with a recommended retail price of 199 pounds ($330) in Britain and 219 euros in Europe.

The device will be at top end the Oral-B electric toothbrush range, with a recommended retail price of 199 pounds ($330) in Britain and 219 euros in Europe. French startup Kolibree has also developed a connected electric toothbrush that it plans to launch in the third quarter, according to its website.",2202014,http://www.reuters.com/article/mobile-world-toothbrush/pgs-smart-toothbrush-keeps-tabs-on-tooth-care-idUSL6N0LM2CQ20140220
293,PG,US STOCKS-Tech leads Wall St lower as Ukraine casts a shadow,"* Ukraine conflict continues; Russia seizes marine base * Nasdaq hit as Internet, biotech names tumble * Procter & Gamble rallies and helps limit the Dow’s loss * Dow off 0.2 pct; S&P; 500 down 0.5 pct; Nasdaq off 1.2 pct   (Updates to close) By Angela Moon NEW YORK, March 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Monday, with some of the market’s recent best performers like technology and biotech shares leading the way down. Concerns that the crisis in Ukraine could escalate gave investors a reason to drop some of the market’s biggest trading favorites. The Nasdaq fell below its 50-day moving average earlier, in a sign of weakening near-term momentum. Netflix Inc tumbled 6.7 percent to close at $378.90, with fellow Internet names Facebook Inc down 4.7 percent at $64.10 and TripAdvisor Inc down 3.9 percent at $97.58. All three had scored sharp gains in 2013. The Nasdaq biotechnology index, which jumped 66 percent last year, fell 3 percent in its fourth straight daily decline. Over those four sessions, the biotech index slid 9 percent. On Friday, the index marked its worst day since October 2011. “Biotech stocks have gone parabolic over the past few months, so this is a necessary correction to that,” said Mark D’Cruz, senior investment analyst at Key Private Bank in Cleveland, Ohio. “A lot of that interest came from outside traditional biotech investors, who are now being scared off ... Biotechs really have to prove themselves this year, prove that their drugs can deliver.” Ukraine announced the evacuation of its troops from Crimea, essentially yielding the region to Russian forces, which seized a Ukrainian marine base. While few U.S. companies have excessive exposure to the region, investors are concerned about the potential economic fallout from any escalation in tensions. U.S. President Barack Obama, who has imposed personal sanctions against some of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s political and business allies, began crisis talks with his European allies over how to respond in the biggest East-West conflict since the Cold War. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 26.08 points or 0.16 percent, to end at 16,276.69. The S&P; 500 dropped 9.08 points or 0.49 percent, to finish at 1,857.44. The Nasdaq Composite slid 50.403 points or 1.18 percent, to close at 4,226.385. “The S&P; 500 is having a difficult time moving past its existing highs around 1,880. While the level represents a stunning rally of approximately 180 percent from the bottom set in March 2009, investors should be aware of the resistance the market is currently facing,” said Dan McElwee, executive vice president of Ventura Wealth Management in Ewing, New Jersey. On the New York Stock Exchange, decliners beat advancers by 1,924 to 1,142. On the Nasdaq, 1,960 stocks fell and 673 shares rose. The CBOE Volatility Index or the VIX, a widely used gauge of investor sentiment on Wall Street, rose 0.6 percent, but was still relatively subdued, at 15.09. The Dow’s losses were limited by a rise in Procter & Gamble Co, a consumer staple considered a defensive play. It rose 1.8 percent to $79.30, snapping a four-day losing streak. In the latest snapshot of the U.S. economy, financial data firm Markit said its preliminary read on March manufacturing activity slowed after nearing a four-year high last month. Markit, however, said the rate of growth and the pace of hiring remained strong. “For now, the U.S. economy continues to plug along, if not particularly robustly, then apparently well enough to keep markets happy,” said Jerry Webman, chief economist at OppenheimerFunds in New York. Herbalife Ltd said it would allow three more representatives of billionaire investor Carl Icahn, the company’s biggest shareholder, to join its board. Shares of the nutrition and weight-loss company jumped 6.7 percent to $52.86. NU Skin Enterprises Inc shares soared 18.2 percent to $88.66 on heavy volume. China fined the company $540,000 for illegal product sales and misleading local consumers, a smaller penalty than expected. Volume of about 6.4 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, slightly below the 6.9 billion average so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

In an all-cash deal, privately held Mars will buy the Iams brand, as well as Eukanuba and Natura, in the Americas and other selected countries, which account for 80 percent of P&G; Pet Care’s global sales. P&G; is seeking other buyers for those brands in European Union markets, which were excluded from this deal. Mars products range from candy like Mars bars and M&M;’s to food like Uncle Ben’s rice and chewing gum Extra and Orbit. Its pet care brands already include Pedigree, Whiska, and Royal Canin, and this deal will boost its market share as it vies with Nestle SA in the pet food market. Euromonitor International projects the global pet care industry will hit $76.8 billion in sales in 2014. P&G; products include Tide detergent, Gillette razors and Pampers diapers. The company has been under pressure to streamline its business from investors including activist investor William A. Ackman, who took a stake in P&G; in 2012. “Let’s be honest. Pet food hasn’t moved the needle for P&G;,” said Matt McCormick, a portfolio manager at Cincinnati-based Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel, which owns about 4.2 million P&G; shares. “I think P&G; needs to shrink to grow,” he said. P&G; has undertaken a multi-year restructuring program, cutting thousands of jobs and taking steps to streamline operations, launch new products and expand into fast-growing emerging markets. The exit from pet food was “an important step” toward focusing on core businesses, Chief Executive Officer A.G. Lafley said in a statement. According to Euromonitor, P&G; had just 4.7 percent of the global pet care market in 2012, the last year for which data was available. Mars had 23.4 percent of the global pet care market, putting it in a virtual dead heat with Nestle SA, maker of Purina, with a market share of 23.1 percent. Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj praised P&G;’s exit from pet food, which he called a “big distraction” that generates only about 2 percent of company sales, or an estimated $1.6 billion a year. P&G; does not break out results for its pet care business, which are accounted for in its larger health-care segment. But P&G;’s regulatory filings show the pet care volume decreased in the year ended in June 2013 because of competition and product recalls for Natura. The companies expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2014. P&G; said it did not expect the deal to hurt its forecast for core earnings growth per share for 2014 or have a material impact on 2015 results. Mars, controlled by the Mars family, had annual sales of more than $33 billion in 2013 and was ranked 5th in Forbes’ list of America’s largest private companies.

301,PG,"P&G; bets on new, expensive razor to attract consumers - WSJ","April 18 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co is planning to offer a new kind of razor, with a swiveling ball hinge and a pricey tag, to move forward with its strategy to push premium products, according to the Wall Street Journal on Friday . The world’s largest household products maker has seen sales of its Gillette razors suffer a hit in the fourth quarter of 2013 from the growing trend of sporting moustaches and stubble. The company’s Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller had in January blamed a movement by the Movember Foundation for weak razor sales. The non-profit organisation calls for men to grow moustaches during the month of November to raise awareness of men’s health issues, such as prostate cancer. P&G;’s Gillette planned to start shipping the new razor, called ProGlide FlexBall, on June 9, the WSJ said, quoting marketing documents. The razor’s ball hinge allows the blade to pivot and can lead to missing about 20 percent less hair with each glide. P&G; will offer manual and battery-powered versions of the FlexBall for suggested prices of $11.49 and $12.59 with one ProGlide cartridge, the report said. The company has a $188 million sales target for FlexBall for the first year.

302,PG,P&G; profits rise but still struggles for higher growth,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), the world’s largest household products maker, reported a higher quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by cost cutting and stronger sales of items like detergent and air freshener. But net sales in the third quarter were unchanged at $20.6 billion, disappointing investors looking for faster growth several years into P&G;’s efforts to focus on core products. Organic sales, which exclude the impact of divestitures and acquisitions, rose 3 percent, but a strong U.S. dollar wiped out those gains. Shares fell 1 percent to $79.85 in morning trading and one analyst said P&G; needs faster growth to lift shares. “We believe a sustained acceleration in organic growth toward the upper end of the 3 percent-4 percent range is necessary for material upside to the stock,” said Oppenheimer & Co analyst Joseph Altobello in a research note P&G; stock is 7 percent below a 52-week high in November. It has been under pressure to launch innovative products and streamline its businesses. Two weeks ago, P&G; said it was selling the bulk of its pet food business to Mars Inc for $2.9 billion. In recent years, it also sold its Folgers coffee brand and Warner Chilcott pharmaceuticals. Under a 5-year, $10 billion restructuring plan announced in February 2012, P&G; has sought to cut expenses by streamlining management, lowering overhead costs, cutting jobs and reducing marketing costs. Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told reporters the restructuring was running ahead of schedule. Organic sales in P&G;’s fabric care and home care division, which generates almost one third of sales, rose 6 percent. Brands in that category include Tide, Febreze air freshener and Duracell batteries. Grooming, its most profitable business, saw sales rise 1 percent. P&G;’s struggling beauty division, which includes Head & Shoulders and Olay, improved, with sales up 2 percent. The company has been pushing hard for market share in emerging markets. The effort is paying off. Organic sales in emerging markets rose 5 percent, compared to 1 percent in developed markets, Moeller said. But P&G;’s profit in those markets is lower given the money it is spending on marketing to establish itself. The maker of Pampers diapers and Tide detergent earned $2.61 billion, or $0.90 per share, in the fiscal third quarter ended March 31, up slightly from $2.57 billion, or $0.88 per share, a year earlier. Core earnings per share, excluding restructuring charges, rose 5 percent to $1.04, 3 cents better than expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. P&G; left its fiscal 2014 forecasts unchanged.

AT&T; Inc fell 3.8 percent to $34.92 a day after the Dow component reported earnings that beat expectations, offset by weak service revenue growth. Verizon Communications  shed 1 percent to $47.43 while the S&P; telecom sector index  dropped 2.2 percent, easily making it the session’s worst-performing sector. Biotech shares pulled the Nasdaq lower. Amgen Inc  slid 5 percent to $113.32, a day after earnings missed forecasts. The Nasdaq biotech index fell 1.5 percent and NYSEArca biotech index lost 1.6 percent. “You’ve got some big numbers coming out from companies that have already been pretty volatile in the Nasdaq, and there is some caution against the potential for shortfalls that could restart Nasdaq on the way down,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. “This is traditionally not going to be a particularly strong time for earnings reports, and it’s easy to take less inspiring numbers and say this market is overvalued or pass them by and say this is a seasonally low point. So it really is more about investors’ own view of how high a multiple they are willing to pay.” There were bright spots within biotech. Gilead Sciences Inc  rose 1.4 percent to $73.86 and Illumina Inc  gained 3.9 percent to $153.69 after the companies posted results late Tuesday. Boeing Co reported first-quarter revenue that beat expectations and lifted its core earnings forecast to reflect a tax settlement gain, sending its stock up 2.4 percent to $130.63 and giving the biggest boost to the Dow. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.72 points or 0.08 percent, to 16,501.65, the S&P; 500 lost 4.16 points or 0.22 percent, to 1,875.39 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 34.491 points or 0.83 percent, to 4,126.967. After the closing bell, Facebook Inc gained 2.2 percent to $62.69. Its mobile advertising business continued to accelerate in the first three months of the year, helping the Internet social networking company top Wall Street’s revenue target. Better-than-expected earnings have boosted Wall Street lately, though companies have largely been beating reduced forecasts. Profits are seen rising 1.6 percent this quarter, down from the 6.5 percent growth rate estimated at the start of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the 141 companies in the S&P; 500 that have posted results through Wednesday morning, 65.2 percent have topped expectations, above the long-term average of 63 percent. On the revenue side, 53.6 percent have exceeded forecasts, below the 61 percent long-term average. Procter & Gamble Co’s earnings topped forecasts but sales were flat. The stock slipped 0.3 percent to $80.36. New home sales tumbled more than expected to an eight-month low in March. The PHLX housing sector index fell 1.1 percent, with D.R. Horton Inc off 2.2 percent at $21.35. Volume was light, with about 5.63 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, well below the 6.65 billion average so far this month, according to BATS Global Markets. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,566 to 1,482, while on the Nasdaq, decliners beat advancers 819 to 1,775.

308,PG,Bayer nears deal to buy Merck consumer unit: sources,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - German drugmaker Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE) is nearing an agreement to buy Merck & Co Inc’s (MRK.N) consumer healthcare unit, people familiar with the matter said, in a deal that could value the business at around $14 billion. Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB.L), one of the final contenders in the auction, said on Wednesday it was no longer in active talks to buy the Merck business, leaving Bayer in the pole position to win the asset, which is best known for Coppertone sunscreen and Claritin allergy medicine. Bayer and Merck are hammering out final terms of an agreement and could announce the transaction in the next several days, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. Representatives for Bayer and Merck declined to comment. Reuters first reported last week that Bayer and Reckitt had emerged as forerunners in the auction with each offering roughly $13.5 billion, a price that could come close to $14 billion when the deal is finalized.. Bloomberg News reported on Thursday that Bayer entered exclusive talks with Merck. Bayer has also edged out other rival bidders in the auction, including Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis AG NOVN.VX and Sanofi SA (SASY.PA), people familiar with the matter said.

309,PG,UPDATE 2-Germany's Henkel expands laundry brands with $1.3 bln French deal,"* Second acquisition for Henkel this week * Henkel says more deals possible * Both deals expand position in existing categories, markets   (Adds details on BC Partners, background, context, byline) By Victoria Bryan and Martinne Geller FRANKFURT/LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - Henkel & Co  plans to buy French household cleaner maker Spotless, for 940 million euros ($1.28 billion) cash, its second purchase in a week as the German consumer goods company builds its presence in large, profitable, mature markets. Henkel is buying Spotless from London-based private equity firm BC Partners, adding Eau Ecarlate and Dylon laundry products to a portfolio that already includes Persil detergent, Loctite adhesives and Schwarzkopf hair products. Spotless will give it leading positions in established markets like France, Italy and Britain where home and personal care products enjoy relatively fat profit margins, Henkel said. The global consumer goods sector is seeing a spate of deals as tough economic conditions are leading small and mid-sized firms to seek entry into new markets or greater scale in existing, mature markets. Henkel’s latest acquisition follows a 270 million euros ($367.78 million) deal on Monday, to buy three U.S. hair care brands. Both purchases are being funded by a 4 billion euro ($5.45 billion) war chest the company has been building over several quarters for acquisitions. Henkel had been shopping for takeover targets for well over a year as a way to stay competitive in a consolidating consumer goods market increasingly fuelled by emerging markets. By 2016 it aims to have 20 billion euros in sales, up from 16.4 billion in 2013, with half of that coming from emerging markets. The price paid for Spotless, which includes debt, represents a multiple of 3.4 times sales and 12.1 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). That is higher than the 10 times sales and 1.7 times EBITDA Unilever  paid in 2010 for laundry and personal care brands from Sara Lee. Henkel itself trades for about 13.5 times EBITDA and has a market value of about $47 billion. “The acquisition seems to be rather expensive, but high valuation is justified, due to low volatility business profile and the emerging opportunity to increase market share in the highly competitive Western European laundry market,” wrote Equinet Bank analysts in a research note. According to Euromonitor International, the deal would slightly lift Henkel’s share of the $82 billion global laundry care market to 8.7 percent, still well behind Procter & Gamble’s  26.6 percent and Unilever’s 14.8 percent. Unilever sells Persil detergent in some markets. Consumer giants like Unilever, Nestle and Procter & Gamble are also taking advantage of high valuations to prune their portfolios and sharpen their focus on their most profitable businesses. Recent weeks have seen a bidding war for U.S. sausage maker Hillshire Brands, Japan’s Mizkan Group buying Unilever’s Ragu pasta sauce, Mars Inc buying P&G;’s pet food unit, L’Oreal  buying Chinese beauty mask maker Magic Holdings, and Emperador from the Philippines buying the Whyte & Mackay Scotch whisky business from United Spirits, controlled by Diageo. Despite Henkel’s deals this week, there could still be more, said a spokesman for the company, which pre-empted an auction for Spotless with an offer, according to a source close to the deal. BC Partners made a return of 2 times its original investment, according to the source. BC bought Spotless from Ardian, formerly Axa Private Equity, in 2010 for 640 million euros including debt. It has not taken any dividends from its investment, said the source. The deal is subject to approval by antitrust authorities and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2015. Henkel said it would add to earnings immediately. Henkel’s shares were up 0.5 percent at 85.69 euros at 0937 GMT, valuing the company at about $47 billion. BC Partners was advised by JP Morgan and Rothschild on the transaction.

310,PG,Obama to nominate former P&G; CEO Bob McDonald as veterans secretary,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama has chosen former Procter & Gamble Chief Executive Bob McDonald, an Army veteran, as his nominee to be the next secretary of veterans affairs, a senior Obama administration official said on Sunday. Obama’s announcement of McDonald, 61, will be made this week, possibly on Monday. If confirmed by the Senate, McDonald would be tasked with repairing the Veterans Administration after widespread evidence of delays in military veterans getting healthcare at VA facilities. The announcement is to come days after a White House review found significant and chronic failures across the board at the Veterans Administration and evidence that a “corrosive culture” prevails. A senior administration official said Obama was attracted to McDonald by his corporate background and military service. He would succeed Eric Shinseki, who resigned late in May after the depth of the VA’s problems became clear. McDonald is the former chairman, president and CEO of Procter & Gamble, having retired a year ago after 33 years with the Fortune 500 company, where he started as a brand assistant in 1980 and rose through the ranks. He served on the McKinsey Advisory Council, the Singapore International Advisory Council of the Economic Development Board, and on the boards of U.S. Steel and Xerox Corp. Officials believe his lengthy tenure at P&G; prepares him well for a huge agency with management challenges in providing services to more 8 million veterans a year. At P&G;, he oversaw more than 120,000 employees, with operations around the world, selling products in more than 180 countries. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner called McDonald “a good man, a veteran, and a strong leader with decades of experience in the private sector. With those traits, he’s the kind of person who is capable of implementing the kind of dramatic systemic change that is badly needed and long overdue at the VA.” But Boehner, the top Republican in Congress, added: “The next VA secretary can only succeed in implementing that type of change if his boss, the president, first commits to doing whatever it takes to give our veterans the world class health care system they deserve by articulating a vision for sweeping reform. Our nation’s veterans deserve nothing less.” After graduating in the top 2 percent of his class at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, McDonald served in the U.S. Army as a captain, primarily in the 82nd Airborne Division, and received the Meritorious Service Medal.    “Bob is an immensely gifted and caring individual.  That was evident to me when we first met as cadets at West Point, over 40 years ago,” retired Major General James “Spider” Marks said in a statement. “He came from a military family, and knows the challenges from living them.” Corporate colleagues of McDonald repeatedly cited his management abilities in grappling with large and complex organizations.     American Express Chief Executive Ken Chenault, who served on the P&G; board during McDonald’s time there, called McDonald a strong manager who knows how to make large organizations work effectively. “He’s an excellent choice to set the right course for the Veterans Administration at a difficult time,” Chenault said in a statement. The White House review, which was conducted by senior Obama aide Rob Nabors, said the agency’s 14-day scheduling standard for new patients to receive care was arbitrary, ill-defined and misunderstood. Obama accepted the findings on Friday by Nabors and acting Veterans Secretary Sloan Gibson, who said: “We can and must solve these problems as we work to earn back the trust of veterans.” ",6292014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-veterans/obama-to-nominate-former-pg-ceo-bob-mcdonald-as-veterans-secretary-idUSKBN0F40W820140629

312,PG,CORRECTED-Bayer broadens healthcare line by keeping Merck's consumer brands,"(Corrects fourth paragraph to read “portfolio acquired from Merck”, not “portfolio acquired by Merck”) * Coppertone, Dr. Scholl’s draw interest after $14 bln deal * Bayer says to hold on to non-drug consumer brands By Ludwig Burger and Arno Schuetze FRANKFURT, July 1 (Reuters) - German drugmaker Bayer said it would keep the Dr. Scholl’s and Coppertone brands it bagged as part of a $14 billion buy from U.S. Merck, despite overtures from companies keen to grab them, widening its healthcare line to include consumer goods. Just weeks after clinching the deal to buy Merck ‘s non-prescription drugs business, Bayer - best known as a life sciences company which makes cancer drugs - is being courted by rivals keen to acquire the foot care and sunscreen brands, several people with knowledge of the approaches told Reuters. But when asked about the expressions of interest for Dr. Scholl’s and Coppertone - each worth more than $1 billion - Bayer said it was not planning to untie the Merck bundle it secured in May in a competitive bidding tussle with Reckitt Benckiser, Procter & Gamble Co and Novartis . “We intend to keep the portfolio acquired from Merck & Co. as a core business,” Bayer said in a written statement. The German company, which makes contraceptives as well as prescription drugs against cancer, heart disease and multiple sclerosis, said when it bought the Merck business that its aim was to become global leader in over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. The deal was the largest in the German healthcare sector since Bayer bought rival Schering for 17 billion euros ($24 billion) in 2006. But with Bayer’s existing OTC medicines business listing products like aspirin and Canesten antifungal creams, some are questioning the logic of it wanting to keep everyday products like sunscreen. “They aren’t really part of the core business and don’t have much to do with medicines in the strict sense,” said Warburg Research analyst Ulrich Huwald. Offloading Dr. Scholl’s foot care and Coppertone, which account for 27 percent of the Merck bundle’s combined annual sales, would allow Bayer to focus on Merck’s core healthcare products such as allergy remedy Claritin and MiraLAX laxative, analysts say, and give it the resources to make the most of those brands. Repeated comments by chief executive Marijn Dekkers in the past that Bayer - the inventor of aspirin - is mainly about life sciences and molecular research, seem to have given hope to consumer goods companies that he might yet have wanted to part with brands that have little to do with healthcare. Reckitt Benckiser, which owns the Scholl foot care brand outside the United States, as well as Beiersdorf and L’Oreal were seen as potential acquirers. Officials at the three companies declined to comment. There are however sound reasons for Bayer to retain Coppertone and Dr. Scholl’s despite the products being so different to much of its other business: Big U.S. drug store chains such as Walgreen Co and CVS Caremark  prefer dealing with suppliers that can fill large amounts of shelf space and the two big consumer brands would add to Bayer’s bargaining power. Bayer has also said that the Merck deal, which is expected to close in the second half of the year, should allow it to make better use of its distribution network and sales force and give it more clout when dealing with retailers. There may however be another reason Bayer is reluctant to sell. Having bought Merck’s unit for more than twice the core earnings multiple at which Johnson & Johnson, the world’s largest consumer care company, is trading, any spin-off sales might reveal it to have overpaid. One source said Coppertone and Dr. Scholl’s, with $275 million and $309 million in 2013 sales, respectively, could be worth as much as $4 billion between them, reflecting the sales multiple of about 6.5 that Bayer paid for the entire Merck consumer bundle. But another person said that Dr. Scholl’s was more likely to fetch $1 billion to $1.5 billion, and Coppertone about $1 billion, because personal care products change hands for lower multiples than the medicines included in last month’s deal. Selling on some consumer brands for a lower earnings multiple than what was agreed for the entire Merck portfolio would exposed the high price paid for the remaining OTC drugs - and might not go down well with Bayer investors. “Shareholders would start to do the maths,” the source said.

313,PG,U.S. Senate panel unanimously approves Veterans Affairs nominee,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bob McDonald, President Barack Obama’s choice to run the Veterans Affairs Department, looked set for an easy Senate confirmation after the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee unanimously approved his nomination on Wednesday. McDonald, the former chief executive of consumer products giant Procter & Gamble Co, pledged to senators on Tuesday to bring corporate-style discipline, accountability and efficiency to the troubled agency, which has been rocked by healthcare waiting time scandals and accusations of mismanagement and fraud. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who is chairman of the veterans committee, said after the 14-0 vote that he expects   the full Senate to confirm McDonald as secretary of the department within days. McDonald, a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, served as an Army captain in the late 1970s before working his way through the Procter & Gamble ranks.  “Mr. McDonald brings us two very important qualities,” Sanders said. “Number one, he is familiar with the military because he served for many years and he brings a passion to take care of our veterans.” “The other quality that he brings is that he has been the CEO of a major American corporation and that experience gives him the tools to create a well-run and accountable VA,” Sanders added.

314,PG,UPDATE 1-U.S. Senate unanimously confirms McDonald to head veterans agency,"(Adds comment from veterans committee chairman, details on reform bill) WASHINGTON, July 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday unanimously confirmed Bob McDonald as the next Veterans Affairs secretary, pinning Washington’s hopes on the former Procter & Gamble Co chief executive to launch a massive turnaround effort at the troubled agency. McDonald, 61, replaces retired Army general Eric Shinseki, who resigned in late May amid a scandal over cover-ups of long waiting times for health-care appointments at VA hospitals and clinics across the country. The 97-0 vote to confirm McDonald comes a week after he pledged to bring corporate-style discipline and accountability to the agency, refocusing its 341,000 employees on serving veterans. “In the wake of the biggest scandal in the history of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Bob McDonald certainly has his work cut out for him,” House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller said after the Senate vote. “In order to be successful, McDonald will need to take swift and decisive action to discipline employees responsible for mismanagement, negligence and corruption that harms veterans while taking bold steps to replace the department’s culture of complacency with a climate of accountability,” Miller added. McDonald, a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point who served as P&G; CEO from 2009 to 2013, is widely expected to start his new job with an extra $17 billion at his disposal to reduce months-long health care wait times in new legislation slated for passage by Congress this week. The compromise measure reached by the leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives Veterans Affairs committees on Monday would allow veterans forced to wait more than 30 days for an appointment to seek care from private doctors at VA expense. It would provide $5 billion for the VA to hire more doctors and nurses and open 27 new clinics across the country. The measure also would give McDonald sweeping new authorities to fire or demote VA employees for poor performance, subject to a 21-day appeal process. To date, no one has been dismissed at VA over the misrepresentation of wait-time data. McDonald retired last year at P&G;, best known as the maker of Tide detergent, Gillette razors and Crest toothpaste, amid a major corporate restructuring as some institutional investors had pushed for faster improvements in profits and better stock performance. The company brought back McDonald’s predecessor,  Alan Lafley, to serve as its chairman and chief executive.

Data showing U.S. job growth slowed in July and the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose suggested the Federal Reserve has room to keep interest rates low for a while. The jobs growth, which came in below economists’ forecasts, relieved some investors worried about how soon the Fed could bump up interest rates after data on Thursday showed U.S. labor costs recorded their biggest gain in more than 5-1/2 years in the second quarter. But concern remained over Argentina’s debt problems after the country’s default earlier this week. A U.S. judge on Friday criticized Argentina’s decision to default and ordered negotiations between the country and holdout investors to continue. “Anytime a country defaults on its debt, it’s usually an unnerving event in the market. The risk-aversion people sell risky assets,” said Natalie Trunow, chief investment officer of equities at Calvert Investment Management in Bethesda, Maryland. But Trunow said the market dips should be seen as buying opportunities. “I don’t think we’re anywhere near the end of the expansion cycle.” Seven of the 10 S&P; 500 sectors ended lower, with S&P; financials among sectors with the biggest losses. JPMorgan Chase shares were down 2.1 percent at $56.48. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 69.93 points, or 0.42 percent, to 16,493.37, the S&P; 500 lost 5.52 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,925.15, and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 17.13 points, or 0.39 percent, to 4,352.64. For the week, the S&P; 500 fell 2.7 percent, its biggest weekly percentage loss since the week ending June 1, 2012. The Dow ended down 2.8 percent for the week, while the Nasdaq fell 2.2 percent. The Dow’s losses dragged it further into negative territory for the year. For the year-to-date, it is down 0.5 percent. Shares of Procter & Gamble Co, the world’s largest maker of household products, rose 3 percent to $79.65 and helped to support the Dow and S&P; 500 after it said it could sell about half of its brands in the next two years and cut jobs. Electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc’s  second-quarter revenue nearly doubled from the prior year, while its adjusted earnings topped expectations. Shares rose 4.5 percent to $233.27. In other economic data on Friday, a report from the Institute for Supply Management showed that manufacturing had its fastest expansion in more than three years in July. About 7.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Friday, above the 6.2 billion average for the last five days, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

The maker of Gillette razors and Tide detergent said it would consider selling about 90 to 100 brands whose sales have been declining for the past three years. P&G; said the 70 to 80 “core” brands it will focus on accounted for 90 percent of sales and more than 95 percent of profit over the past three years. Twenty-three of the brands have sales of between $1 billion and $10 billion. “Less will be much more,” Chief Executive A.G. Lafley said. P&G; did not name the brands it planned to sell, keep or discontinue, but Lafley told Reuters the company’s family, feminine and baby care business would lose fewer brands than its other four businesses. The business, which houses brands such as Pampers diapers and Always sanitary napkins, is P&G;’s fastest-growing and was the company’s second-biggest revenue contributor in the year ended June 30. P&G;’s top 80 brands had sales of about $84.1 billion in 2013 while the other roughly 100 brands had sales of just $2.4 billion, according to Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj. Dibadj expects the company to sell laundry brands Fab and Trojan, Perma Sharp shaving blades and Fekkai hair products among others. P&G; is unlikely to sell its Gillette, Tide, Pantene, Oral B, Olay and Old Spice brands, he said. P&G; said it would have fewer but larger distribution centers in North America and would focus on strengthening its presence in emerging markets, or what Lafley called the company’s “engines of growth”. Lafley told Reuters he expects the moves to result in fewer job cuts than the near 10,000 the company cut in 2002. P&G;’s revenue growth has been sluggish, with sales missing Wall Street’s estimates in nine of the last 13 quarters. The company says it has been hurt by “choppy” growth in developed markets, tough competition and a strengthening U.S. dollar. P&G; has sought to cut expenses by streamlining management, reducing costs and cutting jobs under a five-year, $10 billion restructuring plan announced in 2012. P&G;’s organic sales, which excludes divestitures and acquisitions, rose 2 percent in the fourth quarter, but currency losses wiped out the gains. Net sales fell 1 percent to $20.16 billion, missing the average analyst estimate. P&G; said it expected fiscal 2015 organic sales to rise by a low- to mid-single digit percentage and core earnings to rise by a mid-single digit. A 7 percent fall in operating expenses in the quarter helped P&G; post a core profit of 95 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 91 cents. “PG’s earnings quality is below its potential,” BMO Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. P&G;’s shares were up 3.5 percent at $80.03 in early afternoon trading on Friday.

Stocks rose as much as 0.3 percent before turning decisively lower, putting the S&P; 500 on track for its biggest weekly decline since May 2012. The U.S. Labor Department reported that 209,000 jobs were created in July, below the 233,000 that economists had expected, while data from the Institute for Supply Management showed that  manufacturing had its fastest expansion in more than three years in July. Strong economic data has recently been viewed as a sign that the Fed might raise rates sooner than previously anticipated. Fears of a rate hike sparked Thursday’s decline, which wiped out the Dow’s entire gains so far this year. “We have conflicting reports about when the Fed might or might not move, and on top of that we still have a lot of geopolitical issues that the market has to deal with,” said Nick Sargen, chief economist at Fort Washington Investment Advisors in Cincinnati. “I wouldn’t use this weakness to add to positions. We’re still not cheap by any means, and this could be the start of the 10 percent correction that’s been long overdue.” With the day’s decline, the S&P; 500 is about 3.6 percent away from the all-time closing high it posted on July 24. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 111.64 points, or 0.67 percent, to 16,451.66, the S&P; 500 lost 12.95 points, or 0.67 percent, to 1,917.72, and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 41.25 points, or 0.94 percent, to 4,328.53. Losses were broad, with more than 70 percent of companies traded on both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq lower. The only sectors to rise were defensive, with consumer staples  up 0.7 percent and utilities up 0.2 percent. For the week, the Dow is down 3 percent, the S&P; is down 3 percent, and the Nasdaq is down 2.7 percent. Two Dow components reported earnings that topped expectations. Procter & Gamble Co, the world’s largest maker of household products, which also said it could sell about half of its brands, rose 3.5 percent to $80, boosting consumer staples, while Chevron fell 1.2 percent to $127.65. Scientific Games Corp rose 4.3 percent to $8.91 after it said it would buy Bally Technologies Inc for $3.27 billion. Bally jumped 30 percent to $77.95. Electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc posted second-quarter revenue that nearly doubled from the prior year, while its adjusted earnings topped expectations. Shares rose 2.9 percent to $229.91. Among other data, financial data firm Markit said factory activity expanded in July, though the pace of growth slipped from the prior month. U.S. consumer sentiment edged down in July, according to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, modestly missing expectations.  June construction spending fell 1.8 percent, far from the 0.5 percent rise that had been expected.

Futures had indicated a second straight day of sharp losses following Thursday’s selloff, which was spurred by concerns of a sooner-than-expected rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Data showed 209,000 jobs were created in July, below the 233,000 that was expected. Analysts had speculated that a stronger-than-expected report would give the Fed flexibility to hike rates. Such a move would raise borrowing costs for individuals and companies and crimp spending, which could impact economic growth. The jobs report “won’t force the Fed to raise rates any time soon, and given all the fear that was out there yesterday, it makes sense to me that futures would come back so strongly,” said Mark Grant, managing director at Southwest Securities in Fort Lauderdale. Other data pointed to improving economic conditions, including the Institute for Supply Management’s read on manufacturing, which expanded at the fastest pace in more than three years in July. Factory activity expanded in July, according to financial data firm Markit, though the pace of growth slipped from the prior month. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 25.11 points or 0.15 percent, to 16,538.19, the S&P; 500 gained 0.45 points or 0.02 percent, to 1,931.12 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 4.77 points or 0.11 percent, to 4,365.00. The day’s top-performing sectors were all defensive, which tend to outperform in periods of economic uncertainty. Consumer staples rose 1.1 percent as the strongest group on the day, followed by utilities, up 1 percent. Energy shares, a cyclical group that is tied to the pace of economic growth, were the weakest, off 0.6 percent. Thursday’s decline was the biggest one-day drop for the S&P; since April, and it turned the Dow negative for the year. Despite Friday’s rebound, the S&P; remained under its 50-day moving average, a sign of weak near-term trends. For the week, the Dow is down 2.6 percent, the S&P; is down 2.5 percent and the Nasdaq is down 2 percent. It is the biggest weekly decline for all three since April. A pair of Dow components reported earnings that topped expectations, with Procter & Gamble Co rising 3.4 percent to $79.93 but Chevron dipping 0.8 percent to $128.16. Scientific Games Corp rose 11 percent to $9.50 after it said it would buy Bally Technologies Inc for $3.27 billion. Bally jumped 30 percent to $77.95.

Healthcare giants including Merck & Co, Abbott Laboratories and GlaxoSmithKline Plc have also moved to shed their declining mature drug businesses in recent months. P&G; says it has been hurt by “choppy” growth in developed markets, tough competition and a strengthening U.S. dollar. The company has sought to cut expenses by streamlining management, reducing costs and cutting jobs under a five-year, $10 billion restructuring plan announced in 2012.

335,PG,"Exclusive: P&G;, Hasbro in crosshairs of Mexico's taxman - sources","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The world’s largest household product maker Procter & Gamble and No. 2 toymaker Hasbro are at the heart of a Mexican probe into tax avoidance that could cost the firms hundreds of millions of dollars in back-taxes between them, sources told Reuters.  In January, Mexico said it had launched a probe of 270 companies for allegedly exploiting tax loopholes that have leaked income out of Mexico for years.  At first, seven multinationals were the focus of the government’s “informal audit,” led by Oscar Molina, who audits big companies at Mexico’s tax collection agency SAT. But Molina says he is in advanced discussions with two companies to pay more income tax for prior years.  He didn’t name them but said one of the two has been involved in litigation since 2005 over the extent of its taxable presence in Mexico. The other, he said, has been less aggressive and had made gradual changes to its tax scheme.  Five sources have told Reuters the firms are Hasbro and P&G.; In its 2014 second quarter report released in July, Hasbro said it is defending itself against outstanding tax assessments by Mexican authorities totaling about $250 million for the 2000 to 2007 period related to how it accounts for cross-border transactions, known as transfer pricing issues. “The company is party to discussions with the Mexican tax authorities to determine if the two parties can reach an agreed settlement of these issues,” Hasbro said in the filing.  It said it has made a settlement offer to authorities without specifying the amount. SAT says the probe, which still includes a handful of firms, involves examining corporate structures that ensure profits based on Mexican manufacturing activities or sales to Mexican customers are reported in offshore units, beyond the reach of the Mexican tax authority.  Molina is arguing that these offshore units which derive profits from economic activity in Mexico, had a de facto taxable residence or permanent establishment in Mexico and so, he can tax their Mexico-related profit. Tax authorities in Spain, France and Norway have previously gone to court to argue a multinational using such profit shifting structures, had a deemed permanent establishment in their countries.  However, those efforts largely failed, which is partly why countries are now pressing for changes in international tax rules which would bring profits shifted offshore by convoluted arrangements back within reach of tax authorities. Mexico levies 30 percent income tax on firms, above OECD countries’ average of 25 percent.  “We are working under the understanding that there is permanent establishment,” Molina said in a June interview about the probe. “They send away part of the income. And we say: No, no, no. Your income is bigger than that. And it is because of your permanent establishment.” P&G; and Hasbro declined to comment on whether they are being probed. Neither company revealed their tax obligations in Mexico. Hasbro spokeswoman Julie Duffy said that the global toymaker is often involved in tax audits around the world. P&G; spokeswoman Jennifer Corso said in an email that the company pays all taxes owed in more than 150 tax jurisdictions and does not pursue aggressive tax planning.      Ohio-based P&G;, the maker of Gillette razors and Tide detergent, employs about 7,000 people at eight plants, two distribution centers and an office in Mexico, the company said. An undated confidential document that a source said P&G; submitted to the Mexican government last year described the company’s operations in Mexico. It was reviewed by Reuters and shows about $1 billion in revenue and some $3 billion in exports from P&G; Mexico in 2012.  Neither Hasbro nor P&G; have said how much income tax they pay annually in Mexico. SAT would not say how much it believed the two companies it is in advanced talks with should pay.  Hasbro, known for its My Little Pony toys and Transformers action figures, generates nearly $200 million in Mexican sales annually, according to a confidential document, also undated and about its operations in Mexico, that the source said the firm presented to the government in 2013. The toymaker has offices in Mexico City, a distribution center and sales personnel in five cities, the document said. The Rhode Island based-firm, which trails only Mattel in the world toy market according to Euromonitor, says it has 245 employees in Mexico.  Mexico’s actions reflect growing frustration among some large developing countries, including China and India, with legal loopholes in international tax rules that companies can exploit to shift profits to tax havens. Mexico’s SAT argues that by doing so, some companies are avoiding their tax dues.  In 2012, the group of 20 leading economies stepped up efforts to crack down on corporate tax dodging, after reports of firms like Apple and Google using complex structures to slash their tax bills sparked outrage.  The G20 asked the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) to review the rules on how multinationals are taxed, emboldening Mexico to pursue its own tax avoidance probe.  Mexico, a haven for auto manufacturers and light assembly plants, has the lowest tax take in the OECD, crimping its ability to spend on programs vital to boosting economic growth and living standards.  The main factor in determining whether a company has a taxable presence or a “permanent establishment” in a country is the extent of its sales operations there.     But loopholes allow companies to avoid hefty levies in high-tax countries where they generate big sales revenue, for example, by signing sales contracts abroad. Molina said he could complete formal audits of the firms he is in advanced talks with quickly and go to court if they don’t reach a deal.

337,PG,SCA says ready to fight P&G; in incontinence care market,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden’s SCA, the world’s biggest maker of incontinence pads, is accelerating product upgrades and boosting promotions to counter the re-entry of U.S. personal care giant Procter & Gambler into the market, its CEO told Reuters. However, Jan Johansson brushed off some analysts’ advice that he should respond with a change in strategy, such as extending one of SCA’s feminine care brands into incontinence.  “We’ve known about this for quite some time, longer than the market. Our concern was that they’d come out with an entirely new product range that we don’t have,” he said in an interview.  “But there was no innovation that we didn’t know about.” SCA accounts for about a quarter of the global market for adult diapers, with its top-selling Tena brand making more than 10 billion crowns ($1.4 billion) of sales a year, out of a group total of 89 billion crowns last year.   The firm’s shares have fallen around 16 percent since P&G; hinted in June — and then confirmed in August — that it would return to the incontinence care market after a 15 year absence.  P&G; has begun rolling out in Europe, where SCA has the bulk of business, and the United States.             Handelsbanken analyst Karri Rinta, who has an accumulate rating on SCA’s shares, has warned SCA could lose 30 percent of its operating profit from incontinence products in 2016 due to P&G;’s extension of its well-established feminine care brand Always into the market.  However, Johansson said analysts were underestimating the strength of the Tena brand and that SCA would be able to defend its position with product upgrades and innovations.  He said it had brought forward upgrades, such as a higher-and-faster absorption pad for people who suffer incontinence during a sudden sneeze. It has also reallocated resources from advertising toward promotions in order to match P&G;’s offers.  Aging populations and the fact incontinence is also widespread among younger adults, most of which don’t use incontinence pads, means it is a market with huge potential, Johansson added.  SCA estimates that less than 40 percent of sufferers in Europe use incontinence pads or pants, with fewer than 5 percent of incontinent men using the products.  SCA, which started out as a forestry company in 1929 and makes the largest share of its revenues from tissues, sells most of its incontinence products directly to the healthcare industry, with less than 30 percent of revenues from retailers.  P&G;, which made net sales of $83 billion in its latest financial year, is focusing on the retail market for now.  Johansson dismissed the idea of investing heavily in one of SCA’s feminine care brands and, once it was bigger, extending it into incontinence products for the retail market.   “Tena is much stronger (than SCA’s feminine care brands) so it would be daft to change brand,” he said.     Johansson also said he had no plans to shift focus more to emerging markets at the expense of Europe. “Europe, too, is a fantastic growth market as long as we find a good way to increase penetration. (P&G;’s entry) means more competition, but also helps drive penetration,” he said. Independently of P&G;’s return, SCA is investing online, where it sees a big potential market due to the embarrassment felt by some incontinence sufferers when buying products in store. The firm has its own online stores in several markets. ",10162014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sca-incontinence/sca-says-ready-to-fight-pg-in-incontinence-care-market-idUSKCN0I51D020141016

340,PG,RPT-UPDATE 1-Luxottica names P&G; executive as proposed new co-CEO,"(Repeats with no change to text) By Valentina Za MILAN, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Luxottica, the world’s largest eyewear group, named a senior Procter & Gamble  manager as its new co-chief executive on Wednesday, seeking to solve a governance crisis after losing two chief executives in the span of six weeks. The maker of Ray-Ban and Oakley sunglasses said its chairman would propose at a board meeting on Oct. 29 that Adil Mehboob-Khan be appointed as co-CEO in charge of markets from January and in the interim joins the board as a non-executive director. The move follows last week’s abrupt departure of the last CEO, Enrico Cavatorta, who only six weeks earlier had taken over from long-time boss Andrea Guerra. Both executives have clashed with Luxottica’s chairman and majority owner Leonardo Del Vecchio, 79, who has temporarily taken on management of the group. Del Vecchio now plans to hand all executive responsibilities to Chief Operating Officer Massimo Vian, who will become co-CEO in charge of operations and products once Mehboob-Khan joins, the company said. The chairman had already intended to put Vian in charge until the second co-CEO was found but had to shelve that plan only a day after unveiling it following a board clash. Del Vecchio said on Wednesday the naming of Vian as co-CEO guaranteed “continuity with the existing strategy.” “At the same time, Adil’s appointment as  Co-CEO for Markets will bring fresh energy,” he added in a statement. Mehboob-Khan is set to leave Procter & Gamble on Jan. 1 after 27 years, the U.S. company said in a separate statement. Over the past three years, the London-born executive has led professional haircare brand Wella, where he will be replaced by Global Group President Patrice Louvet, P&G; said. Luxottica adopted plans for a dual chief executive model after Guerra’s departure, drawing criticism from some analysts who said the structure hampered decision-making. Guerra, widely considered one of Italy’s best top managers, presided over a doubling of group sales to 7.3 billion euros. The subsequent departure of Cavatorta, Luxottica’s trusted chief financial officer since 1999, has further stoked investors’ concerns and hastened Luxottica’s search for a new co-CEO after the group had previously said it would take time. Luxottica, 61 percent owned by Del Vecchio, is due to publish third-quarter results on Oct. 29 and it has forecast a net profit rise of around 10 percent as a stronger dollar boosts U.S. sales. “We believe though that all eyes will be on corporate governance as the investor community will be seeking answers on the recent management changes and on the reasons behind Cavatorta’s unexpected decision to leave,” JP Morgan analysts said in a note earlier this week.

The move follows last week’s abrupt departure of the last CEO, Enrico Cavatorta, who only six weeks earlier had taken over from long-time boss Andrea Guerra. Both executives have clashed with Luxottica’s chairman and majority owner Leonardo Del Vecchio, 79, who has temporarily taken on management of the group. Del Vecchio now plans to hand all executive responsibilities to Chief Operating Officer Massimo Vian, who will become co-CEO in charge of operations and products once Mehboob-Khan joins, the company said. The chairman had already intended to put Vian in charge until the second co-CEO was found but had to shelve that plan only a day after unveiling it following a board clash. Del Vecchio said on Wednesday the naming of Vian as co-CEO guaranteed “continuity with the existing strategy.” “At the same time, Adil’s appointment as  Co-CEO for Markets will bring fresh energy,” he added in a statement. Mehboob-Khan is set to leave Procter & Gamble on Jan. 1 after 27 years, the U.S. company said in a separate statement. Over the past three years, the London-born executive has led professional haircare brand Wella, where he will be replaced by Global Group President Patrice Louvet, P&G; said. Luxottica adopted plans for a dual chief executive model after Guerra’s departure, drawing criticism from some analysts who said the structure hampered decision-making. Guerra, widely considered one of Italy’s best top managers, presided over a doubling of group sales to 7.3 billion euros. The subsequent departure of Cavatorta, Luxottica’s trusted chief financial officer since 1999, has further stoked investors’ concerns and hastened Luxottica’s search for a new co-CEO after the group had previously said it would take time. Luxottica, 61 percent owned by Del Vecchio, is due to publish third-quarter results on Oct. 29 and it has forecast a net profit rise of around 10 percent as a stronger dollar boosts U.S. sales. “We believe though that all eyes will be on corporate governance as the investor community will be seeking answers on the recent management changes and on the reasons behind Cavatorta’s unexpected decision to leave,” JP Morgan analysts said in a note earlier this week.

The Milan-based company said in a statement P&G;’s Adil Mehboob-Khan would flank Massimo Vian, the group’s Chief Operating Officer who Luxottica said last week would become co-CEO in charge of operations and product. Chairman Leonardo Del Vecchio will propose at a board meeting on Oct. 29 to temporarily entrust all executive responsibilities to Vian making him CEO of the group until Mehboob-Khan’s arrival. Del Vecchio, who owns 61 percent of Luxottica, will also propose the board next week to appoint Mehboob-Khan as non-executive board member.

348,PG,P&G; to exit Duracell battery business; quarterly sales dip,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co on Friday said it would sell its Duracell battery business, probably through a split-off into a separate company, as it looks to focus on faster-growing brands. P&G; shares rose about 3 percent as investors shrugged off a marginal fall in quarterly sales and warning that a stronger dollar would significantly hurt revenue and earnings this quarter. A surging U.S. currency, reduces the value of overseas sales when they are translated back into U.S. dollars.  P&G; and Colgate-Palmolive Co, which on Friday reported a 17 percent drop in third-quarter profit and lowered its full-year earnings forecast, are the latest companies to be hurt by a stronger dollar.  Emerging markets generate about 50 percent of Colgate’s sales and about 39 percent of P&G;’s revenue comes from developing markets.     The world’s No. 1 household products maker said in August it could sell about half of its slow-growing brands in the next two years. Duracell, the world’s No. 1 battery business, was widely considered to be one of the largest assets that P&G; was likely to divest.  On a conference call, Chief Financial Officer John Moeller said the company had sold or discontinued 11 brands in the latest quarter and 25 in the last five quarters. Analysts expect it to sell laundry brands Fab and Trojan, Perma Sharp shaving blades and Fekkai hair products, among others.  Demand for Duracell’s mainstay non-rechargeable, disposable alkaline batteries has waned while a worldwide explosion in electronic devices has increased demand for re-chargeable batteries. P&G;, whose brands include Pampers diapers and Tide detergent, said it would first sell its interest in a China-based battery joint venture for an undisclosed amount and then exit Duracell completely. The company said it was looking to split Duracell off into a stand-alone company but would consider alternatives that offer better value to shareholders. Under the split-off, expected in the second half of 2015, P&G; shareholders would be able to exchange some, none or all of their stock for shares of Duracell. P&G; said it expected the percentage growth in its net sales in fiscal 2015 to be little changed or rise in the low single digits, including a 2 percentage point negative impact from a strong dollar.  Net income attributable to P&G; fell to $1.99 billion, or 69 cents per share, in the first quarter ended Sept. 30 from $3.03 billion, or $1.04 per share, a year earlier.  Core earnings, excluding the currency impact, were $1.07 per share, in line with the analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales dipped to $20.79 billion from $20.83 billion due to currency fluctuations and divestitures. Organic sales, excluding those effects, increased 2 percent. Shares of P&G; were up 2.6 percent at $85.41 at midday.

354,PG,"UPDATE 1-Colgate profit down on weak Brazil, China demand; warns on dollar","(Adds estimates, details, shares) Oct 24 (Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co reported a 17 percent drop in third-quarter profit and lowered its full-year earnings forecast, hurt by weak demand in Brazil and China and a stronger U.S. dollar. Shares of the company, whose profit has fallen in four of the past six quarters, fell 2 percent before the bell on Friday. The stronger dollar will slow the company’s full-year profit per share growth to 3-4 percent, Colgate said. It had previously expected a 4-5 percent growth. U.S. companies with big international operations are having to adjust to a new environment after more than a decade of reaping the benefits of a relatively weak dollar on earnings. Emerging markets, which generate about 50 percent of Colgate’s net sales, have weakened in the past few months, with Brazil slipping into recession and China facing what is said to be its worst slowdown in 24 years. Colgate, which controls nearly 45 percent of the global toothpaste market, said net sales in Latin America fell 4.5 percent in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Procter & Gamble Co, the world’s largest household products maker, reported a slight fall in quarterly sales on Friday and said a stronger dollar would significantly hurt revenue and earnings in the current quarter. Colgate’s net income fell to $542 million, or 59 cents per share, in the quarter, from $656 million, or 70 cents per share, a year earlier. Worldwide net sales fell marginally to $4.38 billion. Organic sales, which strip out the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, rose 3.5 percent. Excluding items, the company earned 76 cents per share, in line with analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of the company, which have lost about 4.5 percent in the past three months, closed at $65.05 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.

356,PG,"Argentina accuses Procter & Gamble of tax fraud, says suspends operations","(Reuters) - Argentina has accused Procter & Gamble, the world’s No. 1 household products maker, of tax fraud and said it suspended its operations in the South American country, according to a statement issued on Sunday by the country’s AFIP tax authority. It was unclear what the government meant by suspended, and the company declined to comment on whether its operations had been halted.   Argentina accused the company of over-billing $138 million in imports to get money out of the country, according to the statement, which was published on Argentina’s presidential website (www.prensa.argentina.ar). “P&G; funneled currency abroad and hid income that was subject to tax in Argentina,” it said. “We have to put an end to these tricks used by international companies,” the statement added. Procter & Gamble spokesman Paul Fox said the company is working to understand fully the allegations and resolve them. “We don’t pursue aggressive tax/fiscal planning practices as they simply don’t produce sustainable results,” he said adding the consumer products maker values its relationship with the country and its consumers.  Procter & Gamble has been operating in Argentina since 1991 and currently runs three manufacturing plants and two distribution centers. In 2006, Cincinnati-based P&G; bowed to pressure from the Argentinian government and froze prices of 31 products including shampoos, soaps and cream for at least a year in an effort to help the government combat inflation. The company, which does not break down revenue by country but does so by region, said in its 2014 annual report that Latin America contributed 10 percent to overall company revenue. P&G; reported net sales of $83.1 billion in 2014.    Argentina has restrained access to foreign currency in a bid to retain central bank reserves, which have fallen 17 percent over the last 12 months to about $28 billion. The country has been banished from the international capital markets since its 2002 default on about $100 billion in bonds, compounded by another sovereign default in July.

359,PG,P&G; will not lay off staff in Argentina due to tax probe -source,"BUENOS AIRES, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co, the world’s No. 1 household products maker, has no plans to lay off staff in Argentina despite having to suspend commercial operations in the country while it grapples with a tax fraud probe, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. P&G; employees are showing up for work and carrying out tasks not related to the sale and purchase of goods, while the company continues talks with the Argentine tax authority, AFIP, in an attempt to defuse the situation, the source told Reuters. Argentina accused P&G; on Sunday of hiding income and over-billing $138 million in imports to get money out of the South American country, which has stringent capital controls in place to protect its fast-dwindling foreign reserves. Argentina’s leftist government, which favors strong intervention in the private sector, has publicly accused a host of major foreign companies such as global grains exporters Bunge and Cargill of evading taxes over the past few years. Such investigations are usually resolved with a hefty fine, with the companies resuming business as usual before any real toll is taken on operations or profits. “It is commercial operations that have been stopped. The company cannot import, export or sell its products. But that does not affect day-to-day work at P&G;,” the source said. “Employees continue to work and there are no thoughts of firing anyone.” Many other companies including foreign giants such as Anglo-Dutch Unilever supply Argentine supermarkets with some of the same household goods as P&G;, meaning that even if the tax probe drags on, there is little risk of shortages. P&G;, which earlier this year came under the scrutiny of Mexican authorities for alleged tax avoidance, said on Monday it had paid all taxes owed in Argentina but was “working to more fully understand the concerns and to constructively resolve them”. Cincinnati, Ohio-based P&G;, maker of Gillette razors and Tide detergent, has more than 1,200 employees in Argentina, where it runs three manufacturing plants and two distribution centers. The company’s Argentine operations contribute about 1 percent to its overall sales. P&G; reported net sales of $83.1 billion in 2014. Argentina’s cash-strapped government has been ramping up state intervention in the economy, Latin America’s third largest, in an attempt to prevent its latest debt default from triggering a balance of payments crisis.

363,PG,Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway buys P&G;'s Duracell,"(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc has agreed to acquire Procter & Gamble Co’s Duracell battery unit in a complex transaction that lets Berkshire Chairman Warren Buffett buy a business he has supported for two decades and shave his company’s tax bill. Rather than pay cash, Berkshire (BRKa.N) will give P&G; $4.7 billion of the shares it now owns in the world’s largest consumer products company. P&G; (PG.N) will infuse $1.8 billion in cash into Duracell before the expected closing in the second half of 2015. The transaction announced on Thursday helps P&G; Chief Executive A.G. Lafley streamline his Cincinnati-based company by shedding slow-growing brands and focus on about 80 brands that generate most of its profit and revenue. P&G;’s better-known products include Tide laundry detergent and Pampers diapers. Buffett, meanwhile, avoids a big tax bill that Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire might have incurred if it sold its P&G; shares. Both P&G; and Berkshire shares hit a record high this week. Buying Duracell is a “brilliant move,” said Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management in Palm Beach, Florida, and is a longtime Berkshire critic who is selling its shares short. “Warren loves mature and durable consumer brands that produce predictable cash flow. Duracell fits the bill,” Kass added. “And accomplishing this in a tax-efficient transaction.” Berkshire has said it paid just $336 million for its 1.9 percent stake in P&G;, equal to 52.8 million shares on June 30. Assuming a 35 percent tax rate on corporate capital gains, the swap could save Berkshire more than $1 billion, on top of tax savings from two similar transactions earlier this year. Berkshire’s income tax bill was $8.95 billion in 2013, or 31 percent of pretax earnings. Duracell, whose batteries are known for their copper-colored tops, gives Buffett a familiar name to add to Berkshire’s stable of more than 80 businesses, including Benjamin Moore paint, the Dairy Queen ice cream chain and Heinz ketchup. “I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G; and Gillette,” Buffett said in a statement. [ID:nBw5J6R8za] Some analysts questioned why Berkshire views Duracell as a good fit, while P&G; does not. While Duracell has more than one-fourth of the global market for batteries, demand has slackened amid the growth in smartphones and other devices that rely on rechargeable power sources. “It is a good thing that P&G; is moving swiftly to divest its non-core brands,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said. “I don’t take it as a good sign that Buffett would rather own Duracell than P&G.;” Buffett’s assistant did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. In afternoon trading, Berkshire’s Class A shares were up 0.4 percent at $218,912, while P&G; fell 0.7 percent to $88.87. Berkshire has owned P&G; stock since P&G; bought Gillette Co in 2005. Buffett had invested in Gillette since 1989. Buffett was about halfway through a 14-year stint on Gillette’s board when that company agreed to buy Duracell for $7 billion in stock in 1996. That’s more than twice what Berkshire is paying, after accounting for the cash infusion. Buffett prefers owning businesses, especially if they are easy to understand and have strong competitive advantages, to the underlying stock. Earlier this year, Buffett swapped stock of Phillips 66 (PSX.N) for a unit that makes chemicals for pipelines, and stock of Graham Holdings Co (GHC.N), which once published the Washington Post, for a Miami TV station and other assets. Buffett has plenty of ammunition to buy more businesses:  Berkshire had $62.38 billion in cash as of Sept. 30. P&G; will take a noncash charge of 28 cents per share to write down goodwill and intangible assets, and adjust fiscal 2014 results to reflect Duracell as a discontinued operation. Shares of Energizer Holdings Inc (ENR.N), Duracell’s main rival, rose as much as 4.7 percent to a record high before easing to $128.43, up 2.6 percent. UBS household products analyst Stephen Powers said private equity investors might look for value in Energizer, given how Buffett proved “willing and eager” to buy Duracell.

367,PG,UPDATE 5-Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway buys P&G;'s Duracell,"* Buffett to return $4.7 billion worth of shares to P&G; * Purchase is “brilliant move” for Buffett - money manager   (Adds link to Breakingviews column) By Jonathan Stempel and Devika  Krishna Kumar Nov 13 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc has agreed to acquire Procter & Gamble Co’s Duracell battery unit in a complex transaction that lets Berkshire Chairman Warren Buffett buy a business he has supported for two decades and shave his company’s tax bill. Rather than pay cash, Berkshire will give P&G; $4.7 billion of the shares it now owns in the world’s largest consumer products company. P&G; will infuse $1.8 billion in cash into Duracell before the expected closing in the second half of 2015. The transaction announced on Thursday helps P&G; Chief Executive A.G. Lafley streamline his Cincinnati-based company by shedding slow-growing brands and focus on about 80 brands that generate most of its profit and revenue. P&G;’s better-known products include Tide laundry detergent and Pampers diapers. Buffett, meanwhile, avoids a big tax bill that Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire might have incurred if it sold its P&G; shares. Both P&G; and Berkshire shares hit a record high this week. Buying Duracell is a “brilliant move,” said Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management in Palm Beach, Florida, and is a longtime Berkshire critic who is selling its shares short. “Warren loves mature and durable consumer brands that produce predictable cash flow. Duracell fits the bill,” Kass added. “And accomplishing this in a tax-efficient transaction.” Berkshire has said it paid just $336 million for its 1.9 percent stake in P&G;, equal to 52.8 million shares on June 30. Assuming a 35 percent tax rate on corporate capital gains, the swap could save Berkshire more than $1 billion, on top of tax savings from two similar transactions earlier this year. Berkshire’s income tax bill was $8.95 billion in 2013, or 31 percent of pretax earnings. Duracell, whose batteries are known for their copper-colored tops, gives Buffett a familiar name to add to Berkshire’s stable of more than 80 businesses, including Benjamin Moore paint, the Dairy Queen ice cream chain and Heinz ketchup. “I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G; and Gillette,” Buffett said in a statement. Some analysts questioned why Berkshire views Duracell as a good fit, while P&G; does not. While Duracell has more than one-fourth of the global market for batteries, demand has slackened amid the growth in smartphones and other devices that rely on rechargeable power sources. “It is a good thing that P&G; is moving swiftly to divest its non-core brands,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said. “I don’t take it as a good sign that Buffett would rather own Duracell than P&G.;” Buffett’s assistant did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. In afternoon trading, Berkshire’s Class A shares were up 0.4 percent at $218,912, while P&G; fell 0.7 percent to $88.87. Berkshire has owned P&G; stock since P&G; bought Gillette Co in 2005. Buffett had invested in Gillette since 1989. Buffett was about halfway through a 14-year stint on Gillette’s board when that company agreed to buy Duracell for $7 billion in stock in 1996. That’s more than twice what Berkshire is paying, after accounting for the cash infusion. Buffett prefers owning businesses, especially if they are easy to understand and have strong competitive advantages, to the underlying stock. Earlier this year, Buffett swapped stock of Phillips 66  for a unit that makes chemicals for pipelines, and stock of Graham Holdings Co, which once published the Washington Post, for a Miami TV station and other assets. Buffett has plenty of ammunition to buy more businesses:  Berkshire had $62.38 billion in cash as of Sept. 30. P&G; will take a noncash charge of 28 cents per share to write down goodwill and intangible assets, and adjust fiscal 2014 results to reflect Duracell as a discontinued operation. Shares of Energizer Holdings Inc, Duracell’s main rival, rose as much as 4.7 percent to a record high before easing to $128.43, up 2.6 percent. UBS household products analyst Stephen Powers said private equity investors might look for value in Energizer, given how Buffett proved “willing and eager” to buy Duracell.

373,PG,"Argentina creates new agency to track trade, slow dollar flight","BUENOS AIRES, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Argentina tightened its international trade controls on Monday by creating a new government agency to keep track of imports and exports two weeks after accusing U.S. household products giant Procter & Gamble Co  of tax fraud. Early this month Argentina said the company hid income and over-billed $138 million in imports to get money out of the country, which three years ago introduced stringent capital controls to protect its dwindling foreign reserves. The government published a decree on Monday creating the Trade Operations Tracking Unit. The new agency will “verify the price and quantity of goods and services exported and imported, along with the inflow and outflow of foreign exchange,” the decree said. International reserves held by Argentina’s central bank have fallen 7.6 percent so far this year to $28.3 billion. Cut off from the global bond market due to repeated debt defaults and interventionist policies that have slowed the economy to a standstill while inflation rages at an estimated 40 percent, Argentina relies on its reserves for financing. Cincinnati-based P&G;, the maker of Gillette razors and Tide detergent, denied wrongdoing and has entered talks with the Argentine government over the allegations of tax evasion. The company, which runs three manufacturing plants and two distribution centers in Argentina, says its Argentine operations contribute about 1 percent to its overall sales. Argentina has also accused a handful of local banks and international grains exporting companies of tax evasion charges similar to those lodged against P&G.;       (Reporting by Walter Bianchi; writing by Hugh Bronstein; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)",11172014,http://www.reuters.com/article/argentina-trade/argentina-creates-new-agency-to-track-trade-slow-dollar-flight-idUSL2N0T70PH20141117

P&G; is exploring all options for the unit, which includes a professional and a trade business.

A P&G; spokesman said the company did not comment on rumor or speculation. Goldman Sachs was not immediately available to comment. Cincinnati-based P&G; said in August it would shed 80 to 100 slow-growing product lines in order to focus on about 80 brands such as Tide laundry detergents and Pampers diapers which generate most of its profit and revenue.      In November, it announced the sale of its Duracell battery unit to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) and it has already sold the bulk of its pet food business to Mars Inc and Spectrum Brand Holdings Inc.  In the hair care segment, P&G; also owns Clairol, which it bought from Bristol-Myers Squibb for $4.95 billion in 2001, and Vidal Sassoon.

American Apparel’s board believes a bid by Irving Place Capital to buy the retailer for up to $1.40 per share is far too low, and any takeover offer should be “several multiples” higher, a source familiar with the board’s thinking said. ** Goldman Sachs Group Inc has sold its controversial metals warehousing business to Swiss private equity group Reuben Brothers, the Wall Street bank said. ** Japanese oil refiner Idemitsu Kosan Co is in talks to buy smaller rival Showa Shell Sekiyu KK for $4.2 billion in a deal that could create the nation’s second-largest player in the domestic gasoline market, a person with knowledge of the issue said. ** Procter & Gamble Co said it would sell its soap brands Camay and Zest to Unilever Plc for an undisclosed amount to focus on its faster-growing brands. ** Casino and entertainment company Caesars Entertainment Corp, whose largest operating unit plans to file for bankruptcy, said it would buy affiliate Caesars Acquisition Co  in an all-stock deal.

Rosneft, headed by Igor Sechin, a long-standing ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said on Monday that the deal was terminated because of the refusal by U.S. regulators to grant clearance. ** Buyout firm Madison Dearborn Partners LLC is in advanced talks to buy a majority stake in the infusion services business of U.S. drugstore chain operator Walgreen Co for more than $1 billion, according to two people close to the situation. ** China’s Xiaomi is raising over $1 billion from investors including Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC that would value the smartphone maker at over $45 billion, a person familiar with the deal said. ** Germany’s Gerry Weber International AG said it had agreed to buy fashion group Hallhuber from private equity firm Change Capital Partners LLP, expanding into a market catering to women in their mid-twenties and above. ** Spanish infrastructure group Ferrovial SA raised its full takeover offer for Transfield Services Ltd, valuing it at A$1.03 billion ($838.7 million), the Australian company said. ** Carlyle Group LP and Warburg Pincus LLC said they would buy credit rating agency DBRS Ltd in partnership with a consortium of Canadian investors. Reuters reported earlier this month that such a consortium was likely to buy DBRS for more than $500 million. ** Eli Lilly and Co has won approval to buy Novartis AG’s animal health unit on condition that it divest the Sentinel line of products for treating heartworm in dogs, the Federal Trade Commission said. French company Virbac SA  will buy the Sentinel product line, the FTC said. ** Oil producer Afren Plc said it had received a preliminary approach from Nigerian oil and gas explorer Seplat Petroleum Development Co Plc. ** Ailing German engineering and services company Bilfinger SE has agreed to sell most of its construction division to Swiss building giant Implenia AG as it seeks to focus on more lucrative industrial services. Bilfinger said proceeds from the sale are expected to be around 230 million euros ($280 million). ** Chile’s largest salmon producer Empresas AquaChile SA  said it was no longer pursuing a controlling stake in Invermar SA. ** Home improvement group Kingfisher Plc has agreed to sell a 70 percent stake in its B&Q; China business to Wumei Holdings Inc for 140 million pounds ($219 million), it said. ** Muenchener Rueckversicherungs Gesellschaft AG in Muenchen  has acquired a stake in a 288.6-megawatt wind farm in the United States. The acquisition, in the double-figure euro millions, is the company’s first infrastructure investment in North America. ** Italy’s Interpump Group SpA has signed a preliminary agreement to buy all of hydraulic valve maker Gruppo Walvoil in a cash and share deal. The final price is estimated at around 105 million euros with cash payments amounting to 55 percent of the total. ** CNP Assurances SA said it was selling to Barclays Bank its 50 percent stake in CNP Barclays Vida Y Pensiones (CNP BVP), for 453 million euros ($555 million) including a special dividend. The transaction is expected to close by the middle of 2015 and should result in a capital gain of about 200 million euros, CNP said. ** Czech electricity company CEZ AS has acquired a 75 percent stake in Czech firm EVC as part of a strategy shift into offering customers a broader array of services, the utility said. ** CAT Oil AG’s senior managers are leaving the Austrian fracking specialist in the wake of a takeover approach by oil industry veteran Maurice Dijols, the company said. ** Deutsche Telekom AG is in talks to sell its Internet portal T-Online and online marketer Interactive Media to publisher Axel Springer SE, German media reported at the weekend. ** Japan’s top oil refiner group JX Holdings Inc  said its wholly owned refining unit has signed a memorandum of understanding with Vietnam National Petroleum Group (Petrolimex) for exclusive talks to buy a stake in the Vietnamese oil trading firm and build a new refinery in southern Vietnam.

The lawsuit alleged the defendants - Craig Provost, John Griffin, William Tucker and Douglas Kohring - breached their contracts with Gillette by disclosing highly confidential information and trade secrets.

385,PG,Procter & Gamble optimistic over Egypt's economic recovery,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble (PG.N) expects Egypt’s economic growth could return to levels seen before the country’s 2011 popular uprising within three years, but the government needs to make life easier for investors, the company’s general manager for the region said. Mohamed Sultan, general manager and vice president, Near East, expressed confidence that stability had returned to the Arab country with its huge market of about 90 million people. “Within three years Egypt can be posting these numbers,” he said, referring to economic growth of 5-7 percent Egypt achieved before the ouster of president Hosni Mubarak, compared to 2-3 percent now. Egypt is trying to secure its fragile recovery by conveying an investor-friendly image in the run-up to an investment conference in March. Sultan declined to give any profit forecasts or details on Procter & Gamble’s investment plans in the country but he was cautiously optimistic. “I think we have been through the worst. We are able to do business. That gives you confidence. I think we are heading in the right direction,” he told Reuters in an interview. Egypt’s currency is a critical factor for foreign investors, particularly the persistence of a black market and constraints on dollar outflows. Sultan said exports allowed his company to secure funds but stressed that dealing with the foreign exchange issue would make Egypt more attractive to foreign investors. “The biggest challenges for big companies is the dollar,” said Sultan. “A number of ideas are being studied with the banks that will make access to forex easier.”  Procter & Gamble, one of the biggest non-oil sector investors in Egypt, sees growth potential in household  detergents and cleaning products as well as the diaper market. “Consumption per capita is still quite low compared to neighboring markets,” Sultan said. Procter & Gamble exports 35 percent of its products to 37 countries, he said. It believes Africa offers the most growth potential, especially Kenya. Cheaper imports from Turkey, Malaysia and China, meanwhile, are posing a challenge in Egypt, Sultan said.

Industry analysts say moms are either going upscale and choosing Pampers or going down-market with Luvs, both P&G; brands, leaving Kimberly-Clark’s mid-tier Huggies Snug & Dry line without a real identity. To compete better, Kimberly-Clark said on Friday it would cut prices and “improve” its Snug & Dry line starting this quarter, without giving details. Huggies is the core of Kimberly-Clark’s baby care products business, which generates about $7 billion in annual sales. Pampers, P&G;’s largest brand, alone has sales of over $10 billion. “The consumer is shifting downward in price and they (Kimberly-Clark) don’t have a lower-priced product,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj told Reuters. Dibadj said the company could play either end of the price spectrum: introduce a lower-priced brand or “a product that is of such high quality that people are willing to pay more for it.” P&G; and Kimberly-Clark control about 80 percent of the U.S diaper market, but the Kleenex maker is losing share, according to Euromonitor International data. Huggies’ U.S. market share dropped to 8.50 percent in 2013 from 10.2 percent in 2008. Indeed, weakening sales of Huggies and other core products in North America is expected to lead to fall in sales in 2015, Kimberly-Clark said on Friday. Its shares fell 6 percent. To claw back market shares, Kimberly-Clark plans to launch new products this year and spend more on advertising them. Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman estimates the company could cough up about $500 million for these initiatives. Kimberly-Clark spent about $3.71 billion on marketing and research in fiscal 2014. P&G; spent nearly triple, $9.73 billion, just on advertising in 2013. Lieberman said Luvs sells at a roughly 20 percent discount to Huggies Snug & Dry, with the magnitude of the discount varying with promotional activity. For example, the lowest-priced Huggies Snug & Dry 44-pack for a size 1 newborn baby costs $8.97, while P&G;’s 48-pack Luvs for the same size sells for $6.99, according to Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s website.

392,PG,"RPT-UPDATE 2-U.S. multinationals hit hard by strong dollar, to bleed further into 2015","(Repeats to fix formatting) * Strong dollar may cut up to $12 bln from Q4 U.S. revenue -FireApps * Dupont sees 2015 $0.60/share impact, Bristol-Myers $0.12-$0.14/share * Apple, P&G;, Stryker also see headwinds By Chuck Mikolajczak and Sinead Carew NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - A slew of U.S. multinational companies, from DuPont to Procter & Gamble, showed that a strong U.S. dollar hurt their earnings, and several blue-chip exporters said the situation will get worse if the greenback holds its strength. All told, the resurgent U.S. currency could shave up to $12 billion off U.S. companies’ fourth-quarter 2014 revenue alone, according to currency expert Wolfgang Koester, chief executive of FireApps, a data analytics company in Phoenix, Arizona, that examines quarterly reports for currency-related losses. The pain is hitting multiple sectors, including industrial companies such as 3M Co, technology companies like Microsoft Corp and Apple Inc, airlines such as American Airlines Group Inc, healthcare companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Pfizer Inc , and consumer firms like Procter & Gamble - which all garner a large portion of their sales from outside the United States. “This is a slow-motion crash,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. It could take a couple of quarters for currency conversion losses to show up, she said. After hitting a 6-1/2 month low in May, the dollar  has surged nearly 20 percent against a basket of major currencies, making overseas sales denominated in other currencies less valuable in dollar terms. The stronger dollar can also make U.S.-made products more expensive for consumers in other currencies and thus cut demand. The Dow Jones industrial average, composed of large and well-known companies, was hit especially hard on Tuesday as six of seven companies in the index that reported results since Monday evening declined, with only United Technologies gaining. “You have companies who don’t normally complain about (the dollar) who are starting to harp on it and it does make sense from an economic perspective that this would be a drag,” said James Liu, global market strategist at JPMorgan Funds in Chicago. “It’s really the pace that matters - not just whether it is strengthening or weakening.” The choice for multinationals is stark. They can keep customers loyal by maintaining overseas prices and take a revenue hit from a tough conversion to dollars, or raise prices and risk the loss of customers to cheaper local competitors. While many companies successfully use currency hedging to at least partly protect against foreign exchange-related losses, the speed and extent of recent fluctuations have made it more difficult to hedge. This has also hurt Wall Street analysts’ ability to estimate losses. One of the worst-hit companies appears to be chemicals giant DuPont, which derives roughly 60 percent of its revenue from overseas. DuPont said the strong dollar cut 7 cents per share off fourth-quarter earnings and will shave 60 cents off 2015 earnings per share based on recent currency rates. Procter & Gamble said foreign exchange will reduce its fiscal 2015 sales by 5 percent and its net earnings by 12 percent in what it described as its most significant currency impact ever. Bristol-Myers said it expects foreign exchange rates to cut its 2015 revenue by $800 million and 12 to 14 cents in terms of earnings per share. The impact looks even more abysmal when compared with the 1 cent per share currency impact target that multinationals set for their foreign exchange managers, according to FireApps. American icon Apple Inc is also at risk as it brings in roughly 62 percent of its revenue from overseas. It had to close its online store in Russia temporarily in December due to dramatic currency fluctuations. Currency could shave as much as $3 billion off Apple’s 2015 revenue even if its hedging strategy succeeds in halving the impact, technology analyst Shannon Cross at Cross Research in Millburn, New Jersey, said ahead of its report. Apple’s Chief Financial Officer said on Tuesday that foreign exchange is a “clear headwind” included in the company’s guidance for the year ahead. Shares in Microsoft, which gets nearly three-quarters of its revenue from overseas, finished off 9.2 percent on Tuesday after it said it was hurt by the strong dollar but gave no specifics. Medical device maker Stryker Corp said that if exchange rates stay around current levels, it expects first- quarter and 2015 sales to be hurt by 3 percent to 4 percent. Other notables names citing currency headwinds so far in the earnings season include Johnson & Johnson and IBM . Dollar strength already shaved at least $4 billion off U.S. corporate revenue in the third quarter, according to FireApps. But actual losses may be much higher as many firms citing currency impacts did not disclose the amount, it noted.

P&G;, which derives roughly two-thirds of revenue outside the United States, said the devaluation of almost every currency in the world versus the U.S. dollar hurt earnings, with the Russian ruble leading the way. “This is the most significant fiscal year currency impact we have ever incurred,” Jon Moeller, chief financial officer said in an earnings conference call. The dollar gained nearly 13 percent against a basket of major currencies in 2014, its strongest performance since 1997. For U.S.-based companies, the stronger dollar hurts the value of sales in overseas markets. Procter & Gamble said the exchange rates would reduce full-year sales by 5 percent and profit by 12 percent, or at least $1.4 billion after tax. Out of that, $1 billion would be as a result of currency devaluation in six countries - Russia, Ukraine, Venezuela, Japan, Argentina and Switzerland. Moeller said the impact from currency fluctuation will never go away fully and the company is working to further localise its supply chain and is building 20 new manufacturing plants in emerging markets. Procter & Gamble said it held market share in Latin America, Europe, India, Middle East but lost share in China and Japan. The Chinese market has become very promotional in nature, he said. The maker of Pampers diapers and Tide detergent also reported lower-than-expected revenue and profit for the second quarter ended Dec. 31. Net sales fell 4.4 percent to $20.2 billion from a year earlier. Sales rose 2 percent on an organic basis in all businesses except beauty, hair and personal care due to lower demand for its Olay creams and other products. Analysts on average had expected net sales of $20.62 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Core earnings fell to $1.06 per share, lower than the average analyst estimate of $1.13 per share. In November P&G; sold its Duracell battery business to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.

Smucker, known for its peanut butter, jam and Folgers coffee, is betting on rising pet ownership in the United States, a trend that has already attracted interest from investors and encouraged companies to sell up or go public. More U.S. households have pets than children, according to the American Pet Products Association. About 39 percent of the estimated $59 billion in pet-related spending was on food last year, according to its website. (bit.ly/1lCH45j) “With approximately two-thirds of U.S. households having at least one family pet, we will now be able to serve the mealtime and snacking needs of the whole family,” Chief Executive Richard Smucker said in a statement. Smucker said it would offer about 17.9 million shares to shareholders of Big Heart, formerly Del Monte Corp, and pay $1.3 billion in cash. Big Heart is owned by private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co LP, Vestar Capital Partners, Centerview Capital and AlpInvest Partners Inc. Together, they will own about 14 percent of Smucker after the deal. Smucker will also assume about $2.6 billion of Big Heart’s net debt, bringing the total deal value to about $5.8 billion. Smucker expects to be leveraged four times after the transaction closes by April. Shares of Smucker rose 3.2 percent to $109.35 in extended trading. After the deal, pet food will become Smucker's second-largest business after coffee, contributing an estimated $2.4 billion to sales in the year ending April 2016, the company said in a presentation on its website. (bit.ly/1zQGY3G) By acquiring San Francisco-based Big Heart, Smucker gains ownership of the 9Lives cat food brand and Kibbles ‘n Bits dog food. William Blair & Co LLC and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz advised Smucker. The deal follows several buyouts and stock listings in the pet food business. PetSmart Inc’s acquisition by a consortium of private equity firms led by BC Partners was the biggest leveraged buyout of 2014. Mars Inc bought most of Procter & Gamble Co’s pet food business last year. Freshpet Inc floated its shares in November, while larger rival Blue Buffalo Co has hired banks for an IPO.

399,PG,WRAPUP 2-U.S. trade deficit widens; weekly jobless claims up modestly,"(Adds details, analyst comments, updates markets) * Trade deficit widens to $46.6 billion in December * Imports rise 2.2 percent, exports fall 0.8 percent * Weekly jobless claims rise 11,000, less than expected By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit in December widened sharply to its highest level since 2012 as a stronger dollar appeared to suck in imports and weigh on exports, which could see the fourth-quarter economic growth estimate revised lower. The Commerce Department said on Thursday the trade deficit jumped 17.1 percent to $46.6 billion, the largest since November 2012. It was the biggest percentage increase since July 2009 and also reflected a sputtering global economy. “It is not hard to come up with reasons for the weakness in today’s report - sluggish foreign growth and a strong dollar are the obvious ones,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. Wall Street had expected the trade gap to narrow to $38 billion. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit widened to $54.7 billion from $48.7 billion in November. December’s shortfall was wider than the government had assumed when it reported last week that gross domestic product had expanded at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. Trade was estimated to have subtracted 1.02 percentage point from GDP growth. Economists said it now appeared the drag on growth was bigger and they expect the government to lower the fourth-quarter growth estimate by as much as four-tenths of a percentage point when it publishes revisions later this month. On an inflation-adjusted trade-weighted basis, the dollar appreciated 5.3 percent last year. While trade is on the back foot, the labor market is weathering the strong dollar and the global slowdown. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 278,000 for the week ended Jan. 31, the Labor Department said in a separate report. The increase, which was less than economists’ expectations for a rise to 290,000, left intact the bulk of the prior week’s huge decline, which had taken claims to their lowest level since April 2000. U.S. stocks were trading higher, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell. January’s employment report to be released on Friday will likely show that nonfarm payrolls increased 234,000, according to a Reuters survey of economists, which would be the longest stretch of job gains above 200,000 since 1994. A firming labor market, together with lower gasoline prices, is seen bolstering consumer spending, which is expected to drive growth in early 2015. “We still believe the U.S. can remain an oasis of prosperity in the world even if international developments are starting to intrude a little on our buoyant forecasts for 2015,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. In a sign of the consumer-driven strengthening in domestic demand, imports rose 2.2 percent to $241.4 billion in December. The increase was in part due to a jump in petroleum imports, which hit their highest level since May 2013. The higher petroleum imports probably found their way into wholesale inventories and could prove temporary. “We suspect ... storage plays by domestic oil market participants, with a large number of oil investors racing to buy crude at lower prices and storing it amid contango plays,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York. Imports of non-petroleum products surged to a record high, also reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar. But with the dollar’s rise, exports slipped 0.8 percent to $194.9 billion in December, an eight-month low. A range of companies, including Procter & Gamble Co, the world’s largest household products maker, and Microsoft Corp  have warned that the dollar was hurting profits. Exports have been hurt by a labor dispute at U.S. West Coast ports, which has been cited by some manufacturers as causing delays in the movement of goods. Exports to Canada and Mexico - the main U.S. trading partners - fell in December. In contrast, exports to Japan, China and the European Union rose in December. The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit fell 5.5 percent to $28.3 billion.

400,PG,"UPDATE 3-Venezuela announces new currency system, large devaluation seen","(Adds reaction, details) By Corina Pons and Brian Ellsworth CARACAS, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Venezuela on Tuesday launched a new foreign exchange platform that will likely devalue the bolivar heavily in efforts to bolster state coffers amid tumbling oil revenue, but risk a spike in already soaring inflation. The change amounts to an easing of 12-year-old currency controls and marks a small step toward market economics as the state-led model created by late socialist leader Hugo Chavez struggles with shortages, swelling grocery lines and recession. However, the changes by Nicolas Maduro’s government do not eliminate the unwieldy three-tiered exchange structure seen by investors as the country’s principal stumbling block to economic growth. The change will likely lead to billions of dollars in write-downs by foreign corporations with exposure to Venezuela including General Motors Co, household goods maker Procter & Gamble Co and drugmaker Merck & Co Inc. The new platform, called Marginal Currency System or Simadi, is the third system in a three-tier exchange control mechanism and will allow for legal trading of foreign currency based on supply and demand, said Finance Minister Rodolfo Marco. “This third mechanism is open, free, in which bidders and buyers exchange offers,” Marco said during a press conference with Central Bank President Nelson Merentes. The currency controls have been providing U.S. dollars at three different rates: 6.3 bolivars for food and medicine, and two complementary rates of around 12 bolivars and 52 bolivars for other goods through systems known as Sicad I and Sicad II. But dollars fetch nearly 190 bolivars on the black market, according to widely referenced website dolartoday.com. Marco and Merentes did not offer details on what the open rate would be when the market kicks off in coming days. Merentes said the new platform would help lower the parallel rate. Brokerage sources consulted by Reuters say the rate could begin at around 120 bolivars, substantially lower then the black market but still more than double the lowest existing rate. A representative of the country’s primary business organization, Fedecamaras, said via telephone that the group was still studying the measure and did not have immediate comment on how the country’s businesses would be affected. Opposition critics slammed the announcement as an insufficient measure that will do little to address the decaying economy, which one former government minister recently described as becoming the “laughing-stock” of the region. “If devaluation were the solution, we would be Switzerland!” wrote opposition-leaning economist Miguel Angel Santos via Twitter, noting repeated devaluations during the 16 years of rule by the late Chavez and Maduro. The tumbling price of oil, which provides nearly all of Venezuela’s hard currency, has left the 12-year-old exchange controls struggling to provide dollars to ensure steady supplies of such as detergent and milk that are increasingly going missing. Venezuela had the worst economic performance in Latin America last year with 2.8 percent GDP contraction and officially-estimated 64 percent inflation. Dismay over the state of the economy, and particularly of product shortages, has pushed Maduro’s approval rating down to 22 percent, according to local pollster Datanalisis. A further spike in inflation due to the higher cost of imports could spur voter indignation and leave the ruling Socialist Party unable to maintain its majority in legislative elections to be held later this year. Both Marco and Merentes, however, denied there would be an inflationary impact. The Sicad I auction system will continue to hold periodic auctions for specific sectors of the economy and will for the moment continue providing dollars at the rate of 12, Marco said, adding that rate would change over time. The new Simadi market will replace the Sicad II system. Investors generally interpret devaluations positively because they leave the government with more hard currency available to service debt. Venezuelan bonds, which have been trading at distressed levels on fears of a possible default, were up across the board on Tuesday, with yields on several dropping to one-month lows. The Global 2026 bond was up 2.750 points in price to yield 26.841 percent while the Global 2022  rose 3.180 points to yield 31.717 percent. Equities investors face billions of dollars in write-downs by U.S. corporations with exposure to Venezuela, as many have been unable to repatriate bolivars back into dollars due to delays in the currency controls. At least 40 major U.S. companies together carry at least $11 billion of bolivar assets on their books, concentrated among 10 companies that have disclosed about $7.3 billion in assets linked to the country’s currency system. Others foreign companies with notable exposure to Venezuela include Spain’s Telefonica and Germany drugmaker Bayer . Some companies have already taken charges on their Venezuela exposure, including Kimberly Clark, Ford and Schlumberger. General Motors last week said in its annual report that instability in Venezuela could lead to a $900 million hit to earnings. The Coca-Cola Co said during a conference call on Tuesday that it expects Venezuela pricing provisions will continue to negatively impact net revenue.

401,PG,Venezuela to announce new forex system; devaluation expected,"CARACAS, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Venezuela on Tuesday will unveil a new foreign exchange system that is likely to ease the country’s three-tiered currency controls but would also mean a hefty devaluation of the bolivar currency. Finance Minister Rodolfo Marco and Central Bank President Nelson Merentes were to hold a news conference at 11 a.m. local time (1030 EST/1530 GMT) on a “new exchange scheme,” the government said. The currency controls have been providing dollars at three different rates: 6.3 bolivars for food and medicine, and two complementary rates of around 12 bolivars and 52 bolivars for other goods through systems known as Sicad I and Sicad II. On the black market, the dollar is selling for nearly 190 bolivars, according to widely referenced website dolartoday.com. President Nicolas Maduro in January said the government would keep the preferential rate of 6.3 bolivars, maintain Sicad I at a yet-to-be-announced rate, and replace Sicad II with a new supply-and-demand driven platform. Brokerage operators who have been discussing the new system with officials told Reuters that the idea was to allow the bolivar to trade on that platform at a rate nearer the black market, at least double the current weakest level of 52. The operators said authorities were projecting the black market price could come down to between 120 and 140 bolivars once the third system opens. The Central Bank and state oil company PDVSA would be allowed to sell foreign currency via this mechanism, the sources said, with a projected daily offer of between $30 million and $45 million. The Central Bank would retain a power of veto over all operations, they added. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the issue. Venezuela had the worst economic performance in Latin America last year with 2.8 percent GDP contraction and officially-estimated 64 percent inflation. The 12-year-old exchange controls have steadily reduced dollar disbursals amid declining oil prices, spurring shortages of products such as detergent and milk as companies have been unable to import machinery and raw materials. The new exchange rate is likely to affect U.S. corporate giants with exposure to Venezuela because the government has not allowed them to repatriate revenue from operations. At least 40 major U.S. companies, including General Motors Co, household goods maker Procter & Gamble Co and drugmaker Merck & Co Inc, together carry at least $11 billion of bolivar assets on their books.

The OPEC nation on Tuesday unveiled a new free-floating currency platform called Simadi, the third system in a three-tier exchange control mechanism meant to bolster state coffers.

Siobhan Morden, a veteran emerging market debt strategist and head of Latin America strategy at Jeffries in New York believes the government needs to fill a $14 billion hole in its balance sheet in order to meet its obligations. “Maybe they can do something that is extremely creative that enables them to get through this year. But as it stands right now, with all the resources I am looking at, they are underfunded,” said Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America strategy at Jefferies in New York. If President Nicolas Maduro can make it through this year, that funding gap increases to roughly $26 billion in 2016, Morden said. “Then they are absolutely, completely underfunded for 2016. But that is assuming they make it through this year. I would say there is still a high probability of default this year,” she said. Critics pointed out that the changes to the 12-year-old currency control system did not remove two heavily over valued exchange rates, which will limit the government’s ability to save hard currency amid a drastic fall in oil revenues. “The persistence of large distortions in the FX market will make it more difficult for the government to make necessary savings in the new scenario of lower oil prices,” wrote Alejandro Grisanti of Barclays. “In such conditions, scarcity and inflation problems could continue to deepen.” Benchmark Venezuelan government debt fell sharply because the new plan underwhelmed the the market. Simadi was seen as marginal tinkering at best, even if it was a step in the right direction toward reform. Venezuela’s Global 2027 bond fell 3.49 points in price to bid 40.005, driving the yield up to 25.12 percent. . An investor wanting to insure a $10 million portfolio of Venezuelan sovereign bonds for five years would need to spend $6.52 million upfront versus $6.32 million on Tuesday, according to data provider Markit. State-owned oil company PDVSA’s bonds declined as well. It’s benchmark 2024 bond dropped 1.36 points in price to bid 32.64, with yield up to nearly 25 percent. A plunge in oil prices has left Venezuela’s state-led model created by late socialist leader Hugo Chavez struggling with shortages, swelling grocery lines and recession. The country’s dollar-denominated bonds are now trading at distressed levels and on average their yields pay 27 percentage points more than similar U.S. Treasury bills due to concerns of a possible default. Maduro insists the country will meet all foreign debt commitments without cutting social spending plans or scrapping the currency control system. CORPORATE WRITE-DOWNS Bonds had jumped on Tuesday in expectation that the new system would imply a large devaluation, which is generally viewed positively by bondholders because it frees up more hard currency for debt service. Officials did not say what the exchange rate would be on the new system, insisting it would be determined by supply and demand once the market kicks off in the coming days. Business leaders in Venezuela have given little detailed reaction to the change, though some said the free-floating mechanism was a welcome, albeit limited, move. “The government is recognizing that supply and demand must set prices,” said Jorge Roig, head of the main business group Fedecamaras, in reference to the new system. “A bit of liberalism isn’t a bad thing.” The three-tiered system will now comprise the preferential rate of 6.3 bolivars per dollar for food and medicine, a complementary rate of 12 bolivars for other goods through a system called Sicad, and the floating rate via Simadi. Local consultancy Ecoanalitica estimated the new rate would start between 130 and 140 bolivars. The group added that the weighted average exchange rate for 2015 would be 46.6 bolivars per dollar compared with 20.3 bolivars in 2014, which would imply a devaluation of 56 percent. That could force another round of hefty write-downs by foreign companies with exposure to Venezuela including General Motors Co, household goods maker Procter & Gamble Co  and Spanish telecom giant Telefonica.

403,PG,"UPDATE 4-Venezuela creates new 'free' currency system, devaluation seen","(Adds Maduro, analysis, details) By Corina Pons and Brian Ellsworth CARACAS, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Venezuela launched a “free” foreign exchange platform on Tuesday that will likely devalue the bolivar in efforts to bolster state coffers amid tumbling oil revenue, although it risks causing a spike in already soaring inflation. The change amounts to an easing of 12-year-old currency controls and marks a small step toward a market economy as the state-led model created by late socialist leader Hugo Chavez struggles with shortages, swelling grocery lines and recession. However, the changes by President Nicolas Maduro’s government do not eliminate the unwieldy three-tiered exchange structure seen by investors as the country’s principal stumbling block to economic growth. The change could lead to billions of dollars in write-downs by foreign corporations with exposure to Venezuela including General Motors Co, household goods maker Procter & Gamble Co and drugmaker Merck & Co Inc. The new platform, called Marginal Currency System or Simadi, is the third system in a three-tier exchange control mechanism and will allow for legal trading of foreign currency based on supply and demand, said Finance Minister Rodolfo Marco. “This third mechanism is open, free, in which bidders and buyers exchange offers,” Marco said during a press conference with Central Bank President Nelson Merentes. The currency controls have been providing U.S. dollars at three different rates: 6.3 bolivars for food and medicine, and two complementary rates of around 12 bolivars and 52 bolivars for other goods through systems known as Sicad I and Sicad II. But dollars fetch nearly 190 bolivars on the black market, according to widely referenced website dolartoday.com. Marco and Merentes did not say what the open rate would be when the market kicks off in coming days. They predicted the new platform would help lower the parallel rate. Brokerage sources consulted by Reuters say the rate could begin around 120 bolivars, substantially lower than on the black market but still more than double the lowest existing rate. Local consultancy Ecoanalitica estimated a starting price of 130-140 bolivars, an average price of 115 throughout 2015, and a total offer of $7.5 billion via that system in the year. The dollars, Econalitica said, would come from state oil company PDVSA, other oil companies operating in Venezuela, off-budget sate funds such as Fonden, and via Venezuelan bonds. Taking into account the three different tiers, “that would make the average 2015 exchange rate 46.6 bolivars per dollar, a devaluation of 56.5 percent compared to 2014,” it said. Opposition critics slammed the announcement as an insufficient measure that will do little to address the decaying economy, which one former government minister recently described as becoming the “laughing-stock” of the region. “If devaluation were the solution, we would be Switzerland!” wrote opposition-leaning economist Miguel Angel Santos via Twitter, noting repeated devaluations during the 16 years of rule by the late Chavez and Maduro. The tumbling price of oil, which provides nearly all of Venezuela’s hard currency, has left the 12-year-old exchange controls struggling to provide dollars to ensure steady supplies of products such as detergent and milk that are increasingly scarce around Venezuela. Maduro, speaking late on Tuesday, said Venezuela’s revenues had fallen 60 percent due to the oil price decline, and the country was ready for another two years of “low or very low” prices. However, all social welfare projects and foreign debt commitments, starting with the 1 billion euro Global 2015 issue  coming due on March 16, would be honored, his economic officials said. Venezuela had the worst economic performance in Latin America last year, with 2.8 percent GDP contraction and officially-estimated 64 percent inflation. Dismay over the state of the economy, and particularly of product shortages, has pushed Maduro’s approval rating down to 22 percent, according to local pollster Datanalisis. “Despite the fanfare that is likely to accompany the apparent shift towards a market-based foreign exchange system, we doubt that it will solve Venezuela’s deep economic problems,” Capital Economics said in a note on Tuesday’s changes. A further spike in inflation, due to the higher cost of imports for businesses, could spur voter indignation and leave the ruling Socialist Party unable to maintain its majority in legislative elections to be held later this year. Both Marco and Merentes, however, denied there would be an inflationary impact. They said 70 percent of the economy’s needs would be covered by dollars sold at the 6.3 rate. The Sicad I auction system will continue to hold periodic auctions for specific sectors of the economy and will for the moment continue providing dollars at the rate of 12, Marco said, adding that rate would change over time. The new Simadi market will replace the Sicad II system. Investors generally interpret devaluations positively because they leave the government with more hard currency available to service debt. Venezuelan bonds, which have been trading at distressed levels on fears of a possible default, were up across the board on Tuesday, with yields on several dropping to one-month lows. The Global 2026 bond was up 2.750 points in price to yield 26.841 percent while the Global 2022  rose 3.180 points to yield 31.717 percent. Equities investors face billions of dollars in write-downs by U.S. corporations with exposure to Venezuela, as many have been unable to repatriate bolivars back into dollars due to delays in the currency controls. At least 40 major U.S. companies together carry at least $11 billion of bolivar assets on their books, concentrated among 10 companies that have disclosed about $7.3 billion in assets linked to the country’s currency system. Other foreign companies with notable exposure to Venezuela include Spain’s Telefonica and German drugmaker Bayer . Some companies have already taken charges on their Venezuela exposure, including Kimberly Clark, Ford and Schlumberger. General Motors last week said in its annual report that instability in Venezuela could lead to a $900 million hit to earnings.

408,PG,Fitch: Block P&G; Beauty Divestment Unlikely to Interest Rivals,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: P&G; Beauty Division Divestment â€“ Block Sale to  Investment-Grade Peer Unlikely here MILAN/LONDON, April 09 (Fitch) Procter & Gamble's reported plan to divest a  large chunk of its USD20bn beauty division is unlikely to attract interest from  major competitors such as L'Oreal, Henkel, Unilever, Colgate and Kimberly Clark  if P&G; wants to offload the business in a single sale, Fitch Ratings says in a  new report. But rivals would probably be interested in buying individual brands. According to media reports, P&G; intends to retain several brands, such as  Pantene, that have leading shares and positive marketing momentum, and may  divest the remaining assets in one lot via an IPO or sale. We estimate that the  remaining assets lined up for divestment generate about USD8bn in revenues, and  at a conservative 15x EBITDA multiple could cost a buyer USD13bn-15bn.  This would be a hefty price for major competitors and the USD8bn in revenues  would be transformative for all but Unilever, which has roughly USD52bn total  revenues (including food). The assets probably would not be earnings accretive  as margins are lower than those of potential buyers, and therefore would be more  likely to negatively affect the would-be buyer's existing ratings. We therefore  do not think any major consumer industry companies have the capacity or  willingness to engage in an acquisition of this magnitude, particularly if it is  non-accretive. We therefore believe that if the assets were divested as a single block, an IPO  or a sale to a non-strategic buyer would be more likely. Unrated Coty Inc. could  also be a potential buyer as it is focussed on growth and has previously been  able to offer USD10.7bn for Avon Products.  We believe major rated consumer companies would be more interested in selective  acquisition of P&G; brands, and several could remain near current ratings if they  made acquisitions with a price tag of around USD5bn. But even if buyers were  able to pick and choose a group of brands the price is likely to be high, and  require a meaningful level of debt financing and future cash draws for brand  support and integration.

410,PG,"Mining, utilities sink U.S. industrial production","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industrial output posted its biggest drop in more than 2-1/2 years in March in part as oil and gas well drilling plummeted, highlighting the negative impact of lower crude prices and a strong dollar on the economy. The dour report from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday was the latest sign that growth slowed sharply in the first quarter and suggested the U.S. central bank could delay raising interest rates until later this year.  Snowy winter weighed on activity early in 2015. Labor disruptions at normally busy West Coast ports, as well as the dollar and softer global demand have been a constraint. “This provides some confirmation on the disappointing growth performance in the first quarter. The absence of a lift in the other forward-looking indicators suggests that the U.S. economic recovery is struggling to regain any traction,” said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.  Industrial production fell 0.6 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in February, the Fed said. March’s decline was the largest since August 2012 and was worse than economists’ expectations for only a 0.3 percent drop. A 17.7 percent plunge in oil and gas well drilling pulled mining production down 0.7 percent in March, marking the third straight month of declines in mining output.  Crude oil has lost more than half of its value since last June, resulting in a sharp drop in well drilling activity. Companies in the oil field are also either postponing or cutting back on capital expenditure projects. Separately, the Fed in its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide said investment in oil and gas drilling had declined and related layoffs were reported by “multiple” regions.  Caterpillar Inc early this year cut its 2015 profit outlook and warned lower oil prices would hurt its energy equipment business. Last month, utilities production tumbled 5.9 percent, also weighing on industrial production. “We do not see the emerging picture as supporting the hand of those who have been arguing for an earlier Fed rate hike,” said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York. Most economists have pushed back their expectations for the first rate hike to either September or October from June. Others believe monetary policy will only be tightened in 2016. The Fed has kept interest rates near zero since December 2008.  Data including for retail sales, housing starts, inventories, trade and manufacturing suggest the economy grew at a sub-1.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter after a 2.2 percent pace in the October-December quarter. U.S. Treasury prices rose as the data supported bets the Fed was likely to wait longer to raise rates. Stocks rose while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies. For the first quarter, industrial production declined at an annual rate of 1.0 percent, the first quarterly decrease since the second quarter of 2009. Oil and gas well drilling and servicing, which tumbled at a 69.8 percent rate, accounted for the bulk of the drop in industrial output in the first quarter.  While manufacturing output ticked up 0.1 percent in March, the first gain since last November, it fell at a 1.2 percent rate in the first quarter, the first decline since the second quarter of 2009.  The soft trend could persist for a while. In a separate report, the New York Fed said its Empire State general business conditions index fell to -1.19 in April from March’s 6.90. This was the first negative read for the index since December. The weakness in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been attributed to the buoyant dollar, bad weather and supply chain disruptions from the ports dispute.  Softer growth in Europe and Asia, especially China where the economy expanded at its slowest pace in six years in the first quarter, has also been a drag. The dollar has gained 13 percent against the United States’ main trading partners since last June, which economists say is equivalent to a 0.5 percentage point interest rate hike. “The dollar’s strength may be taking some of the oomph out of factory production, which had been on a tear until December last year,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at  MUFG Union Bank in New York. “Time will tell whether this is real weakness or simply a bump on the road to prosperity. Our guess remains the economy comes back strong later on this spring.” Companies like Microsoft Corp and Procter & Gamble Co, the world’s largest household products maker, and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson have warned  the dollar will hit sales and profits this year.

While DuPont is expected to report lower first-quarter results, Travelers Companies Inc’s first-quarter results are expected to be in line with estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will keep an eye out for details on Verizon’s upcoming mobile video service and capital expenditure range and will look for updates on AT&T;’s proposed $48.5 billion deal to buy DirectTV, which is under regulatory review. Boeing faces fears of an aircraft downturn after it booked record orders in 2014, while Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s new CEO, is charged with reviving the company’s falling sales and managing negative PR around the healthiness of its food. Investors will be watching the impact of the strong dollar on 3M’s first-quarter results and Microsoft is expected to report sharply lower profit for its third quarter as sales of personal computers remain soggy. Search engine giant Google Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts’ estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Google, which has been officially charged of cheating consumers and competitors by the European Union, is also being investigated for its Android mobile operating system. Analysts say the latter could prove a bigger threat to Google’s future profitability. Analysts expect foreign exchange to negatively impact revenues in the first quarter even as paid click growth is poised to decelerate again. Facebook Inc is expected to post a first-quarter profit above Wall Street’s expectations on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data.

Many investors also expect that video ads will provide the company’s next leg of growth. Facebook has also been stepping up efforts to expand products like messaging service WhatsApp and photo-sharing service Instagram. Investors will be looking out for the company’s outlook for the remainder of 2015. On Thursday, the e-commerce company Amazon.com Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue largely in line with analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. However, analysts are expecting margins to improve as the company gets a grip on a slew of investments on everything from Hollywood-style television productions to cloud computing and consumer devices. On Tuesday, Yahoo Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts’ estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, as its overall share of U.S. desktop searches declines.

Analysts are expecting 96 cents per share, up sharply from a year before. On Wednesday, chipmaker Qualcomm Inc is likely to report second-quarter revenue and profit broadly in line with analysts’ average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Qualcomm lowered its outlook for fiscal 2015 in January, saying it did not expect its newest Snapdragon mobile chip to be used in a major customer’s flagship smartphone. Samsung opted for its own mobile processor and modem chip in the Galaxy S6 instead of equivalents from Qualcomm. The chipmaker had also warned that “challenges” with another of its chips had hurt its competitiveness in China. Qualcomm recently came under pressure from hedge fund Jana Partners to spin off its chip business from its patent-licensing business. Credit Suisse reports earnings for the first three months of 2015 on Tuesday. Meanwhile, on Friday the Swiss bank will ask shareholders to sign off in a symbolic vote on executive pay for 2014, when Credit Suisse became the largest bank in decades to plead guilty to a U.S. criminal charge and will pay more than $2.5 billion in penalties for helping Americans evade taxes. Investors will focus on existing home sales on Wednesday, which is expected to have increased 3.0 percent to an annual rate of 5.05 million units. Also, data for new home sales is expected to be released on Thursday. On Friday, the U.S. Commerce Department releases data for durable goods. Starbucks Corp reports its second-quarter results on Thursday. Starbucks is one of the restaurant industry’s top performers, but investors and analysts worry that its streak of red-hot growth is coming to an end. The company has a variety of plans in place to boost sales (adding booze, smoothies, more lunch and dinner options, improving and expanding tea selections and testing delivery) and investors will be looking for proof that those are working. On Tuesday, Yum Brands Inc will report its first-quarter results. Yum’s China business remains in the spotlight as it fights to recover from the latest food scandal in its biggest market. Analysts say the company is suffering from “brand fatigue” in China, where competition is mounting and its image has been hurt by food scares that have raised doubts over its supply chain. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc is slated to announce results for the first quarter on Tuesday. Chipotle is still having problems finding pork suppliers to replace the one it suspended for running afoul of its animal welfare rules. The company says customers have simply switched to other meats and that it isn’t losing sales - but investors will be on alert for any signs of a slowdown. Drugmaker Biogen Inc is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Friday, driven by strong sales of its top-selling oral MS drug, Tecfidera, which has seen burgeoning sales since its launch in 2013. Biogen, which leads the United States multiple sclerosis market with five drugs for the condition, recently reported promising data for its Alzheimer’s drug. Investors will also be looking for commentary on Tecfider’s growth expectations, and potential for competition, as well as the longer-acting MS injectable Plegridy. AbbVie Inc, whose planned $21 billion acquisition of Pharmacyclics Inc is meant to lessen the company’s dependence on its blockbuster Humira arthritis drug, is expected to report sharply higher earnings and sales for the first quarter on Thursday, fueled by Humira’s continuing growth and sales of the company’s recently approved Viekira Pak treatment for hepatitis C. Investors will be keen for details on sales prospects for Viekira Pak, given steep price discounts AbbVie has given to compete with Gilead Science Inc’s potent treatments for the liver disease. Eli Lilly and Co is expected to report higher first-quarter earnings on Thursday as the Indianapolis drugmaker begins to recover from patent expirations that slashed demand for its biggest products. The company is well positioned to deliver a promised return to profit growth this year, helped by new treatments for cancer and diabetes and growing sales of its animal health brands. Abbott Laboratories will report its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Recovering sales of Abbott Laboratories’ infant formulas, following costly recalls in Asia, and improving performance of the company’s branded generic medicines, are expected to drive quarterly earnings growth despite the negative impact of the stronger dollar. Ebay Inc is expected to report results for the first quarter largely in line with Wall Street expectations on Wednesday. The company has seen strong growth in payments business as well as its non-auction e-commerce business. Analysts expect that the company will continue to benefit from the rise in demand for mobile devices, as consumers increasingly use their smart phones and tablets to shop online. Investors will look for details on the company’s plans for the spinoff of PayPal scheduled for the second half of 2015. On Thursday, Dow Chemical Co is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit due to a stronger dollar and a slowdown in its agricultural business. The company last month said it would offload a bulk of its low-margin bleach and vinyl-related business to Olin in a $5 billion. Investors will be looking for further comments on the company’s cost-saving plans. Johnson Controls Inc, the auto parts supplier and maker of climate control systems for buildings, is expected to report higher second-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by higher sales in its seating and interiors business as auto sales and production rose in the first quarter. The company’s buildings efficiency business, which provides air conditioning equipment and building management services, is also expected to report higher revenue as U.S. office vacancy rate declined to its lowest level since the third quarter to 2009. Investors will be looking for comments on Johnson Controls’ business focus and outlook following the sale of its workplace solutions business to CBRE Group. Pentagon’s No. 1 arms supplier, Lockheed Martin Corp, reports first-quarter results on Tuesday. Lockheed Martin has been focusing on increasing sales to commercial customers in United States as well as international governments to make up for pressures from tight U.S. defense spending. Lockheed gets 17 percent of its revenue from international markets and 1 percent from U.S. commercial customers. Investors will be looking to see if Lockheed still expects U.S. military spending to meaningfully pick up this year. Weapons maker Raytheon Co has increased exposure to international markets, which account for about 27 percent of its total sales, as U.S. defense spending remains tight. The maker of the Tomahawk missile and the Patriot missile defense system forecast disappointing 2015 revenue in January as domestic orders remained weak. When the company will report its first-quarter results on Thursday, investors will be looking for an update on a $2 billion order for the Patriot missile defense system that Raytheon expected to win in the first quarter. On Tuesday, Omnicom Group Inc, the No. 1 U.S. advertising company, is expected to report first-quarter results largely in-line with analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Omnicom had warned that a strong dollar would hit revenue this year. Omnicom, whose clients include Apple, McDonald’s and Adidas, gets a little less than half of its revenue from outside the United States. On Friday, Interpublic Group of Companies Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts’ average estimate according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company’s previous quarter was helped by higher ad spending by businesses in the United States. On Tuesday, chipmaker Broadcom Corp is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts’ estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts expect the company’s connectivity business to sequentially decline as it comes off a strong Apple-driven fourth quarter. Analysts will be looking for the company to provide outlook for the quarter ending June. On Wednesday, data storage company EMC Corp is expected to report first-quarter profit and revenue below analysts’ estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company had in January forecast a lower-than-expected profit for 2015 and said it would cut jobs. The company, which earns nearly half of its revenue from international markets, is expected to be hurt by a strong dollar. Analysts say enterprise storage demand has been mixed in quarter which may hurt EMC. Virtualization software maker VMware Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts’ estimate on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, hurt by a stronger dollar. More than 48 percent of VMware’s revenue comes from outside the United States. Analysts at Wells Fargo estimate a negative impact of 3-4 percent from foreign currency on license revenue growth. Programmable chip maker Xilinx Inc will report fourth-quarter results after markets close on Wednesday. The company, which dominates the programmable chip market along with Altera Corp, is expected to report profit and revenue that are largely in line with analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will look for updates on sales to the broadcast, consumer and automotive end market and sales to communications and data center customers. PulteGroup Inc’s first-quarter results are expected to be released on Thursday. Coming on the heels of larger peer D.R. Horton’s second-quarter results on Wednesday, PulteGroup’s results are expected to provide further evidence of a strong spring selling season this year, suggesting that a slowdown in housing starts in the first three months did not point to underlying weakness in the U.S. housing market. Steelmaker Nucor Corp will report first-quarter results on Thursday. Nucor has been struggling with lower selling prices due to high levels of imports. Declining oil prices have also led to excess inventory in Nucor’s pipe and tube business. Analysts will be looking for comments on inventory, steel demand and overcapacity in its steel mills business. On Thursday, Patterson-UTI Energy Inc, the second-largest land driller in North America, is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit as weak oil prices weigh on drilling activity. Patterson, which halved its rig construction program for this year, had warned that 2015 would be “challenging,” having received indications that customers could terminate a number of longer-term contracts early. Investors will be looking for updates on further cost saving measures and commentary on contracts and dayrates for its 16 new high-tech Apex rigs, which analysts believe could help the driller boost cash margins this year. Contract driller Nabors Industries Ltd, which is merging with C&J; Energy, is expected to report on Tuesday a lower profit in the first quarter as drilling activity continues to be hurt by the fall in oil prices. The company has already warned of weak activity and pricing pressure in its international operations. Investors will be looking for updates on any job cuts and the company’s plans to idle rigs in an oversupplied market. On Tuesday, coal miner Arch Coal Inc is expected to report a ninth straight quarterly loss and on Thursday, coal miner Peabody Energy Corp is expected to report a wider first-quarter loss due to continued weakness in coal prices. Kimberly-Clark Corp, the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, is expected to report better-than-expected first-quarter sales, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, helped by growing demand in emerging markets such as Brazil, China and South Africa. However, higher input costs and a stronger dollar could have hurt profit. The company said in February it would transfer pension obligations to two insurers to reduce risk and will take a charge in the second quarter. It had also warned of an 8-9 percent drop in 2015 sales hurt by the dollar and weak demand for core products such as Huggies diapers. Investors will be looking for any updates on forecast on Tuesday. Hershey Co, the maker of Hershey’s Kisses and Reese’s peanut butter cups, has been struggling with high cocoa and dairy costs and intense competition from rivals such as Mondelez and Mars. To tackle growing competition, the company has been pouring money in advertisements and promotions, but this is expected to hurt its full-year earnings per share by 2 percentage points. It has also tried to diversify and add a new stream of revenue by acquiring jerky maker Krave Pure Foods Inc in January, marking its first foray into meat snacks. When the company will report its first-quarter profit on Thursday, investors will be looking out for comments on whether the company will make more acquisitions in the meat and bakery snacks category, which are becoming more popular than candy, and the effect of the strong dollar on its outlook. Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc will report its first-quarter results on Thursday. Investors will be looking at how much Boston’s record snowfall hurt results at Dunkin Brands, whose Dunkin’ Donuts shops are concentrated in the U.S. northeast. Experts say the impact could be meaningful. Under Armour Inc, a sports apparel and footwear maker, is expected to report profit and sales for the first quarter in line with analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts expect Under Armour to continue its 19-quarter streak of reporting more than 20 percent growth in revenue, helped by expanded offerings in sport and outdoor clothing, strong demand for its Speedform Apollo running shoes, new launches in basketball footwear and sponsorship deals. The company is also expected to benefit from investments in its fast-growing digital platform and from the acquisitions of fitness tracking apps Endomondo and MyFitnessPal. When the company will report on Tuesday, investors will look for an update to the full-year forecast and color on the performance of new launches in footwear. Hanesbrands Inc, the innerwear and apparel maker is expected to report first-quarter profit and sales above analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts are projecting first-quarter sales growth of more than 15 percent as the company benefits from higher sales of sport and gym clothing at department stores, and the acquisition of DBApparel and Maidenform Brands. When the company reports on Thursday, investors will look for an update to the full-year forecast and more color on the company’s recent acquisition of college logo clothing maker Knights Apparel. Ingersoll-Rand Plc, the maker of Trane air conditioners and Thermo King refrigeration units, is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by growth in global industrial and construction markets. Investors will be looking for the impact of a strong dollar on the company’s industrial business, which has a higher proportion of revenue coming from outside the United States. Investors will also be looking for an update on how much the weakness in oil prices has hurt the company’s newly acquired centrifugal compression business. Xerox Corp, which has been shifting its focus to IT services from making printers and copiers, is expected to report first-quarter revenue that is slightly below analysts’ estimate on Friday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Xerox had cut its profit forecast for 2015 for the second time after reporting its sixth-consecutive drop in revenue last quarter. In December, the company agreed to sell its IT outsourcing arm to Atos. Teck Resources Ltd, Canada’s largest diversified miner, is expected to report on Tuesday a lower profit in the first quarter as prices for both copper and steel-making coal remain depressed amid a fall in demand. The company in March denied media reports that it was in talks to merge with Chilean copper producer Antofagasta. Teck CEO also refuted speculations of a possible merger with HudBay Minerals or an acquisition of Zaldivar, a copper mine owned by Barrick Gold. Teck said in February it might reduce its dividend in July if the industry-wide production cuts fail to boost coal prices. Investors will be interested in any comments of a possible merger or acquisition and demand for steel-making coal. Car seat maker Lear Corp is expected to report higher first-quarter profit on Friday helped by strong demand in North America and a rise in vehicle production. Some analysts expect Lear to benefit from cheaper commodity prices and report higher margins. Investors will look for Lear’s comments on Mercato Capital seeking a split of the auto parts suppliers businesses. Investment bank and asset manager Lazard Ltd reports first-quarter earnings on Thursday. Lazard is expected to benefit from a jump in corporate dealmaking, which should have boosted its M&A; advisory business. Globally, deals worth $811.8 billion were announced in the first quarter, up 21 percent, compared to a year earlier. Among them, Lazard advised on the merger of Heinz-Kraft and the sale of Serbia’s state-operated Telekom Srbija. However, analysts expect lower-than-anticipated deal completions to weigh on the company’s quarterly revenue. Lazard has been focusing more on asset management to be less reliant on financial advisory fees. AutoNation Inc, the largest U.S. car dealer chain, reports first-quarter results on Wednesday. Investors will be watching margins on new car sales, any potential expansion moves and for any concerns about U.S. consumer spending going forward. On Thursday, Qlik Technologies Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue above analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, on higher demand for its data analytics software. The company had forecast full-year adjusted profit below analysts’ average estimate and its revenue forecast was also largely below Wall Street estimates. Touchscreen chipmaker Synaptics Inc is expected to report third-quarter profit below analysts’ estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, on weak demand from smartphone makers. Analysts have said that certain Samsung designs that have come out recently are not using Synaptics touch IC products. Online music streaming service provider Pandora Media Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue above analysts’ average estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company is expected to benefit from stronger listening hours and its gradual move into automobiles, where more than half of all radio listening occurs in the U.S. Investors will look for updates on user and local ad growth. On Wednesday, specialty mattress maker Select Comfort Corp is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts’ average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, halting a run of four straight quarters where sales beat expectations. Investors will be looking out for the company’s Sleep Number mattress sales as well as for any changes in full-year outlook. The company provided 2015 profit forecast below estimates in February. On Friday, Apigee Corp, which develops software to manage web applications, is expected to raise up to $92 million in its IPO, valuing the company at about $523.8 million at the higher end of its IPO price range. The company’s software platform allows businesses to design and deploy application programming interfaces (API) to link its core IT systems with data used by customers, others. The company primarily offers application interface management and predictive analysis services. On Tuesday, Canadian Finance Minister Joe Oliver will present the annual federal budget for the fiscal year that began on April 1, the last budget before the general election scheduled for October. He has promised a balanced budget and has pledged to introduce balanced budget legislation as well. The Conservative government has already introduced a package of tax cuts and family benefits, and infrastructure spending, that has soaked up much of the anticipated surplus. A decline in oil prices has cut much of the remaining room for maneuver. Prime Minister Stephen Harper has ruled out major stimulus spending, arguing that despite cheap oil the economy was still growing. On Thursday Mexico’s national statistics office will release economic activity data for February, after the gauge expanded in January on a pickup in services and agriculture while industry sank. Also on Thursday, Mexico will release annual inflation data for the first half of April, after the indicator picked up to 3.14 in March, reaching just above the central bank’s 3 percent target. Retail sales data released on Friday will reveal how the gauge fared in February, after it rose at its fastest pace in over a year in January. Monday, April 20 International Business Machines Corp is expected to report lower revenue for the 12th straight quarter, as it exits unprofitable businesses and attempts to move into cloud-focused areas, away from its traditional hardware and consulting services foundation. Net profit for the first quarter is expected to rise slightly. Morgan Stanley is expected to report a rise in first-quarter earnings. The company’s institutional securities business now depends more on equities trading business, rather than fixed income trading. Rival Goldman Sachs’s strong performance in stock trading in the first quarter puts the spotlight on Morgan Stanley. The bank has also been focusing more on its wealth management business. It is trying to squeeze more revenue out of its major businesses by getting wealth clients to use investment banking and trading services. Ruth Porat, Morgan Stanley’s chief financial officer, who helped execute a sweeping cost-cutting strategy across several business lines at the bank, will step down to join Google as its finance chief next month. Halliburton Co is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit, hurt by soft drilling activity. Oil producers have significantly scaled back spending amid weak oil prices. However, cost cuts and continued strength in the Middle East and Asia are expected to help the oilfield services provider minimize the effects of the oil downturn. The company has said it would cut more than 6,000 jobs and investors will seek details about any further cost cuts, especially after Schlumberger cut 11,000 more jobs. Halliburton is looking to complete its $35 billion-acquisition of smaller rival Baker Hughes, which is expected to report its own first-quarter results on Tuesday. Investors will want to know about more potential asset sales after Halliburton said earlier it would sell three businesses to pave the way for regulatory clearance for the deal. Investors will also look to see if the deal will help it better cope with pricing pressure from oil producers. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, the world’s second-largest cruise operator by revenue, is expected to report first-quarter profit and sales below analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company had forecast revenue below expectations, citing a strong dollar and weak pricing in the Caribbean. Investors will be looking out for any changes in full-year forecast and comments on the Caribbean market, as well as updates on expansion in Europe and Asia. Toymaker Hasbro Inc will report first-quarter results before the bell. The sequels of “Jurassic Park” and “The Avengers” in first half of 2015 and the new “Star Wars” movie in December are expected to boost Hasbro’s sales this year and keep it growing at a faster pace than larger rival Mattel Inc’s. Canadian National Railway reports its financial results for the first quarter. On average, analysts are expecting earnings to rise to 85 Canadian cents a share from 66 Canadian cents a year earlier, as revenue increases to C$3.04 billion. The company may discuss its safety record and the costs associated with its recent string of derailments as cleanup continues near the town of Gogama, in northern Ontario.  Rogers Communications Inc, Canada’s largest wireless phone provider and a major cable and media company, reports results for the first quarter. The company has lost ground in wireless and other subscriber metrics in recent quarters but has been able on average to charge its customers more, a trend investors will be eager to appraise.

At 12:21 p.m. the Dow Jones industrial average was up 52.28 points, or 0.29 percent, at 18,090.55, the S&P; 500  was higher 6.1 points, or 0.29 percent, at 2,114.06 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 13.76 points, or 0.27 percent, at 5,048.93. The Nasdaq had closed at a record-high of 5048.62 in March 2000 that signaled the top of the dot-com bubble. All 10 major S&P; sectors were higher, helped by a 2 percent rise in the teleservices index and a 1 percent advance in the energy sector. Both Brent and U.S. crude futures rose more than 3 percent on heightened concerns over the security of Middle East supplies as a civil war escalated in Yemen. “The energy markets flattened out over the last month and it actually appears that you will probably see stronger energy prices,” said Scott Colyer, CEO of Advisors Asset Management in Monument, Colorado. The higher oil prices helped investors shrug off a raft of disappointing results and forecasts. PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble and 3M all blamed the strong dollar for missing estimates or cutting forecasts. P&G; fell 2 percent to $81.41, 3M fell 2.2 percent to $161.05 and Pepsi was down 1.2 percent at $96.06. Facebook fell 1.1 percent to $83.64 on Thursday, a day after posting quarterly revenue that missed analysts estimates.

A slight but unexpected rise in U.S. applications for unemployment insurance also pressured indexes lower, while growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector dipped more than expected in April. Business activity slowed more than expected in the euro zone this month while manufacturing in Asia’s top two economies hit the brakes, suggesting the global recovery path is less clear than policymakers are predicting. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 295,000 for the week ended April 18, above the forecast of 290,000. The data and earnings-related weakness was offset by a 0.8 percent advance in the S&P; 500 energy sector. Both Brent and U.S. crude futures rose more than 3 percent on heightened concerns over the security of Middle East supplies as a civil war escalated in Yemen. “The energy markets flattened out over the last month and it actually appears that you will probably see stronger energy prices,” said Scott Colyer, CEO of Advisors Asset Management in Monument, Colorado.

416,PG,Procter & Gamble's sales fall for fifth straight quarter,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) sales fell for the fifth straight quarter as a stronger dollar took its toll, with currency fluctuations likely to hurt 2015 sales by 6-7 percent. The world’s largest household products maker, which gets roughly two-thirds of sales from outside the United States,    reported a steeper-than-expected 8.3 percent fall in quarterly sales on Thursday. Procter & Gamble expects to start at least 18 new manufacturing plants in developing markets in the next few years as a measure to further localize its supply chain and mitigate foreign currency fluctuations, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on an earnings conference call.     The company is also driving savings from cost of goods sold to $1.6 billion this year, ahead of its $1.2 billion target per year along with increasing manufacturing productivity by 5 percent this year, he said. In the past the company has recovered between half and two-thirds of significant devaluation in developing currencies through pricing but the recovery will be less this year due to competitive pressures, Moeller said. “This time it will be less than that because many of our internationally domiciled competitors..aren’t seeing the full extent of the pressure that we are seeing,” he said. Sales for the maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers fell to $18.14 billion in the third quarter ended March 31, hit 8 percentage points by a strong dollar and 1 percentage point by the planned divestitures of some brands. Sales in the company’s beauty, hair and personal care products business fell for the ninth quarter in a row, dragging down P&G;’s total sales and volumes. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $18.49 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to P&G; fell to $2.15 billion, or 75 cents per share, in the third quarter ended March 31, from $2.61 billion, or 90 cents per share, a year earlier. Since August, where P&G; outlined a plan to sell slow-growing brands and cut jobs to revive sales growth, a total of 40 brands have either been sold, discontinued or will be consolidated, Moeller said. The new company will retain 65 leading brands and the consumer goods maker will be in a position to announce a large part of its brand divestiture program by as early as this summer, he said. On an adjusted basis, the company’s earnings of 92 cents per share were in line with analysts’ average estimate. Up to Wednesday’s close, P&G; stock had fallen nearly 9 percent this year.

421,PG,WRAPUP 2-Weak U.S. business spending data hints at sluggish growth rebound,"(Adds details, analyst comments, updates markets) * Core capital goods orders fall 0.5 percent in March * Core capital goods shipments slip 0.4 percent * Durable goods orders jump 4.0 percent on transportation By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON, April 24 (Reuters) - U.S. business investment spending plans fell for a seventh straight month in March, weighed down by a strong dollar and lower energy prices, suggesting the economy was struggling to rebound from a recent soft patch. The report from the Commerce Department on Friday came on the heels of lukewarm data on retail sales, employment and housing starts that have hinted at insufficient growth momentum that could prompt the Federal Reserve to delay raising interest rates until later this year. “This is consistent with a sluggish rebound in growth. It’s shedding more doubt on the Fed’s willingness to raise rates mid-year,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York. Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, declined 0.5 percent last month after a revised 2.2 percent drop in February, which was the biggest decline since July 2013. The so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have declined 1.1 percent in February. Economists had forecast these orders gaining 0.3 percent last month. The weakness mirrors other manufacturing indicators such as industrial production and various regional factory surveys. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies after the report, while prices for U.S. government debt rose. U.S. stocks were trading marginally higher as investors were cheered by strong results from Google Inc, Amazon.com Inc  and Microsoft Corp. The Fed has kept overnight interest rates near zero since December 2008, but a number of officials have said an increase will likely be considered at its June policy-setting meeting. Manufacturing has been undermined by the buoyant dollar, whose 12.1 percent appreciation against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners since last June has eroded overseas profits of multinational companies like Procter & Gamble Co. The world’s largest household products maker on Thursday reported a 8.3 percent decline in quarterly sales. In addition, lower energy prices have cut into domestic oil production, reducing demand for equipment by oil-field companies, including Schlumberger and Halliburton . Schlumberger, the world’s No.1 oil-field services provider, has cut its capital expenditure plans for this year by about $500 million to $2.5 billion. Halliburton slashed its capex by about 15 percent to $2.8 billion. “Cheap oil and a strong dollar, while beneficial to consumers, are putting serious pressure on manufacturers,” said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial in New York. The dollar and reduced capex spending by oil-field firms combined with a harsh winter and softer global demand to slow U.S. growth at the start of the year. In March, shipments of core capital goods - which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government’s gross domestic product measurement - fell 0.4 percent after a downwardly revised 0.1 percent gain in February. Shipments in February were previously reported to have risen 0.3 percent. As a result, JPMorgan lowered its first-quarter GDP growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 0.6 percent annual pace. Barclays trimmed its forecast to a 1.1 percent rate from a 1.2 percent pace. The economy expanded at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter. The government will publish its snapshot of first-quarter GDP next Wednesday. Pointing to prolonged weakness in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, unfilled orders for core capital goods fell for a second straight month in March after barely rising in January. “We have not seen the full ramifications of the strong dollar and the drop in oil-related investment, so that could continue to play out,” said Thomas Costerg, a U.S. economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. “The focus is now on services and consumers in the hope that they are going to pick up the tab. So far we are not seeing signs of that.” A surge in transportation equipment buoyed overall orders for durable goods - items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more - which rebounded 4.0 percent last month. That was the largest increase since July last year and followed a 1.4 percent decline in February.

422,PG,WRAPUP 3-Anemic U.S. factory data points to moderate growth bounce,"(Recasts with final auto sales data) * Manufacturing activity muted, strong dollar cited * Auto sales slow in April after March’s robust pace * Consumer sentiment rises in April from March * Construction spending hits six-month low in March By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON, May 1 (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity failed to gain steam in April after slowing for five straight months and demand for automobiles softened, suggesting the economy was struggling to find momentum after growth almost stalled in the first quarter. Other data on Friday showed construction spending hit a six-month low in March, also indicating that the anticipated acceleration in growth in the second quarter could disappoint.   That could see the Federal Reserve delaying raising interest rates until later this year. The economy expanded at a 0.2 percent annual pace in the first three months of the year, slammed by bad weather, a strong dollar and a now-resolved labor dispute at the West Coast ports, as well as lower oil prices, which have undercut domestic energy production. “The reacceleration in growth will not come fast enough for many, especially those looking for a liftoff by the Fed to happen sooner,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in New York. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity was at 51.5 in April, matching the March reading, which had been the lowest since May 2013. The index had declined since November and economists had expected it to rise to 52 in April. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector. While new orders rose last month, a gauge of factory employment contracted for the first time since May 2013 and recorded its lowest reading since September 2009. Manufacturing has been hit by the dollar’s 12 percent appreciation against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners since June. The buoyant currency has hurt export growth and profits of multinational corporations, including Procter & Gamble Co , the world’s largest household products maker, and prompted Colgate-Palmolive and healthcare conglomerate  Johnson & Johnson to cut their profit forecasts for the full year. Whirlpool Corp, the world’s largest maker of home appliances, lowered its profit forecast and sales outlook for 2015. Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, is also being pressured by the lower oil prices, which have caused oil-field companies to slash spending on exploration and well drilling. Caterpillar Inc has warned the dollar and weak oil prices will hurt profits this year. U.S. stocks closed higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury debt prices fell. Separately, auto sales fell to an annualized pace of 16.45 million vehicles last month from a 17.15 million-unit rate in March. However, General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co  reported stronger-than-expected U.S. auto sales in April on robust demand for trucks, and crossover and sports utility vehicles. Demand for autos is likely to pick up in the months ahead. In another report, the University of Michigan said its overall index on consumer sentiment rose to 95.9 this month, the second highest level since 2007, from 93.0 in March. Consumers were upbeat about both current conditions and expectations for the future. More consumers said it was a good time to buy a major household item and a vehicle. There was also an increase in consumers saying it was a good time to buy and sell a house, which should support home sales. “This suggests that there may be some upside risk for durable goods spending in the second quarter ... and that perhaps housing market activity will pick up in the months ahead,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. In a fourth report, the Commerce Department said construction spending slipped 0.6 percent to an annual rate of $966.6 billion in March, the lowest level since September. Construction spending was weighed down by a 1.6 percent decline in private residential construction spending, the biggest such decline since June. Public construction outlays were also weak. “We think the outlook for residential construction is positive in 2015 as household formation appears to have picked up and as house price gains have remained firm,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

423,PG,"WRAPUP 2-U.S. factory orders rebound solidly, but trend still soft","(Adds details, background, analyst comments, updates markets) * Factory orders rise 2.1 percent on transportation * Orders excluding transportation unchanged * March core capital goods orders revised up By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON, May 4 (Reuters) - New orders for U.S. factory goods recorded their biggest increase in eight months in March, boosted by demand for transportation equipment, but the underlying trend remained weak against the backdrop of a strong dollar. The report on Monday from the Commerce Department was the latest indication that the rebound from the first quarter’s abrupt slowdown would not be as strong as experienced during the same period last year when output was chilled by cold weather. “It was a difficult winter for manufacturers and it appears they are still hurting after the strong run in the dollar late last year,” said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. New orders for manufactured goods increased 2.1 percent, the largest gain since July last year, after dipping 0.1 percent in February. It was the first rise since last August and was buoyed by a 13.5 percent jump in orders for transportation equipment. Orders excluding transportation were flat in March. February’s 0.1 percent gain in orders for manufactured goods outside transportation was the first rise since June. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with healthcare shares leading the way. Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, has been hit by the strong dollar and lower crude oil prices, which are putting a squeeze on the profits of multinational corporations and oil firms. That together with harsh weather and a now-settled labor dispute at the West Coast ports helped to hold the economy down to a 0.2 percent annual growth pace in the first quarter. The factory data added to reports on auto sales, housing and employment in suggesting the economy was regaining some speed, but probably not fast enough to encourage the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates next month, as most economists had anticipated at the beginning of the year. The dollar has appreciated 12 percent against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners since June on expectations of tighter monetary policy and economists estimate it could shave 0.6 percentage point off growth this year. Companies like Schlumberger, the world’s No.1 oil-field services provider, and Halliburton have slashed their capital expenditure for this year citing lower oil prices. Multinational corporations, including Procter & Gamble Co , the world’s largest household products maker, Colgate-Palmolive and Whirlpool Corp, the world’s largest maker of home appliances, have lowered their profit forecasts for the year because of the dollar. The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - edged up 0.1 percent instead of the 0.5 percent drop reported last month. “Seldom do things look this bad for the factory sector outside of recession,” said Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. “We still maintain that things will improve as the year progresses. The bulk of the declines in activity related to lower energy prices has run its course, baring another significant down leg for oil prices.” Supporting the cautious optimism, order books at factories  rose a bit in March after three straight months of declines. Further gains are likely after a report last week showed some stabilization in factory activity in April after slowing for five straight months, as well as a solid rise in new orders.

424,PG,"INSIGHT-New breed of food execs raised on mergers, not marketing","* Private equity mentality spreads in consumer sector * Highlights importance of financial prowess * JAB, Nomad Foods have links to 3G-controlled AB InBev By Martinne Geller LONDON, May 21 (Reuters) - The consumer goods world has long been dominated by marketing whiz kids raised through the ranks of Procter & Gamble or PepsiCo, but the executives now in demand come from a new school that values cost-cutting and mergers over marketing. The new playbook, embodied by U.S. private equity firm 3G Capital, applies cutthroat Wall Street sensibilities to Main Street shopping aisles, demanding the highest performance from  fewer people willing to work extra hard and progress quickly. The spread of a private equity mentality to more of the largest names in the sector exacerbates the pressure on finance chiefs, already wading through increased volatility of commodities and currencies, and highlights the need for financial prowess outside the finance department. The 3G management philosophy was developed by three Brazilian investment bankers and pioneered at Budweiser brewer Anheuser Busch InBev, the world’s biggest brewer, which they helped create through a series of big mergers. It is now also in effect at Burger King owner Restaurant Brands International where they are major shareholders, and ketchup maker Heinz which they have bought. Soon it will arrive at Kraft Foods, which is being bought by Heinz. The Brazilians have demonstrated that the private equity model can be implemented on a large scale, potentially creating big winners and losers in a low-growth sector. Private equity firms in general are known for a more aggressive culture than marketing-focused consumer goods companies, with more competition and a higher turnover rate among executives, said Gary Stibel, CEO of New England Consulting Group. He said more consumer firms are adopting some of those philosophies, but it is not always a good fit. “They have a maniacal focus on cash and results,” Stibel said. “You’ve got to be very careful about putting a bull in a china shop unless you’re prepared to have a lot of broken glass.” After 3G teamed up with billionaire investor Warren Buffett to buy Heinz in 2013, they closed six factories and cut 7,000 jobs in 18 months. Operating margins jumped from 18 percent to 26 percent. Part of the 3G playbook is zero-based budgeting (ZBB), which forces managers to justify each year’s costs from scratch rather than assume the previous year’s budget as a starting point. While 3G is often seen as extreme - at Heinz they limited employee use of company printers to 200 pages per month, required double-sided printing - ZBB is being adopted elsewhere, such as at Cadbury chocolate maker Mondelez International . Executives familiar with the strategy are in demand as other companies seek to repeat the trick. “Anyone who worked at ABI (AB InBev) or Heinz under the 3G regime would be very appealing to the market, because of their familiarity with ZBB,” said Fabio Vacirca, head of the consumer goods and services group at consultancy Accenture. As industry-wide sales have slowed for packaged food makers such as Kellogg, Campbell Soup and General Mills , all eyes have turned to profits. 3G’s founders Jorge Paulo Lemann, Marcel Telles and Carlos Alberto Sicupira developed their management style at Banco Garantia, the investment bank they founded in Brazil in the 1970s. After selling it to Credit Suisse in 1998, they formed private equity firm 3G to invest in U.S. consumer names. Lemann, Brazil’s richest man and a former tennis pro, once served on the board of Gillette, where he met Buffett, who has partnered with Lemann on Heinz and Kraft and has said he would like to do more deals. A shakeup in finance departments throughout the packaged goods sector suggests the emphasis on dealmaking and cost-cutting is putting new pressure on a side of the business that used to take a back seat to marketing. Unilever announced the departure of its chief financial officer Jean-Marc Huet on Tuesday, becoming the fifth major consumer products firm to change the post in recent months, following Heineken, Danone, Nestle  and SABMiller. “Maybe it is just becoming a more pressurized and intense job as the CFOs are being required to actually become more operationally involved in all that cost-cutting rather than just adding up the numbers,” said one investment bank analyst covering the sector, who declined to be identified by name. Since the credit crunch, companies have been increasingly naming finance experts as CEOs and board members, “because it’s been more about management of those risks as opposed to the more expansive agenda that perhaps marketeers had traditionally been better suited to,” said Will Hayllar, co-leader of the global consumer goods team at OC&C; Strategy Consultants. Dealmaking activity is requiring a lot of attention from top executives, SABMiller’s interim CFO, Domenic De Lorenzo, told reporters last week: “Conversations, evaluations, looking at transactions, that’s still a big part of everyone’s day-to-day job in this industry.” Many of the dealmakers and financiers taking up top jobs in the industry have outright connections to 3G and AB InBev. Stefan Descheemaeker, the executive who led Belgium’s Interbrew into the merger that formed the precursor to AB InBev, will soon take charge of Birdseye frozen foods owner Iglo Foods as the new CEO of acquisition firm Nomad Holdings. Olivier Goudet, a veteran of the 2008 takeover of Wrigley by Mars, has been named as both the new chairman of AB InBev and as CEO at JAB Holdings, the family office of the German billionaire Reimann family which is putting together the world’s largest pure-play coffee company. JAB’s former CEO Peter Harf also served as AB InBev chairman. The tumult helps the sector to be seen as a hot field for aspiring managers. Work in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector became the most popular destination for business students last year, eclipsing banking for the first time, according to a global survey by Deloitte. Deloitte’s Margaret Doyle, who worked on the report, pointed to an increased number of female students, who she said often lean toward marketing jobs, and a weakening of the banking industry, whose reputation was bruised by the financial crisis. “FMCG companies have always been perceived as having well-regarded graduate programmes,” said Doyle, head of financial services insight at Deloitte. “People are initiated through different parts of the business - they get to market shampoo, market washing powder, they experience a real rotation which is a great foundation.” Procter & Gamble for decades was seen as one of the best breeding grounds for business executives, due to its world-class talent programme and reputation for promoting from within. Aside from consumer leaders like Unilever CEO Paul Polman and Estee Lauder CEO Fabrizio Freda, P&G; alums include General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt and former Microsoft boss Steve Ballmer. Yet industry bankers said they could they could see why new graduates might like to work for 3G, despite its culture being so thrifty that even top executives abide by restrictions on travel and entertainment. “Come to them, and they’ll teach you as much about consumer products marketing as anyone else, but they’ll also show you how to develop that playbook,” said one banker.

Asked if Wella could find a new home at L’Oreal, Nicolas Hieronimus was quoted as saying: “No.” Sources close to the matter said last month that personal care and cosmetics companies Henkel & Co, Revlon  and Coty were preparing bids for parts of Procter & Gamble’s beauty business. They said L’Oreal was looking at potentially buying P&G;’s perfume and cosmetics business. Henkel is interested in P&G;’s haircare unit, which includes the Wella and Clairol brands, the sources said. The haircare business is worth about $7 billion based on annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of around $500 million, the sources said. Asked why L’Oreal would not be interested in Wella, Hieronimus said: “As global market leader, we are already very well established among hair salons with our own brands.” Asked if L’Oreal needed in general to buy new brands, the executive said the group had an “optimal brand portfolio” but that it would always look at new opportunities. “We have an optimal brand portfolio today. You can see that from the fact that we are growing 1 1/2 times as fast as the market worldwide. Still, we always look at new opportunities,” Hieronimus said.

427,PG,WRAPUP 4-U.S. economy contracts in Q1; dollar hurts corporate profits,"(Adds consumer sentiment, factory data, updates markets) * First-quarter GDP revised down to show contraction * GDP shrinks at a 0.7 percent annual rate * Trade, inventories account for bulk of revision * Strong dollar weighs on Q1 corporate profits By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON, May 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter as it buckled under the weight of unusually heavy snowfalls, a resurgent dollar and disruptions at West Coast ports, but activity already has rebounded modestly. The government on Friday slashed its gross domestic product estimate to show GDP shrinking at a 0.7 percent annual rate instead of the 0.2 percent growth pace it estimated last month. A larger trade deficit and a smaller accumulation of inventories by businesses than previously thought accounted for much of the downward revision. There was also a modest downward revision to consumer spending. With growth estimates for the second quarter currently around 2 percent, the economy appears poised for its worst first-half performance since 2011. The economy’s recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis has been erratic. Weak data on consumer sentiment and factory activity in the Midwest on Friday suggested that while the economy has pulled out of its first-quarter soft patch, the growth pace was modest early in the second quarter. That mirrored other recent soft data on retail sales and industrial production. But reports on housing and business spending plans have indicated momentum could be building, which would keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates later this year. Economists caution against reading too much into the slump in output. They argue the GDP figure for the first quarter was held down by a confluence of temporary factors, including a problem with the model the government uses to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations. Economists, including those at the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, have cast doubts on the accuracy of GDP estimates for the first quarter, which have tended to show weakness over the last several years. They argued the so-called seasonal adjustment is not fully stripping out seasonal patterns, leaving “residual” seasonality. The government said last week it was aware of the potential problem and was working to minimize it. “Obviously the economy is weaker than we would like it to be, but the first quarter overstates that,” said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica in Dallas. “We’re going see enough growth to keep job creation in place and allow the Fed to maintain their lift-off schedule for September.” When measured from the income side, the economy expanded at a 1.4 percent rate in the first quarter. A measure of domestic demand growth was revised up slightly and business spending on equipment was much stronger than previously estimated, taking some edge off the slump in output. U.S. Treasuries were trading higher, while the dollar was largely unchanged against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street fell. Apart from the statistical quirk, the economy, which expanded at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter, was hammered by a sharp decline in investment spending in the energy sector as companies such as Schlumberger and Halliburton  responded to the plunge in crude oil prices. Spending on mining exploration, shafts and wells plunged at a 48.6 percent pace in the first quarter, the largest drop since the second quarter of 2009. Economists estimate unusually heavy snowfalls in February chopped at least one percentage point from growth. Trade was hit both by the strong dollar and the ports labor dispute, which weighed on exports through the quarter and then unleashed a flood of imports in March after it was resolved. That resulted in a trade deficit that subtracted 1.90 percentage points from GDP, the largest drag in 31 years, instead of the 1.25 percentage points reported last month. The GDP report also showed after-tax corporate profits declined 8.7 percent. That was the largest drop in a year and the second quarterly fall, as the strong dollar burdened multinational corporations and oil prices hurt domestic firms. Multinationals like Microsoft Corp, household products maker Procter & Gamble Co and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson have warned the dollar will hit sales and profits this year. Unlike 2014, when growth snapped back quickly after a dismal first quarter, the dollar and investment cuts by energy companies continue to hamstring activity. But growth could accelerate as the year progresses. The value of inventory accumulated in the first quarter was revised down to an increase of $95 billion from the lofty $110.3 billion rise reported last month. That meant inventories contributed 0.33 percentage point to GDP instead of the previously reported 0.74 percentage point, suggesting warehouses are not bulging with unwanted merchandise and businesses have latitude to order more goods from factories. While consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was revised down by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 1.8 percent rate, it could finally get a lift from the considerable savings households amassed because of cheaper gasoline. Personal savings increased at a robust $726.4 billion pace. “The outlook for the economy is very encouraging,” said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.

Henkel made an offer for P&G;’s haircare business, which includes the Wella and Clairol brands, and could fetch a valuation of $5 billion to $7 billion, the people said. While Henkel is considered to be the most likely buyer, private equity firm KKR & Co LP (KKR.N) also submitted a bid for the haircare business, the people added. Coty, which makes perfume for fashion brands Calvin Klein and Marc Jacobs and owns nail polish brand OPI and Rimmel mascara, has submitted bids for P&G;’s fragrance unit and its cosmetics business.  Buyout firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC also submitted a bid for P&G;’s cosmetics business, which includes drugstore brands CoverGirl and Max Factor and could fetch around $3 billion in a sale.

Shares of biotech companies were among the biggest drags, including Biogen, down 1.1 percent at $382. The Nasdaq Biotech Index was down 0.7 percent. The S&P; financials were up 0.3 percent, helped by prospects for higher interest rates, while S&P; consumer staples  rose 0.5 percent, led by a 1.5 percent gain in Procter & Gamble “People are sick of timing the Fed when it comes to this sector. People don’t want to miss the boat,” said Andrew Frankel, co-president of Stuart Frankel & Co in New York  regarding the rise in financial shares. Another batch of strong economic data underscored views that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates in September. Data showed that U.S. job openings surged to a record high in April and small business confidence increased in May, signs that the economy was regaining momentum after stumbling at the start of the year. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.51 points, or 0.01 percent, to 17,764.04, the S&P; 500 gained 0.87 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,080.15 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 7.76 points, or 0.15 percent, to 5,013.87. The Dow Jones transportation average ended down 0.3 percent, just shy of correction territory, which would be a drop of 10 percent from its Dec. 29, 2014, record close of 9,217.44. “It’s a market that’s searching for a rationale at this point ... and waiting for next week’s (Fed) meeting,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, which is based in Newark, New Jersey. Shares of Procter & Gamble climbed 1.5 percent to $78.90, leading gains in the staples sector, after Reuters, citing people familiar with the matter, reported late Monday that Henkel & Co and Coty Inc made binding offers to buy separate parts of Procter & Gamble Co’s beauty businesses. Shares of Hovnanian Enterprises dropped 9.8 percent to $2.86, the lowest since 2012, after disappointing results. Lululemon shares rose 11 percent to $68.27 after the Canadian yogawear retailer raised its full-year revenue and earnings forecast. Sage Therapeutics jumped 15.4 percent to $86.71 after its experimental injectable drug was found to be effective in treating postpartum depression. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,976 to 1,066, for a 1.85-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,645 issues fell and 1,093 advanced for a 1.51-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.

434,PG,"WRAPUP 2-U.S. industrial output hurt by weakness in manufacturing, mining","(Adds details, housing data, updates markets) * Industrial production falls 0.2 percent in May * Manufacturing output slips 0.2 percent * Mining production drops 0.3 percent * New York state factory activity gauge falls in June By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON, June 15 (Reuters) - U.S. industrial production unexpectedly fell in May as manufacturing and mining activity remained weak, a sign that a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector continued to constrain economic growth. The softness in the production side of the economy contrasts starkly with recent upbeat data on retail sales, employment, consumer and small business confidence, which have pointed to a growth pickup after a sluggish start to the second quarter. “Signs of spring remain largely absent in the industrial sector. The challenges of the stronger dollar and drop in energy  prices linger,” said Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. Industrial output slipped 0.2 percent last month after declining 0.5 percent in April, the Federal Reserve said on Monday. Industrial production has been weak since December, and  economists had expected output to rise 0.2 percent last month. The data was likely to get the attention of Fed policymakers who meet on Tuesday and Wednesday, economists said. The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise interest rates at this week’s policy meeting, but rather to wait until later this year. Industrial production last month was held down by a 0.2 percent drop in manufacturing output. Manufacturing has been whacked by a strong dollar, which has eroded the profits of multinational corporations. Companies like Microsoft Corp and Procter & Gamble Co, the world’s largest household products maker, and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson have warned the dollar will hit sales and profits this year. The dollar has gained about 13.2 percent against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners since last June largely on expectations of tighter U.S. monetary policy. U.S. financial markets were little moved by Monday’s data as investors kept a wary eye on Greece, which inched closer to defaulting on its debt. U.S. stocks were trading lower, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. government debt rose. Although motor vehicle production, machinery, and computer and electronic products increased last month, it was not enough to offset the drag on manufacturing output from declines in the production of electrical equipment, appliances and components, fabricated metal products and wood products. Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy and more than 72 percent of industrial production, was also weighed down by falling output of nondurable goods such as food and petroleum products. It is likely to remain weak in the months ahead. In a separate report, the New York Fed said its Empire State general business conditions index dropped to a reading of minus 1.98 in June from 3.09 in May. That was the weakest reading since January 2013 and the second negative reading in the past three months. A gauge of new orders contracted, while shipments edged down. Though a measure of unfilled orders increased last month, it remained in contraction territory, indicating order books remained weak. “Manufacturers will continue to struggle with the impact of the dollar’s rise for some time yet,” said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. But given manufacturing’s small share of the economy and recent signs of a sharp pickup in growth in the non-factory sectors, Ashworth said “there is every reason to believe that GDP growth will average between 2.5 percent to 3.0 percent annualized over the rest of this year.” That upbeat assessment was bolstered by a third report showing confidence among homebuilders vaulted to an eight-month high in June, suggesting the housing market recovery was gaining traction. Housing is expected to take up some of the slack from weak manufacturing. GDP contracted in the first quarter, slammed by bad weather, port disruptions, dollar strength and energy sector spending cuts. Last month, mining production fell 0.3 percent, the fifth straight monthly decline, as oil and gas well drilling and servicing fell 7.9 percent after plunging 14.5 percent in April. That took the cumulative drop since the end of 2014 to 51.8 percent. But the pace of decline in oil and gas well drilling and servicing is moderating, suggesting the worst of the spending cuts is over. Companies like Schlumberger, the world’s No. 1 oilfield services provider, and Halliburton have slashed their capital spending budgets for this year. Oil and gas production, however, increased 0.5 percent in May. Unseasonably warm weather last month lifted demand for air conditioning, leading to a 0.2 percent increase in utilities production. The amount of industrial capacity in use last month fell to its lowest level since January 2014.

437,PG,"US STOCKS-Wall St up with eyes on Greece, Fed; M&A; supports","* NCR rallies on report of deal with Blackstone, Carlyle * Coty up on P&G; deal * Indexes up: Dow 0.64 pct, S&P; 0.57 pct, Nasdaq 0.51 pct   (Updates to close, changes byline) By Rodrigo Campos June 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday following back-to-back daily declines, with merger activity more than offsetting market concerns as Greece struggles to avoid a default on its debt. Traders also kept an eye on interest rates as a two-day policy-setting meeting at the Federal Reserve got under way. Despite the collapse of talks between Athens and its European and IMF lenders over the weekend, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew that Athens aimed to reach a deal. Lew said failure to reach an agreement would create broad uncertainties for the global economy. “The market seems to be pricing in a possibility, overpricing, a Greece exit,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. He said he does not expect a surprise to the market from the Fed in terms of a rate hike, or from a Greek default. “Financials have been leading and dividend payers have sold off. That trade probably unwinds if there is a surprise,” he said. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 113.31 points, or 0.64 percent, to 17,904.48, the S&P; 500 gained 11.86 points, or 0.57 percent, to 2,096.29 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 25.58 points, or 0.51 percent, to 5,055.55. Stocks had opened lower but quickly turned higher and drifted up throughout the day to close near the session’s high. Consumer staples lead the way up, with Coty shares at a record, closing up 19.3 percent at $31.08. Coty is on track to buy Procter & Gamble’s beauty business in a $12 billion deal. P&G; shares closed up 1.3 percent at $79.10. In other merger news, shares of NCR Corp hit a 14-month high of $36.50. Reuters reported Blackstone and Carlyle are making a joint bid for NCR in what would be the year’s biggest leveraged buyout at more than $10 billion, including debt. NCR closed up 10.7 percent at $34.73 while Blackstone fell 0.6 percent to $41.98 and Carlyle rose 0.8 percent to $28.41. The chance that the Fed Wednesday will give more clarity on the timing of its expected rate hike was seen as a catalyst for more takeover deals. “Rising rates could be a trigger for even more M&A; activity,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. “They are a signal that now’s the time to get the deals done if you are going to do them with cheap financing.” Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,946 to 1,104, for a 1.76-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,635 issues rose and 1,158 fell for a 1.41-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.

440,PG,Coty nears deal to buy P&G; businesses for about $12 bln - source,"June 15 (Reuters) - U.S. cosmetics group Coty has won auctions to acquire three businesses from Procter & Gamble Co for as much as $12 billion, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Reuters reported last week that Henkel & Co KGaA AG  and Coty, both of which have personal care and cosmetics businesses, made binding offers to buy separate parts of P&G;’s beauty businesses. P&G;, the world’s largest household products maker, has been looking to sell several assets it considers non-core as part of its cost-cutting strategy. Coty, which has a market value of $9.39 billion and makes perfume for fashion brands Calvin Klein and Marc Jacobs and owns nail polish brand OPI and Rimmel mascara, has been looking to expand its products portfolio. Coty outbid other potential buyers vying for P&G;’s hair-care, fragrant and cosmetics businesses, the source said, asking not to be identified because the matter is not public. The source cautioned that the deal, had not yet been finalized. The deal was first reported by the New York Post. Coty refused to comment when contacted by Reuters. P&G; was not immediately available for comment.

441,PG,REFILE-UPDATE 3-Coty on track to clinch P&G; beauty deal in coming weeks-sources,"(Refiles to fix typo in Procter in first paragraph) * Coty, P&G; deal to take weeks to finalise - sources * JAB to own third of equity, 47-48 pct of voting rights * Deal would make Coty No. 1 perfume and hair care company By Astrid Wendlandt PARIS, June 16 (Reuters) - Coty is on track to acquire Procter & Gamble’s  beauty business in a $12 billion deal that would make the U.S. cosmetic company the world leader in perfume and hair care, sources close to the matter said. If the deal goes though, Coty would get its hands on brands such as Gucci and Hugo Boss perfume, Wella and Clairol hair care products and Max Factor and Cover Girl make-up, part of its strategy to reverse its own declining sales trends. For P&G;, the sale is part of a large plan to narrow its focus on fewer, faster-growing brands. The world’s No. 1 household products maker said in August it could sell about half of its slow-growing brands over the next two years. Last year, it sold its Duracell batteries to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc for $4.7 billion and sold some of its soap brands to Unilever Plc. Coty was vying with Henkel for P&G;’s hair care businesses and won an auction over the weekend, the sources said, adding that details of the complex transaction are likely to take at least two weeks to be finalised. For tax purposes, the deal would be completed through a “Reverse Morris Trust”, which means that P&G; would spin off its beauty assets into a separate company that would then absorb Coty in an all-share deal, the sources said. Luxembourg-based JAB Holdings, the billionaire Reimann family’s investment firm which controls 75 percent of Coty, would own about a third of the equity in the combined business and about 47-48 percent of voting rights, the sources said. P&G;, Coty and JAB Holdings declined to comment. In New York trade, Coty shares closed 19.3 percent higher and have gained about 50 percent this year. P&G; shares rose 1.3 percent. Wells Fargo analyst Chris Ferrara said a deal would be “transformational” for Coty and estimated it would increase its revenue to nearly $11 billion from $4.4 billion. “A large deal would likely give Coty the opportunity to quickly exit ‘tail’ (poorly performing) brands and sustainably raise the company’s growth profile,” Ferrara said. In response to lower sales, Coty has been cutting costs and shedding staff. It has also been through much organisational change, merging divisions and replacing chief executives three times in the past three years. Elio Sceti, who ran Europe’s largest frozen foods company Iglo Foods Holdings and has no experience in the cosmetics industry, will become Coty’s chief executive next month. Coty, which makes Marc Jacobs, Calvin Klein, Chloe as well as celebrity perfumes, would become the world’s No.1 perfume maker ahead of L’Oreal if the deal goes through, according to market research firm Euromonitor International. This would also mark its entry into the hair care market with the Wella and Clairol brands. In make-up, Coty, which has a significant presence in Britain and France, would gain a much bigger stronghold in the United States. JAB controls fashion brands Bally and Belstaff, shoe maker Jimmy Choo and coffee company D.E Master Blenders 1753, which is set to merge with the coffee business of Mondelez International. JAB’s assets under management reached $39 billion this year, up from $14 billion in December 2011.

442,PG,"CORRECTED-Ad execs cautious about growth, gear up for contract battle","(Corrects figures on Publicis contract wins, paragraph 13) * WPP’s Sorrell says trading tough this year * Publicis’ Levy say account reviews offer risk, opportunity * Ad market forecast to grow around 4.2 pct this year By Leila Abboud CANNES, June 26 (Reuters) - The reluctance of big companies to spend at a time of lacklustre global growth and fewer major sporting events this year are dampening demand for advertising, said the chief executives of two leading ad agencies. In separate interviews on Friday, Martin Sorrell of WPP  and Maurice Levy of Publicis sounded cautious about the prospects for the advertising market, citing a lack of vibrancy in the U.S economy, weakness in Brazil, Russia and China, and Europe’s continued fragility. “There is a lot of uncertainty,” Levy told Reuters. “Companies have cash to spend but are not in the mood to do so, and consumers are not feeling confident either.” Research firm Zenith Optimedia, owned by Publicis, recently cut its growth forecast for the global advertising market to 4.2 percent down from 4.9 percent earlier this year. For his part, Sorrell said that the major companies served by WPP agencies such as Ogilvy and Mather and Group M were very focused on cost controls, sometimes to the detriment of long-term investment in their brands and products. “Business is tough. Clients are very demanding in an environment where top-line growth is lower than it was before the financial crisis began,” he said. Against that backdrop, the world’s top six ad agencies face upheaval because an unprecedented $27 billion in media buying and planning contracts are up for review in the coming months at companies including Coca-Cola, Procter and Gamble  and L’Oreal. That is requiring them to defend some major contracts, while trying to steal others from rivals. Morgan Stanley estimated that Publicis was the most exposed, with 1.7 percent of sales at risk and 2.5 percent of earnings per share. It is defending seven contracts including P&G;, General Mills, Twenty-First Century Fox and Coca-Cola. For WPP, about 1.1 percent of revenue and 1.6 percent of earnings per share are risk as it seeks to keep nine contracts including Volkswagen and Unilever. Both Sorrell and Levy claimed the reviews were an opportunity to win business, while acknowledging that the fees would be lower on the new deals than the old ones. “The reviews are worrying for the agencies but their effects will also be felt on media owners because the price of ads will fall further,” Levy predicted, referring to TV broadcasters, print outlets, and radio. Levy said Publicis had already won one contract with beauty products maker Coty with billings of $100 million and another with coffee specialist Keurig worth $150 million. “If we lose all our current contracts and win none of the new ones we’re going for then our sales could drop 2 percent,” said Levy. “But if we defend everything and win all the new ones, then they could go up as much as 3 percent.” Sorrell said that WPP’s plan was to stress its technology and data expertise in pitches to clients. WPP has made a big bet on data with its Kantar unit, which Sorrell argues offers a competitive advantage although a lower margin business. “We are differentiated from our competitors and that will help in the reviews,” he said.

444,PG,Coty buying P&G; beauty business for $12.5 billion,"(Reuters) - Coty Inc (COTY.N), the U.S. maker of Calvin Klein and Chloe perfume, will buy Procter & Gamble’s (PG.N) perfume, hair care and make-up businesses for $12.5 billion in the biggest cosmetics merger in recent history. Coty would become the No. 1 perfume maker ahead of L’Oreal (OREP.PA) and No. 3 make-up provider behind its French rival and Estee Lauder (EL.N). It would run the perfume licenses of Gucci, Hugo Boss and Dolce & Gabbana as well as make-up brands Cover Girl and Max Factor, more than doubling its size with combined sales of more than $10 billion. The deal comes as Coty’s sales across categories have either been stagnating or declining for more than two years while P&G; has been struggling to expand its beauty business. Coty shares fell 4.6 percent, while P&G; slipped 0.4 percent as investors questioned the benefits of the mega-merger.  “We are getting critical mass around the globe with access to key markets such as Brazil, Japan and Mexico,” Coty Chairman and Chief Executive Bart Becht said in an interview on Thursday. Analysts said the mass beauty brands Coty is set to acquire is expected to do well in emerging markets due to low pricing but the company has to invest in new initiatives to revive growth in developed markets. “The deal is extremely transformative for Coty, but investors are uncertain of what this means for the company,” retail research firm Conlumino’s Chief Executive Neil Saunders said. The debt Coty will assume, fairly small savings and questions on how it will cope with the transition make investors nervous, he said. Coty said the deal would save $550 million, including $400 million in non-transferred overhead costs, but take on $2.9 billion of P&G; Beauty’ debt. But Coty’s stock is still up about 17 percent from before Reuters’ June 8 report that it was fighting rivals such as Henkel for P&G;’s beauty business and had submitted a bid for the P&G; assets. The sale is part of P&G;’s plan to narrow its focus on fewer, faster-growing brands. The world’s No. 1 household products maker said last year it could sell about half of its slow-growing brands. The 43 brands being sold generated sales of $5.9 billion, or 7 percent of P&G;’s total revenue in fiscal 2013/14, and adjusted income of $1.15 billion. By taking on P&G;’s hair brands Wella and Clairol, Coty is entering a whole new business, which ranked No. 2 in terms of market share. On a call with analysts, P&G; said it prefers to execute the deal through a “Reverse Morris Trust” split off transaction in which its shareholders could exchange P&G; shares for those of Coty and the new beauty businesses. However, if it is executed as a split-merge, P&G; would establish a separate entity to hold these beauty brands which would be transferred to electing P&G; shareholders in a tax efficient transaction. There will also be a simultaneous merger of the new entity with Coty. P&G; said it expects to close the deal in the second half of calendar 2016 pending regulatory approvals. P&G; shareholders would own 52 percent of the combined business while Coty’s existing shareholders will own 48 percent. Coty shareholder JAB Holdings, the Luxemburg investment company of the billionaire German Reimann family, will own a third of the combined entity.   BECHT’S BETCoty has gone through a painful three-year reorganization with departures by many top executives and marketing veterans. Becht, who will be running the combined business, said Coty would take on all of P&G;’s Wella and Clairol management teams as Coty had no experience in that sector. The company expects hair color products to account for 24 percent of total sales after the deal was completed. P&G;’s 10,000 employees will join Coty’s 9,000, Becht said.       P&G;’s beauty chief Patrice Louvet will not be part of the new entity, Becht noted. P&G; refused to comment on specific management moves related to this deal. P&G; estimated a one-time gain of $5 billion to $7 billion,  depending on the value of the merger at closing. Goldman Sachs advised P&G;, while Morgan Stanley was lead adviser for Coty.

446,PG,US STOCKS-China relief fuels Wall St gains; Apple drops,"* Chinese regulator restricts sale of shares * Cautious optimism on Greece * Shares of Apple down for five straight sessions * Coty falls after agreeing to buy P&G;’s beauty business * Indexes close higher: Dow 0.19 pct, S&P; 0.23 pct, Nasdaq 0.26 pct   (Adds detail on volume) By Noel Randewich July 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Thursday after Wall Street found relief in Beijing’s efforts to halt a rout in Chinese stocks, which lifted markets around the world. Shares of Apple bucked the market and logged their first five-day losing streak since January as investors worried that consumers in China might have less money to spend on iPhones. Wall Street had fallen sharply in the previous session as market turmoil in China, a rout in commodity prices, the Greek debt crisis and a major outage on the New York Stock Exchange spooked investors. China’s securities regulator, in its most drastic step yet to arrest a selloff on Chinese stock markets, banned shareholders with large stakes in listed firms from selling for the next six months. About 30 percent has been knocked off the value of Chinese shares since mid-June. Some investors fear that the turmoil in the Chinese market could destabilize the global financial system, making it a bigger risk than the Greek crisis. Adding to cautious optimism on Wall Street, European markets rose on hopes that Greece might be able to win a deal that could keep it in the euro zone. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has until midnight to propose spending cut plans. “There a relief that (China’s selloff) didn’t continue. There’s a relief that there doesn’t seem to be any belligerent tone coming out of Greece,” said Steve Goldman, principal of Goldman Management in Short Hills, New Jersey. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.2 points, or 0.19 percent, to end at 17,548.62. The S&P; 500 gained 4.63 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,051.31 and the Nasdaq Composite added 12.64 points, or 0.26 percent, to 4,922.40. All three indexes earlier traded up 1 percent or more. “There was a bit more optimism this morning and then just a general fallback as the day went on,” said Giri Cherukuri, head trader at OakBrook Investments LLC, which oversees $1.3 billion in Lisle, Illinois. Seven of the 10 major S&P; 500 sectors were higher, with the financial index leading the gainers with a 0.77 percent rise. The NYSE, which accounted for about 13 percent of the volume of U.S. stocks traded last month, said Wednesday’s halt was due to a technical problem that stemmed from new software rolled out the previous evening. U.S. second-quarter earnings season is getting under way with major U.S. banks scheduled to report next week. Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance, the largest U.S. drug store chain, jumped 4.24 percent after the company raised its full-year profit forecast. Coty’s shares fell 4.7 percent after Procter & Gamble agreed to sell its beauty business to the company in a deal that values the business at $12.5 billion. P&G; shares dipped 0.41 percent. Apple dropped 2.04 percent to $120.07, just over a dollar above its 200-day moving average, closely watched by traders. On Friday, investors will look to a press conference by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen for new clues about when the central bank will begin to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006. A hike in interest rates increases the cost of borrowing, crimping corporate profit margins. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,773 to 1,284, for a 1.38-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,757 issues rose and 997 fell for a 1.76-to-1 ratio favoring advancers. The benchmark S&P; 500 index posted 9 new 52-week highs and 17 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 34 new highs and 84 new lows.

447,PG,US STOCKS-China relief fuels Wall St gains; Apple drops,"* Chinese regulator restricts sale of shares * Cautious optimism on Greece * Shares of Apple down for five straight sessions * Coty falls after agreeing to buy P&G;’s beauty business * Indexes close higher: Dow 0.19 pct, S&P; 0.23 pct, Nasdaq 0.26 pct   (Updates to afternoon trade, adds comment, detail on Apple) By Noel Randewich July 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Thursday after Wall Street found relief in Beijing’s efforts to halt a rout in Chinese stocks, which lifted markets around the world. Shares of Apple bucked the market and logged their first five-day losing streak since January as investors worried that consumers in China might have less money to spend on iPhones. Wall Street had fallen sharply in the previous session as market turmoil in China, a rout in commodity prices, the Greek debt crisis and a major outage on the New York Stock Exchange spooked investors. China’s securities regulator, in its most drastic step yet to arrest a selloff on Chinese stock markets, banned shareholders with large stakes in listed firms from selling for the next six months. About 30 percent has been knocked off the value of Chinese shares since mid-June. Some investors fear that the turmoil in the Chinese market could destabilize the global financial system, making it a bigger risk than the Greek crisis. Adding to cautious optimism on Wall Street, European markets rose on hopes that Greece might be able to win a deal that could keep it in the euro zone. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has until midnight to propose spending cut plans. “There a relief that (China’s selloff) didn’t continue. There’s a relief that there doesn’t seem to be any belligerent tone coming out of Greece,” said Steve Goldman, principal of Goldman Management in Short Hills, New Jersey. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.2 points, or 0.19 percent, to end at 17,548.62. The S&P; 500 gained 4.63 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,051.31 and the Nasdaq Composite added 12.64 points, or 0.26 percent, to 4,922.40. All three indexes earlier traded up 1 percent or more. “There was a bit more optimism this morning and then just a general fallback as the day went on,” said Giri Cherukuri, head trader at OakBrook Investments LLC, which oversees $1.3 billion in Lisle, Illinois. Seven of the 10 major S&P; 500 sectors were higher, with the financial index leading the gainers with a 0.77 percent rise. The NYSE, which accounted for about 13 percent of the volume of U.S. stocks traded last month, said Wednesday’s halt was due to a technical problem that stemmed from new software rolled out the previous evening. U.S. second-quarter earnings season is getting under way with major U.S. banks scheduled to report next week. Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance, the largest U.S. drug store chain, jumped 4.24 percent after the company raised its full-year profit forecast. Coty’s shares fell 4.7 percent after Procter & Gamble agreed to sell its beauty business to the company in a deal that values the business at $12.5 billion. P&G; shares dipped 0.41 percent. Apple dropped 2.04 percent to $120.07, just over a dollar above its 200-day moving average, closely watched by traders. On Friday, investors will look to a press conference by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen for new clues about when the central bank will begin to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006. A hike in interest rates increases the cost of borrowing, crimping corporate profit margins. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,773 to 1,284, for a 1.38-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,757 issues rose and 997 fell for a 1.76-to-1 ratio favoring advancers. The benchmark S&P; 500 index posted 9 new 52-week highs and 17 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 34 new highs and 84 new lows.

452,PG,UPDATE 2-P&G; to sell beauty business to Coty in $12.5 bln deal,"(Adds details, updates shares) By Siddharth Cavale July 9 (Reuters) - Coty Inc has sealed a deal to buy Procter & Gamble Co’s beauty business, which includes brands such as Clairol and Wella, in a $12.5 billion transaction that will make Coty the world leader in perfume and hair care. Coty’s shares fell 6 percent in early trading after the widely expected deal, while P&G; was up 0.6 percent. In a tax-efficient deal designed as a “Reverse Morris Trust” transaction, P&G; will separate 43 of its cosmetics, fragrance and haircare brands and fold them into Coty. The deal is a game-changer for Coty as it adds popular brands such as Wella and Clairol hair color products and Cover Girl and Max Factor make-up to its portfolio of perfume brands that include Marc Jacobs and Calvin Klein. Coty will also gain access to Gucci and Dolce & Gabbana perfumes as part of the deal. For P&G;, the sale is part of a plan to narrow its focus on fewer, faster-growing brands. The world’s No. 1 household products maker said last year it could sell about half of its slow-growing brands. The combined company is expected to have annual revenue of more than $10 billion - double Coty’s turnover - and will be led by Coty CEO Bart Becht. Coty, which is trying to staunch a decline in sales, said it expects hair color products to account for 24 percent of total sales after the deal is completed. Coty said it expects to generate about $4.5 billion in annual sales from its fragrance business, making it the world’s largest fragrance company by sales. It also expects to become the third largest brand in the color and cosmetics sector, behind L’Oreal and Estee Lauder. JAB Cosmetics B.V. owns 97 percent of Coty’s Class B shares is in favor of the deal, Coty said. JAB is controlled by Germany’s billionaire Reimann family. Coty said the deal valued the P&G; Beauty Business at $12.5 billion at the time of the proposal. Based on Coty’s current stock price, outstanding shares and equity grants, the value of the transaction is about $15 billion, P&G; said. P&G; estimated a one-time gain of $5 billion-$7 billion,  depending on the final deal value at the time of closing. Reuters first reported in June that Coty was on track to acquire P&G;’s brands in a $12 billion deal. Goldman Sachs advised P&G;, while Morgan Stanley was the lead adviser for Coty.

454,PG,Becht to lead Coty/P&G; beauty merger despite industry doubts,"PARIS (Reuters) - Coty Inc’s boss Bart Becht believes he is the right man to run what will become the world’s biggest perfume maker, despite industry doubts over its planned mega-merger and faltering sales at the beauty products group. With Coty due to gobble up Procter & Gamble’s beauty business for $12.5 billion, Becht has no intention of seeking anyone else to lead the expanded group where he is both chairman and chief executive following a series of high-level departures. “As you know, there has been a lot of changes at Coty over the past 12 to 18 months ... so the board asked me to stay to oversee the transaction,” Becht told Reuters after the P&G; deal was announced last week.  The 58-year-old Dutchman said it was possible the group, founded in Paris and New York-based, could hire a new leader in the future but there was no time frame for that now. Becht, who jointly runs a Luxembourg holding company that is Coty’s biggest shareholder, knows how to merge big businesses. He tied up Dutch-based Benckiser with Britain’s Reckitt & Colman in 1999 and ran the combined chemicals and consumer goods group for more than a decade. Under him, Reckitt Benckiser grew in value from 3 billion to 23.5 billion pounds, helped by two major acquisitions. Its shares rose more than four-fold over a decade. Coty, the maker of Calvin Klein and Chloe perfumes, has at times proved a tougher proposition since Becht became chairman in 2011 to prepare for a stock market flotation. After its New York debut in 2013, the share price stagnated and at times was significantly lower until late autumn last year. Still, Becht’s cuts to marketing departments and expenses in general lifted profits, and the stock eventually responded. It rose more than 60 percent in the eight months to June, when news broke that the P&G; deal was afoot. But since peaking at $32 in early July just before the merger was officially announced, it has lost 15 percent as the forecast earnings boost was smaller than expected and investors were concerned the deal would take more than a year to complete. While Becht is known in the industry for his cost-cutting abilities, he has a stronger record in managing fast-moving consumer goods such as Woolite soap than high-end perfumes. “Becht is a numbers man, an efficient operator and a great deal-maker but he is not a person with a particularly strong luxury sensitivity,” said one former senior Coty manager who worked with him for several years. Under Becht, who is personally Coty’s seventh biggest shareholder, the group has become one of the industry’s worst performers in terms of sales. These fell 2.1 percent in the year to June 30, 2014 while Estee Lauder’s revenue grew 8 percent in the same period and L’Oreal’s like-for-like sales rose 3.7 percent in calendar 2014. Becht has also made pay-offs to three chief executives - two who departed and one who never arrived. A week before frozen foods manager Elio Leoni Sceti was due to start on July 1, Becht told him not to come, allowing the Dutchman to handle the merger in both top jobs. Sceti got $1.75 million in compensation. Coty, which was once associated with the early 20th century inventor of modern perfumery Francois Coty, highlights the dangers of putting profits before creativity and innovation - a recipe for disaster in terms of sales growth. Some analysts say the future looks difficult. “Valuation could decline if Coty does not improve organic sales growth in the base business ... and CEO Bart Becht did not offer solid arguments why, and in what timeframe, this deal would enhance organic sales growth,” said Linda Bolton Weiser at broker B. Riley & Co.  Weiser, who kept a “sell” rating on Coty stock, cited uncertainty over how long Becht would stay and whether the company could eventually find a super-star to manage this “beauty beast” - the P&G; deal will double Coty’s size, creating a group with more than $10 billion in annual sales.  Coty, which makes Rimmel mascara, will run P&G;’s make-up brands Cover Girl and Max Factor as well as its perfume licenses with fashion brands Gucci, Hugo Boss and Dolce & Gabbana. It will also enter a new category with P&G;’s Wella and Clairol hair treatment brands. Many of Coty’s big perfume brands such as Calvin Klein have lost market share and quarterly revenue has either fallen or stagnated for more than two years. P&G;’s beauty businesses have performed little better. This year, sales of its fragrance brands are down and make-up brands flat, while its hair business is modestly growing, sources close to the deal said. Coty and P&G; declined to confirm the trends. Becht said the merger would not create growth overnight but would generate $550 million in savings and boost future profits and earnings per share - on which his long-term incentive plan is based. After waves of job losses, Coty employees fear further cuts once the deal goes through, according to people at the company. Restructuring has created a climate of fear “which is not very good for creativity”, said one person still at Coty. This worries analysts. “One of my concerns is how Coty will retain and attract talent,” said Mark Astrachan, analyst at broker Stifel. Bernd Beetz, who led Coty for 11 years, departed as CEO less than a year after Becht arrived. Beetz was known for empowering staff, making them take risks and come up with innovative marketing campaigns and products, former and current Coty managers said, declining to be named. “When Beetz left, the whole company was in mourning,” said a former top Coty executive who left for a rival firm. Beetz’s successor Michele Scannavini also left in September last year, putting Becht firmly in the executive seat. Recent casualties have included the chief marketing officer and fragrance marketing director. Renato Semerari, president of categories and innovation, quit Coty and now heads Italian fashion brand Roberto Cavalli. Becht acknowledges he focused too hard on short-term profits after the IPO. “Yes, I agree,” he told Reuters last month. “But we restored profitability by cutting non-strategic cost and now we have the flexibility to reinvest back into the business.” Last year Becht merged Coty’s mass and prestige divisions although they have different objectives: one to give consumers value for money, the other to sell a dream in a bottle.  Becht believes in the fast-moving consumer goods model which worked at Reckitt, involving high volumes, low cost and reasonable margins. This may not work for high-end cosmetics, analysts say, where shops are more carefully selected to protect image, limiting volumes. Also, marketing costs are higher but so are prices and margins. Coty does not fully exploit its heritage, unlike many other luxury brands. For example, Henri Coty, grandson of the company’s founder, failed to persuade Coty to re-launch historic perfumes such as L’Origan. Francois Coty, a descendant of Napoleon, was one of France’s richest men who owned Figaro newspaper and made his fortune in building fragrance factories, flower fields and collaborating with crystal bottle makers such as Baccarat and glass designer Rene Lalique.  Becht is one of three people who run JAB Holdings, the firm that manages the fortune of the German billionaire Reimann family, inherited from Benckiser. JAB owns 75 percent of Coty and will hold a third of the enlarged business, with P&G; shareholders taking 52 percent. “For me, part of the problem is that JAB has been meddling too much with Coty’s business,” said one of the merger’s many advisers.   JAB has a checkered history with creative types. Shortly after it bought Jimmy Choo in 2011, it parted ways with Tamara Mellon, who was the soul of its fashion success.  Several of JAB’s luxury brands are struggling. British jacket brand Belstaff has not stopped haemorrhaging cash since JAB bought the firm in 2011. When it will become profitable remains unclear, industry sources close to JAB said. Swiss leather goods brand Bally is just starting to turn itself around about eight years after being acquired by JAB.

455,PG,INSIGHT-Becht to lead Coty/P&G; beauty merger despite industry doubts,"* Coty to swallow up P&G; beauty business for $12.5 bln * Becht has good record on big mergers, cost-cutting * But Coty sales falter under his leadership * Ex-manager questions Becht’s feel for luxury market * Becht hasn’t explained how sales will grow -analyst By Astrid Wendlandt PARIS, July 16 (Reuters) - Coty Inc’s boss Bart Becht believes he is the right man to run what will become the world’s biggest perfume maker, despite industry doubts over its planned mega-merger and faltering sales at the beauty products group. With Coty due to gobble up Procter & Gamble’s beauty business for $12.5 billion, Becht has no intention of seeking anyone else to lead the expanded group where he is both chairman and chief executive following a series of high-level departures. “As you know, there has been a lot of changes at Coty over the past 12 to 18 months ... so the board asked me to stay to oversee the transaction,” Becht told Reuters after the P&G; deal was announced last week. The 58-year-old Dutchman said it was possible the group, founded in Paris and New York-based, could hire a new leader in the future but there was no time frame for that now. Becht, who jointly runs a Luxembourg holding company that is Coty’s biggest shareholder, knows how to merge big businesses. He tied up Dutch-based Benckiser with Britain’s Reckitt & Colman in 1999 and ran the combined chemicals and consumer goods group for more than a decade. Under him, Reckitt Benckiser grew in value from 3 billion to 23.5 billion pounds, helped by two major acquisitions. Its shares rose more than four-fold over a decade. Coty, the maker of Calvin Klein and Chloe perfumes, has at times proved a tougher proposition since Becht became chairman in 2011 to prepare for a stock market flotation. After its New York debut in 2013, the share price stagnated and at times was significantly lower until late autumn last year. Still, Becht’s cuts to marketing departments and expenses in general lifted profits, and the stock eventually responded. It rose more than 60 percent in the eight months to June, when news broke that the P&G; deal was afoot. But since peaking at $32 in early July just before the merger was officially announced, it has lost 15 percent as the forecast earnings boost was smaller than expected and investors were concerned the deal would take more than a year to complete. While Becht is known in the industry for his cost-cutting abilities, he has a stronger record in managing fast-moving consumer goods such as Woolite soap than high-end perfumes. “Becht is a numbers man, an efficient operator and a great deal-maker but he is not a person with a particularly strong luxury sensitivity,” said one former senior Coty manager who worked with him for several years.

462,PG,Venezuela currency blues hit U.S. blue-chip companies,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Venezuela’s currency woes cut nearly $3 billion in profit at U.S. blue-chip companies during the second quarter and prompted Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) to remove its operations in the South American country from its consolidated financial reports. More so-called deconsolidation moves and exits from Venezuela are likely to happen during the second half of the year as U.S. corporations grow increasingly frustrated with Venezuela’s sinking Bolivar currency, according to analysts and U.S. regulatory filings. Deconsolidating Venezuelan operations means that business can largely no longer hurt or benefit a U.S. parent company’s financial results. Often companies are taking a big one-time charge so that they can ring-fence what is left in Venezuela. Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co (GT.O), for example, said they also may deconsolidate their Venezuela operations if economic conditions in that country worsen, according to U.S. regulatory filings made this week. And Mattel Inc (MAT.O) said it may cease operations in Venezuela altogether if volatility in Venezuela worsens. With slumping crude oil prices and debt payments coming due this year, the Venezuelan government has fewer U.S. dollar reserves available to meet the private sector’s demands. As a result, entities may have a harder time obtaining U.S. dollars than any time since currency controls were first implemented in 2003, Ernst & Young said in an April report.   Jack Ciesielski, president of investment research firm R.G. Associates, said if conditions do not improve in Venezuela, he expects to see more companies follow P&G;’s lead.  “I’d say the die has been cast,” he said. Drug maker Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) took a $715 million second-quarter hit against profit after it revalued its Venezuela assets using a less preferential exchange rate.  But the biggest impact from Venezuela’s currency woes came from Procter & Gamble. The world’s largest consumer products maker on Thursday announced a $2.1 billion charge against earnings, reflecting the company’s inability to convert Venezuela’s currency or pay dividends.   Beginning in the third quarter, P&G; will exclude the operating results of its Venezuelan subsidiaries from its consolidated financial statements. Hits to U.S. corporate profits in Venezuela accelerated in February when the President Nicolas Maduro devalued the bolivar by 70 percent via a new currency system known as Simadi. Previously, many U.S. companies valued their monetary and non-monetary assets at the most preferred rate of 6.3 bolivars to the dollar. But under Simadi, the exchange rate has been around 200 bolivars.

464,PG,P&G; results raise concerns about pace of turnaround,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) reported its sixth straight quarter of falling sales, hurt mainly by the stronger dollar. Even after stripping out the impact of the dollar and acquisitions, sales rose just 1 percent, raising concerns about the slow pace at which P&G; is turning around its business. The company’s shares fell as much as 4.3 percent in morning trading on Thursday, after it said sales would fall by a low-to-mid single-digit percentage in the year ending June 2016. P&G;, struggling in an increasingly competitive consumer products industry, has been trying to turn itself around since 2014 by focusing on fewer, faster-growing brands. It has also made management changes, including appointing company veteran David Taylor CEO this week. But these moves have failed to convince investors that the company, which gets two-thirds of its revenue from outside the United States, has done enough to get back on track. JP Morgan analysts noted that P&G;’s volume sales were the weakest in five years. Some analysts question whether P&G; is too big and whether it would be better off splitting its businesses into separate companies. Analysts on a conference call grilled executives about why P&G; was still struggling to show underlying earnings growth, why steps taken so far have been ineffective and whether the company had a Plan B. “We clearly recognize the need to grow faster ... we’re not going to get there in the next quarter or two but we do expect sequential progress as we move through the next fiscal year,” Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said. Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said P&G; should break into three companies — beauty, grooming and health, and home care. P&G; has dropped about 50 brands since 2014, of which 43 were sold to perfume maker Coty Inc (COTY.N) for $12.5 billion this month. P&G; intends to retain a core portfolio of 65 brands, including Tide detergent, Pampers diapers and Gillette shaving products. Neil Saunders, CEO of research firm Conlumino, said P&G; needs to get rid of more brands if it wants to turn itself around faster. Net income attributable to P&G; fell 80 percent to $521 million, or 18 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended June 30, mainly due to a $2.03 billion one-time charge related to its Venezuelan operations. Revenue fell 9.2 percent to $17.79 billion. ",7302015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-procter-gamble-results/pg-results-raise-concerns-about-pace-of-turnaround-idUSKCN0Q41D520150730

Procter & Gamble, Facebook and Whole Foods Market all fell after quarterly reports that left investors wanting more. U.S. economic growth accelerated in the June quarter as solid consumer spending offset a drag from weak business spending on equipment, suggesting steady momentum that could bring the Federal Reserve closer to hiking interest rates this year. With a mixed bag of corporate earnings over halfway through second-quarter reporting season and a sharp focus on when the Federal Reserve will begin raising interest rates from nearly zero, investors on Thursday saw few reasons to pay more for shares. “We’ve been stuck in a 3-percent band since almost the beginning of the year,” said Warren West, principal at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia. “There’s nothing motivating investors to push it outside of that in either direction.” At 2:25 pm, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.08 percent at 17,736.66. The S&P; 500 was 0.07 percent lower at 2,107.09 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.34 percent at 5,129.30. Five of the 10 major S&P; sectors were lower with the energy index’s 0.95 percent fall leading the decliners and a 0.66 percent rise in the utilities index leading gainers. With 64 percent of S&P; 500 companies having reported second-quarter results, analysts expect overall earnings to edge up 1 percent and revenue to decline 3.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Valuations remain a concern. The S&P; 500 is trading near 16.8 times forward 12-month earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data. Companies scheduled to report during the day include Expedia , LinkedIn and Western Union after the close. Skechers USA jumped 15.6 percent as the sports shoe maker and retailer reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly revenue. Procter & Gamble fell 3.9 percent, Facebook dropped 1.6 percent and Whole Foods slumped 12.4 percent. Declining issues edged advancing ones on the NYSE by 1.10 to 1. On the Nasdaq, gainers outnumbered losers by 1.02 to 1. The S&P; 500 was posting 32 new 52-week highs and 6 lows; the Nasdaq was recording 60 new highs and 71 lows.

The group said Armani, thanks to its “Si” and “Acqua di Gio” perfumes, and Yves Saint Laurent, boosted by the success of “Black Opium” perfume and make-up, recorded double-digit first-half growth while its professional hair products unit saw a rebound, helped by its L’Oreal Professionel and Redken brands. “We believe that the market will be comforted by the improvement in the two developed regions,” UBS said in a note, referring to the United States and Western Europe. L’Oreal’s like-for-like 3.6 percent sales growth year-on-year in the second quarter undershot market expectations of 4 percent. But Chief Executive Jean-Paul Agon told Le Figaro newspaper the miss was mainly due to business deteriorating in Brazil and without that country, sales growth would have been 4 percent. “The bad news this year comes from Brazil and it is there to stay because the crisis is structural,” Agon told the French daily. Agon predicted sales growth of the global cosmetics market would be 3.5-4 percent in 2015, of the same order as last year and with which L’Oreal’s underlying sales growth was in line. “But it (the group’s sales growth) will be higher in the second half thanks to the expected pick-up at our mass market division and which will continue in 2016,” Agon told Le Figaro. Agon told the paper that online sales, up 40 percent in the first half, now represented around 4-5 percent of L’Oreal’s total revenue. “E-commerce is a an activity with good profitability, with low costs,” Agon said. Agon declined to say if L’Oreal would try to lure Gucci’s perfume licence from Coty, which just acquired it from Procter & Gamble as part of a $12.5 billion deal. “This is great news,” Agon told the paper about the transaction. “It means that P&G; abandoned its ambition, set 15 years ago, of becoming a world leader in the beauty market.” L’Oreal, which makes Lancome cream and Garnier shampoo, achieved operating profit of 2.32 billion euros ($2.53 billion) in the first half, broadly in line with the average estimate in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll of 2.31 billion.

472,PG,WRAPUP 2-U.S. factory orders rebound on strong demand for aircraft,"(Updates with economists raising Q2 growth estimates) * Factory orders increase 1.8 percent in June * Gain in core capital goods orders lowered to 0.7 percent * Shipments of core capital goods revised to show increase By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - New orders for U.S. factory goods rebounded strongly in June on robust demand for transportation equipment and other goods, a hopeful sign for the struggling manufacturing sector. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday new orders for manufactured goods increased 1.8 percent after declining 1.1 percent in May. “We are moving past the very weak period for the manufacturing sector from early on this year, but that activity has yet to meaningfully increase,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. Factory activity has been stymied by a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector after last year’s sharp plunge in crude oil prices. Tepid global demand also has weighed on manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the domestic economy. Those factors have eroded the profits of multinational companies like Caterpillar Inc, Procter & Gamble Co , the world’s largest household products maker, and Whirlpool Corp, the global home appliances giant. Though there are signs that the energy spending drag is easing, the dollar’s strength will likely remain a constraint. The dollar has gained 15 percent against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners since June 2014. Stocks on Wall Street were little changed, while prices for U.S. government debt fell. The dollar was largely flat against a basket of currencies. Orders for transportation equipment surged 9.3 percent in June, reflecting a 65.4 percent jump in aircraft bookings. There were increases in orders for machinery, furniture, fabricated metal products, electrical equipment, appliances and components. The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - increased 0.7 percent instead of the 0.9 percent rise reported last month. Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 0.3 percent in June. Shipments were previously reported to have dipped 0.1 percent. Manufacturing inventories increased a solid 0.6 percent, which was more than the government assumed in its second-quarter GDP snapshot published last week. Coming on the heels of a report on Monday showing stronger construction spending in May and April than previously reported, economists said the sturdy increase in factory inventories suggested that second-quarter GDP could be revised to as high as a 3 percent annual pace. The Commerce Department reported last Thursday that the economy expanded at a 2.3 percent pace in the second quarter. It will publish its second GDP estimate for that quarter later this month. In the wake of the construction data, economists had said they expected second-quarter growth would be raised by at least four-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.7 percent pace. They forecast factory inventories adding another 0.3 percentage point. But with the inventories-to-shipments ratio at a lofty 1.35, compared to 1.30 last September, manufacturers might be sitting on a pile of unwanted goods, which could hurt production and weigh on growth in the coming quarters. “It also highlights the probability that an unwinding of this stockpiling will almost assuredly result in a drag on GDP growth in the second half of the year,” Tim Quinlin, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

473,PG,UPDATE 5-Buffett pays high price for Precision Castparts,"(Adds comments, details on valuation, updates share prices) By Jonathan Stempel, Sagarika Jaisinghani and Sweta Singh Aug 10 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett is paying a hefty price for the biggest bet of his career as his Berkshire Hathaway Inc  has agreed to buy Precision Castparts Corp, valuing the maker of aerospace and other parts at $32.3 billion. The purchase is Berkshire’s largest, and accelerates its transformation from a company largely dependent on insurance businesses into one resembling the broader U.S. economy, including a railroad, several industrial companies, utilities, a car dealership and consumer goods businesses. It also joins several recent Buffett forays into unglamorous sectors, including a big stake Kraft Heinz Co and the pending takeover of the Duracell battery business from Procter & Gamble Co. Berkshire has said it owned 3 percent of Precision Castparts prior to Monday’s takeover. Precision Castparts earned $1.53 billion in its latest fiscal year. “I’m not crazy about paying $30 billion for a $1.5 billion earnings stream of a cyclical company supplying airplane makers,” said Jeff Matthews, a principal at hedge fund Ram Partners and author of a book about Buffett. “I’d keep the $30 billion and wait for the next crisis.” Known for buying undervalued and often unloved companies, Buffett acknowledged paying a steep price for Precision Castparts, which has been hurt by falling oil and gas prices. “This is a very high multiple for us to pay,” he told CNBC television. Berkshire is paying $235 per share for Precision Castparts, which represents a 21.2 percent premium over Friday’s closing price, and 17.5 times projected 12-month profit. It valued Precision Castparts at $37.2 billion including debt. The merger eclipses Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire’s $26.5 billion purchase in 2010 of the 77.4 percent of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad that it did not already own. In afternoon trading, Precision Castparts shares rose $37.13, or 19.2 percent, to $231.01. Berkshire’s Class A shares fell $522.76, or 0.2 percent, to $214,940. The latest purchase shows how hard it is to move the needle at Berkshire, whose own stock has lagged the Standard & Poor’s 500 in the last five years and which on Friday posted quarterly operating profit well below analyst forecasts. Adding Precision Castparts would boost Berkshire’s overall operating profit by less than 10 percent. It would also give Berkshire ownership of 10 companies that standing alone could be part of the Fortune 500, plus 26.9 percent of Kraft Heinz. Todd Combs, one of Buffett’s investment managers, had begun buying Precision Castparts shares in 2012. “You’ve got to give credit to Todd Combs for this deal,” said Buffett, who turns 85 on August 30. Buffett has run Berkshire since 1965. Precision Castparts generates 70 percent of sales by making nuts, bolts and other fittings for the aerospace industry, where booming commercial aircraft demand has led Airbus Group SE  and Boeing Co to boost production. But the Portland, Oregon-based company also makes parts for the energy industry, which has struggled as oil prices   have fallen by more than half over the last year. Prior to Monday, Precision Castparts’ shares had fallen 20 percent in 2015, and the purchase price is below the shares’ 52-week high of $249.05 set last September. Even so, analysts said Berkshire is paying more than 12 times trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That’s above the 9 multiple for BNSF, which now generates more than one-fifth of Berkshire’s operating profit. “At the time of his Burlington Northern deal, everyone criticized he paid too high a price,” said Ken Shubin Stein, founder of Spencer Capital Management in New York. Precision Castparts would become a unit of Berkshire, keeping its name and management as well as its headquarters. “We see a unique alignment between Warren’s management and investment philosophy and how we manage PCC for the long term,” Chief Executive Mark Donegan said in a statement. Andrew Carolus, managing director at Mesirow Financial Investment Banking in Chicago, said Buffett is “obviously a believer” in Precision Castparts’ prospects “over the next five to six decades.” Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at New Albion Partners in New York, added that having access to Berkshire’s balance sheet could help Precision Castparts do more dealmaking, “which the management has proven they’re good at.” Other industrial companies that Buffett has bought in the last decade include toolmaker Iscar, parts maker Marmon, and specialty chemicals company Lubrizol. Buffett said Berkshire would spend $23 billion of cash to finance the Precision Castparts purchase, and borrow the rest. While that would leave Berkshire with more than $40 billion of cash, twice the cushion Buffett wants, Buffett said it would be at least a year before he could pursue another “elephant” sized transaction. Kraft Heinz has proven among his most successful. Buffett has in two years transformed what he has called a $9.5 billion investment in the former H.J. Heinz Co into a Kraft Heinz stake worth roughly $25.5 billion. The Castparts merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. Credit Suisse and the law firms Cravath, Swaine & Moore and Stoel Rives advised Precision Castparts. The law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson advised Berkshire.

474,PG,UPDATE 2-Russia asks retailers to withdraw some batches of foreign detergents,"(Adds details, Rospotrebnadzor and P&G; responses) By Maria Kiselyova Aug 25 (Reuters) - Russia’s consumer safety watchdog Rospotrebnadzor said it had asked retailers to withdraw some batches of detergents made by foreign companies including Henkel & Co and Procter & Gamble as they did not meet toxicological safety criteria. German retailer Metro AG said on Tuesday that its cash-and-carry stores in Russia had removed some cleaning and cosmetic products from their shelves on Rospotrebnadzor’s orders. Russia banned many food imports from the European Union and the United States last year in retaliation to their sanctions over Moscow’s role in the Ukraine conflict. Russia expanded the list of countries this year and restricted flower imports from the Netherlands, citing health risks. The extent of the withdrawal of foreign detergents, including those made by Colgate-Palmolive and Clorox Co , was not immediately clear. Russian media said only some products were affected rather than entire product lines. Rospotrebnadzor said on Tuesday that it was conducting tests on household chemicals and detergents made by other companies, but it did not elaborate. The watchdog is carrying out an unscheduled inspection of Henkel’s plant in Russia after reaching an agreement with the prosecutor general’s office, an official at Rospotrebnadzor’s Perm branch told Reuters. The results are expected in four days at the earliest, the official said. Henkel’s spokeswoman Natalia Ovakimian said the company was aware of the inspections, which were linked to the regulator’s earlier order to withdraw some of its detergent products from retail chains. Clorox spokeswoman Aileen Zerrudo said the company did not “actively market cleaning products in Russia,” but might have sold a “small amount of products” to a distributor. “In countries where we don’t operate but have permitted distribution of our products, we work with distributors to ensure regulations are met,” she said, adding that Clorox would conduct a “thorough assessment of this matter.” P&G; said it was seeking to work with the Rospotrebnadzor to resolve the matter as soon as possible. Russia’s home care market is valued at 188.54 billion rubles ($2.74 billion), according to Euromonitor. P&G; has a 27.4 percent share of the market, with Henkel holding 16.3 percent.

475,PG,P&G; sees organic sales growth from current quarter,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and said it expected organic sales to grow from the current quarter as it moves through a “portfolio cleanup.”  The company has been shrinking the number of its brands to focus on more profitable lines such as Gillette shaving products, Pampers diapers and Tide detergent.   Shares of P&G;, which sold 43 brands to Coty Inc (COTY.N) in July, rose as much as 4.8 percent on Friday.  P&G; expects organic sales growth “to further strengthen in the back half,” Chief Executive A.G. Lafley said. Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said pricing was expected to be a “bigger driver” of sales this year.  Some analysts, however, said the company needed to “decentralize” its operations to move faster on trends in emerging markets such as China.  “The more strong people they have with a local understanding of running their business, the better chances they have of not being late with their innovation and marketing strategy,” CLSA analyst Caroline Levy said.  “They’ve missed huge trends,” Levy said, notably a move to online shopping and the launch of new diaper products in China.  P&G;, which gets nearly two-thirds of its revenue from markets outside North America, reported its seventh straight quarter of sales decline as demand fell further across product categories and a strong dollar eroded international sales. Organic sales, which exclude the impact of currency, divestitures and acquisitions, fell 1 percent in the first quarter.

476,PG,UPDATE 3-P&G; sees organic sales growth from current quarter,"* 1st-quarter organic sales down 1 pct * P&G; needs to “decentralize” operations - analysts * Profit $0.98/shr vs est. $0.95 * Shares rise as much as 4.8 pct   (Adds analysts’ comments, details; updates shares) By Yashaswini Swamynathan Oct 23 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and said it expected organic sales to grow from the current quarter as it moves through a “portfolio cleanup.” The company has been shrinking the number of its brands to focus on more profitable lines such as Gillette shaving products, Pampers diapers and Tide detergent. Shares of P&G;, which sold 43 brands to Coty Inc in July, rose as much as 4.8 percent on Friday. P&G; expects organic sales growth “to further strengthen in the back half,” Chief Executive A.G. Lafley said. Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said pricing was expected to be a “bigger driver” of sales this year. Some analysts, however, said the company needed to “decentralize” its operations to move faster on trends in emerging markets such as China. “The more strong people they have with a local understanding of running their business, the better chances they have of not being late with their innovation and marketing strategy,” CLSA analyst Caroline Levy said. “They’ve missed huge trends,” Levy said, notably a move to online shopping and the launch of new diaper products in China. P&G;, which gets nearly two-thirds of its revenue from markets outside North America, reported its seventh straight quarter of sales decline as demand fell further across product categories and a strong dollar eroded international sales. Organic sales, which exclude the impact of currency, divestitures and acquisitions, fell 1 percent in the first quarter. RBC Capital markets analyst Nik Modi also expressed concerns over P&G;’s margin expansion and a fall in volumes, which he said suggested that the company was not spending enough to attract customers at a time when rivals were gaining market share.

477,PG,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-P&G; posts biggest sales drop in 7 quarters,"(Corrects paragraph 5 to say first quarter, not third quarter) Oct 23 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co reported its biggest drop in quarterly sales in seven quarters, hurt by weak demand across product categories and a strong dollar. The company also cut its full-year revenue growth forecast, saying it now expected the strong dollar to have a bigger impact of 5-6 percentage points than the 4-5 percentage points anticipated earlier. P&G; shares fell about 1 percent to $74.02 in premarket trading on Friday. P&G; has been focusing on more profitable brands including Gillette shaving products, Pampers diapers and Tide detergent, as it loses customers to companies such as Unilever Plc  and Colgate-Palmolive Co and local rivals in markets outside North America. Sales in all of P&G;’s product categories fell in double-digit percentage terms in the first quarter, with beauty, baby care and grooming products recording the worst drop. P&G;, which gets nearly two-thirds of its revenue from markets outside North America, was also hurt by a nearly 13 percent rise in the dollar against a basket of major currencies in the past year. The net income attributable to P&G; rose to $2.60 billion, or 91 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $1.99 billion, or 69 cents per share, a year earlier. Net sales fell 12 percent to $16.53 billion. Excluding the impact of currency, divestitures and acquisitions, sales fell 1 percent. Excluding items, the company earned 98 cents per share.

Coty, whose core perfume business is struggling due to increased competition, has been on an acquisition spree as it looks to transform itself into a global beauty products giant. It is buying 43 brands from Procter & Gamble Co for $12.5 billion, a deal that will make it the world’s No. 3 make-up manufacturer, behind L’Oreal SA and Estee Lauder Cos Inc. The company also said last week it would acquire the cosmetics unit of Brazil’s Hypermarcas SA to beef up distribution of the brands it will buy from Procter & Gamble in Brazil. Coty’s perfumes, sold mostly at retailers such as Wal-Mart , are losing their appeal as they are available widely. Consumers are also seeking out more niche perfumes rather than the company’s celebrity-branded perfumes. Coty said on Thursday it was on track to close its P&G; deal in the second half of 2016 and that the financing structure for the deal was in place. Sales from perfumes fell 8 percent, while those from skin & body care fell 1 percent in the first quarter, on a comparable basis, which excludes special items such as foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions. Net income attributable to Coty rose to $125.7 million, or 34 cents per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $10.6 million, or 3 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 59 cents per share. Net revenue on a comparable basis fell 2 percent to $1.11 billion. On a reported basis, they fell 8 percent. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 30 cents per share and revenue of $1.13 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Coty’s shares were down slightly in premarket trading on Thursday. The stock, which has risen 45 percent this year, closed at $29.95 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

485,PG,"WRAPUP 2-U.S. labor market strengthening, factories struggling","(Adds manufacturing data, analyst comments, updates markets) * Weekly jobless claims decline 11,000 * Mid-Atlantic factory activity contracts in December * Current account deficit increases 11.7 percent in Q3 By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week fell from a five-month high, suggesting sustained labor market healing that could lead to further Federal Reserve interest rate hikes next year. The sign of underlying economic strength came a day after the U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to between 0.25 percent and 0.50 percent, the first increase in nearly a decade. “The labor market continues to stay tight with demand for workers strong and pockets of actual shortages in many industries. The Fed has achieved the employment part of its dual mandate and this is what triggered the rates liftoff yesterday,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 271,000 for the week ended Dec. 12, the Labor Department said on Thursday. It was the 41st straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with strong labor market conditions. That is the longest such run since the early 1970s. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it strips out week-to-week volatility, slipped 250 to 270,500 last week. The Fed said in its policy statement on Wednesday that there had been “further improvement” in the labor market and that “underutilization of labor resources” had diminished appreciably since the beginning of the year. Despite the labor market momentum, there remains no respite for the manufacturing sector, which has been slammed by a robust dollar, deep spending cuts by energy firms, weak global demand and efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory glut. A separate report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed its gauge of manufacturing activity in the region fell to -5.9 this month from 1.9 in November. It was the third negative reading in the past four months. Factories in the mid-Atlantic region reported that new orders continued to decline this month, though there was an increase in shipments. Order books shrunk, while inventories  increased for the first time in four months. “The intense headwinds facing the U.S. manufacturing sector  continue to linger,” said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. A survey early this month showed manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy, contracted in November for the first time in three years. The weak Philadelphia Fed survey brought it in line with other regional surveys that have been mired in contractionary territory. U.S. stocks fell, while the dollar jumped to a fresh two-week high against a basket of currencies. U.S. government debt prices rose. The claims data covered the survey period for December nonfarm payrolls. The four-week average of claims dipped 500 between the November and December survey periods, suggesting another strong month of job gains. Payrolls increased by 211,000 in November. “We expect a 200,000 December nonfarm payroll increase, with limited upside risk from a tight claims path,” said Michael Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colorado. Dollar strength, which has eroded exports and the profits of multinational corporations, helped to push the current account deficit in the third quarter to its highest level in nearly seven years, another report from the Commerce Department showed. The current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, increased 11.7 percent to $124.1 billion, the largest shortfall since the fourth quarter of 2008. The current account was also pressured by an increase in remittances, government grants and pensions, and dividend payments to foreign individuals and entities. The deficit represented 2.7 percent of gross domestic product, the biggest share since the second quarter of 2012, up from 2.5 percent in the second quarter. The current account shortfall, however, is not a problem as the United States continues to attract ample income from overseas. “With rates of return in foreign economies likely to remain depressed for the foreseeable future, we look for the dollar to strengthen further in the coming quarters,” said Jay Bryson, global economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina.

488,PG,U.S. companies likely to take further big hits from Venezuela economic turmoil,"BOSTON (Reuters) - A slew of major  U.S. corporations are likely to announce in the next few weeks whether they will take big writedowns for their troubled Venezuela operations, and some may say they are leaving the country altogether.  The companies may decide to slash the valuations of their businesses and take charges based on declines in some of the  oil producing nation’s four exchange rates for the bolivar currency, of which three are official and one black market, and then deconsolidate the operations on their balance sheets, Wall Street securities analysts said. They may have more reason to accelerate the process after the socialist government on Friday declared a 60-day economic emergency, which would give President Nicolas Maduro wider powers to intervene in companies or limit access to already scarce dollars in Venezuela. It also disclosed that the nation’s economy contracted by 4.5 percent in the first nine months of last year while the official annual inflation rate was the world’s highest at 141.5 percent in that period, as plunging oil prices, and what critics of Maduro see as policy missteps, took an increasing toll.     Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.     The Reuters analysis shows that U.S. companies with exposure could face total writedowns of more than $3 billion if they revalue their assets in Venezuela using the less preferential Simadi exchange rate of nearly 200 bolivars to the dollar. In the past, many companies valued their assets using the main official rate of 6.3 bolivars per dollar.      But even that change may not reveal the full extent of the problem given that the black market exchange rate has worsened to about 878 bolivars to the dollar from about 190 bolivars a year ago, according to dolartoday.com, a website that tracks the rate.         MONITORING DAY-BY-DAY     Increased government regulations and lack of access to U.S. dollars at lower rates could force companies such as Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co to deconsolidate if they lose further control over their operations.  Goodyear said in recent financial disclosures that a deconsolidation move would trigger a one-time, pre-tax charge of more than $500 million and what it termed “derecognition” of $293 million of cash on its balance sheet. Goodyear was not immediately available for comment. At a Jan. 12 investor conference, Goodyear Chief Financial Officer Laura Thompson described Venezuela as “a very volatile environment.” “The outlook is pretty uncertain. Our visibility is unclear, but we continue to monitor the situation day-by-day, quarter-by-quarter, as we go,” Thompson said. Deconsolidation under U.S. accounting rules allow companies to treat a subsidiary in a volatile foreign market as an investment rather than an operating unit, while writing down the market value of that subsidiary largely insulates the parent company from future hits to its financial results. So far, blue-chip companies that have deconsolidated in Venezuela and written off nearly all of their investment there include Procter & Gamble Co, Pepsico Inc and Ford Motor Co. Among those who have departed altogether is cleaning products maker Clorox Co. One major pressure point could be drug companies. Abbott Laboratories, Abbvie Inc, Merck & Co Inc, Pfizer Inc and Zoetis Inc have about $1.8 billion in combined net monetary assets exposed to the bolivar, recent U.S. regulatory filings show. Zoetis, which declined to comment for this story, began scaling back operations in Venezuela several months ago, executives have said previously. Pfizer, Merck and Abbvie did not return messages seeking comment. Abbott declined to comment. These companies’ preferential access to dollars at the official exchange rate has become more difficult, even as the government has made availability of drugs a priority. But the economic crisis has worsened so much that now less business is being done at the official rate, even for essential food and medicine. The government also has another lower official rate known as the Sicad rate – that has been at around 13 bolivars to the dollar – but there are also very few dollars available at that rate. The last Sicad auction was in September.    Meanwhile, it is not uncommon for U.S. companies to have currency exchange settlements pending with the Venezuelan government for years, U.S. regulatory filings show. Other companies selling sensitive products, such as baby formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition Co, have had to adjust their practices because of constraints placed by the Venezuelan government on the release of U.S. dollars to repatriate cash back to the United States. Mead suspended shipments to Venezuela temporarily, the company said during an October investor day presentation. The company was not available for comment. Consumer products maker Newell Rubbermaid Inc has been identified by some Wall Street analysts as the next major U.S. company that will likely take action to protect itself from Venezuela’s crumbling economy. “We continue to view a deconsolidation (in Venezuela) as a likely event” when Newell reports fourth-quarter results on Jan 29, analysts at Jefferies Companies said last week in a research note. If Newell were to deconsolidate it would take a one-time charge of $111 million, according to company commentary in recent U.S. regulatory filings. Newell declined to comment for this story. Such a move would largely protect the company from taking further Venezuela-related hits to its financial results in the future. Among U.S. companies, Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate maker Mondelez International Inc has one of the largest remaining exposures to Venezuela, with $617 million in net assets, according to the Reuters analysis of corporate disclosures. “We would expect to provide an update on Venezuela and other markets when we announce our (fourth quarter) earnings on Feb. 3, but I’m not able to provide comment before that time due to quiet period,” said Mondelez spokeswoman Valerie Moens. Besides Newell and Goodyear, 3M Co, Colgate Palmolive Co and Herbalife Ltd have at least raised the specter of insulating their financial results from Venezuela. In U.S. regulatory filings over the past three months, the companies have talked about deconsolidation if conditions in Venezuela continue to deteriorate.      Toy maker Mattel Inc has said it may consider ceasing operations in Venezuela.

Such a move would largely protect the company from taking further Venezuela-related hits to its financial results in the future. Among U.S. companies, Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate maker Mondelez International Inc has one of the largest remaining exposures to Venezuela, with $617 million in net assets, according to the Reuters analysis of corporate disclosures. “We would expect to provide an update on Venezuela and other markets when we announce our (fourth quarter) earnings on Feb. 3, but I’m not able to provide comment before that time due to quiet period,” said Mondelez spokeswoman Valerie Moens. Besides Newell and Goodyear, 3M Co, Colgate Palmolive Co and Herbalife Ltd have at least raised the specter of insulating their financial results from Venezuela. In U.S. regulatory filings over the past three months, the companies have talked about deconsolidation if conditions in Venezuela continue to deteriorate.      Toy maker Mattel Inc has said it may consider ceasing operations in Venezuela.

491,PG,P&G; core sales return to growth due to price hikes,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co’s (PG.N) new chief executive is off to a “nice start” as the company’s core sales returned to growth in the second quarter, helped by price hikes and as it shed underperforming brands. Organic sales - core sales that exclude the impact of currency, divestitures and acquisitions - rose 2 percent in the quarter. These sales had dropped 1 percent in the previous quarter, marking its first decline since 2008. P&G; has been raising prices more rapidly to offset the stronger dollar’s impact. The price hikes helped it boost organic sales in the latest quarter, but led to a drop in volumes across all businesses. P&G; also posted a better-than-expected profit by cutting costs, sending its shares up 2.5 percent to $78.79 on Tuesday, outperforming the broader consumer staples index .SPLRCS. “Today’s results, along with increased visibility of the new CEO David Taylor, could move the stock into the $80s in the coming months,” SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst William Chappell wrote in a note titled, ‘Two percent organic growth a “nice start” for new CEO’. Taylor took the helm in November, in the middle of P&G;’s turnaround plan. P&G; is selling unprofitable brands and focusing on core brands such as Gillette, Pampers and Tide to revive sluggish growth, which analysts have blamed on the company’s slow reaction to trends in top markets such as China. Taylor has the ability to correct the company’s missteps, RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi said. P&G; now expects to reduce non-manufacturing costs by 25-30 percent by 2016, a year ahead of schedule, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a conference call. Moeller said P&G; would continue investing despite the strong dollar and expects media spend to increase in double-digits in the second half of 2016. The company, which gets nearly two-thirds of sales from outside North America, also said it would reduce its focus on unprofitable brands in India in favor of higher-margin products. P&G; said the strong dollar reduced second-quarter sales by 9 percent and in 2016 expects it to reduce sales by 7 percentage points, more than the 5-6 percentage points it estimated earlier. Overall, full-year sales are still expected to decline in the high-single digits. P&G;’s second-quarter sales fell 8.5 percent to $16.92 billion, slightly below analysts average estimate.  Excluding items, it earned $1.04 per share, beating estimates by 6 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

492,PG,US STOCKS-Oil fuels 'schizophrenic' rebound on Wall Street,"(Reuters) - Wall Street rebounded over 1 percent on Tuesday, driven by a surge in oil prices and strong quarterly results from 3M, Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble. All 10 major S&P; sectors ended higher, led by a 3.78-percent rise in the energy sector .SPNY. Crude prices settled up 3.7 percent on hopes that OPEC and non-OPEC producers would tackle an unrelenting supply glut. With oil at 12-year lows and threatening to put higher-cost producers out of business, investors have been reeling from a turbulent start to the year that has left the S&P; down 7 percent from the end of 2015.  “This is a schizophrenic market. Big up days, big down days. No real direction,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. “We need some stability in oil prices for the markets to calm down from here and become less volatile.”  Laser-focused on Tuesday’s rebound in crude prices, Wall Street shrugged off a 6 percent slump overnight in Chinese shares, sparked by jitters over Beijing’s ability to calm domestic markets. That left the gap between U.S. and Chinese stock indexes at its widest since at least August. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI ended 1.78 percent higher at 16,167.23 points and the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 1.41 percent to 1,903.63.  The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 1.09 percent to 4,567.67. While the U.S. Federal Reserve is not expected to move on interest rates at its two-day meeting, which began on Tuesday, investors will parse the Fed’s commentary to gauge how recent global turmoil affects the likelihood of future rate hikes. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) was the biggest influence on the S&P;, up 4.96 percent, while Procter & Gamble (PG.N) rose 2.55 percent. Both companies reported profits that beat estimates. Exxon (XOM.N) climbed 3.68 percent, while Chevron (CVX.N) rose 3.99 percent. 3M (MMM.N) jumped 5.24 percent, giving the biggest boost to the Dow, after better-than-expected quarterly profit.  Overall profit expectations remain weak, largely because of oil. Earnings of S&P; 500 companies on average are expected to fall 4.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Excluding energy, earnings are expected to grow 1.1 percent. About 7.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 8.2 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,591 to 507. On the Nasdaq, 2,010 issues rose and 809 fell. The S&P; 500 index showed three new 52-week highs and seven new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded eight new highs and 75 lows.

That left the gap between U.S. and Chinese stock indexes at its widest since at least August. Shares of Apple, which is scheduled to report results after the close, were up 0.6 percent. The iPhone maker’s comments on its China business will be in focus because of wide concerns about a potential slowdown in demand. At 2:48 pm, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 245.95 points to 16,131.17 and the S&P; 500 gained 21.43 points to 1,898.51. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.89 percent to 4,558.63.

501,PG,EU clears Coty acquisition of P&G; beauty businesses,"BRUSSELS, Feb 16 (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Tuesday it had approved Coty Inc’s planned acquisition of Procter & Gamble’s beauty products businesses by Coty after concluding the market competition would remain sufficiently strong. Coty, the U.S. maker of Calvin Klein and Chloe perfume, will buy Procter & Gamble’s perfume, hair care and make-up businesses for $12.5 billion in the biggest cosmetics merger in recent history. Coty would become the No. 1 perfume maker ahead of L’Oreal  and No. 3 make-up provider behind its French rival and Estee Lauder. It would run the perfume licenses of Gucci and Hugo Boss as well as make-up brands such as Max Factor, more than doubling its size with combined sales of more than $10 billion. The Commission said that consumers would continue to have a large array of choices in fragrances such as Avon, L’Oreal and LVMH and in colour cosmetics, such as L’Oreal and Cosnova. “The Commission concluded that strong independent players would remain active in all the concerned markets,” the Commission, which rules on competition matters in the European Union, said in a statement.

502,PG,"P&G; needs to be more agile, says new CEO Taylor","(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) needs to be more nimble in its decision-making, Chief Executive David Taylor said in his first interaction with analysts after taking the helm in November. Analysts have said the world’s largest consumer products company should split itself up into more manageable businesses so that regional centers are given more control. The management has also been criticized for being too slow in reacting to changing trends in key markets such as China. “A few years ago we got too central and global and too slow to address market opportunities. We need more direct ownership for our regional managers all the way to the store shelf,” Taylor said at an analyst conference in New York. P&G;, which has posted declines in sales for the last six quarters, has been shrinking its portfolio to focus on faster-growing brands such as Tide detergent and Gillette shaving products. “Taylor’s diagnosis is correct and it is encouraging to hear someone talk about the root of the problem,” said Neil Saunders, CEO of retail research firm Conlumino. “While changing the company’s operations is very challenging, (Taylor) does instill confidence that he is going to enact change to bring about a more nimble company.” Taylor offered few surprises during the conference but said the company would not move around talent as often as it had. That may help P&G; improve its performance in markets such as China - the world’s second-largest economy - where it has lost market share to nimbler rivals and local players. “In many ways we looked at China little bit too much as a developing market, as opposed to the most discerning consumers in the world,” Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said at the conference. Moeller said the company was now seeking to make the most of China’s removal of its one-child policy and a growing preference to premium-priced products. While the company does not break down its sales geographically, Moeller said on a post-earnings conference call in January that sales in China were “significantly down” compared with a year earlier. P&G;'s shares have risen 7.3 percent since Jan. 26, when it reported second-quarter results.

504,PG,French consumer group warns on potential risks of beauty products,"PARIS (Reuters) - Some creams, shampoos, after-shaves and toothpastes made by groups such as L’Oreal and Procter & Gamble, may contain potentially harmful substances, according to a study by French consumer protection group UFC-Que Choisir. UFC-Que Choisir on Monday published a list of 185 products it said contained substances that were legal, but could cause allergies, irritations or endocrinal disorders. “In light of the absence of suitable European regulation, we want to put pressure on manufacturers through consumers’ purchasing behavior,” said Olivier Andrault, who ran the study for UFC-Que Choisir. The study pointed, for example, to eight brands of baby wipes including L’Oreal’s Bebe Cadum and Mixa, Beiersdorf’s Nivea and Procter & Gamble’s (P&G;) Pampers that contain phenoxyethanol, which it said could be toxic for the blood and liver. In response to the study, the Federation of Cosmetics Makers (FEBEA) said beauty and hygiene products sold in France were safe and met European regulation, which it described as the most demanding in the world. Nobody was immediately available for comment at Beiersdorf and P&G;, while L’Oreal said it was rigorously committed to the safety of all of its products. “Our safety evaluation system is very robust and all our products and our ingredients are rigorously evaluated before they are put on the market, always in full conformity to the regulation in place,” L’Oreal said in a statement.

The product was one of 344 drug combinations, including several antibiotics and analgesics, that India ordered to be prohibited, saying that a government-appointed panel of experts had found the combinations lacked “therapeutic justification”. P&G; said that all its products, including Vicks Action 500 Extra, were backed by research to support their quality, safety and efficacy. It wasn’t immediately clear how much the product contributed to P&G;’s sales.

513,PG,Fired workers' pregnancy was not 'perfect look' for P&G;: lawsuit,"(Reuters) - A former cosmetics saleswoman for Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) is suing the company, claiming that she was fired after becoming  pregnant and being told earlier by a supervisor that “pregnancy is not part of the uniform.” The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Manhattan on Friday by Tiffany Kantrowitz, who for two years worked at P&G;’s Dolce and Gabbana makeup shop inside Saks Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.  P&G; has a licensing agreement to make and sell Dolce and Gabbana products, according to a company representative who declined to comment on the lawsuit. Neither Dolce and Gabbana nor Saks was named in the lawsuit.  Kantrowitz says she was fired by P&G; in February 2015 after asking to be allowed to sit down while dealing with customers because she was pregnant, in violation of the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act and a similar New York City law. Instead of accommodating Kantrowitz’s request, the lawsuit said, P&G; forced her to take breaks that were deducted from the leave time she was entitled to under the Family and Medical Leave Act. She says she planned to take leave only after her baby was born.  “For (P&G;), ever vigilant about the image of its makeup shop sales associates, pregnancy did not comport with the ‘perfect look,’” the lawsuit said. Before she became pregnant, the suit said, Kantrowitz told a supervisor she wanted children and he responded that “pregnancy is not part of the uniform.” When Kantrowitz was fired, the company told her it was because she had taken “tester” items for personal use, according to the lawsuit. But P&G; encouraged its cosmetics staff to do so, the suit says, and never warned Kantrowitz against it during her time with the company.  Pregnancy discrimination has been a top issue for groups that focus on employment protections for women, along with pay parity and wage increases in industries that employ disproportionate numbers of women. The issue received national attention last year, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N)  improperly denied a pregnant driver’s request not to lift heavy packages. The court, in a 6-3 decision, said employers must offer legitimate business reasons to deny accommodations to pregnant employees, and cannot simply claim it would be expensive or inconvenient.

515,PG,"P&G; profit beats estimates on cost cuts, price hikes","(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), the maker of Tide detergent and Gillette shaving products, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, boosted by cost-cutting and higher selling prices. However, P&G;’s sales declined for the seventh quarter in a row as higher prices weighed on volumes and as the company shrinks its vast product portfolio to focus on faster-growing brands such as Pampers diapers and Pantene shampoo. P&G;’s organic sales – sales excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency impact – increased 1 percent in the third quarter ended March 31. But, analysts have warned that the Cincinnati-based company’s reliance on price hikes, rather than volume growth, to boost organic sales would be unsustainable. P&G; continues to expect organic sales to rise in the low-single digits percentage range in the fiscal year ending June, but sales would be driven by volume rather than pricing in the next two to four quarters, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a media call. The company, whose shares were down 0.5 percent at $80.94 in early trading, said it expects core earnings for the current quarter to be “significantly lower” than a year earlier due to increased advertising costs, a higher tax rate and negative currency impacts. P&G; had lost market share as it has been slow to react to changing trends in key markets including China. But under Chief Executive David Taylor, who took over from A.G. Lafley in November, P&G; has ramped up advertising spending to regain its footing. The company now expects full-year core earnings to fall 3-6 percent, compared with the decline of 3-8 percent it had estimated in January. Net income attributable to P&G; jumped nearly 28 percent to $2.75 billion, or 97 cents per share in the latest quarter. Excluding items, it earned 86 cents per share, beating analysts average estimate of 82 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. P&G;’s cost of goods sold fell by 11 percent. It raised prices, by an average of 1 percent, in four of its five businesses. The company said volumes fell in all businesses, except in the baby, feminine and family care business. Overall volumes declined 2 percent, in part as P&G; decoupled Venezuela results from the total. P&G;’s net revenue fell 7 percent, the smallest drop in three quarters, to $15.76 billion, and included a 5 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange.

525,PG,Unilever sharpens P&G; rivalry by buying Dollar Shave Club,"(Reuters) - Unilever Plc is to buy U.S.-based Dollar Shave Club, expanding its presence in the growing market for male grooming products and sharpening its rivalry with Procter & Gamble which owns the Gillette brand. The surprise move by Unilever, which makes Axe body spray and Dove soap, shows how e-commerce is disrupting the market for consumer packaged goods. It also reduced the attractiveness of rival razor maker Edgewell Personal Care as a takeover target, analysts said, sending its shares down 1.9 percent. Unilever, P&G; and others have put more focus on men in recent years, trying to coax them into spending more on deodorants, skin creams and hair products. Terms of Unilever’s deal, announced late on Tuesday, were not disclosed. However, Fortune cited sources saying it is paying $1 billion in cash for the company, which sells razors and blades directly to consumers via online subscriptions . Unilever declined to comment on the report. Dollar Shave Club’s turnover is expected to grow to over $200 million in 2016 from $152 million last year, Unilever said. Based on those figures, Unilever would be paying five times annual sales for Dollar Shave Club, higher than most U.S. consumer deals, which get done at below four times. Jefferies analysts said the deal gives Unilever 60 percent of the U.S. subscription “shave club” market, versus only 5 percent for P&G;’s Gillette, and 11 percent of the U.S. blades market overall. “Unilever are parking their tanks on P&G;’s lawn in one of their most profitable categories,” Jefferies said, adding that the move risks potentially value-destroying retaliation. Unilever and Procter have a history of battle. In 2013, they fought a price war for haircare products that ate into margins. Dollar Shave Club founder Michael Dublin will continue to run the company after the deal closes, expected in the third quarter of 2016. The U.S. market for men’s grooming products rose 4 percent last year to $8.5 billion, according to Euromonitor, fuelled by online sales of men’s shaving products which it said reached $342 million. Analysts were divided on whether Unilever’s purchase of Dollar Shave Club makes it more likely to go on to buy Edgewell which has brands including Schick and Edge. Canaccord Genuity analysts said they still see Edgewell as a further possible target, as Unilever would look to build scale, but Bernstein said it could just keep attacking Edgewell and Gillette without owning the manufacturing. This deal does, however, make Edgewell less attractive to other potential suitors such as Henkel, Johnson & Johnson and Colgate-Palmolive, Bernstein said, since they would have to compete with both P&G; and Unilever. “This was a smart tactical move by Unilever in that it puts up barriers to others who might want to acquire Edgewell, while leaving it as an option to come back to and build scale,” Bernstein said.

530,PG,"Berkshire's Duracell to close S.Carolina plant, affecting 430 workers","(Reuters) - Duracell said it plans to close a battery-making plant in South Carolina that employs 430 people, making the announcement fewer than five months after being acquired by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. The shutdown of the Lancaster, South Carolina, plant, which made AA batteries, will begin in March and should be completed by the middle of 2019, Duracell said in a statement dated Wednesday. Duracell is consolidating its North American production of AA and AAA batteries into a plant in LaGrange, Georgia. “This was a very difficult decision,” Robert Lorch, Duracell’s president of global operations, said in a statement. “We’re taking this important step to position the Duracell business for growth.” Duracell said the move will lead to “some” job growth in LaGrange, which is about 330 miles (531 km) southwest of Lancaster, and that Lancaster workers will be encouraged to apply for work there. The company, which said it has about 3,000 employees, also makes C and D batteries in a plant in Cleveland, Tennessee. Berkshire acquired Bethel, Connecticut-based Duracell plus $1.8 billion of cash on Feb. 29 in exchange for about $4.2 billion of stock it held in Procter & Gamble Co, Duracell’s former owner. Since 1965, Buffett has built Berkshire into a conglomerate with roughly 90 operating businesses employing more than 360,000 people. He prefers to leave day-to-day decision making, including job cuts, to executives who run those businesses.

543,PG,"P&G; profit beats on cost cuts, demand for home care goods","(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), the maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by cost-cutting and strong demand for its baby, feminine and home care products. P&G;’s shares were up 4.6 percent at $87.97 on Tuesday morning. The company has been selling off unprofitable brands and focusing on core brands such as Tide, Pampers and Gillette to revive sluggish sales. P&G; sold 41 of its brands, including Clairol and Wella, to Coty Inc (COTY.N) in a $12.5 billion deal earlier this month. P&G; is also planning to save as much as $10 billion in costs over the next five years, after cutting the same amount in costs over the last five years. The company plans to reinvest a significant portion of savings from the new plan in product and packaging improvement, research and development, and expanding sales coverage, P&G;’s Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a media call. Organic sales in P&G;’s fabric and home care business - its largest - rose 4 percent in the first quarter, while those in baby, feminine and family care, the second largest, rose 2 percent. The two businesses, which house brands such as Tide, Febreze, Pampers and Tampex, together accounted for 60 percent of the company’s total revenue. P&G;’s revenue was driven by “solid” volume growth of 3 percent in the quarter, in contrast to rivals such as Unilever (ULVR.L), whose sales were mainly propped up by price hikes, Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy wrote in a note. Net sales remained largely flat at $16.52 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, but beat the average estimate of $16.49 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales in the United Kingdom, P&G;’s largest European market, fell 2 percent in the quarter, Moeller said. Britain’s vote to leave the European Union has caused a plunge in the pound, leading consumer goods makers such as Unilever to attempt to raise prices in the market. Moeller declined to discuss P&G;’s pricing strategy, but said the UK continued to be a “very challenging and highly promotional” market. P&G; said net income attributable to the company rose 4.3 percent to $2.71 billion, or 96 cents per share. Excluding items, P&G; earned $1.03 per share from continuing operations, beating the average analyst estimate of 98 cents.

Whirlpool cited soft demand as it posted lower-than- expected earnings and gave an underwhelming guidance, while Sherwin Williams’ outlook was also a disappointment for Wall Street, an indication to some analysts that the housing sector may be cooling. “Lackluster results from Whirlpool and Sherwin Williams may indicate a slowing in the housing cycle,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said those results could be weighing on Home Depot , which was down 3.3 percent at $123.60 as the largest points decliner on the S&P; 500. 3M fell 3 percent to $166.14 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. But overall, annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P; 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, effectively putting an end to an earnings recession, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average was off 45.71 points, or 0.25 percent, to 18,177.32, the S&P; 500 lost 7.49 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,143.84 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 28.13 points, or 0.53 percent, to 5,281.70. Caterpillar slipped 1.7 percent after giving a downbeat forecast, while General Motors fell 4.3 percent amid fears regarding future profits. Consumer products company Procter & Gamble rose 3.9 percent to $87.35 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, while sportswear maker Under Armour  fell 13.1 percent to $32.94 after it reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.51-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.16-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P; 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 57 new highs and 71 new lows.

553,PG,"UPDATE 2-Coty says sales slide to continue in current quarter, shares fall","(Reuters) - Beauty products maker Coty Inc (COTY.N) reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue, due to a slump in demand for its fragrances and color cosmetics, and said the slowdown in revenue would continue in the current quarter. The company’s stock fell as much as 15.6 percent to $18.48 on Wednesday, a day after the U.S election, its lowest level since January last year. On a call with analysts, executives attributed the continuing sales weakness to distractions caused by the integration of Procter & Gamble Co’s (PG.N) specialty beauty business, which Coty acquired for $12.5 billion. “People are not necessarily fully focused on the business ... they are in transition ... helping out on the integration of the business so those have caused distractions and caused us to lose momentum in the business,” Coty Chairman Bart Becht said on the call. The company also said that challenges in the consumer beauty business and the previously-announced sale of 6-8 percent of its product portfolio would hurt second-quarter sales. Becht said the results of the recently concluded U.S. presidential election do not affect the company’s plans. Fragrance sales fell 9 percent on a like-for-like basis, while color cosmetics fell 6 percent in the first quarter ended Sept. 30. These two segments are its biggest contributors to revenue. “This period of integration for Coty has been met with less than stellar underlying performance and lack of clarity has created anxiety in the stock,” Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink said in a note. Coty has inked multiple deals to transform itself into a global beauty products giant, as it reduces its dependence on its struggling fragrance business. After buying P&G;’s specialty beauty business, the company acquired ghd, a high-end hairstyling appliance brand, from private equity firm Lion Capital LLP for about $522 million. Coty posted no profit during the first quarter ended Sept. 30. In the year-earlier quarter, the company reported a net income of $125.7 million, or 34 cents per share. Net revenue fell to $1.08 billion from $1.11 billion. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $1.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of Coty, which owns cosmetics brands like COVERGIRL and Rimmel, were down 13.2 percent in early trading. The stock has fallen as much as 23 percent in the last 12 months.

P&G; and Coke were down 1.2 percent after Goldman Sachs downgraded both the consumer staple stocks. Dow e-minis were down 48 points, or 0.24 percent, with 18,608 contracts changing hands. S&P; 500 e-minis  were down 3.25 points, or 0.14 percent, with 88,660 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 1.5 points, or 0.03 percent, on volume of 17,200 contracts. The Dow hit a record 19,999.63 points on Friday, while the S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq also hit all-time highs, after a late pop in Apple and other technology stocks. Wall Street has rallied since Donald Trump won the U.S. election in November as investors bet he will introduce business-friendly policies. But the rally has led to lofty valuations - the S&P; is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14. That could make investors cautious as they gear up for the fourth-quarter earnings season. “The market is building drama around 20,000 and if and when we get promising earnings reports, the Dow will go through the point like a hot knife through butter,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. The first peek into how companies fared last quarter will be provided later this week by big U.S. banks, including JPMorgan , Bank of America and Wells Fargo. S&P; 500 companies overall are expected to post a 6.1 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Oil prices fell more than 2 percent on Monday as signs of growing U.S. production outweighed optimism that other producers were sticking to a deal to cut supply to bolster prices. Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren on Monday called for the U.S. central bank to step up its pace of interest-rate hikes, warning of inflation risks if it did not. Among stocks, Dow component UnitedHealth slipped 0.5 percent to $161.58 premarket after its Optum unit said it would buy Surgical Care Affiliates Inc for about $2.30 billion. Surgical Care’s stock was up 15 percent. VCA Inc, which runs hospitals for animals, soared nearly 29 percent to $91 premarket after Mars Inc said it would buy the company for $7.7 billion. DaVita’s shares lost 4.7 percent to $62.7 after the company and Germany’s Fresenius Medical said they got subpoenas from federal prosecutors relating to a charity that helps patients pay for kidney dialysis. Healthcare stocks will be in focus for the day as a number of companies present at J.P. Morgan’s healthcare conference.

559,PG,Nelson Peltz picks good time to scrub P&G;,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - For Nelson Peltz and his big investment in Procter & Gamble, the timing could be as important as the strategy. The pushy investor’s Trian disclosed a $3.5 billion position in the Tide-to-Crest conglomerate on Tuesday, but not any proposals. Whatever he has in mind, consumer stocks like P&G; are well positioned for a tougher economic environment. P&G; has proven a tough target. Fellow corporate agitator Bill Ackman plowed some $1.8 billion into the company in mid-2012. After helping push out the chief executive to bring back former boss A. G. Lafley, Ackman’s Pershing Square exited after just two years without the big return he typically expects from his concentrated investments. Since Ackman’s departure, P&G; has made some further progress. Lafley was replaced by David Taylor, a P&G; veteran who promised to keep streamlining the enterprise. P&G; offloaded Duracell batteries and beauty brands Clairol and Covergirl. Even so, moving the share price at the $230 billion titan has been difficult, opening the door for Peltz. Breaking up the company may be one option. Although Peltz unsuccessfully pushed such an idea at Pepsi, Bernstein analysts already have sent letters to Taylor and the board encouraging the idea. Gillette could be an area of focus for Peltz. P&G; paid more than $50 billion for it in 2005, but the razor operation has come under increasing pressure from startups like Harry’s that offer cheaper alternatives by way of subscription services that cater to younger consumers. Unilever recently bought rival Dollar Shave Club, giving it a stronger backer. Either way, P&G; at least offers some downside protection for Peltz. Consumer staples are often resilient when the economy starts to crack. P&G; boasts one of the most consistent dividend track records in U.S. corporate annals, an especially prized feature when stock prices stagnate. The United States is already at near full employment and the stretch of growth since 2009 is one of the longest in the country’s history. That suggests another recession may not be far off. Odds are that Peltz has something bigger in mind, but he picked a good time to try scrubbing up P&G.;",2162017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-procter-gamble-stake-breakingviews/nelson-peltz-picks-good-time-to-scrub-pg-idUSKBN15V2Y2

571,PG,Activist investor Nelson Peltz files for P&G; board seat - CNBC,"June 16 (Reuters) - Activist investor Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management has filed a notice for a board seat at Procter & Gamble Co, CNBC reported on Friday, citing a source close to the matter. Trian, which is the Tide and Gillette maker's fifth largest shareholder with a 1.44 percent stake, initially revealed its stake in the company in February, at a time P&G; was undergoing a cost-cutting program and shedding brands to boost sluggish sales. (cnb.cx/2tv3OfZ) Trian’s stake was seen as a move to increase pressure on the company to accelerate cost cuts as well as raised hopes for a breakup of the company, but as the investment fund has yet to publish a white paper, the firm’s exact plan remains unknown. A spokeswoman for Trian declined to comment. P&G; spokesman Damon Jones said that he could not disclose any details on the company’s engagement with Trian, but that discussions with the activist fund were “ongoing and constructive”. He also said that a proxy filing, to be filed late in summer, would contain all the disclosures. According to the company’s proxy filing in 2016, an eligible shareholder wishing to nominate a candidate for election to the board at the 2017 annual meeting must provide such notice no earlier than May 14, 2017 and no later than June 13, 2017. The company’s annual meeting is usually held in the month of October. P&G;’s shares were marginally down at $89.21 in morning trading.

574,PG,"Trian takes off the gloves, aiming to put Peltz on P&G;'s board","(Reuters) - Activist investor Nelson Peltz is seeking a seat on Procter & Gamble Co’s (PG.N) board, taking public his frustrations with the company’s lagging stock price and railing against its “suffocating bureaucracy.” Trian Fund Management LP on Monday announced the nomination of its chief executive and co-founder Peltz, launching the largest proxy fight ever against a $223 billion consumer products juggernaut that sells everything from Tide detergent and Gillette razors to Pampers diapers.  Peltz’s nomination comes after five months of behind-the-scenes discussions between Trian and P&G;’s top executives and board, according to the company’s proxy filing. At one point, the two sides nearly struck a truce in May that would involve P&G; laying out certain performance metrics over the next year.  But any sign of an agreement was absent on Monday when both came out swinging. The 180-year-old company, founded on a hand-shake agreement by a soap and a candle maker, issued a statement strongly backing its board and strategic plan. See Breakingviews column: Trian, which owns about $3.3 billion of P&G;’s stock, or 1.5 percent of the company, has until an October annual meeting to convince fellow shareholders that Peltz deserves to be voted onto the board.  The firm’s campaign website (revitalizepg.com) and press release has few immediate changes proposed for the company other than advocating for a geographic organizational structure that it believes will empower divisional leaders to make faster and better decisions. Shares of P&G; were up slightly at $87.72 in afternoon trade.      Trian's previous battle with a consumer goods conglomerate was with PepsiCo Inc PEP.N, where it pressured the company to spin off its beverage business from its snacks division, a campaign that the company never heeded though it did hand the investor a board seat in 2015 to make peace. (reut.rs/2uvu0ea) That campaign began with Trian advocating Peltz for Pepsi’s board and ended with industry veteran William Johnson joining as Trian’s representative.  In a CNBC interview on Monday, Peltz, 75, talked more about Trian’s track record with companies such as H.J. Heinz than actual operational changes needed at P&G.; Peltz railed against the company’s “suffocating bureaucracy,” but noted he was on good terms with CEO David Taylor. Trian said it wants P&G; to cut costs more efficiently, and that it does not want to replace Taylor, any board directors, or to break-up the company. Since Taylor became CEO in November, 2015, P&G;’s stock has gained 0.3 percent. In contrast, the S&P; 500 Household Products index .SPLRCPROD, which includes Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N) and Clorox Co (CLX.N), has risen 12 percent over the same period.      P&G;’s quarterly organic sales, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, has fallen just once during his one and half years at the helm. For this year, the consumer goods giant expects a 2-3 percent rise in organic sales growth. The Trian-P&G; battle comes as activist investors, emboldened by years of successful campaigns for changes at corporations across the U.S. and abroad, use their growing coffers to seek bigger targets. Trian won two seats on H.J. Heinz’s board in its 2006 proxy fight, and lost its battle to get board representation at industrial conglomerate DuPont DD.N in 2015.  P&G;’s proxy filing, disclosed on Monday, shows that Trian’s dialogue with the company goes back to Feb. 16, when Peltz called Taylor shortly after disclosing the stake to make the introduction and set up an in-person meeting.  “I am quite surprised and very disappointed because I think David (Taylor) and I have developed a very positive relationship,” Peltz told CNBC, when asked if he was surprised that the dialogue had turned into a proxy fight. “I like the man.”  Trian said in a press release that its bid to get Peltz on the board centers on P&G;'s continuing underperformance, costs, complexity and culture. (bit.ly/2t7h62c) With P&G;’s annual meeting usually held in October, the two sides have roughly three months to discuss ways to avoid a shareholder vote on Peltz. If elected, Trian has said it wants P&G; to expand the board to 12 members rather than have Peltz replace a sitting director. P&G;’s current board has six past or current CEOs, including American Express CEO Kenneth Chenault and Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman. “P&G; has a best-in-class board of directors that is fully supportive of and actively engaged in overseeing the company’s transformation,” the company said on Monday. P&G;’s proxy filing noted that last Tuesday, in a meeting between Trian and members of P&G;’s board, Trian said it was moving ahead to elect Peltz because the company was not moving fast enough to improve its performance.  P&G; directors at the meeting said they too were not happy with the performance, but that they felt that Trian’s representation on the board was unnecessary in light of recent initiatives undertaken by the company,” the filing said.  In a bid to boost profits even as sales remain stagnant, P&G; has sold unprofitable brands, including 41 beauty brands to Coty Inc (COTY.N), and focused on core brands. However, the efforts have failed to boost the stock much beyond the level where it traded at the beginning of this year.  Trian said that P&G;’s last cost-cutting plan, launched in 2012, failed to impact profit or sales growth. Barclays noted on Monday that Trian is working with former P&G; CFO Clayt Daley, a consultant on the campaign who could become a potential board candidate to replace Peltz as part of the negotiations.

575,PG,US STOCKS-Wall St ends flat; Netflix jumps after the bell,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed little changed in low volume on Monday as gains in utilities and consumer stocks offset declines in healthcare, with earnings news filtering out winners and losers across the board. BlackRock shares (BLK.N) fell 3.1 percent to $424.63 after the world’s biggest asset manager’s quarterly profit came in below expectations. After the closing bell, Netflix (NFLX.O) shares jumped 8.5 percent to $175.45 following better than expected subscriber growth. Procter & Gamble (PG.N) rose 0.5 percent to $87.55 as investor Nelson Peltz actively seeks a seat on P&G;’s board. Health stocks on the S&P; 500 .SPXHC slipped, partly weighed down by a delay in the U.S. Senate’s consideration of healthcare legislation after news over the weekend that Arizona Republican Senator John McCain would remain in his home state next week following a medical procedure. “I think we’ve got to see some dry ink on the healthcare bill before you can make broad bets on that sector,” said Erick Ormsby, CEO of Alcosta Capital Management in San Ramon, California. “[A] bulk of funds will come in as we see clarity on [the] healthcare bill.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 8.02 points, or 0.04 percent, to 21,629.72, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 0.13 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,459.14 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 1.97 points, or 0.03 percent, to 6,314.43. The S&P; health sector fell 0.3 percent while utilities gained 0.4 percent and the consumer discretionary sector rose 0.26 percent. Amazon (AMZN.O) led discretionary sector gains with a 0.8 percent increase to $1,010.04. Meal-kit company Blue Apron Holdings (APRN.N) fell 10.5 percent to $6.59 after an Amazon unit filed a trademark for a competing meal-kit service earlier this month. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.28-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.09-to-1 ratio favored advancers. In what could be the slowest full session by volume so far this year, about 5.16 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.51 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Trian said it wants P&G; to cut costs more efficiently, and that it does not want to replace Taylor, any board directors, or to break-up the company. Since Taylor became CEO in November, 2015, P&G;’s stock has gained 0.3 percent. In contrast, the S&P; 500 Household Products index .SPLRCPROD, which includes Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N) and Clorox Co (CLX.N), has risen 12 percent over the same period.      P&G;’s quarterly organic sales, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, has fallen just once during his one and half years at the helm. For this year, the consumer goods giant expects a 2-3 percent rise in organic sales growth. The Trian-P&G; battle comes as activist investors, emboldened by years of successful campaigns for changes at corporations across the U.S. and abroad, use their growing coffers to seek bigger targets. Trian won two seats on H.J. Heinz’s board in its 2006 proxy fight, and lost its battle to get board representation at industrial conglomerate DuPont DD.N in 2015.  P&G;’s proxy filing, disclosed on Monday, shows that Trian’s dialogue with the company goes back to Feb. 16, when Peltz called Taylor shortly after disclosing the stake to make the introduction and set up an in-person meeting.  “I am quite surprised and very disappointed because I think David (Taylor) and I have developed a very positive relationship,” Peltz told CNBC, when asked if he was surprised that the dialogue had turned into a proxy fight. “I like the man.”  Trian said in a press release that its bid to get Peltz on the board centers on P&G;'s continuing underperformance, costs, complexity and culture. (bit.ly/2t7h62c) With P&G;’s annual meeting usually held in October, the two sides have roughly three months to discuss ways to avoid a shareholder vote on Peltz. If elected, Trian has said it wants P&G; to expand the board to 12 members rather than have Peltz replace a sitting director. P&G;’s current board has six past or current CEOs, including American Express CEO Kenneth Chenault and Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman. “P&G; has a best-in-class board of directors that is fully supportive of and actively engaged in overseeing the company’s transformation,” the company said on Monday. P&G;’s proxy filing noted that last Tuesday, in a meeting between Trian and members of P&G;’s board, Trian said it was moving ahead to elect Peltz because the company was not moving fast enough to improve its performance.  P&G; directors at the meeting said they too were not happy with the performance, but that they felt that Trian’s representation on the board was unnecessary in light of recent initiatives undertaken by the company,” the filing said.  In a bid to boost profits even as sales remain stagnant, P&G; has sold unprofitable brands, including 41 beauty brands to Coty Inc (COTY.N), and focused on core brands. However, the efforts have failed to boost the stock much beyond the level where it traded at the beginning of this year.  Trian said that P&G;’s last cost-cutting plan, launched in 2012, failed to impact profit or sales growth. Barclays noted on Monday that Trian is working with former P&G; CFO Clayt Daley, a consultant on the campaign who could become a potential board candidate to replace Peltz as part of the negotiations.

579,PG,Peltz goes for the close shave at Procter & Gamble,"DALLAS (Reuters Breakingviews) - Corporate agitator Nelson Peltz is opting for the close shave at Procter & Gamble. Unlike his last proxy fight at DuPont, the activist’s Trian Partners, which owns a $3.3 billion stake, is taking a more surgical approach to the $223 billion razors-to-detergent company, lobbying for a single board seat. Trian is also dangling niceties, like promising to support management and not calling for a breakup. Given Procter’s myriad challenges, shareholders would be silly to pass on his assistance. The Cincinnati-based group whose brands include Gillette, Tide and Pampers, is struggling to navigate changing consumer habits. Upstarts like Dollar Shave Club have cut into its market share of products with easy online purchasing and delivery, and original marketing. P&G; is growing its online presence and has fought back with price cuts, but its stock price has lagged competitors and the S&P; 500 in the past year, and – as Peltz points out – over the past decade. Revenue in P&G;’s fiscal third quarter declined. Company lifer David Taylor, who became CEO two years ago, drummed up some new costs to cut, but analysts appear underwhelmed by P&G;’s focus on “irresistibly superior” products. Trian said it is concerned that $13 billion of identified cost savings will not materialize given an “overly complex organizational structure and a slow moving and insular culture.” While those may sound like fighting words, Peltz’s push comes with a smiley emoticon. Trian is not seeking a breakup, or to push out Taylor, or even cut research and marketing expenses. Peltz’s first move as director would be to reinstate the board member he displaces. It’s a notable contrast with Trian’s approach at DuPont, where it sought four board seats and urged for a separation of businesses. Trian got no seats, but the CEO was out five months later and Dupont announced a merger with Dow Chemical that will lead to a breakup. P&G;’s board may still be smarting from its last nick with activism. In 2013, hedge-fund boss Bill Ackman persuaded P&G; to remove its CEO and bring back former boss A.G. Lafley. He then sold his shares. Yet the company’s share price has increased less than 10 percent over the past four years – the stock market equivalent of five o’clock shadow. Peltz may not have all the answers to P&G;’s troubles, but a fresh look on the board is warranted.",7172017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-procter-gamble-stake-breakingviews/peltz-goes-for-the-close-shave-at-procter-gamble-idUSKBN1A21NH

Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, IBM and Johnson and Johnson are scheduled to report results this week. Netflix, which will report results after the market close on Monday, rose 1 percent in premarket trading. Analysts estimate second-quarter earnings for the S&P; 500 companies rose 8.1 percent from a year earlier. First-quarter earnings posted their best performance since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters data. Earnings will be closely watched to see if high valuations are justified in the face of tepid inflation and a recent patch of mixed economic data. The S&P; 500 has been trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, compared with the long-term average of 15 times. “The U.S. market isn’t cheap right now,” said Phil Guarco, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. “Earnings are going to take an important role. We’re in a situation where the corporate profits and the profits they are going to deliver in the future will be of keen interest.” Dow e-minis were up 14 points, or 0.06 percent, with 14,981 contracts changing hands at 8:30 a.m. ET (1230 GMT). S&P; 500 e-minis were up 1.25 points, or 0.05 percent, with 107,776 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 7.25 points, or 0.12 percent, on volume of 20,886 contracts. The Dow and the S&P; hit record highs on Friday after weak economic data dulled prospects of more interest rate hikes this year. Last week, investor sentiment got a boost after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said future rate hikes could be gradual in the face of persistently low inflation. The Fed will meet next on July 25-26. “Apart from earnings, the biggest driver has been the rate hike trajectory. The central banks need to be more transparent and continue to project that the unwinding of quantitative easing will be done in an extremely gentle way,” said Guarco. World shares continued to hover near record highs after data showed China’s economy grew at a faster-than-forecast 6.9 percent year-on-year in the second quarter. Shares of BlackRock fell 2.6 percent after the world’s biggest asset manager’s quarterly profit came in below expectations. Procter & Gamble edged up 0.7 percent after activist investor Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management said it is seeking a board seat at the company.

584,PG,UPDATE 3-Unilever lifts margin target as industry pressure mounts,"LONDON (Reuters) - Unilever (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS) lifted its annual profitability  target on Thursday after cost cuts led to a big improvement in the first half of the year, showing it can boost returns after rebuffing a $143 billion takeover bid.  The savings at Unilever come as the packaged goods industry’s biggest names, including Nestle (NESN.S) and Procter & Gamble (PG.N), are being targeted by shareholder activists pushing for better returns. Unilever, whose own margins came under scrutiny in the wake of February’s shock takeover bid from Kraft Heinz (KHC.O), said on Thursday that such investor pressure was becoming the norm. “It’s something that we keep on our radar screens here ourselves,” Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said. “We all have to deal with it and we’re realistic about that.” The Anglo-Dutch conglomerate, whose products range from Hellmann’s mayonnaise to Dove soap, stepped up its savings. It now expects its underlying operating margin to grow by at least 100 basis points this year, up from the target of at least 80 basis points given in April when it announced the results of a review sparked by the Kraft bid.   Unilever shares were up 1.2 percent at 1430 GMT. They remain roughly 30 percent higher than before the bid on expectations of more aggressive earnings growth.  Some analysts speculate that Kraft could return with another bid, once the six-month cooling off period required by the UK takeover panel expires next month.    “Unilever know they cannot relax and investors expect them to raise their game,” said Steve Clayton, fund manager at Hargreaves Lansdown Select, whose funds are 5 percent invested in Unilever.  Unilever’s underlying operating margin improved 180 basis points to 17.8 percent in the last six months, helped by an acceleration of cost-savings programs, and a 130 basis point drop in brand and marketing spending. Its goal is to reach 20 percent by 2020.   Analysts welcomed the margin improvement, but voiced concern that it was driven by reduced marketing, which can hit sales. “Quantity good ... quality less so,” RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote. Unilever said marketing spending would rise in the second half, as new product launches were skewed to that period, adding that full-year spend should match the previous year.  Unilever saved more than 1 billion euros in the first half of the year, bringing it closer to its target for 6 billion euros in three years.  Cuts include reducing the number of laundry powder formulations by 65 percent, reducing employee airline flights by 30 percent and lowering middle and senior management headcount by 13 percent.      Underlying sales rose 3 percent in both the second quarter and the first half, excluding currency fluctuations and acquisitions. That was slightly below analysts’ average expectations for growth of 3.2 percent for the quarter and 3.1 percent for the half, according to a company-supplied consensus. Growth for the six months was due entirely to pricing, as volume was flat. But volume should accelerate in the back half of the year, Unilever said, helped by new products. The company stood by its full-year forecast for growth in the 3 to 5 percent range.  Underlying earnings per share rose 14.4 percent to 1.13 euros per share. Regarding the sale of its margarine and spreads business, CFO Pitkethly said Unilever planned to distribute details by the end of autumn. The firm is carving out the whole business, which operates in some 60 countries, but could sell it in pieces.  Pitkethly said industry players might be able to add value to the emerging market business, while developed markets might be more interesting to private equity players. “We don’t have to sell it in one block and will only do that if it’s a superior value solution,” Pitkethly told Reuters.

The Tide detergent and Gillette razor maker’s shares were up about 1 percent at $90.17 in afternoon trading on Thursday. P&G;’s report comes amid rising pressure from investors, including Peltz, to prop up its stock price and sales, which have lagged those of peers such as Unilever Plc (ULVR.L). While P&G;'s organic sales rose 2 percent in the latest quarter, Unilever's increased 3 percent in the same period. P&G;'s shares, which have risen 6 percent this year, have also lagged the S&P; 500 .SPX, which is up 10.7 percent. After more than four years of divestiture-driven sales declines, P&G; reported net sales that were flat at $16.08 billion in the quarter, helped in part by demand for its beauty and fabric & home care products such as SK-II and Tide Pods.  P&G; has been cutting costs and selling unprofitable brands to revive growth. Selling, general and administrative expenses fell 7 percent in the quarter. “While P&G; says it is addressing the underperformance issue, shareholders have heard similar promises in the past and results have not materially improved,” Peltz, who owns a $3.3 billion stake, said in a statement following the report.  Earlier this month, Peltz said he was seeking a board seat to get P&G; to cut costs more efficiently, but without replacing its chief executive David Taylor, any board directors, or breaking up the company.  “There’s nothing incremental (Peltz has) offered. I want to prevent anything from derailing the work we’re doing… The fact that he has good advice doesn’t mean we just add him to the board,” Taylor told CNBC in an interview.

591,PG,"P&G; hits back at Peltz, says investor not entitled to board seat","(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble (PG.N) blasted Nelson Peltz’s efforts to join the consumer goods conglomerate’s board, saying the investor was not entitled to a seat and that he was being wrongly advised by people who were not in tune with the company’s operations. P&G;’s salvo comes weeks after Peltz’s Trian Fund Management sought a board seat for the activist investor at the company, making P&G; the largest company ever to face a proxy battle. In a statement to shareholders, the maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors said Peltz offered no new “actionable ideas” that the company hadn’t already implemented. “”Why not?” is not a compelling rationale to add Mr. Peltz to the P&G; Board. “Why not?” appears to be the extent of Mr. Peltz’s reason for board membership. This is simply not a sufficient standard,” Chief Executive David Taylor said. “Joining P&G;’s board is not an entitlement.” Peltz, whose hedge fund Trian has amassed an about 1.5 percent stake in the company, launched the proxy battle, after five months of negotiations with P&G;’s management failed to get him a board seat. The investor, who is being advised by former P&G; CFO Clayton Daley, has been pushing the company to cut costs more efficiently as well as eliminate its “suffocating bureaucracy”.

592,PG,"P&G; hits back at Peltz, says investor not entitled to board seat","(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble (PG.N) blasted Nelson Peltz’s efforts to join the consumer goods conglomerate’s board, saying the investor was not entitled to a seat and that he was being wrongly advised by people who were not in tune with the company’s operations. P&G;’s salvo comes weeks after Peltz’s Trian Fund Management sought a board seat for the activist investor at the company, making P&G; the largest company ever to face a proxy battle. In a statement to shareholders, the maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors said Peltz offered no new “actionable ideas” that the company hadn’t already implemented. “”Why not?” is not a compelling rationale to add Mr. Peltz to the P&G; Board. “Why not?” appears to be the extent of Mr. Peltz’s reason for board membership. This is simply not a sufficient standard,” Chief Executive David Taylor said. “Joining P&G;’s board is not an entitlement.” Peltz, whose hedge fund Trian has amassed an about 1.5 percent stake in the company, launched the proxy battle, after five months of negotiations with P&G;’s management failed to get him a board seat. The investor, who is being advised by former P&G; CFO Clayton Daley, has been pushing the company to cut costs more efficiently as well as eliminate its “suffocating bureaucracy”. In a proxy filing on Monday, Peltz said Trian’s analysis showed that a P&G; cost-cutting program launched in 2012, aimed at saving $10 billion over five years, had no discernible impact on profit or sales growth.

599,PG,Coty says some of its P&G; brands to stay under pressure until 2018,"(Reuters) - Coty Inc (COTY.N) reported a surprise quarterly loss and warned that it expected retailers to reduce stocking some of the beauty products the company acquired from Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) until the second half of 2018.    Shares of the U.S. beauty products maker fell 13 percent to $17 in afternoon trading on Tuesday. Retailers have been limiting shelf space for brands such as CoverGirl and Clairol, which Coty acquired from P&G; in 2016, and instead have been stocking up on trendy brands such as NYX and ELF.    “Shelf space loss has been an issue that we faced in the fourth quarter and it will continue to impact us until the second half of fiscal 2018,” Chief Executive Camillo Pane told Reuters. Coty’s consumer beauty unit, which is a key revenue contributor and houses CoverGirl and Clairol, reported a 10 percent decline in organic sales, which excludes currency fluctuations and acquisitions. “The P&G; deal is a big question mark,” said Rosie Edwards, London-based analyst at research firm Berenberg. There are concerns whether the likes of Clairol and Max Factor can compete in the color cosmetics and haircare businesses that have disruptive brands like L’Oreal and ELF Cosmetics, she said. Coty reported an adjusted net loss of $3.4 million due to “materially” higher marketing spend for the launch of fragrances such as Gucci Bloom and Hugo Boss Tonic, and higher fixed costs related to the acquisition of P&G;’s brands. The company reported break even on a per share basis compared with analysts’ estimates of a profit of 9 cents per share.        “We are rapidly working to address (fixed costs)... Our cost base is not where it should be and we are highly focused on this issue as a key initiative for fiscal 2018,” Pane said in a statement. Coty’s costs rose to 53.1 percent of sales in the quarter, from 46.6 percent, a year earlier. The company’s results were in contrast to rival Estee Lauder (EL.N), which last week posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit as its makeup segment did well. Coty’s quarterly revenue rose 5 percent to $2.24 billion on an adjusted constant currency basis, helped by its increased marketing efforts on its luxury brands such as Gucci Bloom and Hugo Boss Tonic.

603,PG,Trian proposes shake-up to P&G;'s structure and strategy,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Activist investor Trian Partners on Wednesday released its long-awaited plan to boost shares of Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), detailing changes intended to streamline and rejuvenate the maker of Crest toothpaste, Tide laundry detergent and Pampers diapers.  The release of the 94-page proposal comes as the two sides are locked in a battle over efforts by Trian co-founder Nelson Peltz to join the 12-member board of the consumer products company. P&G; has resisted, saying Peltz is a bad fit for the board and has an outdated view on how the Cincinnati, Ohio-based company operates.  Shareholders will vote on Oct. 10 on whether to add Peltz to the board. Valued at $232 billion, P&G; would be the biggest U.S. company by market capitalization to face a proxy fight.   “Trian believes P&G; should be organized into three largely autonomous business units under a lean holding company,” the hedge fund said in its proposal. The company is currently comprised of four global business units.  Trian, P&G;’s fifth-largest shareholder, also said the company’s management compensation plan is tied to three-year goals that are set too low. Procter & Gamble said in a statement that the company is executing a winning strategy, as evidenced by its 2017 fiscal year results.  “We remain focused on delivering our plan, while preventing anything from derailing the progress we are making to create value for all P&G; shareholders.”   Trian’s $3.5 billion P&G; investment became public earlier this year, but its strategy on how to boost the company’s shares had until now remained behind closed doors. Other proposed changes include Peltz offering to lead a board study on how P&G; can improve innovation, having “failed to create a new meaningful brand in nearly 20 years” according to Trian. Peltz would also encourage the board to groom more outside leadership talent and to have P&G; focus its acquisition strategy on buying and developing smaller, more local brands, Trian said.  Trian has touted Peltz’s experience on boards of other consumer companies including Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), Sysco Corp (SYY.N) and Triangle Industries Inc, a packaging company where Peltz was chairman and chief executive from 1983 to 1988. P&G; is organized into four global business units: Baby, Feminine and Family Care; Beauty; Fabric and Home Care; and Health and Grooming. P&G;, which has been cutting costs and selling off brands, reported net sales last quarter that were flat at $16.08 billion. Trian proposes shrinking that to three groups, each with a regional leader with full control of the business, its profits and its losses: Beauty, Grooming and Healthcare; Fabric and Home Care; and Baby, Feminine and Family Care. Under the new organization, the CEO would oversee the three business leaders. The three business divisions would sit under a holding company, which controls public company functions and costs, Trian said. According to Trian, P&G;’s management compensation plan is tied to three-year goals that are too low, including a 2.8 percent organic sales target, which is lower than the company’s 3 percent to 3.5 percent market growth target. Trian has taken swipes previously at P&G;’s bureaucracy and stock performance compared to peers, a dig it repeated in its plan, citing a total shareholder return over the last decade that trailed both peers and the S&P; 500. P&G;, shares of which have risen 10 percent this year to $92.72, has countered that the company’s stock performance has outperformed since CEO David Taylor took over in Nov. 2015. Since then, P&G; said in a letter to shareholders last month that total shareholder return has risen 28 percent through mid-August, beating peers.

610,PG,UPDATE 1-Germany's Merck hires JP Morgan to sell consumer health,"FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Germany’s Merck KGaA (MRCG.DE) has hired JP Morgan (JPM.N) to sell its consumer health business, which includes brands such as Seven Seas vitamins and could be worth around $4.5 billion. The family-controlled drugmaker said on Tuesday it was considering selling the business, whose sales of over-the-counter medicines and vitamin supplements are about $1 billion a year, to help fund research into higher-margin prescription drugs.  It has already sounded out prospective buyers including Swiss food giant Nestle (NESN.S), three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday. But while preliminary talks were held over the summer with Nestle, which favored a joint venture deal, no agreement was reached, two of the sources added. The global market for consumer health products is worth an estimated $233 billion in sales this year, according to Euromonitor International, which ranks Merck’s business in the sector as the 32nd biggest, with a 0.4 percent share. One source said Merck was eyeing a price of 5 billion euros, while others said that 4 billion euros would be too ambitious because the business lacks global reach. Analysts at Bernstein have put a price tag of 3.7-5.6 billion euros on the business. Consumer health is very fragmented and has proved fertile ground for deals in recent years, as aging populations and health-conscious consumers drive demand. Nestle, which wants to become a “nutrition, health and wellness company,” recently said it would pursue opportunities to expand in the sector. Merck, which confirmed JP Morgan’s role but declined to comment on other aspects of the process, prefers an outright sale of the business, which owns brands such as Bion nutritional supplements and decongestant Nasivin, the sources said. But Nestle, which also declined to comment, could yet decide it wants to buy the whole business, they said. Two people familiar with the situation said Guggenheim Partners was also helping in the sales process. Merck and the boutique bank both declined to comment on its involvement. The German group said earlier this week it would give itself until early next year to make a decision on what to do with the business. Any delay might suit potential bidders such as Reckitt Benckiser, one of the sector’s biggest consolidators, which is digesting the $17 billion purchase of Mead Johnson.     Consumer company Procter & Gamble (PG.N) along with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), GSK (GSK.L), Takeda (4502.T) and Abbott (ABT.N) are all seen as other possible suitors. But Procter & Gamble is fighting off activist shareholder Trian, while Takeda has just bought Ariad. And U.S. drugmaker Pfizer (PFE.N) is not interested in bulking up in consumer health, a source familiar with the company’s strategy said. The company declined to comment.  Bayer (BAYGn.DE) has been largely ruled out because it is busy trying to get approval for its planned purchase of Monsanto (MON.N) while dealing with weakness at its own consumer care business. Sanofi (SASY.PA) is also seen as unlikely to bid because it is absorbed in folding Boehringer Ingelheim’s consumer care business into its organization after an asset swap.

613,PG,P&G;'s business structure takes center stage in Trian proxy fight,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Trian Partners, the activist fund seeking a seat on Procter & Gamble Co’s (PG.N) board, stepped up its criticism of the company’s business structure on Tuesday, a day after P&G;’s chief executive attacked Trian’s proposed reorganization as “dangerous.”  Trian last week released a 94-page plan to boost shares of the consumer products giant, ahead of the Oct. 10 shareholder vote on whether to elect fund co-founder Nelson Peltz as a P&G; director. P&G;, the maker of Crest toothpaste and Gillette razors and which has a market value of $232 billion, is fighting to keep Peltz off the board. Reorganizing P&G; into three global business units (GBUs) with presidents of each unit solely responsible, is central to Trian’s plan to boost the company’s stock price, a stance it reinforced on Tuesday.  Speaking at the CNBC Delivering Alpha event, Trian co-founder and chief investment officer Ed Garden cited P&G;’s president of Greater China selling and market operations, Matthew Price, to illustrate Trian’s criticism that accountability is unclear across the company’s existing GBUs.    “If sales really reports to GBUs, then which GBU does he report to?” Garden asked, referring to Price and demanding that P&G; answer the question in writing.  Garden went on to ask if the reporting lines really demonstrate accountability. “Everyone in the audience knows that if it’s a dotted line with someone reporting to you and you don’t control their compensation, then it’s a canard,” Garden said. Trian is P&G;’s fifth largest shareholder, owning 1.5 percent of the stock. P&G; has said it already underwent a reorganization, dividing the company into 16 business units across six regions. CEO David Taylor highlighted the new organization at a Barclays conference last week, laying out the new structure in a slide titled “simpler, faster, accountable.” On Monday, speaking to CNBC commentator Jim Cramer, Taylor  criticized Peltz’s proposed structure. “He’s proposed some things that could be very dangerous to the short term, which is reorganize the company right now,” Taylor said.

615,PG,P&G; investor Yacktman says to vote for adding Peltz to board,"(Reuters) - Investment advisory firm Yacktman Asset Management said it would support the addition of Trian Fund Management LP’s Nelson Peltz to Procter & Gamble Co’s board and criticized the company for engaging in “a costly and distracting proxy fight” with the activist investor. Peltz, whose fund is P&G;’s fifth-largest shareholder, has been locked in a prolonged battle with the maker of Gillette razors and Tide detergents and has been pushing for a seat on the company’s board. Yacktman said it owned $1.3 billion worth of P&G; shares and cited Peltz’s sizeable stake in P&G; and his experience with other consumer products companies for its support. “Current outside board members have no meaningful economic investment in the company’s success or failure,” Yacktman said in a letter to P&G;’s board on Thursday. P&G;, in response to Yacktman’s letter, said the company “did not ask for this proxy contest” and is committed to preventing anything from derailing the progress it is making in terms of its strategy and financial results. P&G; has argued that Peltz’s plan to boost shareholder value by organizing the company into three largely autonomous business units would result in higher costs, lower profits and another restructuring that could lead to a breakup of the company. “One voice on a board cannot upend a successful strategy,” Yacktman said in a letter to the company’s board, referring to P&G;’s argument that Peltz could derail the progress it has made. P&G;’s shareholders will vote on Oct. 10 on whether to add Peltz to the board.    Trian is the second activist fund in five years to target the consumer goods company. In 2012, Pershing Square Capital Management invested in P&G; and called for the ouster of its then chief executive, Robert McDonald. McDonald was replaced a year later, and in May 2014 Pershing exited the position. Trian was not immediately available for comment.

630,PG,P&G;'s Gillette sues Schick maker Edgewell over razor blade design,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co’s (PG.N) Gillette unit on Monday sued the maker of Schick razors for the second time in 13 months, seeking to stop its sale of razor blade cartridges designed to fit Gillette’s Fusion handles. Gillette filed its latest lawsuit against Edgewell Personal Care Co (EPC.N) roughly six months after slashing razor prices an average of 12 percent to keep rivals such as Schick, Harry’s and Dollar Shave Club from cutting into its still-dominant market share for men’s razors and blades. In a complaint filed in the federal court in New Haven, Connecticut, Gillette said Schick willfully infringed its 2015 patent for a removable shaving cartridge assembly by designing Hydro Connect 5 and Hydro Connect 5 Sensitive cartridges to fit Fusion razor handles. Gillette said this has caused “irreparable harm” and justifies that Edgewell pay royalties and triple damages. P&G; said it also filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to block Edgewell from importing infringing products from China. Edgewell declined to comment, saying it was still evaluating the complaint, which was filed in the early afternoon. The case was brought four months after Edgewell launched an online subscription service to sell Hydro Connect 5 cartridges that could fit Fusion handles, and Hydro Connect 3 cartridges that could fit Gillette’s Mach3 handles. Gillette separately sued Edgewell in August 2016, claiming it falsely marketed a line of private label three-blade razors and cartridges as being “as good or better than Mach3.” The companies settled later that year, and the lawsuit was dismissed, according to court records. Edgewell was spun off in July 2015 by battery maker Energizer Holdings Inc (ENR.N) and is based in Chesterfield, Missouri, though it has offices in Connecticut.

633,PG,"P&G;, Peltz vie for small investor votes in biggest-ever proxy fight","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The largest corporate proxy fight in history, between Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) and activist investor Nelson Peltz, may ultimately be decided by small shareholders like Tom Neubecker. The Cincinnati retiree is among the company’s vast army of individual stock owners that collectively hold about 40 percent of the consumer goods giant, a much higher proportion than at most big companies. The majority of votes for or against the nomination of Peltz, chief executive and founding partner of Trian Partners,  to P&G;’s board will be cast by massive index investors such as Vanguard Group Inc and BlackRock Inc (BLK.N). But small shareholders could tip the balance in a tight vote.  As a result, both P&G; and Trian are spending unprecedented amounts of money and effort courting Neubecker and his fellow retail holders; by email, old-fashioned paper mail and even social media.  Like most individual shareholders who vote in corporate elections, Neubecker is backing management.  “A lot of us have the fear that if Peltz is successful, he will break up the company and cut back retiree benefits,” said Neubecker, 66, who keeps tabs on the P&G; proxy fight through an email group called “PNGeezers,” made up of around 2,000 company retirees.  Opposition from shareholders like Neubecker represents an uphill struggle for Trian, which wants to streamline the maker of Crest toothpaste and Gillette razors into three autonomous units, which the fund says will allow the company to react faster to market changes.  P&G;, with a market value of $235 billion, has rejected that idea, saying its recent global reorganization is already creating value. Trian, where Peltz is CEO and co-founder, disclosed a $3.5 billion stake in P&G; in February. The firm nominated Peltz to the board in July and put forward its strategic plan last month. P&G; rejected the election of Peltz to the board as an unnecessary disruption. Trian has said it is not seeking to break up P&G; or cut pension benefits. Nevertheless, Neubecker said he already voted online in favor of his former employer, ahead of P&G;’s Oct. 10 annual meeting when the final votes will be counted. Out of six small P&G; investors contacted by Reuters, four said they would vote with management.  Trian lost a proxy fight against industrial conglomerate DuPont in 2015, which the fund blamed on failing to win over large index funds and small investors.  DuPont “clearly did a better job with the retail shareholder,” Peltz told reporters after the vote. This time around, with even more small investors in play, Trian does not want to make the same mistake.  Neubecker said he has seen several ads on his Facebook feed that link to Trian’s “Revitalize P&G;” website and to videos of Peltz and former P&G; Chief Financial Officer Clayton Daley, who is advising Trian.  The video of Peltz features him sitting in Trian’s Park Avenue, New York City headquarters, discussing P&G;’s future, gripping a Trian-labeled coffee mug that reads “Sales up, expenses down.”     In response, P&G; has called upon more than a century of product marketing experience with its own “Vote Blue” campaign. One YouTube video begins with an image of P&G;’s blue logo and a banner proclaiming “Every Single Vote Matters!”. A narrator and series of slick images offer step-by-step instructions, ending by asking viewers to vote for the blue proxy card and to throw Trian’s white card in the recycling bin.  It is not yet clear how effective the campaigns will be. “Social media can definitely get you closer to the retail shareholder in a proxy fight,” said Waheed Hassan at Alliance Advisors, which consults companies on mergers and proxy fights.  Grabbing shareholders’ attention and getting them to vote is a massive undertaking. Retail investors own 40 percent of P&G;’s stock, or 1.1 billion shares, according to the company, more than DuPont’s entire outstanding shares at the time of its proxy fight.  P&G;’s larger-than-normal retail base is due, in part, to long-running stock-based incentive plans for employees and the attraction of its well-known brand names for “mom and pop” investors.  Of the 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, P&G; has the fifth-largest retail investor base, according to data from research firm Proxy Insight, which tallied retail and insider holdings of each company. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, with a large portion of insider holdings, tops that list.  To reach retail investors, P&G; has dispatched at least five mailings while Trian has sent at least three since the campaign started last month.  “The intent of both sides is very clear,” said Frank Rhodes, 84, who retired from P&G; in 1989 and lives in Crestview Hills, Kentucky, a short drive from the company’s Cincinnati, Ohio headquarters. “I just don’t understand why they’re sending all of this mail.” Since August, Rhodes and his wife, who also worked at P&G;, have received hundreds of pages of proxy materials and more than 30 blue and white proxy cards - thanks to multiple stock accounts within the family.      Rhodes, who mailed in his vote for management, said he has also received a Facebook message and two phone calls from each side. Trian was first to get its proxy materials cleared by securities regulators, in July, giving it a slight head start on its campaign and the right to use a white proxy voting card, a color usually offered by management. The white card may appeal to retail investors, who often side with a company out of a sense of loyalty, and could even be mistaken for the P&G; card, proxy experts said. “There is some strategic importance to the white card, so in that sense, Trian did kind of pick P&G;’s pocket,” said Damien Park of advisory firm Hedge Fund Solutions. Trian hit the Cincinnati media circuit early too, with Peltz giving interviews late in August, just prior to P&G;’s rollout of CEO David Taylor to the local press.  Both sides have to keep the pressure on until the end of the fight as shareholders can submit as many voting cards as they want but only the last one counts. Shareholder John Lame, who worked in P&G;’s finance department, said he voted online for Trian, swayed by Peltz’s industry experience. “Around one-third of the retail vote could change in the next few weeks,” said Lame, now CEO of Lenox Wealth Management in Cincinnati, which manages the money of around 250 area families. “As Trian has now made its case, people are saying, ‘These guys make sense.’” ",9252017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-procter-gamble-trian-investors/pg-peltz-vie-for-small-investor-votes-in-biggest-ever-proxy-fight-idUSKCN1C01CW

635,PG,"P&G;, Peltz vie for small investor votes in biggest-ever proxy fight","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The largest corporate proxy fight in history, between Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) and activist investor Nelson Peltz, may ultimately be decided by small shareholders like Tom Neubecker. The Cincinnati retiree is among the company’s vast army of individual stock owners that collectively hold about 40 percent of the consumer goods giant, a much higher proportion than at most big companies. The majority of votes for or against the nomination of Peltz, chief executive and founding partner of Trian Partners,  to P&G;’s board will be cast by massive index investors such as Vanguard Group Inc and BlackRock Inc (BLK.N). But small shareholders could tip the balance in a tight vote.  As a result, both P&G; and Trian are spending unprecedented amounts of money and effort courting Neubecker and his fellow retail holders; by email, old-fashioned paper mail and even social media.  Like most individual shareholders who vote in corporate elections, Neubecker is backing management.  “A lot of us have the fear that if Peltz is successful, he will break up the company and cut back retiree benefits,” said Neubecker, 66, who keeps tabs on the P&G; proxy fight through an email group called “PNGeezers,” made up of around 2,000 company retirees.  Opposition from shareholders like Neubecker represents an uphill struggle for Trian, which wants to streamline the maker of Crest toothpaste and Gillette razors into three autonomous units, which the fund says will allow the company to react faster to market changes.  P&G;, with a market value of $235 billion, has rejected that idea, saying its recent global reorganization is already creating value. Trian, where Peltz is CEO and co-founder, disclosed a $3.5 billion stake in P&G; in February. The firm nominated Peltz to the board in July and put forward its strategic plan last month. P&G; rejected the election of Peltz to the board as an unnecessary disruption. Trian has said it is not seeking to break up P&G; or cut pension benefits. Nevertheless, Neubecker said he already voted online in favor of his former employer, ahead of P&G;’s Oct. 10 annual meeting when the final votes will be counted. Out of six small P&G; investors contacted by Reuters, four said they would vote with management.  Trian lost a proxy fight against industrial conglomerate DuPont in 2015, which the fund blamed on failing to win over large index funds and small investors.  DuPont “clearly did a better job with the retail shareholder,” Peltz told reporters after the vote. This time around, with even more small investors in play, Trian does not want to make the same mistake.  Neubecker said he has seen several ads on his Facebook feed that link to Trian’s “Revitalize P&G;” website and to videos of Peltz and former P&G; Chief Financial Officer Clayton Daley, who is advising Trian.

649,PG,"UPDATE 1-Peltz says P&G; proxy fight ""dumb,"" will go down to wire","(Adds Breakingviews link) By Siddharth Cavale Oct 6 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble should not have bothered resisting activist investor Nelson Peltz’s push for a board seat, he said on Friday, promising to keep his shares in the consumer goods company even if he lost next week’s vote. Peltz said the company had wasted more than $100 million to keep him off the board, despite him having no intention of replacing any board member or Chief Executive David Taylor, and that the vote would be close. “This proxy fight is probably the dumbest thing I’ve ever been involved in,” Peltz told CNBC on Friday. One of the best known activist investors in corporate America, Peltz has amassed a $3.5 billion stake in P&G; through his firm Trian Fund Management. He has said he wants the company to improve shareholder returns by speeding up a transformation begun in 2014 and further streamlining its operations, moves he hopes he can push with a board seat. He has also repeatedly said that P&G; has a “suffocating bureaucracy” that is stalling progress and that reorganizing the company into three global business units would reduce complexity. “P&G; has lost its soul,” Peltz said. With a $235 billion market capitalization, the Oct. 10 vote makes P&G; the biggest company to ever face a proxy fight, in which competing groups battle for the shareholder votes needed to gain control. P&G; in a statement on Friday reiterated its stance that Peltz was not a right fit for the board, particularly at a time when the company was in the final stages of its transformation. “Peltz’s timing is late to P&G;’s turnaround,” the company said in the statement. ",10062017,http://www.reuters.com/article/procterandgamble-trian/update-1-peltz-says-pg-proxy-fight-dumb-will-go-down-to-wire-idUSL4N1MH3B0
650,PG,Breakingviews - Cox: P&G; counting on an investor electoral college,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Procter & Gamble is counting on a variation of America’s electoral arithmetic as its best hope for keeping Nelson Peltz off the board of directors. There’s no particularly good reason for shareholders to deny the pushy investor, whose hedge fund Trian Partners owns 1.5 percent of the $235 billion diapers-to-shampoo conglomerate, a seat at the table. Yet as at the ballot box, a combination of voter apathy and arcane rules is likely to leave three investors holding all the cards at next Tuesday’s annual meeting. It is an irony of the way American public equity markets have developed that the most important deciders on the P&G; saga – as in many other proxy battles involving the world’s most valuable companies – are so-called passive index-fund managers led by Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. To further the imperfect political analogy, they play roles similar to the ones Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania did in helping put Donald Trump into the Oval Office, even though his rival Hillary Clinton achieved more of the popular vote last November. There are differences, of course. P&G; shareholders are not being offered a choice between one chief executive or another. The question of whether to give Peltz, who comes armed with ideas about how P&G; can improve its performance and more experience in the sector than most if not all of the company’s sitting directors, is far from existential. He would be one of about a dozen people helping set strategy, compensation and the like. Handing him a board seat is pretty much a no-lose option on bettering the maker of Tide and Pampers. The insular, Cincinnati-based company thinks differently. P&G;’s notorious allegiance to internal candidates for nearly every high-level position makes it vulnerable to criticism that it does not like outsiders telling it what to do. That’s a central theme to Peltz’s charges of P&G;’s underperformance. For its part, the giant led by David Taylor says it’s already on track to create a “profoundly different, much stronger, and more profitable company” than just a few years ago. As in previous engagements, Peltz is apt to have won over most of those P&G; investors who spend their days thinking about whether to keep the investment in their portfolio. These so-called active managers, a group that in P&G;’s case includes hedge funds, mutual funds and some pension funds, tend to agree that corporate boards benefit from having a voice from the investor community in their midst. Since P&G;’s board before Peltz jolted it into action had no such representative, they consider his pitch favorably. “Peltz’s experience in the consumer product space will add value to P&G;’s board and his significant stake in the company will bring an owner’s perspective inside the boardroom,” said Anne Sheehan, the director of corporate governance at CalSTRS, on Thursday. “The addition of Mr. Peltz to the board is best for P&G;, the CalSTRS fund and ultimately, the teachers of California.” It’s here where the electoral math starts to matter. P&G; has about 2.6 billion shares outstanding. Proxy advisers working either side of the tussle roughly estimate that investors like CalSTRS, Fidelity and Capital Group own about 41 percent of those shares. Assume 90 percent of the active managers live up to their billing and vote. If 80 percent of them tilt in favor of Peltz, that would give Trian about 770 million votes. Retail investors own about the same amount of P&G;, however. They tend to go along with what management has told them to do in the proxy cards that arrive in the post, as Trian learned the hard way when it failed to garner enough support to win seats on the board of DuPont two years ago. Like the American electorate, this group doesn’t tend to vote the way Fidelity and other institutions do. P&G; may have an extra edge, though, in that many of its former workers still hold the stock, or received it as part of their retirement. Yet there may also be folks who own the stock because, say, they love Dawn dishwashing liquid or live in the Cincinnati area and worry that Peltz would move its headquarters to the Bronx. So for arithmetic purposes, assume a slightly higher 60 percent of retail shareholders vote, and 80 percent of them cast their ballot against Peltz. That would give P&G; 515 million votes. That’s obviously not enough, and explains the significance of Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. They have been the biggest beneficiaries of a trend toward investing in funds that simply track benchmark indexes like the S&P; 500 – and charge lower fees for doing so – at the expense of higher-cost managers. Together, the trio control more than 17 percent of P&G;, according to Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisory firm that favors Peltz’s proposal.

651,PG,Cox: P&G; counting on an investor electoral college,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Procter & Gamble is counting on a variation of America’s electoral arithmetic as its best hope for keeping Nelson Peltz off the board of directors. There’s no particularly good reason for shareholders to deny the pushy investor, whose hedge fund Trian Partners owns 1.5 percent of the $235 billion diapers-to-shampoo conglomerate, a seat at the table. Yet as at the ballot box, a combination of voter apathy and arcane rules is likely to leave three investors holding all the cards at next Tuesday’s annual meeting. It is an irony of the way American public equity markets have developed that the most important deciders on the P&G; saga – as in many other proxy battles involving the world’s most valuable companies – are so-called passive index-fund managers led by Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. To further the imperfect political analogy, they play roles similar to the ones Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania did in helping put Donald Trump into the Oval Office, even though his rival Hillary Clinton achieved more of the popular vote last November. There are differences, of course. P&G; shareholders are not being offered a choice between one chief executive or another. The question of whether to give Peltz, who comes armed with ideas about how P&G; can improve its performance and more experience in the sector than most if not all of the company’s sitting directors, is far from existential. He would be one of about a dozen people helping set strategy, compensation and the like. Handing him a board seat is pretty much a no-lose option on bettering the maker of Tide and Pampers. The insular, Cincinnati-based company thinks differently. P&G;’s notorious allegiance to internal candidates for nearly every high-level position makes it vulnerable to criticism that it does not like outsiders telling it what to do. That’s a central theme to Peltz’s charges of P&G;’s underperformance. For its part, the giant led by David Taylor says it’s already on track to create a “profoundly different, much stronger, and more profitable company” than just a few years ago. As in previous engagements, Peltz is apt to have won over most of those P&G; investors who spend their days thinking about whether to keep the investment in their portfolio. These so-called active managers, a group that in P&G;’s case includes hedge funds, mutual funds and some pension funds, tend to agree that corporate boards benefit from having a voice from the investor community in their midst. Since P&G;’s board before Peltz jolted it into action had no such representative, they consider his pitch favorably. “Peltz’s experience in the consumer product space will add value to P&G;’s board and his significant stake in the company will bring an owner’s perspective inside the boardroom,” said Anne Sheehan, the director of corporate governance at CalSTRS, on Thursday. “The addition of Mr. Peltz to the board is best for P&G;, the CalSTRS fund and ultimately, the teachers of California.” It’s here where the electoral math starts to matter. P&G; has about 2.6 billion shares outstanding. Proxy advisers working either side of the tussle roughly estimate that investors like CalSTRS, Fidelity and Capital Group own about 41 percent of those shares. Assume 90 percent of the active managers live up to their billing and vote. If 80 percent of them tilt in favor of Peltz, that would give Trian about 770 million votes. Retail investors own about the same amount of P&G;, however. They tend to go along with what management has told them to do in the proxy cards that arrive in the post, as Trian learned the hard way when it failed to garner enough support to win seats on the board of DuPont two years ago. Like the American electorate, this group doesn’t tend to vote the way Fidelity and other institutions do. P&G; may have an extra edge, though, in that many of its former workers still hold the stock, or received it as part of their retirement. Yet there may also be folks who own the stock because, say, they love Dawn dishwashing liquid or live in the Cincinnati area and worry that Peltz would move its headquarters to the Bronx. So for arithmetic purposes, assume a slightly higher 60 percent of retail shareholders vote, and 80 percent of them cast their ballot against Peltz. That would give P&G; 515 million votes. That’s obviously not enough, and explains the significance of Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. They have been the biggest beneficiaries of a trend toward investing in funds that simply track benchmark indexes like the S&P; 500 – and charge lower fees for doing so – at the expense of higher-cost managers. Together, the trio control more than 17 percent of P&G;, according to Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisory firm that favors Peltz’s proposal. To beat back Peltz, P&G; needs to make up the difference between the active and retail investors, of some 255 million shares. In this scenario, P&G; can only make that happen by bringing all three to its side. Vanguard, with 181 million shares, is the largest. State Street and BlackRock own 115 million and 156 million, respectively, according to ISS. To put it another way, Peltz just has to win one of the three.

Peltz said that the company had wasted more than $100 million to keep him off the board, despite him having no intention of replacing any board member or Chief Executive David Taylor, and that the vote would be close. “This proxy fight is probably the dumbest thing I’ve ever been involved in,” Peltz told CNBC on Friday.

He has also repeatedly said that the company has a “suffocating bureaucracy” that is stalling progress and that reorganizing the company into three global business units would reduce complexity. “P&G; has lost its soul,” Peltz said. With a $235 billion market capitalization, the Oct. 10 vote makes Procter & Gamble the biggest ever firm to face a proxy fight - where two competing groups battle for the shareholder votes needed to control and change companies.  P&G; in a statement on Friday reiterated its stance that Peltz wasn’t a right fit for the board, particularly at this time as the company was in the final stages of its transformation.  “Peltz’s timing is late to P&G;’s turnaround,” the company said in the statement.

656,PG,GE names hedge fund Trian executive Ed Garden to board,"(Reuters) - U.S. industrial conglomerate General Electric Co, which major shareholder Trian Fund Management has been pressuring to conduct a more thorough restructuring, appointed the hedge fund’s chief investment officer to its board on Monday. Edward Garden will replace Robert Lane, who is retiring due to health reasons after a dozen years as a director, GE said in a statement. The surprise move comes one day before shareholders at consumer products company Procter & Gamble Co will decide whether to elect Trian Chief Executive Nelson Peltz to its board. Trian, which invests $14 billion in assets for pension funds, endowments and wealthy investors, has owned a roughly 1 percent stake in GE since 2015. Four months ago, GE said longtime CEO Jeff Immelt would step down and that John Flannery, a 30-year company veteran who had run its healthcare business, would succeed him. The company’s lackluster stock performance was seen to have prompted Immelt’s departure, which came months before analysts had expected, but the shares have continued to fall. They were down 3 percent in Monday morning trading.  “Like other GE shareholders, I am disappointed by the recent performance of GE’s stock,” Garden said in a statement. “But I continue to believe that GE represents an attractive long-term investment opportunity with significant upside.” The most recent wave of executive departures was announced last week and includes Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Bornstein. Jamie Miller, CEO of GE Transportation, will become CFO next month. Although Trian is an activist investor that demands change at companies, it is also known for working behind the scenes with management to improve performance. It rarely pushes out a CEO the way some other activists do, and it often sticks around, often for years, as transformations occur.  After discussions with Trian, GE in March set a $2 billion cost-reduction target and linked the bonuses of its senior management to meeting profit-related goals. As a board member at Bank of New York Mellon Corp, Garden most recently helped hire former Visa Inc CEO Charles Scharf to replace Gerald Hassell, who is retiring. Garden is also a board member of Pentair Plc. Since its 2005 inception, Trian has returned an average 8 percent a year to investors, according to data from HSBC Holdings Plc’s hedge fund investment arm.

659,PG,Peltz's Procter & Gamble defeat could be more humbling than harmful,"(Reuters) - Nelson Peltz put his activist hedge fund credentials on the line to win a board seat at Procter & Gamble Co, only to be narrowly defeated, according to a preliminary shareholder vote count. Yet he stands to lose more face than he does money. Peltz, CEO of Trian Fund Management, was also rebuffed in a battle for board seats, or proxy contest, at DuPont two years ago. But he went on to attract more money from investors and have a key ally installed as the chemical maker’s new chief executive. Trian said on Tuesday that the shareholder vote at P&G;, the biggest company to ever face a proxy contest, was too close to call, and that it would wait for the result to be certified by an independent inspector. P&G; says Peltz has lost. But if Peltz’s defeat is confirmed, there is little evidence it would cost him with his investors, industry analysts and academics said. “Overall, Nelson Peltz has a good record and he does work hard to improve companies,” said University of Michigan professor Erik Gordon. “He will have no trouble finding companies where improvements need to be made and where he’ll be let in the door.” Trian’s assets under management are at an all-time high of $14 billion, the result of long-standing confidence by pension funds and endowments in Trian’s 12-year investment history. There was no sign on Tuesday of significant redemptions by Trian investors.  Indeed, Trian got a boost this week from another big U.S. conglomerate, when General Electric Co offered a board seat to Trian chief investment officer Ed Garden, without any proxy contest. To be sure, Trian was eager for a win at P&G.; Trian’s 2.1 percent return through the end of September trails the average activist hedge fund’s 4.8 percent gain this year. And it lags last year’s 11 percent return.  Trian prefers to work behind the scenes and has only waged three proxy contests since its founding in 2005. It now looks to have lost two of them, and joins a small club of activist hedge funds that have experienced such defeat. They include Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management, Barry Rosenstein’s Jana Partners and Jeff Smith’s Starboard Value.  In the investment community, 75-year old Peltz, who speaks in calm tones and steers clear of the name-calling often heard in other contests, was thought to be the only activist who could take on P&G; and its entrenched management. However, the 180-year-old company, which makes Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste and Gillette razors, always presented a challenging target for Peltz because an unusually high 40 percent of P&G;’s stock is held by individual investors. They include P&G; employees and retirees, who are traditionally loyal to the company’s management. “Even if they win, which I’m not sure they did, think of what a pyrrhic victory it is,” Peltz told CNBC on Tuesday. “I mean everybody but the current employees voted for us up and down the line.” P&G; cannot afford to ignore Peltz even if victory has eluded him on this vote, said Charles Elson, a professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware. “In many ways, this could echo what happened at DuPont, where within the year, the CEO was out and the things Trian called for were happening,” he said.   On Tuesday P&G;’s share price fell, closing down 0.5 percent,  as investors worried whether the company would let up on its promises to pursue operational reforms. P&G; has said that management is already working on several operational changes, and that Peltz does not have the relevant experience to be helpful in the process. Investor pressure could still deliver change, industry insiders said. “Winning the ‘war’ will be measured in the share price creation over time,” said Bruce Goldfarb, founder of Okapi Partners, which advises on proxy contests.

660,PG,"Procter & Gamble foresees proxy war victory, Peltz refuses to concede","(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) said on Tuesday activist hedge fund manager Nelson Peltz lost his fight to win a seat on the company’s board, according to a preliminary tally of shareholder votes in the biggest and most expensive proxy contest ever. Peltz, whose Trian Fund Management LP owns a $3.5 billion stake in the world’s largest consumer products maker by market capitalization, refused to concede defeat, saying the vote was too close to call before the certified results are released. Sources said the difference in for and against votes for Peltz’s board director nomination was well within one percentage point. An independent inspector is expected to review and certify the votes this month and Trian could then legally  challenge the result. “We anticipate Peltz, who has taken issue with the firm’s organizational structure, corporate governance, and recent financial performance, to contest the vote,” Morningstar analyst Erin Lash said.   If the outcome is confirmed, it would be a bruising loss for Peltz, given that P&G; sought to turn the proxy contest into a referendum on his credentials as a seasoned executive in the consumer sector, with board director experience at Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O). Peltz had called for the maker of Pampers diapers, Gillette razors and Tide laundry detergent to reorganize into three business units: beauty, grooming and healthcare; fabric and home care and baby, feminine and family care. P&G;, led by Chief Executive David Taylor, countered that management is already working on several operational changes, and that Peltz does not have the relevant experience to be helpful in the process. “I shook (Peltz’s) hand, he shook my hand, and we said that just like we have through this proxy contest... folks want to make it a fight, but it is about ideas and the future. I told Nelson I will continue to listen to him as I have throughout this,” Taylor told a news conference after the shareholder meeting. P&G; shares were down 1 percent at $91.12 in afternoon trading in New York, giving the company a market capitalization of $232 billion. Its shares have risen 8.3 percent year-to-date, roughly in line with the S&P; 500 Household Products Index .SPLRCPROD, which is up 8.5 percent. Peltz was widely seen as the favorite to win the contest, because he had the backing of all three top shareholder advisory firms, which recommend how mutual funds should cast their vote, and was only seeking one board seat on P&G;’s 11-member board. “Win or lose, Nelson Peltz has taken the activist campaign to the largest companies, which have previously been able to inoculate themselves from these kind of experiences by spending enough money to keep activists at bay,” said Bruce Goldfarb, founder of Okapi Partners, which advises on proxy contests. Several activist shareholders have won a seat on the boards of companies over the years by arguing there was no harm in them bringing onboard a fresh perspective. Trian’s defeat could embolden corporate America to push back more against activists. The two sides collectively spent more than an estimated $100 million on mailings, phone calls and advertisements to woo investors.  Vanguard Group Inc, State Street Global Advisors and BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) are P&G;’s top three shareholders. State Street and BlackRock sided with Peltz, but Vanguard backed P&G;, according to sources familiar with the matter.  Individual stock owners, such as retirees and amateur stock pickers, collectively hold about 40 percent of the company’s stock, a much higher proportion than at most big companies. P&G;’s large retail base is due, in part, to long-running stock-based incentive plans for employees and the attraction of its well-known brand names for “mom and pop” investors. Analysts said this large pool of individual stock owners played a big part in Trian’s apparent defeat. They comprise mostly of P&G; employees and retirees, who are loyal to management and can be wary of Wall Street’s intentions. “At P&G;, the proxy advisers are not going to have the same sway over retail investors,” said Jill Fisch, a University of Pennsylvania Law School professor who follows corporate governance.  This is only the third time Trian has waged a proxy contest in its 12-year history. Two years ago it narrowly lost a fight with DuPont, although within a year the company’s CEO was out a job and a faster cost cutting was underway.

661,PG,US STOCKS-Wal-Mart rally pushes Dow to all-time high,"(Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a record high on Tuesday, helped by a surge in Wal-Mart Stores, while Amazon and Facebook lost ground and investors focused on upcoming quarterly reports. Wal-Mart (WMT.N) jumped 4.47 percent to a two-year high after forecasting U.S. online sales would rise by about 40 percent in the next fiscal year and unveiling a $20-billion share buyback. That helped the S&P; 500 consumer staples index .SPLRCS jump 0.99 percent, although gains in that sector were limited by P&G; (PG.N), which dropped 0.54 percent after activist investor Nelson Peltz unexpectedly failed in his bid to win a board seat. Third-quarter corporate reporting season kicks into high gear on Thursday with results from JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N). With the S&P; 500 up 14 percent in 2017, investors are betting on strong earnings growth across the S&P; 500.  Wall Street has mostly shrugged off recent saber-rattling between the United States and North Korea, as well as a lack of progress by President Donald Trump in delivering promised corporate tax cuts. “The only fear in this market is the fear of missing out,” said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. “But things can change quickly. There’s stuff out there, like North Korea. You still have to be cautious.”  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 0.31 percent to 22,830.68 points, a record-high close. It is up 15.5 percent in 2017. The S&P; 500 .SPX gained 0.23 percent to 2,550.64 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.11 percent to 6,587.25. The tech index .SPLRCT, the best performing among the 11 major S&P; sectors this year, was mostly unchanged, with Facebook falling 0.53 percent and Nvidia (NVDA.O) adding 1.91 percent after unveiling chips for autonomous vehicles, bringing its gain over the past year to 182 percent. American Airlines (AAL.O) jumped 4.80 percent and United Continental (UAL.N) soared 4.67 percent after the two airlines gave encouraging third-quarter forecasts. Delta (DAL.N), which reports on Wednesday, rose 1.85 percent. Energy stocks .SPNY got a boost from a near 2-percent rise in oil prices supported by Saudi Arabian export cuts in November and comments from OPEC and trading companies that the market is rebalancing after years of oversupply. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.90-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.58-to-1 ratio favored advancers. About 5.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, well below the 6.1 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

P&G;, led by Chief Executive David Taylor, countered that management is already working on several operational changes, and that Peltz does not have the relevant experience to be helpful in the process. “I shook (Peltz’s) hand, he shook my hand, and we said that just like we have through this proxy contest... folks want to make it a fight, but it is about ideas and the future. I told Nelson I will continue to listen to him as I have throughout this,” Taylor told a news conference after the shareholder meeting. P&G; shares were down 1 percent at $91.12 in afternoon trading in New York, giving the company a market capitalization of $232 billion. Its shares have risen 8.3 percent year-to-date, roughly in line with the S&P; 500 Household Products Index .SPLRCPROD, which is up 8.5 percent. Peltz was widely seen as the favorite to win the contest, because he had the backing of all three top shareholder advisory firms, which recommend how mutual funds should cast their vote, and was only seeking one board seat on P&G;’s 11-member board. “Win or lose, Nelson Peltz has taken the activist campaign to the largest companies, which have previously been able to inoculate themselves from these kind of experiences by spending enough money to keep activists at bay,” said Bruce Goldfarb, founder of Okapi Partners, which advises on proxy contests. Several activist shareholders have won a seat on the boards of companies over the years by arguing there was no harm in them bringing onboard a fresh perspective. Trian’s defeat could embolden corporate America to push back more against activists. The two sides collectively spent more than an estimated $100 million on mailings, phone calls and advertisements to woo investors.  Vanguard Group Inc, State Street Global Advisors and BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) are P&G;’s top three shareholders. State Street and BlackRock sided with Peltz, but Vanguard backed P&G;, according to sources familiar with the matter.  Individual stock owners, such as retirees and amateur stock pickers, collectively hold about 40 percent of the company’s stock, a much higher proportion than at most big companies. P&G;’s large retail base is due, in part, to long-running stock-based incentive plans for employees and the attraction of its well-known brand names for “mom and pop” investors. Analysts said this large pool of individual stock owners played a big part in Trian’s apparent defeat. They comprise mostly of P&G; employees and retirees, who are loyal to management and can be wary of Wall Street’s intentions. “At P&G;, the proxy advisers are not going to have the same sway over retail investors,” said Jill Fisch, a University of Pennsylvania Law School professor who follows corporate governance.  This is only the third time Trian has waged a proxy contest in its 12-year history. Two years ago it narrowly lost a fight with DuPont, although within a year the company’s CEO was out a job and a faster cost cutting was underway.

Wal-Mart jumped more than 4 percent to a two-year high after forecasting U.S. online sales would rise by about 40 percent in the next fiscal year and unveiling a $20-billion share buyback plan. That helped the S&P; 500 consumer staples index jump 0.77 percent, although gains in that sector were limited by P&G;, which dropped 1.06 percent after activist investor Nelson Peltz unexpectedly failed in his bid to win a board seat. Third-quarter corporate reporting season kicks into high gear on Thursday with results from JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. With the S&P; 500 up 14 percent in 2017, investors are betting on strong earnings growth across the S&P; 500. Wall Street has mostly shrugged off recent saber-rattling between the United States and North Korea, as well as a lack of progress by President Donald Trump in delivering promised corporate tax cuts. “The only fear in this market is the fear of missing out,” said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. “But things can change quickly. There’s stuff out there, like North Korea. You still have to be cautious.” All three major indexes were off of earlier intra-day record highs. At 2:32 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 percent at 22,806.57 points, while the S&P; 500 had gained 0.15 percent to 2,548.46. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.03 percent to 6,577.63. The tech index, the best performing among the 11 major S&P; sectors this year, fell 0.14 percent, weighed down by Alphabet, Facebook and Intel.

American Airlines jumped 4.94 percent and United Continental soared 5.34 percent after the two airlines gave encouraging third-quarter forecasts. Delta, which reports on Wednesday, rose 2.45 percent. Energy stocks got a boost from a near 2-percent rise in oil prices supported by Saudi Arabian export cuts in November and comments from OPEC and trading companies that the market is rebalancing after years of oversupply. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.70-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.31-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Wal-Mart jumped more than 4 percent to a two-year high of $84.46 after forecasting U.S. online sales would rise by about 40 percent in the next fiscal year and unveiling a $20 billion share buyback plan.

The Nasdaq Composite was up 5.23 points, or 0.08 percent, at 6,584.96, pulling back from earlier highs due to a drop in Amazon and healthcare stocks. The gains in all three indexes come after two rather tepid days that slowed a near year-long rally driven by strong corporate earnings, hopes of tax cuts and looser regulations. But the rally has led to elevated valuations, which investors will look to justify through corporate profits in the upcoming third-quarter earnings season.

669,PG,Peltz's Procter & Gamble defeat could be more humbling than harmful,"(Reuters) - Nelson Peltz put his activist hedge fund credentials on the line to win a board seat at Procter & Gamble Co, only to be narrowly defeated, according to a preliminary shareholder vote count. Yet he stands to lose more face than he does money. Peltz, CEO of Trian Fund Management, was also rebuffed in a battle for board seats, or proxy contest, at DuPont two years ago. But he went on to attract more money from investors and have a key ally installed as the chemical maker’s new chief executive. Trian said on Tuesday that the shareholder vote at P&G;, the biggest company to ever face a proxy contest, was too close to call, and that it would wait for the result to be certified by an independent inspector. P&G; says Peltz has lost. But if Peltz’s defeat is confirmed, there is little evidence it would cost him with his investors, industry analysts and academics said. “Overall, Nelson Peltz has a good record and he does work hard to improve companies,” said University of Michigan professor Erik Gordon. “He will have no trouble finding companies where improvements need to be made and where he’ll be let in the door.” Trian’s assets under management are at an all-time high of $14 billion, the result of long-standing confidence by pension funds and endowments in Trian’s 12-year investment history. There was no sign on Tuesday of significant redemptions by Trian investors.  Indeed, Trian got a boost this week from another big U.S. conglomerate, when General Electric Co offered a board seat to Trian chief investment officer Ed Garden, without any proxy contest. To be sure, Trian was eager for a win at P&G.; Trian’s 2.1 percent return through the end of September trails the average activist hedge fund’s 4.8 percent gain this year. And it lags last year’s 11 percent return.  Trian prefers to work behind the scenes and has only waged three proxy contests since its founding in 2005. It now looks to have lost two of them, and joins a small club of activist hedge funds that have experienced such defeat. They include Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management, Barry Rosenstein’s Jana Partners and Jeff Smith’s Starboard Value.  In the investment community, 75-year old Peltz, who speaks in calm tones and steers clear of the name-calling often heard in other contests, was thought to be the only activist who could take on P&G; and its entrenched management. However, the 180-year-old company, which makes Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste and Gillette razors, always presented a challenging target for Peltz because an unusually high 40 percent of P&G;’s stock is held by individual investors. They include P&G; employees and retirees, who are traditionally loyal to the company’s management. “Even if they win, which I’m not sure they did, think of what a pyrrhic victory it is,” Peltz told CNBC on Tuesday. “I mean everybody but the current employees voted for us up and down the line.” P&G; cannot afford to ignore Peltz even if victory has eluded him on this vote, said Charles Elson, a professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware. “In many ways, this could echo what happened at DuPont, where within the year, the CEO was out and the things Trian called for were happening,” he said.   On Tuesday P&G;’s share price fell, closing down 0.5 percent,  as investors worried whether the company would let up on its promises to pursue operational reforms. P&G; has said that management is already working on several operational changes, and that Peltz does not have the relevant experience to be helpful in the process. Investor pressure could still deliver change, industry insiders said. “Winning the ‘war’ will be measured in the share price creation over time,” said Bruce Goldfarb, founder of Okapi Partners, which advises on proxy contests.

For one hour, the Wall Street hedge fund manager spoke in a live webinar, fielding questions from Main Street investors about ADP’s culture, the company’s earnings potential and what expertise he would bring, all while trying to soften his image of an impatient investor who likes to fire people. “This is your company and you get to decide,” Ackman said, urging retail investors to vote their shares. “The decision to vote your shares is as important as voting for president of the United States,” he said, before showing a short tutorial on exactly how to vote for him. The 51-year-old hedge fund manager is pushing ADP to cut bureaucracy, consolidate its real estate holdings and enhance technology, all to boost earnings. He is seeking control of three seats out of ADP’s board of 10. Ackman’s effort to reach retail investors illustrates just how critical this group, which owns 28 percent of ADP, is in determining the outcome of the battle between himself and the human-resources software company at the Nov. 7 vote. Ackman’s $10 billion hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, holds an 8.3 percent economic stake in ADP but has only a 2 percent voting stake. Until recently, retail investors have been largely ignored in proxy contests, partly because employees, retirees and amateur investors are often seen to side with management if they vote their shares at all. For Ackman, who has won and lost proxy battles, the stakes are high. While he has returned an average 15 percent a year over the last decade, his reputation has been hobbled by two years of double-digit losses in 2016 and 2015, and a number of prominent investors have pulled money out. The importance of retail investors was illustrated on Tuesday as another activist, Trian Fund Management’s Nelson Peltz, appears to have lost his bid for one seat on the board at Procter & Gamble Co. On the webinar, Ackman acknowledged mistakes like his bet on Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc, on which he took a more than $3 billion loss when he finally sold his stake. But he spent more time detailing achievements at Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd, Zoetis Inc and Air Products & Chemicals Inc, and laid out the amount of money he and the two other board candidates have riding on ADP’s future success. “We would have skin in the game,” Ackman said.

673,PG,Procter & Gamble says Peltz loses board seat bid by around 6 million votes,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) said on Monday that activist hedge fund manager Nelson Peltz had lost his bid to win a seat on the consumer goods company’s board by 6.15 million votes, according to its preliminary tally.  Peltz, whose Trian Fund Management LP owns a $3.5 billion stake in P&G;, has sought a board seat in one of the biggest and most expensive proxy contests ever. P&G; chief executive David Taylor said last week that Peltz had lost the fight, but Peltz said the vote was too close to call and was not conceding.  He had contested the existing seat of Ernesto Zedillo, the former president of Mexico. Peltz received 973.0 million votes, compared to Zedillo's 979.2 million votes, P&G; said in a filing. (bit.ly/2yt33t6) The results were preliminary estimates and subject to change based on certification by an independent firm, the maker of Pampers diapers and Gillette razors said. It is expected to take the independent firm weeks to deliver a final tally. The counting process is made difficult in this case because P&G; has a large number of individual investors and many of them voted their own shares instead of having brokerages who hold the shares do the voting. Peltz could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday.

675,PG,UPDATE 3-Nestle speeds up overhaul to counter slowest growth in decades,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Nestle (NESN.S), the world’s biggest packaged food group, is doubling spending on its restructuring this year to up to 1 billion Swiss francs ($1 billion) to cope with its weakest sales growth in more than two decades. Europe’s largest company by market value is under pressure to improve returns from activist investor Daniel Loeb, whose Third Point hedge fund revealed a $3.5 billion stake in June. It must also review its business model and brand portfolio to ensure its products stay appealing to consumers who often prefer fresh, local foods to Nestle’s Maggi soups or KitKat chocolate bars. Organic sales rose 3.1 percent in the third quarter, up from 2.4 percent in the second, in line with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll. Performance was helped by improved trading in Europe and Asia. Still, Nestle forecast growth for the full year around the 2.6 percent it generated for the first nine months, implying a slowdown in the fourth quarter and the year as a whole. Last year’s sales rose 3.2 percent. “Going forward, everyone is well advised to be cautious and you see that reflected in our expectations for the fourth quarter,” Chief Executive Mark Schneider said on Thursday.  Finance chief Francois-Xavier Roger cautioned that Europe and Asia might not be able to repeat the good performance over the final three months, but confirmed Nestle’s goal of returning to mid-single-digit organic growth by 2020. Nestle said it would spend up to 1 billion Swiss francs this year on restructuring, double its initial plan, as it seeks to cut structural costs, such as by closing factories, boosting efficiency and sourcing globally. Yet its overall forecast for restructuring costs of 2.5 billion francs between 2016 and 2020 remained unchanged. The acceleration will reduce this year’s operating margin by 0.4 to 0.6 percentage point, while the underlying margin — before restructuring costs — is expected to rise by at least 0.2 percentage point in constant currency, Nestle said. Nestle last month set a target for the underlying margin to reach 17.5-18.5 percent by 2020, up from 16.0 percent in 2016. Slowing growth rates at packaged food groups have sparked the interest of activist investors, with Procter & Gamble (PG.N) also becoming a target recently. Unilever (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS) reported lower-than-expected third-quarter sales on Thursday, losing market share to smaller competitors and dampening hopes that an aborted takeover offer from Kraft Heinz (KHC.O) would spark a swift improvement. Nestle shares were 0.8 percent lower at 1530 GMT, slightly lagging the European sector .SX3P.  They have gained 16 percent so far this year and are trading at 28.3 times forward earnings, according to Reuters data, at a premium to Danone at 24.2 times and Unilever at 25.8 times.  Analysts said Nestle’s performance was disappointing when compared to Danone that saw strong baby food sales in China boost growth in the third quarter to 4.7 percent.

679,PG,Gillette weakens P&G; report after Peltz row,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) disappointed Wall Street with sales on Friday, hurt by continuing weakness in its Gillette business,  a week after it claimed to have fought off hedge-fund manager Nelson Peltz’s move to muscle onto the board.   P&G;, which spent millions battling Peltz’s charges of bureaucratic and ineffective management, reported higher sales of beauty and home care products. But a third straight quarter of declines in the grooming business that sells Gillette razors and Braun epilators weakened overall growth. Net sales in the firm’s first quarter results rose just 1 percent to $16.65 billion, missing analysts’ expectations of $16.69 billion and driving shares 3.5 percent lower in afternoon trading in New York. The stock had been up 9 percent so far this year. “The quarter was a little bit more challenging. ..than we would have expected going in with the run up of commodity cost and the impact of the natural disasters,” P&G; Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a call with analysts pointing to higher shipping costs in many geographies.  The world’s biggest household products maker has been losing market share to upstarts like Unilever’s (ULVR.L) Dollar Shave Club and has cut prices to try and shore up its men’s personal care business. “Grooming was especially weak,” RBC Capital markets analyst Nik Modi said noting that was steeper than his own estimate of a 2 percent decline. Moeller said price cuts that have averaged at about 12 percent, caused the weakness in the value of sales in grooming. Weakness in Brazil also had a big impact, as consumers spent less amid an ongoing recession. Stagnant sales are one of the issues Peltz had with P&G; in his contentious and very public proxy fight for a seat on the company’s 11-member board.  Preliminary voting results show he lost the fight - the biggest and most expensive in U.S. corporate history - by a hair. His New York-based Trian Fund Management have said they will contest the vote and would not concede until an independent arbiter had certified the count.        P&G; said it was maintaining its full-year organic sales and adjusted profit forecast. But it also said it expects a $300 million hit from commodity costs, in part due to the hurricanes that battered the southern U.S. this year.

Bank of America jumped 1.8 percent and Goldman Sachs rose 1 percent, trailing a rise in U.S. Treasury yields and Apple’s 0.8 percent gain led the recovery in technology stocks. Hopes of tax cuts have helped the market rally, as companies expect the move to lift economic growth and inflation. The Senate on Thursday approved a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year that will pave the way for Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic support. “It clearly is a positive and has added to the sentiment,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. “Any legislative action that promotes economic growth, clearly will be additive to not only sentiment but presumably earnings.” Third-quarter earnings season is under way and 183 S&P; 500 companies are expected to report earnings next week. So far more than 70 percent of the 88 S&P; 500 companies have beat profit expectations.

Seven of the 11 major S&P; indexes were higher, led by a 0.89 percent gain in the financial index. PayPal’s 4.8 percent rise after upbeat earnings also lifted the tech stocks.

689,PG,China shoppers rein in spending on cookies to pop drinks -survey,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Growth in sales of consumer goods ranging from biscuits and candies to toothpaste and shampoo has slowed in China to a five-year low, a survey shows, in a major challenge for global firms seeking to attract buyers in the world’s most populous nation. Demand for fast-moving consumer goods has waned in the world’s No.2 economy, with sales growing 2 percent in the first half of 2017 versus year-ago levels, a report from consultancies Kantar Worldpanel and Bain & Co shows.  That is the weakest half-year growth since 2012, according to the report based on a survey of 40,000 households. While sales rose 3.6 percent in the third quarter, it is still a far cry from a near 20 percent growth just over half a decade ago. The data gives a gauge of how China’s consumers are spending their money - key as Beijing’s leaders, global investors, and brands such as Nestle (NESN.S), Pampers owner Procter & Gamble (PG.N) or Coca-Cola (KO.N) look to tap the spending power of the country’s near 1.4 billion potential shoppers. “The type of consumption people enjoy now is very different - travel, lifestyle, entertainment are all growing strongly,” said Bruno Lannes, Shanghai-based partner at Bain. “(This is) where people are spending, and it’s taking money away from fast-moving consumer goods.” A boom in cheap food delivery - luring huge investment into firms like Meituan-Dianping - has also hit grocery sales as people cook less often at home, Lannes added. But not all products did badly. While chocolate, chewing gum and candy saw double-digit drops in sales volume in the first six months, health-focused products like yoghurt and bottled water and some personal care products fared far better. The Kantar-Bain report offers detailed insights into consumer spending patterns beyond broader official retail sales. The latter also includes data from segments like cars and oil products and showed a rise of 10.3 percent for September. China - amid a twice-a-decade leadership reshuffle - has posted strong economic growth this year, but this is expected to slow in coming months as higher financing costs and measures to cool the heated property market start to weigh on activity. The annual Kantar-Bain report also underlined how politics was hitting consumer markets.  Sales of South Korean skin care and makeup products in China fell 4.8 percent in the first half amid a diplomatic stand-off over Seoul’s decision to deploy an anti-missile system. For 2017, sales of fast-moving consumer goods in China is expected to be “slightly” better than last year’s 2.9 percent rise, which was the slowest in a decade, Kantar’s China General Manager Jason Yu said. “We did see some recovery in the third quarter,” said Yu. “Really important now is how the fourth quarter performs.” ",10242017,http://www.reuters.com/article/china-retail/china-shoppers-rein-in-spending-on-cookies-to-pop-drinks-survey-idUSL4N1MZ1VD

It showed the deal was signed off by just one official of the Dutch tax authority, where at least two signatures were required. The agreement also did not pass the special commission for international tax rulings, Dutch newspapers Trouw and Financieele Dagblad reported. In an emailed statement, P&G; said it “pays all the taxes it owes, worldwide, and we comply with the letter and spirit of the law everywhere we operate”. A spokesman for the finance ministry, which oversees the tax authority, declined to comment on the P&G; deal or on the consequences of the leak for other tax arrangements.

693,PG,"UPDATE 2-Dutch to review 4,000 ""advance tax rulings"" after P&G; blunder","AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Dutch government agreed on Wednesday to review 4,000 tax deals offered to international companies from 2012-2016 after being stung by leaks that show it failed to follow its own vetting procedures in a 2008 case involving Procter & Gamble (PG.N). Documents leaked in the so-called “Paradise Papers” trove of offshore records shed light on a previously undisclosed deal with the Dutch government that gave P&G; an estimated tax break of $169 million.  P&G;, the maker of Pampers diapers, Gillette razors and Tide laundry detergent, issued a statement on Tuesday denying involvement in any form of tax avoidance. And while there are no allegations the arrangement was in any way improper, the Dutch deputy minister for finance acknowledged in a letter to parliament on Tuesday that the deal, which was signed off on by a single inspector, should have been vetted by an entire team. “Not following prescribed procedures is unacceptable,” said Menno Snel in the letter. “Therefore I have given the order to investigate whether ... more than 4,000 international rulings were issued in conformity with the guidelines.” He said the investigation would be complete by year end.  The new Dutch government must walk a delicate line as it attempts to satisfy allies and critics it is taking steps to reform abusive tax practices - while at the same time defending its attractiveness as a place for multinationals to do business. Expertise on tax advice, consulting on legal structures, accountancy and legal counseling are all seen as key competencies for the Netherlands. But its reputation has been hurt by a wave of protectionist sentiment that had a hand in derailing a bid by U.S. paint maker PPG Industries for Dutch coatings and chemicals firm Akzo Nobel. The P&G; deal was an “Advance Price Agreement”, a deal wherein a tax authority approves in advance prices one branch of a company charges another when they do business. Multinationals value the certainty APAs and other advance tax rulings bring, while critics say they are often used to shift profits into zero tax jurisdictions.  Tax campaigners say that the Netherlands and Luxembourg specifically rubber-stamp such deals in order to attract investment and jobs. In addition, such deals are also often not available to smaller or less sophisticated firms. In 2015, the European Commission said the Netherlands had given Starbucks an unreasonably generous APA tax ruling, which helped encourage the company establish its European headquarters in the country. It ordered The Hague to recoup 30 million euros  ($35 million) from the company, a decision the government is contesting. According to data published by the European Commission, EU members granted 978 APAs to EU companies in 2015. The Netherlands granted 236 of these. Belgium gave 474 and Luxembourg granted 145. The Paradise Paper revelations come at an awkward time for the Dutch government, which said at its installation just last month it would take new measures to crack down on mailbox companies and combat use of the Netherlands as a conduit to tax havens. Among other measures, the country introduced a tax on royalties when payments are sent to low-tax jurisdictions. However, in an bid to win over companies seeking new EU bases once Britain leaves the bloc — which have so far mostly chosen bases elsewhere in Europe — Prime Minister Mark Rutte has announced a plan to scrap any withholding tax on dividends. The government has also promised to lower its tax rate to 21 percent from 25 percent to further woo foreign firms. “The cabinet is working to create an attractive environment that benefits companies with actual activities in the Netherlands, and is also tackling tax avoidance,” Snel said. The opposition Green Left party said the measures being adopted did not go far enough. “The Paradise Papers show that the Netherlands still plays a major role in global tax evasion,” Green Left lawmaker Tom van der Lee. The Paradise Papers are leaked documents from prominent offshore law firm Appleby that relate to the investments of wealthy individuals and institutions ranging from U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to Britain’s Queen Elizabeth.

699,PG,UPDATE 3-Nestle shakes up infant nutrition to tackle local rivals,"LONDON/ZURICH (Reuters) - Nestle (NESN.S), the world’s largest packaged food firm, said on Wednesday it would reorganize its infant nutrition business to improve performance, five months after the new CEO listed the category as one of its priorities for growth. The Swiss maker of Gerber baby food and Illuma formula will appoint regional managers for the business to address local trends faster. Rival Unilever (ULVR.L) took a similar step, with business heads for different countries. The changes come as global consumer goods groups like Nestle, Unilever and Procter & Gamble (PG.N) are under intense investor pressure to boost profit margins as sales slow from people migrating to smaller, independent brands. Infant nutrition is a key battleground for Nestle and its rivals Danone (DANO.PA) and Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L), which bought Enfamil infant formula maker Mead Johnson. Big established brands still retain consumer trust that they have lost in other areas of packaged food, particularly in China, a major focus for future growth due to growing affluence and a policy to allow two children per family instead of one. Nestle has come under pressure to shift gear from activist shareholder Third Point, which in June revealed a $3.5 billion stake. Nestle has satisfied some demands, such as by buying back shares and setting a margin target. Nestle said it would manage some areas of infant nutrition globally via a “strategic business unit” for innovation, quality management, compliance and global manufacturing capacity.  But it scrapped the role of a global nutrition head to be replaced by three regional business heads. Current Nutrition head Heiko Schipper leaves at the end of 2017, to lead Bayer AG’s (BAYGn.DE) consumer health unit. Nestle already manages most of its businesses regionally, with the exception of a few areas, such as bottled water, Nespresso, Nestle Health Science and Nestle Skin Health.     “The new organization will allow Nestle’s infant nutrition business to deliver accelerated organic growth and realize further efficiency gains,” Nestle said.  “The more agile and efficient structure will enable Nestle to respond faster to rapidly changing local consumer preferences, evolving regulation, and customer and channel demand for tailor-made solutions.” Nestle is the world’s biggest infant formula maker, with about 22 percent of the market last year, according to Euromonitor. It is also the leader in the key Chinese market, which is changing rapidly due to the rise of “mum and baby shops” and new federal regulations that go into effect in 2018. The market has temporarily slowed before implementation of the new rules as wholesalers and retailers reduce stocks, but Danone said strong sales in China contributed to a 4.7 percent rise in underlying third-quarter like-for-like sales. Nestle Chief Executive told investors in September that China’s two-child policy taking effect and a stronger focus on quality would help Nestle in China. “We are reasonably optimistic when it comes to 2018, 2019,” he said.     Schneider said in June he would focus the company’s capital spending on particular high-growth categories including coffee, petcare, bottled water and infant nutrition. The company also said Stefan Catsicas, its chief technology officer, was leaving “to pursue entrepreneurial and venture capital activities outside Nestle”. He will be replaced by Stefan Palzer at the start of the year. Stefan Palzer has been head of the Nestle Research Center since 2016. Nestle shares, up about 15 percent this year, were down slightly at 83.85 Swiss francs at 0908 GMT.

701,PG,"Trian's Peltz claims win in proxy fight, P&G; says not yet","(Reuters) - Activist hedge fund manager Nelson Peltz claimed victory in his fight to win a seat on Procter & Gamble Co’s (PG.N) board after a preliminary tally of votes was released on Wednesday, but P&G; refused to concede and said it wants to see a certified result before declaring a winner. Shares of P&G;, the world’s largest consumer products maker by market value, rose more than 3 percent in after-hours trading, indicating some investors welcome Peltz’s effort to shake up the company’s management and improve financial results. A new preliminary vote tally prepared by independent election inspector IVS Associates after four weeks of recounting from last month’s proxy contest showed Peltz won by 43,000 shares voted out of 2.6 billion, according to a source.  That leaves Peltz with a margin of victory of 0.002 percent of outstanding shares, which analysts said is so slim it could easily flip again. “Shareholders have voted, and they have indicated that they want Nelson Peltz to join the Board,” Peltz said in a statement where he urged the company to accept the inspector’s tabulation and “not waste further time and shareholder money contesting the outcome of the annual meeting.” P&G; said in a statement the results are still preliminary and “subject to a review and challenge period.” P&G; and Peltz’s Trian Fund Management, which has a $3.5 billion stake in the company, now both have the chance to recount the votes themselves and challenge the outcome, which means a resolution could still be weeks away. This phase of the contest is known as the “snakepit” in industry circles. IVS’s tally was delayed several times suggesting the inspector was being especially careful with this high-profile fight. The tally may also have taken longer because roughly 40 percent of P&G;’s shareholders are retail investors. The recount tally is an embarrassing setback for P&G; after the company claimed a narrow victory in last month’s vote. It is the latest twist in the largest proxy battle in history, in which the two sides collectively spent more than an estimated $100 million on mailings, phone calls and advertisements to woo investors. Erik Gordon, a law and business professor at the University of Michigan said if the vote holds and Peltz gets a seat, management will have to make changes more quickly. “Peltz won’t try to remove (the CEO), but Peltz won’t forget how much money he spent trying to bar the boardroom door. The pressure on the CEO to grow the business goes up and the timeline gets shorter.” For his part, Peltz said he would work collaboratively in the boardroom and said before the election he would propose bringing the incumbent director he beat back onto the board. Trian wages few proxy contests and lost two years ago at DuPont but within months the CEO was replaced.

709,PG,UPDATE 1-P&G; appoints Peltz to board despite losing proxy battle,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) said it appointed Nelson Peltz to its board despite the activist investor narrowly losing a months-long proxy fight, the biggest ever involving a U.S. company. The company’s shares were up 1 percent in after-market trading on Friday. Immediately after its annual meeting in mid-October, P&G; said it beat Peltz by a slim margin, but a preliminary tally by an independent election inspector, released a month later, showed otherwise. “Because the election results were so close, and because a large number of shareholders voted for Nelson Peltz to be a director, the board has engaged in numerous discussions with Mr. Peltz regarding a board seat,” P&G; said on Friday. The consumer goods conglomerate said it increased its board size by 2 to 13 - to accommodate Peltz and appoint a new director in Joseph Jimenez, CEO of drugmaker Novartis AG <NOV N.S>. P&G; said it had recounted nearly two billion votes, many of which were paper ballots.   The recount showed that shareholders elected all eleven P&G; nominees, including Ernesto Zedillo, for whom the votes cast were extremely close to those for Peltz.  Following recent discussions, Peltz and P&G; agreed that the company would not be predisposed to take on excessive debt, reduce R&D; spending, advocate for a break-up of the company or move the company out of its headquarters in Cincinnati - demands Peltz had made during the proxy battle.  “I look forward to bringing fresh perspectives to the boardroom, and working collaboratively with (CEO) David and the rest of the board to drive sustainable long-term shareholder value at P&G;,” Peltz said in an email. Peltz’s appointment is the latest twist in a contest that saw the two sides collectively spend more than an estimated $100 million on mailings, phone calls and advertisements to woo investors. Peltz’s appointment is effective March 1 and the company also committed to re-nominate the investor as part of its board slate for next year’s annual meeting, P&G; said. The company also said it would link executive compensation to its sales and stock performance.

715,PG,P&G; appoints Peltz to board despite losing proxy battle,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) said it appointed Nelson Peltz to its board despite the activist investor narrowly losing a months-long proxy fight, the biggest ever involving a U.S. company. The company’s shares were up 1 percent in after-market trading on Friday. Immediately after its annual meeting in mid-October, P&G; said it beat Peltz by a slim margin, but a preliminary tally by an independent election inspector, released a month later, showed otherwise. “Because the election results were so close, and because a large number of shareholders voted for Nelson Peltz to be a director, the board has engaged in numerous discussions with Mr. Peltz regarding a board seat,” P&G; said on Friday. The consumer goods conglomerate said it increased its board size by 2 to 13 - to accommodate Peltz and appoint a new director in Joseph Jimenez, CEO of drugmaker Novartis AG <NOV N.S>. P&G; said it had recounted nearly two billion votes, many of which were paper ballots.   The recount showed that shareholders elected all eleven P&G; nominees, including Ernesto Zedillo, for whom the votes cast were extremely close to those for Peltz.  Following recent discussions, Peltz and P&G; agreed that the company would not be predisposed to take on excessive debt, reduce R&D; spending, advocate for a break-up of the company or move the company out of its headquarters in Cincinnati - demands Peltz had made during the proxy battle.  “I look forward to bringing fresh perspectives to the boardroom, and working collaboratively with (CEO) David and the rest of the board to drive sustainable long-term shareholder value at P&G;,” Peltz said in an email. Peltz’s appointment is the latest twist in a contest that saw the two sides collectively spend more than an estimated $100 million on mailings, phone calls and advertisements to woo investors. Peltz’s appointment is effective March 1 and the company also committed to re-nominate the investor as part of its board slate for next year’s annual meeting, P&G; said. The company also said it would link executive compensation to its sales and stock performance.

719,PG,"P&G; second quarter beats, but margins worry investors","(Reuters) - The world’s largest consumer goods maker Procter & Gamble Co reported better-than-expected sales and profit for its second quarter on Tuesday, but investors focused on a drop in gross margins, sending its shares down 2 percent.  Margins fell by nearly 1 percent in the quarter, hit by higher commodity costs, investment outlays and cuts in prices in the grooming business that includes Gillette razorblades. The company has just quelled activist investor Nelson Peltz’s attacks on its strategy by offering him a board seat but is struggling to boost Gillette sales against cheaper competitors like Unilever’s Dollar Shave Club. It has reduced prices on the shaving products, upping volume growth but eating into profits and headline revenue from one of its biggest businesses. Some of that was offset by its efforts to pour more money into other lines including beauty and health care, leading to a 2 percent increase in organic sales.  Analysts, however, characterized the results as mixed and stopped short of predicting any upside for P&G; shares after a rally spurred by the proxy fight with Peltz. “Second quarter was not a quality beat, with gross margin lower than expected, and little near term benefit from the Tax Act,” Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in a note. The company said it was doing all it could against a social media fad that has teenagers daring each other to eat its Tide Pods laundry detergent live on video. “Our product labeling is clear ... but it can’t prevent intentional abuse fueled by poor judgment,” P&G;’s Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told a media call. “We’re going to have to work with the broader part of society to address that.” P&G; raised its full-year adjusted earnings per share growth forecast to 5-8 percent from 5-7 percent as it expects a $135 million net benefit from the recent U.S. tax overhaul, which sees corporate taxes falling to 21 percent.        Net income attributable to the company fell to $2.50 billion, or 93 cents per share, in the second quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with $7.88 billion, or $2.88 per share, a year earlier.     The company said the drop reflects a net charge of $628 million it took related to the tax overhaul and a gain it incurred from the sale of a chunk of its beauty brands to Coty Inc in the same period last fiscal year.     Excluding items, the company earned $1.19 per share, including a 5 cent benefit from the tax changes. Analysts had expected $1.14 per share, but several Wall Street brokerages said those estimates did not account for the tax benefit. Net sales rose 3 percent to $17.4 billion, boosted by strong Demand for Olay skincare products and its high-end SK-II brand and brisk sales of Oral-B toothbrushes as well as Vicks cough and cold products in a colder-than-usual winter season.  P&G;’s shares, which have risen 9.3 percent in 2017, were down 3 percent at $89.54.

Netflix touched a record high of $257.71 and was last up 9.98 percent at $250.29, to cross the $100 billion market value threshold. The video-streaming pioneer beat Wall Street targets for new subscribers in the fourth quarter.  Other stocks known as part of the “FAANG” group - Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet - also moved higher. Insurer Travelers provided the biggest boost to the Dow, up 4.96 percent after profit topped estimates. “There has not been another time in this recovery where Main Street was doing well, where every economy in the world was doing well, and where so far there isn’t really an overwhelming show that we have a significant inflation or interest rate problem which would mandate a valuation change,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.  Paulsen cautioned, however, that as the rally continued more challenges were mounting that could cause a pullback. “If it ever does turn, there could be a fair amount of correction,” he said.  The S&P; 500 has reached a streak of 396 trading days without a 5-percent correction, according to LPL Financial, the longest on record.

728,PG,P&G; says Tide Pods withdrawal tweet a hoax,"Jan 25 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co said on Thursday it was not stopping sales of Tide Pods, after rumors circulated on social media that the company was pulling the detergent from shelves beginning February. A tweet, marked with Tide branding and circulated as a screenshot on social media platforms on Thursday, was a hoax, representatives of the world’s biggest consumer goods company said. The tweet read: “We regret to inform you, we will be removing Tide Pods from shelves starting February 1. It’s been a good run, but we can’t risk lives over having clean clothes. It followed the circulation of a series of videos of teenagers consuming the brightly colored detergent sachets and then daring others to do the same “Tide Pod challenge”. “We are not discontinuing Tide Pods,” the company said in an emailed statement. “They are used safely by millions of people around the world and we will continue to offer them, in addition to other detergent forms from Tide.” On Tuesday, the company had said it was doing all it could to stop the challenge.

729,PG,Exclusive: J&J; out of race for Pfizer's $20 billion consumer unit as deadline looms,"LONDON/NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) has pulled out of the race to buy Pfizer’s (PFE.N) consumer health business, leaving GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L) among those preparing bids, according to sources familiar with the matter. Bidders have until Feb. 1 to submit their non-binding offers for the unit, which makes Advil painkiller, Centrum multivitamins and Chapstick lip balm, five banking sources said. U.S. drugmaker Pfizer, which has not made public any details about the sale process, wants to sell the business for no less than $20 billion, two of the sources added. J&J; was widely seen as one of the strongest contenders as the American healthcare giant wants to continue expanding its portfolio and has the financial muscle for a big acquisition. It initially worked with Goldman Sachs on a possible bid but subsequently decided to pull out, the sources said. “While we would normally not comment on market speculation or rumors, in this instance we refute assertions that we are in negotiation for Pfizer’s consumer business,” J&J;’s vice president of media relations Ernie Knewitz told Reuters. Goldman was not immediately available to comment. GSK has hired JPMorgan and Citi to work on the deal, while Reckitt has turned to Bank of America, the five sources said. Britain’s GSK and Reckitt declined to comment, as did JPMorgan, while Citi and Bank of America were not available. A spokeswoman for Pfizer, whose CEO Ian Read wants to focus on prescription medicines, declined to comment on the sale process, saying only that any decision on the future of the unit would be made in 2018.  The deal could be a game-changer for rival drugmaker GSK or consumer goods group Reckitt by making them one of the biggest global players in consumer health, an increasingly lucrative sector as ageing populations and health-conscious consumers drive demand for self-medication. Although consumer remedies sold over the counter have lower margins than prescription drugs, they are typically very well known and durable brands with loyal customers.  The prospective sale, which is being organized by Centerview Partners, Guggenheim Securities and Morgan Stanley, was first mooted on Oct. 10, when Pfizer announced the strategic review for the unit, which had sales of about $3.4 billion in 2016.  Two of the sources said Pfizer valued the asset at more than 20 times its core earnings, or $20 billion, and was reluctant to accept less. But J&J;’s decision to steer clear leaves the drugmaker with one less big bidder, which may affect its negotiating power. Pfizer sold its previous consumer healthcare business to J&J; in 2006 for $16.6 billion and the U.S. group, with interests from baby powder to cancer drugs, had been seen as a logical buyer for the current assets.  Yet it could have faced possible antitrust problems if it beefs up its presence in the sector, said one of the sources who is familiar with the company. Pfizer aims to clinch a deal before the summer, another source said, adding that there had been enough interest in the asset to stage a competitive auction. A sale would confirm the consumer health sector, which is still fragmented, as fertile ground for deal-making following a spate of transactions in recent years. Other companies that are considering making bids include Swiss consumer food giant Nestle (NESN.S), said the five sources. Nestle’s CEO Mark Shneider is a healthcare veteran and wants a deeper focus on nutrition, health and wellness.  Nestle declined to comment. The firm recently sold its U.S. confectionery business to Italy’s Ferrero for $2.8 billion. It is now seeking to buy Merck KGaA’s (MRCG.DE) consumer health unit, sources have previously told Reuters, as part of its healthcare drive. But while Pfizer’s Centrum vitamin and Caltrate calcium supplements could fit with Nestle’s new strategic direction, the U.S. firm’s Advil painkillers and Robitussin cough medicine are far removed from its core businesses like coffee, chocolate and baby food, the sources said. A sixth source said Pfizer was likely to receive five or six bids in total. Pfizer CEO Read said on Oct. 31 that he expected no shortage of suitors for the business.   Reuters reported on Oct. 10 that established consumer health companies that may bid for Pfizer’s unit include Abbott (ABT.N) and Procter & Gamble (PG.N).

730,PG,Elliott turns to snail mail in NXP mom-and-pop investor campaign,"(Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp launched a campaign on Thursday to convince NXP Semiconductor NV (NXPI.O) mom-and-pop investors to shoot down a $38 billion deal to sell the semiconductor company to larger peer Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O). The campaign involves posting glossy presentations to tens of thousands of individual NXP shareholders, as opposed to institutional investors such as mutual funds. Such mom-and-pop investors account for an estimated 11.6 percent of NXP’s shareholder base. NXP shares ended trading on Wednesday at $120.32, significantly above Qualcomm’s $110 per share all-cash bid, indicating that most investors are betting on a sweeter offer. Elliott’s focus on individual shareholders, however, shows that the hedge fund is not willing to leave anything to chance. Such retail shareholder-focused campaigns are known to add hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions of dollars, to the cost of an activist shareholder campaign. Elliott declined to comment on how much it was spending on the move, which is the latest in a series of such campaigns against companies. Last year, Elliott paid for billboards in several Australian cities to get retail shareholders on its side in a fight against miner BHP Billiton Ltd (BHP.AX) (BLT.L). It also sent out video players to thousands of mom-and-pop shareholders as part of a campaign against metal manufacturer Arconic Inc’s (ARNC.N) management team last year. The cliffhanger proxy contest at Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) a few months ago, in which activist hedge fund Trian Partners LP claimed victory against the consumer goods company with a margin of 0.0016 percent of the shares outstanding, or just 42,780 votes, following the most expensive shareholder activist campaign in history, has reinforced the importance of individual investors. The outcome of that shareholder vote was disputed, but Procter & Gamble ended up agreeing to add Trian Chief Executive Nelson Peltz to its board of directors.   Between 70 percent and 80 percent of NXP shareholders must agree to tender their shares for the deal with Qualcomm to go through. The tender offer deadline has been pushed back while the deal awaits regulatory approvals globally. Only China has yet to give the green light to the deal, something that Qualcomm expects to happen this month, sources have said. “If you accept Qualcomm’s current offer price, you risk losing money,” Elliott said in the eight-page mailing reviewed by Reuters on Thursday. Elliott, run by billionaire investor Paul Singer, owns a 7.2 percent stake in NXP worth roughly $3 billion.  Elliott’s presentation said $135 per share before a takeover premium would be a reasonable price for NXP, based on a financial analysis done by the hedge fund and its financial adviser UBS Group AG (UBSG.S). Qualcomm CEO Steven Mollenkopf reiterated on the company’s earnings call on Wednesday that buying NXP at $110 per share is an “attractive deal.” Qualcomm is also trying to defend itself against a $103 billion cash-and-stock bid from Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) and Mollenkopf has been seeking to make the case to his shareholders that Broadcom’s bid is inadequate.

731,PG,UPDATE 1-FOCUS-Walmart makes push to sell online goods at $10 and up to capture elusive e-commerce profit,"* New focus on dry grocery products, general merchandise * Move aims to avoid selling goods online at a loss * Walmart still committed to “Every Day Low Prices” (Updates with details in paragraphs 8-11) By Nandita Bose Feb 8 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc is asking vendors to supply it with more merchandise priced at $10 and up, as part of a major push to finally turn a profit at its online business, according to four people with knowledge of the matter. The new focus at the world’s largest retailer is on dry grocery products such as sauces, soaps and general merchandise items such as toys and home furnishings, the sources said. Walmart’s goal is to see higher profit margins selling these more expensive items given the built-in cost of delivering goods purchased online, according to the people familiar with Walmart’s new strategy. Shipping Gillette Mach 3 Disposable Razors at $6.97, for example, costs the same as Gillette Fusion5 ProGlide Men’s Razor Refills at $12.97. In meetings last week with suppliers including Procter & Gamble Co, Unilever PLC, Kimberly-Clark Corp and Clorox Co, Walmart’s e-commerce chief Marc Lore said Walmart.com wants to focus on merchandise priced at least $5 and preferably, more than $10, the people said. “Walmart has started to understand it cannot make money if they offer the lowest prices online on every item and then spend $4 or $5 trying to ship it over,” said one supplier present at the meetings. “It is not sustainable and more importantly their shareholders won’t allow it.” Walmart’s directive to suppliers marks a shift in strategy. The retailer for years has squeezed suppliers for pennies to drive the lowest prices for shoppers, both online and at its brick-and-mortar stores. Walmart will continue to press for bargain-priced items to sell at its 4,700 stores. But in addition, it will now implore suppliers to provide it with more expensive goods for sale online. Walmart does not disclose profit margins for individual products. But it tends to sell lower-priced merchandise at retail prices that are extremely close to its wholesale cost, and seeks to profit by selling large quantities of that merchandise across its brick-and-mortar stores. Because Walmart.com offers free two-day shipping to draw in buyers, turning a profit on items that retail for $5 or $10 is difficult. Consider a $3.50 tube of toothpaste. A supplier may incur $2.50 in costs to manufacture, transport and store it, selling the toothpaste to Walmart at $3 wholesale. The margin to Walmart on such an item is 50 cents if a shopper buys it at the store. But add $2 of shipping costs to get that toothpaste from Walmart’s distribution center to the home of a Walmart.com shopper, and the transaction is a loss to Walmart. The same tube of toothpaste in a different package, bigger in size, may sell for $6.50. It may cost the supplier $3, and Walmart may buy it wholesale at $3.75. When Walmart.com incurs the same $2 shipping cost to send it out to a shopper’s home, the retailer makes a profit of 75 cents. This new emphasis on more higher-priced goods at Walmart.com comes after the retailer acquired Jet.com in 2016 and is investing billions of dollars to make its online business more competitive. Walmart declined to comment on the meetings, but affirmed its commitment to “Every Day Low Prices” and offering the best prices online. “We are constantly looking for opportunities to expand our assortment with new items, and want to ensure that the items we add to the assortment are a great value but also make economic sense for the channel,” a Walmart spokeswoman said. Two people present at the Walmart meetings in Bentonville, Ark. - who were not authorized to speak on the record - said Walmart wants to avoid selling products online at a loss like rival Amazon.com Inc, where there is much less of a focus on retail profit. Seattle-based Amazon profits on many but not all transactions, depending on price-matching, an order’s size, shipping speed and other factors. While Amazon has pressured suppliers for discounts usually given to bigger retailers, a person familiar with the matter said, it has been happy to sell popular items at cost or even at a loss if it means winning customers’ loyalty over the long term. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2BGby73. Amazon has a diverse array of profitable businesses to offset its retail losses, including commissions for third-party sales on its site, advertising sales and a business handling large enterprises’ computing needs in the cloud. Amazon accounted for 43.5 percent of U.S. e-commerce sales in the 12 months to October 2017, compared to Walmart’s 3.6 percent, according to digital research firm eMarketer. Walmart.com has tripled the items it sells to 70 million in the past year. It is looking to grow that fast, as it plays catch up with Amazon’s more than 300 million products for sale. Walmart.com already had begun to raise prices on some items sold online last year. By now enlisting suppliers to provide it with higher priced goods, it is taking that strategy a step further. The move to offer more $10-and-up merchandise for sale online carries significant risk if bargain hunters reject the push and seek lower-priced goods elsewhere. A majority of Walmart’s low-income customers still tend to shop at its brick-and-mortar stores. But the retailer, with $485 billion in annual sales, is trying to attract a slightly more affluent audience to Walmart.com. For some suppliers, Walmart’s directive will entail going back to the drawing board and coming up with new items to sell on Walmart.com. That, in turn, will require planning and investment in new product design, packaging, marketing and sales. One Walmart vendor said that more than 95 percent of its merchandise currently for sale on Walmart.com is priced between $3 and $8. Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark and Unilever declined to comment. Clorox did not respond to requests for comment. “They are no longer saying ‘give us the lowest priced product for dot com,’” said one person present at the meetings, referring to Walmart.com. “They want items that retail for more than $10; those are the products that make money for them online.” ",2082018,http://www.reuters.com/article/walmart-online/update-1-focus-walmart-makes-push-to-sell-online-goods-at-10-and-up-to-capture-elusive-e-commerce-profit-idUSL2N1PY2KK
732,PG,Coty shares sparkle as profit beats on newly acquired brands,"(Reuters) - Beauty products maker Coty Inc (COTY.N) reported quarterly results on Thursday that beat analysts’ estimates, driven by strong demand for its recently acquired makeup and hair styling appliance brands, sending its shares up 12 percent. Once a pure-play fragrance maker, Coty entered the beauty space in earnest with its acquisition of nearly 40 brands from Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) last year. That acquisition gave it well-known brands such as Clairol, Wella, Max Factor and CoverGirl, that were popular with baby boomers but not so much with millennials. To bolster its offerings for a younger demographic, the company added cosmetics brand Younique and hair appliance brand ghd to its portfolio. These new brands helped boost revenue by about 15 percent to $2.64 billion for the second quarter ended Dec. 31. High-end fragrances from Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) and Gucci also gave a fillip to sales. Analysts on average had expected the company to report revenue of $2.48 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Organic net revenues rose 2.8 percent on a constant currency basis in the reported quarter. “Q2 was another quarter with solid results that gives us tangible signs that our strategy is starting to bear fruit,” Chief Financial Officer Patrice de Talhouët said on a conference call adding that the company was on track to post modest organic net revenue growth in the second half of 2018. The company had previously anticipated revenue growth to be flat for the same period. The company's shares rose as much as 15.8 percent to $20.24. The stock was also the top percent gainer on the S&P; 500 index .SPX. The company on the conference call also said it was rebranding its CoverGirl, Clairol and Max Factor products, to attract younger spenders and compete with affordable and Instagram-popular brands like NYX, Winky Lux and ColourPop. Coty is also partnering with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) to launch a personalized beauty tool that will help users choose products from its consumer beauty segment. Net income more than doubled to $109.2 million, or 15 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $46.8 million, or 6 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 32 cents per share, beating analysts’ estimates of 23 cents.

That, in turn, will require planning and investment in new product design, packaging, marketing and sales. One Walmart vendor said that more than 95 percent of its merchandise currently for sale on Walmart.com is priced between $3 and $8. Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark and Unilever declined to comment. Clorox did not respond to requests for comment. “They are no longer saying ‘give us the lowest priced product for dot com,’” said one person present at the meetings, referring to Walmart.com. “They want items that retail for more than $10; those are the products that make money for them online.” ",2082018,http://www.reuters.com/article/walmart-online/focus-walmart-makes-push-to-sell-online-goods-at-10-and-up-to-capture-elusive-e-commerce-profit-idUSL2N1PX0QO
736,PG,P&G; says cut digital ad spend by $200 million in 2017,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) said on Thursday it cut digital advertising spend by $200 million last year based on viewership data provided by tech and media companies that showed its ads were not reaching its target audience effectively.  P&G;, the world’s biggest advertiser, has been at the forefront of a campaign to pressure digital media companies to be transparent with their viewership metrics by telling them how many people see their ads and how ad agencies spend advertising dollars. These efforts have led tech companies such as Facebook (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) YouTube to rework algorithms to check content quality, empower marketers with more control on their ads and protect them from being associated with unrelated or inappropriate content.  “Transparency shined a spotlight on reality and we learned valuable lessons which are driving profound change,” Marc Pritchard, P&G;’s chief brand officer said at the Association of National Advertisers’  media conference in Orlando, Florida on Thursday.  “With transparent viewability data, we learned that the average view time for an ad on a mobile newsfeed is 1.7 seconds – little more than a glance – pushing us to innovate.”  Pritchard said fresh data on ad consumption encouraged P&G; to reduce digital spending to several big media companies by 20 percent to 50 percent last year.   The consumer goods conglomerate said it cut digital spending by more $100 million between April and June of 2017 and continued with the cuts at the same rate for the rest of the year. P&G;, however, has not cut overall media spending. Funds have been reinvested to increase media reach, including in areas such as TV, audio and ecommerce media, a company spokeswoman told Reuters. P&G;’s advertising costs, which includes spends on worldwide television, print, radio, internet and in-store advertising, were $7.1 billion in 2017, down from $7.2 billion in 2016. Its digital spending amounts to a third of the total spend.    ",3012018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-procter-gamble-advertising/pg-says-cut-digital-ad-spend-by-200-million-in-2017-idUSKCN1GD654

746,PG,UPDATE 1-Supermarkets Edeka and Coop expand Nestle boycott - media,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Two retailers have expanded their boycott of Nestle (NESN.S) products, according to media reports, raising pressure on the Swiss group in a pricing stand-off with several European supermarkets. Germany’s largest supermarket group Edeka has written to its stores recommending that they drop more Nestle products in an escalation of a pricing row between the world’s biggest packaged food maker and European retailers, a trade journal reported. Swiss retailer Coop, one of the country’s largest food chains, has also boycotted a further 59 products, including well-known Maggi seasonings, according to Swiss paper Blick. Nestle has for several months been facing off with AgeCore, a Geneva-based group representing six European retailers, including Edeka and Coop, which is seeking better supply terms.  The spat is the latest sign of tension between retailers and suppliers at a time of changing consumer tastes and new online competition. Nestle, which in February reported its weakest annual sales growth in at least two decades, is under heavy shareholder pressure to boost sales and profit margins. German trade journal Lebensmittel Zeitung cited a letter that Edeka had sent its 5,900 supermarkets suggesting that they stop ordering more Nestle products including KitKat chocolate bars, Vittel drinks and Wagner frozen pizza. The boycott had, so far, affected 163 Nestle products, equal to around 20 percent of the revenue that Edeka generates from Nestle products, the magazine reported late on Thursday. That figure will rise to 30 percent with the expanded measures, the magazine said, without saying how many products would be affected. Edeka declined to comment.  A Coop spokesman told website 20 Minuten that the chain’s boycott currently affected over 200 products, but the group later declined to comment on ongoing negotiations to Reuters.  In February, Coop said it had stopped orders of more than 150 Nestle products, including Cailler Perle chocolate, Nescafe Azera coffee and pizza brand Buitoni La Fina, demanding better supply conditions. A Nestle spokesman referred to comments the company’s Chief Executive Mark Schneider made to a newspaper last week, while declining to provide further information. Schneider had told Neue Zuercher Zeitung in an interview that Nestle was still negotiating with Agecore to end the spat and hoped to find a sensible solution. “This aggressive approach, coordinated across Europe, (of withdrawing products from supermarket shelves to enforce price reductions) is new in particular for Switzerland,” Schneider said. Major consumer goods groups like Nestle, Unilever (ULVR.L) and Procter & Gamble (PG.N) are grappling with slower sales as consumers migrate toward healthier food and independent brands. They try to offset that by selling more higher-priced items, but the retailers are reluctant to put up prices as they face their own battle with changing shopping habits and online players like Amazon.com (AMZN.O). In March last year, Britain’s Tesco (TSCO.L) supermarket chain stopped selling several Heineken (HEIN.AS) beers, and in October 2016, Unilever (ULVR.L) and Tesco had a row dubbed “Marmitegate” by the British press after the spread disappeared from some shelves.

748,PG,UPDATE 3-P&G; to buy German Merck's consumer health unit for $4.2 bln,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (P&G;) has agreed to acquire Merck KGaA’s consumer health unit for 3.4 billion euros ($4.2 billion), giving it vitamin brands such as Seven Seas and greater exposure to Latin American and Asian markets. The maker of Pampers diapers and Gillette razors said the deal would help it expand its portfolio of consumer healthcare products which includes Vicks cold relief.  The Merck unit includes vitamin brands Femibion and Neurobion. The deal follows GlaxoSmithKline agreeing to buy Novartis out of their consumer healthcare joint venture for $13 billion after dropping its pursuit of Pfizer’s consumer unit. Pfizer has struggled to divest the business for as much as $20 billion, after Reckitt Benckiser dropped out last month and Johnson & Johnson stepped away in January. Prescription-free remedies offer stable sales due to customers’ brand loyalty, albeit at lower margins than pharmaceuticals.  But intense price competition online, mainly from Amazon, as well as cheaper store-brand products have weighed on profits in the U.S. and other Western markets. U.S.-based P&G; derived 12 percent of group sales, or $7.5 billion, from health care products last year, including Oral-B toothbrushes and toothpastes.     The purchase price for Merck’s business suggests that the German company climbed down from price demands of as much as 4 billion euros, which sources told Reuters had deterred initial suitors such as Nestle, Perrigo and Stada owners Bain and Cinven. Morgan Stanley analyst Vincent Meunier said the price still implied a valuation of 4.7 times sales and around 19 times operating profit (EBITDA) for the business, at the high end of recent deals in the sector. “This will help (Merck) focus on its pharma unit and refurbish its pipeline,” he said. Merck shares were up 0.5 percent higher at 0833 GMT, among top gainers in the German blue-chip DAX index, having risen 1.2 percent earlier. Merck said that it fetched a multiple of about 19.5, above recent industry transactions and based on an adjusted “economically transferred” EBITDA of 173 million euros in 2017. The proceeds would allow it to reduce debt faster, giving its businesses, which include chemicals, pharmaceuticals and lab equipment, more flexibility, although it ruled out acquisitions worth more than 500 million euros this year. P&G; also announced it will split up its consumer care joint venture with Teva, PGT Healthcare, on July 1, saying strategies were no longer aligned.  PGT accounts for nearly all of P&G;’s personal health care sales outside of the United States. Teva said the terms of the agreement to terminate the JV with P&G; would not be disclosed and that the dissolution was amicable. Merck said the divestment of its consumer health business did not change its goal of keeping net sales of its established prescription drugs, such as Erbitux against cancer and multiple sclerosis treatment Rebif, organically stable until 2022. It will issue guidance for 2018 to reflect the sale of the consumer healthcare business with it publishes first-quarter financial results on May 15, it said. About 3,300 Merck employees could move to P&G; upon completion of the transaction, which is expected by the fourth quarter.  As part of the deal, P&G; will buy a majority stake in the German company’s Indian consumer health business, Merck Ltd, and subsequently make a mandatory tender offer to minority shareholders.  A final agreement with P&G; on Merck’s French consumer health business has yet to be worked out with labor representatives but that will not change the overall price agreed with P&G.; JP Morgan acted as financial adviser to Merck on the transaction, and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer was legal adviser.

749,PG,"P&G;, Nestle, Unilever forgo price increases to move product","ZURICH/LONDON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Quarterly sales growth at Nestle, Procter & Gamble and Unilever was driven almost entirely by shifting more goods, in a stark illustration of how hard it is for consumer products makers to raise prices in a competitive retail environment. Multinational makers of everything from soup to soap are under pressure to boost revenues as consumers flock to fresher products and newer brands. The large retailers they sell through face their own pressure to keep prices down, as they battle new competition from drugstores and Amazon.com. The result has been mounting tension, which recently erupted in a clash between Nestle and European retailers that saw some of the Swiss company’s goods briefly taken off store shelves. That row was itself an echo of a 2016 standoff between Unilever and British supermarket giant Tesco. On Thursday, results from both European manufacturers suggested those tensions remain high. Nestle’s 2.8-percent underlying sales growth only got a 0.2 percent boost from higher prices, and Unilever’s 3.4 percent growth just a 0.1 percent lift.  “We expect chronically weak pricing from both Unilever and Nestle to play to the market’s fears of weak pricing power, fueled by channel shift, in the face of rising commodities (prices),” Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo said. The pricing pressure was even tougher for Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer goods maker, which on Thursday reported a disappointing 1-percent rise in third-quarter organic sales as lower prices offset a 2-percent rise in the volume of goods moved. “What is clear is what it takes to win has gotten more difficult,” P&G; Chief Executive David Taylor said on a post-earnings call.  The maker of Gillette razors, which said sales would continue to hurt from pricing in the fourth quarter, flagged higher transportation costs in addition to pressure from struggling retailers and rising commodities prices. Railroads and truck fleets have raised prices amid a shortage of drivers, reduced capacity, higher fuel prices and a strengthening U.S. economy. “I think everybody is feeling this a little bit,” Unilever Finance Chief Graeme Pitkethly said, predicting that industrywide freight costs in the U.S. could rise by a high single-digit to double digit rate.  P&G; and Unilever shares fell more than 2 percent, while Nestle’s were up 0.2 percent. Nestle investors looked past the pricing issue at the Swiss food giant to the fact its overall sales exceeded expectations after several disappointing quarters. That beat, and a pick-up in volume, is welcome news for Nestle’s new CEO Mark Schneider, who took the top job at the maker of KitKat chocolate bars and Maggi soups in 2017 with the mission to return it to solid growth after six years of decline. Schneider said underlying growth would improve during 2018. “The mood of European consumers is proving to be rather less optimistic in the first quarter of 2018 than at the end of last year,” the group said on Thursday. “In France and Austria, in particular, the euphoria appears to have diminished temporarily in the wake of the elections.” Consumer goods makers and retailers are always in complex negotiations around pricing and promotions to suit their ambitions. If a manufacturer wants to take market share, it might discount; alternately, it may seek price increases to boost margins. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said trends suggested Unilever and some of its peers had “blinked a little” on pricing due to growing competition, even though they represent powerful, established brands.  “Brands are still a vital part of any company’s pricing power armoury but ... some companies are stronger in the food chain than others, depending on size, route to market and the availability of alternatives,” Mould said.  This is Unilever’s second quarter of volume-led sales growth, after several quarters fueled by pricing. CFO Pitkethly said the earlier price rises, and corresponding weak volume, were partly due to currency-related inflationary pressures in certain markets that have since abated, giving consumers more confidence to spend on everyday items.  As a result, sales volume in emerging markets, where Unilever does the majority of its sales, was ahead of expectations, according to Barclays analysts.  “The good news is when you have more muted pricing, more consumers buy more of your brands,” Pitkethly said, adding that minimal commodity price inflation had also inhibited the ability to raise prices.  He said the main pricing trouble spots were Brazil and Indonesia, which both saw prices fall due to weak consumer sentiment; India, due to a tax change put through last year; and Britain, where retail competition is fierce.  These four countries make up 25 percent of Unilever’s sales, Pitkethly said. Other countries, such as Turkey and Mexico, saw a good balance, he said.  The overall balance of price and volume would improve in the second half of the year, Pitkethly said. P&G; CFO Jon Moeller also said he expects pricing pressures to ease later this year. All three companies confirmed their sales guidance for the year, with Nestle aiming for 2 percent to 4 percent underlying sales growth, Unilever looking for 3 to 5 percent growth and P&G; saying organic sales would be at the lower end of its 2 to 3 percent range.  Unilever said growth in the second quarter would be near the lower end of the range. Nestle also said it was on track to return to mid-single-digit underlying sales growth by 2020.

751,PG,"US STOCKS-Apple, Philip Morris, chip stocks lead Wall Street slide","* Apple, chip stocks tumble on TSMC’s weak demand forecast * P&G;, Philip Morris weigh on consumer staples sector * AmEx jumps after strong results, leads financial higher * Amazon gains after reporting 100 mln Prime members * Indexes down: Dow 0.23 pct, S&P; 0.58 pct, Nasdaq 0.73 pct (Changes comment, adds details, updates prices) By Sruthi Shankar April 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dropped on Thursday, weighed down by a broad-based decline in technology stocks from Apple to chipmakers as well as a tumble in consumer staples such as Philip Morris and P&G.; A warning from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), the world’s largest contract chipmaker and an Apple supplier, on soft demand for smartphones and on the semiconductor industry’s growth this year sparked a tumble in chip stocks. Apple’s shares also fell 2.3 percent, with analysts telling Reuters that TSMC’s warning was related to the iPhone maker. Apple was the biggest drag on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq. TSMC’s U.S.-listed shares fell 6.3 percent. Intel declined 3.1 percent, falling the most on the Dow. All stocks on the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index were in the red, with the index itself tumbling 3.9 percent. The S&P; consumer staples sector declined 3.2 percent as Philip Morris plunged 17.4 percent after the tobacco company’s weak results and forecast. Philip Morris was the biggest drag on the S&P; and also dragged rival Altria down 7.8 percent. Also weighing was Procter & Gamble, which dropped 2.5 percent after the Dow component said shrinking retailer inventories and higher commodities and transportation costs squeezed its margins. At 11:23 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 57.28 points, or 0.23 percent, at 24,690.79, the S&P; 500 was down 15.70 points, or 0.58 percent, at 2,692.94 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 53.47 points, or 0.73 percent, at 7,241.77. Still, not everything was gloomy. The financial sector was up a healthy 1.1 percent, helped by a jump in American Express and as bank stocks bounced with 10-year Treasury yields reaching near one-month highs. AmEx jumped 7.1 percent after the credit card issuer topped Wall Street profit estimates as record investments in card rewards contributed to higher customer spending. “What’s happening in this season is even if you meet, that’s not good enough, you’ve got to beat convincingly,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. Of the 52 companies among the S&P; 500 that have reported first-quarter earnings through Wednesday, 78.8 percent topped profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data.

752,PG,"US STOCKS-Apple, P&G; and chip stocks lead Wall St lower","* Chip stocks tumble on TSMC’s weak industry outlook * P&G;, Philip Morris weigh on consumer staples sector * AmEx jumps after strong results, leads financial higher * Amazon gains after reporting 100 mln Prime members * Indexes down: Dow 0.37 pct, S&P; 0.50 pct, Nasdaq 0.53 pct (Updates to open) By Sruthi Shankar April 19 (Reuters) - Wall Street slid on Thursday morning, weighed down by a broad-based slump in technology stocks from Apple to chipmakers as well as a tumble in consumer staples such as Procter & Gamble. A warning from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), the world’s largest contract chipmaker and an Apple supplier, on soft demand for smartphones and on the semiconductor industry’s growth this year sparked a tumble in chip stocks. TSMC’s U.S.-listed shares fell 5.2 percent. Intel declined 2.2 percent and Nvidia sank 1.7 percent. Each of the stocks on the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index was in the red, with the index down 2.7 percent. Apple shares also fell 1.8 percent, with at least two analysts blaming the decline on TSMC’s warning. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq. At 9:54 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 92.72 points, or 0.37 percent, at 24,655.35, the S&P; 500 was down 13.44 points, or 0.50 percent, at 2,695.20 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 38.37 points, or 0.53 percent, at 7,256.87. The consumer staples sector declined 2.5 percent. The biggest drag was a 12.5 percent drop in Philip Morris after its revenue missed estimates. Also weighing was Procter & Gamble, which dropped 3.2 percent after the Dow component said shrinking retailer inventories and higher commodities and transportation costs squeezed its margins. Still, not everything was gloomy. American Express was up 3.4 percent after the credit card issuer topped Wall Street profit estimates. That led the financial sector 0.8 higher, making it the only gainer among the 11 major S&P; sectors. Amazon gained 2.1 percent after the e-commerce retailer said it now has more than 100 million Amazon Prime members globally. “We are in a digestion period where we are inundated with massive amounts of information. On balance, things look great, the (profit) growth rate is at mid 20 percent on S&P;,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in Boston. Of the 52 companies among the S&P; 500 that have reported first-quarter earnings through Wednesday, 78.8 percent topped profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. Overall profits at S&P; 500 companies are expected to have increased 19.4 percent in the first quarter, the biggest in seven years. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.08-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.40-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P; index recorded 18 new 52-week highs and nine new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 66 new highs and 32 new lows.

753,PG,"UPDATE 2-P&G; earnings beat as struggling retailers, costs eat into margins","(Reuters) - The world’s largest consumer goods maker Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) narrowly beat quarterly earnings expectations on Thursday, saying shrinking retailer inventories and higher commodities and transportation costs squeezed margins. Shares in P&G; were down 2.4 percent in premarket trading, with lackluster third-quarter earnings and forecast dampening gains from P&G;’s earlier announcement that it was buying Merck KGaA’s (MRCG.DE) consumer health business for about 3.4 billion euros ($4.2 billion). The deal will give P&G; vitamin brands such as Seven Seas and greater exposure to Latin American and Asian markets. The maker of Pampers diapers and Gillette razors said it expects full-year organic sales growth at the low end of its 2 to 3 percent range. Overall, P&G; said it expects sales to rise about 3 percent, including acquisitions and divestitures. U.S. packaged goods companies, already struggling with lower demand and price tensions with retailers, have recently begun flagging higher commodities and transportation costs. Railroads and truck fleets have raised prices amid a shortage of drivers, reduced capacity, higher fuel prices and a strengthening U.S. economy. Sales are under pressure from lower prices, tightening inventories and growing private label brands at retailers including Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N), Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a call with journalists.  P&G; operates in several politically volatile markets where consumption is down, including Egypt, Brazil and Nigeria, Moeller added. Reported gross margin decreased by 100 basis points in the third quarter ended March 31. Net income attributable to the company fell to $2.51 billion, or 95 cents per share, compared with $2.52 billion, or 93 cents per share, a year earlier.  “Expectations were coming down entering the quarter, but organic sales growth was likely still below what investors were looking for,” Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said. Pricing is becoming an even bigger concern and fourth-quarter organic sales will need to accelerate to hit lowered full-year guidance, Herzog added.      Excluding items, the company earned $1 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 4.3 percent to $16.28 billion, helped by demand for skincare products Olay and SK-II, as well as fabric and home care products such as Febreze. Analysts had expected sales of $16.21 billion. P&G; also said on Thursday that it was ending its PGT Healthcare joint venture with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.N), saying its priorities and strategies were no longer aligned with Teva’s.

754,PG,Breakingviews - P&G; drug deal needs vitamin shot to persuade Peltz,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Buying stuff is not the standard prescription for companies under pressure from activist investors. Procter & Gamble’s 3.4 billion euro splurge on Merck KGaA’s consumer unit, the maker of Seven Seas vitamin pills, will need a booster shot to earn the support of newly appointed board member Nelson Peltz. Parting with its portfolio of self-declared “lovebrands” is a good move for the German group, which is unconnected to the U.S. pharmaceutical giant of the same name. Merck makes most of its revenue selling prescription medicines and crystals used in smartphones or televisions. That makes it an illogical owner for over-the-counter drugs like pregnancy supplement Femibion. The sector is consolidating, and may come under pressure as consumers switch to online suppliers such as Amazon. Given those challenges, Merck has secured a good price. The deal values the business at 3.7 times last year’s sales, higher than the 3.3 times that Nestlé paid for vitamin maker Atrium in December. The appeal for P&G; is less clear. Admittedly it is buying a relatively robust business which has seen revenue grow by 6 percent annually over the past two years. That sounds appealing given the sluggish 1 percent sales growth P&G; reported in its healthcare division in the quarter ending March. The new owner should also be able to boost margins. The Merck business generated operating profit of 140 million euros last year, equivalent to a margin of just over 15 percent. Assume P&G; can ramp up the unit’s sales growth to 8 percent a year, and slice 10 percent off its cost base, boosting the operating margin to 25 percent. After five years, the business would bring in roughly 244 million euros after tax. The return on invested capital would just scrape over 7 percent, in line with P&G;’s cost of capital. Those are quite bold assumptions. And P&G; might struggle to integrate the business. Peltz argued last year that the Cincinnati-based company should do more deals, but criticised its integration of past acquisitions. True, the latest purchase is relatively small for the $197 billion group. But P&G; will have to work hard for it to pass the Peltz test.",4192018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-merck-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-pg-drug-deal-needs-vitamin-shot-to-persuade-peltz-idUSKBN1HQ1M6

759,PG,P&G;'s vitamin boost could signal more to come,"LONDON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble’s $4.2 billion deal for Merck’s vitamin and supplements business demonstrates that major consumer companies remain hungry for health-related products.  The fragmented nature of the sector and its appeal to younger consumers makes further M&A; activity a likely prospect even after a spate of recent acquisitions.   The U.S.-based maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors announced its plan on Thursday to buy Merck brands such as Seven Seas vitamins. It will become the fourth-biggest vitamin maker behind Amway, Pfizer and Nature’s Bounty, which KKR took over last year. Only last month cleaning products company Clorox agreed to buy multivitamin business Nutranext for $700 million and Nestle closed its $2.3 billion purchase of vitamin maker Atrium Innovations. The moves show how global consumer goods companies are looking to new, interesting areas to offset flagging growth in their core businesses. “Vitamins have become the flavor of the day,” Rakesh Kapoor, CEO of Britain’s Reckitt Benckiser, said on Friday. Reckitt’s supplement brands include MegaRed for heart health and Airborne for immunity.  The vitamins and supplements sector has also seen the emergence of new brands marketing themselves digitally and selling directly online to young consumers, said investment banker William Hood of William Hood & Co. “It’s what the millennials are buying and how they’re buying it,” Hood said. “Large companies are realising they need to figure it out ... It’s less about Vitamin A, B and C; it’s more about sleep or beauty.” A spokeswoman for P&G; declined to comment on its plans for the business. It acquired another small vitamin and supplements business in 2012 and owns other health brands including Vick’s, Metamucil and Pepto-Bismol. Globally, the vitamin and supplements category has grown by 5-7 percent annually for the past five years, according to Euromonitor. The category is highly fragmented, with market leader Amway Corp having only a 3.6 percent share, Euromonitor data shows. That implies that acquirers could could easily boost margins by building scale. Reckitt on Friday reported first-quarter sales numbers showing that the unit including vitamins, minerals and supplements (VMS) outpaced the wider group. P&G; had also been in talks with Pfizer about buying its consumer health business, home to Centrum vitamins and Advil pain killers, CNBC reported this month.   That auction, which Pfizer hoped would draw bids up to $20 billion, hit a roadblock after GlaxoSmithKline and Reckitt dropped out of the running. When asked about its interest in Pfizer on Thursday, P&G; chief executive David Taylor declined to comment. Referring to the P&G-Merck; deal, Liberum analyst Robert Waldschmidt said: “The question is: is it a prelude to more? ... Is P&G; still theoretically on the hunt for Pfizer?” Bernstein analysts noted that the Pfizer business may still be an acquisition candidate (for P&G;) because, on the surface, it doesn’t seem to raise antitrust concerns. There is another much smaller vitamin manufacturer in play, Nutri-Force. Retailer Vitamin Shoppe announced in February that it was exploring strategic options for the business, which it bought for $85 million in 2014. “Consumer health is a fragmented category and over a period of time, it is going to have more activity from an M&A; point of view,” Reckitt’s Kapoor said on Friday.

761,PG,End of Sorrell's reign heralds change for big ad empires,"LONDON (Reuters) - Martin Sorrell’s departure from the world’s biggest advertising company heralds change for his sprawling WPP empire and may accelerate a shake up of the big ad groups that followed his lead. WPP and its major rivals Omnicom, Publicis and IPG face challenges on every front, from the might of Google and Facebook - whom Sorrell famously dubbed “frenemies” - to the rapidly encroaching consultants Accenture and Deloitte. With clients demanding ever-lower fees, big advertising groups must learn to be more nimble and efficient to protect their revenues and avoid pressure on them to break up. “I don’t think this is the event that brings down the holding companies,” industry adviser and MediaLink Chief Executive Michael Kassan told Reuters. “I do believe this is going to force everybody to rethink.” Ad groups embark on their latest transformation without Sorrell, the godfather of the modern industry who quit after 33 years over an investigation into misconduct. WPP does not plan to release results of the probe. He denies the allegations. The clear industry leader WPP employs 200,000 staff who offer advertising, branding, media buying, lobbying and data analytics via more than 400 separate companies. Sorrell built up the group since the 1980s. When he set out, elaborate television campaigns ruled. Complexity was added as the ad market moved online and become more fragmented. The structure he began with, now looks dated. Several years of strong organic growth at WPP evaporated in 2017. In March, it said it did not expect to grow in 2018. WPP’s stock has fallen by a third in a year. FIS Astec Analytics, a data provider, says 51 million of WPP’s shares are on loan to short sellers, up from just 1 million a year ago.  WPP valuation has slid to 9.9 times future earnings, compared with a FTSE average of 13.6 times, while its big three rivals still boast multiples of 12 to 14 times. Sorrell’s resignation further dented WPP’s share price but the firm’s executives still say they are upbeat. “I think some people might feel a bit liberated,” Stephen Allan, who runs WPP’s media-buying agency MediaCom, told BBC radio.     WPP, the owner of agencies JWT and Ogilvy & Mather, has been  hit hard by a reduction in spending from the world’s biggest consumer goods groups, Unilever and Procter & Gamble, which complain about having to deal with WPP’s multiple agencies. They also want more transparency in how ads are viewed, after an Association of National Advertisers report showed some ads were only seen by bots and many were not watched at all. P&G; Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard said the media supply chain was “murky at best and fraudulent at worst”, adding it was time to end the era of “Mad Men”, referring to ad leaders in the 1960s credited with laying the foundations for the industry that Sorrell built on. Digital consultant Ian Maude said advertising agencies needed to provide creative services and strategies for planning and buying media space, all reinforced by data insight, public relations and input on how a user shops and acts online. “The question is whether the holding companies are the right structure any more and whether they can be turned into something that is nimble and agile in a reasonable timetable that is going to satisfy investors,” he said.   Sorrell said in March WPP would accelerate plans to break down barriers between agencies to create a cohesive global team.  That is not easy when many of them are run as individual entities competing with rivals inside and outside WPP. “WPP probably still has the best portfolio of assets,” said Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research. “It’s direction wasn’t wrong. The problem was one of execution and articulation.”  One group that is earning plaudits, however, is Publicis. Tech groups, independent agencies and consultants have told Reuters the French group has a more joined up offering. Run for decades by Sorrell’s rival Maurice Levy, Publicis set out plans in March under its new boss Arthur Sadoun to foster more collaboration between its agencies and to become a consulting and technology partner to global advertisers. Publicis on Thursday reported better-than-expected sales growth in the first quarter of this year. Omnicom, the biggest holding company in the United States, is also drawing together single teams from across its agencies to support individual clients. IPG, the fourth of the big four, has said it expects a stronger 2018 after a slow 2017.  Michael Farmer, author of the book Madison Avenue Manslaughter, says the holding companies need to stop accepting demands to produce more work for lower fees. He also said they need to compete more effectively for talent against firms such as Accenture. “The tipping point has been reached,” said Farmer, who works with advertising agencies and major brands such as Ford and Kraft on strategy. “WPP is not growing.” Mark Read, WPP’s co-Chief Operating Officer since Sorrell’s departure last weekend, told staff WPP needed to hold together. “There’s been speculation about breaking up the group. We don’t believe this makes sense,” he wrote in an email that was the first in the group’s history to go directly to all WPP staff worldwide. “We need to get closer together, not further apart.” To improve their offering, the ad groups could start by being more transparent. Michael Moszynski, previously of Saatchi who now runs the agency London Advertising, said clients wanted to see more clearly how their money was spent. And some clients remain loyal. A marketing chief at one major packaged goods company, who asked not to be named, told Reuters that WPP provided a powerful service, wrapping data analytics and insight with its creative work that helped clients navigate changing markets. WPP must now make that kind of joined up offering the norm if it is to avoid unraveling. But it will have to do this without Sorrell at the helm, which may prove tough. “It’s the fall of an emperor,” David Jones, the former CEO of WPP peer Havas, told Reuters. “One that I think will not only take the empire down with him but will also have massive ramifications for that entire industry.” ",4202018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wpp-ceo-industry/end-of-sorrells-reign-heralds-change-for-big-ad-empires-idUSKBN1HR0IV

Sorrell’s resignation further dented WPP’s share price but the firm’s executives still say they are upbeat. “I think some people might feel a bit liberated,” Stephen Allan, who runs WPP’s media-buying agency MediaCom, told BBC radio.     WPP, the owner of agencies JWT and Ogilvy & Mather, has been  hit hard by a reduction in spending from the world’s biggest consumer goods groups, Unilever and Procter & Gamble, which complain about having to deal with WPP’s multiple agencies. They also want more transparency in how ads are viewed, after an Association of National Advertisers report showed some ads were only seen by bots and many were not watched at all. P&G; Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard said the media supply chain was “murky at best and fraudulent at worst”, adding it was time to end the era of “Mad Men”, referring to ad leaders in the 1960s credited with laying the foundations for the industry that Sorrell built on. Digital consultant Ian Maude said advertising agencies needed to provide creative services and strategies for planning and buying media space, all reinforced by data insight, public relations and input on how a user shops and acts online. “The question is whether the holding companies are the right structure any more and whether they can be turned into something that is nimble and agile in a reasonable timetable that is going to satisfy investors,” he said.   Sorrell said in March WPP would accelerate plans to break down barriers between agencies to create a cohesive global team.  That is not easy when many of them are run as individual entities competing with rivals inside and outside WPP. “WPP probably still has the best portfolio of assets,” said Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research. “It’s direction wasn’t wrong. The problem was one of execution and articulation.”  One group that is earning plaudits, however, is Publicis. Tech groups, independent agencies and consultants have told Reuters the French group has a more joined up offering. Run for decades by Sorrell’s rival Maurice Levy, Publicis set out plans in March under its new boss Arthur Sadoun to foster more collaboration between its agencies and to become a consulting and technology partner to global advertisers. Publicis on Thursday reported better-than-expected sales growth in the first quarter of this year. Omnicom, the biggest holding company in the United States, is also drawing together single teams from across its agencies to support individual clients. IPG, the fourth of the big four, has said it expects a stronger 2018 after a slow 2017.  Michael Farmer, author of the book Madison Avenue Manslaughter, says the holding companies need to stop accepting demands to produce more work for lower fees. He also said they need to compete more effectively for talent against firms such as Accenture. “The tipping point has been reached,” said Farmer, who works with advertising agencies and major brands such as Ford and Kraft on strategy. “WPP is not growing.” Mark Read, WPP’s co-Chief Operating Officer since Sorrell’s departure last weekend, told staff WPP needed to hold together. “There’s been speculation about breaking up the group. We don’t believe this makes sense,” he wrote in an email that was the first in the group’s history to go directly to all WPP staff worldwide. “We need to get closer together, not further apart.” To improve their offering, the ad groups could start by being more transparent. Michael Moszynski, previously of Saatchi who now runs the agency London Advertising, said clients wanted to see more clearly how their money was spent. And some clients remain loyal. A marketing chief at one major packaged goods company, who asked not to be named, told Reuters that WPP provided a powerful service, wrapping data analytics and insight with its creative work that helped clients navigate changing markets. WPP must now make that kind of joined up offering the norm if it is to avoid unraveling. But it will have to do this without Sorrell at the helm, which may prove tough. “It’s the fall of an emperor,” David Jones, the former CEO of WPP peer Havas, told Reuters. “One that I think will not only take the empire down with him but will also have massive ramifications for that entire industry.” ",4202018,http://www.reuters.com/article/wpp-ceo-industry/end-of-sorrells-reign-heralds-change-for-big-ad-empires-idUSL8N1RV5LY
763,PG,P&G;'s vitamin boost could signal more to come,"LONDON/CHICAGO, April 20 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble’s $4.2 billion deal for Merck’s vitamin and supplements business is the latest example of a major consumer company stocking up on health-related products. The U.S.-based maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors announced the deal on Thursday, giving it brands such as Seven Seas vitamins and expanding its portfolio of healthcare products. Just last month, cleaning product maker Clorox Co agreed to buy multivitamin company Nutranext for $700 million. And in December, Nestle SA paid $2 billion for vitamin maker Atrium Innovations. The moves show how global consumer goods companies are looking to new, interesting areas to offset flagging growth in their core businesses. The vitamins and supplements sector is attractive due to the emergence of new brands marketing themselves digitally and selling directly online to young consumers, said investment banker William Hood of William Hood & Co. “It’s what the millennials are buying and how they’re buying it,” Hood said. “Large companies are realizing they need to figure it out.” A spokeswoman for P&G; declined to comment on the company’s strategy to expand its vitamins, minerals and supplements business. P&G; already owns consumer health brands including Vick’s, Metamucil and Pepto-Bismol. Globally, the vitamin and supplements category has grown between 5 and 7 percent annually for the past five years, according to Euromonitor. The category is very fragmented, with market leader Amway Corp having only 3.6 percent share, Euromonitor data showed. That implies a consolidator could easily boost margins by building scale. Consumer goods firm Reckitt Benckiser has owned Schiff, maker of MegaRed tablets for heart health and Airborne for immunity, for five years. It was a very different business to other health or home goods, said CEO Rakesh Kapoor on a post-earnings call in February, adding that sales and margins were improving after some stumbles. “This is a category which is here to stay. It is one of the single largest categories in health,” he said. P&G; was in talks with Pfizer about buying the U.S. drugmaker’s consumer health business, CNBC reported earlier this month. Pfizer hoped to bring in $20 billion through an auction for the business, which includes Centrum vitamins and Advil painkillers. The auction hit a roadblock after GlaxoSmithKline and Reckitt Benckiser dropped out of the running. When asked about its interest in Pfizer on Thursday, P&G; chief executive David Taylor declined to comment. Referring to the P&G-Merck; deal, Liberum analyst Robert Waldschmidt said: “The question is - is it a prelude to more? ... Is P&G; still theoretically on the hunt for Pfizer?” Bernstein analysts noted that the Pfizer business “may still be an acquisition candidate (for P&G;) since it doesn’t seem to raise anti-trust concerns on the surface.” ",4202018,http://www.reuters.com/article/procter-gamble-vitamins/pgs-vitamin-boost-could-signal-more-to-come-idUSL3N1RW5SC
764,PG,P&G; to buy German Merck's consumer health unit for $4.2 billion,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (P&G;) has agreed to acquire Merck KGaA’s consumer health unit for 3.4 billion euros ($4.2 billion), giving it vitamin brands such as Seven Seas and greater exposure to Latin American and Asian markets. The maker of Pampers diapers and Gillette razors said the deal would help it expand its portfolio of consumer healthcare products which includes Vicks cold relief.  The Merck unit includes vitamin brands Femibion and Neurobion. The deal follows GlaxoSmithKline agreeing to buy Novartis out of their consumer healthcare joint venture for $13 billion after dropping its pursuit of Pfizer’s consumer unit. Pfizer has struggled to divest the business for as much as $20 billion, after Reckitt Benckiser dropped out last month and Johnson & Johnson stepped away in January. Prescription-free remedies offer stable sales due to customers’ brand loyalty, albeit at lower margins than pharmaceuticals.  But intense price competition online, mainly from Amazon, as well as cheaper store-brand products have weighed on profits in the U.S. and other Western markets. U.S.-based P&G; derived 12 percent of group sales, or $7.5 billion, from health care products last year, including Oral-B toothbrushes and toothpastes.     The purchase price for Merck’s business suggests that the German company climbed down from price demands of as much as 4 billion euros, which sources told Reuters had deterred initial suitors such as Nestle, Perrigo and Stada owners Bain and Cinven. Morgan Stanley analyst Vincent Meunier said the price still implied a valuation of 4.7 times sales and around 19 times operating profit (EBITDA) for the business, at the high end of recent deals in the sector. “This will help (Merck) focus on its pharma unit and refurbish its pipeline,” he said. Merck shares were up 0.5 percent higher at 0833 GMT, among top gainers in the German blue-chip DAX index, having risen 1.2 percent earlier. Merck said that it fetched a multiple of about 19.5, above recent industry transactions and based on an adjusted “economically transferred” EBITDA of 173 million euros in 2017. The proceeds would allow it to reduce debt faster, giving its businesses, which include chemicals, pharmaceuticals and lab equipment, more flexibility, although it ruled out acquisitions worth more than 500 million euros this year. P&G; also announced it will split up its consumer care joint venture with Teva, PGT Healthcare, on July 1, saying strategies were no longer aligned.  PGT accounts for nearly all of P&G;’s personal health care sales outside of the United States. Teva said the terms of the agreement to terminate the JV with P&G; would not be disclosed and that the dissolution was amicable. Merck said the divestment of its consumer health business did not change its goal of keeping net sales of its established prescription drugs, such as Erbitux against cancer and multiple sclerosis treatment Rebif, organically stable until 2022. It will issue guidance for 2018 to reflect the sale of the consumer healthcare business with it publishes first-quarter financial results on May 15, it said. About 3,300 Merck employees could move to P&G; upon completion of the transaction, which is expected by the fourth quarter.  As part of the deal, P&G; will buy a majority stake in the German company’s Indian consumer health business, Merck Ltd, and subsequently make a mandatory tender offer to minority shareholders.  A final agreement with P&G; on Merck’s French consumer health business has yet to be worked out with labor representatives but that will not change the overall price agreed with P&G.; JP Morgan acted as financial adviser to Merck on the transaction, and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer was legal adviser.

765,PG,UPDATE 1-Siemens plans Power & Gas shutdowns due to power weakness,"MUNICH (Reuters) - Siemens said on Monday weakness in the power generation market is forcing it to temporarily shut down its Power & Gas (PG) sites around the world. Large gas turbines are increasingly unloved as the world shifts to renewable energy, which is weighing on Siemens’ earnings and prompting the group to restructure the PG business. In November, Siemens said it would cut 6,900 jobs, mainly at the PG division, which once thrived on supplying turbines for electricity generation. Excluding its services business, the PG division has around 30,000 employees worldwide, of which 12,000 are based in Germany. “The shutdowns are part of a comprehensive package of measures, which also includes issues such as travel costs, sponsoring, participation in trade fairs and investments,” Siemens said in a statement on Monday. Siemens said it aimed to temporarily shut down all of its PG sites after the Pentecost holiday later in May, depending on local regulation. It did not say how long each site would be closed for. In Siemens’ fiscal first quarter through end-December, the division’s profit nearly halved and its profit margin shrank from 12 percent to 7.6 percent, well below the target range of 11 to 15 percent. Analysts on average expect this to have accelerated in the second quarter, with the division’s profit seen down 62 percent from the year-earlier period, according to a Reuters poll.  Siemens is due to publish second-quarter results on Wednesday.
